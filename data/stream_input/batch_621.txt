That question, is what do you want to be remembered for? <br /> <br />I guess there are many other questions like what have you learned thus far in life, what would you pass on to others, what really matters, what would you do differently, what do you hope to still do. Mitch lets us see Morrie in so many ways, the way he is, the way he was as well as the way Mitch sees him and the way Morrie sees himself. <br /> <br />It's a rather quick read, but lessons will last years longer.

B000069HSP|4.0|Many Vietnam War movies to date have depicted the American soldier in Vietnam as either a sadistic murderer, at worse, or, at best, an ignorant robotic slave of the industrial-military complex.  This film about the early war Battle of Ia Drang depicts the American soldier as simply an ordinary person who has family and who is just trying to survive while surrounded by a North Vietnamese infantry force that is four times larger.  Unlike previous films, you will NOT see GIs shooting civilians for sport, raping Vietnamese girls, cussing like sailors, fooling around with prostitutes or just getting drunk.    What you WILL see are well-trained Americans fighting insurmountable odds while looking out for their brothers in arms.  Compared to more pessimistic movies like \\"Platoon\\" and \\"Full Metal Jacket\\", \\"We Were Soldiers\\" may come across as right-wing patriotic propaganda.  However, this movie's ultimate aim is to show what actually occurred at the combat field from a soldier's viewpoint rather than to preach to the public a pacifist political message about the Vietnam War or war in general.  One of my few complaints are 1) that the level of North Vietnamese casualties appeared exaggerated while that of the Americans appeared minimized, despite the 4 to 1 casuality ratio that actually occurred during that November 1965 battle, and 2) the climatic, but fictional, bayonet charge at the end that reminded me too much of a real bad patriotic war film also starring Mel Gibson.
B00000IMTF|5.0|It may seem a bit cynical to suggest that a band at the time so new peaked so soon, but I honestly believe that nothing they recorded after Ronnie James Dio left for Black Sabbath sounded half as interesting.  I didn't really pick up on Rainbow until I was in high school, and when I bought this LP, the band had already split, with Blackmore returning to the reformed Mk II lineup of Deep Purple.  This lineup's members, apart from Blackmore, continued on to varying degrees of success; Dio, after a brief tour of duty with Sabbath, went on to a very successful solo career.  Cozy Powell would briefly join with Greg Lake and Keith Emerson as one-third of ELP in the mid '80s, sadly dying some years later.  Jimmy Bain reconnected with Dio as his bassist on Dio's first solo album, Holy Diver, and Tony Carey had a fairly successful solo career, as well as putting together the proggish band Planet P.  And Mr. Blackmore, of course, would remain with DP for a while before getting thoroughly disgusted with his former bandmates and joining up with the lovely Candace Night in Blackmore's Night (and thereafter being snidely referred to by his ex-bandmates in Deep Purple as \\"the banjo player\\").<br /><br />So in my teenage travels through the world of classic rock, and especially into classics I might otherwise have missed, I found Rainbow Rising, and I must say that it truly sounds like nothing any of these musicians had done before or have done since.  \\"Tarot Woman\\" has, as another reviewer noted, an amazing keyboard intro courtesy of Tony Carey which, all by itself, would have cemented his place in the world of classic rock.  \\"Run With the Wolf\\" is the perfect hard rock song, the kind of thing that gets you playing air guitar quite un-self-consciously; and \\"Stargazer\\" is the ultimate marriage of prog and metal, fronted by Ronnie James Dio's ragged growl, Blackmore's guitar and Carey's keyboards.<br /><br />Yeah, this one's a keeper.  After Dio, they just weren't the same--neither Graham Bonnet, with his rock-star poses, nor Joe Lynn Turner, who was trying to be a mix of Ian Gillan and David Coverdale, quite had it.  Get Rising.er Graham Bonnet, with his rock-star poses, nor Joe Lynn Turner, who was trying to be a mix of Ian Gillan and David Coverdale, quite had it.  Get Rising.

B000FTWB7G|4.0|For all the real fans (real being people who like Amy and Ben not just Amy)you will deffinitely notice Ben's departure. I will say that I didn't expect anything good to come after Ben left but this cd is quite good.  <br />1. Sweet Sacrifice: It's very good, the chorus is awesome and the drums are amazing! <br />2. Call Me When You're Sober: This song is good but a little more commercial than you'd expect from the group. Almost made me pass up the album. <br />3. Weight of the World: Really easy to pass up if you're not carefull but after a rotation or two you'll love it. <br />4. Lithium: Not the type of ballad I expected, but I try not to compare it to My Immortal. It's okay but not one of the best tracks <br />5. Cloud Nine: I don't really like this song. They tried too hard, the music works but the lyrics just don't. <br />6. Snow White Queen: The title is better than the song, but the song isn't bad. It's got a pretty good melody to it. <br />7. Lacrymosa: It's a good song but not really distinctive. <br />8. Like You: My personal favorite. The melody is great, the music is great and I love the lyrics. A perfect song. <br />9. Lose Control: Another track I don't really care for. I can't really put my finger on the problem. <br />10. The Only One: Another perfect track. The guitar is great here and the lyrics are powerfull. <br />11. Your Star: Once again another fallen track. Just doesn't work at all. <br />12. All That I'm Living For: Deffinitely one of the best! The moment the track starts you'll love it! <br />13. Good Enough: This is one that I just can't seem to like no matter how much I try. I hope it grows on me. <br /> <br />That's pretty much the rundown. Like others have said, the album is nowhere near as diverse as Fallen was. That's how you can tell Ben is gone. There is no balance anymore. It's all Amy and as great as she is she can't carry the group by herself. Terry is good but I feel like he's trying too hard to sound like Ben. It's not his fault, he just doesn't have a choice because that's the Evanescence sound. I feel it's worth a buy because it's still a really good album. This album is great but Fallen was PERFECT. I'm still waiting to see what Ben will do! Also I suggest Origin if you don't have it. It'll show you what's missing!!!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I trully cannot stop listening to this album.  This is the album that John Mayer was born to make.  I was a big fan of Heavier Things but  Continuum trully validates John as the world class musician.  John Mayer breadth of musical ability is reflected in every track of on this album.  If you only buy one album this year, make it this one.
B000AY807Q|5.0|Prairie Wind is simply awesome.  It is shot for High Definition, wide Screen and if you have those with surround sound you will feel like you are at the concert.  The footage is remarkable and Neil sounds as good as always--maybe better.  He plays new music from the Prairie Wind CD and then ends with many of his greatest hits.  I watch it about once a week and everyone who I have had with me to view it have been floored by how good this is. If you like Neil Young at all then this is a must for your collection. Don't rent this.  Own It.

B000002C1W|5.0|AMLOR is a great PF album. I always enjoyed Floyd for the music rather than lyrics and so depart from the judgments of many of the Waters fans here. Floyd's progressive mix of R&B and dissonant guitar-driven sounds set them apart and it's on display here much more so than the followup Division Bell. This may be a Gilmour album in all but name, but that ain't necessarily a bad rap.
B000F8O35U|4.0|Unless you've been under a rock for the past twenty years, you're probably familiar with the story of Disney's \\"The Little Mermaid.\\"  Briefly, it's a tale of forbidden love.  A young mermaid (Ariel) longs to live topside with a young man called Eric.  Alas, her father doesn't want her going above the water because he worries about what might happen to her.  Throw in a bad deal made with a sea witch (the diabolically funny Ursula), a singing hermit crab, a friendly fish and a whacked-out seagull, and you've got all the fixin's necessary for a wonderful Disney tale.<br /><br />This platinum release of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" is packed with wonderful documentaries about the making of the little film that pretty much saved Disney's future, a short story set to music entitled \\"The Little Matchgirl,\\" and the expected deleted scenes and obligatory Disney Channel music video.  This particular video is by Ashley Tisdale of \\"The Suite Life Of Zack and Cody.\\"  She remakes \\"Kiss The Girl.\\"<br /><br />Another interesting feature on this edition is the \\"park ride that was almost built.\\"  It gives the viewer a sneak peek into what would have become a \\"Little Mermaid\\" ride at one of the Disney parks.  The Imagineers can be invited along for the ride to give a brief explanation of everything involved in the ride.  If you've ever been to a Disney theme park, you'll feel right at home on this \\"park ride.\\"<br /><br />Overall, this platinum edition is worth it for the film alone.  It's one of the last animated Disney films that still looks like a classic Disney film.  Long before the breakthrough technology of \\"Toy Story\\" and the rigid, yet interesting, design of \\"Hercules,\\" \\"The Little Mermaid\\" was a nod to a time from Disney's past where \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Peter Pan\\" ruled the big screen, and \\"Herbie\\" had yet to meet Lindsay Lohan.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This CD seems to have a lot of positive reviews, so I'll keep mine short.  I saw Three Days Grace in concert as an opening band a few years ago, and I liked them so much I went out and bought their first CD.  I really liked it, although there were a few songs on there I don't play that much.  But, the other songs made the CD a major favorite of mine.   <br /> <br />About two weeks ago, I saw the video for their song \\"Animal I Have Become,\\" and I was excited, since I figured they would have a new CD out soon.  So I was surprised when I checked Amazon and realized that I had missed the new CD's release.  I bought the CD, and I am very, very pleased with it.  I might have to place it as better than their first, because I love every song on the CD.  I have listened to it many times already, and I know I won't grow bored with the songs any time soon.  If you liked their first CD, I think the chances are good that you'll love \\"One X,\\" too!
B000G75AE8|2.0|This is a fast dark album that is really heavy, but its quite generic.  It seems like it was thrown together.  There isn't much that stands out, except the wanna be AC/DC intro in one of the songs.  I was strongly displeased with this album.  Granted its not as bad as the last 3 albums, but pretty close.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I was thrilled when I heard Evanescence would soon have another CD out.  After it came out (and I still hadn't bought it yet), I was vastly disappointed to hear a lot of negative comments about the CD.  I was going to wait until Amazon put up the 30 sec clips for the songs like they usually do, but then I found them somewhere else.  And from what I heard, I couldn't figure out why everyone was disappointed with the CD <br /> <br />So, I went out and bought it, because I love Evanescence.  The first time I listened to it, there were a few songs that caught my fancy, but I found myself wanting to side with those who didn't like it that much.  Then I decided that I was probably letting other people's reviews influence what I thought.  I listened to it again, and I definitely liked all the songs.  As with all CDs, I favored several songs more than others, but I generally loved the whole CD.   <br /> <br />My advice to someone who isn't sure if they want to spend the money on \\"The Open Door:\\"  Find those 30 second preview clips on the songs and see if you generally like them (I know it's hard to form an opinion from 30 seconds).  And don't think that everyone else's opinion must be right; although, I'm glad that I began to see a lot of other reviewers saying they enjoyed \\"The Open Door,\\" too.  I think this CD is worth the money, and I know I'll enjoy listening to it over and over again.  Amy Lee's vocals are superb, as usual, and the music has a haunting current in it.  Overall, I think it's pretty much on the same level as \\"Fallen\\" but a little better than \\"Origin.\\"
B00005JPAM|5.0|Long live Helen Mirren.<br /><br />It is a complete mystery to me why Helen Mirren and Meryl Streep don't work more. They are easily the two best actresses working in film. I would think directors would be bending over backward for the opportunity to work with these two accomplished thespians. Instead, they are more easily able to get films with Kirsten Dunst and Julie Stiles made. Amazing. It just isn't the same, folks. It isn't the same.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\", the new film from director Stephen Frears (\\"Dirty, Pretty Things\\", \\"The Crying Game\\"), concentrates on the week after Princess Diana's death. As the film progresses, we watch Queen Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) and Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) deal with the loss of someone in their lives as you would expect British Royalty to deal with such a thing, with a stiff upper lip. But this period is also significant in British history for another reason; a new Labour Prime Minister has just been elected. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) recognizes Diana's death will not remain the isolated family affair the Royals insist it will be. Through many conversations, Blair attempts to get the Queen to make some sort of statement regarding her former step-daughter's death, to make some sign for the benefit of a grieving public. But as she and the family are spending the summer at their estate in Balmoral, Scotland, she remains steadfast in her feeling that this is a private family affair and any public grief will soon wear off.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" is a remarkable film for two reasons; the first and foremost is Helen Mirren. She is, once again, superb. If she isn't at least nominated for an Oscar, there is something seriously wrong with the whole system.<br /><br />There is some humor in the film, but it is derived from watching the rigid ceremony and outdated tradition surrounding the family. Mirren could easily have portrayed the role as a jokey, caricature of the Queen, but her performance is much better, much more layered than that. She successfully paints a portrait of the Queen, and what her life is as a Royal, making the character, both good and bad, seem real. As she portrays the monarch, we watch as she moves through a life surrounded by tradition, a cocoon of advisors and servants, buffering her from the public, further reinforcing her feelings everything is going well. Convinced she is right, she doesn't heed the advice of her new Prime Minister, a figure she clearly `tolerates'. But as he continues to press the case, she gradually realizes he may be speaking the truth.<br /><br />Mirren does a brilliant job of making us understand this woman's feelings. It seems perfectly understandable she would be so reluctant to believe the public does not require some statement from the Royal family, this is a private family affair and the British people are stalwart and dignified. As she gradually, very gradually, realizes perhaps she does need to address the public, this also makes sense. She remembers she is in the public eye, a spokesperson for the people, perhaps she should say something.<br /><br />You have to remember Queen Elizabeth is part of a monarchy that has ruled England for centuries. There are traditions involved with the position and her life has been very different from a normal person. So, while her behavior may seem odd at first, we understand it through Mirren's performance. We certainly may not agree with it, but we see how it could happen. Throughout, there are many references to this, reminding us of the tradition the House of Windsor is steeped in.<br /><br />Mirren is simply outstanding. Have I said that already?<br /><br />The other person who is largely responsible for this film's success is director Stephen Frears. He keeps the film moving at a fast clip and the film is more entertaining for it. Usually, when you go to a biopic, you expect the film to reach the 2 hour plus mark. \\"The Queen\\" is a sprightly 95 minutes long. Becauseof this, Frears smartly concentrates on the week after Diana's death. He doesn't attempt to paint a complete picture of the monarch's life, choosing instead to illuminate this period. Because of this choice, we actually learn more about Queen Elizabeth and her family. The tragedy of Diana's death makes everything seem a little amplified, as though they are experiencing things they would normally experience over the course of a couple of years. Throughout, as we watch them deal with their traditions, and each other, we learn a lot about the traditions of their family, and the history.<br /><br />Shortly after we meet the Queen and her new Prime Minister, the film abruptly shifts to the night of Diana's death. We watch as various images pop up, giving us an accurate feeling of what that night was like. Because Frears uses a quick series of images, we do some of the work, filling in the blanks with our imagination. It is an effective trick and works well to give us information and to keep the film moving along.<br /><br />Throughout the film, the focus shifts back and forth from the Queen and the Windsors, to Blair, his staff and his wife. We quickly realize that Blair is trying to get through to the Queen for a number of reasons. The most important is that he genuinely feels the public needs to hear from her. But the political cache of getting the Queen to change her ways is not lost upon the young Labour official. When this eventually happens, a small smile crosses his lips. His wife is also incredulous about why he would care so much about the Queen. He notes that without her, he would not be possible, so it is in his best interest to help her maintain an air of dignity. I bring this up because it shows Frears is also interested in showing the politics of England at this time, and how all of these events affect one another.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" is a great film, much more sprightly, interesting and human that the traditional biopic.

0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins is a genius. He totally shows how irrational and harmful religion is. I was surprised by the fact he didn't realize how bad things are in the US - he thought Anne Coulter was a parody for example. Still, this book was very well thoght out and well written.
0060887303|1.0|Poorly written and totally inappropriate.   <br /> <br />Most books have a message, or an underlying theme.  The theme of Pretty Little Liars is that you can do whatever you want and get away with it.  There are no repercussions for bad behavior.  In this book, the main characters steal and wreck a car, shoplift expensive jewelry, go after a sister's boyfriend just to make her mad, and on and on.  All without consequences. <br /> <br />I don't mind characters that make mistakes and learn from them, but that never happens in this book, the main characters--four spoiled teenaged girls--go from bad behavior to worse behavior--and someone else cleans up and sets things right.  I kept waiting for the lightning bolt that would make the girls realize they shouldn't be doing what they were doing, but it never happens.   <br /> <br />These girls learn nothing except that they don't have to be responsible for their actions.  Brand names play a major role--everyone is concerned about what they're wearing--or stealing.  Pathetic. <br /> <br />The book never even has an ending, it just sets up the next in the series.  I'd save my money for a book that's well written, and has a positive message.  Try Meg Cabot's books or Dairy Queen.  Leave this on the shelf. <br /> <br />
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I will keep it short and to the point. <br /> <br />1.  This is a very good album <br />2.  No, it is not as good as Fallen <br />3.  It seems to be a little more focused on Amy Lee's voice and just doesn't seem to be the same quality music or lyrics as Fallen <br />4.  This is still a very good album and is worth the purchase, just do not get your hopes up too high.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A lot has already been said about this film, so I'll simply add this: This film is not about being entertained (though most of it is captivating), nor is it about supporting one political party over another (it is unfortunate that this issue has become associated with one political party since it's mostly a scientific matter). This film is about removing reasonable doubt regarding the impact of human activity on global climate. Because of the film, it is now public knowledge that the debate is over: we are warming our planet. Any film that can accomplish such a thing is worthy of respect and applause REGARDLESS of which side of the \\"isle\\" you are on. Everyone should see this film, period. After seeing it if you aren't changed in SOME way then I recommend going to a doctor to check what species you are. Once you are convinced, then feel free to bring politics back into it, i.e. whether to control greenhouse gas emmissions via the market or policy. Either way, we must do something.

B000HCO83Q|3.0|...but it's definitely the weakest of the trilogy. It seems more like a showpiece for the various mutants' powers instead of a somewhat compelling story that was present in the first 2 movies. That said, it's still alot better than most of the other recent superhero movies (that focus largely on 10 year olds with superpowers), but when an X-Men movie is considered to be of equal caliber as The Fantatastic Four (which is a decent action movie with as little story to get in the way as possible), you know you should probably reconsider purchasing said movie without watching it first...

B000050FEN|5.0|I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said. This movie is frightening, extremely suspenseful, revolting, and, above all, undeniably compelling. Fincher is in fine form regarding the direction of this movie, and Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman (one of the best actors of our time), Kevin Spacey, and Gwenyth Paltrow turn in exceptional performances as the main characters. This is easily one of the best films of the 90s, and any true fan of motion pictures should add this collector's edition to their DVD library.
B000E1YVZU|3.0|*** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS *** <br /> <br />I have to admit that, before I saw this movie, I was expecting something much worse than what the movie actually turned out to be. My expectations had been built from reading plot summaries and hearing one or two of the songs plus the lyrics from a few of the others. However, I decided to give the movie a fair chance, as I've been wrong in my expectations before. In the case of Rent, I won't say I was wrong or right. I was kind of half-right in my expectations. <br /> <br />The movie isn't bad, but it is corny, pretentious, pseudo-philosophical, and schmaltzy. It's been said before, but these characters don't come across as people of passion and strong beliefs. They rather come across as excessively idealistic losers who are upset because society makes them do something worthwhile to earn their keep instead of shooting videos of their friends hanging out or spending years writing a single trite song. <br /> <br />Their former friend and now successful businessman is considered a sell-out, though it's not clear what principles he's compromised for money, other than the principle of freeloading. Don't get me wrong - there's plenty wrong with being power-hungry and casting aside people for the sake of profit, but this story hardly captures any of the things that are actually wrong with it. <br /> <br />Along these lines lie pseudo-philosophical statements like \\"We're not gonna pay rent, 'cause everything is rent.\\" I still don't know what that is actually supposed to mean. The best explanation I've heard so far is that it's referring to the fact that you have to pay lots of bills and all that, but if that's what it was intended to mean, it's an incredibly vapid point. <br /> <br />On the subject of the movie's emotional impact, it sounds horrible, but the truth is I was *laughing* during Angel's funeral, and it's not because I found anything particularly funny about Angel's death. That scene could have been one that wasactually moving, but instead they started singing \\"525,600 minutes\\", and the scene suddenly became nothing but corny schmaltz. Unfortunately, the movie is filled with moments like these. <br /> <br />The ending is sad. I don't mean emotionally sad. I mean pathetic sad. Rent tries to tug at heartstrings but then it goes back on its ending as if they were afraid to have a depressing, grim ending and wanted to try *really* hard to have an uplifting ending. <br /> <br />In the end, most of the problems come down to the movie simply trying too hard to be emotionally substantive but being afraid that it won't be uplifting while glorifying a lifestyle that is ultimately unworkable.
B00005JPAD|5.0|In the mold of other gangster films, like 'Scarface' and 'Goodfellas,' Scorsese delivers more than a feather in his ample directing cap with his brilliant new movie, 'The Departed'.  Featuring an all-star cast, 'The Departed' hits the ground and never stops running.  Jack Nicholson is at his ruthless best as the Irish mafia figurehead, Costello.   Menacingly funny, he delivers one of his most unforgettable performances with the steely subtlety that has made him a legend.  Everyone else puts in their brawling best, especially Di Caprio as the tough, but nervous Billy Costigan, an undercover cop pretending to be Costello's prodigy hitman, and Mark Wahlberg as the tough as nails police administrator, Dignam.  And they deliver this masterpiece without needing any help from Joe Pesci or Robert DiNero.  Amazing!        The movie starts us off with the ruthless Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the Italian head of Boston's Irish mafia.  Extorting money anywhere from local greasy spoons to government operations with sensitive weapons' information, Costello makes Don Carleone seem like Mr. Rogers.  We first witness a harrowing extortion scene at a neighborhood Boston restaurant during the sixties.  By sharing the extorted loot with a destitute young neighbor boy, Collin Sullivan, he takes upon him a future prodigy (Matt Damon).  In his pocket at the time of Sullivan's police academy graduation, Costello finds the perfect rat to work undercover in the Boston Police Department.  Sullivan proves to be a savvy informant, brilliantly juggling his responsibilities as a quick, ascending officer, while bailing out the Irish mafia via cell phone.  In the meantime, the police have their own well-disguised rat in Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) who convincingly wins Costello over as another promising hitman.   Costigan finds it hard to stomach all the carnage this organized crime unit masters, and it is to everyone's credit that edgy seems to be a trite description for what Costigan witnesses.   (One particularly unnerving scene is when Costello shows Costigan a severed hand from a victim's body bag.)  How both rats tip-toe through their harrowing treason is one of the masterstrokes of playful suspense throughout this clever flick!  Ironically, police chief Oliver Queenan (Martin Mall) is characteristically clueless like most of the leaders when he says, \\"We deal in deception. We don't deal in self-deception.\\"  There's a lot for both sides to figure out in the film's cat and mouse (rat!) equation.  The resolution of this twisty movie should all but satisfy even the hardest core Mafioso movie fans.       Nicholson is unrelentingly as the silver-tongued devil, Costello.   And DiCaprio gives an inspired performance as the nerve-wracked, beleaguered Costigan.  Damon and Wahlberg have seldom been better as the tough-as-nails cops.  It is brilliant how DiCaprio's and Damon's characters intersect so long without crossing each other's paths.  Their dating interest is for a woman psychiatrist (Kristen Dalton) who brings both men together.  Not only effective as a plot device, it creates a fascinating tension to the movie.  Ironically, the plot is both complicated, yet easy to follow.  Unlike many similar interlocking plot stories, this one is intricate enough to be fascinating, while seldom taxing its audience.  The editing, which nowadays is taken for granted for slick professionalism, is just perfection.  How Scorsese cuts and focuses, then backs up makes frenetic a lame description.  The dialogue is intelligent: menacing, yet quick and witty.  Without spoiling the movie, the film seems to comment on the excess of rats everywhere, and what seems to be implied by the departed is the body of secrets they take with them to their graves. For all its suspense and hijinx, 'The Departed' is probably the most thoroughly entertaining gangster venue since 'Pulp Fiction'.
B00078XGRO|4.0|Ok, it isn't saying much to say that First Contact is one of the best Star Trek movies, but it is nevertheless. <br /> <br />Although it wouldn't be Star Trek without some cheesy lines like \\"You're all astronauts, on some kind of star trek!\\", this movie is saved by the fact that it's got a pretty decent pace with a good amount of action keeping things going. To top it off, you also have the one thing that ever made any Star Trek movie or episode good: a rejection of the notion that humans in the future have evolved so that they are inherently \\"better\\" than people who live today. <br /> <br />Because Captain Picard is a flawed man who is pursuing vengeance for something that was done to him, he is an approachable character who makes morally questionable decisions, and that keeps this movie interesting. <br /> <br />I don't know if a non-Trekkie would find this movie all that great, but I'd guess it's one of only a few that has a chance.
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|For me, of all the live shows that Barbra has done since this special evening, Once Voice stands out as the best. I say this in part because her 1996 Tour, her \\"farewell\\" shows of a few years ago, and her 2006 Tour all have focused on Barbra's more traditional Broadway songs and styling.<br /><br />One Voice blends the best of both worlds, and here we are treated to live readings of some of  Bab's Pop hits as well. Evergreen, The Way We Were, People, all focus on Barbra the Pop Diva. Further 2 songs are featured from her top selling album, Guilty, with Berry Gibb joining her on stage as well. Guilty and What Kind of Fool<br /><br />translate from multi platinum album to a live setting without misssing a beat. She is even backed by a tight group of musicians, as oppposed to a full orchestra.<br /><br />That said, her \\"Broadway\\" songs are allowed to shine even brighter, from the opener of Somewhere, to<br /><br />Send In The Clowns, Somethings Coming, she delivers these gems in a powerfull yet relaxed manner.<br /><br />Over The Rainbow is also featured here, and she pays tribute to one of her idols Judy Garland.<br /><br />Encoring with a beautifully simple rendition of America The Beautifull, Barbra took the celebrity filled audience on a journey through her stellar career.
B000HIVO64|5.0|Beck's newest album (as of 10/06), The Information, is a very unique record.  A blank sleeve with a sticker sheet to \\"make your own cover\\" (which I haven't done and don't intend to) and 15 songs of sprawling variety, this is unlike anything Beck has done so far and perhaps unlike anything anyone is doing at this moment.  This is the record Beck began work on after the brilliant Sea Change before switching gears and recording Guero last year.  The Information was finally finished and released and is just fantastic.  The opening \\"one, two, you know what to do\\" and the drum beat of opener Elevator Music just seem so damn EPIC, and on the whole, the entire album does not disappoint.  It almost seems like a concept album in the vein of Rush, The Who, or Dream Theater in the sense that musical motifs are reused and revisited throughout the entire album.  My favorite songs include the one-two opening punch of Elevator Music and Think I'm In Love, Soldier Jane, Nausea (with its dirty riff), Dark Star (which is stunning), and the Information.  1000 BPM is laugh-out-loud funny in some spots, and the closing 3 song/speech montage Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton is sprawling, dense, cool, and downright bizarre in some parts. <br /> <br />Overall not an album for the faint of heart but an amazing achievement nonetheless.  The album also comes with a DVD containing videos for every song....all for a low price.  Talk about value!
B000J103PC|5.0|My wife and I, huge fans of `America's Next Top Model' and `Project Runway', were very excited about seeing this film.  Why it took us this long still baffles me, but as of Friday night we had the pleasure of seeing `The Devil Wears Prada' and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure.  Now, most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of Meryl Streep, and while she was outstanding, this film is more than just a Meryl painted canvas.  There are four brilliant performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise. <br /> <br />First is Anne Hathaway who plays Andrea Sachs, a young aspiring journalist who takes a job working as Miranda Priestly assistant at `Runway Magazine'.  Anne Hathaway proves with her performance that she's all grown up.  No, that's not to take away from her more adult roles in more adult films like `Havoc' and the masterpiece `Brokeback Mountain', but here Anne proves that she can do adult comedy, not falling back into her teen goofiness that made her famous in `The Princess Diaries' but keeping everything smart and mature.  She has enough poise and grace to match wits with Miranda, and she does so elegantly. <br /> <br />Next up is Emily Blunt who plays Emily, Miranda's first assistant (there are two, Andrea being the second).  Emily has worked her butt off to get to where she is, slaving for the unruly Priestly and it's all about to pay off with a trip alongside Miranda to Paris.  The only thing standing in her way is Andrea, for if Andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly on Emily.  Emily Blunt turns out I think the best performance of the bunch for she has enough sass, enough attitude and enough wit to make her pop out from the screen and stand out no matter who is sharing the screen with her. <br /> <br />Stanley Tucci also does wonderfully here as Nigel, Miranda's second in command.  He is there to make sure everything is perfect, and also help Andrea adjust.  Stanley always has done great backup work, playing second hand man to just about everyone, but here he really makes his performance his own and owns it.  He delivers some of the funniest lines in the film but he never feels like the `token gay guy'...he's needed in this film, not filler, and he commands his scenes and really stands out amidst the crowd. <br /> <br />And then, of course, we have Meryl Streep who plays the ruthless tyrant known as Miranda Priestly.  What I was most impressed about was the way Meryl underplays every word, every emotion, every scene, which is not what I expected.  I really expected her to go all Glen Close and reincarnate Cruella but she didn't (thankfully) and instead turned out one of the most inspired performances of the year.  She must have had fun playing the snooty self absorbed and above all selfish editor-in-chief of `Runway'.  She lets us see inside her character briefly (when crying over another failed marriage) but her character is more about shutting off feeling in order to succeed and so we don't get to see the real Miranda because we're not supposed to. <br /> <br />Carried by these four brilliant performances `The Devil Wears Prada' is a fabulous film that will make you laugh and make you smile and will impress almost anyone.  The script is brilliantly adapted from Lauren Weisberger's novel, and while it's not an exact replica (are any adaptations these days?) it carries the same wit but smoothes things out to make it more approachable and, in my eyes, more enjoyable.  Bravo!
B000GCFO0I|4.0|This movie looks great on DVD. It's crisp and clear, which was one of the problems I had seeing this in the theatre. The images were often muddy and the action hard to see clearly. These problems have been resolved on disc, and I have to say this movie makes for some really nice eye candy. Yes, there are script/plot/pacing problems, but I found myself totally engrossed in all the visuals this time around; Fans of the games(like me...)will get way more milage out this than just horror fans, but there is enough disturbing stuff here to satisfy most. Also, I fast forwarded by every scene with Sean Bean(Nothing personal...he is just totally wasted here...)except for the ones where he is searching in the town and the end. It shortened the movie by about 20 minutes and actually made it flow alot easier. Lots of nice game nods; An ending out of some Hellraiser movie on acid; But it is hard to deny Christophe Gans is a visual genius; I'm sure he'll only continue to get better...
B000A0GP0Y|3.0|I may not be the biggest fan on Adam Sandler but I must admit to being entertained on quite a few occasions by his films.  Now I didn't even want to see this film to tell you the truth but I had free Showtime this weekend so I said \\"what the heck\\" and turned it on.  Into the movie about ten fifteen minutes and I wasn't really impressed.  Adam was pulling his same bad boy persona and the laughs where coming slow and when they came I had to force myself to laugh.  Even after Chris Rock showed up I was a bit letdown since his one-liners were cliché.  But about a half hour in the jokes felt funnier, the chemistry started to click and the film began to pick up.  I was actually impressed by the time the credits began to roll.  So, it's not a brilliant comedy by any means, and it's certainly not Sandler's best but it's a step above mediocrity and a nice diversion from a hectic day.
076531178X|5.0|This is the best fantasy I have read in years. The world and magic system are extremely well-developed, and the story has some great plot twists. But even more importantly, Sanderson's character development is excellent. This is a must-read for fantasy fans, and sets high expectations for the sequels in this trilogy, as well as other future writing by Sanderson, who establishes himself with this book as one of the premier writers in the field.
0786715103|5.0|I just finished reading this book and found it both compelling and haunting.  I couldn't put it down.  If you are looking for a balcony analysis this is not for you but if on the other hand you want to know what it was like... no what it was really like, day to day, and step into the shoes of someone who was there then this is the book for you.  Gen. Dallaire had access to and negotiated over and over again with the top leaders on both sides of the conflict and tells the story, the few triumphs and many failings of the groups in Rwanda, the member nations, and the UN itself, like no one else possibly could.  My hats off to him for taking the time to tell this story, no doubt a painful one, in detail and for having given so much personally during that year of his life to save lives and minimize the deaths in Rwanda with the cards that were dealt him.  Few, I believe would have persisted as long as he did trying to make a difference under similar conditions.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|Honestly other reviews have it right when they say that you should buy yourself an hd dvd player and buy this movie.  It looks amazing, and the sound is out of this world and the the film is very good, to boot.
B000G759LW|5.0|Heartfelt, inspirational, exceptional,amazing, truly amazing. The gift this young woman possess;every single song on the album has depth.  Very few artist are able to offer their fans such a gift. This album has change my view of real music; I now measure music by how this album made me feel.  I was touched by all of these songs.  Thanks Christina for allowing fans a glimpse into your spirit.  If you don't have this album your missing out on something truly special.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Shouldn't be a tough decision. 20/20 had a Special on the 7 most destructive and deadly things facing humanity and Nuclear War was #3 and Virus or Terrorist created Biological attack was #2 and Global Warming was, you guessed it, NUMBER ONE!

Tony Blair has said, \\"Maps are going to have to be redrawn because of what is happening right now\\" due to global warming.

B00005JOQS|3.0|It is a rare occasion when I get this excited about a movie. It seemed as if all the stars were in perfect alignment. I am a HUGE Superman fan, Warner Brothers managed to snag a fine director in Bryan Singer, the reviews coming out were excellent, and I was watching the movie on the finest digital screen in northeast Ohio. Being old enough to have watched the 1977 Superman movie in the theaters, it was all I could do to contain my excitement when the Superman score struck up during the opening credits.<br /><br />Then the first scene started.<br /><br />Unlike Gene Hackman, Kevin Spacey was willing to go with the bald Luthor look but unfortunately the writers decided to continue to portray Lex Luthor as more of a cut rate villain with dreams of grandeur. The movie opens with Luthor stealing the fortune of a dying old woman, a rather non-Luthoresque scheme. The movie Luthor has always been an entirely different animal from what's portrayed in the comics, cartoons and television shows. The comic book version has evolved (and improved) greatly over the last few decades and I was disappointed to see that Spacey's Luthor was the same dated character shown nearly three decades ago. In fact I would argue that his nefarious plan is a near carbon copy of the plan from Superman 1.<br /><br />As the movie continued, my fears about the quality of the script increased.<br /><br />Superman Returns is a sight to behold with gorgeous set designs and spectacular special effects. For the first time ever the REAL Superman was brought to life in live action. Brandon Routh did a fine job taking on the mantel left by Christopher Reeve. The writers didn't dumb down the powers of Superman one iota and most of his arsenal of powers are used (often to spy on coworkers). This is a movie that was lovingly crafted and it's clear that the director had a monumental budget to play with. I cannot stress enough how good the movie looks. Perhaps the most impressive scene is early on when Superman needs to rescue an airliner that's plummeting towards the Earth. The writers were smart enough to realize that despite Superman's immense power it's darn tough to stop that much tonnage without ripping it to pieces.<br /><br />Oh, but the plot. It took Warner Brothers over a decade to come up with THIS? Luthors' plot would have failed REGARDLESS of Superman. It was simply a dumb plan that made his scheme to sink California look like a stroke of genius. It was dumber than Luthors' plan to create a Nuclear Man in Superman 4. The other problem was there wasn't nearly enough Superman action for such a lengthy movie. I was hoping they might slip in another villain like Metallo or The Parasite but nope, just dopey ol' Luther and his ridiculous scheme.<br /><br />When the movie was over the audience actually APPLAUDED and my girlfriend (who couldn't care less about Superman) really enjoyed it. Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe I'm too unforgiving on plot holes but this movie left me very disappointed. I think the reviews have been overly generous which may explain its less than expected gross at the box office. Sadly it pales in comparison to the recent Batman movie but then again just about all superhero movies could learn a lesson in pacing and scripting from Batman Begins.ds to rescue an airliner that's plummeting towards the Earth.

B0006AAS5G|2.0|First of all I would like to mention that the Invicta brand,that exists and produces watches nowadays,has nothing to do with the Swiss company that bears the same name,but went into bankruptcy a few decades ago.The actual Invicta company is an american one and has bought the rights to use this name. <br /> The mechanisms are Swiss made or made in Japan.About the ones made in Switzerland I cannot post an opinion.This particular model(9211),which I purchased this year,has a japanese mechanism(Made by Myota I think).Every 24 hours it loses some precious seconds,so,after a few days it becomes a matter of minutes.In conclusion it has a problem with precision,beeing unable to keep time with accuracy. <br /> I would advise anyone who wants to buy this watch to think twice.Of course the discount price is attractive but the watch doesn't meet it's expectasions;I consider that a \\"minimum\\" dose of accuracy is required.The only good aspect about this watch is it's appearance. <br /> Learn from other's mistakes... <br />
B000084T18|1.0|Another sellout materialistic rapper; spittin dumbass lyrics w/ his annoying azz mumble and clenched teeth.  One of the crappiest albums i've ever heard.  The last 50 Cent album that deserves any props is \\"Guess Who's Back\\" where some of the newer tracks on it are still garbage.  Not to mention 50's a b*tch & a snitch.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|<br />Joaquin Phoenix does a breath taking job at portraying Johnny Cash.  The mannerisms, the facial expression, the way he held his guitar and hunched his head over, while grinning--perfect.  Reese Witherspoon is beautiful as June Carter, and the two of them together constantly steal the show from each other.  It must also be said that both of these actors use their own voices for the songs, and that's saying a lot because the music in this movie is amazing. <br /> <br />The story, the music, the progression of the events is very well done.  One, upon watching the movie, is totally immersed in Mr. Cash's world.  They feel what he feels, see what he sees.  This two hour movie takes us through the past, on an amazing trip in Johnny Cash's shoes as he walks the line. <br /> <br />10/10 Classic.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I am ecstatic about my purchase of this album.  I got it just days after it was released on Oct. 3 and have listened to it 10 times already.  Even after many listens, it is still FAR from boring.  Like \\"Fallen\\", this is another masterpiece and I don't think I will ever get tired of it.  It is haunting, creative, dark, emotional, heavy, melodic, and more.  Amy Lee can add such dimension to a word with her voice, it is phenomenal.  They may have lost a member of the band, but it does not show in any negative way.  This album is every bit as good as \\"Fallen\\".  It is hard to match hits like Going Under, Bring Me To Life, and My Immortal, but overall, \\"The Open Door\\" matches it.  If you liked \\"Fallen\\", you will love \\"The Open Door\\".  Get it new now at the low price found here at Amazon.  I did, and I am VERY satisfied.
0375703764|5.0|This book really shows off what an author can do within the medium of a novel.  It's a fun read that really pulls you and and affects you.  Be sure to get a color version- or at least an edition that has the blue text as intended.
0618680004|1.0|The great success of this book is that it measures religious beliefs by an intellectual standard, thus giving a rationale to all those who feel embarrassed by the failure of some aspects of their religious tradition to co-exist with common sense.    Its great failure is one which outweighs the benefit, even if measured only in numbers of people affected. Dawkins nimbly sidesteps any discussion of evidence for a higher potential consciousness--one able to see through the veil of the physical world--whose examples are the founders of all the main religions. This is ironic, as it would explain the appeal of religions over the ages even over the sense of reason--for an evolutionary urge would always outweigh an intellectual one, even by Darwin's standards alone--and he even omits completely the spiritual harvest of ancient India, including the science of Yoga, established as a series of mental and physical disciplines enabling any individual to verify the truth of religion in their own bodies.    I have seen the massive appeal of religion in Eastern Europe, where it was an outlawed field for three generations. It can only owe its resurgence to an instinctive quality in man, not to any marketing zeal. In the beautifully restored churches, both humble peasants and Gucci-clad young women find an important sustenance when contemplating their spiritual heroes. It is an instinctive quality, and not akin to any intellectual interest, no matter how valid, found among visitors to science museums.    So the most laughable suggestion, amid his fanciful skyhooks and cranes, is that Michelangelo would have produced equally awe-inspiring art had he worked for a scientific establishment instead of a religious one. As regards the spiritual sense in man, a fundamental quality of a human being throughout the ages, Dawkins resembles a blind man examining the Sistine Chapel. The plaster seems to him merely a little flaky to the touch and somewhat rough, even slightly damp or odious.. and adisappointing climax to his long journey. He walks away, shrugging his shoulders at mankind's gullibility.    Oblivious to the lack in his own self, he is no more qualified to write about the spiritual aspirations of mankind than the deaf to write about Mozart, the blind to write about Da Vinci, or a plumber to recommend alterations to St Paul's Cathedral. It is reasonably safe to say that Dawkins will one day be regarded as an amusing curiosity, a product of a materialistic age: a man born without any spiritual aspect, nor much regard for it in others.
B00005MHN9|5.0|I'm really begging with Amazon to not confuse The new Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, with the original Superman II: Richard Lester version because both of these are completely different films & should be treated as such.    1st thing people who truely think that Richard Lester is a great director & did a great job on SII need a reality check. All he did was take an already great script done by SUPERMAN I creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz, and 70-80% shot by Richard Donner shift around some stuff & make the film (all the actors were there for him, a donkey could have done it).    Lester would also add some unneeded slap stick humor (e.g.  Metropolis fight scene where the three super villains use their super breath to blow out the Metropolis civilians where after an unneeded and very cheesey moment of slap stick bad homage to Charlie Chaplin stances take place & the earlier scene of when the supervillains are introduced by duking it out in the American wild west???).    Lester would be found out as a director in the poor Superman III where his slap stick humour would basically ruin the film but not to say his version of Superman II is bad but it just doesn't compare to the brilliance of number 1, especially after repeated watchings II just seems like a poor boys substiute!!    Donner on the other hand had completely different thinking for II it was meant to be on the same epic scale & feeling a I & in quality terms match it if not even better it. Also around 30% of the Lester film uses Donner's footage whilst in the SII:DC it uses around 80% footage & will feel like a completely different film.    Having already seen some of the new scenes, e.g. Lois jumping out of the window of The Daily Planet to proove that Clark is Superman, The fight with The Super Villains over Metropolis, some of the new Brando scenes, & Lois's tearful farewell, it's obvious that this film will be entirely different from the original theatrical realise of SII & should be treated as an entirely different film not put as if it's just a normal directors cut of an already realised film!!!    Please Amazon originally the link was seperate so why change it???

B000HCO8IQ|5.0|Scissor Sisters are so under appreciated it's kinda sickening when you think about it.  All we have anymore are a bunch of cookie cut outs of what big record exec's think will be hits anymore.  There's no longer any originality in music.  Finally a group has come along making music fun again.  Not to say that they're not guilty of covering a few songs themselves(their 1st big hit \\"Comfotably Numb\\" for one) but they're all so original sounding & re-energized that they're all well worth another spin.  I loved both their \\"Demo Album\\"(more electroey stuff with a couple tracks from their debut) & their self titled debut(so much so, I bought it twice just to get the bonus UK tracks \\"Skins\\" & \\"Get It, Get It\\"), and have been feverishly awaiting some new material.  \\"Ta-Dah!\\" is by far at least on par with if not surpassing their 1st album.  \\"Ta-Dah!\\" brings more of the same that we've all grown to love about them but still takes  their sound to another whole new level.  I understand that their style is far beyond the dumbed down music that the American public majority listens to.  It's just kinda embarassing though knowing that this talented group of people had to go over seas to be recognized as the pioneers that they truely are.<br /><br />As far as their issue with \\"FYE\\" it's refreshing to know that at least someone in the music industry realises that $[...] is too much for a brand new CD.  FYE claims they don't sell CDs for that price.  I bought Scissor Sisters debut at FYE for $[...] (sorry $[...]).  I know they're not carrying \\"Ta-Dah!\\" at FYE because of \\"SS\\" speaking publicly about this & you know what, that's okay.  With prices like that (just like \\"Music Land/Sam Goody\\"), their flee market of a store won't be around much longer anyway & I say good ridance.  And people wonder why people are downloading music for free.  Big studio's are producing crap CDs with 1(maybe 2)good song per album for .35c then charging $[..].  Hmmmmm, I wonder, I can't see why anyone would download free music.  Anyway, buy \\"Ta-Dah!\\", it's the best rock/pop album in a long time.free music.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Being a dedicated hip hop head, I always make time for Tool and I've been with them since \\"Ænima\\". I don't see what the big fuss amongst some longtime Tool fans when they say that \\"10,000 Days\\" isn't as good as \\"Lateralus\\". The only main difference I would that exists between the two aforementioned albums is that \\"10,000 Days\\" is slightly less heavy than \\"Lateralus\\". Other than that, writing a review on Tool (for me) is a futile effort. Getting anything from Tool is a lot like doing calculus: you have to do the math to understand it, and with Tool, the music has to be heard/experienced - words won't do it justice. You can pop it in the CD player and literally let it ride; there's nothing to skip - trust me on that.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|This DVD is an amazing trip into my past, its a rock legend at the height of his power. I was in awe and had tears in my eyes for every stunning moment of this concert. The sound quality remix for 1977 is what could be qualified as some of the best I have ever heard. The video was grainy but at least the camera work was well done, I was not expecting much being that it was before the huge innovations in video and flim came onto the scene. Every fan of Blackmore's must own this DVD, it's a steal at $9.99. Dio was incredible in his vocals. This was by far the best Rainbow line up. I saw then in Chicago at the International Ampitheater. This DVD reminded of what a life changing event that had been. The late Great Cozy Powell bangs out some of the hottest drums of all time. I will never forget my time under the Rainbow. this DVD brought it all back like it was yesterday.  29 years in flash, life is short don't let this DVD pass you by.
B000HT386M|5.0|I have never really paid attention to reviews or anything of that sort. I decided to give Click a try and I can say, I am extremely satisfied with this film. I'm really not a big fan of Adams films, theres a few but not many. I thought this movie was going to be a generic childish comedy but I was far off. It started out as a retarded sence of humor but still funny. As the story progressed, you get more and more rapped up in the charcters and storyline. If anything, I would call this film a dark comedy hence it really does jerk tears. I suggest renting this if you liked Punch drunk love. Also, if you liked Donny Darko and the film that ripped it off, butterfly effect, im sure you'll like click. Plus some great cameos from Grandmas boy and in the deleted scenes, Shawn Hunter(boy meets world)s dads in the film. How great is that!
B000GY729M|2.0|What made `Hot Fuss' so infectiously giddily brilliant was Flowers' incessant insertion of his tongue in his cheek - the main bodily movement absent here - and his gift of deft, imitative melody; sure you heard 'em all before, but not with such intense playfulness.  While I rejoice in the band aiming for something other than 'Hot Fuss 2\\", still, this is so joyless, so meandering, so bombastically serious in all it's naked clich&eacute;'s that his proclivity for a Springsteen hierarchy remains un-accessed - 'Sam's Town' is to 'Born to Run' what 'New Jersey' was to 'Born In The USA', only forget the Springsteen correlation - this is analogous to  Jim Steinman rediscovering Freddie Mercury's back catalogue, sort of a `Bat Out of the Opera'. A grandiose gesture that, on some levels, works.  But, mostly, well, not.<br />Flowers' misguided self-importance does nothing to even elevate this to high-camp, which is what saved `Hot Fuss' from the same fate.  But, still, you have to appreciate a band who, after permeating the airwaves with a capricious retread of 80s new-wave, decides to look into the future by jumping further into the past.  Welcome to Prog-Pop.  My grade:  C+
0060776757|5.0|I can't express enough how GLAD I am to own this book. The photographs are exceptional and personal, and the band members open and up front about their (very) humble beginnings, all the way to stardom... which doesn't impress them much. It is the perfect Time for this book. The Band's willingness to put together this volume is a gift to the millions of us who have been touched by the greatest rock band in all the history of rock 'n' roll.
B000GG4KTU|2.0|A `Great American Songbook' sojourner for years, but signifying just exactly what? Tedium? By choosing predominantly 'happy' songs, Krall treads dangerous ground by eschewing her forte - usually slow-paced dirges, sung in a husky monotone.  By juicing up the ante, she could bear responsibility for a backlash.  But her fan base need not worry.  While she's discovered reasons to be joyful these past few years [e.g. marriage to Elvis Costello, pregnancy] Krall couldn't sound more blas&eacute;; while her piano skills remain plucky and skillful, her gloomy phrasing continues to mope until her droopy delivery cures your aching insomnia.  My grade:  B- [although it should be Zzzzzzzzz].
B000002H33|5.0|this album ties with \\"...And Justice For All\\" as my favorite Metallica album.     BATTERY- great opening track. starts out on a deceptively soft note until it explodes into a guitar riff that u cant help but bang your head to. the 2nd heaviest song on MOP.    MASTER OF PUPPETS- my favorite song on here. this 8 min. long song has everything in it. starts out heavy, goes to a softer bridge, then explodes again to its finally.    THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE- whenever i listen to this song, i think of Godzilla for some reason. this is a great song thats really heavy.    WELCOME HOME (SANITARIUM)- a slower song about an inmate in an assylum who wants to escape. the riff for the chorus is amazing.    DISPOSABLE HEROES- another 8 minute song, this one dealing with a soldier who is being used as a killing machine \\"bred to kill, not to care\\", basically being thrown away.    LEPER MESSIAH- a killer song about preachers taking your money for a good seat up There.     ORION- my favorite instrumental from metallica. i think the first part of this song couldve been used on the game \\"Doom\\". Cliff (RIP) does a tremendous job on here.     DAMAGE INC- starts out slow, but then before you know what hit you, it comes to life. this is by far the heaviest and fastest song on the album. this is my second favorite song.     overall, a stupendous job by Metallica. if you are a metallica or any kind of metal fan, I recommend you buy this, or at least borrow it from a friend. the point is-LISTEN TO IT. you wont be dissapointed.
B000H7JD4K|4.0|Iron Maiden deliver their best album since \\"Seventh Son!\\" While they still need to fire Janick Gers, they still sounds amazing.  Strongly recommended!
B000002H97|5.0|this was my first metallica album, and i loved it and i still do. i can see where its different from thier previous work, but its still enjoyable. standout tracks on here are \\"Enter Sandman\\"(of course), \\"Sad But True\\", \\"The God That Failed\\", and \\"My Friend of Misery\\". The only track i dont like on here is \\"The Struggle Within\\". i dont like how James sounds on this song.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|Thank You for Smoking!  Reality or fiction? Whether you realize it or not, we are constantly bombarded with messages about what is cool, or hip, or deadly, or immoral.<br /><br />This is a fictionalized account of one such battle:  smoking tobacco.  When the evidence is so clear that smoking harms both the smoker and others inhaling the smoke, why is smoking tobacco still legal?  It is because there is a cadre of professionals whose job it is to make sure we hear and absorb certain messages, like the government wants smokers to die so that agencies can get larger budgets, while tobacco companies want smokers to live because smokers are their best customers (example taken from the movie)!<br /><br />This film is very entertaining, with a number of great, great actors.  Rated PG-13, and highly recommended.  I give this film 4 stars instead of 5 because the sex scenes (admittedly limited) and language will keep younger children from seeing this film... and I'd like to see more people, not less, view this film.
B000GY729M|3.0|When I first heard The Killers were coming out with a new album I was so excited with anticipation. Having been a huge fan of their previous album and telling everyone how great they are, I have to say i am mildly disappointed with their follow up, \\"Sams Town.\\" Don't get me wrong, there are some good tracks on here, most notably Sams Town, When You Were Young, Bling (Confessions Of A King), For Reasons Unknow, Read My Mind and Bones. Out of the tracks I just mentioned, I would probably give them a 3.5 to 4 rating. The other tracks on here maybe deserve a 3, and some of them seem like filler tracks to me which i cannot say about any of the songs on Hot Fuss (Limited Edition). This album fails to capture a mood and energetic quality as Hot Fuss did. The songs on Hot Fuss had such an upbeat almost dance quality to it, whereas this album has a darker more droned out feel to it. If you like depressing sounding music you may like this album more than I do. A lot of songs on this album are very slow, which you will be disappointed with if you enjoyed the uptempo beats of the last album. Another thing i was disappointed with is how the synthesizers have taken a back seat to the guitar. If you liked the syntesized riffs on Hot Fuss i'm afraid you'll be disappointed when you don't find that here. This is an average album from an above average band, hopefully their next release will have more snythesizers as Hot Fuss did.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I must've been about 10 when I first saw the Lion King and I was practically floored. Those catchy-for-their-own-good songs, the animation(well, me now talking) and that wildebeast stampede. The other one is Beauty and the Beast which for the life of me I can't remember seeing when I was young yet loved every minute of it. Revisiting it now I still love it and on one hand seeing it as a landmark in Disney's catalogue but also one in a series of films that marked a brief creative comeback. <br /> <br />Belle is a beautiful bookworm girl living in a small village. Nose deep in books while having a kooky inventor for a father, many find her odd. However, she does attract the attention of seriously full of himself Gaston, a hunter who can probably single-handedly take women back a few hundred years. Meanwhile, in a distant castle, a Beast lurks; transformed because of a spell unless he gets true love before a magical rose loses its last petal. Eventually these 2 will meet but can they fall in love? <br /> <br />After a decidedly less than perfect 80's period, the Little Mermaid brought the House of Mouse back and showed they can still pull it off. Then came this which was extremely successful and even garnered a Best Picture nod, the only animated film to do so. Also it's one of the few it seems that seems entirely built on a love story and character development. Unlike Ariel who instantly fell in love just by looking at the guy, Belle in fact hates him then grows to love him. This focus allows the film a different atmosphere than others. <br /> <br />The one problem, a really minor nitpick, is that the songs aren't as fantastic. Yes we have Be Our Guest or the hilarious Gaston but I'm not the biggest fan of There May Be Something...and Angela Lansbury's rendition of the title track ruins what's a great cinematic moment. I do have a particular liking for the opening track Belle though. Where the film also excels is the animation. Certain scenes aren't as eye-popping butthe opening title has a beautiful background, Belle is a gorgeous design and Beast is a great animated character. <br /> <br />Thanks to Disney, the film has been put back into the Vault so you can't find it now unless you're willing to drain your paycheck on Ebay. If you can even find it, it's definately worth a recommendation.
B000I0QK74|4.0|This is essentially the same Christmas CD Hallmark released in 2004--James Taylor-A Christmas Album.  The only difference is that  the song, \\"River\\" is included.  The 2004 album may be hard to find.  Therefore, this release would make a welcomed  addition to your Christmas collection.  Nice picture of James, too.
B000E6GBV2|1.0|This is boring faceless alt country indie rock. These guys have less outlaw cred than John Kerry at a 1000 dollar a plate dinner. Normally I don't knock bands for doing their own thing, but here the affectation is too much.\\"when we leave this place and drive back to carolinaand down to savannah and <br />stay..\\" yeah right. Friggin Seattlites. Maybe drive down to Olympia to get some chai tea. It strikes me how if any band musters up a few country chords, and wear trucker hats they will get a decent review on pitchfork. <br />Rant over.
B00004S6GL|5.0|I would agree with Patrick Burnett's comments from 5 years ago. I recently ended a relationship and Elliott has been on repeat since the summer.  His music fits perfectly with those moments where you feel like there is nothing left.  But in a way, the beauty behind his music lifts your spirit like nothing else. \\"Everything Means Nothing To Me\\" was the first song I ever heard from Elliott just last year and it is a small portion of the brilliance found throughout this whole album.   <br /> <br />The acoustically amazing \\"Somebody I Used to Know\\" and \\"I Better Be Quiet Now\\", the very Beatlesque \\"Pretty Mary K\\" and \\"Happiness\\" are just a few of the standouts in my mind. \\"Bye\\" is such a haunting album-ender that gives me chills everytime I hear the echo of the piano. <br /> <br />\\"Figure 8\\" has such a wide variety of sound that only a musical genius like Elliott Smith could create.  His soft angelic voice along with beautiful melodies make this an album that will forever be labeled \\"perfection\\" in my mind. Rest in peace Elliott, your spirit lives on.
B0006399FS|5.0|I have been a fan of U2 since they released their mega-hit record \\"the Joshua Tree\\" ...and since the first time I heard it, I have been a fan of them ever since... AND HAVE NEVER, EVER STOPPED BEING A FAN!!!!! So many people have critisized them because of the many paths they've taken, the risks, the changes, the experiments, but each and every single one of those steps has made them who they are right now: the most honest, bold, charismatic, energetic and emotionally commited band of the modern rock scene.  <br /> <br />They are not a name, a brand, an empty shell: THEY ARE SOUL!!! And I think that this record cleary serves as an example of what they are able to communicate to millions around the world trascending the barriers of language, culture, religion or economic status... HTDAAB is an album that takes time...it's not easily absorbed just by playing it once...which is perhaps what makes it so endering and deep... it's an album that speaks in the flow of the lyrics, echoed by the rhythms and the unmistakable touch that Bono, the Edge, Adam and Larry use to sign every track...They have not lost the boldness and fierce lyrics of WAR or THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE, but rather, they've chanelled them using different elements for both their sound and their lyrics... <br /> <br />I have heard so many \\"so called\\" fans who rip their robes saying how much the band has \\"evolved\\" but...THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MUSIC IS ABOUT..if it is produced for the right reasons...music, TRUE MUSIC, is only created by being born as part of the musician's very core, thus growing and changing with him, not by being manifactured as an easily consumed product like so many bands or pseudo pop stars have diluded themselves into thinking...I'm HAPPY, GLAD, THRILLED U2 has evolved and has had the guts NOT TO REPEAT THEMSELVES...all these \\"fans\\" keep on pressing for the band to come up with an ACHTUNG BABY part 2 or THE JOSHUA TREE volume 2 but what they don't realize is that such is not possible because that time has passed, the 4 people who created those records have matured and are the MAGNIFICENT, CONFIDENT, DARING, STILL POLICALLY ACTIVE BAND we can enjoy today, without being a mere caricature of what they were back then... <br /> <br />so I ask all of those who have only critized them for what they are not, HAVE YOU ACTUALLY TAKEN THE TIME TO LISTEN, REALLY LISTEN TO THIS RECORD????!!!!! I really still find it hard to understand why it would be considered as lacking or weak after hearing tracks like \\"Sometimes you can't make it on your own\\", \\"A Man and A Woman\\" or \\"Yahweh\\"...not only do they capture the inner experiences of their members, but also serve as a way to communicate just what the band has gone through and continues to experience as an entity who has lasted longer than many marriages nowadays...28 YEARS TO BE EXACT since their first sessions inside Larry's kitchen back in their home town of Dublin...  <br /> <br />To not be affected by this record is to be either, in my opinion, close-minded about the possibilites of what A TRUE ROCK BAND SHOULD BE ABOUT or more importantly, to the creativity of these 4 individuals...This record is not about what the fans think of the band, but what the band thinks of themselves and the world they live in...Not political enough? How about \\"Love and Peace\\" or the \\"Miracle Drug\\"??? If someone is not capable to be touched by these two anthems calling attention to the state of chaos and indifference we live in nowadays, I really don't think they should even try to call themselves a fan of this band because then they don't REALLY understand what U2 is about.  <br /> <br />It's a very well balanced album, with tracks that highlight the magical guitar ability of the Edge like \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" or \\"Crums from your Table\\" and expose the perfect harmony between Adam's base and Larry's powerful drums... If it weren't for the fact that Bono, and even the Edge, have mastered lyric composition to such a rich point, the sound the band produces would almost be in danger of overpowering the words...but such is not the case, on the contrary, the lines come at the perfect time, each one entwined with other, like it happens with the second verse in \\"A Man and A Woman\\": ...But you can't be numb for love, the only pain is to feel nothing at all, how can I hurt when I'm holding you\\"....or by the end of \\"Original of the Species\\": ...\\"And you'll never be alone...Come on now, show your soul, You've been keeping your love under control\\"...or in \\"One Step Closer\\":...\\"I'm on an island at a busy intersection, I can't go forward, I can't turn back...\\"  <br /> <br />If you are someone new to their sound, spend time with the CD and REALLY pay attention to the lyrics...view them more as a dialogue between you and them rather than a speech they are trying to deliver...and immerse yourself in the sound completely. If you are a long time fan then I'm sure that whatever I've written somehow echoes your own opinion...and if you still continue to feel like this record is not what U2 \\"used to be\\" well...it's your loss...thank goodness is not ours :D
B0002SROT0|5.0|Originally envisioned as Elliott's interpretation of the Beatles' White Album, From A Basement On the Hill transformed into (what I believe to be) Elliott's defining work. An unfortunately unfinished symphony, it still manages to become a quintessential piece of music history.<br /><br />For some time, Elliott dealt with the insecurities that accompany most musicians pouring themselves into their work: criticism, soaring popularity, Kurt Cobain syndrome - all were factors of Elliott's uncomfortable presence in the spotlight. Throughout his early career, he implicitly stated that his songs were not diary entries. As if to prove his point, his songs became increasingly more enigmatic, throughout XO and Figure 8.<br /><br />Basement is Elliott's real inner workings. The album illustrates something new for Elliott, acceptance. He had begun to admit that his sensitivity to friends / relationships was something he would have to learn to deal with. This new narrative is illustrated in songs like A Passing Feeling, Let's Get Lost, and Twilight, songs filled with a sense of letting go - similar to Harrison's All Things Must Pass. Other songs range from criticism of the music industry and Elliott's roles therein (\\"King's Crossing\\" / \\"Strung Out Again\\") to social commentary (\\"A Distorted Reality is Now a Necessity to Be Free\\" \\"The Last Hour\\"). The former, as the last track on the album, punctuates the albums statement poignantly.<br /><br />Like Roman Candle, I don't feel that Elliott had anyone audience in mind when he was creating the album, only a goal: to prove to himself that he could survive.<br /><br />Throughout much of the recording process, Elliott was delving deeper and deeper into ways he could reach into his darkness. He would spend 3-5 days at a time recording each song from start to finish, without a break. It was his way of pushing pasts barriers, digging even deeper than he had ever gone. I believe he was motivated to do so because he believed it was the only way he could survive. For the year prior to the recording of this album, Elliott became increasingly depressive, drugged, medicated, and isolated. He came to the realization that he had to stop using drugs as a way of dealing with his past, and I believe this album was some of the motivation to heal. Although his abuse continued, and even worsened throughout the recording process, by the end of it - he was clean.<br /><br />But aside from the amazing emotional depth, the album was technically inspired as well. Many of the tracks were recorded in the vein of Sgt. Pepper, rock's holy grail of avante garde production. Originally produced and mixed by Elliott and David McConnell, they had intentionally approached the album with an all at once historic and new age feel. Bouncing tracks down from 8 to 1, the sounds became fuller, thicker, more condensed. Elliott and David detuned guitars, ran vocals through amps to mics (ala Tomorrow Never Knows), resulting in what I would consider a sorely underappreciated sound. Elliott was determined to create something that hadn't been heard in decades, he wanted every sound to be unique to the album. He was so determined in fact, that he attempted to erase the masters on several occasions - in order to insure that no one could ever stray from the mixes he had birthed. Specifically to avoid any pitch correction via Pro Tools.<br /><br />Although the album was eventually finished by long time collaborator Rob Schnapf (whose production Elliott had described as \\"too clean\\"), the album maintains a density that amazes the most hard to please ears. It is all at once warm, and desolate - fuller, richer.<br /><br />In the end, the album still feels like a prelude to what was envisioned. The official release ended with just fifteen tracks, a far cry from Elliott's original count of 30. My hope is that somewhere down the road, the family and Interscope will agree to release Basement as it was intended, with the previously cut Stickman, True Love Is A Rose, From A Poison Well, Let's Turn the Record Over, Abused, Almost Over, Suicide Machine, and the other -  as these songs only further elaborate the amazing story that is Basement.<br /><br />Until then, we're left with what will unfortunately be remembered as an incredible artist's last album. I think it's important to mention that in the end, Basement did end up helping Elliott. By the time the album was near completion, he had been clean for some time. He was planning benefit concerts for Clean Needle, and intended for most of the profits from Basement to go towards the Elliott Smith Foundation, established to provide aid to abused children. I think Elliott's death will forever overshadow what a beautiful, honest, innovative, cathartic, and important album Basement truly is. But my hope is that it will only grow to be more appreciated...Stickman, True Love Is A Rose, From A Poison Well, Let's Turn the Record Over, Abused, Almost Over, Suicide Machine, and the other -  as these songs only further elaborate the amazing story that is Basement. <br /> <br />Until then, we're left with what will unfortunately be remembered as an incredible artist's last album.

B000FGGE68|3.0|The Jeff Shannon review is spot on. The entertainment value here is in the visuals. They are very stylish, borrowing from TRON. The idea of having a tightly clad martial-arts babe as the heroin is cribbed from The Matrix. Milla even does an \\"arm-breaker\\" on a security guard in the very first fight sequence as did Trinity in The Matrix, so I guess we can call this an \\"homage\\". Ultraviolet has a rockin music soundtrack that is just so The Matrix that they might as well call it Matrix Re-Recorded. I loved it. It's actually a bit more electronic/techno than The Matrix. Great!<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained about the stylized martial-arts sequences where Violet impossibly lays down a dozen foes at a time. But this is nothing more than an \\"homage\\" (again) to the Bruce Lee films. The choreagraphy is taken straight from those early days in which Bruce Lee was portrayed as a supernatural power. Think of each confrontation where a supremely confident bad-guy (or dozen) thinks he can take Bruce, but after the first exchange of blows the camera reveals the bad-guy's sudden doubt -- that look of \\"holy mother of god, I'm in way over my head\\" -- followed by the grim determination to fight on towards a possible lucky finish. Which never happened of course. Bruce would start to taunt them, the cat playing with its prey, and then Bruce always took out the garbage at the end of the sequence. Same with Violet. The same sense of humor that allows playing out the inevitable in one fight after another is captured in Ultraviolet.<br /><br />It looks like Milla did a lot (certainly not all) of her own stunt work in Ultraviolet. Nice job.<br /><br />By the way, the Hemophages have a couple of new technologies -- \\"flat store\\" which is a form of \\"dimensional compression\\". This allows the wonderful visual effect of storing weapons in impossibly small spaces. The humans have it too, obviously, as in the storage of \\"the weapon\\" at the beginning. And the Hemophages alone have some sort of gravity-modifying tech that enables the wild motercycle-on-the-walls and martial-arts-on-the-ceiling sequences (which are great). Those are not to be attributed to the Hemophage disease which does produce super reflexes and stamina.<br /><br />I just happened to watch this film back-to-back with Aeon Flux as Jeff Shannon discusses. Though Aeon Flux has the more fully realized back-story, I think Ultraviolet is more fun to watch.<br /><br />It's Milla after all. I think she needs to do a film with some major talent that she can react off of, instead of being the center. Pair her up with Sean Connery, or Bruce Willis (again), or Denzel Washington, but in a non-sci-fi action situation. A cop-drama or a CIA intrigue... She's a decent actress who could possibly grow more than people think. Her Joan of Arc portrayel had some good dramatic moments, particularly in the scenes with Dustin Hoffman. She's certainly ahead of the current crop of teeny-bopper brat-pack types.<br /><br />For Milla's best action film so far, get the first Resident Evil installment available at Amazon. See my review here at Amazon.<br /><br />Late addition to this review: I understand that a new Indian Jones movie is in the works, and that Harrison Ford is in, and probably Sean Connery as well. Add Milla as the girl that an aging Jones relies on in action sequences as well as in the romance department. Perfect!h that enables the wild motercycle-on-the-walls and martial-arts-on-the-ceiling sequences (which are great).

B000HWXS2S|5.0|I'd have to say this album pretty much rules, and what not, and stuff.  So if your considering a purchase of the above title, thou shall not go wrong.  It's a glorious epic journey through the viking hinderland.
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|In retrospect this movie was ahead of it's time, loong before \\"Reality\\" shows were a staple of regular TV programming. This movie was a preview of where things could go right or wrong for entertainment.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I'll go song-by-song. <br /> <br />Sweet Sacrifice - I love the FU-type sarcasm in this first song. It's a very powerful and fun song to start the album with. I've heard comments that this album is overproduced, but the overprouductiveness definately works for this song. I think it will probably be one of the singles. <br /> <br />Call Me When You're Sober - This song is very catchy, which is why it was a good first single to start with. Not one of my favorites on the album, but very good nonetheless. <br /> <br />Weight of the World - Another song that could possibly turn into a single. I like it; it's simple, compared to the rest of the album. It's still heavy, though. The lyrics are cool, and the chorus is 100% Fallen-sounding. It's also a very liberating song: \\"I won't be held down by who I used to be/She's nothing to me.\\" I like how it goes acoustic for a moment near the end. <br /> <br />Lithium - This is the confirmed next single, which I think is a smart move. It's the My Immortal of the album, only darker and with more guitars. It's still hauntingly beautiful, though. And annoyingly catchy. <br /> <br />Cloud Nine - The intro freaked me out the first time I heard it, but once I got past that, this is a cool song. It's pretty much like Sweet Sacrifice, except less sarcastic and more sexy-sounding (not that the lyrics are sexy, just the way she sings them). I also think it's interesting how this song sounds like a bunch of different songs put together. <br /> <br />Snow White Queen - About a stalker, and interestingly enough from the point of view of both of them. I really don't like the verses, they sound too mechanical with the vocals and instruments put together. But after that, it rocks, and if this song becomes a single, I'm guessing the phrase \\"You belong to me, my Snow White Queen\\" will catch on as quickly as \\"I'm bringing sexy back\\" has. And I absolutely adore the bridge in this song, she sounds really scared and desperate in it. <br /> <br />Lacrymosa - This song was really built up to be all epic and stuff, espeically after The Open Door trailer came out this summer with a sample of Lacrymosa. Don't get me wrong, the song rocks, but it's not as great as I thought it would be. It's The Open Door's Whisper, and it really doesn't compare (then again, Whisper is my favorite song). Still, I love the orchestra. Not a fan of the choir, but I like the song itself. <br /> <br />Like You - The saddest song on the album, methinks, because it's about Amy's sister who died. This is a beautiful song, and the lyrics just give me chills. A definate highlight of the album. <br /> <br />Lose Control - This is my least favorite song on the album. Which says alot, because I still like the song. It's surprisingly sexy for Evanescence. If you're not into sexy lyrics, it will take awhile for this song to grow on you. It sounds alot like most of the other songs; low vocals, loud guitars, too many background vocals. But, yeah, not a bad song. It even has a Mary Had a Little Lamb reference, as if there hadn't been enough twisted nursery rhymes/fairy tales on this album (note Snow White Queen, and Call Me When You're Sober's Little Red Riding Hood-themed video). <br /> <br />The Only One - My favorite song on the album, no question. To me it sounds Origin-ish, just a lot better. This song is just...wow. Everything about it is amazing. It's powerful, emotional, slow, fast, beautiful. P.S., the intro is something Amy wrote as a joke called Tuna Afternoon. <br /> <br />Your Star - The \\"I can't see your star\\" part annoyed me at first, to the point of my being turned off to the song. But as I look at the lyrics, escpeically in the intro, I really liked it. The chorus is really cool, and so is the background choir. <br /> <br />All That I'm Living For - I'm not crazy about the chorus, but once you get past that, it's a really beautiful song. I love the lyrics. Not the intro so much, though. <br /> <br />Good Enough - Ah, the happy song. Well,happy-ish. Still, it's a beautiful song, even the minute-long piano intro. It's catchy and...well, I don't know what else to say except it's pretty. <br /> <br />The Last Song I'm Wasting On You - FIND THIS SONG ON THE INTERNET IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE IT. IT WILL MAKE YOU CRY, AND IS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN LITHIUM AND GOOD ENOUGH COMBINED.
0743490304|4.0|This is a Dan Brown book but has a feel of a James Patterson book.  It is a typical scandal in politics and as it unravels it is even more scandalous.  I thought it was enjoyable and had some interesting information about space and the ocean that will give you some educational value.  I enjoyed it a lot but wouldn't classify it as a best ever.
B000BT97AO|3.0|I bought the DVD based on the trailor and my extreme fondness for Gaiman and McKean's work on Sandman.  Having revolutionized the comic book medium, I was certain this collaboration would result in a movie that would kill.  While the film is very visually creative, I was disappointed with the writing and this was a shock.  Gaiman's Sandman stands as some of the best fantasy writing in the last century, it deserves mention in the same breath with Tolkien.  Instead, you get a script that is more in The Dark Crystal league, another movie that I thought was visually more compelling than its story. I'm still looking forward to Stardust, the movie currently being filmed from Gaiman's novel of the same name.  I can recommend Mirrormask to fantasy fans based on the wonderful art direction (McKean is an extraordinarily talented artist) and special effects, but don't expect anything remotely as profound as the Sandman or American Gods.
0312323867|5.0|This is suppose to be a follow up of Somthing Borrowed but I actually read this first then Something Borrowed.  I enjoyed this one more and it really didn't matter which order you read them in.  This is a book about the pretty, popular girl, Darcy who has life handed to her on a silver platter.  She never really worked hard for anything and could have any guy she wants, and knows it.  She is engaged to the dream guy but has a fling with one of the groomsmen.  She thinks she will follow through with the wedding but finds out she is pregnant by the groomsmen and then she finds the groom having a fling with her maid of honor.  It is nice to see the brat have egg on her face after a cake life but it takes her a while to be truly humbled.  After Darcy is humbled she starts a new life and learns to forgive.  This book is comparible to Confessions of a Shopaholic.
B000063DGC|5.0|Musicians dying before their time is nothing unique in rock'n'roll history. SRV, Hendrix, Joplin, Holly, Morrison, etc.. However, there was always an innocence attached to Randy Rhoads. Here was a classically trained guitarist that was interested in incorporating brilliant and complex guitar arraingments with popular music. He took an alcohilc and believed to be washed-up rocker like Ozzy and helped him to produce his two greatest works ever. You know, a lot of players sound great in the studio, when they can triple track their recordings, but here, Rhoads shreds in fluid beauty, live and in person. Just incredible playing. The only man that could make Ozzy take a backseat on stage, God Bless him.
B000HT386M|4.0|I see that online here this movie has had mixed reviews. I tend to think that this movie was decent. Although the outcome was very predictable, no suspense or disguise at all, the material in between was entertaining.  Adam sandler plays Michael, a father who has had work become a priority over his family.  The weekend of the fourth of july, Michael gets assigned a huge work project, and decided to cancel his families planned fourth of july camping trip to work.  During the course of that evening, he gets frustrated with all of his remotes trying to watch a video for work, and set of to find a Universal remote. Being late, the only store that happened to be open was Bed,Bath, and Beyond.  Well, little did he know he would be involve in discovering just what \\"beyond\\" stands for.  Christopher Walken plays the store attendant that helps him get his remote, which turns out to be a remote to control his universe.  From their, the movie takes off as we see him trying to control his universe.  Beware though, the remote will \\"auto progrom\\" , and he gets his life turined upside down once the remote learns his habits.   <br />Yes the ending was predictable, and I am left to wonder why he just didn't reprogram the remote, IE change his habits or pust some of the other buttons, but the movie is what it is. At least rent this one, but I say it is a good one for the collection.
B000GY729M|5.0|...Then you will like this album. I'm the type of listener who got goose-bumps at \\"All These Things I Have Done\\", and although \\"Sam's Town\\" doesn't have a lead track as chilling as it, it still measures up. When I got the album, I heard it from start to end three times in a row. I can usually only listen to an album once, before I need to hear something else, but \\"Sam's Town\\" did the trick. The Killers use their countless inspiration sources from the 80's to full effect, the keyboards/synth is amazing. <br />A really good album, I can recommend it 100 percent!
B0000640VO|5.0|Guys put this one in your shopping basket for next valentine's day or your girlfriends birthday, she will love it. I do not know a single female who does not like this movie and you will even enjoy it yourselves. It is FUN, the best way I can describe it. There is not much else to say about this movie, it has no faults, as long as sub-titles don't bother you.
0440241413|5.0|Confessions of a Shopaholic is an awesome book. After you read the first few pages you will not want to put this book down...or any of her other books for that matter. After I read this book I did not want to stop reading it! I wanted to go and buy all the books and just read those instead of other books! I defintely recommend you read Sophie's books and you will become a Shopaholic yourself. Enjoy!!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I got the album about a month before it came out, I just had to listen to it, I couldnt wait. So I first listened to it on the subway to work, and I was kinda dissapointed in the first listen. Then I was like, you know what I'll give it a try later on. The more I listened to it, the more I loved it. This album is crazy!!!!!!! I did buy the album also,  It is going to be the best of 2006, it's also one of the best albums I heard in a while... I had my ipod on shuffle songs because there were no new good albums to listen to... My fav. song right off da back was Lithum and it still is... then its, Like you, Snow White Queen, Lacrymosa and Your Star... those are my favorites but I love the CD from Start to Finish, a Must get!! That sucks that I cant see them on tour so I'm hopin they come out with a DVD... True Fans of Evanescence and good music will appreciate it. The album is more darker, it has a better meaning and all the songs relate to the title, \\"The Open Door\\" if you understand the album for what it is... The lyrics are awesome, so is the music... like I said... Masterpiece!!
B000GPIPVU|3.0|I loved RL`s first cd , Trouble , I was seriously excited awaiting his new disc. What a major disappointment . The songs themselves are not as strong as the first effort , and the completely over-wrought production on many of the tunes made at least half of this cd cringe-worthy. You don`t mix the strings equal or louder than the vocals . RL`s softer vocal delivery on this disc is not in any way enhanced by the production values chosen. I think that anyone would agree that a voice like RL`s is so unique that less is certainly more , and he doesn`t need to flounder around in the mess that half of this cd is.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|While the movie may have its flaws, it succeeds well as a time-twisting tale of star-crossed lovers. While the superb Bruce Willis movie 12 Monkeys was more powerful and dramatic in the way it explored temporal paradoxes, The Lake House still manages to achieve the same spine-tingly feel at all of its peak moments. <br /> <br />To me, the story is allegorical, in that we are all star-crossed lovers, and that we are constantly at the effect of time and destiny, of missed opportunities and beautiful moments of convergence. <br /> <br />While the mailbox acts as a time portal for their communications, our subconscious minds, our collective sixth sense, can act the same way, if we could just be still and learn to listen to our hearts. <br /> <br />A sweet movie, and a very intelligent 'love will find a way' feel-good movie. Not too many of those around.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I would recommend to all the fantastic (and all theatres of WW2 covered) dvd boxset of World at War,from the BBC and Amazon.It remains the foremost.Two other documentries \\"The nazis,a warning from history\\" and \\"Auschwitz\\",both from the BBC and written by Laurence Rees would compliment this series as they look in depth at the Nazi \\"Final solution\\" and Life in Nazi Germany and should be bought alongside the massive WW2 set narrated by the late,great Laurence De Olivier  who loans the series so much pathos and gravity and accompanied by archive footage,actual interviews from survivors,soldiers,etc of the time.The music too is haunting and it has stayed with me for years.What an amazing set.<br />  Its worth every penny/cent.If you  are going to invest in one war documentry-let this be it.Its an investment.You cant put a price on Knowledge.
B00006EXCC|5.0|If you like the Stones when they were just breaking into the scene and really making a name for themselves then this is a perfect cd to own.<br /><br />The only drawback is Lady Jane.  It just isn't a very good song.  Maybe it worked for the swinging London crowd of the late 60's but not today.<br /><br />Everything else is outstanding.
B000000OF6|5.0|When queen was in their prime, I was a young child. I do have memories of hearing some of their more popular songs on the radio. Under Pressure and Another one Bites The Dust for example, are songs I heard over and over again. Now that im a bit older, I appreciate this bands musical contributions even more. Most of the songs on disc 2 seem to be 80's trash. Their 70's material in my opinion is just light years better then their 80's stuff. Although I will say that I think \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\" is an exception. I first heard this song while watching Highlander in 1985. That and \\"Under Pressure\\" are definitely the gems of disc 2.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|This album might even top ATR's \\"This Darkened Heart\\" and it certainly covers more way more ground.  One of my favorite albums already and its only been out a few months!  BUY IT TODAY, DONT WAIT ANY LONGER!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|When this movie showed up on a movie channel, I almost skipped it, but I am so glad that I didn't! I enjoyed the characters so much, including the insane little seeing eye b*tch! There were so many feelings involved. The film was funny, a little crazy, touching, sad, and very, very moving. I loved getting to know the Russian or Ukrainian people and their culture; the old as well as the new.  <br />  Alex is so charming and funny at the same time, with his ideas of hip hop and the American culture; and wisdom that seems beyond his years. Elijah Wood was wonderful as the eccentric little American Jew named Jonathan who seemed very meek and a little bumbling (he had a phobia of dogs and almost couldn't get into the car with one), but he was amazingly brave to go on his quest in a country he knew nothing about to find the woman who helped his grandfather escape from the Nazis in WWII. Alex's grandfather, who insisted that he was blind, yet he drove the tour car that they all rode in, was such a character; a combination of harsh from the years of hardship he'd had in his life, and yet with a soft tender side underneath that showed up every once in a while. <br />  The Russian songs throughout the movie were perfect and pulled you right into the story. The scenery was amazing. It all made me want to visit Ukraine. If you haven't watched this movie, do it!
0553579908|5.0|It is difficult to offer this series praise that hasn't already been offered. I'd have never thought that the author could actually produce a sequel that was better than the first, but he just may have done it here. The book is structured so that within the main story, there are a large number of other stories, each reliant upon a specific character. What the book amounts to is a collection of stories about a large cast of specific and very deeply developed characters that, when taken as a whole, begin to paint a picture of the larger \\"story-behind-the-story.\\" Each individual chapter of the book rises into climax and resolution, giving it the feel of constant action and tension, while continuously setting up future conflicts. The main story doesn't resolve, and in fact deepens just as the book concludes, paving the way for what promises to be an explosive third volume. I'll wrap up with a few comments to respond to some of the reviews I read before starting this book:  <br /> <br />1. There is a good bit of sex, and some profanity, but only as seems necessary to establish traits and personalities of the main characters. Although at times graphic, these parts are not drawn out or dwelt upon and are not typically made to be focal points of the story. They are accessories for the sake of characterization, doing their job well, driving the reader to deeper love/hate of the character involved.  <br /> <br />2. Anyone who says that the plots don't resolve doesn't understand the structure of the book. This isn't one story. It is many that are interwoven.  <br /> <br />3. There are indeed ALOT of major characters, and at first it seems daunting to try to get to know them all and keep track of who is doing what. Trust me when I say this resolves very quickly as you get to know the characters and their houses and involve yourself with their lives. This is what makes this book rich. It is a depth I've not seen in any other novel or series I've read.  <br /> <br />4. The book leaves much to interpretation. Being character driven, you will love some characters, and you will hate some. The beauty is that, much as in real life, the choices are left up to you. There is no real \\"good guy/bad guy\\" here. I find that within the same houses there are family members that I truly love, and those that so anger me I can almost experience them tangibly.  <br /> <br />This volume fulfills the promise of the first and leaves the reader waiting in anticipation to read the third.  Compared to the first book, many more of the traditional \\"fantasy\\" elements are introduced, including dragons, sorcery and prophecy, but in a notably low-key manner that contributes to the story, without becoming the story.  This series is just beautifully written.  I'll say again: Thus far two of the best books I've ever read.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|Definately some of Mike Patton's best work this side of Epic.  I highly recommend this CD to those that like mixed work CD's and explorations of technique and electronica.  For the price this CD really can't be beat.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's basically a movie about 3 kids who grew up together only one was emotionally scarred for life as a child. As they grow up they all go their seperate ways until another horrific event brings them all together again for one more sad, unsettling experience together. Does anyone grow or learn anything? No. Do the \\"bad guys\\" pay? No. It is difficult for me to say just how much this movie sucks without giving away the ending. Suffice to say that no one wins, innocent people get screwed over, and in the end - no one really learns anything. It's a thoroughly depressing movie with no point - unless the point is that life sucks. As if viewers don't have enough of their own problems, or as if real life isn't traumatizing enough - we are subjected to this horrible 2 1/2 hours of misery. I am not exaggerating - there is no redeeming value to this movie. Sure the acting is great, but what good is it with such a tragic story. And this is not like a Greek Tragedy or Shakespeare Tragedy - there are no heroes, no lessons to be learned, no moral to the story - it just makes you feel miserable and hollow and then nothing - just the credits rolling. This movie is so terrible that I would rather watch \\"Kazaam\\" than watch this again.
B000HT386M|3.0|Click is a about a hard working man who's too busy trying to get a raise that he forgets that his family matters the most. When he gets a remote control that lets him control his life and everything around him he still doesn't realize that his family is what matters the most. He fast forwards his life at home so much that the remote automatically gets used to fast forwarding through his home life. Which finally starts to teach him a lesson. When he finally learned I was depressed but still managed to find the ending a little touching.<br /><br />  Sandler may be a family man here but I didn't feel bad for his kids that he was hardly around. He's the same Adam Sandler that he is in all his comedies. He's an immature jerk that bullies people....even the kid next door. So okay Adam Sandler never made a movie where he can do whatever he wants with a remote control. But he made about 15 or 20 movies where he's a loud mouth jerk.<br /><br />  Sure he learns here not to take life for granted but does Sandler's characters in his movies ever actually learn to grow-up. I mean here he picks on the kid nextdoor and then has a scene where he actually says his son should grow-up ?? I mean look at his example...lol. I'm not one of those guys that worships Sandler's comic talents because I don't see where he has that much. He just gets laughs by picking on people and yelling his way through every comedy he does and needs new material already. All he knows is how to do violent or mean humor.<br /><br />  Now the good things about the movie...1.) Kate Beckinsale is sooo hot but the movie doesn't show her enough. When she's shown, she just gets fast forwarded so we get more Adam Sandler and less Kate Beckinsale. 2.) David Hasselhoff is actually pretty good as Sandler's boss and has shown of late that he's pretty reliable to be funny in comedies these days. 3.) since I like fantasies with It's a Wonderful Life type stories I found the movie fun at first. Then it gets a little too sad and even has Sandler crying, which he doesn't do that convincingly. So I had mixed feelings for the movie but I can't say the end didn't move me or almost make me cry. The movie teaches you not to take life for granted but doesn't teach Sandler not to be type casted as an immature jerk.nd even has Sandler crying, which he doesn't do that convincingly. So I had mixed feelings for the movie but I can't say the end didn't move me or almost make me cry. The movie teaches you not to take life for granted but doesn't teach Sandler not to be type casted as an immature jerk.
B000GRUS22|4.0|In the world of Ambient/New Age/whatever music, Enigma is the king. This one is not quite as good as \\"The Screen Behind the Mirror\\" or \\"Le Roi...\\" which I would give 5 stars, but it's at least as good as \\"Voyageur\\" - although quite different. I would say it is more of an instrumental album than previous releases. So if you can appreciate music for simply being enjoyable and different, then you will like this. If you want Enigma to make the same album over and over, then you may not feel this one, but you can always go listen to 1990's Enigma over and over.
0060899190|5.0|I love this book.  I love this project.  I've been a fan of the website for awhile, and am glad many of the postcards have been published in book form.  This is the type of art project that reminds you of the pain and beauty in humanity.  You're also glad that there are other people out there in the world going through some of the same things that you are.  Amazing.
B00007FOMP|5.0|I'm not too familiar with R&B studio albums (other than a couple Stevie Wonder records), but this is the best I've heard so far. The title track was the biggest hit, and justly so - it's one of the man's best songs, everything just falls into place on this one. Marvin's vocals and especially his yearning, pro-peace lyrics especially stand out. I also love Save the Children, him pretty much saying that, although the world is screwed, we should live life for the children. Mercy Mercy Me is a haunting ode to the environment, the first time I heard the choir part at the end it was chilling. Next up is the seven-and-a-half minute Latin-funk Right On, a longer song that's downright captivating, and the most un-Narvin Gaye-sounding song on this album. But he pulls it off, in fact it's one of the best. The album closes out with my favorite Marvin track, Inner City Blues, a haunting pseudo-rap which deals with the bad parts of urban life. There are a couple of other great songs (What's Happening Brother, Flyin' High) on here too, but these are the ones that stand out to me especially. Plus the album has a wonderful flow to it. There's not a bad song here, either!<br /><br />A couple bonus tracks were thrown on: an alternate version of this release: an alternate God Is Love and Sad Tomorrows, an early version of Flyin' High (in the Friendly Sky). This is a must-have in any record collection. It's that simple.
B00005N5S5|4.0|I'm confused. Amazon says this DVD has lots of features, but the box (and the MGM site description of the dvd) state that it only has the trailer and original scripts on it. This is SO DISAPPOINTING! I wanted to see the deleted scene with Reese and Sarah, but I had to resort to youtube to watch it. :p <br /> <br />Kind of sucks when that happens. :(
B000HT386M|5.0|This movie falls in line with \\"family fun\\" which has become an extreme rarity since the mid-1980's.  This movie has nothing crude which you would want to cover your children's eyes when watching.  Most language is reduced to \\"near-cursing\\" rather then using actual words that the FCC cares about.  Additionally, this movie hold the classic principle that movies are to educate as well as entertain.<br /><br />This movie is a spin off the same concept of \\"The Family Man\\" and \\"Bruce Almighty\\".  Similar to Bruce Almighty, Adam Sandler's character gets all the power and freedom he can imagine; this time through a Universal Remote Control.  The moral is similar to \\"The Family Man\\" but not quite the same.  Where The Family Man was about a man who chose his work over his girlfriend and gets a 2nd chance to see what a mistake it was, Sandler's character wants the best for his family but gets caught up with what needs to be done to get there.  Before he realizes it, he put work first under the justification that in the long run the family will appreciate it.<br /><br />Another review said that the moral was \\"family comes first\\" because that is said at the climax of the movie, but that is not actually the moral.  The moral to appreciate what you have now, else you may just loose it.  In Sandler's character's case, he looses his family because he put work before the family so that he could \\"provide for\\" his family.<br /><br />My only theory why this movie did not receive a higher score from other reviewers is the fact that Adam Sandler still is associated to brainless humor movies, such as Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore and Waterboy.  As a result, I feel that other reviewers were expecting something more along those lines.  The humor in this movie is very strong, but it is not the silly and slapstick style which was portrayed in the previously mentioned films.  There is nothing wrong with any of those movies, just a completely different target audience as this movie invites it's viewer to think while being entertained rather than just unwind, stop thinking and enjoy the feature.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Bruce Almighty and Family Man, you will enjoy this movie.  If you are looking for another Happy Gilmore, keep waiting.while being entertained rather than just unwind, stop thinking and enjoy the feature. <br />If you are a fan of Bruce Almighty and Family Man, you will enjoy this movie.

0312995423|2.0|Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with. <br /> <br />I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I :)
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has been on my radar for many years, since they first broke out into the mainstream I guess and even their first major label release was tame compared to their pre-Dookie independent releases but I read several reviews for this release and browsed several forums and I keep seeing a few themes that are quite narrow and frankly disturbing. <br /> <br />First the accusation that Green Day is not a talented group, musically speaking.  Two, they aren't Punk rock and should have no right to call themselves this because they aren't the Sex Pistols as one person wrote.  Three that they are a pop band or rock band.  I wrote this review, my first ever, to praise Green Day's great job on this monumental masterpiece not to trash others but let's be clear on the history of modern music.  Punk Rock was created as a form of anti-social (societal) music with great bands leading the way such as the Pistols, Dead Kennedy's, the Stooges, Velvet Underground and many more.  I grew up listening to a lot of this music.  I also grew up listening to Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix and the only real difference between Punk Rock and Rock was mass appeal and in some cases, talent.  That is Punk rockers were not always the most talented or melodic rockers but many were.  One person compared Good Charlotte to Green Day and is clearly dillusional as they are not a Punk Rock or Rock band, they are simply another teenie band like 'N Sync or Brittney Spears, lets be real about the state of the music industry today and what is what.  The fact it most of what is out there is garbage. The facts are in if you know a damn thing about music; Green Day is a very talented band, musically speaking.  You don't play together for 16+ years and not develop into something noteworthy.  Second, Punk formed because it was rebellious, and this album is about as rebellious as anything kids will listen to today without having to search through the indy bins or even discover a great band like System of a Down who is still not completely MAINSTREAM as far as I know.  NOW, TODAY Punk is still rebellious but it is also profitable for the record companies and Rock is Rock so call Green Day what you want but if you are living in the now and not 1979 they are Punk Rock but any person who likes Rock music hopefully is open minded enough to see this and likes bands that fit into both genres as the differences are not as distinct as they once were. <br /> <br />With that said The ALBUM I am reviewing...as I mentioned before I have been aware of Green Day for about 16 years before American Idiot was released and if you asked me prior to hearing this album if I liked Green Day my response would have been something like, \\"yeah they are alright\\". <br /> <br />American Idiot is a HUGE LEAP forward for the mascara clad boys from Callie.  This album is brilliant first and foremost musically speaking.  Is this the same band?  WOW!  What an amazing album, I was absolutely blown away the first time I heard it and couldn't stop listening for almost 2 months with little else to wet my pallete, it is rare when an album that good comes along.  It is both a credit and a sad day when in such a fascitic state a band like Green Day comes out with one of the most political albums of recent times.  I praise them for their stand in such polarized and sharply political times but where are the rest of the bands in the mainstream like Rage when we need them now more than ever?  And while it is never too late I was blown away to see Green Day make TWO HUGE LEAPS forward, musically and politically! <br /> <br />Anyway, while this band has three throwback seventies rock anthems on this album (at least in length and musical transitions) which makes it a stretch for many to call this album PUNK but labels are for those who are hung-up on the BS that comes with them.  Not that some labels aren't important but again Punk has evolved well beyond the 3 chord, F*%K YOU days to a real form of music and with that said Green Day has made themselves the reigning kings of Punk Rock with this brilliant release.  IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS ALBUM THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU, BUY IT NOW! YOU ARE MISSING ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF RECENT YEARS, GO, GO, GO!
B00006AUIG|5.0|[...]    After viewing the incredible pictures on the Opacity website, I then discovered Session 9.  I first rented the movie, then I bought it on Amazon. I watch the movie, not only because of the story, but to see what no longer exists at the Danvers Asylum site.  The \\"extras\\" on the DVD show how beautiful this Kirkbride designed building is, but the experiences of the cast and crew.  The extras, in my humble opinion, are better than the movie itself.      Thomas Kirkbride, the architect of several \\"insane asylums\\" on the east coast and elsewhere, built beautiful victorian buildings for the insane, in order to becalm the unfortunate inhabitants.  Unfortunately, these \\"castles\\" were stretched to the limit with the population of the insane.  They were shut down in the 1970s and onward due to overcrowding and reports of abuse.  Danvers was shut down in the 1990s and was left to decay.  Danvers was on the Historic Register of Historic Places, but was sold by the town of Danvers to Avalon Bay, a nation-wide company who specializes in up-scale apartment living.    Do I recommend this movie!  You bet I do!  I recommend it because Danvers no longer exists and I recommend it for the suspense and the story line.  But I recommend it for anyone who loves beautiful old buildings in this country that are being destroyed in the name of commerce and the lack of feeling.  I thank God this movie exists.    Gordon Rules!!

B0000004V2|5.0|This album may be considered overrated for anyone familiar with a some music-related publications, such as the New Musical Express (NME) and the British newspaper The Observer, which both placed it as #1 on a list of Best Albums and Best British Albums respectively. In another sense, it may be seen as underrated because when you mention \\"The Stone Roses\\", (unless, perhaps, you are somewhere in Great Britain or are talking to a well-versed music fan), nobody knows who you are talking about! At any rate, I feel that this album deserves attention.     The Stone Roses (formed in 1984 in Manchester, England and disbanding in 1996) only released two albums, but have left a considerable impact on British music. They were considered a premier band of the \\"Madchester\\" genre (along with others like the Happy Mondays), which blended dance music with more 60s-inspired, psychedelic-style rock. This becomes immediately apparent when listening to any of the songs on their debut album, with the complex layers of instruments melding together lyrics and melodies. Instead of skipping around, I generally listen to it from start to finish, since the album flows very nicely from song to song.     I first found out about The Stone Roses from an Elijah Wood article in Blender magazine. He said that his most favourite album of all-time could be the debut from The Stone Roses, which he had first listened to when they were filming The Lord of the Rings in New Zealand. After I noticed it appearing on various lists of \\"Best Albums\\" as well, I decided to buy it and find out what the fuss was about. I was really pleasantly surprised. Even though I bought it several months ago, I still listen to the whole album fairly often. I'm not so sure that I'd say it was the best album I've heard, but I'd probably put it somewhere in my top ten.
B00005JP87|3.0|The film will probably be accepted as one of the better period pieces, yet it does not rise beyond that.  It has a long drawn out plot, little action, and mostly just good photography and acting.  This was good but it needed more to rise above the other period pieces; this is not a thriller or suspense, or even close.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The late 90s/early 00s have brought a stream of a few unusually talented \\"garage rock\\" bands. These bands generally use lo-fi recording equipment as opposed to making everything digital. The rawness of sound is preserved and making music for music's sake is emphasized, as opposed to commercial fame alone. Mainstream music still consists of mass-produced pop, rap, and hip-hop for the most part, however unfortunate that may be. However, there are times when genuinely good bands are able to slip through, on to the radio and hopefully are able to attract the attention of enough people in order to sell albums and concert tickets. The Strokes happened to debut at the right time.     The Strokes, like their influences Television and The Velvet Underground that came before them, originated in New York. They were able to release a three-song EP in 2001, which was then followed by heavy competition from rival record labels until they were finally signed to RCA to release their full debut \\"Is This It\\". The hype surrounding the album was, and often still is, incredibly overwhelming. After listening to \\"Is This It\\", you'll probably feel that the hype is well-deserved.     In my opinion, few albums deserving 5-stars have been released in the 2000s. I'm not sure if this is because of the throw-away society that we live in...the mass-downloading of radio tracks, the lack of creativity in the music industry, etc. The Strokes comes out of the blue at a time when stylish, well thought-out music seemed to almost have disappeared entirely. Notable bands that also contributed to this \\"garage rock revival\\" include The White Stripes, The Hives, The Vines, and The Libertines. Though inspired by a wide variety of past rock groups, none of these bands give off the impression of \\"stealing\\" the style of previous bands nor even \\"borrowing\\"! These bands each blend together their influences in a unique way, with a dash of modern sensibility. There are a number of other recent bands that dwell inmusic of the past and/or copy each other. I feel that the aforementioned bands represent a new kind of music; taking the best of your own musical influences and incorporating your own style as well. This concept really isn't new all, because artists and bands have been doing just that for years. However, it is new to many young people of this generation, because it appears we all might need a reminder of what a great band is really capable of. We have a say in what we listen to. In fact, we have more choice than ever before in some ways, because the Internet has opened up a more accessible way of finding new music. Sometimes I think that people don't think to look very hard to find good music; it's as if they expect it will just come to them on the radio or on MTV! It is often not so, though The Strokes have gotten some radio play, many brilliant bands can go unnoticed if people don't seek them out.     \\"Is This It\\" has had such a great impact, that it seems that The Strokes haven't been able to recapture the effect on their other two albums, \\"Room On Fire\\" and \\"First Impressions of Earth\\". These albums, rather than making a transition to something greater, try to hang onto the kind of mood captured in \\"Is This It\\". It may be somewhat impossible for The Strokes make something equal or greater than their debut, since there has been so much anticipation of the bands' next move after its release.    In conclusion, The Strokes have made a lasting impact on music of the early 00s, and \\"Is This It\\" will undoubtedly serve as inspiration for more bands later on.
B00006GA48|5.0|'Closer To Home' is one of the finest heavy rock discs ever produced, plain and simple.  While much is made of the title track, the album rocks steady from one end to the other, offering a showcase for the many methods to master (and in this case, remaster) metal music:  METAL GOES STOMPING on the opening track, the incisive 'Sin's a Good Man's Brother' (\\"but is that right....?\\").  After lulling the listener with a soft acoustic introduction, the first question you'll be asking is: can three guys really generate this many decibels all by themselves?      METAL GOES JOGGING on track two, 'Aimless Lady', with its heavy, loping strides.  The testosterone laced lyrics (\\"if you can stand a real good man, take my hand and understand me, baby\\") are supported by fine falsetto backing harmony from drummer Don Brewer.  METAL GETS A FUNK GROOVE on 'Nothing Is the Same', complete with a sweet, fuzzy bridge from singer Mark Farner's lead guitar.  The songsmith observes how life has changed from when he was 16, to 18, to \\"just a little bit older\\", to \\"future years\\" and Nothing Is the Same.  METAL BLEEDS A LITTLE on 'Mean Mistreater', which starts out in slow-blues mode, but quickly builds steam into a blazing bridge before collapsing into the bluesy coda.  METALLIC PSYCHEDELIA emerges on 'Get It Together', which is for the most part an organ-driven instrumental, save the mantra-like coda, \\"got to get it together\\", delivered by Farner, Brewer, and several soulful ladies in the background.  METAL GOES STRUTTING on 'I Don't Have To Sing the Blues' which is really two songs, two songs mixed into one.  A slick lead guitar riff provides the foundation over fat and fuzzy bass lines from Mel Schacher, supporting wicked lyrics such as, \\"she's my dinner and my Midnight snack... she sets up and she begs and she even rolls over on her back\\".  METAL GOES POETIC in the coda, wrapping more great lyrics around the \\"I don't have to sing the blues no more\\" chorus.  METAL BENDS AND DISTORTS on 'Hooked On Love', where a heavy bass line propels this song through several incarnations, and featuring a torrid bridge from Farner's wah-pedal guitar.  METAL GOES ANTHEMIC on the title track, my favorite part of which is the rich, fuzzy yet smooth lead guitar bridge... but also the early, all too brief wah-pedal.  The liner notes talk extensively about the accidental \\"Alright, stop it\\" from producer Terry Knight that appears one minute into the track.  Although the author of the liner notes, Steve Roeser, makes it sound like the gaffe is hardly noticable, I've always been aware of it.  It seems to fit right in with the \\"Stop it!, Stop it!\\" that appears in the 'Hey Jude'-ish finish.  But just in case you want to REALLY hear it, check out the hidden track following the bonus tracks where the miscue is isolated and amplified for you!    Bonus tracks are always appreciated, but two more versions of 'Mean Mistreater' (one from a concert in Orlando in June of 1970, which isn't appreciably different from the studio take, and the other IS the studio take, with only slight alterations in the finish), don't add much in the first case, and amount to one too many renditions in the other.  However, two other tracks from that night in Orlando will put some flash in your CD laser.  The first is a nearly twelve minute excursion on 'In Need' from the bands 1970 self-titled disc, and a seven minute-plus rendition of the classic 'Heartbreaker' from 1969's 'On Time' disc.  Add to all this a sparkling remastered sound, period photographs and memorabilia, snazzy graphics, detailed track information, and relevant liner notes, and you have what is known in the business as the complete package.  'Closer To Home' is a milestone in rock history right out of my backyard of Flint, Michigan.  The soundtrack of your life is incomplete without it.
0142000663|4.0|Set during the Great Depression, this novel chronicles the life of a family of sharecroppers, the Joads. They are driven from their home in Oklahoma due to the Dust Bowl (a series of dust storms causing severe drought) and hard times. Along with thousands of others who have also lost their land, the Joads decide to move to California with the promise of work and a better way of life. However, once they get there, they find that there is not much work to be found and even if they get work, the pay isn't fair. The Californians they encounter treat them with disdain, calling them \\"Okies\\" and fearful that these newcomers might band together and take over the land.<br /><br /> John Steinback's writing is so vivid that you could almost believe that the main characters actually existed in real life. The protagonist, Tom Joad, is portrayed as a man willing to protect his family, but with a temper that occasionally interferes with the course of his life. The novel opens with Tom Joad being released on parole from killing a man in self-defense. The man he encounters on his way back home, Jim Casy, is another artfully crafted character; a preacher with a penchant for giving long speeches about life and its inner workings. They walk together to Tom Joad's former residence, only to find that it is deserted. When they get to the house of Tom's uncle, the rest of his family is preparing to move, thus Tom Joad and Casy decide to go with them to California, and so the story goes on.<br /><br /> A combination of authentic Oklahoma dialogue and articulate descriptions of scenery and action allow this novel to almost live and breathe, as if it is being presented before your eyes. The effect of this novel is similar to that of Charles Dickens' writing; that is, the novel is so close to the history it represents, it will leave quite an impact upon you and serve as a reminder to how powerful great story-telling can be.
B000HA4WTI|5.0|This movie was Great!  The Drifting was GREAT.  I like this over the 2 fast 2 furious but i would say fast and the furious 3 and the fast and the furious was a good movie I would buy them both again..A+++++++
B000HCO840|3.0|X-men 3:  The Last Stand was really a movie with some interesting parts.  I loved the special effects and the variety of mutants on-screen.  What I didn't like was how quickly Cyclops (Scott Summers) and Professor Xavier died in this movie.  It didn't have any suspense or theatrical moments.  Cyclops didn't even fight.  Also mystique barely had any on-screen time as well.  All the main mutants from the previous movies have now taken a backseat and the roles have reversed where the side mutants in the other movies are now the main mutants in this movie.  Does that make sense?   <br /> <br />Juggernaut was pretty cool, but he had an accent.  I didn't know juggernaut had an accent like he was from another country.  It would have been nice to see rogue fight, but she was being a pansy and wanted to rid herself of her abilities instead of using it to help her friends. <br /> <br />Bobby a.k.a. Iceman vs. Pyro was good although Iceman didn't go all ice until the last end of the fight where he was only like that for 2 seconds.  I would have liked to see him stay in that mode during the fight and maybe have pyro manipulate the fire better to have it take form or something. <br /> <br />Lastly, the ending didn't make sense.  If the movie is called \\"the LAST stand\\" why did they make the ending seem like it's open to another movie?  If they are gonna call it the last stand, it should stay as THE LAST STAND. <br /> <br />All in all...this movie was good, but not great.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|I don't know what the people below are thinking.  The picture quality is just fine on the original 1977 version and if you get the widescreen version, you get the widescren version.  My only complaint is that there are really no extras to really make this special.  All three movies have a demo for Lego Star Wars II and it's only for the XBox.  So, yeah: Both movies, nothing special... other than the fact you get the unalterd originals that we all loved when we were younger.
B000AP2ZLC|4.0|Let me just get out of the way that I am not crazy about Lord Worm on vocals, however, on this reunion CD I will have to say that he delivers his best performance yet. As for the CD as a whole, this is what death metal should be like if it's executed properly. Cryptopsy is one of the more diverse bands in death metal that knows how to not only play INSANELY fast (especially the machine gun like drums) but they take you on a musical rollercoaster that isn't typical of most death metal bands such as consistently changing tempos, & even playing upbeat sounding notes as opposed to the usual doomy/creepy notes. 'Once was Not' has everything you would expect from Cryptopsy; it's also the band's heaviest & tighest offering to date!
B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater has never been one to hold back their interests of compromise their talents, but THIS is the album that they wanted to make for so many years. Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory is actually the song Metropolis Part 1: The Miracle And The Sleeper but in album length, and less obscure. I know people before me have already explained the plot, but I'll throw in my 2 cents: It's about a man named Nicholas who's having nightmares about a murder of a young girl, and goes to a hypnotherapist to try and get rid of his nightmare. The hypnotherapist tells him to \\"close your eyes and relax your body,\\" (Regression) and he's thrown back into the year 1928 to reveal the mystery (Overture: 1928). He meets the girl murdered, whose name is Victoria Page, and there's a quick duet between the 2 (Strange Deja Vu, Through My Words). Nicholas \\"travels to another home\\" to find more information, and the man living at this house tells him that Victoria was murdered in that particular house(Fatal Tragedy). Nicholas then finds a paper that he reads to himself. It tells about the murder, and how the murderer, Julian Baynes, apparently killed himself with a note in his pocket that says \\"I'd sooner take my life away then live with losing you.\\" (Beyond This Life) Once Nicholas finds out how she is killed (at least he thinks that's how), he gets depressed and wishes he could've stoppped the murder (Through Her Eyes). In Home, Julian Baynes (refered to as \\"The Sleeper\\") feels the need to stay with Victoria though he knows she's already with his brother Senator Edward Baynes (refered to as \\"The Miracle\\"). Then it goes to Edward speaking. He talks about how he hates him for stealing his lover, but he doesn't know what to do because Julian is his brother. This makes Nicholas think that maybe Edward was the one that killed Victoria.... The Dance Of Eternity is an instrumental, which I believe is supposed to represent what love is (I say that because of the lyrics from the song this album is rooted from). In One Last Time, Nicholas goes to the house to watch the murder, and he hears a \\"woman screaming, a man pleads forgiveness. His words I cannot hear.\\" In The Spirit Carries On, Nicholas no longer feels sad about Victoria death and he sees that he's a lot happier about his life and how he's no longer afraid about dying. In Finally Free, Edward starts off the song by telling himself he needs to cover up the murder he's commited and he needs to plant some sort of suicide note in Julian's pocket so..... yeah, HE was the one who murdered him. Then it goes into the past and Victoria starts talking, and she admits to herself she loves Julian. But before she can reach she sees Edward shooting Julian. Then he shoots Julian and arranges their corpses in Victoria's house to make the police believe his story. But in the beginning of the song, you hear the hynotherapist talking and he tells Nicholas that when he tells him to open his eyes he'll be free. That means all of that happened before he told him to open his eyes. Anyway, back to Nicholas. Near the end of the song, you hear sound effects which are, I believe, Nicholas walking through a house with a TV on that is telling the stroy of another murder. Then the therapist tells him to open his eyes. Nicholas wakes up surprised and.... I actually have no idea what happens. There's a lot of controversy over the last part. Some say the therapist kills Nicholas, other say Nicholas was surprised because he wasn't really ready to leave 1928. I suppose only thre bandmemebers would know, but if they told us, it would probably take away some of the album's magic.<br /><br /> I can't decide whether this or Images And Words is my favorite DT album. Don't get me wrong, pretty much the whole DT catalogue is worth listening to, but I feel those 2 are the strongest. By the way, throughout the whole album, there's some amazing musical passages, such as in Overture 1928, which has an awesome guitar solo from John that emulates the way James sang the chorus in Metropolis Part 1, more great guitar riffs in Home (which is accompanied by a sitar), and great dual keyboard solos from Jordan Rudess - the bands new keyboardist. Of course, John Myung also shines in this album, with his equally technically perfect basslines, and Mike Portony's drumming is as great as ever. Everything about this band is great, and it's a rotten shame they aren't getting as much attention as manufactured \\"artists\\" like 50 Cent and Ashlee Simpson. It just proves to show you how stupid and ignorant the public is I guess. So buy this album, along with the rest of the Dream Theater catalogue. They have been, are, and shall forever continue making some of the best music on Earth.<br /><br />And one last thing. To the constant supply of Dream Theater bashers who say how self-indulgent they are and how they only rely on showing off, you're all wrong. If you would bother to pay attention to the lyrics, you would see that not only are they incredible musicians, but they also have lyrics that perectly balance seriousness and emotion.<br /><br /> 6 favorite songs: Home, Finally Free, Fatal Tragedy, Beyond This Life, Strange Deja Vu, and Overture 1928 (of course, all of the songs are great).<br /><br />Long live Dream Theater!!!way James sang the chorus in Metropolis Part 1, more great guitar riffs in Home (which is accompanied by a sitar), and great dual keyboard solos from Jordan Rudess - the bands new keyboardist.

B00004XPPK|4.0|Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford star in Gilda, a noir thriller set in Buenos Aires.  Ford plays Johnny, a down on his luck gambler who is picked up by a casino owner.  Johnny quickly becomes the casino owner's right-hand man--with a pact that women and gambling don't mix.  Then Johnny's boss comes back from a trip with a new wife, Gilda,played incandescently by Rita Hayworth.  Gilda is a typical noir femme fatale.  She acts fast and loose but is actually just trying to get her guy jealous.  Of course, her guy isn't her husband--its Johnny.<br /><br />This odd little story is highly likeable for about three quarters of the film, when it makes a strange detour.  Fortunately for us, the story gets right back on track at the end.<br /><br />Ford does a good job as the loyal and jealous Johnny.  He is vibrant, athletic and serious.  Hayworth's beauty glows and gleams.  She is given quite a few song and dance numbers.  Her dancing is talented but strangely loose limbed.  The movie steams with chemistry between Ford and Hayworth which is fortunate because the plot is more than a little cockeyed.  The filming is gorgeously contrasted black and white with the requisite shadowy interiors.
B00005JPAD|5.0|Filmmaker extraordinaire Martin Scorsese finally brings back the dazzling intensity of his earlier films such as \\"Taxi Driver\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\" with his latest offering, a driving Americanized update of the 2002 Hong Kong thriller, \\"Infernal Affairs\\". Adapted with intelligence by screenwriter William Monahan, the now Boston-based story focuses in parallel fashion on two young police detectives who are leading deceptive existences, one is sharing the department's goings-on with local mob boss Frank Costello, while the other is undercover inside Costello's organization and secretly informing the police of their plans. The informant is Colin Sullivan, who impresses his supervisors with his savvy and unfettered ambition. The other detective is coiled-to-the bone Billy Costigan recruited by Captain Queenan and his hot-headed assistant, Sgt. Dignam, to infiltrate Costello's gang.<br /><br />Both detectives are loners in one way or the other because they are moles always looking over their shoulder lest they get caught and killed. The movie dexterously goes back and forth between the characters with the linchpins being not only Costello but also a department psychiatrist named Madolyn. She becomes Sullivan's girlfriend and also Costigan's doctor. As you can guess, the destinies of Costigan and Sullivan intertwine like a tightening vise but not without several interrelated storylines battling for our attention. One of the key reasons that this approach works so effectively is the kinetic, time-jumping editing by longtime Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker, infusing Scorsese's masterful direction and the adept unraveling-by-necessity character development.<br /><br />A stellar cast is in peak form here starting with Leonardo DiCaprio's riveting turn as Costigan. Under Scorsese's tutelage for the third time, he has finally matured into a role that capitalizes on his visceral intensity and delivers easily the best work I have seen him do. If Matt Damon's solid work is slightly less electrifying (with a vocal resemblance to the southie he played in \\"Good Will Hunting\\"), it's primarily because the character is designed to be unapologetically covert and a braggadocio to boot. Of course, Jack Nicholson is getting the lion's share of the media attention because he is back in a showy role as Costello. Whether making subtly threatening non-sequiturs to the hapless in his neighborhood or sharing Costello's path to success with his young cohorts, Nicholson blazes without resorting to the scenery chewing we have seen in past roles.<br /><br />As Madolyn, indie darling Vera Farmiga brings an unexpectedly idiosyncratic quality to what could have been the standard girl-support stereotype, bringing not only vulnerability but a guarded sense of adventurousness to her character. In supporting roles, Martin Sheen is solid as Queenan, but it's the rapid-fire profanity spewing out of Marc Wahlberg as Dignam that remains more memorable. Ray Winstone brings his trademark menace to Costello's amusingly named henchman, Mr. French, and Alec Baldwin shines in the smallish role of department head Ellerby. It should come as no surprise that there are moments of shocking violence as the movie culminates into a series of scenes quite graphic in nature yet thematically resonant to the core story. Scorsese has thankfully let go of the wearying pretensions of his last two movies, \\"The Aviator\\" and \\"Gangs of New York\\", to produce an incredibly taut, character-driven police thriller.

B0000C3I6U|5.0|Bodybuilding used to be a beautiful sport. There were a few guys that maybe weighed close to 250lbs but they still had lines, proportions, and symmetry. Nowadays the sport is filled with guys who weigh 300+ and they're only 5'11\\". In a word, they look absolutely ridiculous. Now I wouldn't go down to Venice Beach and tell them that unless I really wanted to know what my butt smelled like, but there really is no sense of style about the sport anymore. In fact, I think the last time bodybuilding was a thing of real beauty and art was probably in 1983. I think as soon as Frank Zane walked off the stage for the last time, bodybuilding just became a freak show.<br /><br />This film is based on the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest in South Africa. It features the one and only Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now in this film he was 6'2\\" and weighed about 235 lbs. Nothing to sneeze at, right? Well, if he walked onstage with today's synthetically charged monsters he would probably get sand kicked in his face.<br /><br />But this was the golden age of bodybuilding. This is a time when it had class and style and a sense of camaderie. Not any more. Sure, there was competition, but there was a sense of fun about the whole thing. In this reel of film, one gets to see the real Arnold. Nobody had more fun with his competition than Arnold. In one memorable scene Arnold is eating breakfast with Lou Ferrigno (the Incredible Hulk). It is the day before the actual contest and Arnold says with a sly grin on his face, \\"Hey, Louie...I called my mother last night, I told her I already won...\\"<br /><br />Now you may think that that is unsportmanslike, but it's just classic Arnold. Before Arnold became a celebrity, he really did have a genuine personality. Maybe he still does, but his humor seems a lot more contrived these days whereas before it was more spontaneous and even childlike.<br /><br />I had an old VHS taped copy that I used to watch at least twice a year. I pulled it out not too long ago and I guess somewhere along the way somebody decided to tape a porno over it. Oh, there was plenty of pumping going on but it wasn't iron and they weren't at the gym.

0141439734|5.0|_The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Other Tales of Terror_, in the Penguin Classics series, consists of three tales by Robert Louis Stevenson, an essay by Stevenson, as well as an introduction and \\"diagnosis of Dr. Jekyll\\" by the editor Robert Mighall.  Stevenson (1850-1894) was a Scottish writer in the Victorian period who grew up to a strict Presbyterian upbringing which would lead him to become obsessed with sin, the nature of evil, and death throughout much of his life.  Originally Stevenson wrote adventure tales and stories of pirates (_Treasure Island_ for example); however, he was to turn his writing talents to tales of horror and the supernatural, particularly with the stories seen here.  Stevenson wrote these stories to be read during the Christmas season (one traditionally associated with the supernatural and tales of dread).  While Stevenson was much influenced by his own strict upbringing, he also was influenced by the various evolutionary theories of criminology then popular in the Victorian period.  In particular, the eugenic theories of Francis Galton and the criminological theories of Caesare Lombroso (who claimed to have found the source of the \\"atavistic criminal type\\") were then popular.  Stevenson also may have been interested in sexual pathology (a taboo topic during the Victorian era).  In particular, many of his stories hint at homosexuality or possibly sexual sadism (and the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was to influence the writing of Oscar Wilde who was convicted of sodomy in his time).  Stevenson's stories reveal the dark side of man and the hypocrisy of the \\"respectable\\" during the Victorian period. <br /> <br />This book contains the following tales (and essay): <br /> <br />_Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde_  (1886)  -  This is the classic tale of a double consciousness.  The respectable Dr. Jekyll, an upright citizen of a higher status, begins to develop a secret nature (to become a \\"secret sinner\\") which eventuallyleads him to construct the personality of a Mr. Edward Hyde as an alter.  Mr. Hyde is a repulsive figure to behold, uniformly despised by those who see him, short in stature, possibly deformed, and bearing some resemblance to the simian.  Mr. Hyde is also the classic atavistic criminal type, believed to be lower on the evolutionary ladder than the righteous Dr. Jekyll.  Dr. Jekyll concocts a potion which he intakes and becomes the sinister Mr. Hyde.  Thus, begins a classic conflict between the good and evil natures within man.  While Dr. Jekyll leads an upright life, his alter Mr. Hyde engages in brutal activities, nearly plows over a child on the street, and eventually murders a man.  The story unfolds as Dr. Jekyll's lawyer and friend tries to understand why Dr. Jekyll should choose such a repulsive individual as Hyde as his benefactor to his will and the ensuing transformation in Jekyll.  Eventually the transformation begins to occur in Jekyll without the use of the potion, so Jekyll vows to stop taking it.  However, he returns to the potion again eventually (perhaps hinting at the horrors of alcoholism or other addiction) and becomes Mr. Hyde again.  Eventually the personality of Mr. Hyde is to overcome completely Dr. Jekyll (as his potion runs out).  Thus is revealed the dual nature of man. <br /> <br />\\"The Body Snatcher\\"  (1884)  -  This tale involves the procurement of bodies to be dissected by medical students.  At the time, the bodies used by medical students were in short supply.  These bodies are supplied to a Dr. K__ (perhaps, Robert Knox, a real life physician who was implicated in a similar scandal); however, it soon becomes apparent that they have been murdered.  The story ends with a bizarre twist.  This story was a precursor to _Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde_, and it features many of the same surroundings. <br /> <br />\\"Olalla\\"  (1885)  -  This is a classic Gothic tale featuring a voyage by a man suffering from tuberculosis (which Stevenson himself was tosuffer from) to Catholic Spain.  There he stays with an ancient family which is under a horrifying curse - degeneracy of the blood.  Stevenson based this story on many of the evolutionary beliefs popular at the time, including the hereditary nature of madness and \\"bad blood\\".  The family described in this story, though of noble birth, has a history of this \\"taint of the blood\\" brought about by too much inbreeding.  The story involves vampirism (the longing for blood, which perhaps influenced the later writings of Bram Stoker, whose Dracula was also an atavistic criminal type of a tainted heritage) and the narrator falls in love with Olalla, a daughter of the family. <br /> <br />\\"A Chapter on Dreams\\"  (Abridged)  (1888)  -  This is an essay written by Stevenson in which he discusses his dreams (the role of the \\"Brownies\\" (elfin creatures) in their creation) and the source of his inspiration for _Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde_. <br /> <br />The final section of this book is an essay by the editor Robert Mighall, entitled \\"Diagnosing Jekyll:  The Scientific Context of Dr Jekyll's Experiment and Mr Hyde's Embodiment\\".  This essay discusses the role of double-consciousness (the possibility of multiple personality), moral insanity, criminal responsibility, and sexual perversion in the character of Dr. Jekyll.  It is most interesting for its remarks on the evolutionary theories of criminology popular at the time and the possible sexual perversion of Dr. Jekyll.  This essay also discusses the case of \\"Jack the Ripper\\", which played out in London at the same time as _Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde_ was appearing on the stage, and its relationship to this story. <br /> <br />This book includes several interesting stories by Stevenson which reveal his continuing obsessions, the dual nature of man and the evolutionary taint of \\"bad blood\\".  They show us how even the most respectable, upright individuals may have a dual nature (a dark side), though it is often hidden.  They also have much to say about the societal hypocrisy which makes such a thing possible to begin with.  The need to \\"keep up appearances\\" often betrays a darker side. <br />

B000HT386M|2.0|Watching CLICK is like watching two separate movies. The blatant parallels to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE are transparent, but that's not what makes Click a clunker. Not that it is a clunker in its entirety, either.<br /><br />The story surrounds Michael Newman (Adam Sandler, WATERBOY), an architect who yearns for peace and harmony in his life. Part of the problem is the competition (keeping up with the Jones') that he has going on with his neighbors. They have a new RV, new toys and new cars, while Michael and his family just get by. One evening he hears the irritating boy next door talking about his father's new universal remote control that's patched into everything (garage door, TV, stereo, etc.) and it's all that Michael can take. So he heads out to the mall and stops at (of all places) Bed, Bath and Beyond. It is the \\"Beyond\\" that apparently pulls him in, but once inside all he finds are towels and bedding. He lays down on one of these and then quickly spots a doorway that says \\"Beyond\\". It looks rather ethereal yet inviting, so Michael goes on in. What he finds is a whacked out looking guy named Morty (Christopher Walken) who offers him a truly \\"Universal Remote.\\" This remote control does it all. It can rewind you to your birth so that you can witness it (or your conception, something we should NEVER have to see), or it can fast-forward you through troubling times, like arguments with your spouse or personal illnesses. The dangers of this Universal Remote aren't evident right away. Apparently, as this magical tool gets used to your requests, it does them automatically for you, without you having to push a button. So when Michael fast forwards through arguments with his wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale), the remote does it automatically for him in the future. Thus, large chunks of what might seem like inane discussions suddenly are wiped away.<br /><br />Michael soon discovers that his life is in constant fast forward. His job, his kids, his wife, even his own body, change in rapid succession as the Universal Remote takes over. Trying to give back this dangerous piece of machinery, we soon learn that Morty is much more than he seems.<br /><br />The great thing about the film is the last 2/3 of it (with the exception of the ending, which we'll cover in a moment). When people learn how important life is, it's truly an eye-opener. And this is where Click succeeds. When Sandler's character learns about death and how important it is to live every second of every day, it is heart renderingly pulled off. We get to witness Sandler rewinding time and again the important portions of his life that he missed. And, near the end of his own life, we witness his evolution into a man of distinction, trying to save his son from his own deadly mistakes related to family.<br /><br />Where the film fails is the beginning and it's horribly cliched ending. The beginning of the film is filled with bathroom humor (farting in people's faces) and gag jokes that sag under their own terrible weight. This is where one feels like they are watching an entirely different film when compared to the latter 2/3 of the movie. The characters are one-dimensional and utterly unbelievable (quite the dichotomy from what we see later). This isn't a character evolution issue as much as a script failure.<br /><br />The ending of the film is what finally gives it a poor rating. When we see Sandler lay down at Bed, Bath and Beyond, a creeping disgust enters the mind. The film-makers surely wouldn't use one of the oldest cliches in the book, would they? But, oh yes, they did. Grrr!<br /><br />The unfortunate thing about Click is that it really has a wonderful message and some fine acting moments. Special effect make-up artist Rick Baker also deserves much credit for the aging looks he puts the characters through, from Henry Winkler's role as Sandler's father, to Sean Astin's speedo and chubby swim instructor, it was one of the strongest aspects of the entire production.<br /><br/>As a whole, the film fails because of its childish beginnings and over-used style ending. But make no mistake, there are some great moments in here. Just not enough to give it a high ranking.duction. <br /> <br />As a whole, the film fails because of its childish beginnings and over-used style ending.

0307263118|1.0|Trying to figure out the point. Language is good...but content Zip. I normally don't put books down half way. Am very tempted to do it with this one. Can't believe this won an award
0440224764|2.0|The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)<br /><br />The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.<br /><br />I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish.

0307276902|5.0|I have always wondered what happens in a Treatment center. How do people stop being an addict? What do they do all day? What kind of people are in a treatment center? This book answers those questions and shows that there's hope for every addict. I think it's an excellent read. A gift to all addicts.  It's exiting, I couldn't put it down and I thought about it quit a lot.
B000GY729M|2.0|I had to listen to this one several times before making up my mind. The Killers have shown a new face, which isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't connect with their old face at all. In Hot Fuss, the songs were great and the melodies easy to pick out and sing along with. In Sam's Town, Flowers can't seem to find his own melody. His pitches are all over the map and they don't seem to blend with what the rest of the band is doing. It is a unique style that might be okay for one or two tracks, but a whole CD? The Killers have indeed lost their 'Killers' edge, and I hope it comes back for round three. Definitely preview it before you buy it, or you'll be upset at throwing away 15 bucks. I'm just glad I got away only paying $10. Whew!
B000BBOUU4|4.0|This movie was so disturbing...  I thought the acting was good and overall it was a good movie, I just saw it as more disturbing than happy and chocolate factory-like. Although it seems strange, I would probably tag this as more of a horror movie than anything else. Strange o.0;
B000GY729M|4.0|So it's not another Hot Fuss...ok everyone get over it.  Let's quit comparing the album and judge it for what it really is - a pretty good second effort.  I would have to agree with the many other reviews that say you must to listen to it more than once.  I wasn't sure about it myself when I first played it but it has really grown on me and continues to get better, as I listen to it more.  It has a lot of catchy tunes and a lot of what we came to love the Killers for; which is a different sound, a throwback to the 80s, Flower's unique style, etc.  For all of you who are on the fence about buying it, just do it - you won't be disappointed.

0060989157|5.0|I recommend this book to anybody who is interested on the real life of rock and roll bands who don't burn out and break up after one or two years.  Being in a band is like being married to 4 people.  It is hard to get along, but they managed to do it without killing each other or themselves.  It got hairy at the end between Vince and Tommy, Vince trying to snitch on Tommy to get him thrown back in jail, what a pansy!  But from the beginning to the end, there just wasn't any boring spots.  I could have done without the \\"shooting\\" remarks, I'll let the readers figure that one out.  But I just ignore that stuff and stuck to the literary genius these guys put out.  Many Kudo's.  You will love this book too.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|The first half of this CD is quite good as it ranges from rockers to emotional works. However, the latter half of the CD seems to flatline, as everything, and I mean everything, revolves around Amy Lee's voice. While her singing is very impressive, one can only take her piercing high notes so long before if gets tiresome. The first album was a terrific mix of guitar solos, riffs, and Lee's abilities. The Open Door, however, is more of a show case of how high and loud Lee can sing. Is it worth buying? Yes, as there are several redeeming tracks. Is it better than Fallen? No, but it comes close.
B000GY729M|5.0|Yes, The Killers are here to stay. After going through the album for the first time, I wasn't sure what I thought. But then I kept listening to it over the past week since it's been out. It just gets better and better. <br /> <br />I loved the first track, Sam's Town, as soon as I heard it. It has a similar sound to other songs from their first album, Hot Fuss. <br />Enterlude and Exitlude are pretty much the same, and they are very solid. Believe me, I did enjoy my stay quite a bit... <br />We've all heard about the first single, When You Were Young, and I think pretty much everybody likes that one. <br />Bling (Confessions of a King) is absolutely phenomenal. The lyrics are great and has a fantastic tempo and beat. <br />For Reasons Unknown is another great track. I don't get why some people are saying they don't like it. I love the synthesizers 45 seconds into the song. <br />Read My Mind has an interesting sound to it and is a solid song, albeit not as good as the others so far. <br />Uncle Johnny is awesome. Excellent tune and beat to start things going. The Killers are at their best here with the lyrics. <br />Bones is pretty good too. I think it makes for a solid second single, but I'd probably choose Bling instead.  <br />My List is probably the weakest song on this album. It just seems very bland and out there, kind of like Believe Me Natalie, and Everything Will Be Alright- which were the only bad songs off of Hot Fuss. <br />This River is Wild is okay. I don't like it as much as I like the songs on the first half of the CD.  <br />Why Do I Keep Counting is a decent track as well. <br />The bonus track Where the White Boys Dance is a good song and probably could have made it to the actual album. <br /> <br />Overall, I love this CD. I'm very happy with it and I've had it since the day it came out. As numerous other people have been saying, it's no Hot Fuss. Sam's Town sounds a little different from Hot Fuss, but still sounds great. Once you listen to all the songs a few times, you will love it. I can't wait for the next CD! In the meantime, I'm going to buy the Killers book that Amazon is linking to this CD. The Killers are an absolutely phenomenal band and I hope they'll be around for awhile, unlike another one of my favorites, Linkin Park.
B000002NIW|5.0|Prior to the introduction of Around the Fur, the hardest music I probably listened to would have been Faith No More. I had been a fan of hard rock since I was a kid but never much dug the metal scene. That was until I listened to this album.... <br /> <br />By no means an all out metal album, it is however absolutely brutal (I mean that in a good way) at times! It drips emotion and energy like nothing I had ever heard. And woven within all the brutality is not only well written songs but songs with terrific melody. Its tough to even use the word melodic when speaking about Around the Fur because of its intensity and heaviness but its there. It was likely the reason I stuck with the album and later grew to consider it one of my all-time favorite albums. <br /> <br />The album starts off with the first single, My Own Summer, a hard hitting, energetic number, a great opening track. Stephen's signature crunching riffs continue on Lhabia, my favorite track from the album. And it continues throughout the album.... Other highlights include the title track, Dai the Flu, Lotion and Be Quiet..., the second single from the album. There is no real weak track on this album and the intensity never wains, even at quieter moments, for the duration of the album. By the end of it you feel like you've just climbed the stairs of the Empire State Building.... its exhausting and exhilerating at the same time. <br /> <br />This album came along at a dark time in my life and it could not have been better to blow off some of the pain and frusteration I was feeling at the time.  A terrific album by an extremely talented band, a must for any love of hard hitting and aggressive music.
B000GY729M|5.0|If The Killers' 2004 \\"Hot Fuss\\" album represented the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas - one-night stands, go-go dancers, gratuitous gambling and relationship problems between young adults; then 2006's \\"Sam's Town\\" is the gritty local casino down the road - with its motley crew of locals. If you're a patron of the \\"Hot Fuss\\" casino then you're not going to like travelling the route to \\"Sam's Town\\". However, if you are not necessarily looking for Hot Fuss Part 2, but something still unmistakenly The Killers, this album you will love.    We start the journey with the title track all ablaze with Brendan Flowers' walls of synth, thumping drums from Ronnie Vannucci, but also a chunky guitar part from Dave Keuning - something that musically sets the scene for the whole album. Here, Flowers greats the listener with the words 'Nobody ever had a dream 'round here...' (but he does of course) then questions 'Why do you waste my time?' in a big chorus, and then 'Have you ever seen the light?'. Flowers is answering his critics while showing them people can rise above their station (he was a former bellhop at the Gold Coast Hotel). The title track ushers in the new more mature Killers; the \\"Sam's Town\\" adult versus the \\"Hot Fuss\\" adolescent.    The video clip of the first single \\"When You Were Young\\" when placed in the album's context is much more meaningful. It depicts the plight of a naive young woman (in Sam's Town) who fell for the wrong guy. The single is musically an accurate gauge for the rest of the album; prominent guitars with big synth chorus.    The strangely titled track four is my favourite on the album. 'Bling (Confessions of a King)' is an amazingly constructed song, chugging along at a gallop with a wonderful melody and lyrics. I envision riding my horse in a rush to reach my destination with the wind blowing in my face in order to save my loved one thinking ... 'When I offer you survival, you say its hard enough to live...How do you know that you're right if you're not nervous anymore? It's not so bad, it's not so bad'. And when I think the song can't get any better, it has the most wonderfully uplifting ending with Flowers rising to 'higher and higher - we're gonna take it ... out of the fire, we're gonna make it'. \\"Sam's Town\\" is worth it just for this song.    The rest of the album doesn't relent either, especially the second single \\"Bones\\". We get a picture of potential lovers frolicking on a nearby river bank to the tune of 'don't you want to feel my bones on your bones?'. With its horns and Flowers' high pitched whine, this track sounds like a Robert Smith (The Cure) pop song circa mid 90's. It just showcases \\"The Killers\\" versatility. It follows the daunting \\"Uncle Johnny\\" with Mark Stoemer's great sliding bass lines (the best I've heard since Tool's song Lateralus). Uncle Johnny has wasted away his life in Sam's Town. This song is another reminder why The Killers are going to sell out stadiums around the world: when I wonder how the song will end a massive chorus of backing vocals hit like an anthem. This album is full of anthems: track 9 \\"My List\\", track 10 \\"This River is Wild\\", and track 11 \\"Why do I Keep Counting?\\" are huge conclusions to Sam's Town and will entertain crowds everywhere.    The greatest acts in the history of rock have evolved to shape music and The Killers have manifest into something special. It may not occur, but this album should be the one which catapults this band to be alongside the biggest band in the world - U2, if not superscede them. I didn't actually think The Killers were this good. Brendan Flowers himself said people will be remembering this album in 20 years time, I agree - it is that good.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|To me this was one of the better movies out there.  I agree that there seems to be a bit of a political slant to it. I also don't agree with everything in the movie. I do recognize that that is not what this movie was all about.  It was used as a premise.  It made for a good movie.  I have seen reveiws saying that this is pro anti-establishment or anti-government.  It might be but I think that although I am not either of these if the government in the movie existed I would be.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Finding Neverland is one of my all-time favorite films.  It is magical, funny, soulful, and an absolute pleasure to watch!  Throughout the film, a wonderful  message is driven--it claims that even though we get older, we don't have to grow up.  Its possible to pretend and stay young forever.  It explains  how time (crocodile with the ticking clock in its belly) is chasing everyone, and advocates people to really life, whatever that means for them.  The film encourages one to believe--in themselves, in others, in magic, and possibility.   <br /> <br />The performances by all the actors are astounding.  Johnny Depp was simply wonderful as the eccentric J.M. Barrie, Kate Winslet is great--as usual :), and the little boy, Freddie Highmore gives one of the best child actor performances I've ever seen.  The young boy steals the scenes from the top-tier actors he works with to deliver one of the most heart wrenching and believable characters to the screen.
B0000029DD|4.0|How else can you describe the combination of his beautiful voice and well written music?  I can't add anything to the volumes that have been written about this album already.  An album with well over 500 reviews that is holding a 4.5 star average must have something going for it. <br /> <br />I heard this album in bits as my wife bought it an played it too death.  So, I would hear a song here & a song there.  It was easy to like the guy's voice, but before long I found myself singing along with songs I had never sat down & really listened to myself.   <br /> <br />My favorite track is Last Goodbye but Mojo Pin, Lover You Should Have Come Over & Eternal Life are other fantastic songs on this Album.  This album is one of the shining spots of the last decade.   <br /> <br />I give this album 4 stars because I don't think it's a perfect album.  There are so few perfect albums.  This one is great, but doesn't get the playing time others do simply because it's a slow album full of mood music.  However, when the mood hits, there simply is nothing better.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This DVD Contains 2 versions of the same concert, The Original and The Director's Cut.  When you first watch this DVD, Do NOT Select \\"Play Movie\\" from the title menu.  Instead, select 'Bonus Materials' and Then \\"Original Film.\\"   <br /> <br />The Original Is Certainly the the way to watch this concert.  The Director's cut omits many visual effects from the original film, and shows different, but less interesting camera angles.  The flow of the concert is also sabotaged by the forceful addition of 'behind the scenes' footage of the band creating The Dark Side Of The Moon in between songs in the Director's Cut.  The Footage is valuable and interesting, but it ruins the 'feel' Of the concert.
0553579908|5.0|In my review of the first book in this series, A Game of Thrones, I explained why I was hooked - the reality of the characters and hardness of the world.  This continues admirably in the second book.<br /><br />Concentrating on the battles of the North between the armies of Robb Stark and the Lannisters, it seems as if Stark will win the entire region, and would if he weren't worried about treachery from Stannis, Renly, and even the machinations of Sansa - everyone seems to be against everyone else, all for their own piece of power.  All of the Stark children are on their own, and all of them have a powerful story linking disparate elements of such a rich and complex world, a world still so dangerous that nothing and no one is unscathed by its brutality.<br /><br />It's a long book, but not long enough because the reading is easy, the prose beautiful, and the pace tumultuous.  Most series encounter decline in quality for the second book, in which explanations are given and details are handled while preparing for the climaxes of the third book - not so in Fire and Ice.  This is a second book better than the first.<br /><br />Read, enjoy, and lose yourself in a world as real as ours but far more dangerous.<br /><br /> - CV Rick
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Bod Dylan, believe it or not, only gets better with age.<br /><br />Modern Times (the 3rd in the trilogy of music) is such an easy listen that one might overlook it as something less than it is.  Flooded with traditional blues hooks and riffs, Modern Times is less adventerous than \\"Love and Theft\\" but more than makes up for it's lack of adventure by falling in love with where the adventure led him.  Where \\"Love and Theft\\" was looking forward to where he was going, \\"Modern Times\\" reflects upon where he has been and where he is.<br /><br />The songs are instantly recognizable as Dylan's, even if you don't hear his voice, and they wash over you like a water over a waterfall.  These songs go down easy and they show you the true genius in Dylan.<br /><br />The Beginning - \\"Time out of Mind\\"<br /><br />The Middle - \\"Love and Theft\\"<br /><br />The End - \\"Modern Times\\"<br /><br />I will gladly wait however many years it takes Dylan to record another album.
B000F7CMRW|2.0|Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch. <br /> <br />While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.  As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else.  But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging...

It is indeed the LAST book you will need (and you do need it) to create saleable screenplays.<br /><br />That means it isn't the first one.  This book summarizes and organizes, rearranges emphasis, and illuminates all the myriad other techniques taught in other books.<br /><br />This book won't do you any good if you can't read a novel or watch a movie and identify the protagonist, antagonist, theme, Conflict, climax, resolution, denoument, and trace the plot, differentiating it from the story, and identify sub-plots, B-story, & C-story.<br /><br />It won't do you much good if you can't write a story smoothly incorporating those basic elements, most especially conflict.  (not necessarily a script, but a STORY.  This book doesn't teach storycraft.)<br /><br />You have to master all that storycraft first -- including spelling, punctuation and grammar (both common English grammar and script-ese.)<br /><br />But this book will draw a picture in your mind -- give you the image of exactly what it is you are trying to learn from all those other books on crafting a story for the screen, and save you lots of time as it points you to exactly what you must learn.<br /><br />Once you've mastered what all the other books have to teach you, and then you read this book again -- WOWWWWW!!!<br /><br />SAVE THE CAT! is the AHA! book at the end of the learning cycle.<br /><br />But it's more than that.  This is actually a thumb-reference book, a volume you keep on your desk and refer to over and over as you are laying out the structure of your screenplay from basic concept to blocked scenes.<br /><br />This slender volume, in ultra-condensed form, delineates most of the criteria that you must meet in order to produce a saleable screenplay.<br /><br />It's a checklist reminding you of everything you already know about story telling -- but keep forgetting when you write.  Keeping it on your desk and referring to it often can cut your production time in half by saving you many mistakes at the conceptual level.<br /><br />This is the book you will keep after you've thrown all the others into the recycle bin or given them to the library.<br /><br />But this is not the place to start if you haven't yet learned to turn a story on a clean conflict.<br /><br />Jacqueline LichtenbergTHE CAT! is the AHA! book at the end of the learning cycle.

B0000C5RQF|4.0|This is an excellent performance of the opera and well worth owning, unless, perhaps, you're looking for just one version for your collection, and in a traditional production. The principals range from good (Will Hartmann as Tamino) to outstanding (Simon Keenlyside as Papageno). Colin Davis conducts at a moderate pace, never making you think that things are moving too quickly or too slowly. The orchestra sounds excellent, too, and there is very good sound quality. (I listened in 5.1 Dolby Digital.)  <br /> <br />The production is interesting, for the most part serious, though at times in the second act it becomes hard to follow. After Tamino and Pamina are reunited, for example, there are dancers behind them apparently writhing in pain, but then moments later these same dancers congratulate Tamino and Pamino. It was never clear to me what they were meant to represent, or even why they were there at all. That said, this really is only a minor complaint. The production never distracts from the music.  <br /> <br />All in all I think this is more than worth the money.
B000EGDC14|5.0|One of the best dance/electronic albums I've ever heard. A masterful blend of thumping grooves, hypnotizing rhythms and silky vocals.
B000051YEG|5.0|The recent Ballad of Congressman Mark Foley initiated these comments. <br /> <br />Serge, jaded and driving his Silver Ghost Rolls Royce, with its \\"Venus of Money of 1910 posed on the radiator,\\" swerves off the road to find a \\"white skirt tied onto black pants\\" calling herself \\"Melody Nelson\\" with natural red curls.  Evidently Serge wants an English trophy to go along with his fancy English machine!  Her age?  \\"Quatorze automnes - Et quinze étés - Un petit animal.\\"   <br /> <br />Best not translated.  Anyway, this stuff wouldn't pass muster in the USA today.   <br /> <br />I give \\"Melody Nelson\\" five stars for the beauty of its orchestral arrangements.  Serge really knew how to get the groove out of his session musicians!!  Check out \\"Requiem por un con\\" for further grooviness.  Unfortunately this record is only 32 minutes long.
B000GUJZ4G|5.0|Can Gary Busey make a bad movie?  I don't think so.  No, this movie is not a work of art.  But among cheesy 90's action flicks, this one will live on forever.  It's got skydiving, surfing, bank robberies, police action, and Gary Busey.  The dialogue is a little lame, the story just a tad unbelievable, and the message is a little new-age teeny-bopperish, but I watch this one again and again, and love it every time.
0446615625|1.0|I don't write many reviews but I felt that I HAD to for this horrible piece of crap! How can a major publisher allow a book like this to be released? With it's ridiculous plot, incredibly boring dialogue, and horrible characters it's like reading something written by a dim-witted high school english student. <br /> <br />Bottom line: Reading \\"The Camel Club\\" was a very painful experience and should never be done by anyone!
B000002RXS|4.0|Maria Callas' CARMEN has had at best, a checkered history. It seems to have found a permanent home in many record collections over the years, considering it has been released as an LP, cassette, and now CD, so it's loved by many if not by all the critics. It had some foes before it was released. Callas had never performed CARMEN on stage and in 1964 when the set was first issued, it was believed that a recording should only showcase an artist's best work after years of perfection. Since Maria Callas was Maria Callas, Angel records took a chance and released it, knowing she'd probably never attempt the role on stage. As soon as it was released, there was a noticeable decline in her vocal abilities, which caught many fans off guard. Still, it's stood the test of time. Maria Callas at her not so great is still better than some at their peak, and even if the voice isn't perfect, it still has an expressive quality to it that's evident to anyone who listens to it.<br /><br />Maria Callas' performance for this set is interesting. One of the greatest strengths of her singing was her ability to portray a character through her voice and this may be why this set has a loyal following. We feel as if we are encountering the fiery, sensual woman that is Carmen in just about every note that Callas sings. It's hard not to forgive what some critics called an imperfect vocal performance when there is such a passion behind the singing. In the end, we have one of the most original interpretations of the role. Callas is joined by tenor Nicolai Gedda. Technically Gedda's performance cannot be faulted. He hits the notes and sings with ease. For Don Jose, this may not be enough, however. We want Jose to darken vocally as the opera progresses, and this does not happen. Gedda's strength is his beautiful voice that has suited him well in a great array of operas, but it doesn't have the robust quality that tenors such as Domingo or Corelli can bring to the role. For  some of the opera's more tender moments, most notably the Don Jose/ Micaela duet in Act I \\"Parle-moi De Ma Mere,\\" Gedda's light and lyrical voice is a perfect fit. I find the duet astounding and it could arguably be the best rendition of this work, which is due in no small part also to the beautiful voice of Andrea Guiot, who likewise gives a great solo performance in her aria \\"Je Dis, que rien ne `epouvante\\". Robert Messard as Escamillo does the job, but lacks the bravado of the confident lady-killer bullfighter he supposed to be. The orchestra and chorus under the direction of Georges Pretre perform beautifully and the smaller roles are all well cast.<br /><br />With an opera such as CARMEN, where so many great singers have performed and recorded major roles, there is stiff competition between sets. It also seems as if there isn't one perfect set. Some great Carmens have been paired with lousy casts, and some lousy Carmens have great casts. This set isn't perfect, but overall it has a certain flow to it and for me, it feels like a CARMEN should feel.tender moments, most notably the Don Jose/ Micaela duet in Act I \\"Parle-moi De Ma Mere,\\" Gedda's light and lyrical voice is a perfect fit.

0767836324|5.0|I don't understand why people dislike this movie so much. The story, in combination with the incredible score, make this a very touching movie. It is well-acted (minus Julia Roberts), and has a unique take on an old story. Who said this had to remain 100% true to the original story of Peter Pan? That gets boring. A class film that will remain one of my favorites
B000050X31|5.0|I was a little wary of buying this DVD from the negative reviews for it, but after seeing it, I have no idea where those comments were founded. I got this just so that I could see the actual performances after listening to the opera, and I was not dissapointed! This is an exceptional production of the Magic Flute, and well worth it. The orchestra is very good. Here's a character-by-character analysis: <br /> Sarastro is top rate; those low notes he is able to hit is unbelieveable! Kurt Moll is famous for this role as well. I especially like his aria and chorus of 'O Isis und Osiris'. <br /> Pamina is really excellent as well. That Kathleen Battle sure has a great set of pipes! For me, the best part for her was in chapter 35: the sorrowful aria, 'Ach, ich fuhl's, es ist verschwunden' -It gives you chills.  <br /> Tamino is great, and I like the sound of his voice. <br /> Papageno is marvelous! He was my favorite even when I just listened to a recording of the opera. He's got a great voice, and very funny. My favorite part is when he plays the magic chimes when he and Pamina are caught by the slaves. It's just fabulous! I also love the last piece where he finally gets his little Papagena. <br /> The Queen of the Night is extremely good! Someone else had said she was awful and slowed down the triples in her one famous aria, 'Der Holle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen', but I thought she was exceptional. It's one of my favorites. I have a lot of them, as you can tell. She's not screechy or anything, and it's just great. <br /> Overall I think this is a grand DVD, and I'm very happy I found it. I would highly recommend it to anybody just wanting to see a great production of Mozart's timeless opera; like I was.  <br />
B000HIVO64|3.0|Have become a big Beck fan in the last year, with Guero, Sea Change, and Odelay as favorites.  Feels like he's marching to his own drummer, which easily separates him from the me-too, over-produced, over-hyped stuff that spews out.  However, have to say that this one isn't doing it for me yet.  Don't hate it, but it doesn't stand out either.  Guero and Sea Change broke new ground.  This sounds like producers put his last 10 albums in a blender, hit puree, and spit out the results.    Two weeks later:  Have to admit that it's growing on me.  Differences from previous albums remain subtle, but still good stuff.  More production means vocals difficult to ascertain at times, but if you liked his previous work, you'll like this.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|This CD is not truly a \\"sequel\\" to Fallen.  It's something new and different.<br /><br />In short, this CD is worth a listen but departs from the sound of Fallen in several ways.  You'll get lots of hard-rock guitars, but you won't get as many haunting vocals or nuanced lyrics.<br /><br />First, some of the songs have fallen into overly-simple lyrics or guitar riffs.  The opening track, for example, consists of little more than two parts of a chorus and a \\"verse\\" in-between that itself repeats.  The guitar parts themselves have also been simplified on several tracks, so you'll get some basic sounding guitar jams in-between vocals.<br /><br />On the positive side, Amy Lee does some new things vocally, switching from a predominantly haunting and melodic sound in Fallen to more aggressive tones.  There are some lingering haunt-based lyrics, however, including Snow White Queen and Like You.  All things said, I prefer the haunting songs.<br /><br />Finally, the lyrics have changed some as well.  You won't get as many metaphor-filled, visual paintings (like on Fallen).  You'll get some, but generally many songs are more direct (\\"you only call me when you're sober\\").<br /><br />In sum, I enjoy the CD quite a lot.  However, I prefer Evanescence's prior CD Fallen for it's generally more rich vocal tones and clever lyrics.  If you are going to buy this, I suggest you first preview several of the songs on Amazon.com or another website.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|this album(and it truly is an album in the \\"old timey\\" sense of that word, ment to be listened to from start to finish) <br />is not about the music, current events in specific cases, or whether or not mr. dylan can sing like the latest pop songbird-flavor-of-the-moment. open your ears and mind and listen to the words. this is a swan song to a crumbling empire, a sweet prayer for forgiveness, a dark warning of troubled times to come, some more prayer to get along together,and a love song to mankind near the end, all set to american root based music you have heard in some form before done just for that reason   <br />so you don't get so rapped up in the tune you miss the point. pay no attention to the fact that it says there are ten songs an this album, there is basically only one message throughout. when you think \\"this\\" song  <br />is about so and so go back and listen to them again and think bigger picture. its scary, dark, and sad. written as if dylan were channeling  <br />prophesy. this is truly an album that will challenge each person that really listens in a very personal way- it sounds like it is challenging dylan personally also. he seems to know that he is in the same ship-of-humanity with us and he'll be with us, when the deal goes down. i seen in  one other reviewers statement the the lyrics could have been written be John the Revelator. he claims to be and athiest also. well, i've always claimed a little agnostic myself, but i'm back to thinking.  <br /> <br />One favorite line: the whole world is filled with speculation, the whole wide world which people say is round, they'll take your mind away from contemplation!!!  <br />bob, in that respect, you never spoke a truer truth. thanks for being there for us. <br />
B000FIMG68|5.0|There are no spoilers in this review.<br /><br />In my opinion, Season 1 focused largely on the Sci-Fi elements of the island and frequently introduced new elements to the island.  Season 2 changes to a character-development focus, though it still includes several new Sci-Fi additions.<br /><br />On the plus side, you can expect Season 2 to draw you in to the character interactions.  This not only brings fans to a deeper understanding of the plot, but also demonstrates the writers can keep this show going beyond catchy, mysterious island events.<br /><br />On the negative side, not a lot of questions are answered in Season 2 until the last several episodes.  But this isn't a huge negative, because in the mean time, as you wait for answers to questions, you'll have some new characters to meet and interesting plot developments.  And once the questions start getting answered, the answers are quite intriguing and worth the wait.<br /><br />Season 2 also introduces a new threat from a meta-plot angle: the possibility of major characters dying or disappearing from the island.  I enjoy this, but it may lead to some of your favorite characters dying.<br /><br />In summary, if you liked Season 1 you will very probably like Season 2.  And, based on what has happened so far in Season 3, it appears to be par for the course that each season of LOST will introduce some new angle on the show.  Don't wait any longer to get into the series, jump in now!
B000HIVO64|5.0|Never one to stay in one style of music for too long, Beck delivers another album full of zig-zags, twists and turns with amazing use of sound as always. This one will rank among his finest.
B00006BNDI|5.0|Whether one views him as an intentional genius, an idiot savant or even a media whore, it is hard to deny the creative legacy of Varg Vikernes and his artistic outlet, Burzum. Like a looming mountain range, shrouded in mist and legend, he has cast a dark and forboding shadow across the face, not only of black metal, but all subsequent extreme music. And, among those mountains, \\"Hvis lyset tar oss\\" stands as Everest, towering above all that came before it and dwarfing all that has passed since. <br /> <br />Metal, as a genre, has excelled beyond all modern forms of music in its passion for transcendence and its embrace of the epic spirit of the glorious past. But where most metal found the epic in grandiose gestures, pomp and circumstance, \\"Hvis lyset tar oss\\" wraps itself in the mystery of the Void, becoming metal's most sublime expression by reaching inward, into dream and memory, to find both eternal sorrow and joy in that which has been lost. <br /> <br />\\"Hvis lyset tar oss\\" is the suspension of time set to music. It is that simple. It is that complex. The infinite past is reimagined as the eternal future; the future is the endless present that never was. Nothing is hurried, nothing is forced. Four songs are stretched across 44 minutes, and while none lingers too long, all echo through the imagination long after they are finished, each unfolding naturally, in its own time. This is an album that entrances with through sheer grace; driven by deceptively simple, but gloriously beautiful melodies and harmonies whose motion is the purest of elegance, themes evolving so subtly that even the attentive listener is quickly enveloped without ever discovering quite why. <br /> <br />But the magic of \\"Hvis lyset tar oss\\" is as much about the space between sound as sound itself. The album opens with the dreamspace echoes of the intro to \\"Det som engang var,\\" perhaps the greatest single masterpiece of metal ever produced, a song built of the controlled but explosive energy oflonging and the almost unbearable weight of eternity condensed into its many contemplative pauses. It closes with the fading heartbeat and forlorn keyboard melody of \\"Tomhet,\\" a prayer offered up to the darkness within, the very essence of its sound hinting at the crushing silence of the void without. In between, the title track and \\"Inn i slottet fra drømmen\\" seethe with rage against a world that has turned away from the beauty of its past and burn with hope for a rebirth of ancient wisdom. <br /> <br />Always, \\"Hvis lyset tar oss\\" is locked in struggle. Between silence and sound, despair and hope, defeat and victory. Struggles that do not and cannot end, but form the very basis of any life worth living or universe worth living in. This is its genius, and its curse, to pose the questions and wrestle with answers that never quite come.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|It's soooo worth it. Not just for the packaging, though that's great. Some of the material on the second disc is even better than the stuff on the first. There's a remix of \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\" naturally, and what's not to like? But \\"Making A Lady\\" is going to be big on the club circuit. And \\"Almost Sorry\\" is a darkly enigmatic song of loss and mixed emotions. I had to play it over several times right away. <br /> <br />Get the 2-cd set.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Excellent sound track.All of the scores are rich and mellifulous.Also the recording quality is top notch.This is recommended to all.
B00004SZWB|5.0|There's been a lot of debate over the years as to whether this is one of Stevie's best albums or one of his worst. I suppose it depends on one's point of view but even I have to admit I was taken slightly aback when I first listened to it.<br /><br />But that was many years ago and it's grown on me, taking its rightful place as one of my favourite albums of all time. Stevie did go against a lot of what he had done before but he was just breaking new ground. I think it was a brave move on his part and personally, I think history has proved him right.<br /><br />It's a solid set of ten songs and Stevie seems to try a different idea, a different approach with each of them. This is what attracted the criticism of the album being all over the place but while it's eclectic all right, the songs all fit together. Stevie ensures they do with the way he times one song to start immediately after the end of the one before it with no break - something he's done on many of his albums.<br /><br />\\"All I Do\\" is notable for having Michael Jackson peforming background vocals, alongside Eddie Levert, Walter Williams, Jamil Raheem and Betty Wright. That might not mean anything now but this was back in 1980 just after Jackson's \\"Off The Wall\\". (Michaelmania hadn't quite taken off but it was definitely on its launch pad). The only other person who was able to snag Jackson for backing vocal duties back then (apart from Quincy Jones, that is), was Kenny Rogers, for a song on his \\"Share My World\\" album.<br /><br />\\"All I Do\\" has also been covered by many r&b singers in the intervening years but not as much as \\"Lately\\". This is easily one of Stevie's most beautiful songs and it's just him, his piano and bass synthesizer. The line \\"Lately I've been staring in the mirror\\" didn't really register until years later, when I was like, hang on, this man is blind.<br /><br />Another of my favourites is \\"Do Like You\\", a funky dance tune featuring the voices of Stevie's (then young) children, Aisha and Keita. I had this album on cassette until recently when I got the CD. The first time I heard the sound of glass breaking at the end of the song, it sounded so real, I actually looked up to see what had broken. Bizarre.<br /><br />The other songs of mention are \\"Master Blaster (Jammin')\\", which I didn't get then and still don't get now. I can see where Stevie is coming from but I really think reggae is best left to the experts.<br /><br />\\"Cash In Your Face\\" deals with the unpleasant but undenialble issue of racism. The song tells the story of a young black family man looking for an apartment and being stonewalled by the landlord or real estate agent. The prospective tenant's voice is pleading and desperate, while the landlord's is cold and unmoving. I'd been listening to the album for several months before I realised that Stevie was singing both parts - one an octave lower than the other. Brilliant.<br /><br />And then, finally, there's \\"Happy Birthday\\" and the only use I've found for it over the years is, as a DJ, playing it at birthday parties and getting the guests to dance around the celebrant. It works a treat every time. That said, this song was the vocalisation of the campaign Stevie started to get Martin Luther King, Jr's birthday recognised. Given that it's now a public holiday in the US, I'd say that all on its own makes this entire album pretty iconic. I'm not sure it's his best; \\"Songs In The Key Of Life\\" wins that honour hands down, but it's definitely (one of) his most culturally influential.il recently when I got the CD.

0375703764|1.0|This book really cracked me up.  You really have to have the right sense of humor to enjoy House of Leaves, one of the most amazing literary practical jokes ever written.  It is touted as a horrifying tale of terror and mystery, but there within lies the joke.  Danielewski will have you decoding letters, reading footnotes 3 pages long, and staring at evidence within multiple appendecies.  If you make it through to the end, you are in for a treat!  Turns out this book is a comedy, NOT a horror story, so horror lovers, you may want to skip this one.  Danielewski has you hunting for a terror that quite certainly does not exist within these pages.  You will, however, find entertainment in the fact that you have just read a novel about a book put together by a crazed tattoo artist about notes written down by a blind guy on a documentary that may or may not actually exist.
B000HIVO64|5.0|This album is very, very good. Some words to describe the information would be...addictive, nice, dancable, beautiful, and just enjoyable. Its in true Beck fashion in that I think it sounds different than any of his others. One thing I LOVE about Beck is that every cd sounds different. This one is from beginning to end just amazing. I can't think of a better word right now to describe it except for amazing. Some of my very favorite songs are elevator music(a great way to start an album) and especially strange apperition and no complaints. Plus, the videos on the dvd are great...it's really all around wonderful, without me exaggerating. Buy it if you love Beck, and know it doesn't sound like any of his others.:)
B0000AZKPC|5.0|Well, there is nothing more to say (other reviews have described this album and its music quite accurately) - this band is totally incredible, the blend of beauty and iciness is enchanting.  If you are new to this type of band, do not worry, I will share brief information about their sound and music experience.    First of all, they are a Power-Metal band with no equal whatsoever; they are from Finland, this makes their sound quite magical and attractive; do not be fooled, although the sound is fantasy-bent, the lyrics are themes of reality (90% of them: war, sadness, the missing of someone or something, sin outcomes, lunacy, cause and effect, among others in a unique and odd manner); the singer provides a strange yet captivating voice, he is truly feeling what has been written (the accent makes it the most interesting); the rest of the band just provides you with a series of scenarios that are genuinely convincing; with this said, prepare yourself for a regal and mythical journey.  This album contains 10 unparallel tracks:  1) Blank File - a fast paced opener with an ecstatic feeling to it (it talks about technology and how it can affect a person's life if used in an addictive way).  I give this one an A.  2) My Land - a mid paced song that may perhaps trigger your reflective senses (perhaps it talks about how time can change a place you grew in and cherished, how time and ambitions can fortify or corrupt that special place).  It is a decent song with a slight patriotic sound to it.  I give it a B.  3) 8th Commandment - just as the first track, a more mystifying fast paced one.  Only in this case there is a sense of anger as it describes the consequences of lying.  I give this solid piece an A.  4) Replica - another mid paced song, but with drama.  Here you have the traumatic effects of war; somehow you can feel those effects with the song's sound of heroism, burden, and indirect regret.  I give this special song a B+.  5) Kingdom for a Heart - this is one of my favorite songs right here.  It is emotional, but it keeps its edge.  Here you have the yearning of love, but it is impossible to achieve.  It is a masterpiece even though the writer himself did not like it that much.  I give it an A.  6) Fullmoon - here you have a song that is 50% real and 50% myth.  It talks about a troubled romance due to a man's curse (he becomes a werewolf), of course, that is my opinion.  I give this mid paced sound of tragedy an A (the chorus are very catchy, that is an element that greatly distinguishes this band).  7) Letter to Dana - I really love this power ballad, it is that zealous and melancholic alike.  It talks about the missing of a person; there are other sub-themes in there too.  Some say this song is all that greasy, but the invocation of depression in a sweet way is there.  I give this cookie an A (listen to Shy if you have the chance - the sequel is as better, if listened together it will not disappoint).  8) Unopened - the infamous what if theme, another favorite right here.  This song returns back to fast pace, almost Victorian sounding; it is that fun to listen.  I give this overacted sounding (it has its reasons to sound such way) an A.  9) Picturing the Past - another favorite of mine, this is fast paced also.  It talks about a past regarding prostitution I think.  The sound is intense and torment-bent, it will not let you down.  I give this striking opus an A.  10) Destruction Preventer - this song is absolutely awesome; it is a bit long, but the ferocity and cold ambience mixture is rewarding to the listener.  Its talks about the fall of nature (mankind as well) due to military advanced weaponry - it is as the rest of the songs, earcandy.  I give this closer a B+.   In the end, I give this entire album a 3.7 which is a deserving A (highly recommended).  This album was Sonata Arctica's first album and I have to admit, the put sacrifice into it for in my view it remains their best album so far.  Please, if you are deeply centered within Death-Metal and Nu-Metal (which some bands sound great), and Metal music related with the first two mentioned, I suggest not to gain this album.  Again, if you want new experiences and are familiar with Power-Metal, Fantasy sounds, etc. - then I strongly suggest to feel free and gain this wonderful album, it will remain with you for a long, long time.  Thanks for having time to read this review and analyzing it.    Suggested bands: Nightwish, Blind Guardian, Amberian Dawn, Iced Earth, Stratovarius, Kamelot, etc.  I also suggest every Sonata Arctica CD, each has such unique approach.
B000001FOL|4.0|But so what!? This is an album of classics. Having known Nico from the now legendary first Velvet Underground LP and some tracks in the Royal Tenenbaums I came across the CD and finally decide to buy it. And it didn't let me down. The overall atmosphere is eerie but coherent, which is remarkable considering the songs were written by different people. Highlists are the first two tracks by Jackson Browne and the VU classic 'Chelsea Girls'. Maybe not the most 'open' record ever made, but worth getting for the music fan.
B00005214X|5.0|Only 5 stars?? One of the most unacknowledged musicians in one of his finest works.
B000GBEWHA|4.0|I returned two of these discs thinking they were defective, before I realized that the sing-along feature just doesn't work on many DVD players.  I was finally able to get it to work on my Humax Tivo DVD player/recorder, but when I had tried to play it on my Phillips and Toshiba machines, the songs would be skipped over completely during movie playback, and random lines of the songs were skipped during playback of specific sing-along tracks.  Also, no lyrics would show up at all.  I was very bummed since this was the only reason I purchased this new edition.
B000FIMG68|3.0|For some reason the copies of this season I got from Netflix default to showing the English captions. Even though it's set to None on the menu, the captions appear unless I select None myself for every single episode. Very annoying. <br /> <br />The content itself is very cheesy but of course it's addictive, so I guess I'm stuck with it.
006056251X|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite romance novel of all time. Though the spine of the story, a reformed rake by the virgin, is nothing of an original, it is very witty and humorous. I found myself laughing on many scenes and the chemistry between them is quite refreshing. Don't miss out on this great book if you love romance.
087788630X|5.0|One of the best books I have read. <br /> <br />Chesterton wrote a masterpiece.  He thought about things in unique ways which makes his writing extremely insightful.  And furthermore, his writing is exciting.  It goes beyond simple communication to conveyance of truth--a rare gift.
B000005HNQ|4.0|The Gathering really opened my eyes by what the band had brought to the table with Mandylion. It was just so strong in so many ways it was scary. Aneeke's beautiful voice floated above the riffage below creating a amazing vibe or atmosphere.<br /><br />Although they have gotten away from their heavier side with each subsequent release, Nighttime Birds has still got those magical moments in it. It's not as heavy as Mandylion was and they haven't been that heavy in some time now, but Birds is pretty decent cd overall and recommended by this metalhead.
B000002H6C|4.0|THE BAND: James Hetfield (lead vocals, guitar), Kirk Hammett (guitars), Lars Ulrich (drums & percussion), and new member Jason Newsted (bass) formerly of Flotsam And Jetsam (replacing Cliff Burton, R.I.P.).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1988) 9 tracks clocking in at approximately 65 minutes. Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, band pictures, one 'gavel' drawing containing  band member faces, and thank you's. This is Metallica's 4th studio album. All songs written by Hetfield, Hammett, Ulrich and/or Newsted. Recorded at One On One Studios, Los Angeles, CA. This would be Flemming Rasmussen's last album produced with the band (Bob Rock would follow). The Japanese (import) version contains a bonus track - a Diamond Head cover, \\"The Prince\\". Label - Elektra.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"...And Justice For All\\" was the last classic Metallica album of the 80's. It was also their final attempt at thrash metal (once the 90's rolled around and producer Bob Rock entered the picture, the band took a more \\"mainstream\\" metal approach). The majority of songs are long with complex riffs... borderline progressive. Let me first say that for years, this disc sat on my shelf. I thought it was over-produced; I didn't like Ulrich's snare drum (sounded cheap and tinny) or his double bass (sounded shallow and metallic - partly due to a coin taped to the drum skin where the foot pedal hit); Newsted's bass was nonexistent (the standard explanation for this combines Newsted's absence from the mixing sessions where he could have voiced his opinion, and the lingering issue of his \\"newness\\" within the band following the death of Burton); there were three songs that I just could not get into (\\"Eye Of The Beholder\\", \\"The Shortest Straw\\" and lightning fast \\"Dyers Eve\\"); and the articles I read about the 3 original band members hazing and not accepting newcomer Newsted was infuriating... call if fun, call it pranks, call it cruel - Newsted simply did not deserve this kind of treatment. Newsted (or anyone else who took the job) had two choices - put up with the crap or leave. From the outside looking in, Burton's loss was tragic, but the way Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammett handled the situation afterwards seemed uncalled for. As far as \\"...And Justice For All\\" is concerned though, it's taken a decade to grow on me and finally realize there are some brilliant songs here. In my opinion, \\"One\\" is one of Metallica's finest songs in their entire catalog. \\"One\\" has an awesome slow beginning, tells a great story of an injured soldier, and ends in fine metal thrash form (not to mention one of the more memorable MTV videos)... all in all featuring great guitar work (intro, rhythm and solos). \\"Blackened\\" is an underrated gem of an opener. \\"To Live Is To Die\\" is the other masterpiece (almost 10 minutes long) - riffs and spoken words written by Cliff Burton (his last written testament) - this song has great riffs and 7 minutes of jamming before any vocals... reminiscent of something taken right off \\"Master Of Puppets\\". The title track also resembles something from \\"Puppets\\". \\"...And Justice For All\\" chart success - hitting #6 on Billboard's \\"Top 200 Albums\\" from 1988, as well as the song \\"One\\" hitting #35 on Billboard's Hot 100. There's good and bad here... this album is still considered a classic and essential. If not only for the songs \\"One\\", \\"Blackened\\" and \\"To Live Is To Die\\" (4 stars).reatment.

B0000025YM|4.0|I remember when this first came out in early 1984.  I was in my heavy metal heyday then - mostly with the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, but also with Anvil from Canada, Black Sabbath with Ian Gillan on vocals and this new band called Metallica... <br /> <br />From the first track, \\"Freewheel Burning\\", it was obvious that Judas Priest had been observing the nascent \\"speed metal\\" form.  This one really did burn, and to this day, \\"FB\\" and \\"The Sentinel\\" are among my favourite Priest songs. <br /> <br />\\"The Sentinel\\"!  Truly epic.  Rob Halford shows how good he is as a storyteller, the song is crunching and heavy, and Glenn Tipton and KK Downing trade off solos in trademark fashion.  I hope this always remains in their live set. <br /> <br />There's some other good stuff too, but also some weaker material.  \\"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\\" is a too-obvious calculated attempt to replicate \\"Living After Midnight\\" and \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\\".  \\"Night Comes Down\\" - well, I just don't like this band showing vulnerability!  \\"Heavy Duty/Defenders Of The Faith\\" - 22 years on, to this 40 year old, just kind of sounds silly (Halford in his early stages of attempting to write \\"rock anthems\\"), but in 1984 to an 18 year old, was pretty cool! <br /> <br />Halford is in fine form vocally, Tipton and Downing are crunchy and almost telepathic in their guitar interplay, you can occasionally hear Ian Hill...but Dave Holland is one of the most bog-awful drummers I've ever heard in the heavy metal genre!  Here it's not even his normal \\"boxy\\" sound; it's more techy, mid-'80s Simmons drums (remember those?) though not nearly as bad as on the next album \\"Turbo\\".  They were foolish to lose Les Binks and wise to get Scott Travis. <br /> <br />Not perfect, but still an essential part of the soundtrack to my misspent youth.
B000AADYYO|5.0|From start to finish, this is an excellent album.  It combines all kinds of genres into a mixer and pushes the \\"HIGH\\" button!!  All instruments are played with ferocity and technical expertise.  Probably the most complex band in the history of rock.  Its originality knows no end.  BUY! BUY! BUY!  You'll regret it if you don't!
B000F8O4E0|4.0|I had a lot of fun with my vinyl copy of this album when I'd get into arguements with people as to whether or not backward masking was used on records.  I'd plop this record down on the turntable and run the \\"Fire on High\\" track backwards and you'd clearly hear \\"The music is reversible, but time is not...turn back...turn back...turn back.\\"  Also, at the beginning of the song Down Home Town they've got \\"Face the mighty waterfall\\" backward masked into the intro.<br /><br />I won't repeat what everyone else wrote.  I think most of us know where this album fits into the history of ELO and what the songs are like, but what we're wondering is whether or not to pony up the money to but another copy of it.<br /><br />Well, I listened to this version through my computer on nice Sennheiser headphones and I can't tell where the improvement in sound happened.  Perhaps I can hear it on some of the quieter passages.<br /><br />However, I can say that the \\"stripped down\\" Evil Woman is very cool, especially with the additional verse that isn't on the original.  Also, the Waterfall instrumental is great.  The \\"strange magic\\" single edit is the same truncated and out-of-context version that I got rather sick of when it was played on the radio all the time.  The alternative version of Fire on High sounds like the intro to an old Twilight Zone episode only it goes on and on and on.  It was interesting but I'll probably skip it next time I listen to this CD.<br /><br />So, should you but this again?  Sure, there's just enough here to warrent spending the money.  Of course, if you don't own it in any form then here's your chance to get a truly great 1970's progressive power-pop period piece that you'll find to be a lot of fun.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Earlier this year, I discovered Evanescence's previous albums. One of them, Origin, I believe it wasn't released under a label, is one of my favorite albums ever. So, during the Summer, when I heard that Evanescence was coming out with a new album, I was stoked. But it turns out that the album wasn't what I expected. It's a lot more defiant rage than sweet sadness. The songs on their previous albums were haunting. Amy Lee lamenting a lost love, succumbing to darkness and then being reborn again... it's a lot more heartbreaking than what she's wrote here. I admit, I miss Ben Moody's writing, though they tend to be quite suicidal at times. Despite this, though, The Open Door is a fun ride. I guess it is enjoyable to see Amy Lee overcome her trials.  <br /> <br />I guess what she's trying to tell us in this album is, I used to be sad and suicidal but here I am alive and kicking. As she sings in, \\"Weight of the World\\"- \\"I won't be held down by who I used to be.\\" <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Evanescence, you should buy it, for Amy Lee's voice alone. But if you're just getting into the band, I suggest that you start with Fallen or Origin. This album is a lot more experimental than the other two. <br /> <br />The best two songs on this album, in my opinion, are \\"Good Enough\\" and \\"Lithium.\\" The rest are pretty good, but it all starts to get pretty repetitive. <br /> <br />And on a side note... I know that a lot of people dislike \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" but I've actually begun to like it. It has to grow on you, people. Give it time.
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|I remember when this album was new.  I was in the University District in Seattle and I walked into the U of W bookstore and they were playing this record and cranking it up through the store sound system.  I was hooked.  I bought it and then ended up buying all the ELO I could get my hands on.  This album made me an ELO fan.<br /><br />Anyway, I'll spare the track-by-track description here and just give you the low-down on what's going on with this new remastered-with-bonus-stuff release of this 1970's power-pop classic.<br /><br />First, I this is the third of the new re-mastered ELO CDs that I've listened to within the past week (the others being Face the Music and On the Third Day) and I must say that this one is the best.  The re-mastering process gave this record the mid-high to high-end detail that we missed in the old vinyl days, so there's a good bit of detail for you to hear on this release that you may have never heard before.  Be sure to listen with high quality equipment and punch up the mid-high with your tone control or equalizer.<br /><br />Second, the bonus tracks here are the best of any ELO re-release in my opinion.  The alternative version of Telephone Line is a great way to hear the song all over again, this time with the vocals up front insteat of sounding like they were \\"phoned in\\", which I think was the point of the original version.<br /><br />Surrender is a very fitting track as it is catchy and fun and could have been right at home on the original version of this album.  It might have been a good change of pace, actually.<br /><br />The \\"rough mix\\" instrumentals aren't that rough at all, they are beautiful and fascinating in their own right.  Crank and enjoy!<br /><br />Finally, why is this album considered so \\"old\\" anyway?  Since when does great music get \\"old\\"?  I recently went to see the \\"Beach Boys\\" (the touring act with Mike Love) and Bo Diddley (he's 77) and people of all ages and three generations were at both concerts having a wonderful time.  Maybe there is a young person in your life who needs to be exposed to this stuff.  How about playing it for your son or daughter and seeing what happens?  Maybe it's an \\"old world record\\" to us, but it just might really be a New World Record to them.having a wonderful time.

0553288105|2.0|I frankly cannot believe it won both Hugo and Nebula awards. <br />Terribly boring with stereotypical charcters. Even the aliens whose eating, living, mating, and reproducing habits are completely different from humans, seemed to have emotional and psychological habits remarkably like humans.   <br />This is the second book I read of Asimov, and both times, I wondered what the point was to put incredibly typical and mundane characters in an extraordinary situation and make them think and say very ordinary things. Maybe it was newish back in the 70s, I don't know. <br />But the alien life in Part 2, was enjoyable, kind of cute, and fun to read. In order to understand Part 2, you would need to go through Part 1. And if you've read until the end of Part 2, you might as well read it until the end. In that sense, it is a fairly readable book. <br />
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Corinne Bailey Rae's debut album serves to showcase a fresh new talent, and not only does she have a great voice, but she writes the songs, plays the guitars, bass, percussion, piano, organ and whatever else have you.  The multi-faceted Jill-of-all-trades adds her own bluesy spin to each track, and with the minimal backing music you get to hear every word and inflection.<br /><br />The first single from the album is \\"Like a Star\\", and the lyrics set the tone of the album: \\"Just like a star across my sky / Just like an angel off the page / You have appeared to my life / Feel like I'll never be the same\\".  The best track is the second single \\"Put Your Records On\\" which needs to further introduction, the next being \\"Trouble Sleeping\\" which won't happen to you if you play this late at night after a hard day's work.<br /><br />Fans of Norah Jones and Katie Melua should like this one, and though it's too dreamy and languid for the taste of this barbaric Philistine, it's a standout for the genre.  Ideal music for relaxing with close friends and a good bottle of wine, especially if your friends provide the vino.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 11, 2006

B000I0QL82|5.0|I just finished watching the newly released Special Edition of Holiday Inn. I was AMAZED at the clarity of the picture. I've never seen a print of this film looking so pristine. Even on just a regular, 20\\" non-HDTV set, the hairs askew on top of Bing's toupee during the famous White Christmas scene are plainly visible. Now if you can see single hairs on a person's head during a medium shot on a small television set, that's a stunningly clear picture!  <br /> <br />The audio as well is crisp and clear with rich bass and treble tones. If you watch the film with the audio commentary on, you'll hear the dulcet tones of Ken Barnes relating some fascinating tidbits about the making of the film, the songs (one particularly interesting part concerns the verse to White Christmas), the cast, etc. All is enhanced by sound bites from Bing and Fred Astaire themselves in archive audio material from the 1970's. As an example, Bing speaks of the continuing sales of his recording of White Christmas as late as 1974, how he felt it was due in part to people giving the record as a Christmas gift. <br /> <br />The real gems are the bonus features, particularly the 45 minute long mini feature A Couple of Song & Dance Men. Ken Barnes is joined by Fred Astaire's lovely daughter Ava sharing biographical memories of both Bing and Fred, along with trivia tidbits. Ava shows and reads some of the letters Fred Astaire wrote to his wife while on a USO tour in England with Bing in 1944, and telegrams to Fred from Bing, Cole Porter, and Irving Berlin are also shown on screen. All is pieced together nicely with song excerpts from Bing's films, coming attractions trailers, and newsreel footage, including Bing opening the Stage Door Canteen in 1944.  <br /> <br />The other, shorter bonus feature runs 7 minutes and is titled All Singing - All Dancing. Ken shares some rare behind the scenes photos and techniques of how musical numbers were filmed, beginning with the early talkies. He shows how the orchestra and singer were together on the set and recorded as one. <br /> <br />The original theatrical trailer for Holiday Inn is also included. <br /> <br />All is wrapped up nicely with a slip-cover that goes over the DVD case. When compared with the two-on-one DVD of Holiday Inn and Going My Way that's been out for many years now, the difference in quality is plainly visible. The Holiday Inn print looks somewhat fuzzy or \\"muddy\\" in quality when watched after seeing the brilliance of the newly restored print used on this Special Edition.  <br /> <br />In short, this is a DVD that's well worth having. If you want the definitive presentation of this classic Holiday film, this is it! Bravo Ken & co.
B000HCO840|1.0|I am quite pissed at Fox for this edition. I mean, up until now, there was a clear difference between standard editions and collector's editions, or so I thought... I used to believe that a collector's edition included all the extra bonus features one has the right to expect when he or she pays extra for it, especially for a movie like X-Men, no questions asked. I was obviously wrong, and I was charged with $20+ to learn that lesson.  It appears now that it has changed, with Fox at least, whose marketing guys use shameless tricks to get the cash. DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION! IT HAS ZERO BONUS FEATURE AND THE DVD IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE REGULAR CHEAPER ONE! It only contains a \\"exclusive\\" comic book that is rather crappy, and has no interest whatsoever. Either you do not care for bonuses, and in that case, get the widescreen edition, or you are an afficionado, and if so, do not make the same mistake I made: check out in details the description of the dvd before you buy anything. Again, this is NOT a collector's edition, and you can see miles away that the actual special edition or whatever they're gonna name it is coming up in no time. And remember that from now on, a collector's edition by Fox has no meaning at all! Shame on Fox! They can no longer be trusted!
B000HCO83Q|3.0|Well I have been told this follows the comic book storyline. To bad. It is worth seeing but it lacks any of the fun that I saw in the first two movies. There is no lighthearted times in this movie. Usually in a trilogy the second movie is dark and the third movie starts that way but has a happy ending. There is no happy ending here, just a feeling of emptiness and loss. Is the action, effects, and story good? Yes they are in fact. So as I said before if you have caught the previous ones you will want to see it. However; this is not a standalone movie and won't make much sense without seeing the previous movies. Fans of the first two movies may be disappointed in the deaths of three key characters. If they had not killed off these characters and had a happier ending I think I know I would have enjoyed it more. And by the way the alternate endings are a joke. They are minor scene changes that were deleted, not a change to the ending itself. I was extremely disappointed that the alternate endings as they call them didn't have different outcomes. Preferably one that didn't kill off the characters. My guess is they had so many people disppointed in the movie they felt the only way to sell the DVD was to make people think they had alternate endings. I repeat there are no alternate endings on this DVD. It is just a ploy. So if you saw this at the theater and were disappointed, do not buy the DVD. It doesn't get any better.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Off The Wall is is the epitome of \\"being in the right place at the right time\\". This album was released just as Disco was morphing into the \\"Dance Pop\\" of the 80's, and Michael with the producer Quincy Jones delivered songs with just the right balance.<br /><br />Michael was also leaving his \\"teenybop\\" image behind, and people were not only willing to see him as an adult, they embraced it.  Don't Stop \\"Til You Get Enough, Rock With You, Working Day and Night, Off The Wall and Burn This Disco Out were all up to the minute, Dance/Pop confections with just enough R & B mixed in.<br /><br />Quincy can sometimes overproduce, but not here, the tracks have a clean feel, and Michael's diverse vocals are allowed to shine.  Some of these stylings were heard on the Jackson's album, Destiny, but here Michael is able to take it to the next level.<br /><br />Michael also updated his ability to deliver a ballad, and the standout here is She's Out of My Life. he delivers this song with just the right amount of emotion, and injects enough restraint to avoid going over into<br /><br />lounge singer territory.<br /><br />It is also worth noting that Michael seemed to be at a very happy and content point in his life (that sadly would not last).  Michael's later work would slowly turn toward a darker side, Off The Wall would be the most upbeat of his solo work.<br /><br />Ken
B000HT386M|4.0|As the Amzaon reviewer has pointed out there is definitely a similar theme to a life lesson in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", but that is as far as it goes. The movies are totally different. This movie starts out as a comedy but then becomes darker as the drama kicks in on how life passes us by if we dont' take the time to embrace it. To many double income families know only full well the difficulties in balancing careers and family. Adam Sandler fans should definitely like it, especially if they enjoyed the less light \\"50 First Dates\\". Sandler likes to poke some fun and try to show us to appreciate our loved ones and friends.<br /><br />In \\"Click\\" he plays an overworked architect that finds it hard to keep up with his job and still find time for his family. When he can't even figure out what controls the TV, fan, or garage door opener he visits Bed, Bath, and Beyond. When he finds there is much more to the place than meets the eye he finds that an angel played by Christopher Walken has the solution to all his problems. A remote that controls his universe. Only one problem, the remote is a smart remote and remembers his choices so that it may automatically make them again. I'm a fan of Adam Sandler, so I enjoyed the movie. Some may be disappointed since it isn't all comedy, but it does have a happy ending like all Sandler's movies.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Evanescence have finally delivered a follow-up to their hugely successful debut album `Fallen'...so the question remains...'how does it stack up?'  `Sweet Sacrifice' opens the album off with a bang, crushing guitars and pounding drums coupled with Amy's brilliant vocals let us all know that this is exactly what we've been waiting for.  `Call Me When You're Sober' is actually a really good song, as much as I hate the title.  The song is about her struggle through her relationship with Seether frontman.  `Weight of the World' is a great commanding track, heavy and Amy shines here, but it can't even hold a candle to `Lithium' which is by far my favorite track here.  Starting with piano and building into one of the most engaging ballads I've ever heard, Evanescence goes all out with this one.  `Cloud Nine' stands out to me, starting with those great background chants that sound like they belong in a horror movie and bursting forward with crushing guitars and harsh lyrics.  `Snow White Queen' is pretty decent...the versus are much better than the chorus which falls a little generic.  `Lacrymosa' is another brilliant song which opens very subtle and almost eerie and then just gets better, playing on the best assets of this band and creating a mood with a masterpiece.  `Like You' is a beautiful ballad that really shows off Amy's beautiful voice.  `Lose Control' is one of my favorites where Amy gets a little freaky and very edgy.  It's a good sound for her.  `The Only One' and `Your Star' are great general Evanescence tracks, as is `All That I'm Living For' but it's the closer `Good Enough' that really gets to me.  It's just so subtle and elegant, stripped down and raw and oozing forth with utter brilliance.  Sophomore slump this is not, for Evanescence have returned with just as much energy and creativity they made good for on their debut.  Can't wait for the next installment.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I, like Beck as he wrote this album, recently seperated from my girlfriend. As most people know this can be extremely depressing and heart wrenching. And although i don't give all the credit to this album, it deserves a lot for helping me get through it. The album is a work of art even if you're not experiencing a break up. But if you are, you will truly connect with Beck and what he's trying to convey. Some of his lyrics made me feel like we shared the exact same emotions when thinking of our failed relationships. It's very comforting to be honest. You can hear the depression and hopelessness in his voice. His whole world must have been shattered when he split with his girl. Every song on this album is brilliant. The Golden Age, Paper Tiger, Guess im Doing fine, Lost Cause, Lonesome teas and Around the Bend are true standouts. One of my all time favorite albums, a real masterpiece of sadness.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's... If you haven't seen it, then you must have heard of it in some way. You have heard the title somewhere, you read about it at someplace or maybe you have heard the famous musical theme by Henry Mancini? Yes, it's hard not to have heard of this classic masterpiece in some sort of way.    The film is mostly known because of the wonderfully charming performance by Audrey Hepburn. She is indeed the element that still keeps the film alive and away from \\"being forgotten\\" by younger generations 45 years after it's original release in the thearters. Now, that is the power Hepburn has, entertaining you endlessly even if you are watching this film for the 100th time.   Hepburn alone can be a reason to buy this film.  Next to Hepburn is the cool, also charming, George Peppard in a role that has also made this an absolute classic film. He and Hepburn are one of the best onscreen couples I have ever seen! The chemistry is maqnificent and gives a great feeling of enjoyment.   So the acting is of the best way possible and keeps you entertainted till the screen turns black at the very end of the film.    The rest of the film is absolutely fine and professionally done. Great directing from legend Blake Edwards (the man behind the Pink Panter series), absolutely wonderfull and enchanting music by Henri Mancini that lifts up every scene, great setdesign and good lighting. Another thing not to be forgotten is the costumdesign. Fantastic clothing makes Hepburn even more enchanting than she already is and George Peppard looks like a fine gentleman in his suits.    Being a funny comedy, Breakfast at Tiffany's also has some great dramatic moments. The best thing about these dramatic moments is that the actors are totally believable in how they react to each other and feel by one another. The expressions on George Peppard's face as he experiences something is absolutely fantastic. Then of course there is Audrey Hepburn, simply one of the best actresses ever, who gives an absolutely unforgettable performance that grabs you. One look in her eyes at those dramatic moments (or at any other moment) and you're sold.    From the story (written by Truman Capote) to the music, from the acting to the clothing, from Hepburn's hair to Hepburn's toes: everything in this film is absolutely classic and enjoyable. My guess is that this film will be everylasting. In another 45 years, people will still be talking about this film and will still be charmed by it's absolutely delicious character.   If you are a fan of romantic comedies or great classic movies and you haven't this one yet, all I can say is this: you are in for a maqnificently pleasing experience you will always remember.   Enjoy.
B000GY729M|3.0|Let me start by saying that I bought this disc the DAY it came out.  I have been anticipating it for a while now since I LOVED Hot Fuss, and had gotten to see them play live. <br />I wanted to wait a while to review this new cd to gather my thoughts on how I really feel about this disc, and to give it a fair shake.  I had read some of the bad previews of it(Rolling Stone's)as 1 example, but I dont usually care too much for critics.  Anyway, my first listen to Sam's Town, I was impressed, didnt love it, but i was impressed by depth of their new sound.  Second listen, I thought it's almost like Brandon is SHOUTING his vocals, like really overdoing it. <br />The 3'd listen I found myself just really thinking that they just over did the WHOLE thing. <br />I see the direction they were going after, and that must be commended, but as much as I loved Hot Fuss, Sam's Town does not find me going back for repeat listens. <br />This album does have some stand-out moments, dont get me wrong, but all in all I think it sounds over done, over-sung, over produced, and a little boring. <br />
B0006J28L4|5.0|This movie is great and white people all around the world should be forced to see it in school. Prefferably while they are still children, that way they won't have time to be persuaded by ignorant, conservative, racists like K. Tarin, a racist reviewer who wrote an article on this same page. Anybody who isn't a racist loves this movie.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|If like me, you expect another Fallen, most likely you'll be dissapointed with this album.  However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the album is bad in itself.  After all, musical taste is a subjective matter and so far most people here seem to have enjoyed The Open Door. <br />There isn't much of a drastic change, as we still have Amy's lovely voice soaring through the pounding guitar riffs.  However, you can immediately notice the change in the guitar accompaniment and will possibly hear similarities with most of the songs.  On the first listen, it seems that the cd drags along and doesn't have much to say.  On the second, some of the melodies begin to catch on, others you may become indifferent to.  On the third, you may find yourself singing along to some of the tracks.  By the fourth listen, or possibly even the second you may already have a favorite track here and there.  I suspect that my not reading along to the lyrics may have contributed to my dislike for the album at first.  Therefore, I strongly suggest that when and if you do purchase the cd, that you read the lyrics as the song plays.  Doing so, will add a whole lot more dimension to the music and meaning. <br />As with all albums, certain tracks stand out more than others.  In the Open Door those tracks are Sweet Sacrifice, Lithium, Cloud Nine, Like You, Lose Control, The Only One, and Your Star. Some tracks contain a Fallen-esque quality too, such as Lithium, The Only One, and Your Star. <br />I definitely recommend this new work by Evanescence, just try not to expect another Fallen or you'll be sorely dissapointed. Where Fallen was very dark and brooding with catchy pop melodies, The Open Door delivers with more dimension and personality. As such, it takes longer to understand and become accustomed to. <br />  <br /> <br />   <br />
B00020HEG6|5.0|Everyone has songs that they listen to when they want to escape the outside world.  To go to a sactuary that has never been seen of, or heard of, by anyone else but you. When you listen to the songs on these tracks, it is like you are looking over a hill. The sky is grey, and it is quite windy.  You can see the grass waving in the wind.  Everyone would want to escape to a place like this, a place that they can retreat to when feeling sad, or lonely.  That is why you should buy this.  So that you can go to your own sactuary.
B000094DUP|5.0|I first heard her music as part of the TV show \\"Amazing Race 7 final promo\\".  They used \\"Lost Without You\\"  I enjoyed the song and was surprized she wasn't available in the US except through import.  Innocent eyes is an excellent album and Delta is a great talent.  I think she will take America by storm with the proper exposure.
B000050XEI|5.0|While most reviews here are agreeing, I've read a few others that diminish this work of A Day Without Rain. I say, that unless you are detached from your Heart energy element within, you will find one of the best pieces of musical work and melody here from Enya. Very spiritual in some qualities, and one of her best releases in my experience of listening.
B00006BNDI|5.0|Besides all the church burning and killing Burzum actually did some good music to brag about with Hvis Lysset Tar Oss. This is actually one of the best albums to come out of the Norwegian black metal scene. Beginning with the cold and harsh drumming of Det Som En Gang Var the album leads you to a trip through snow covered landscapes resembling the black and white illustration of the artwork. This is no happy music you know... Varg delivers his vocals with such ferocity that no other singer can match. The song patterns, while primitive and repetitive hold an intelligence to them as they are simple but full of meaning. The 4 tracks that range to about an hour are full of cold black metal riffing and Varg's wolflike screams with the last song being the exception. Tomhet which is Norwegian for Empty does exactly that, it empties you with it's repetitive ambient structure. While not up to par with most ambient artists out there it sure leaves you with a nice feeling. People who want to experience all that is black metal be sure to check this album. You won't regret it...
B000GY729M|5.0|I have listened through the 40+ minute Sam's Town album 5-6 times and each time it gets better. I wanted to give it a good listen through in order to be able to accurately review it.  <br /> <br />I have read several professional reviews (and amatuer ones) that want to bring Springsteen comparisons. I, frankly, don't get that. Maybe they are referring to the lyrical imagery of the roads, small towns--the image of America, which is so prominent in this album versus the Brit-inspired sound of Hot Fuss. Other than that, The Killers are very different and original.  <br /> <br />The album opens with Sam's Town. It is a great opener with a short drum roll, and right into some very strong vocals, guitars, and percussion. I could see this being a single. It has a strong sense of patriotic imagery with lyrics like \\"Red white and blue upon a birthday cake, And my brother, he was born on the fourth of the July...\\"  Flowers even seems to take a stab at the critics--though maybe only coincidental--when he says \\"And I am sick of all my judges.\\"  <br /> <br />The next track, Enterlude, is questionable at best. It is a 48-second acoustic track that appears to be more of a gimic track than an actual song. The Exitlude track at the end is just as questionable, though it does add a little bit more with background vocals and some percussion. To me, a $11.00 album should never have songs under 2-3 minutes. These two tracks are unique, nonetheless, and are in sync with The Killers' overall style. <br /> <br />When You Were Young is the safe first single. I actually think Sam's Town, Bling (Confession of a King), and Bones would have been better, more unique first singles. The guitars are strong throughout, overwhelming all other instruments, with the exception of the use of some synthesizer. Very good commercial song, not that much unlike Hot Fuss' Somebody Told Me. <br /> <br />Bling (Confession of a King), is one of my favorites of the new album and I think one that is overlooked quite a bit. Flowers starts with basically an acoutic-synthesizer intro and it goes right into fast paced guitar and drums. The guitar hook in the chorus is quite addicting and the song is just a real standout and pure Killers.  <br /> <br />For Reasons Unknown is a strong song--what some may consider filler between the top songs on the album--but what I consider a great song nonetheless. It appears to be about lost love and is one of the few \\"love songs\\" on the album. Again, Flowers starts in a slow, deliberate acoustic manner, and it quickly shifts to a fast-paced song.  <br /> <br />Read My Mind is an okay song, nothing spectacular. It is basically the \\"other love song\\". With lyrics like \\"Breakin' out of this two-star town...\\" you can tell it is kind of a \\"go your own seperate ways\\" song.  <br /> <br />Uncle Jonny is a stand-out song on the album and cleverly original. How can it not be a good song with an opening of \\"When everybody else refrained, My uncle Johnny did cocaine\\"? It actually reminded me of a song maybe Tom Petty would have done in the '80's. It has some very good instrumentation and vocals. <br /> <br />Bones is supposed to be the second single. I don't agree with that, but I do agree it is a great song. Instead of it being a \\"love song\\", it is a \\"lust song\\". With lyrics describing bones rubbing against bones, you can clearly see their intention. The vocals are some of the best as is the instrument playing. Definate hit! <br /> <br />My List is not one of my favorites. It does have a tendency (after multiple listenings) of sounding like some of the other songs on the album and is just not unique enough. It's not bad, but it could be better. The lyrics and music just aren't The Killers at their best. <br /> <br />This River Is Wild is a favorite. It is a fast-paced song and different than a lot of typical Killers's music. It has some surprising lyrics in it--I'll leave it at that. Very good chorus as well. <br /> <br />Why Do I Keep Counting? is anotherfavorite. It has strong vocals and instruments. The chorus is infectious \\"Help me get down, I can make it, I'll make it down\\". The band, like on so many songs, seems to be having a good time and letting you know it. <br /> <br />Since I already mentioned Exitlude earlier, I won't review it, other than to say it is just like Enterlude, but a little longer.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a superb sophmore effort from The Killers. If you liked, Hot Fuss, you will definately like Sam's Town (though Flowers seems to have given up--though not entirely--his faux British-like accent, which doesn't really affect the album at all). You will have to listen to it all the way through several times before some of the songs will catch on. But you won't be disappointed--this is outstanding music from The Killers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />  <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I bought this on a whim and was pleasantly surprised at how good it is.  The graphics are incredible and the story is true to the FFVII game - it's a far cry from the 'FF: Spirits Within' movie all the Final Fantasy gaming fans were duped into watching.<br /><br />Contrary to another reviewer though, I think it's probably incredibly helpful to have played the game to understand the movie.  However, since there is a special feature recapping the game, those who haven't had the pleasure of playing yet (and I highly recommend it - the graphics of FFVII may be outdated but it is one of the best RPG's ever made) will still get the gist of what happened.
B000FTWB7G|1.0|I think this album is the biggest disappointment I've yet heard. To begin with, it's overproduced; this means several things. For starters, it's COMPRESSED. Whoever mixed this album took all the life out of Amy Lee's voice. It's not clear, crisp, or open at all. It doesn't soar like it used to; it sounds like she's singing from behind a veil. The guitars are the same; they're just this slicked down, standard distorted garbage. Their tone is completely boring. They just drone on. The sad thing is, I'm pretty sure they're playing on Mesa units, which can sound so much more soulful than this. Then, for the overal consideration, there's little to no instrument separation, it's recorded fairly hot like all new recordings, and you can tell all the peaks have just been squashed to compensate (basically, high frequencies sound like they were chopped off so as not to bother people's ears). It's even a little sibilant here and there. <br /> <br />Onto the more important stuff, that most of you will get and be interested in: the album is just so unbearably boring. By the end of it, I just found myself a little bit glad it was over. That's the first album by a band I already liked that was like that for me, ever. (I've had this experience once or twice before; the last I remember was Pearl Jam's new album, but I'm not a fan of theirs to begin with, so it was okay). There isn't a single song that jumps out at me as one I'd like to listen to over and over, or heck, even again once or twice. Lachrymosa is all right, but it's not great, and I doubt I'll even listen to it much; if I do, it'll probably be more to justify this purchase rather than because I'm dying to hear it again. The lyrics aren't anything special either. For a basic summary, here's what it sounds like, to me: it sounds like the band forgot their own identity. It sounds like at some point betweeen 2003 and now, they forgot who they were, and had someone ELSE remind them. It sounds like they made an album based on what other people thought Evanescence was supposed to be, instead of whatever they actually wanted to be. Maybe that's the problem: maybe they didn't want anything to begin with. Maybe they didn't even want to make this album. It has no identity. It has no general characteristic. It doesn't smell of ANYTHING. It's an amorphous mass of boring, uninspiring dark rock. It sounds like Evanesence ripped off themselves and failed. My best guess is it's just that Amy Lee can't do it without Ben. I mean, hell, the two of them WERE the band. When I listenened to Origin and even some parts of Fallen, and saw the popularity that Fallen garnered, I thought to myself that Evanescence was capable of changing the face of popular rock. If The Open Door is where rock is going, let me off this train; I want no part of it. I think I'll go listen to \\"Anywhere\\" and pretend this isn't the same band; because really, it isn't.
B000ESSTL0|3.0|I love Depeche Mode, and i hate to write this negative review about this PRODUCT... not the ALBUM. First of... <br />1. WHY THE HELL DID THEY PUT THE B-SIDES AND RARE IN THE DVD DISK AND NOT THE CD!!! <br />Who the hell is going to listen the these tracks through their DVD player at home! I dont have a surround sound 5.1 system!!! And i know i am not the only one!! <br />2. REMASTERED??? I DONT THINK SO!! One thing i do have is an AWSOME sound system in my car. So when i first popped this in, i basically heard the same AWSOME music i have always been listening to. This now makes me wish i dropped my two thousand on a Home Theater. <br />3. IF YOU DONT HAVE A 5.1 SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM EITHER AT HOME OR IN YOUR CAR AND ARE NOT PLANNING TO, DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!(for your car you obviously need a DVD/CD player thats 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound capatable, standard four speakers, center speaker and subwoofer, plus the cost of amplifiers!!!) Unless you are willing to drop 28 bucks just to watch the half an hour video, which is pretty cool. <br />BUT.... The one thing i DO like about this product and the only reason i gave this 3 stars is for the DVD album in Digital Surround Sound (not just surround sound or the PCSM or whatever you call it). I played this in my girlfriends home theater system and it was just BRILLIIANT. The songs sound different than in the standard CD. I mean its the same song but, since its i dunno DIGITAL SOUND??..the songs just sound different. And i mean good different. Each song stands out different, especially Sweetest Perfection and Enjoy the Silence.  <br />Bottom LINE...THIS PRODUCT WOULD JUST MAKE YOU WANT GET A DVD DIGITAL SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM IN YOU CAR OR AT HOME. I'm already saving for my car system.
067960085X|5.0|Truman Capote's career began and ended before I even learned to read. Somewhat of a new discovery for me even though I grew up with my own dvd of Breakfast At Tiffany's. His writting style is beautiful, lyrical and engagding. Breakfast At Tiffany's reads as good as the movie (or vice versa) thankfully! The additional stories are amazing in how different the characters and storyline is - and only underscores his talent as a fiction writer. Brilliant.
B000HT386M|3.0|Adam Sandler plays workaholic dad Michael in a troubled relationship with a wife, two kids and a pooch with a stuffed-duck fetish. Michael goes to a store to purchase a remote control and meets a strange man in the back of the store who gives him a remote which controls more than just his tv. It controls his life.<br /><br />I felt Click had a cute premise, but the humor seemed a bit flat. Some scenes were a bit sophomoric for me (enough with the dog and the duck), others were mildly amusing (when Michael doesn't recognize his own kid at swim practice). Some scenes were just over-the-top (such as when Michael freezes his boss and abuses him while he's frozen). Come on. All bosses are jerks. This guy didn't deserve that kind of treatment.<br /><br />The last 1/3 just seemed a bit too silly. If you come up with a fantastic premise like this one, you don't need to shaft the audience with an 'it was all just a dream' ending.<br /><br />3 stars.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|As a big fan of the TV show - and this big screen adaptation - I am puzzled by the many claims the movie \\"bears no resemblance\\" to the series that inspired it. Obviously those who think this only watched a few episodes from the first two seasons. Mann basically distilled the core elements that make the TV series a continuing cult favorite - the brooding atmosphere, the sporadic violence, the corrupt officials, the tense sense of paranoia, the doomed romances - into a single, stand alone, epic neo-noir. By de-emphasizing the 80s fashions and pastel palatte (which fools a lot of people into mis-remembering the series as \\"camp\\" when it fact it was a cutting-edge, gritty cop noir) Mann has basically updated the concept while staying true to its roots. Crockett is still a lonely hothead, Tubbs is still the cooler, level-headed partner, Castillo is still a low-talking no-nonsense leader. True fans know even the fashions and tone of the series evolved with each successive season. Mann's initial take on the TV \\"Vice\\" - that its a hardboiled, stylish reflection of its era, not a nostalgia trip - is wisely retained in the new film. The show was never about Looking Back, it was about the Here and Now (which is now There and Then). So the movie is likewise set in the present, which is not the 80s. Otherwise, the movie is completely true to the heart and spirit of the series that spawned it, and Mann is in top form. This is not a remake, it's a continuation of the original concept.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|In 2004, Guns N' Roses' record label, impatient with the endless delays of \\"Chinese Democracy,\\" decided to release this \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection without any input from Axl, or any previous members for that matter. The results aren't really as bad as one would expect, especially considering what they manage to cram into a single disc, but as with all \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums, fans are going to feel instantly letdown that their favorite songs aren't included. But, as my argument always goes, if you're a big enough fan, you already have those albums!<br /><br />Sounds Like: Nostlagic heaven.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- Includes material from all official GNR releases, even the poorly received \\"Spaghetti Incident.\\"<br /><br />- The songs are remastered and sound much better than their originals (especially noteworthy on the \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" material).<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- Songs like \\"Night Train\\" and \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" should have been included for obvious reasons.<br /><br />- Their cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" still sounds terrible.<br /><br />- Still waiting for \\"Chinese Democracy\\" (\\"with a little patience...\\").<br /><br />Personally: I own this album for two reasons. One being that the Rolling Stones cover, \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" was too much of a pain to track down on it's own, and secondly, it's makes a great mix for when you can't decide, or just want a solid set of tunes to listen to on the road. Considering they only released three full-length studio albums, it's impressive that they had enough material to warrant a \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection. I have to say though, that it would have been cool had they included \\"Oh My God\\" or anything from the \\"New\\" Guns N' Roses, just to give them a little more presence in the absence of \\"Chinese Democracy.\\"<br /><br />Best Listened To When: You're in the jungle, baby.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I was really worried about Evanescence when they lost a few band members. The CD was taking forever, and I was afraid they weren't goin to come out with one. I'm so freakin glad they did because it was well worth the wait and I can't wait to see them in Salt Lake City on Oct. 25!!!

B000E97Y6K|2.0|I was very desappointed with this movie. It was way to long and boring, I think the worst part was you already knew how it was going to end, so I felt I wasted the three hours watching it. I have to admit though the scenery was great, and I did like it when they fought the big bugs.<br /><br />I was mostly desappointed because I figured Peter Jackson would do a great job with this movie, but maybe he should stick with directing fantasy.
B000H7JD4K|3.0|I had to type this review in response to all the hype here on Amazon (what - did Maiden's fan club all agree to write reviews?) and as a long time dedicated fan I wanted to throw my hat in the ring.<br /><br />Brave New World and Dance of Death blow the doors off this release as far as the past decade goes for them.<br /><br />In the UK press and even the band themselves they hype this as \\"Maiden gone prog!\\" , \\"strongest album since the 80's\\", \\"the most musical album IM has ever done!\\" and so on. This cd is very stale and monotonous. i've listened to it 30 times and the drumming even sounds off at times and the fact \\"reincarnation\\" as a song never builds to anything (remember Rhyme of the Ancient mariner?) and it serves as an example of the pace of the cd to come.<br /><br />Of course it isn't all bad - some great guitar work here and there, Bruce sounds great and it is still better than most bands nowadays that claim to worship Maiden yet sound like faster pussycat meets screamo.<br /><br />Bottom line: unless you are a die hard I'd pick up the 80's and '00's of maiden's work before this one. Also - the solo cd's bruce did (Accident and Chemical) to me even rank up there with Maidens best work ever. Check those two out if you have not heard them right away!

B00005JPAD|5.0|I really enjoyed this film with directing that reminded me of Scorcece's Goodfellas.  DiCaprio is excellent in probably the best performance I have seen from him as a cop who agrees to become a mole into the mob.  To do so he must actually be convicted of a crime and serve time in jail.  Similarly like Larry Fisburne in Deep Cover, DiCaprio becomes a type of dark character that may not be able to actually differentiate from being a criminal and a cop. <br /> <br />Meanwhile the mob has set up Matt Damon as DiCaprio's opposite.  Damon is a state detective in a unit very close to all the investigations into the mob so he can let the mob know when something big is coming down.  Ironically, Damon and DiCaprio are dating the same woman, a physiatrist who specialty is troubled cops. <br /> <br />Things get dicey for DiCaprio as he must get enough evidence on the mob head (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) before he is found out to be the mole and killed.   Meanwhile the only two detectives that know DiCaprio's real identity are removed (I won't say how) leaving Damon in charge of the department and putting DiCaprio in grave danger. <br /> <br />Great performances up and down especially by Martin Sheen, Mark Wohlberg and Alec Baldwin.  Nicholson's henchmen are also highly entertaining (shades of Joe Pesce in Goodfellas).  I heard that this movie is a remake of a Chinese film and would like to see the original to see if it is as good. <br />
0684824906|5.0|Although at first I did not understand why writing about Lincoln's cabinet members was going to be revealing about Lincoln himself, I found myself pleasantly surprised.   <br /> <br />Goodwin goes to great lengths to help the reader understand why Lincoln chose the men he did, and how Lincoln came to be President.  Regarding humility, Lincoln had the self-assurance to place his rivals into key positions, rather than lording over them.  It is a true leader who can do such a thing.  This was unheard of in politics, even back then.   <br /> <br />The research appears to be very well done, and avoids simplifying the characters and their complexities, including Lincoln himself. <br /> <br />The revelations about the \\"great\\" General McClellan I found particularly fascinating -- I won't give it away -- you will need to read it for yourself!
B00000K19E|4.0|Warner Brothers Pictures and Video Roadshow Pictures presents \\"THE MATRIX\\".<br />  What is The Matrix?<br />  CGI effects were still brand new to filmmaking.  How could the computer-effects used in Twister (1996) and The Haunting (1999) ever be topped? A visual effect of two people fighting one man in a karate position suddenly (froze) stood still, the camera pans 360 degrees around the man as he is bend over backwards with moving bullets.  This scene was the \\"catch\\" of the film.<br />  Since The Matrix release March 31, 1999, countless films have tried to copy these visual effects, Charlie's Angels (2000), Scary Movie (2000) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000).  The Matirx was the original first.<br />  As Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) sits patiently in an apartment, the police bust in. She fights them off with karate moves that not even Bruce Lee could do. The chase is on as she runs from the police a la VERTIGO (1958) and THE CROW (1994) like Brandon Lee.  She's not Batgirl, but obviously she has the superhuman strength.  Now she has Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) on her tail.  She must run to the payphone to answer it.<br />  A new subject is needed. Neo (Keanu Reeves) wakes up. His computer displays for him to wake up and has written, \\"The Matrix has you...\\" \\"Follow the white rabbit\\"  \\"Knock, Knock\\".  There are two knocks on the door.<br />  Later, Neo meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who needs him to enter The Matrix.  Like KUNG FU (1972, 1972-75), Neo is trained by Morpheus inside the Matrix to be on the look out for Agent Smith.  He is a killer.  Neo's mission is to save the world, but first he must meet the one that can predict...the all-knowing \\"Oracle\\" (Gloria Foster) who will guide him.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, Julian Arahanga.<br />Running Time: 2 hrs. 16 min.<br /><br />Easter Egg #1: Click, \\"Special Features\\", click \\"Cast & Crew\\", Click on \\"Written & Directed by the Waachowski Brothers\\".

0618001905|5.0|This is one book every historian should read. It is a good start, especially for those studying or just interested in the History of Africa. It helps one understand the present state of affairs not only in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is what the book is all about, but on the entire continent. Once you read this book, you can then go on and read any other History book on Africa.

B00005JPAD|5.0|I just saw Martin Scorsese's new film, The Departed, last night and I have to say - it was excellent! Scorsese is back in top form here, revisiting the mobster genre that he has been known for over the years. I would rank this one up with his classic film - and one of my personal favorites - Goodfellas. It's nice to see Marty swing back to his gritty, ultra-violent self!  <br /> <br />First of all, the acting, directing, and just about everything else was state of the art. Jack Nicholson was perfect as Frank Costello, a mob boss who is in charge of the organized crime ring in Boston. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, an undercover cop who sneaks his way into Costello's gang so he can be an informant for the police department. Meanwhile, Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, an informant for Costello's mob who works for the police department, and is on his way to be promoted in the Special Investigations Unit. Both men cross paths, and fall in love with the same woman - a psychologist played by Vera Farmiga from the little-known indie Running Scared. Each man starts to become consumed by their work, and when they are both in danger of being found out, only then do tensions rise, and things get a little out of hand. The performances from the leads are all Oscar-worthy. I never thought that I'd ever say that about Matt Damon. Well, let me back that up. He was quite good in Good Will Hunting and he was great in The Talented Mr. Ripley, and his performance here is no exception. Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance here since What's Eating Gilbert Grape. DiCaprio is becoming a fixture in Scorsese's recent films, almost as if he is the director's newfound muse amongst male actors, the last one being Robert DeNiro. This is Jack Nicholson's first film with Scorsese, which is hard to believe, but it is true. Jack is back to what he does best in this role, and, pardon the cliche, but it fits him like a glove. His performance is one of ferocious intensity, and everytime he's on the screen, you feel really uneasy...and that's not a bad thing! The direction is flawless. I've already said enough about Scorsese, but the man knows how to make a great film! I must also give credit to the editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, who worked on Goodfellas. Her editing makes the film seem fast paced and hyperactive, and for a film that is thirty minutes short of being three hours long, that's amazing!  <br /> <br />However, if you are easily offended by profanity or graphic violence, then stay far away! They are both here, and in abundance.
1592401791|5.0|In the early 1960s Geoff Emerick landed the dream job music fans would have killed for; assistant recording engineer at EMI Studio working with George Martin. It was a dream job because one of the first groups Emerick worked with was the Beatles. The next seven years of musical magic and misery Emerick spent in the control room are wonderfully chronicled in this book.<br /><br />Though Emerick was a Beatles insider, he wasn't the 'Fifth Beatle' and makes no claim to that title in this book. Rather he was a young, impressionable teenager who worked with the Beatles for thousands of hours and occasionally helped them in realizing the musical vision they heard in their heads.<br /><br />What was most enjoyable about Emerick's book was his recounting of the group's musical development, the friendship and chemistry between John, Paul, George and Ringo and especially those magical moments when a song came together. Later on, when the group started to self-destruct, the magical moments were much fewer but even then, as for instance when recording 'Abbey Road,' making the music would melt away the animosity.<br /><br />Emerick was never a confidant or even a friend of any of the Beatles. He was an employee working in the control booth and the Beatles were down in the studio and the twain didn't meet that much. Some may object to his opinions about the four but, given his vantage point, those opinions are perfectly valid. Having read lots of Beatle books, I didn't come across any smoking guns in Emerick's book. Could John be short-tempered and nasty? Sure. Could he be a wonderfully funny and  compassionate man? Yup. Was Paul the most approachable Beatle? Well, duh! And on and on.<br /><br />What I find most impressive about the Beatles in the studio was this fact. Despite being virtual prisoners in the drab, soul-deadening EMI studios, they still managed - with some help from their friends - to create some of the most inventive, joyous pop music the world has ever seen!<br /><br />I enjoyed Emerick's book immensely. It's an eminently readable, affectionate, warts-and-all record of the high spots, low points, craziness and tedium and you are there! Thanks, Geoff!een! <br /> <br />I enjoyed Emerick's book immensely.

B000GQLCXC|5.0|Clear and very readable, Deutscher provides the lay reader (me) deep insight into the ever-changing structure of language.  Sometimes I needed to put it down and absorb it a section at a time, but almost every group of ideas made me feel as though I had accessed something important and left me eager to get to the next set of ideas when I was ready.  Each argument makes good intuitive sense.  No section required specialized knowledge, yet each concept was defended with solid examples.   <br /> <br />Deutscher differentiates clearly between speculation and generally held views.  His explanation of metaphor is not only interesting in iteslf but immediately improved my writing.   <br /> <br />I found his explanation of Hebrew verb structure fascinating, especially since it relates to another of my interests, the origin of that remarkble invention, the alphabet.  The alphabet seems to have been a Semitic innovation some 3 or 4 thousand years ago.  His discussion of Hebrew also provides indirect insight into why Hebrew vowels generally are not written even though they are very present and fundamental to understanding the language.  Armed with a better understanding of the evolution of language, I am also more tolerant with, like, my teenagers use of \\"poor grammar\\" or \\"imprecise word meanings\\".
B000063DI8|4.0|Records 'Iron Maiden' through '7th Son' were incredible to me!  <br /> <br />Then came NPFTD, same cool art, content tho started to drop-off. Many of these <br />tracks are simply sub-par & boring.  <br /> <br />1- Tailgunner- Nice, upbeat, moving, enjoyable.  <br />2- Holy Smoke-  not exactly the excellent style of IM but still not too bad.  <br />3- No Prayer For The Dying- eh, slow but speeds up with classic Maiden electric duets <br />4- Public Enema Number One- Nothing groundbreaking here but fast & true to old content <br />5- Fates Warning -BORING! long slow intro & should have not made it to release. Poor! <br />6- The Assassin - slightly better than average.  <br />7- Running Silent, Running Deep- filler although.. the solo's are really nice <br />8- Hooks in you- Nice, could have fit well on their debut with D'anno <br />9- Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter - Not my type of material. Never liked it.  <br />10. Mother Russia- dont really like it till the end where is really changes into a fast guitar fest.  <br /> <br />Overall not that bad.. the follow-up fear of the dark was a clear step down & then after that <br />they hit rock bottom & have not come back. X-factor to Matter of Life & Death are just a near <br />complete collapse of decent writing.
B000F8O35U|4.0|If you love Little Mermaid, then buy it.  Its great.  The only thing which I can't figure out is where the bass went.  The whole movie sounded flat.  I know my 5.1 was working as when the disney dvd logo came up, I could hear the subwoofer working and even see the readout it was.  In the actual movie, I couldnt hear any bass.  led readout said SW was on, but no action indicated on the led readout.  Btw, I loaded my Lion King.  Sound was prefect.  Either something is wrong with my copy, or Disney forgot to turn on the sw channel.
B000HEWEE4|3.0|The Lake House, starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, was an enjoyable film.  It will not be any kind of classic, but it will leave most viewers with a pleasant \\"aftertaste\\".  Keanu Reeves is a builder/architect who mysteriously begins a \\"cross-time\\" correspondence with Sandra Bullock, a new doctor.  Interestingly, it's not the Lake House (a house on stilts designed and built by Reeve's father) that is at the nexus of these two lives; it is the mailbox.  The mailbox is the mechanism for allowing messages to pass from Reeves (in 2004) to Bullock (in 2006).  Once they realize that they live in two different times, they demonstrate a surprising lack of interest in how or why this is happening, a bit unrealistic for two professionals (and their friends).  And apparently anything can pass in the mailbox (they pass a book and letters); what a great opportunity to pass a newspaper, flowers, jewelry... whatever!<br /><br />BUT... this is a love story, with a couple separated not by space, but by time.  There is a touching scene when they make a date to meet.  For him, it is a date two years in the future.  For her, it is tomorrow.  Note the resemblance to An Affair to Remember, starring Cary Grant.<br /><br />I thought Keanu Reeves was well cast for this movie.  Sandra Bullock was perhaps too \\"relaxed\\" for the physician... everything was too matter-of-fact.  All's well that ends well, and this plot ends well.<br /><br />I'd like to be the first to announce that the dog, Jack, was really an alien with time-warping abilities.  She (yes, Jack was a she) hid it well, and there was probably a huge alien complex hidden in the water under the Lake House causing these distortions in time.  But that's another story.  This one was a tale of love!
B000HEYVD6|5.0|Despite the mediocre reviews from others, I highly recommend this book.  There's enough reviews out there to give a plot synopsis, so I won't go into that.  What I'll go into instead is the fact that this book is a wonderful, supersonic-paced read that you'll enjoy.  Many reviews says this is simply not a believable plot - - YOU be the judge.  Bottom line: It's a politcal thriller with a faced-paced plot that is well worth your time.  It's on par with Clancy's earlier works.  In the current political climate, I don't find the plot outlandish at all!

I guess it's not really pboring to have over a million dollars, but I want to be able to enjoy my monye.  THeat's the purpose of this book , though- to show that you have to be boring and then you can get to be a millionaire with all the money you didn't spend on fun stuff!  I almost fell asleep a couple times reading this, but when I stayed awake it was really eye-opening.  I won't scoff at those people who don't have \\"big hats\\" but have a lot of cattle anymore.
B00004SST6|5.0|First things first, a coincidence of many things?, any song by George Benson is amazing, why is this guy so dam good looking anyway, yes, I want to look like him, sing like him and arrange/compose like him (remember here it's the other word: dam with the other letter after m).  But why do I have to get so personal you might ask, good looking is just the icing on the cake from this guy, but I could not help but come out tonight and say to the world about the song Give me the Night, this song is....world are you ready, the most perfectest song ever made perhaps in the entire universe if it's still applicable in this case....first question is, how can this song have the punch and crispiness in all the audible frequencies heard by humans, I have many times compared the cd version with my 12\\" single and you would have to maybe be in my shoes, 1970's and early 80's music guy, how can George be so bad in disco if he did it this good, remember this song is DISCO, and I say this because of the four on the floor beat and the beautiful strings arrangement, funny how it's only like three notes played by the strings, this song is the one to have an orgasm by, anyway, when I played this song on the 12\\" single for the first time, I knew we had something here, for all the haters giving bad reviews here about disco, here's to you, this song and just about any George Benson song the quality of the recordings are amazingly clear and Give me the Night will I think always be one of those very unique songs that have it all, yes even though it's disco, not much else to ad here, when do you get to hear the best singer in the world knowing which way you could have an orgasm, anyway...no bull haters...The best thing that happen to disco is George Benson jumping on the wagon..

B000G759LW|4.0|On her ambitious double CD 'Back to basics', Christina Aguilera does as the CD title states and goes back in time to the 40s and 50s, channelling the Sarah Vaughans, Arethas, Stevies, Ray Charles et all. Out also goes the trampy/dischevelled look, and in comes a more glammed up Marylin Monroe/Jean Harlow look to match.<br /><br />Belting as powerfully as ever, this time to downtempo smoky jazzy songs (the saucy 'Candyman' and 'Nasty naughty boy', and the muffled sound of the wonderful blues-ey 'I got trouble'), or upbeat horn filled retro funk/jazz jams set to hip hop beats (lead off smash hit single 'Aint no man', the name-checking 'Back in the day', the smooth funky 'Slow down baby') to mention a few.<br /><br />Where she really gets to soar is on the ballads. The tender, emotional ode to her mother 'Oh mother' (with lyrics about the abuse dealt by her father, and a lovely acoustic guitar outro), 'Understand' (great retro sample), the powerful, sweeping 'Hurt', the gospel feel of 'Mercy on me', 'Save me from myself', and the dramatic piano/string filled 'The right man' (lovely backing vocals).<br /><br />The CD has already earned her the second US #1 album of her career, and looks set to earn even more plaudits (Grammys included). An excellent album that shows phenomenal growth and depth, yet fun filled!
B000ICL3KG|1.0|I have nothing against Al Gore...or at least I didn't until this movie. <br />I have so many issues with this movie I don't even know where to start.  The main thing though, NEVER LISTEN TO A POLITICIAN LECTURE YOU ABOUT ECOLOGY, OR IF YOU DO, DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU HEAR. <br /> <br />Personally, I think making this movie about global warming was just an excuse for Al Gore to lash out at President Bush's politics.  That's all you hear throughout the movie, \\"Bush isn't doing this\\", \\"Today, your government isn't doing that\\"...An example : That little 3 minute digression on the 2000 elections and how he lost because of Florida...hum hum...I'm sorry, what does that have to do with Global Warming?  I thought it was hypocritical on his part, seeing as he WAS Vice-President and all and did he seriously care about global warming then when he had the power to do something about it? I'd also bet anything that if he were in office instead of G.W.Bush, global warming wouldn't exactly be his top priority either. <br /> <br />I was also perplexed at the passage where he explains to us unintelligent members of society that tobacco industries are vewy vewy bad because they're selling products that kill people...and unless the actual smoke that's being produced by smoking is causing the earth's C02 levels to rise, I don't see what that has to do with the subject either. <br />I also could have done without all the little passages about his life...I felt like I was watching his biography, which again has nothing to do with global warming.  I don't see how his son being hit by a car and almost dying has changed our climate. <br /> <br />What's interesting about those passages is that they always come after he's just thrown a theory or \\"facts\\" at you that don't always quite add up or there isn't exactly a solid foundation or correlation between them, so that way you don't have the time to really notice or question anything he says.  For example, when he talks about hurricanes, hesays that the hotter the ocean water, the bigger the hurricane...and explains that Katrina got bigger coming into the Gulf of Mexico...and CUT to Al Gore walking in an aiport. I'm sorry? what was that? ok...yes...I don't see what that has to do with global warming, care to connect the dots?  It's common sense to conclude that Katrina did indeed get bigger because the Gulf of Mexico has extremely warm water...ok, but he doesn't tie it to the subject at hand. <br /> <br />Also, he throws facts in your face and jumps to the next point so fast you don't have time to ask yourself questions about the information he just gave : \\"just eat it right up, don't question anything, and move on along\\".  And just to make sure anyone would dare question anything Al Gore says in his movie, let's add another scene of him walking in the airport just to get your mind off of everything.  It's complete, shameless soft-core brainwashing. <br />For example the stats about scientists all agreeing on global warming and it's causes...he took a smidgen of scientists, and then said that none disagreed. Hum Hum... go back 5 seconds when he talks about that 10 percent..he was manipulating information all over the place for that matter, and at times contradicted himself talking about the adapation of animals to warm waters, for example.   <br /> <br />Now what interests me though is the lack of reference to other planets in our solar system, especially Mars...Doesn't Mars have glaciers?  What happened to that? Isn't there evidence of there having been oceans or something like that? huh...what happened? Global warming? I doubt humans had something to do with it...so what does that tell us? <br /> <br />While Global Warming is an important issue and we certainly do have something to do with the rapidity of the process, if you want serious facts and the actual truth for a change, this isn't the movie for you.  It just puts a shiny, new, propagandic spin on things we already know.
0385338694|3.0|You have to really close your mind to the stupid plot to enjoy the  funnier moments in this, but \\"Undomestic Goddess\\" is nowhere near as amusing or laugh out loud funny as Kinsella's Shopaholic series. Sorry, but it isn't. Samantha Sweeting is almost identical to Becky Bloomwood except Sam actually has money and says \\"Er..\\" a lot. Bex says \\"Erm...\\" <br />Now, if you want to read a much better book about a woman whose mind snaps and she falls into an absorbing and funny but believable set-up, read \\"Rebuilding Coventry\\" by Sue Towensend. Kinsella looks like she already has. A lot of similiarities but her book pales in comparison.  <br />I'm giving Kinsella three stars for the saucepans and 'truffle beater' scene.
0783219695|5.0|THE STORY OF NASA'S SUCESSFULL FAILURE! ! !    This movie is base on Jim Lovell's book LOST MOON, the title coming from the fact that EVERY other astronuat that went to the moon the first time would walk on it the second. Lovell is the ONLY man to circe it both times he went there!     What makes this film so realistic is that Dave Scott (7th man out of 12 to walk on the moon)was technicial advisor on the film. I've known the story of the flight very well for years before the film was released, and watching the film I'd say to myself that this is about the time that XXX happened and sure enough a few minutes later it sure did!    Look quick at the very end of the movie for the REAL Jim Lovell, he's the Navy Captian with gray hair shaking T. Hanks hand!    see the IMAX version last. Several scenes have been edited out!
B0006GAOCW|5.0|This movie was fantastic. It was clean, yet entertaining and endearing. I loved being able to watch it with my little sisters after buying the DVD. The twist in the plot totally surprised me, and yet pleased me. Blucas does an amazing job in this film. A breath of fresh air compared to Chasing Liberty.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|This CD should come with a warning label: not fit for mature / discreet listening audiences. Listening to this bloody dreadful CD could be hazardous to your ears.  In case anyone hasn't noticed Rod has changed careers before our very eyes. He's retired from being a legendary artist to corporate sales rep( checkout the CD cover,it resembles an employee ID badge ). He's obviously opted to trade his artistic collateral to enhance the corporate bottom line.Elvis had Col. Parker and Rod has Col. Clive. My only hope is Woody and the lads can stage an intervention and get Rod into RnR artist recovery program. Someone has to successfully curb his dependency for recording every published song in America. Does Rod really want to join the ranks of Frank Sinatra jr. and company.Rumours abound on the east coast,that Rod's next project is recording all of Elvis Presley's soundtrack music 1963-69.There's also talk on the street that a box set, American Songbook vol.6-66,the Lost Recordings, are being scheduled for a 2007 holiday release.Finally,have you noticed on the web sites that various studio musicians are claiming they don't recall participating in this recording even though they're listed on the CD sleeve?
B000005IU2|5.0|I didn't really care for the Stooges when I first heard them.  They pounded out simple riffs and even simpler rhythms, sounding as if playing anything else would have revealed their utter technical incompetence.  Iggy Pop screamed, growled, and grumbled overtop the relentless music with little discipline or finesse.  My reaction was lukewarm because I was looking for the wrong things when I first listened.  I was in a sort of Prog-rock mode at the time, and thought that the greatest rock group in the world would be the one that could come up with the densest rock composition and play it with the most professionalism.  I wasn't thinking about feeling. <br /> <br />     If you listen to \\"Fun House\\" with the intent to experience the emotions it captures, you are in for something truly earth-shattering.  Nothing before or since in rock has evoked the sense of the nihilistic, angry, frustrated young man lost in a world of drugs, violence, corruption and depravity, helpless to do anything but scream his rage and anguish as a cry of defiance against the cruelty of the whole human condition, in a therapeutic celebration of the most basic impulses of mankind, testosterone fueled men in particular - to pound on things, to make noise, to swagger and screw and raise hell.  That's probably an excessive and grandiose way to phrase what The Stooges' music means to me, but the only thing that can qualify a reader to make a judgement on what I've written is listening to the album.  It's a raging storm of a piece, and I say a piece because these songs are truly unified, moreso than anything in a phony \\"concept album\\" like Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall.\\" It starts, it roars and roars, and screams, and moans, and mutters, and roars, and finally rises to a frantic, howling screech of self-destructive fury. <br /> <br />     Every song is brilliant. \\"Down on the Street\\" is a grimy picture of night life in the city, the lonely lowlife strutting through the dirt to get whatever he can find.\\"Loose\\" is the obsession of young lust pounding out its sweaty horniness. \\"TV Eye\\" is the paranoia and anger of a man who has been through everything and knows that he will go through it again. \\"Dirt\\" is the anguish of a broken relationship, not only with the woman he loved, but with everything he loved. \\"1970\\" is the prospect of a new year that might be even more steeped in glorious debauchery than the previous one. \\"Fun House\\" is that year-long party, descending and descending into oblivion. \\"L.A. Blues\\" is the oblivion, the explosion and collapse of everything.  There, I have spelled it all out.  If you aren't intrigued, forget about rock music; you don't get it and never will.
B000F1IQMS|3.0|Very little of Munich takes place in Munich. What you'll find are a series of tense situations throughout Europe where the Israeli protagonists plant bombs to kill associates of the terrorists responsible for the Munich killings. I watched, engrossed, during their first mission, but after that things started to get old. The violent, stressful, predictable scenes started to tire me out after the third mission to kill yet another terrorist associate. Munich is a good film, but it's too long. I would have been far more satisfied if the movie was an hour shorter.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I can honestly say that this cd has been playing in my car for the last two weeks straight -- again and again. People -- it is that good.  All the tracks are unbelievable and John's voice is pure gold.  I love \\"The Heart of Life\\" and \\"Stop this Train\\" -- the lyrics are meaningful and you know that when he wrote them -- he had been there experiencing it.  <br /> <br />He is here in Atlanta for 2 sold-out shows this weekend and sadly I didn't get tickets in time, but for those who did -- it is surely going to be an experience.   <br /> <br />Buy this album !!!
B000FTWB7G|2.0|For those who haven't bought the album yet and are reading these reviews to help you decide, here's some advice. Don't  buy this album with the mindset that you are purchasing a follow up album to Fallen. You're not. Infact if I were you I wouldn't walk into the store with the mindset that you're buying Evanescence's new cd, because although it may say Evanescence on the cover, this is not Evanescence. This is a new band with the same lead singer that still carries the same old band name.<br /><br />I remember reading articles about how Amy Lee had always wanted to make the music harder and how Ben Moody wanted to make it listenable, a bit more mainstream, something that EVERYONE not just the die hard heavy rock fans could enjoy. And TOGETHER they did that. They balanced each other out. Fallen was a rock album with FANTASTIC melodies that everyone could enjoy. The Open Door is not. What this album does is it appeals more to the people who didn't like Evanescence before because they thought they were too \\"Poppy\\" or their music was too \\"Commercial\\". Since when did making an album that is actually pleasing to the ears and doesn't cause migraines automatically make it poppy and commercial? Infact the only songs on the entire album I really remotely enjoyed were the first two, Sweet Sacrifice and Call Me When You're Sober. I like the music to Sweet Sacrifice, however the lyrics leave quite a bit to be desired. Its literally the same what 2 maybe 3 versus repeated over and over again? Call Me When You're Sober is good enough but it just doesn't hold up to the same standards as anything on Fallen. As for Lacrymosa, it's ok but unfortunately to me it doesn't sound as good as it seemed to in the Open Door advertisement. The what is it 10? 15 seconds of song that plays in the background of the advertisement is THE BEST PART of the entire song. Kind of like when you see a really good preview for a movie so you think the movie is going to be good so you shell out the 10 bucks to go see it ONLY to find out that the best parts of the movie were in the previews and the movie as a whole really isn't as good as the preview portrayed. That's Lacrymosa in a nutshell for me.<br /><br />With that said and with the fact that I have just admitted to moderately liking only 3 songs on the entire album, I still have to say that even those three songs don't even REMOTELY stand up to ANY of the songs on Fallen. Not one. Infact this album is terrible in comparison. Fallen had the best of everything, the great hooks and melodies that stuck in your head, the beautiful thought prevoking (non repetitive) lyrics, the gorgeous blend of guitar riffs and piano all perfectly woven together with Amy Lee's voice carrying it home.<br /><br />These songs, this entire album with the exception of the 3 above mentioned are nothing like that. These songs are for the most part either hard, angry and extremely painful to the ears to listen too OR in the case of the ballady numbers lacking of any true melody and just plain bland. Not to mention repetitive. It is just amazing to me that a new guitarist and writing partner can make such an ENORMOUS difference. Infact the very fact that this album carries the name Evanescence on it is extremely misleading because although ONE of the TWO prominent members, yes I did say TWO prominent is still in the band from the original group (as well as what? two of the original musicians) the sound is so different it shouldn't even be called Evanescence anymore, because although you can still tell its Amy Lee singing, the music sounds completely different. Infact even Amy's voice sounds different. She sounds hard and on some songs (songs that are so awful that I can't even remember the names because I couldn't listen to them in their entirety) just plain terrible. Yes people Amy actually manages to sound terrible on this album. Where as on Fallen, she sounds like an angel.  In Fallen everything fit together perfectly. The music complimentedher voice and vice versa. These songs in all honesty do nothing for her and they certainly don't do anything for me. I mean her voice gets so low at some points that she kind of sounds like a croaking man. Amy come on!! How could you do this to us? We know what you're capable of and its far better than this or should I say you used to be capable of far better than this.<br /><br />I hate to keep harping on this subject here but in all honesty, this new writing partnership just doesn't sound as good as the old. I mean listen to the difference in these two albums. It's like light and darkness. Sure Ben wasn't the best quitar player out there, but the guy could create some beautiful music. Some music that with the partnership of Amy Lee was truly a joy to listen to.<br /><br />Now I know I'm gonna tick some people off when I say this but to be quite honest, if The Open Door had been the first cd to come out and the band as it is TODAY, had been what arrived on the scene instead of Fallen and the Evanescence of old,  I truly believe they'd still be floating around in the underground. There's just no way they'd have had any of the success that they carry with them now. Success that was earned before this group became who and what it is right now. Sure the band WAS successful but that was Ben and Amy.  They earned that success together. Only time will tell if this \\"new\\" Evanescence can be as equally successful. One thing is for sure, there are going to be some very interesting times ahead.. These songs in all honesty do nothing for her and they certainly don't do anything for me.

0340188790|3.0|John LeCarre is an old master who, like Phillip Roth, keeps getting better.  I am actually a fan of LeCarre's later works and find these cold war stories of Smiley et. al. too dry, and now, too dated.  LeCarre has been able to adapt to the changing world order and his newer books reflect this.  I suppose if I'd read this book back when it was first published I'd be saying how timely it is.  But I've come to these earlier books late, and now I feel I've missed the party.  Smiley is a methodical fellow, and in this one, by the time we get to the denoument, it has all suspense of an afternoon tea.  Want LeCarre at his best?  Read The Tailor of Panama.
0316666343|5.0|I was giving \\"The Lovely Bones\\" from a friend but did not get the chance to read it because I used this book as a gift to someone else facing a loss - and I'll tell you why! Chanel Petro-Nixon (16 years old) vanished last Father's Day after telling her parents she was going to apply for a restaurant job. It seems she never made it to the restaurant.  And few days later, Chanel's strangled body was found in a trash bag in front of 212 Kingston Ave.<br /><br />Before this happened, I downloaded the audio vision from this book off of iTunes and listened to it over and over again.  I was overcome with a mixture of saddness & comfort that it made me think of all the murder girls I've heard about growing up - from the news and America Most Wanted. I also just finished reading Ann Rule's \\"Green River Running Red\\" and I'm telling you Alice Sebold's book has giving all these lost female victims a voice. . .even Chanel!<br /><br />I did not know her but I paid my respects at her funeral and provide a card and \\"The Lovely Bones\\" to the Nixon family.  I hope it has provided some comfort to them.<br /><br />All those girls our Susie Salmon and this book it outstanding no matter what anyone says!!!!
B00005176F|4.0|all i can say is that the best song here is \\"song 2\\". i remember when i bought the fifa road to world cup 98 video game. whenever i hear this song it reminds me of the game.
B000031XCR|4.0|Celine is one of my favorite singers.  She has got a powerful voice few others can match.  Plus, I like that she is not sleazy in appearance and raunchy on record.  That has probably lost her some success here in this century, when sleaze and raunch is mainstream, but she is really better than that.  She is more of an old-fashioned diva anyway, and that's how I like her:  talent, not image.    The first half of this album (the hits) is 5 stars for me, the second half (the new songs, well not new now because its 2006 and this came out in 1999, but new then!) is more like 3.  So overall I say 4 stars.  There are few songs that get to me like \\"The Power of Love,\\" \\"If You Asked Me To,\\" and \\"To Love You More.\\"  Of course the soundtrack songs are great:  \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"Because You Loved Me.\\"  She does a nice duet with R. Kelly on \\"I'm Your Angel\\" (back when he was still making relevant tunes), and though I think \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" is way over-the-top, Dion gives one of her finest performances in my opinion on this song, it's really a Broadway-worthy song/performance.  I am not crazy about \\"Love Can Move Mountains.\\"  \\"That's The Way It Is\\" is the only new song I love...it was also Celine's last big hit.    I hope she is coming out with new material soon.  I would like to see a definitive collection from her too, a disc or two that would include the 9 hits and \\"That's the Way It Is\\" on here, plus some songs that didn't make this CD like \\"Where Does My Heart Beat?,\\" \\"Misled,\\" \\"All By Myself,\\" \\"Tell Him\\" with Babs, \\"The Prayer\\" with Andrea Bocelli, and the \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" theme song she did (the name escapes me now).  Also some songs from this century like \\"A New Day Has Come,\\" \\"I'm Alive,\\" \\"At Last,\\" \\"I Drove All Night,\\" \\"Have You Ever Been In Love,\\" and \\"You and I.\\"  I hope she makes a big \\"Mariah-style\\" comeback soon without losing her class, which may not possible these days.  I'd rather her keep putting out classy, gorgeous songs and not be as commerically successful as she once was rather than try to make some embarassing hip-pop-like stab at record sales and radio hits.  I think the hip-pop suited Mariah fairly well, but can you picture Celine singing \\"Shake It Off\\" and having songs produced by JD and Kanye?  Please NO!  I'd like to see her hook-up with Max Martin again (they did some great songs on \\"One Heart\\" in '03 like \\"Faith\\"), William Orbit (maybe he could take her to the dancefloors in a classy way like he did Madonna on \\"Ray of Light\\"), and David Foster to do some power ballads again.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Inside Man is nothing without this amazing cast and without Denzel Washington leading them off it would have been ugly. Without the cast the movie is a bit predictable so it's no wonder why Denzel and Clive were in this one.  Inside Man is about a bank robbery, then the rich man that owns the bank needs to get in there to get something that he wants to keep secret, this is a story that so far has low interest in it cause if someone like Peter Richards or Mike Justice were the leading actors no one would care about this movie. It gets better though when the plot thickens cause you don't exactly know what Clive and his buddies are there for, they don't want money. The tactics the robbers are using have never been seen before, like dressing all the hostages up in the same exact clothes as the robbers so the cops don't know who's who.<br /><br />So now you've got a raging Denzel who has to find a way to save more hostages especially when he sees one killed on camera and calm, cool, and relaxed Clive because he has everyone in the palm of his hands. The end of this movie isn't shocking but it's pretty darn good and it actually helps everyone get what they want. There's not much to say about Inside Man except amazing directing by Spike, amazing acting from everybody and a job well done on taking a mediocre script and turning it into something more.
B000002O5L|4.0|As the music scene progressed in the 1980s, things began to change in the pop music landscape.    The synth-pop sound that had dominated the 1980s was now being replaced by a more \\"natural\\" guitar-laden sound.    This trend was promoted by such artists like John Mellencamp and John Fogerty who would enjoy commercial success as well as critical acclaim.    Five musicians in the 1980s would also find themselves at the center of this movement on the music landscape.   Jeff Lynne of ELO was working with George Harrison on his \\"Cloud Nine\\" album.   At the same time Lynne was working with Roy Orbison.. The story goes that Lynne, Harrison, and Orbison all agreed to sing on Orbison's song. They needed a place to record, so they contacted Bob Dylan to use his studio. Meanwhile word is that George's guitar was with Tom Petty (who was also working with Lynne). The rest is history and a supergroup called \\"The Traveling Wilburys\\" was born.    The Wilburys would enjoy enormous success.    While some people felt that Lynne was the weak member of the Wilburys, he was the man who also brought them all together.   As mentioned, Lynne was also working with Tom Petty at the time on a \\"solo project\\".    That project would turn out to be his highly successful 1989 album, \\"Full Moon Fever\\".   \\"Full Moon Fever\\" not only encapsulates the guitar-laden sound that had now taken over the landscape, but it also brings 3 of the 4 other Wilburys (the exception being Bob Dylan) into the fold. <br /> <br />The Traveling Wilburys would release two albums - \\"Volume 1\\" and \\"Volume 3\\".   There was no \\"Volume 2\\".   However over the years, \\"Full Moon Fever\\" has unofficially become \\"Volume 2\\".  In fact there is a Russian Import version that actually labels \\"Full Moon Fever\\" as \\"Volume 2\\".  As mentioned this was technically a \\"solo album\\" by Tom Petty.  For years, Petty had recorded with his band - \\"Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers\\".   While this was a \\"solo album\\", there are many of the Heartbreakers that are present on this album.   Howie Epstein lends background vocals to two songs - \\"Love is a Long Road\\" and \\"I Won't Back Down\\".  Benmont Tench lends his piano for \\"The Apartment Song\\".    Finally, Mike Campbell - possibly one of the most sought after musicians in the business contributes throughout the whole \\"Full Moon Fever\\" collection - including guitars, mandolin, bass, and keyboards. <br /> <br />When Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers burst on the music scene - they appealed to a wide variety of musical styles including Classic Rock, New Wave, and even Punk.   However, I feel that Petty's roots were still in Southern Rock.   \\"Full Moon Fever\\" definitely isn't rooted in Southern Rock, but it does have a strong incorporation of the guitar-laden sound mentioned.  This isn't an album where you are going to hear horns or a string section.   While you hear some keyboards, it will be the guitars that are going to be the story of this album - whether it's electric or acoustic, every song will make an integral use of the guitar.    On top of that, given Petty's unique voice - this really becomes something special. I give a lot of credit to Lynne for putting this all together.  It's kind of ironic that Lynne was able to pull off producing both \\"Full Moon Fever\\" and the Traveling Wilburys.  Lynne was known for his intricate orchestral arrangements with ELO, yet Lynne finds a way to make the natural guitar-laden sound work for Petty on this collection. <br /> <br />\\"Full Moon Fever\\" is known for the \\"hits\\" that were spurned off this album - these songs being: \\"Free Fallin\\", \\"I Won't Back Down\\", and \\"Runnin' Down a Dream (to a lesser extent \\"Yer So Bad\\" and \\"A Face in the Crowd\\" were also hits).    These are good songs, but surprisingly, I found the \\"other songs\\" to be the strong points of this collection.   Songs such as \\"Love is a Long Road\\", \\"Feel a Whole Lot Better\\", \\"Depending on You\\", \\"The Apartment Song\\", \\"Alright for Now\\", \\"A Mind With a Heart of It's Own\\", and \\"ZombieZoo\\" were the albums strongest songs.   Any of these songs could have easily been released as singles and could have achieved a high level of commercial success. <br /> <br />As mentioned, three of the Wilburys make contributions to this album  Roy Orbison lends his background vocals to \\"Zombie Zoo\\".   George Harrison lends Acoustic Guitar and Background Vocals to \\"I Won't Back Down\\".  Lynne, while lending his hand at co-producing this album with Petty and Mike Campbell also lends Vocals, Bass, Guitar, and Keyboards to the effort.   Who can forget the terrific vocal jam between Petty, Harrison, and Lynne on \\"I Won't Back Down\\" - i.e. the classic \\"Hey Baby!\\".    While Harrison didn't directly contribute to the track \\"Feel a Whole Lot Better\\", I'd like to think he had some influence on the cover of the Byrds' \\"Feel a Whole Lot Better\\".   This cover gives the song a distinct Beatle-sque quality.   I give Petty a lot of credit for being able to pull this off.   At the same time, Petty also remains true to his Southern Rock roots.  \\"A Mind With a Heart of It's Own\\" definitely sounds like something Petty would have done with the Heartbreakers.  Finally, if you want to hear Tom Petty do a lullaby, listen to \\"Alright for Now\\". <br /> <br />Perhaps the most interesting part is when Petty puts an interruption prior to the start of \\"Feel a Whole Lot Better\\".  This interruption tells CD listeners to \\"wait\\" until LP or Cassette listeners are able to flip over their media on their player - most humorous. <br /> <br />The liner notes do include all of the lyrics and all of the musician credits and acknowledgements.  Overall, fans of Tom Petty and the Wilburys will not be disappointed with this effort.   Although this collection does have a guitar-laden sound, it will have a lot of appeal to the mainstream.   This is one collection I highly recommend.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|My wife and I had never seen EVERWOOD when it was on TV back in 2002. Someone had written that it goes right to the heart. We found it going right to the heart of family and right to the heart of community. This is small town USA at its best. The casting of each character is excellent. <br />The scenery is beautiful. The exchanges between Dr.Andy Brown and his son, Ethram are so true to life today. There is alot to be learned from watching this series. Season 2 please!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is vivid proof that there's still some intelligence left in Hollywood: a daring straight-forward, in-your-face story, Fight Club is an outstanding film that takes no concessions whatsoever towards the viewer, becoming a cult film years after its release like often these type of films do, Fight Club is flawless, from the performances to the cinematography to the well blended special effects. Not since Stanley Kubrick a director has been so bold in talking about these subjects of alienation and the nature of violence in the consumer society we live in. It's worth more than one look.

0156027321|5.0|This was a complete surprise.  The story doesn't leave you for a long time.  Yann Martel weaves a tale that is multi-dimensional and colorful; so full of life.  It's a tale that makes you laugh and cry.  It's so visual that I eagerly await the screenplay to be written.  It's the best of all famous tales woven into a wonderful yarn that weaves a quilt that has many layers to it.  You won't want the story to end, but at times, out of desperation, you wish it would.<br /><br />This story takes two paths...you get to choose which one you wish to believe.  I always ask people who've read this book, which one they picked.  It's a story that still stays with me, years after I've read it.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|Nanny McPhee has everything, fabulous story, fascinating and entertaining characters, excellent dialogue (and we all know how rare that is!), superb music, warm fuzzy ending.  I have watched it as many times as the kids.  Can't seem to pass through the room without stopping to enjoy it again.  And no, I repeat NO ugliness that the children cannot see and hear.  Outstanding.
B000FUF6QS|1.0|The movie? Long and pointlessly boring, moving with the rapid fire pace of a sloth on tranquilizers, case in point? the opening sequence of this film and, the horrific folk music accompanying it, if they had dragged it out any longer they would have had to included credits thanking the postmans second cousin twice removed, and that music, ughh (shudder) it's the only real element of horror to be found in this second rate piece of tripe. Let's move on to the plot, wait a sec let's call it the \\"story\\" as I'd hate to deem anything as transparent as the goings on in this film as being deemed worthy of the title plot. A young girl has gone missing on an island made up entirely of hedonistic pagans that frolic about naked and have sex by moonlight, nothing suspicious to tip you off that morales might not play into the collective conscience or decision making process employed by this group of people huh? A single UNARMED police officer comes to inquire as to the missing girls whereabouts, arriving by sea plane, and never informing his superiors by checking in, at all, ever, during the course of this film, just leaves his plane in the harbor and never secures it to mooring in case of foul weather, nor does he go back to check on it,so much for police procedure, but wait that's not the first hole you could drive a truck through in this ahem, story. I'm guessing the poulation of this island to be well over a hundred people based on the number of extras in certain scenes, did I mention he didn't bring a gun?  Lets jump ahead oh, say 25 min into this cinematic catastrophe as there is little if anything going on except people singing, and singing and singing......more than in your average Disney movie, f*ing dirty hippies. Everyone in the village, including the girls mother, denies knowing the missing girl by name or recognising her picture that was sent to the police via a letter.... from the girls mother.... Wouldn't she have been arrested for issuing a false complaint? Oh wait! he fails to ask if she was indeed the party that issued the letter, in point of fact he NEVER bothers to inquire as to who it was that sent the letter in the first place..Ah heck, let's not let a little thing like logic stand in our way shall we?  Next for your viewing displeasure is the lack of any real detective work done by the totally inept police officer, only once during the course of his investigation does he threaten someone he's questioning with arrest for withholding evidence after he does indeed discover that yes, a little girl named Rowan did exist AND, she is now deceased, buried in the graveyard across from the school she attended, with NO DEATH CERTIFICATE ISSUED, he never even gets around to asking who the physician was that pronounced her dead. I think even Barney Fife would have called Andy in for back up on this one, at least he would have had a gun, albeit with only one bullet which by all rights should have been saved for the script writer of this piece of garbage. <br />After recieving permission form Lord Summersby (Christpher Lee) to exhume the girls remains, he discovers that her coffin only contains the corpse of a dead rabbit,(please insert joke here)  <br />I must take this opportunity to comment on a great actor Mr. Christopher Lee, who's performance in this movie is as wooden as the burning effigy seen at the end of this film, I've seen tougher actin in tough actin tinactin........ <br /> The plot digresses into the formulaic from here when the officer finally decides to go for back up. hmm....I wonder if his plane will start? Oh my, it doesn't? I'm so(not)surprised. <br />I won't ruin the train wreck of an ending you can see coming with this one dear viewer only let me say this, in all my years it's the first time I wanted to snap a DVD in half for sheer revenge, it was that bad, even the naked jiggle fests that insued during certain scenes courtesy of some very curvy, well put togethor eye candy galabanting around fires and, in graveyards was not enough to make it worth setting through 88 min of the American edit of this film, how could anyone set through the unedited version of this?  <br />My real rating? I give it the finger, sideways!

0316168815|2.0|A book's ending can make or break it.  While the majority of this story was fairly decent, it fell apart at the ending.  I liked the idea that the young girl was telling her story from heaven.  Unfortunately, the author seemed to have been struck with a case of writer's block at the end and asked a stranger to write the ending.  That could be the only explanation.  Why else would the girl come down from heaven to have sex with some boy, but never come down and reveal her killer?
B0009X766Y|5.0|Reuniting the stars of \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" Robert Redford and Paul Newman, \\"The Sting\\" went onto win 7 Oscars in 1973 including Best Picture. Watching it now, it's not hard to see why. It's really a great film.  <br /> <br />Oscar winner Redford (Best Director, 'Ordinary People') plays Johnny Hooker, a conman who has just conned the wrongman. After he steals some money that's being delivered to another conman named Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), his friend is killed. Johnny enlists the help of expert conman Henry Gondorff (Newman), who helps Johnny plan the ultimate sting on Doyle.  <br /> <br />The movie keeps piling on the twists up until the slightly predictable ending. But, that's OK because the film has a lot of classic scenes and is first rate entertainment. If you've seen Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, you know that Redford and Newman work well together. As Henry and Johnny, they're perfect. The suspense in this film is great, especially scenes like the poker game; The movie won 7 Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, and Best Art Direction. The Oscar that it should've won was Best Cinematography; There's some pretty innovative shots in here, as when Johnny comes to his friends apartment to find him dead. While it looks like some people on Amazon. com don't like this movie (It's got a 3 1/2 star Average Customer Review); Don't listen to them. This is high quality entertainment. <br /> <br />GRADE: A

I would have liked to see a section on the new 2.6 scheduler.  <br /> <br />If you want to start off with Linux kernel programming, I would recommend Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love. These books, together with articles on the web, should certainly help anyone interested.
B000I2IT44|5.0|Received my disc last night and, after some attitude adjustment, got down to bizness. What can one add to the other rave reviews presented herein? Sound and video - excellent. Have been into this band since around 95 and definately agree with the other reviewers that PT is (and has been) the best band on the planet for the past ten years. Missed a chance to see them in Atlanta last year, but this set makes me feel a whole lot better about it. If you havn't heard this band, do yourself a favor, get into it. You will not be dissapointed.
B0000259CP|4.0|No doubt, Pet Sounds is a pivotal point in recording history, but the greatest album of all time i think not.  This clown Jerry McCulley claims Sgt. Pepper misses the point, uh? As far as the Beatles are concerned, McCulley is right that Rubber Soul was the inspiration, but how can Sgt. Pepper miss the point when it was in a league of its own and quite simply the most important album in  the history of western civilization, and to boot it was the expansion of what the Beatles started with Revolver, the greatest album of all time in my opinion. <br />Nevertheless Pet Sounds is a great album with alot of innovative sounds and daring exploration for its time.  It is an essential album to own.
B000HT386M|3.0|Click is an anomaly of sorts. It isn't quite a comedy, but it's got too many funny moments to be a drama. I guess it's a dramedy, which is important to know if you go into it expecting a lighthearted, fun, family movie. It is each of those things, but at different moments. Adam Sandler plays a workaholic architect who is so busy trying to get ahead at work that his family life begins to suffer.  When he is offered a \\"universal remote that controls your universe,\\" he jumps at the chance to have a sense of control in his chaotic life. The next thing he knows his life is a DVD complete with commentary from James Earl Jones that he can pause, rewind, and fast forward at his leisure.<br /><br />The moral of the story is that you should be careful what you wish for because when you get it, you might not want it anymore. Overall, this movie was fine, but I didn't think it was stellar.  It's along the same lines of Bruce Almighty and that movie about disappearing poop with Jack Black. If you liked those, or the general message therein, I think you'll like this one. I wasn't expecting the middle part of the movie to be such a downer, but if you go into it expecting the somber moments I think you'll enjoy it more.<br /><br />Also, David Hasselhoff plays Sandler's boss, a completely self-absorbed misogynist. Seeing Mitch Buchanon on screen again makes this movie worth watching in and of itself.
B000GDH9AA|4.0|True the audio on this leaves a little to be desired. The audio is not \\"professional\\" by any means - the original source of this is the \\"in house\\" mix from the Shoreline Amphitheater which used it's own camera's to show the concert to the crowd - this was released as the DVD of same name. <br /> <br />At first listen you will not like the audio, but rather then say it's bad (which I did) I LISTENED to the rest of it and whatever mistakes there are, these do not matter if you ENJOY the show. <br /> <br />That said - I recomend this to any Clapton fan, as well as those that like Dire Straits even though this concert only features one DS song. The interplay between Eric and Marc is fun to watch and listen to.
B00005ASHM|5.0|1. The Beatles never need to be defended.

There has never been an argument that \\"I Get Around\\" is the greatest song of all time,is there? <br /> <br />2. The Beatles were a BAND. The Beach Boys, particularly during the Pet Sounds sessions, were more of a vocal group. Just look at the production notes: All songs composed by Brian Wilson, instrumentation by studio musicians, lyrics by Tony Asher (who, for those who don't know, was NOT a member of the group.), with most lead vocal duties covered by Brian wilson and the rest by the other Boys. If anything, the argument shouldn't be for the Beach Boys as a band, but rather for Brian Wilson as a songwriter and producer of ONE great album. The Beatles wrote and performed their own albums, with no dominant songwriter/arranger. <br /> <br />3. There is no argument as to what the best Beach Boys album is. However, it is nearly impossible to reach a consensus amongst Beatles fans to determine their greatest achievement. \\"Revolver?\\"\\"Sgt. Pepper's...?\\"\\"The White Album?\\"\\"Rubber Soul?\\"\\"Abbey Road?\\" I know many who consider \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" to be their best. They didn't just make one masterpiece. Everything they did was incredible. <br /> <br />The bottom line: \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a brilliant album. I will never dispute that fact. However, this does not in the least qualify The Beach Boys as better than The Beatles, especially not as a band. Brian Wilson knew what he was doing: Making a very different, but in reality, familiar album. \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a very safe record. It was not so much about making new, revolutionary music, as it was about making \\"the great American pop album.\\" Which it is. But it seems hardly fair to compare two bands, one of which made one classic, whereas the other made nothing BUT classics.
0670034711|5.0|I heard this book discussed briefly earlier this year on the Today Show and decided to order it since, at the time, I was in the throws of my own divorce.  Ms. Gilbert chronicles her international journey of self-discovery with such amazing detail and tenderness and humor that I recommend this book to anyone who has found him or herself in a place or state that he or she would like to change or leave (I imagine, that's everyone!).  The story is engrossing and the writing is skillful.  I couldn't put it down, and I feel more empowered to follow my own dreams and heart after finishing the book.  That's 5-star material if I've ever seen it.
0385751060|3.0|I would like to write a review of this unusual book, but the publisher doesn't want me to. If I review this book, I will have to tell you what it is about, and the point of the whole experience, the publisher will say, is to come to the slow realization of where the action is taking place, and thus feel the horror as it all dawns on you with various \\"a-ha\\" moments. <br /> <br /> It is for this reason that the novel should be successful among young adult readers. The book flap states, \\"We think it is important that you start to read this book without knowing what it is about.  If you do start to read this book, you will go on a journey with a nine-year-old boy called Bruno.... And sooner or later you will arrive with Bruno at a fence. Fences like this exist all over the world. We hope you never have to encounter such a fence.\\"  <br /> <br /> Intrigued? Imagine the naïve but sincere 12 year old with a smattering of Holocaust education as he reads about how young Bruno's family moves from their comfortable home in Berlin to a rather desolate place that Bruno thinks is called \\"Out-With\\". The year is not specified. Somebody named the \\"Fury\\" has come to dinner and believes Bruno's father is destined for greatness. Father wears a \\"fantastic uniform\\" and has an \\"important job.\\"  Bruno misses his friends. Soldiers say mean things about people. The family's waiter at the new, gloomy house secretly tells Bruno he was once a doctor. Out the window, Bruno notices people wearing striped pajamas. <br /> <br /> There is a palpable sense of mystery and dread as a young reader gathers the many clues enabling him to figure out where Bruno now has to live and what his father's \\"important\\" job is. When Bruno finds a young friend through clandestine meetings at the long fence separating the two boys, the reader has already concluded that this story will not have a happy ending. Young adults will appreciate the author's trust in their capabilities to comprehend historical events withoutadult explanation. But they are also required to place themselves inside young Bruno's head---to become nine-year-olds with no historical reference to the time at hand, and thus, no understanding of why \\"Out-With\\" is such a truly awful place. <br /> <br /> The problem with this rather daring Holocaust story is that adults reading it will likely not share the experience of the child.  Adults have too much frame of reference and can dismiss out of hand the unlikelihood of the events as described. Adults will rightly comment, \\"How is it possible for a German child to be that naïve? Hasn't he heard a thing about Jews by his age? Is this supposed to be some sort of fable? Doesn't it trivialize the Holocaust, since it is just so preposterous?\\" It will be interesting to note the reactions of adult reviewers when the book is released in September, and then it will be worthwhile to compare those reactions to what kids say. I am guessing that the more one knows the truth about life at a concentration camp, the more exasperating the book will be.  But there are some young people who know just enough, and the power of this novel will be something those kids will not soon forget. Overall, this \\"fable\\" is a unique approach to the Holocaust for young readers and one sure to provoke much discussion. <br />Reviewed by Lisa Silverman.
1569242739|5.0|I have been a wandering vegan for about a year now, and the only reason I wander is to indulge in delicious, yummy sweet treats that contain egg and/or dairy.  I was so impressed with Isa's first book that I pre-ordered this one from Amazon, and I shall wander no more!  Wow.  This is a must-have for anyone who is vegan or allergic to dairy.  You can pretty much recreate any of your favorite cupcake (or cake, for that matter - same recipes, different pan) recipes without the need for cholesterol-laden egg or milk products (calories are another story...).  The layout of the book is wonderful, and the pictures are great!  I am so excited to make these as gifts for friends during the upcoming holiday season.  They'll NEVER believe they're VEGAN.  I think that's the highest compliment any pastry chef could receive.  5 GLOWING STARS!  Thanks, Isa, for making veganism so easy and tasty :)
B0002VKZL6|5.0|This is a fantastic release by Knopfler.  The tracks run smooth with one great cut after another. It contains fine guitar work and poetic lyrics.  I am always impressed with Knopfler's writing skills and this one does not disappoint.  I've had Shangri-La  in my car player for almost a year now, it's found a home.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|2.5 to 3 stars. <br /> <br />I think this album grows on you with each listening - at least it did for me.  The first time I finished the album I was pretty disappointed, because nothing really stood out as a good song that I'd love to listen to again and again, except for Lithium (Call Me When Your Sober is ok now that I listen to it more, but I never liked it much the first time I heard it).  It really takes some getting used to, as even \\"Fallen\\" took some time for me to get used to it before I loved it.  I don't think I'll end up liking this album as much as Fallen, but I like it better now than my first impression.  <br /> <br />I was never much into hard rock, and this album seems harder, even darker (in sound, not in subject matter) than the first, but after the third time listening I actually find myself enjoying the first 5 songs.  Cloud Nine I didn't like at first, and then after repeated listenings I really started to like the guitar rhythms that came in.  Lacyrmosa and The Only One are good listens as well.  The other songs on the album I don't like so much.  Basically, this album is less commercial and more moody (for lack of a better word...).  For instance, the beginning of The Only One sort of sounds like it could be the background music for some sort of dark film, or even like what you might find on a soundtrack for a tv show like La Femme Nikita.  I don't want to say it's \\"atmospheric\\" because I associate that with Fallen....but I think I'll say that, sometimes, The Open Door is \\"ambient.\\" <br /> <br />All in all, a good sophomore effort for Evanescence, though not immediately as likable as \\"Fallen\\" of course.  I don't think for this type of album it is possible to give a definitive review that will help anyone decide whether or not to buy it.  It's an album that you really have to listen to yourself and decide.  I suggest going to a record store that lets you listen to it before buying it (the previews on iTunes really don't give an accurate impression - you have to listen to entire songs because the difference between a verse and chorus on this album can be a bit extreme).  If you're in Canada, some Future Shops and HMVs will let you listen to a demo copy of the album. <br /> <br />As a last point, I just want to say I disagree with the reviewer who said that Evanescence is only doing what they think is expected of them and not what they want.  Obviously, if they were doing what's expected, this album would be more commercial and more likable on first impression.  Even if I had really disliked this album (as I did at first) I'd still have respect for Amy, that she went out on a limb and did what she wanted to do, did some more experimental things with this album.  At the least, you can say that she made this album for herself and to her own liking, not for anyone else.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Few bands have been able to overcome the seemingly inevitable \\"sophomore slump\\", as music critics call it. That is, their second album doesn't measure up to the first whatsoever. This is unfortunately the case with many great bands, partly due to the fans' and critics' continual comparison to the debut album.  \\"Room On Fire\\" could've very well been considered a brilliant stand-alone album, if it wasn't for their stunning first album, \\"Is This It\\". \\"Room On Fire\\" has somewhat failed to meet general expectations, being that it is evident that the band is really capable of more. <br /> <br /> The Strokes have chosen very wisely with their release of memorable radio songs; 'Last Nite' from \\"Is This It\\", 'Reptilia' from \\"Room On Fire\\", and then 'Juicebox' from \\"First Impressions of Earth\\". These songs recall the sort of complexity and style of music of past generations. They are still thoroughly modern in sound, with Julian Casablancas' clever, articulate vocals, backed by guitar rhythms, melodious bass, and continuous drumming. Each of their albums almost seem as if they're each one whole song broken up into different phases. It's a good album, and would be even better by itself if there wasn't the shadow of \\"Is This It\\" looming over it. Still, \\"Room On Fire\\" appears to have lost some of the freshness and pep that was present in their first album. <br /> <br />The songs that were released as radio singles, 'Reptilia', '12:51', and 'The End Has No End', were all catchy enough to lure in album sales. The rest of \\"Room On Fire\\", however, contains many songs that are rather similar to one another. The Strokes have figured out a pretty good formula for coming up with a plausible melody, but how many times can that formula be repeated before fans get bored? When you hear one of their songs, it is unmistakably The Strokes, and it is a good thing that they have come up with their own style. However, this album as well as their 3rd album \\"First Impressions of Earth\\", suffers from having too much of the same. They are still one of the better bands around in the 00s, though they have yet to show their full potential.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|I waited patiently for years and finally they put out a new album. I was a huge fan of these guys because i believed \\"Fallen\\" was a great album. When their guitarist left i thought it was a big deal because his lyrics and musical contribution itself was a big part of this band. But the guitarist of Cold, another fav band of mine, took his place. So i thought at least they found a good replacement. But when i heard the new single i was somewhat disappointed, it was okay but it still wasnt even as good as the worst song off of \\"Fallen\\". This new album is different from the last one and you can feel the emptiness in the music without the old guitarist. Even the new lyrics are somewhat repetitive. I thought about giving this album 1 star but at least it had 4 or 5 decent songs.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|In the atmosphere of so much music labled as particular genres like \\"rock\\" or \\"pop\\", here comes a very different sort of band that doesn't seem to care about such distinctions. The band was luckily able to gain recognition, due to some promotion on MTV's \\"Advance Warning\\" program and radio play on alternative stations. Though \\"The Funeral\\" was released in 2004, it could've very well been released in any other era. It carries with it a sort of timeless quality that's not modern, but not entirely antique either. This effect is achieved through the variety of musical instruments, use of lyrics of a poetic quality, and the sincere earnestness found in the vocals. <br /> <br /> I particularly appreciate albums such as this that sound good from start to finish; the kind where you don't feel the need to skip over any songs. A few of the stand-out songs include 'Neighborhood #2 (Laika)', 'Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)', and 'Rebellion (Lies)'. \\"The Funeral\\" is a rather different, well-produced effort that shows promise for The Arcade Fire's future music.
B000002KIK|5.0|OK, so I might draw flak for saying so, but in my mind, this is Sabbath's best work.  It's so melodious, so innovative, so beautiful... there are seeds here that lead to Osbourne's solo career.  Now I should say that I'm much older now than when I first started listening to Sabbath (when I was 12, back in the eighties).  This is an album that may have more appeal to older listeners like me, whose musical tastes have refined somewhat--- no offense to you pure blood metal fans--- but I listen to jazz, classical and world music, too, and I find this Sabbath album has so much more musical richness than their earlier albums.
B0006U4UAU|4.0|Though the 2000s have suffered from a lack of decent electronic/dance-style music, LCD Soundsystem has come out with a surprisingly good collection of songs of that genre. The songwriting and the music come across as incredibly confident, for this being their first album. James Murphy's vocals have a sort of coolness (and even a hint of sarcasm) that really strengthens the album. Not for one moment do they give off the impression of a mediocre, unpolished group. <br /> <br />Many of the songs are long in length (many are around 5 minutes, with one going on for nearly 12), partly because of the alternative-electronic genre they are a part of. Despite the number of songs and their length, the songs don't come across as repetitive. The longest song is even entirely instrumental, something rarely seen from modern bands. There isn't the \\"filler material\\" usually present in most bands' albums, since all of the songs are listenable and each have their own expressive quality. The first disc flows together well from start to finish and the second disc is composed mainly of longer and more dance-oriented songs. <br /> <br />One thing I noticed is how similar James Murphy's delivery of vocals are to Mark E. Smith of The Fall. They both have the same sort of inflection in their singing style, though Murphy is American and Smith is British. Then again, many artists of the present have been influenced by (and thus sometimes imitate) artists of the past. The similarity isn't so strong as to overwhelm the music, but is definitely easy to detect in certain songs.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|And I had to wait how long?!  Fallen was amazing, touching, and inspirational.  I listened to many of the songs on that album 100s of times.  I searched and found every other song Evanescence ever released and listened to those too.  I went to two of their concerts.  More than one of their songs has brought me to tears.  In many of those songs it seems as though Amy was compelled to expose her deepest feelings through song under pain of death.  She sang her heart out, you could hear it in her voice, you could hear the feeling.  No song on \\"The Open Door\\" asks to be listened to more than once.  There is no energy, there is no emotion, there is only a bland, predictable, and absolutely \\"perfect studio\\" Evanescence sound.    AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGH!
B0002IQNAG|4.0|I just saw Dawn of the Dead for the first time. I actually saw the remake first, which I liked. And, of course, I've seen the terrifying Night of the Living Dead many, many times and will probably see it again this Halloween. So going in, Dawn of the Dead was a little behind the eight ball, so to speak. But considering the large number of preconceived notions I had regarding the film, I did enjoy it and would recommend it. A con and a pro: <br /> <br />CON: I truly believe that the greatest horror films are black and white. Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, Diabolique, Psycho and, of course, Night of the Living Dead, to me, are masterpieces that just wouldn't be the same if shot in color. The shadows are darker, deeper and more sinister. Danger and menace seem to lurk around every corner. And night seems to fall over the proceedings like a shroud, waiting to swallow up everything. Perhaps it was part of director George Romero's satire of the consumer culture that prompted him to shoot the film in bright colors. However, I kept thinking of the spooky quality of the grainy black and white photography of the first film and Dawn of the Dead suffered a little bit in comparison. The color was especially jarring when blood was shown. Romero wanted a bright, unrealistic quality to the blood -- sort of like a comic book. However, the effect of this is to make the blood look like a spilled raspberry smoothie. The film is very scary, but might have been more so had Romero shot it in black and white. <br /> <br />However, Romero wisely stuck to the philosophy of the original when it came to casting. Probably because of budgetary constraints, he cast unknowns from the Pittsburgh area in the film. The remake of Dawn of the Dead released in 2003 was good, but it was a big studio film with recognizable actors like Ving Rhames. When the actors are people the audience knows, there is a separation that takes place. I thought several times during the remake, for example, that there wasno way Ving Rhames could be killed off early in the film as he was the most recognizable star (I was right). Part of what made Night of the Living Dead so terrifying was that we didn't know the actors. Anyone could be killed at any time. Nothing was sacred (Johnny gets killed off immediately, Tom and Judy burn to death and become zombie food, Karen dies and kills her mother, etc.). Romero continues this tradition in Dawn of the Dead. We have no history with these actors, so it becomes easier to think of them as their characters. Most of us have no safety net of knowing the actors from previous work, so we have no idea who is going to live and who is going to die. It adds a level to the horror that is missing in the remake. <br /> <br />Overall, Dawn of the Dead is a worthy follow-up to Night of the Living Dead. Like most sequels, it doesn't quite match up, but unlike most sequels, the drop-off isn't that much. Romero has jazzed up the formula with satire and dark humor, but he still manages to scare the hell out of the audience.
B000301YY8|5.0|Lyrically gripping and melodically soulful, every song has an edge that will take you to another place.  I wish I knew James Blunt when he was playing the local circuits in London, you will too.
B000002J1S|5.0|The best album from Genesis and quite possibly the finest rock album of all time. Peter Gabriel is super strong with his vocals and band is super tight. The story which is told through the lyrics and the extensive liner notes,  is deep and thought provoking. It blows away Tommy as \\"the best Rock Opera\\" It has a dark side which features drug, sex, violence, gangs, isolation and finally redemptions. Please take the time to read the lyrics and liner notes. Music stands very well on it own, but is enhanced by knowing the story.
0441172717|5.0|I'll start with this: Dune is a great science fiction book. It captures the reader and holds them tight. There are wonderful parts with great characters and a fascinating plotline. The politics in this book are really great and interesting. There are, however, parts that are less interesting, and sometimes let the reader down.<br /><br />The book is not spectacular. There are definitely other books out there that are better than Dune. What is special with it is that it has this good plotline with lots of action and intruiging concepts, and that it also has characters that are interesting.<br /><br />The story is about Paul, his family, the families at war around him, and the spices found only on Dune. Paul is a strange kind of kid, but he's fascinating as a character, and understanding where his head is is great. We also get to know his mother very well, and she was personally my favorite character.<br /><br />This is a science fiction classic. Despite there being better books out there, I can't help but like it more than one should. Despite minor flaws, and other small things, I know that you, the reader, will not be as eager to read it should I rate it a four. It deserves a four-and-a-half, because reading it is certainly worth your while.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I was so excited when I heard Evanescence was planning a follow-up album to \\"Fallen\\". I caught the video of \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" and eventually the digital track. Amazing first single from \\"Open Door\\". I haven't listened to the entire album, but I will be tuning in soon. Myspace Music has song clips from \\"Open Door\\"... The track \\"Lacrymosa\\" is haunting. Another track is \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\" that is mournful but hopeful at the same time. Imagine that! This new album by Evanescence sounds like it will have several tracks that deserve airplay but will never be heard. <br /> <br />You won't be disappointed with \\"Open Door\\" if you enjoyed \\"Fallen\\". A lot of listeners will think this CD will sound like their first album, but I disagree to some extent. This CD holds a lot of potential despite some of the reviews I have seen that do not believe in it.
0792164903|5.0|Although I respect Tim Burton as a great filmmaker, I'm generally not a fan of his films; they usually strike me as eminent examples of style over substance (which, in a sense, isn't his fault since he's not usually the writer). Plus the films he usually picks to direct simply aren't my cup of java (for instance, I have no plans to catch &#34;Edward Scissorhands&#34; anytime soon). But who can deny his talent for visuals and overall production? This guy knows how to make a film LOOK good, that's for sure.<br /><br />As for &#34;Sleepy Hollow,&#34; this is Burton's stylish 1999 take on Washington Irving's classic tale about Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman starring Johnny Depp as Crane and Christopher Walken as the Hessian horseman. The story is set in 1799 and involves Crane, a constable from New York City, sent to the Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of gruesome murders where the victims are decapitated. As usual, Depp is outstanding. He portrays sleuth Ichabod in a very human manner, e.g. he's afraid of spiders and amusingly passes out on occasion.<br /><br />Other than Depp, four things really impress me about this picture: (1.) I love the spooky Fall atmosphere; it obviously takes place sometime in gloomy November. (2.) I always thought the concept of the headless horseman was insipid, but &#34;Sleepy Hollow&#34; depicts him (it?) in such a horrific/supernatural fashion that he's actually scary, not to mention skilled with weaponry and virtually unstoppable. I wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley, or anywhere else for that matter! (3.) Miranda Richardson was almost 41 at the time of filming, but -- man -- is she gorgeous! Nuff said. Christina Ricci also looks great and so does Claire Skinner in a small role. (4.) &#34;Sleepy Hollow&#34; lacks the goofy vibe that some of Burton's films possess; the material is presented in a respectable, generally serious manner, albeit not as ultra-serious as, say, Hammer horror. Speaking of which, &#34;Sleepy Hollow&#34; strikes me as a modern Hammer film more than anything else. Maybe that's why Burton gave Christopher Lee a cameo. Needless to say, if you love Hammer -- and who doesn't? -- you'll appreciate &#34;Sleepy Hollow.&#34;<br /><br />The last half hour or so is packed with action so if your attention starts wandering, don't worry, it picks up big time. The plot's a whodunit and it gets kinda convoluted so you'll need to pay attention. Not that you HAVE to because &#34;Sleepy Hollow&#34; is such a cinematic feast you can enjoy it even if the complications of the plot lose you.<br /><br />There's nothing else to say except to re-emphasize that &#34;Sleepy Hollow&#34; is definitely the ideal creep flick for the autumn, or any time really.<br /><br />The film runs 105 minutes and was shot in England and New York.<br /><br />GRADE: A-ollow&#34; strikes me as a modern Hammer film more than anything else.

0792164903|5.0|\\"Sleepy Hollow\\" Has just the right amount of everything to make it quite a memorable movie. The atmosphere that Sleepy Hollow portrays makes this movie  <br />a quite essential Halloween treat! Picture and sound quality on this DVD are first rate which is a relief as the movie contains lots of dark scenes with which inferior transfers would suffer terribly.
B0002JJBZY|4.0|I purchased the boxed set in mid-August 2006 and unfortunately, due to a defective disk, returned it immediately.  I say unfortunately because the set was immaculate otherwise.  Amazon's replacement service kindly sent a replacement set the day I was sending the original back--gotta love that; thanks Amazon!  HOWEVER, the replacement was not packaged completely.  My replacement set did not include individual cardboard envelopes for the three plastic hard cases.  (The holder which holds the three hard cases together was there; but each hard case is further protected by a cardboard envelope, which helps keep them from rubbing against each other in the holder.  This is important; because each hard case has chrome-like lettering which could rub off over time without the added protection.  This is apparently a QC issue wherever the sets are assembled--I do not think Amazon was to blame).  So, regrettably, I returned this set as well.  Just be aware you may receive a set which doesn't contain individual cardboard envelopes for each plastic hard case.  If you can live with that, it's no big deal and you will love this set--I'm just picky!  Star Trek rules!  And thanks again, Amazon, for your superb customer service!
B000HKCRW2|4.0|Not easy to compete with 'echoes',one of my favourite albums of the past 5 years but i think a good follow-up. less edgy, more rythm. <br />Too bad not a 'killing' or 'house of jealous lovers' #2. <br />favourite tracks 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 <br />Go see these guy live they are even better live!!!
B000G759LW|5.0|I remember hearing Christina Aguilera getting married and then a new CD coming out. I wasn't thinking that a lot would come out from this change in her life. However, I was dead wrong. For a while, \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" was a song I could not get into. I remember seeing the video and being very impressed with her voice and early 1900s approach to the song. Eventually, the song grew on me and it is stuck in my head! \\"Still Dirrty\\" and \\"Candyman\\" are great songs to remind of us what Christina once displayed in her older albums. I just listened to \\"Hurt\\" the other day, and it is very touching and persuasive. Christina seems to touch every type of emotion with this CD. There are a lot of pop artists that seem to come off a hot album and then become overhyped on their follow-up CD with one lousy song... I am so glad that Christina has never fit into that mold. I hope Christina stays back in the music industry, basics or not!
0800141601|4.0|There were three medieval/British Isle films released in 1995 -- \\"Braveheart,\\" \\"Rob Roy\\" and \\"First Knight.\\" Mel Gibson's \\"Braveheart\\" is certainly the most epic of the three, but I found it overrated; which isn't to say I don't like it, I just don't feel that it's as great as the hype would suggest. I liked \\"Rob Roy\\" slightly better than \\"Braveheart;\\" it's very adult-oriented, violent and grim, however.<br /><br />I feel the best of the three, believe it or not, was \\"First Knight,\\" a believable take on the King Arthur/Camelot legend starring Sean Connery as Arthur, Richard Gere as Lancelot and Julia Ormond as Guinevere. They get tangled up in a bit of a love triangle.<br /><br />As I said, this is a realistic portrayal of the story so, thankfully, you won't see any of that silly magical jive with Merlin, Excalibur, etc. This explains why so many panned the film, but I don't get their beef, aren't there enough cinematic depictions of the Camelot tale for them to enjoy, like \\"Excalibur\\"? I'll put it this way, \\"First Knight\\" is to the Arthor/Lancelot legend what the film \\"Troy\\" is to the \\"Helen of Troy\\" chronicle.<br /><br />The film caught my fascination right away with the character of Lancelot. He is portrayed as an expert swordsman, drifter, loner and all-around lost soul. The beginning of the picture reveals something integral to understanding his character: Lancelot takes on an intimidating dude in a swordfight contest at a village he just drifted into. After Lancelot prevails, the big guy asks him for advice on how to be as skilled a swordsman as Lancelot. Lancelot tells him that he needs a couple of obvious sword-fighting skills, to which the man confidently replies, \\"I can do that.\\" Then Lancelot tells him the last quality he needs: \\"And you must not care whether you live or die.\\"<br /><br />This is a powerful scene; Gere plays the character very convincingly (in fact, if you hate Gere, this film will give you a new-found respect for him).

B000001FTD|5.0|This album was the second full album with the upstart Joey Belladonna on Pipes for anthrax.  This was also one of the most profound albums of the New York/east coast thrash scene.  Chances are, if you have heard an anthrax son, it's probably from this album.  This layed the way for the next three albums/ep's with I'm the Man, State of Euphoria, and Persistance of Time to come after this.  State of Euphoria was a let down for some fans (not me, I think it is good in it's own way) secondarilly to the tighness of this album.  Highlights include Caught in a Mosh, and the ever powerfull \\"Indians\\".  But the best song on the album is about Judge Dread and \\"I AM THE LAW\\".  Even among these classic tunes, anthrax shows their light side with EFILNIKUFESIN, much like the later tunes like the song \\"startin up a posse\\" or the cover tune \\"friggin in the riggin\\" or the stuff done on S.O.D.   Get this album.  If you saw them live for the first time this summer on tour with rob zombie, welcome to the club!!!!
B000H305U0|4.0|I must say that I was a little sceptical after seeing the title of this album, however, after listening to it I am totally hooked. Justin is so versatile and I think this album showcases that. I like all of the collaborations - they really work. Great effort!
B000FP2OPY|4.0|SUPERNATURAL has a lot going for it:  it is generally spooky, even though the storylines are derived from horror stories we've all seen before, but to the writers and directors credit, they are twisted enough to make them seem fresh again.  We get vampires, urban legends, Wendigos, witches, etc., and our heroes are stout warriors against them.  To reiterate the basic premise, Sam and Dean are brothers who are following in the footsteps of their supernatural investigator father in the quest to find the demon that killed their mother and Sam's girlfriend, while fighting various other horrors along the way.  Jared Padalecki is the sullen younger brother Sam, whose quest for a \\"normal\\" life ends with his lady's murder and his brother's insistence he join him in his quest to find their missing father.  Jensen Ackles is all dimple and macho bravado as Dean, the protective brother who is intent on dedicating his life to his demon demolishing.  While the actors are both adequate, there are times when their affectatious mannerisms grow tedious.  Also, their bickering and oneuppance get repetitious; there's not one episode where they're not arguing about something or differing on just what their goal in life is.  A little less focus on their bickering might have made the series episodes move a little tighter.  Anyway, this is one of the better horror series of recent television history and I did enjoy the first season...and it has a heck of a cliffhanger.  On to season 2 I guess.
B000000Y87|5.0|Sometimes I listen to this recording and I think to myself, \\"Why did I stop taking piano lessons at seven years old?\\" But I am glad that some little boys continued with their lessons; notably Bill Evans.<br /><br />Bill Evans is so understated...so refined...so elegant that some may think he doesn't have an edge. Not true. His edge is refinement. His playing is never heavy handed, it never overtakes the musical situation, it is so subtle and yet so powerful that you just want more and more...<br /><br />I also like the different version of each song. It's funnny how a little twist here and a little there can change the whole feel of a song. I remember how my mother, a classically trained pianist, would rehearse for weeks on end on a certain piece of music. She'd play the piece note for note, chord for chord according to what the sheet music had laid down, and then she would do something really interesting after she had learned the piece, she'd throw the music away and played according to the wants and needs of her own soul.<br /><br />That's the feel I get from this CD. That everyone is playing from their own soul level and yet coming together to be as one for this recording. It's a very powerful recording and it's perfect for early morning writing....mmm...just like what I'm doing now.<br /><br />I may have given up the piano, but I'm glad I still play at another kind of keyboard.<br /><br />Peace & Blessings
B000G75AE8|4.0|Hey, this is a great album! It takes you by the balls and flies you in the air as a flag. Only half point far from their best ever (Reign in Blood) but at least as good as \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\" and \\"South Of Heaven\\"! It's not only pure brutality...this is definetely a piece of art: technique and violence! The alchemy the classic line-up with Dave Lombardo on drums can create is something any other drummer can match...even the great Bostaph! \\"Flesh Storm\\", \\"Skeleton Christ\\", \\"Consferacy\\" and the new classic \\"Cult\\" above all...but do not expect any weak tune...SIMPLY GREAT!!!
0345451325|5.0|Halo: The Fall of Reach <br />By: Eric Nylund <br /> <br />This series of books are based on the popular Xbox game of the same name (Halo) which is set in the future, piting the humans against a strange group of creatures called the Covenant who are bent on destroying the human race. <br /> <br />This first story in the Halo series is the \\"prequel\\" to original Halo story and it tells of how the Spartans came to be and how the Marines and the human race found themselves in such dire straights against the Covenant.  More importantly, it tells of how the Master Chief rose throught the ranks and eventually became the lone Spartan from his platoon. <br /> <br />This has to be the best story that I have ever read.  I literally could not stop turning the pages and was just eating it all up.  I don't own a Xbox because I'm Playstation loyal, but if the books are as good as the games then they sound like pretty awesome games.  I definetly have to give this book a 10/10, it was totally awesome and very well written.
0393039102|5.0|I read this book when it was first published about ten years ago and the moving experience has remained with me since I finished the final sentence. It is an incredibly vivid book that you will not be able to put down.  <br />What Eric Lomax went through as a POW, and his eventual reconciliation with one of his torturers 50 years later displays a depth of humanity that is deeply moving. <br />
B00003CXRM|4.0|Another bizarre entry in the Coen Brothers arsenal, O BROTHER is a thoroughly entertaining if somewhat unusual film.  The story focuses on three prison escapees who are going to Mississippi to collect the 1.2 million dollars supposedly hidden there.  Based on Homer's ODYSSEY, the film involves our three heroes/stooges in some unusual adventures, all leading to a lot of twists in its looney conclusion.  What makes it work is the spirited performances of George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as the escapees; the charming bluegrass music including the surprise smash hit I AM A MAN OF CONSTANT SORROW and some nice bits from supporting players John Goodman and Holly Hunter.  It has some Three Stooges touches, and is filmed quite beautifully.  All in all, a weird but enjoyable comedy.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins hereby debunks nearly all (that I can tell) common arguments for the existence of a god, and lays out the case that all organization among lifeforms and the universe itself can be attributed to natural processes, and that a universe endowed with a meddlesome god would look much different than the one we have now. His arguments are effective and valid, although this is not a work for the layperson, as its language is complex and he goes into much detail, sometimes sapping it of a possible concisive and effective punch that would be more effective for converting the average non-intellectual Christian. But for sophisticated atheists, deists, or theists, this will give you much to think about.
B000H4JGZY|1.0|Very Vanilla sounding throughout - like so much of today's general music. Why it was Rolling Stones' number one for Oct 19 2006 I don't know, there are better CDs.  Where is the originality?  Where are the catchy melodic musical hooks? Whole thing sounds like a Michael Jackson voice imitation, esp \\"Damn Girl.\\"  Very monotone throughout with one song running into another without excitement.  Overall a boring album.  JT can do better. I think the guy has talent but he needs some good songs (words), sound engineering (mix), and a great backup band or music with \\"jump in your face\\" hooks - stuff that says \\"I'm Different\\" from the pack.  He needs to avoid this \\"common sounding\\" trend, and stand out from the crowd.  But I guess this is what the public is buying these days since he was number one, or maybe they had no real option out there (too much of this type music exists).  But how about making music that stands the test of time?  Who will listen to this album in ten years?  Will any one \\"given song\\" actually survive the test of time?  Unfortunately I think not.  Too bad.  The guy can do much better.  I guess we have surrendered to massive CD sales to 12 year olds and forgotten artistic perspectives and real creativity. If you are a true musician, you will agree and push JT to seek out his true potential more. I'm rooting for you JT.  Go for it.
B000002JKA|5.0|Awake followed close on the heels of the massively successful (as far as Prog rock albums went in that era, anyway) Images and Words.  <br /> <br />Most people equate earlier Dream Theater with lighter material, and latter/current albums with a darker, heavier feel. However, Awake defies that stereotype. There's nothing on here that's anywhere near as heavy as The Glass Prison or Panic Attack (not to mention the whole of Train of Thought,) but there are many tracks that took most early DT fans by surprise. The band had never before shown the startling intensity that is displayed in this album, notably on \\"The Mirror\\", \\"Voices\\", \\"6:00\\", and \\"Caught in a Web\\".  <br /> <br />Portnoy, Petrucci, and Myung are just as mindblowing as always, though their talents aren't given as much room to shine as they are in later albums. The real star of this album is--for once--James LaBrie. His voice is in top shape here and on \\"The Mirror\\" his performance sends shivers down the spine. As has been mentioned before, there is a section in \\"Innocence Faded\\" where he absolutely nails an F above the staff, which is all but unheard of! LaBrie gets sold short far too often--he is an amazing singer. <br /> <br />All in all, Awake is an excellent album and is certainly worthy to be placed among the pantheon of Dream Theater masterpieces. I believe it to be better than Images and Words, though it doesn't reach the grand, soaring atmosphere and perfect mix of heavy and light that Scenes From a Memory achieves.  <br /> <br />Having said that, I do have a few complaints about the album. First of all, this is not a good album to start listening to DT with, as it's somewhat of an anomoly.  <br /> <br />Secondly, I'm aware that I may be in the minority here, but I FAR prefer Jordan Rudess' playing to Moore's. Being a keyboard player in a band myself, who shares equal responsibility for solos and riff-pounding with the guitars--as Rudess does in recent DT albums--I find his playing to be much more satisfying. He brings the keyboards to the forefront and really makes them an integral part of the band, whereas Moore tends to be like most keyboard players--hanging in the back, adding some light flourishes. However, Moore's playing on Space Dye Vest is really wonderful. All in all, though, I just miss Rudess' virtuoso ability, even though Moore came first.  <br /> <br />Finally, it may seem like an odd complaint, but I find the album to have a few too many tracks on it. Dream Theater is not musical fast food. It requires the listener to truly listen. While Awake is lacking in epic pieces that are a staple of Dream Theater, it reaches about the same length in terms of album time, but only does so by adding one or two tracks that are somewhat lackluster by Dream Theater standards. Awake is, to date, the only Dream Theater album that has any \\"filler\\" at all on it.  <br /> <br />Despite that nitpicking, Awake is overall a marvelous album and any fan of Dream Theater - or great music in general - should own it.
B0000AK7AA|3.0|There's nothing really awful about this big budget version of the classic comic/cartoon series; there's also nothing really great about it either.  In transporting the friendly spook into the modern realm, we get okay effects and a few laughs, but nothing to earn it classic status.  This time, Casper and his naughty trio of friends haunt an old manor recently inherited by a greedy woman and her cohort.  A treasure is supposedly hidden within its walls, so she hires a ghost \\"shrink\\" and his precocious teenage daughter to rid the house of the spooks.  Kids will probably find it amusing, although there is some strong language and sexual innuendo.  Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci try gamely to make it work, and they're adequate but it's really Cathy Moriarty in her best Cruela Deville impersonation who steals the acting honors.<br /><br />All harmless fun but it didn't inspire any sequels so that should tell you something.
B000HD1AEA|5.0|I am usually quite miffed when Sarah and Nettwerk decide to re-release old Sarah songs but in this case I am *very* happy! This two-disc edition of \\"Mirrorball\\" is perfect for long-time Sarah fans as it covers her first four (and best) albums and it isn't as polished as the 1999 release. The sound quality is excellent and it almost feels like being at a McLachlan concert. An excellent addition for die-hard Sarah fans!
B000008HPE|5.0|I grew up in the 80's and this was a hip band. I originally bought this on cassette and recently looked to get it on CD. Amazon had a great price and I decided to go \\"Back in time\\". The music was as I remembered, great! I like the non-hits alot on this CD. I know radio wouldnt play them so they sit unless you are a fan. \\"Whole lotta lovin\\", \\"Simple as that\\", and \\"I know what I like\\" are just a few. I really enjoy \\"Naturally\\" which is accapella. I wish HLN would put out a CD of all accapella music. I guess you could say that \\"FORE'S\\"  hits were played out in the 80's. They feel fresh again, though. GO BACK!
B000063JDE|5.0|Lynch fills out the world of Blue Velvet so lovingly, and with such care and imagination, and attention to detail (and to the odd, essential quirks of life), that, surreal as it is, this world seems wholly authentic to us. Because Lynch is not afraid to \\"dream' his movies, he fills his world with the kind of \\"abritrary' touches that make up real life. And his mise en scene here, far from being merely the backdrop to his \\"plot,\\" is actually central to it (and even takes precedence over it). The one grows organically out of the other, in fact, for, as in all true myths (and in dreams also), the two are inseparable. Because in life, there is no plot, obviously (save that written by God, or Chance), only an endless, infinite and unimaginably intricate unfolding of scenes, acts, events, encounters, gestures, words, sounds, smells. In a word--phenomena, endlessly spilling out and colliding and spinning off and resounding with all the crazy random beauty of pollen in the wind. There may be patterns in such chaos, but if so, they are infinite, varied, and eternally overlapping, interacting. And so the patterns we choose to isolate are simply that: their meanings is merely the meaning we have chosen to impose upon the chaos. For Lynch, the mystery of the world is inseparable from the mystery of us--the mystery of perceiving, which is the greatest mystery of them all. Something is out there, Lynch seems to be saying, because something is making us perceive. It's up to us, then, to seek it out, and even if we know we can never hope to understand it, we can at least try. What else are we here for? The alternative is simply too dull, too dispiriting, to entertain--that's there's nothing out there, nothing hidden or inexplicable, and that what we think is all there is. (The insanity of solipcism is the only thing that's unthinkable in Lynch's world.)  To Lynch, the options are plain--either we know it all, and the answers are just what we choose to invent, in which case there's no sense in asking questions at all. Or--we know nothing, and no answers are possible, so all there is for us to do is ask the most exciting, enchanting, impossibly impertinent questions we can dream up. To Lynch, the world is a strange world, not because we do not understand it, but because that's the way it is--it's nothing but strangeness, that's what makes it the world (such stuff as dreams are made of). Since, for Lynch, there is nothing stranger than \\"normality,\\" so, by the same token, the strange is the only \\"normal\\" thing there is. And seeing as we have made the world thus, by perceiving it, interpreting and assembling it, piece by piece, with our own thoughts and senses, then we must be mysteries, too.<br /><br />With Blue Velvet, Lynch succeeds in perhaps the highest single accomplishment art can aspire to (at a human level, anyway): he shows us that, if reality is a dream and dream reality, then we, as both the dreamers and the dream, are the ultimate unfathomables: we are strangers to ourselves.<br /><br />see [....]o sense in asking questions at all.

B00005JP87|5.0|This is the sleeper film of 2006 and so far, the best all-around production of the year.  It has elements of many other films, without any overt recollections of any of them, and yet it is original and significant in it's own right.  It is more like a Sherlock Holmes story than anything else, yet it borrows from Romeo and Juliet.  It has elements harkening back to Deneuve's MAYERLING, yet without the dazzling glamour.  All actors perform flawlessly.  Edward Norton evokes the brilliance he displayed in PRIMAL FEAR and establishes himself--permanently--as one of our foremost thespians.  Rufus Sewell as Prince Leopold, subtley depicts the off-center arrogance and instability that was characteristic of the real Prince Rudolph.  This is Paul Giammati's finest performance to date.If you insist that a film have a plot (and this one does), follows it clearly, and not leave loose ends or dropped leitmotivs, then you will appreciate this well-focused effort. Nothing distracts from the plot, even scenery and costumes are subordinated to the storyline, and as such, draw you into not only the story, but make you feel as though you are there in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Eisenheim is developed in such a way, that he transcends himself, achieving such metaphysical identification, that he becomes an enigmatic, inscrutable, demi-god, feared and respected, and the apparent conduit of the righteous vengeance of the unjustly dead.  While appearing to be the victim in the piece, he is in fact the master puppeteer who makes everything right.
0307346609|5.0|I recently gave this book to my brother for his birthday and after reading it, he demanded that I do the same. I had just finished Cormac McCarthy's The Road and wasn't really interested in another \\"post-apocolyptic\\" story, but as I started to read World War Z I became so engrossed that I read it all in one night. This book felt so real and frightening that it has stayed with me ever since I finished the last page. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, even those who think they won't like it. It's powerful writing mixed with unlimited imagination. All the characters are so distinct and their stories told with such urgency and emotion. I read in the author's Bio that he used to write for SNL and I can't believe that a comedy writer could keep me up for several nights in a row for fear of Zombie's attacking me. BRAVO! Do yourself a favor and read this book in the daylight. 5 Stars!
B000002KDO|5.0|Iommi and company took the world by storm with their first two releases. Their critical third in my opinion threw them over the top. From the opening coughs of \\"Sweet Leaf\\", to the last drum beat of \\"Into The Void\\", the entire album is killer. They were able to play both sides of the coin on this one, with \\"After Forever\\" willing people to look at what their doing and realize that \\"God is the one\\", to the flip side with an ode to the Devil himself on \\"Lord Of This World\\" (read the lyrics to that one to see what I mean). The album happens to contain two Sabbath favorites of mine, the aforementioned Into The Void, as well as Embryo/Children Of The Grave. Highly recommended, do go out and buy it now, if it's not in your collection already.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Sigur Ros are one of our very best and most special bands, and this album is no different. Some detractors had said that after () they looked like they may have been caught in the same sort of trap that many post-rock bands get caught in, the loud-soft-loud syndrome. Takk answers this charge by containing, to my ears at least, a fair deal more diversity. Though that really seems almost meaningless when the songs are as beautiful as they are. Takk/Glosoli exemplifies this. I was shocked the first time I heard the crescendo and explosion towards the end of this track, and knew great things awaited. What makes the album so great is that it contains so many extremes. Glosoli contains a subtle sense of innocence and joy (indeed one of the most striking images from its music video is that of a small girl kissing a small boy on the cheek), and the sense of grandeur that is so often invoked on the album (Saeglopur), and also the sorrow and longing (the 10+ minute Milano-that never seems to drag-and the amazing Andvari) just here create a total experience. It is music not for life, but rather it illuminates life. They, in their most profound moments, allow you to view and identify with all that is beautiful, and sorrowful, and terrible and majestic, making their music in my mind far from \\"weird\\" as many put it, but rather intensely human.<br /><br />After many repeat listenings, the song that stands out as perhaps the greatest achievement on the album is Heysatan. I once read the following:<br /><br />  \\"Kjartan (Sigur ros' drummer) said concerning haysatan, 'With Heys&aacute;tan  my idea of it after we wrote it, was that there was an old man looking over his field, a big view over the sea or something, and he is dying. He is going to die. He is just lying on the grass, and he is going to die, but that is fine because he has had a good life. He is quite happy dying, actually. And that is what the song is to me. It's kind of that emotion.'\\"<br /><br />listen to the song again after reading that. The song is a phenomenal end to this tremendous album, because it is filled with contentment, not unrestrained joy, nor the somberness of some of the preceeding songs. It's sitting on the front porch on a balmy summer night as the crickets just begin to wake for the night, and the sun slowly, but surely, sinks inexorably out of sight.<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended<br /><br />As an addendum, you NEED to see this band live. I saw them play in chicago and shelling out $150 for a pair of front row tickets felt like the greatest bargain of my life. Their music live is just on another plane. The song \\"Hafsol\\" performed (and the show as a whole) is one of the greatest things I've even been able to see.ing that.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Without reservation, the best sci-fi TV show I've ever seen.  This show hearkens back to some of the themes of classic Heinlein - a strong libertarian streak, the concept that livestock is a cheaper way to do work on the frontier (even frontier planets) than advanced, high-tech machinery, and of course, the strong belief in the ability of an individual to make a difference and choose the right path on his own - but also the need to be allowed to choose his path, right or wrong, without being forced into something he disagrees with \\"for his own good.\\"  <br /> <br />I do have to say that this is not a show that necessarily grabs you from the first instant.  At its heart, the crew is a family, and as we've all found, sometimes feeling as though you belong to a new family can take a little while.  It doesn't take long, though, before you really start relating to the crew, each a complex individual (well, except maybe for Jayne...the man they call Jayne), and very different from each other - yet it's not hard to see how they all have come together as a group, not just a collection of people on the same boat.  While you can summarize each person fairly briefly, they're all much more than stock one dimensional characters, as evidenced (for example) by River pausing in one of her surreal ramblings to make a classic little sister crack to her brother. <br /> <br />The DVD is very well done, as well, with commentaries on literally half of the episodes.  Many of the commentaries avoid the common \\"oh look at this shot, I like the sound balance here\\" overly technical commentary that I often see.  Granted, a lot of the crew on shows don't get the credit that they deserve, but listening to a director basically thank every member of the crew doesn't make for a very entertaining commentary.  Instead, commentators reminisce about favorite moments, memorable lines, funny BTS stories, and (in the case of Nathon Fillion and Alan Tudyk) sometimes even joking about the show as they go.  Likewise, the deleted scenes avoid the usual formula \\"Let's have 38 different shots of someone forgetting their line and swearing about it while everyone laughs.\\" Instead, the deleted scenes show people goofing off on the set, really showcasing the great relationships between the cast members. <br /> <br />Having been introduced to the show via this DVD set, I can recommend it to anyone who likes good sci-fi and anyone who enjoys seeing good character interaction.  As I said in my title, this show represents the best of intelligent, character-driven sci-fi...and unfortunately, that's probably why it was cancelled in favor of the reality show of the week.
B000EULJLU|3.0|GEE - I would REALLY LOVE to be able to write a GOOD review for my favorite bands... unfortunately, I've not been able to for a long time.  (Korn, Rob Zombie, Rammstein, Godsmack, etc.)<br /><br />NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE SAYING THIS ABOUT TOOL THOUGH!!  This albums Sucks!  ESPECIALLY compared to their earlier work.  COMPARED TO: Lateralus, it's even MORE - softer, less fluid (melodically), lyrical direction just slams to a hault - I really have NOTHING good to say about this album, except:<br /><br />The Packaging was at least \\"interesting\\" though ultimately LAME... there are a couple of MEDIOCRE TO GOOD songs on the Album - the rest is just plain [...]!<br /><br />The songs are all pretty much 8 - 12 minutes long! -- which wouldn't be THAT bad... if there were good & powerful MAYNARD style LYRICS, and TOOL style  ~Flowing - Melodic - Rythmic - Music to go with it, like in Ænima - and even periodically in Lateralus...... but no - almost NOTHING like that in this album.<br /><br />The MUSIC - as I said, lacks DIRECTION & the Tool style Seamlessly Flowing Melodies... the LYRICS - lack POWER, Direction as well, and also the flow that use to go with the music in previous albums is gone as well....... where in past albums - Maynard's Voice / Lyrics flowed & fit so well with the Music ---- now - it's just a TRAIN WRECK, and sounds like an album full of \\"Lullabies\\" for lack of a better term.<br /><br />In my opinion - For Maynard:  too much time spent writing for & singing w/ A Perfect Circle  - For the Band:  too much time in \\"Limbo\\" between records, and have lost touch with their Musical reality.<br /><br />Obviously a Must Have for TOOL fans --- everyone else, Buy \\"Ænima\\", \\"Undertow\\", \\"Lateralus\\"... and if you've got the extra cash... definitely check out \\"Salival\\" CD & \\"Opiate\\".<br /><br />Added Dec 21st:  I have to admit, SOME of the songs have grown on me... but for the most part - my original review stands.  I think I know why they've \\"slipped\\" so much...<br /><br />I read an interview they did in Revolver Magazine - they said when writing the Music, they analyze, re-analyze - think & re-think every single note, etc. etc.  Well, there's the problem!!  Music should FLOW from within, it's about EMOTION - you can't think, & over think - continualy SECOND-GUESS everything --- when that happens, well, you get this album!  I'm not saying - write whatever comes to mind & leave it at that... there's obviously rough drafts, and then they're cleaned up, revamped, whatever --- but you simply can NOT think your music to death... or you'll KILL IT... and that's precisely what's going on here.<br /><br />The LYRICS should be well thought out... after all, it's the lyrics which make us think, react, etc. -- the music should FLOW, EMOTE, GROW & LIVE... the music, for the most part - is not only how I described it earlier... but sometimes sounds like a rat trapped in a maze, desperately trying to find the cheese..... but sadly never quite gets there.  The Lyrics are the ONLY thing that have managed to salvage this album & make it 3 Stars, instead of 1 or 2.  This truely cannot go on if Tool expect to survive... which I hope to God they do!<br /><br />-- Also, I know Maynard doesn't want his vocals being the \\"main attraction\\" & wants the music to be just as important (if not more so); but man... Maynard can be barely heard most of the time on this album... his vocals are mixed, way, way down... and often times are completely drowned out &/or practically inaudible... Half the time, you know he's singing... you can hear the vocal melody... but good luck trying to actually hear & discern what he's singing about!!<br /><br />Please Guys, FEEL the Music, don't THINK it.  That's what made the Undertow & Ænima (and even SOME parts of Lateralus) so good.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|Get over yourselves, P!ATD fans! This band is far from legendary, and they only have one album out! The music is just rehashed from already rehashed pop-punk and just tries to look unique with their lengthy song titles concepts taken from real screamo bands like City of Caterpillar, An Albatross, The Number 12 Looks Like You, etc. Don't expect this band to be around much longer. We seriously didn't need another copy of \\"Under The Cork Tree\\".<br /><br />If they do make another album, expect it to be an exact replica of this album. Usually, I don't care much if a band sounds similar to one another, but if it's trendy pop-punk or radio rock which I already hate, it needs to go.
0618680004|5.0|This book dazzles with intelligence and insight, cutting through the myriad confusions of ancient superstition like a knife through soft butter. If humanity is to avoid the ghastly religious wars that plagued it in the past, this is the message it needs. But the message may not get through: unfortunately religious crazies of all stripes, whether they reside in caves or mansions, hang on to their delusions with manic obsession. They counter every argument with confused obfuscation.  <br /> <br />Also unfortunately, the likes of Dawkins don't come often--evolution hasn't favored us in that respect. He shows what human intelligence free of mystical shackles is capable of doing. A brilliant read, don't miss it.  <br />
068817776X|4.0|This memoir is pretty well written and as such is a very quick read. I won't go into the details of the story, as the book is inexpensive and you really should just pick it up to read yourself, since nothing a reviewer could tell you will match up with the actual memoir. Suffice to say that her story is as heartbreaking in some regards as you would expect a narrative like this to be. My only complaint is that it is perhaps lacking a little depth in some areas, specifically in regards to what happened to her after the war, how she reintegrated herself into a post-WWII Europe. I also would have liked more on what she learned about the experiences of people she knew and loved, as well as how her views of events have changed over the years since they occurred. Still, like every survivor's story, this is a valuable addition in my journey to understand the holocaust and its effects on individuals, families, and communities.
0062502182|5.0|WARNING: The Alchemist is one of my favorite books. In fact, it was my inspiration when I set off on the journey to make my own dream come true--to realize my own \\"Personal Legend\\". The original was written in Portugese so what we see is a translation.    In March of 2006 I ordered from an Amazon third party vendor a copy of The Alchemist to give as a gift to a friend. On the cover of the book that I received from the third party vendor were the words \\"This edition for sale only on the Indian sub-continent\\". The warning is printed there for a purpose.    Imagine my surprise when I went to underline some favorite sections for my friend and found the wording completely different. Part of the book's charm is the use of the term \\"Personal Legend\\". The Indian edition translation did not use this term. It used \\"destiny\\" instead, which is not nearly as colorful as \\"Personal Legend\\". On inspection, I noticed other differences in the translation. Cultural differences account for the translation differences.    The vendor ignored my communications with him about this. I received a refund only after I complained to Amazon that what I received is not what was offered for sale. For full enjoyment and to appreciate this wonderful book MAKE SURE THAT YOU PURCHASE THE US EDITION AND NOT AN EDITION FROM A DIFFERENT CULTURE at a cheaper price.
B0001JXQDI|4.0|..Then you'll appreciate this follow-up.  'Aja' opened me up to other music outside the AOR genre by gently stretching Dan's pop hooks into neo-jazz.  By 'Gaucho', There really wasn't much pretense that Steely Dan was an actual band anymore---it was Becker and Fagen and a studio. And that was OK.  This album is the logical progression along the path that SD was on from the beginning---popular music with a twist that has held up well over time.  'Gaucho' still sounds fresh twenty years down the road.
B00005JPAD|3.0|What was the point of re-making Hong Kong's legendary \\"Infernal Affairs\\", only released 5 years ago?    During \\"The Departed\\", I kept waiting to see some sort of adaptation or stylistic/creative addition to the movie, since people kept saying it was 'loosely adapted', or 'a creative remake'. NOPE. Aside from the city/culture change, 90% of it is a scene-for-scene complete copy/rip-off of the original movie. Even many of the jokes and plot devices were exactly translated.    The 'screenwriter' Moyahan should only be credited with the title 'Translator', re-writing the script from Mandarin to English. Also, Scorsesse is a flat out liar. He claims to have never seen 'Infernal Affairs', but there are so many similarities shot-wise that it's clear he basically copied the original movie. What was the point of remaking it? So basically, the only reason they redid the movie was seemingly to change the ethnicity of the cast.    God forbid Asian cinema get recognition and screen time in American theaters. Hollywood colonialism has to continue its reign by re-shooting great foreign movies, but with White actors, and giving practically no acknowledgement to its original Asian creators. In the credits, Moyahan is solely credited with the script, even though it is a 90% exact copy. On top of that, what was with the racist remarks and scenes against Asians in this movie? Way to go out of your way to offend the people who you copied from.    The worst of it is, 'The Departed' is already being called one of the best 100 movies ever, and a potential Oscar winner, while 'Infernal Affairs' got no play in US theaters when it came out, and gets no recognition or accolades, even though the remake is a scene-for-scene rip off of the original. Why was Alan Mak completely left off the writing credit in the movie credits? For those who haven't seen both movies, don't bother commenting, because you'll come off as ignorant and uninformed.
B00005N9CV|3.0|This is a wonderful album of jazz pop standards with flawless execution and Diana Krall's wonderful voice and distinct time signatures. Trouble is: the strings.<br /><br />The strings add to the lush sound, but if you mentally remove them and reduce these arrangements to just the other instrument's voices, you get a better album and songs that could be executed in the smoky club of your scotch blurred memories where you fell in love with jazz in the first place. Sure they went to the expense of sweetening the sound with the strings, and probably increased market share in the process, but it turned an excellent album into a good album.<br /><br />Jazz has had too many tragedies to add to the pile.
B00005JKGK|3.0|The author Amy Tan is an Asian female 'Uncle Tom' (look up the term) for her garbage called the 'Joy Luck Club'. It portrays all Asian men in a made-up, negative light, while causing her Asian female protagonists to marry White men, who even cheat on them in the movie, but that doesn't stop the Asian girls from staying with them.    Amy Tan is a self hating Asian female. She is like some Asian girls who grew up hating the fact that she looked so different from her classmates/peers, and fit in however way she could by acting White, and wanting only White men. Personally, she has been massively depressed most of her life (look it up), and has had a terrible marriage with a Caucasian. In her books, she tries to justify her life decisions by portraying White men as White knights, and Asian men as controlling and oppressive, when that couldn't be farther from the truth.    Amy Tan set Asian men and women back decades in this country. How come in Hollywood flicks we see mostly see Black-Black couples, or Latin-Latin couples, but the Asian women are always with a White guy? It seems like every TV show and movie in the past ten years pairs an Asian girl with a White guy romatically. Asian men are being completely suppressed in television and film. Amy tan helped glamorize the exclusive Asian female/White male pairing that is everywhere on TV, movies, and commercials these days, at the complete suppression of Asian men.    These shows affect kids. Teens, especially girls, judge themselves on others' opinions, and are easily influenced. Young, insecure Asian girls are conditioned through social norms/media to 'act White' and want only White men, and young Asian American boys growing up in the US are conditioned to think they are unattractive.    Have you ever met any Asian families!? The Asian men are predominantly kind, quiet, giving, loving husbands, and providing fathers, and their WIVES make almost all the decisions (at least in Chinese culture). I'm tired of hearing false oppression crap about Asian men from White people, and brain-washed Asian girls, just to make us unattractive in their minds. Also, here's a FACT, not a generalization - as a group, Asian men have the highest average education and income, combined with the lowest avg rates of murder, theft, infidelity, spousal abuse, rape, child molestation, divorce, and crime in this country.
B0000009RT|5.0|Freak Out! - released as a two-album set in 1966, is a lot more than Zappa's debut, it is a profound achievement of modern music that belongs in any collection worthy of the name.  Were you to own only one Mothers/Zappa CD - (a mistake) - this would have to be it.  Forty years have passed since it was unleashed upon an unsuspecting world and it is every bit as fresh and fascinating today as it was then.<br /><br />Zappa defies categorization, but for want of anywhere else to put him, he was lumped in with rock musicians.  Consider then who is on this album.  Les McCann, Paul Butterfield, Mac Rebennack (Dr. John), 5 credits for cello, 2 French horn credits, Motorhead Sherwood on \\"noises,\\" Kim Fowley on \\"hypophone,\\" among many, many others.  What none of us fully appreciated at the time was that Zappa was a truly modern classical composer whose repertoire included rock.<br /><br />In an era dominated by breezy romantic ballads, Zappa introduced biting anti-love love songs like I Ain't Got No Heart, How Could I Be Such A Fool?, and my personal favorite, I'm Not Satisfied.  He also showed us his belligerent, downright hostile side in songs like, You're Probably Wondering Why I'm Here.  Who Are The Brain Police?, and Trouble Every Day, showed a highly politicized Zappa who never met an authority figure he didn't despise.  Even in catchy, upbeat numbers like Motherly Love, another favorite, he couldn't resist the temptation to be puerile, off-color, and offensive - this weakness would dog him throughout his career.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, it is the songs we skipped over in 1966 that have the most enduring impact; in 1966 they were unintelligible.  Eight minutes of Help, I'm A Rock, four of It Can't Happen Here, and twelve minutes of The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet charted territory that was distant indeed considering that, back then,  the Kingston Trio was considered hip.  All three were amazing, but in Magnet what you had was pedal-to-the-metal Dada-ist musical theater of the absurd, delivered in very responsible 4/4 time.<br /><br />No matter how far out Zappa got in later years, the entirety of his splendidly cracked and thoroughly original vision is right here.  And remember folks, Zappa claimed that he didn't take drugs, which means he was this weird naturally!d, delivered in very responsible 4/4 time.    No matter how far out Zappa got in later years, the entirety of his splendidly cracked and thoroughly original vision is right here.  And remember folks, Zappa claimed that he didn't take drugs, which means he was this weird naturally!

B00005JPAD|5.0|\\"The Departed\\" is one of those films you need to savor. Full of rich performances, attention to detail and lots of plot, you will probably need to see this new Scorcese film at least twice to be able to fully appreciate everything. One of the best films of the year.<br /><br />Young Colin Sullivan lives in a poor, rough neighborhood in Boston. As he struggles with life in this neighborhood, he notices a gangster by the name of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) who seems to have the world in his pocket. Costello helps the young man and soon, Colin (Matt Damon) has enrolled in the police academy. Also entering the academy, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), another young man from the same neighborhood, has joined the police for a different reason; he wants to do some good. Upon graduation, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), two officers in the Massachusetts State Police, approach Billy and ask him to go undercover in Costello's organization. They are running a secret operation and no one but Queenan and Dignam will know Billy's true identity. Soon, each is working their way up through the individual organizations, providing information to help the other side. Then, one day, Colin learns of a possible informant in Costello's organization and informs his benefactor. Frank becomes skittish and asks Billy to help locate the mole. At the same time, Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), Colin's supervisor, asks him to help locate Costello's mole. Will each learn about the other?<br /><br />Directed by Martin Scorcese and featuring a wealth of actors working at the top of their craft, \\"The Departed\\" is a great film. Based on a Hong Kong movie called \\"Infernal Affairs\\", Scorcese and company have added moments of humor, violence, sexuality, twists and suspense creating a very different experience. The original film featured a number of long cat and mouse chase sequences which are hinted at here, but are largely forgone in favor of more character development, creating a richer, more interesting film.<br /><br />Any time you have a film and Mark Wahlberg is the fourth lead, taking a co-starring role, you know you are in for at least an interesting experience. This film has an incredible cast. But there have been many flops with incredible casts. The difference here is that each and every one of the leads could be in a film about their character alone and that film would be very good. But combining all four has created one of the best films of 2006.<br /><br />Nicholson is outstanding and back in fine form, playing the over confident, powerful, sociopath gangster Frank Costello. Costello runs the neighborhood where he grew up and when that becomes too confining for him, he moves into other areas of Boston. Ruling with an iron fist, using fear and intimidation to control, he works with a loyal crew, but he is not without his problems. Exhibiting erratic behavior (a kind understatement), Frank will kill you before he asks questions if he suspects you of informing on him. The performance is just slightly over the top, scary and menacing. There is a beautiful scene in which Costello enters a bar from a backroom to address his crew who is hanging out. His lower shirt sleeves covered in blood. He addresses Billy and his team and then yells \\"Bring a mop\\" and heads back to finish the business he started off-screen.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a young man with a troubled family past. Upon graduation from the academy, he is approached and asked to take on this dangerous assignment particularly because of that troubled past. DiCaprio does a great job as well. Most of the time, this type of role would be played with a poker face, nothing getting through the rough exterior of the character, but DiCaprio plays the role with more emotion, making him more human. Every time he witnesses a murder, it shocks him. If someone double crosses him, he can't figure it out and is taken aback. In other words, every emotion crosses his face. Ina way, this makes sense. If I were Costello, I would want someone who was a human working for me. It would make them more vulnerable to threats, should the need arise.<br /><br />Later in the film, as Costigan becomes further isolated, he turns to the one woman he knows, Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) for comfort. Their relationship is passionate, but Madolyn is in a relationship with another man, so she can't fully commit to him, even though she would probably prefer to.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays the other Southie, Colin Sullivan. As Costello's plant, he walks a fine line throughout; he has to keep his boss happy, and keep him informed, but he also has to do his job and make sure he is never suspected. Throughout the film, Damon brings a believable sense of nervousness to the character, making him always appear on edge. Also, as Colin is promoted by his supervisor, Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), he has to hide his sense of contempt for his superiors; he can't believe how dumb they are.<br /><br />Damon also does a great job of turning on the charm as Colin. Setting his eye on Madolyn, a police psychologist, he flirts with her and literally charms the pants off of her. As they build a relationship, his conflict increases.<br /><br />These are easily two of the best performances from Damon and DiCaprio. Each has had an impressive career, but in Scorcese's hands, they show they can handle difficult, multi-faceted roles. We don't necessarily like either, but Damon is especially susceptible to our scorn. Yet, somehow we care about both. Even as we watch Damon's character doing despicable things, we have seen the influences in his life and recognize how these have shaped him.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg is memorable as Dingman, the foot soldier for Sheen's Queenan. They have worked together for a long time to erase corruption in the department and to catch Costello and have a strong bond. Dingman has little time for questions and doesn't believe a lot of people. The first meeting between he and Costigan is especially memorable, as Dingman does little but swear. Even so, he gets his feelings across.<br /><br />Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone round out this great cast.  What more can be said of Martin Scorcese that hasn't already been said? Easily, one of the greatest filmmakers ever, he has had some missteps in his career, but overall, you can count on a Scorcese film to grab you by the throat and take you for a ride. \\"The Departed\\" is no exception.<br /><br />Just about every great director can be easily associated with one or two frequent collaborators who have helped them achieve their status. Hitchcock had Cary Grant, James Stewart and Bernard Herman. John Ford had John Wayne. Billy Wilder had his frequent screenplay collaborator I.A.L. Diamond. Scorcese has Thelma Schoonmaker, his longtime editor. This is frequently one of the best things about Scorcese's films, the editing. It always successfully helps to evoke the mood of the feeling. In \\"Raging Bull\\", they created a unique style for each fight. In \\"The Age of Innocence\\", the editing was slower, more languorous to match the tone of the film. In \\"The Departed\\", they create a frenzied, visceral experience, cutting back and forth between the two characters and their lives. Sometimes, we watch the two people in different worlds at the same time. Yet, Scorcese and Schoonmaker always keep us in the thick of things. Throughout, there are brief glimpses of crime scene photos, murders, etc., providing us with a brief, but memorable visual match to what the characters are talking about. These shots are so brief; we have to wonder if they actually appeared. It is almost as though the filmmakers are giving us a test, to see if we are paying attention. Showing these things for such a brief period is akin to the experience of reading a book; our mind has to fill in the details and our mind does a frighteningly good job.<br /><br />My one complaint is that during a montage of scenes, the lastframe of each scene is held for a couple of seconds, giving the feeling of stop motion. It doesn't seem effective and draws us out of the picture. Thankfully, this is only done once. But this is a small complaint in a film this good.<br /><br />There has already been a lot of comparison between this film and \\"Goodfellas\\". I think this does this film a disservice. \\"Goodfellas\\" is an acknowledged classic and I don't think \\"The Departed\\" has had enough time to rise to that level. Yet. Perhaps, with time and upon reflection, this new Scorcese film will earn a place alongside the other. I'm not sure yet. They are very different films. \\"Goodfellas\\" told a story about one group. \\"The Departed\\" follows two separate groups working against one another. I'm pretty sure \\"The Departed\\" will be remembered as one of Scorcese's best, but that comes with time. No film is a true classic when it is first released. We have to wait.

0307346609|5.0|A friend who loved this book recommended I read it even though I'm not a big fan of Zombie films/books. I was very happy he did. It was a very compelling book that even a non-Zombie person like me actually could not put down. I hope the Zombie war never comes, but if does, at least we now know the horror we can expect!
B000094DUP|5.0|I first heard of Delta Goodrem's Album 'Innocent Eyes' and 'Mistaken Identity' about two years ago, and I still can't stop listening to them. One of the first things I heard about Delta was that she fought and won her battle with cancer. Not doing much research, I assumed it to be true with a few of her titles in her albums. All of her songs have tone of true emotion, letting us feel as she does. It is a shame that she doesn't have much of a fan base here in the US. I'm willing to pay the extra for her import.
B00005B36H|5.0|One of the best albums in my collection.  A powerful album with great songs.  The title track Lateralus is probably the best song on the album.  It doesn't rock as much as Undertow or Opiate, but I think this album captures the true spirit of the band.  Get punched in the face with the Grudge, then mellow out a bit, then get hit with Schism and Parabola, then go into 30 minutes of deep trance.  Awesome!  What a perfect album.  I think some of the reviewers don't like this album because it isn't true \\"Progressive rock\\". You're right it isn't. But that doesn't mean that the album is a failure. They should try to feel this album instead of trying to desect it.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I have never rated every song of an album with 5 stars before in my iTunes music library. <br /> <br />John Mayer's Continuum was almost the first.. ten 5-stars and two 4-stars. But still the best album I've ever rated. This is a revolutionary album. Blues with a modern alternative twist. Mayer's a fricking genius. <br /> <br />'Infinitely playable', as he says. On first listen, songs appear to be similar. But just give it a little more patience and you'll drown in the wonderful electric guitar chords. <br /> <br />Buy it. I already did. This might be the album of the decade.
B000EULJLU|2.0|I bought this album the day it came out and was thuroughly disappointed.  I wanted to write a bad review then, but decided to wait a few months and give the album a chance to redeam itself.  Well, it's been a few months and I've listened to the album a few more times.  If this was the first Tool album, then I think I would give it some praise because Tool's sound is just so unique.  However, after listening to Lateralus (a masterpiece), Undertow, Aenima, and Opiate, this album simply doesn't measure up.  It sounds like the Lateralus B-sides that never made the cut.  Some of the songs have huge potential, but never turn into anything worth remembering.  I would expect more from this great band.  I don't understand how Tool fans can like this album. Is the \\"happy smoke\\" clouding your judgement?  It is such a let down.  Tool are still one of my favorite bands, and Lateralus is still one of the best albums in my collection.  if you are still curious about this album, then buy it used. <br /> <br />
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|I'm not quite sure what Rian Johnson intended to accomplish with this film, but in my opinion the film's greatest accomplishment is highlighting the absurdity of film noir itself. <br /> <br />Many people criticize this film for the absurdity of its setting, its dialog, its characters, and the difficulty one encounters suspending disbelief for the 110 minutes of running time. I think such critics are engaging in a subtle hypocrisy. Film noir always was absurd, and always required suspension of disbelief. By placing those absurdities in an unfamilar historical setting, a clearly fictional and somewhat otherworldly setting of saturated black and white, classic noir may seem cohesive to modern audiences. Thus even the literalists among us can enjoy the classics of film noir. But do not fool yourselves. It is not real, and never was. Nobody ever talked that way, and nobody ever will, except perhaps in a life-imitates-art affectation. <br /> <br />Rian Johnson committed the arguably hostile act of forcing his audience to cope with the fact that a particular set of cinematic customs is at once enjoyable and absurd. By using a modern and realistic setting and shooting in color, he is forcing us to integrate the customs of noir into our own world, and obviously the result is jarring and hard to accept. Mr. Johnson is challenging us to enjoy it despite its absurdity, and indeed, to enjoy it because it is absurd. Many people do not know what to do with this movie because it seems to be playing both satirical and straight at the same time. Is it comedy? Is it noir? It is both at the same time; live with it. But it is also subversive because it is poking fun at the audience and our expectations. That can arouse anger but it should arouse nothing but admiration, because Rian Johnson makes a dramatically effective point through this movie. <br /> <br />The question is, is that enough? It is certainly clever, but is the gimmick sufficient to sustain the film? Almost, I believe, but not quite, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I have a very prosaic complaint, that the dialog is just too hard to understand. The comedy and subversiveness came through fine, but to enjoy it as a detective story, I would have preferred if I didn't have to work quite so hard to understand just what was being said.
B00000099Y|4.0|Although not as good as Lateralus, this album is awesome.  The popular tracks are probably the best ones.  All powerful, with full viens, ready to explode!  There is some filler in this album which is why I didn't give it 5/5.  Definitely a good album to own.  A bit different in style than Undertow and Opiate, which were more stright up edgey rock'n'roll.  Aenima and Lateralus get less technical in the guitar work and get more artsy and moody.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|Jigsaw is a diabolical and ingenious menace.  He is not a serial killer per se, but someone who puts people in situations where they kill themselves and others.  Each victim finds themselves in tense situation where they have to make hard decisions regarding what they will do to go on living.  The main story concerns two individuals who awaken in an abandoned bathroom chained and confused.  In the middle of the room is a dead body in a spreading pool of blood.  There is a gun and a tape player, both out of reach.  But each of the two men have found a cassette with the words Play Me on them. <br /> <br />The to men discover the game they are part of.  If successful, one of them will be dead.  If not, certain loved ones will die instead.  There are rules to be followed.  As the two become more and more desperate, we learn more about them and the evil mind that has put them in this situation.  Although the two are the center of the story, we also get tied up with several other victims and the police investigation.  The action get more and more tense as the time limit is almost reached.  In the end the story delivers with a series of twists at the end that just leave you stunned.  A very good film. <br /> <br />This two-disk edition has some interesting features including the original short film that was expanded into the current film.  I have to say that it was a pleasure to see an intelligent horror film again (they are so rare).  I hope the sequel is just as intelligent.  The acting, action, and settings were top notch.  Several moments made me jump (also a rare thing).  As the credits began to roll and all of the twists sank in fully, all I could think was, \\"Neat!\\"  If you like your horror raw and intelligent then this is one for you.  If you just want a mindless killer like Jason, then this will not fit the bill.  Check it out.
B00000IL31|3.0|A very powerful album for its time, Tool broke new ground with this album.  The first few songs are the best.  The album seems to taper off towards the end and gets a bit repetitive.  Henry Rollins adds a few great words in the song \\"Bottom\\".  If you like Sober, then you will definitely like this album.  It rocks!  If you don't like Tool's \\"Artsy\\" side, then get this album or Opiate.  They are both more traditional sounding rock...but with an edge.  A razor-sharp knife edge.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|One day Chicken little gets hit in the head by a flat blue thing with a cloud on it.  He tries to alert the community to the fact that the sky is falling.  But when he tries to offer proof he can not find the piece of the sky and it is believed he was hit by an acorn.  This shame of this sticks with him for a full year with even a movie being made.  Chicken Little just wants to forget the incident even though he knows he was right.  But then it happens again and he keeps the piece of sky which is able to blend in to its surroundings.  He then enlists the help of his friends Runt, Ugly Duckling, and the Fish Out of Water.  It is Fish who makes a startling discovery and disappears into the sky. <br /> <br />The sky is not falling but pieces of a space ship are.  The friends manage to get on the ship and find Fish, but not before setting in motion horrific events.  The aliens are attacking and they are angry.  Soon a huge armada is sweeping over the town and everyone is in a panic.  But Chicken Little manages to figure out what is really going on.  Now all he has to do is convince his befuddled father what has to be done in order to stop the invasion and save the town.  In the end it all works out and Chicken Little is vindicated and light is shed on his claim of the previous year. <br /> <br />This was pretty good and relatively cute.  It was a nice take on the classic story and manages to pull of the whole alien invasion thing without being too scary.  But amongst the silliness, action and unusual characters there are real issues being dealt with particularly in the relationship between Chicken Little and his father.  A star studded cast supplies the voices to add the final bit of polish to the work.  This was not the movie I expected from the preview but it worked and it worked well.  A good story that is appropriate for just about anyone except the very sensitive (there are a couple of scary-looking alien machines).  Check it out.
B000929AJQ|3.0|Sounds a lot like Pretty Hate Machine.  Lots of good songs here, but most of them are more suited as background music.  Not too many jump out and grab your attention.  Does not even compare to Downward Spiral which is a timeless masterpiece.
B0000648WZ|1.0|The lengths which many are willing to go to provide some sort of intellectual justification of the existence of Starship Troopers never cease to amaze me. \\"Oh, it's satire,\\" they say. \\"It is a subversive send up of fascism, the most brilliant since Dr. Stragelove.\\" Well folks, I'm here to let the cat out of the bag. No it isn't. Starship Troopers is not subversive. Starship Troopers is not satire. Starship Troopers is just stupid. For all its smirking, in-on-its-own-joke faux camp and oh-so-ironic stabs at social commentary, Starship Troopers is nothing more than a schlocky sci-fi shoot 'em up aimed at adolescents (clearly demonstrating that the filmmakers knew all along that their 'subversive' film was a steaming turd) and directed with all the ham-handed prurience which we've all come to know and hate from Paul Verhoeven (whose chief claim to fame is Showgirls, the movie which ensured that no one would ever be curious enough to see an NC-17 film again).<br /><br />That's not to say that 'satire' and 'subversion' aren't attempted, just that they fail miserably (and how could they not with Verhoeven at the helm, not to mention a cast of 'stars' headed by the likes of Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards?). Any satirical effect is lost in the stunning lack of context. So there might be a fascist society some time, for some reason at some point in the future, and it might not be pleasant? How interesting. Now get back to machinegunning four story beetles.<br /><br />The moral of this story? In the future, Marines will take co-ed showers.
B000002UAX|5.0|If I were trapped on a deserted island for eternity and could only have one album with me to pass the time, it would be the White Album. It is the most diverse, interesting and well crafted album ever made. The songs range from rock to country to surfer rock to heavy metal to folk to camp to progressive to the just plain weird. The unparelled songwriting genius of Lennon and McCartney is well on display here as is their obvious differences in style. Harrison also emerges on the White Album and showcases his best song ever \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". Some may point to \\"Sgt Pepper\\" as the Beatles crowning achievement, I point directly and emphatically to the White Album.<br /><br />Best tracks: While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Helter Skelter, Dear Prudence, Back in the USSR, Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey, Happiness is a Warm Gun.
0618680004|2.0|If this review be read at all among many, let me first assure the author that I don't fit into his alternatives of either irrational dogmatist or enlightened Darwinist. Born a Jew, I nevertheless never adhered to Judaism or another religion. Instead I was, beside other intellectual pursuits, drawn toward the question of rationally explored existence of a supreme being.<br /><br />At this time I want merely to focus on the unnoticed fallaciousness of probabilities the author, in solidarity with Darwin, prides himself on as understanding and enlightening others about.<br /><br />He speaks about the probabilities of life and Darwinian adaptation, and the improbability of God.<br /><br />Regarding life, he writes (p.137): \\"a billion billion is a conservative estimate of the number of available planets in the universe. Now, suppose the origin of life...was so improbable as to occur on only one in a billion planets...And yet...life will still have arisen on a billion planets--of which Earth, of course, is one.\\"<br /><br />The argument is astonishingly false. The probability of life on Earth does not depend on the number of planets in the universe, but on the possibilities allowed by the laws of nature within Earth's confines (supposing no aim by a higher power).<br /><br />The chance of blindly picking a white ball from a box of otherwise identical black and white balls does not depend on the number of balls but on their color ratio. If white is one to two, then the odds are 1 in 3, whether there are only 3 balls or 3000. Likewise, the chance of life-supporting Earth depends on its ratio respecting causally possible planets in its domain, seeable as the solar system, regardless of the number of existing planets anywhere, and those possibilities of kind of planet among occurring ones in a solar system are staggeringly multiple, making Earth-like probability virtually nil. Consider in this regard the enormous multiplicity of requirements for a planet with life as we know it.<br /><br />Now to Darwin's centerpiece, adaptation by natural selection. Dawkins vehemently and repeatedly insists (e.g. p.120) that natural selection does not operate by chance. Chance is attributed in Darwinism to initial \\"random mutation\\", whereupon natural selection is to take over, \\"selecting\\" mutations best adapted. Darwin, incidentally, expressed reservations about the word \\"selection\\", because it connotes conscious choice. He of course meant aimless natural forces to affect changed organisms. But the same natural forces cause those changes!<br /><br />That is to say, \\"natural selection\\" is a contrivance intended to replace \\"design\\", but the contrasted \\"random mutation\\" constitutes \\"a distinction without a difference\\". The theory indeed says as a whole no more than that successive effects of the natural forces on organisms somehow make them adapt--a height of improbability Darwin himself acknowledged (p.125 of the reviewed book): \\"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the author in his persistent argument that God is improbable contends (p.109) that \\"any God capable of designing anything would have to be complex enough to demand the same kind of explanation\\" and accordingly \\"presents an infinite regress\\", which argument \\"demonstrates that God...is very very improbable indeed.\\"<br /><br />In my last review I already explained why an explanation of an explanation, and so forth, is not required for a finding. If we succeed in explaining a phenomenon, here by its cause, the explanation stands without having to explain the cause of the cause, and so on. God's improbability is said, in addition, to somehow follow from his complexity, but there is no statistical ratio, as above, from which a degree of probability follows. God needn't conform to such as laws of nature, which he presumably created but may not be bound by. His probability can, therefore, not be measured.<br /><br />There isn't enough room for responses I may have to the author's many other, often outrageous and irrelevant, statements, and I have written more thoroughly on the principal subject--and on other matters concerning knowledge--in my book and elsewhere. I marked Dawkins' book for a second star because of his, in my eyes unfortunate, success in swaying his audience to his point of view.esumably created but may not be bound by.

0307346609|2.0|I wanted to enjoy this book, I really did. I purchased it along with Cormac Mccarthy's \\"The Road\\" (an infinitely superior novel.) - it was offered as a package deal.  <br /> <br />My main complaint regarding the novel - the interviewees all speak with the same voice, that is to say, the Cuban character sounds like the American character sounds like the Japanese character sounds like the Australian character sounds like.... <br /> <br />There is very little, if any, use of the individual speakers native tongue, no phrasing, no regional dialect, no idiomatic flavor or any variation to the characters \\"voices.\\" They all \\"sound\\" the same.  <br /> <br />I assume that all the interviewees speak English as a first or second language (the interviewer never mentions the services of an interpreter.) - yet, the voice of an Indian character is indecipherable from that of an American.  <br /> <br />To be fair, I should mention that I am not particularly fond of the horror genre, my tastes run more along the lines of - David Foster Wallace, Thomas Pynchon, Cormac Mccarthy, Jonathan Lethem, Richard Powers, Don DeLillo, post and post post-modern fiction.  <br /> <br />I also did not find the book to be creepy or scary in any way. I would highly recommend Mccarthy's, \\"The Road\\" if you are interested in apocalyptic fiction. The writing is stunning, lyrical and incredibly bleak and much more horrifying than anything to be found within the pages of \\"World War Z\\"  <br /> <br />The Road is as brilliant and important as it is bleak and depressing. It should be required reading for anyone concerned with our increasingly periled existence. Mccarthy has done such an amazing job of envisioning such a nightmare that at times I felt compelled to put the book down, pick up my beautiful little three month old, Lily, and step outside to reinstill in my mind a sense of life and color. It is that bleak and depressing at times, but underneath all the detritus lies an oddly uplifting parable. At it's core is a heartbreaking love story between parent and child - and who cannot relate to that? <br />
B000002UA2|4.0|A near perfect lp. Every bit as diverse as the oft-praised Meddle, but without an extended piece, \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" is one of those great neglected lps that shows what a group was capable of, and hints at the directions they might've chosen to go and did not.<br /><br />Though the instrumentals are successfully filmic, the vocal numbers are more memorable. It's these that find the group playing outside the lines. Wright and Waters in particular really stand out as highly capable and eclectic musicians, excelling in a variety of styles.<br /><br />\\"the gold it's in the....\\" is a great power pop blow-out. It's almost unidentifiable as Pink Floyd, which, to me, is a fine indication of talent,playing and writing outside your main bag. It's a bit like Todd Rundgren meets Big Star meets, um, anyone from glam rock. Very nice. Nick Mason's marvelous Spinal Tap-style tom fills are sweet.<br /><br />\\"wot's...uh the deal\\" is a gorgeous pop number. Very Beatley what with the acoustic guitar arpeggios and a tune somewhere between Harrison and McCartney. Guitars are very George Harrison in fact. Even Gilmour's signature slide electric manages to sound like the Beatles. Tasty piano by the always underrated Rick Wright, who really shines through the whole lp.<br /><br />\\"Childhood's End\\" is the most typical of what would follow for the Floyd: doomier numbers in a middle tempo rock vein.<br /><br />\\"Free Four\\": some reviewers have expressed displeasure at this number. I find it delightful black humour. The themes of death and futility dominate all of Waters' work from Dark Side on out in a too heavy way for this reviewer to take. Where's the fun?  But here we have hilarious synth stings, up front hand claps, a faux-Cockney count-in, and boisterously strummed acoustic guitars. Much fun to hear. Wish there was more like it.<br /><br />\\"Stay\\": I can't believe this song wasn't an international #1 hit single. It is one of the best pop ballads of the decade. The lyrics perfectly illustrate the \\"one night stand\\" zeitgeist of the 70's. Fabulous tune and arrangement.  Can't say enough positive about it.<br /><br />To fully experience this great music be sure to get yourself the edition with \\"Digital Re-masters 1995\\" in fine print on the back cover (bar code: 7777-46385-2). Older editions are still floating around. I bought and returned one from the 80's. Ick. This 1995 remaster is certainly superlative.rate the \\"one night stand\\" zeitgeist of the 70's.

B000DN6ZGC|5.0|I first saw Corrine Bailey Rae on on SNL this past Saturday night.  She is beautiful, poised, graceful, and talented.  I listened to her CD this morning on the way to work, and I am impressed!  While not a vocal acrobat or powerhouse, she has impeccable phrasing.  She not only sings these songs, she owns them.  My commute was definitely enjoyable this morning. <br /> <br />I have a lot of difficulty with other reviewers' insistence to compare her to Nelly Furtado.  They may sing in approximately the same range, but their styles are totally different. <br /> <br />Ms. Rae, I will see you at the Grammies!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Having grown up with hard rock and merging in to jazz with age,  I'm not sure what prompted me to buy the album.  I hadn't heard it or about it.  Bob Dylan was just some wierd musician to me - This one album has changed all that; I'm a new Bob Dylan fan -  Modern Times is pure musical magic.  It is at the same time haunting, ironic, true, brilliant...  (yes I'm beginning to purchase older stuff now..  I've a lot of catch-up work to do!)  One review labled the music \\"pedadantic\\" - likely not a musicians point of view.  No it's not oversaturated with gizmo sound and yes it lacks the immediately catchy Brittany Spears pop sound.  Bob Dylan is the wrong place to look for that anyway.  Relax, reminisce, day-dream - older is sometimes better!
B000GCFO08|4.0|This is a pretty good movie, could of been better.  If your like me and are a fan of movies based on Video Games then this is a must have.
0895260131|5.0|I like the early chapters where the author goes through common arguments like 'Even in the Old Testament Moses killed off tribes... so how is this different than Islam?'  This and many other common arguments are answered and dealt with directly, not with clever phrases, but well thought and very rational answers.  A MUST READ! Changes the way you see the news on the main-stream media. Look at the reviews below that rate this less than three stars. They don't even comment on the content and references sited. I was very impressed with how meticulously the author referenced assertions and claims that would understandably upset those that follow Muhammad. No matter what side of the fence you are on before reading this book or listening to the CD version, truth is truth, and this author can't change truth. Do the research and be informed. A fantastic read and listen! AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ FOR THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT THE WESTERN WORLD. Semper Fi.
0440203856|3.0|It's a good read, but very predictable especially if you've read a couple of danielle steel's books before.  The Russian dynasty storyline was pretty interesting though. It actually inspired me to do some research on the Romanovs, which I knew little about initially.  Based in both WWI and WWII, which is a time period I like to read about.  Typical riches-to-rags-to-riches story.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|The album provides a very enjoyable experience. We know Bob Dylan is a jack of all trades and a master of nearly everything in the musical genre. From protest songs to love songs and then to break up songs. From acoustic, to electric, to gospel, and now onto 'modern times'. This is a feel good album through and through (...because it feels good to know that Bob still has it after all these years). The stand out tracks in my opinion are \\"Spirit in the Water\\", \\"Working Man's Blues #2\\", \\"Beyond the Horizon\\", and \\"Nettie Moore\\". If you like good music, then you'll enjoy this album for a very very long time.
B0000073YB|4.0|I had a hard time classifying this album. Is it early techno/indutrail? Goth? New Wave? Pop? I stuck with pop simply because everyone knows Tainted Love as a pop song, but this album really shows how talented and underrated Soft Cell were. This album was miles ahead of its time, and despite being over 20 years old, wouldn't seem out of place in a any modern club. If all you know from them is Tainted Love, do yourself a favor and buy this album now
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Mainly, the movie follows the aftermath of the very successful video game, Final Fantasy 7.  If you haven't played the game, the movie will probably not make as much sense.   <br />   After the destruction of Jenova, there are still followers of Sephiroth.   They make attempts to resurrect this classical villain.  Cloud and his friends again step in to save the world.    <br />   There is some good voice acting, and the action sequences are amazing!  There is a scene while Cloud is fighting on a motorcycle with his big sword, fighting two guys at once.  It is really something.   <br />   If you liked the video game and enjoy action sequences, then I would recommend this to you.  If you have not played the game and do not like action sequences, then you might not like it.  Hope you find this helpful.
B0007PAMR4|2.0|Ug. I really dislike this movie. Dune is one of my favorite books, and this movie totally ruined it. It is boring, confusing, unfaithful to the book, and just plain badly done. If you want to see the real Dune, watch the amazing miniseries done by sci-fi channel and it's sequel, Children of Dune. Both are much better done and much more faithful to the source material.
0618680004|5.0|For those of us certain there is no spook in the sky, or for those willing to entertain the idea, this is a very readable and useful book setting out almost all the important points against the existence of some god, and in particular the pernicious nature and effects of organized religion.  However, it is not going to sway or convince any godfreak, as evidenced by some of the reviews here.  For us, the rational, it gives quotations, logical arguments, and information useful in countering the prevailing irrationality of the godfreaks of all religions.  Despite the usefulness of this this book, it will, alas, not mark the beginning of the end of religion, simply because the vast majority of people want to believe, despite the lack of any evidence of a god(s).  Sturgeon's Law, that 95% of everything is crap, applies to people, too; these are the godfreaks.  For the rational among us, read and enjoy!
B0000640VO|4.0|Amélie Poulain is a young woman who glides through the streets of Paris as quietly as a mouse. With wide eyes and a tiny grin, she sees the world in a magical light, discovering minor miracles every day. Having seen her share tragedies and fantasies, Amélie Poulain is not like other girls. Bursting with imagination, she enjoys simple pleasures until she discovers that her goal in life is to help others. Amélie dedicates her life to making people happy, and along the way, she stumbles upon her own happiness... residing in the man named Nino Quicampoix. <br /> <br />      Along her journey to happiness, she orchestrates events to make people happy. A man by the name of Lucien works as an assistant for the grocer, Collignon. Lucien is degraded and humiliated by his boss everyday. Amélie decides to take action. As she walks down the stairs of her apartment building one day, she sees a set of keys hanging on a door. The keys belonged to Collignon. Amélie decides to return the keys to Collignon but witnesses a scene where Collignon humiliates Lucien in front of a bunch of customers. Amélie, disgusted, goes to a locksmith to make a copy of the key to Collignon's front door. She returns to the apartment building and puts the keys back into the key hole. As she leaves, you can see the copy she made in her pocket. Now, it's time for revenge. While Collignon works at the grocery store, Amélie sneaks into his apartment with the copy key she made. Switching things around the house, Amélie delivers a hilarious comeuppance. From replacing door handles to switching out shoes to switching out light bulbs, she practically drives Collignon insane. Now guess who's in charge. That's right. Lucien gives the orders now. Amélie also meets a woman by the name of Madeleine Wallace, the concierge. Her husband had left her to run off with another woman taking with him almost all her money. Mrs. Wallace is hurt till this very day, remembering her husband's betrayal as his portrait is on her wall. Amélie tries to think up a way to help her, but can't. Until...she sees a letter from Mrs. Wallace's husband. She opens the letter and reads exactly what she doesn't want Mrs. Wallace to see. With a great idea in mind, Amélie cuts out all the words of the letter. She pastes the words on top of a piece of paper, photocopies it, dips it in tea, and puts it up to dry. And when she was done, the letter looked as if it was written a long time ago. When Mrs. Wallace received the letter, she was thrilled and very happy. She had read the letter that said that her husband regretted the fact that he had left her and he still loved her. Amélie had made another person happy. What about her own happiness? <br /> <br />      Amélie meets Nino Quicampoix, an intriguing young man who collects the photos of anonymous individuals. One day, his album of photos ends up in her hands. She decides to return it and sets up a scenario for him to find the album. Nino, interested in this mystery woman, decides to find out who she is. As she watches Nino from afar, she gradually falls in love with him. During this time, they showed many surrealistic images that fascinated me. One scene I enjoyed watching that was when Nino was sleeping in his room. Nino woke up to hearing the voices of the passport photos clipped to his lamp. The man in the photos were talking to him and giving him conflicting advice as to how he should approach Amélie. That could not really happen in real life, but I found it amusing to have photos talk to you and give you advice. Another scene that intrigued me was the scene where Amélie's suicidal goldfish was freaking out her mother. It's true that fish sometimes try to suicide, but not like how Amélie's goldfish attempted at suicide. The goldfish was Amélie's only friend, but her mother couldn't take it anymore. And so, the goldfish was thrown into the river. I felt that this scene was symbolic in a way that Amélie was left with no friends and no onewho could understand her. <br /> <br />      Amélie is a movie that defies all boundaries of imagination and lets the viewer experience things that could never happen in the real world. Amélie awakens the child-like part of us as we realize what we can do with our lives to make it more fun and enjoyable. This film also makes us think about how we can help others like how such a selfless, lonely girl like Amélie can. I feel that this movie has taught me how to become a better person and to not be so selfless as to neglect myself either. Amélie is a wonderful movie that lets its viewers see the little things that we normally miss or take granted for. <br />

B000001DVD|4.0|High 'n' Dry makes up in raw power for what it lacks in production.  Pyromania would take Def Leppard's production to a new level, but with that they lost the edge.  The production of High 'n' Dry isn't *bad* by any stretch of the imagination, but the difference between this and Pyromania is clear.  This album was the last where it was the music that mattered and not how slick it sounded. <br /> <br />I've never been a huge Def Leppard fan, but being a teenager during their hey-day, how could one not be familiar with the likes of \\"Photograph\\" and the other multi-platinum hits from Pyromania?  With that said, though, the other noticeable difference between this album and the next is that there really are no bad songs on this album.  It's just plain high-intensity rock 'n' roll from start to finish. <br /> <br />If \\"Bringing On The Heartbreak\\" single-handedly ushered in the rock-ballad genre, I suppose that's not the worst legacy to have.  I have to admit that I like that song, even if I do despise a lot of what came after. <br /> <br />This is without a doubt the high-point of Def Leppard's creative output.  Although Pyromania is the Def Leppard everybody remembers, High 'n' Dry is what made them.  If you're a fan, you owe it to yourself to add this to your collection.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|I gave this movie one star because I thought the special effects were good.  I also think that Kelsey Grammer did a wonderful job in his portrayal of Hank McCoy/Beast/.  If it were not for these two factors I think giving this film one star would be difficult.  This is a movie that had potential, but ended up being a second or third rate action film.  If you love special effect and violence then this movie is for you, otherwise look elsewhere. <br /> <br />Now some people may think I am harsh, so here are some of my reasons for hating this movie.  First they kill off many main characters for no real reason.  Cyclopes is killed of early for no reason, other than to show that Jean Grey is now and evil psycho.  This was a major character in the first two movies, and after his death it is like he never even existed. <br /> <br />Then they kill off Professor X.  I am still trying to figure that one out.  One reviewer has said that it was to give Halle Berry a bigger role or she would not have done the movie.  Now I don't know if this is true but it is the only thing that makes sense.  My response is that if she wasn't happy let her go.  It is not a case where she did the role so well that you couldn't get someone to replace her.  I do not know why you would kill off the character of a really good actor like Patrick Stewart in favor of an overrated actress that thinks she is better than she is.  Her character had no real depth.  The pink and purplr hair didn't do the character any favors either <br /> <br />Another character they killed off was Mystique.  Now I thought that character was really interesting, and she was someone in the first two films I wanted to know more about.  Then they just get rid of her quick in this one. <br /> <br />As I mentioned earler, they turn Jean in to a murdering psycho.  When we saw her die in X2, I was hoping they would find a way to bring her back.  Now after seeing this film I wish they would have let her stay dead.  Her only purpose inthe film was to murder people, and not say much.  By the time she dies at the end I don't really care.  This was a waste of a good character. <br /> <br />I also think they could have done more with the relationship between angel and his father.  I would have like to seen how saving his father helped change their relationship. <br /> <br />Lastly, this movie was way too predictable. I knew that when Professor X talked about Storm taking over someday that he was going to be killed.  I knew that Magneto would want to rule the world as he has in other films.  I knew that Iceman and Pyro were going to go one on one at the end after their exchange in the crowd of demonstrators.  I knew that when Storm asked Wolverine if he could do what needed to be done, that he would be the one to kill Jean in the end. <br /> <br />I could keep going, but I think I have got my point across.  This was just simply an awful movie.  I recommend that people rent it before they buy it, or you may discover that you wasted good money.
B00005JNS0|3.0|Pixar has quite a high bar to maintain and they falter a little on this one.  Based on my 12 year old neice's suggestion, she and I watched this film.  Pixar's usually pretty good right?  Both of us at one point looked at each other about half way through to figure out what time it was.  The film has great messages and wonderful animation but the execution is really flat and boring.  Pixar is noteable for being exceptional, something that's hard to do with animated films that will be appealing to both kids and adults.  It's enjoyable for the most part but this clearly is the first of the Pixar films to fall noticeably short.

B000A59PMO|2.0|I had thought that \\"Veronica Mars\\" (VM) might be a good replacement for \\"Alias\\" in our family DVD viewing. My two children, ages 9 & 11, have been really into Alias (we're currently in season 2), but occasionally their mother and I worry about the level of violence. I was impressed by the generally high ratings that Amazon reviewers have given VM, and all the positive remarks here about how intelligent the show is. So I bought the first season of VM, and this evening we started watching... <br /> <br />After five minutes, I told my children, \\"sorry, but this is crap\\". They wanted to watch a bit more, so we ended up watching about 20 mins total. The children agreed with me then that we should quit VM, and instead watch another episode of Alias. Later, I told them I was going to sell the VM season ASAP. No complaints. <br /> <br />My critique of VM:  <br /> <br />The show's writing is indeed sophisticated, as so many reviewers here have celebrated. But what VM's writers achieved, at least to me, is a super-phony effect: a 16-year old girl channeling  1940's era big-screen detectives. The voice-over narration by the teen detective doesn't sound real, and is also sexually edgy in a way that I found completely fake and also inappropriate for my pre-teens (for example, Veronica's deadpan comment during a stakeout about needing to get the \\"money shot\\" on film). <br /> <br />In those first 20 minutes that we watched, the story cut very quickly from one scene to the next. Veronica narrated the action in great detail, with the same toughness of character that viewers of old detective movies will instantly recognize. It was almost like listening to a story being read. To quote a phrase though, I didn't buy it. The scenes we saw had no depth or originality, and there wasn't anything special about any of the acting, either. <br /> <br />In short, I got the vibe that VM is junk TV, and wouldn't recommend it for any age.

B0006399FS|3.0|This album is definitely not U2 at their best or most animated. Rather, it's almost like U2 neutered ... at least somewhat. What made matters worse was that this album was initially hyped to be a 'rock album'. So where is the rock? <br /> <br />To be sure, Vertico and All Because of You are rock songs, and especially the latter is a fun, rocking romp that demands repeated listens. <br /> <br />But just look at the tracklisting. Vertigo is followed by two slow ballads ... Miracle Drug, a song that slowly crescendos and acts as a slower counterpart to songs like \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", \\"Sometimes...\\", a song with beautiful lyrics but that musically doesn't really go anywhere. \\"Love and Peace\\" takes forever to get started, and is a fun enough song, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br />Indeed, it isn't until you get to \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" until you reach a song where u2 is performing near their peak. This song is one of the first highlights off the disc, followed by an equally good \\"All Because of You\\". \\"A Man and A Woman\\" follows that with a nice acoustic touch, and some nice bass work by Adam. Even \\"Crumbs\\" is a decent song, although musically a bit of a rehash of what u2 has done in the past. <br /> <br />\\"One Step Closer\\" is a snoozer, and the last two songs are decent, again nothing spectacular though. <br /> <br />This album would be far better had it lived up to the hype that it would be a rock album. There are so many midtempo/slow songs on this disc that it is almost more adult contemporary than rock. <br /> <br />Now I get word that another best of cd is the works. I think u2 is running out of creativity, I hate to say it but it seems to be true.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Although I've enjoyed all of John Mayer's albums, Continuum is nothing short of phenomenal.  I can't help replaying it over and over.  Try it while driving lonely backroads and you will be lost in blissful introspection.  There is just so much to experience with this album, not only its incredible soulful sound and John's captivating smoky voice, but the poetic lyrics he has created are amazing fodder for any creative soul.  <br /> <br />There is not one song on this album that I don't adore.  \\"The Heart of Life\\", I am addicted to.  \\"Stop This Train\\" makes me cry every time (and I'm not overly emotional!) \\"Gravity\\" is just pivotal to the album...I can understand why he says it's so important.  \\"In Repair\\" has a mesmerizing rhythm that beats like a heart when cranked up a few octaves.  And, in short, they each bring something unique.   <br /> <br />You can tell that Continuum is full of heart, soul, and unique takes on life.  A compendium of songs this good does not come along that often.  I think, as an artist John's evolution is incredible and inspirational.  Thanks for such real music. <br /> <br />
B0007PALZ2|5.0|The inspiration came from the guy that assaulted CBS anchor Dan Rather and was screaming what's the frequency Kenneth.  Also the title of an R.E.M song about the same thing.  The person though they were from a different dimension and was admitted to psychatric facility after getting arrested for beating up Dan Rather.  He though DR was a person from the dimesnion he though he came from and nneded to know the frequency so he could jam the message constantly being replayed in his head.  He was in jail and missed his portal to go back to his dimension.  In the 90's the guy killed an NBC technician while trying to get the frequency from him to stop the message in his head.  He thought the message was a deterrant to keep him from not coming back to his home dimesnion with the info he was required to get from our dimension.  He is now spending the rest of his life in prison.  Truth is always stranger than fiction.  So the idea of Cole possibly being sane or insane is cetainly one of the main themes because it is loosley based off of a real person who beleives basically the same thing accept different dimension instead of differnt date in time. By the way the movie is incredible very twisted visually and plot wise.
0451167716|5.0|It was also the last great American novel written.There has been so many wasters published ,since 1969.This sweet book got people reading again,and it wetted the public's appetite for more good literature.This could have been a story of anyone's family.Did you know that Saddam Hussein's favorite movie was the \\"Godfather\\"? Everyone could relate to this novel,and the following films.-When Robert Duvall backed-out of \\"Godfather3\\",many wondered ,\\"Whatsamatter wid-ya???\\".After seeing part 3,Duvall probably felt the script was 'weak and DOA'.The Paramount Studio may have been trying to saddle up a 'cash-cow',that turned out to be a dead-horse.The young Coppella knew it was a great story and a great stepping-stone for him,to do his classic Horror films.(Why haven't Stephan King and Francis Ford Coppella collaborated on some films?It would be Mega-Magick !) Coppella is one of the best film-makers around,yet he always had the contend with a fickle public.Many parts,of the novel, were cut-out and never resolved.(As was Lucy Mancini's extra-slack.)I wish today's literary novels had the same high level of standards,as Puzo's original \\"Godfather\\" classic.The 'DaVinci Code' is based on faulty historical information and questionable sources.Whether you read ,'Il Padrino' or 'Der Pate',the lingua franca of humanity,connects all readers to Mario Puzo's fabulous saga.

1932907009|4.0|This is a very good book on the craft of writing scripts that get sold, and if that is your aim (and what screenwriter doesn't want to sell a script?) this is an important book to read.  Blake Snyder knows the territory.  He makes a very good living selling scripts and has created a user-friendly guide to the process that has worked for him.  I have read most of the other \\"classics\\" in the field, and this is very likely the best if what you want is both a clarification of the mindset of those who buy screenplays and a set of reliable strategies for appealing to them.  Even if you never plan to write a screenplay, I would recommend this for someone who is interested in how Hollywood works.<br /><br />While the book is very well written -- Mr. Snyder knows how to make his point both clearly and cleverly -- I had an uneasy feeling while I was reading it.  He illustrates his points with some very exceptional (and some not so stellar but reasonably successful) films, and I believe he convincingly shows that some of the best Hollywood films are in line with the strategies he suggests.  At the same time, nothing he writes begins to suggest what the difference is between the very best films and the generic and forgettable films that \\"work\\" but have nothing special to recommend them (I guess that is what I mean by describing them here as the product of \\"hacks\\").  The criterion he continually points to is just that the films he admires were in fact sold and recuperated their investment.  That is no small accomplishment, and Blake is to be congratulated for having written two films (and some smaller projects, including so-far unproduced films) that appear to fit this bill -- and especially for making clear that there are some more or less reliable guidelines to getting there.  Still, as everyone knows (and this is what lies behind the usual critiques of Hollywood type films) there are a lot of films that do get made and even make money that will nevertheless be forgotten very quickly, and will never win awards or the admiration of critics.  This book is not aimed to do anything more than help you in creating the latter.  Blake Snyder's own films, while certainly evidence of craft and skill, are obvious examples: I can't believe that \\"Stop or My Momma Will Shoot!\\" or \\"Blank Check\\" will ever be on anyone's top 100 films list, or will ever stand out as films that were \\"worth\\" making apart from the fact that they earned back their investments.<br /><br />A lot of reviews are written here by people who have attended Mr. Snyder's seminars, and who obviously like him.  He does seem like a charismatic (even if a bit self-important) man from the way he writes, and you certainly can learn a lot from his book.  After reading this book, though, I would strongly recommend honing the strategies he outlines by watching the very best Hollywood films in the genres you choose to write in, films that are both \\"successful\\" and admired.  What you will find is that while they usually do fit the strategies he encourages, there is usually much in them that a studio executive would not likely have embraced willingly and yet somehow is the special thing that makes the film stand out.  In addition, it would be well worth your while watching the very best films made outside the Hollywood tradition (films from the Criterion collection of dvds would not be a bad place to start), many of which deliberately eschew the kinds of strategies Snyder suggests and yet have stood the test of time and stand as enduring examples of the power of the cinema (-- Snyder acknowledges that there are critically acclaimed films that don't fit the mold -- he uses Memento as his example -- but thinks he clinches the point about the value of his methods when he reminds us that these films rarely make as much money as more mainstream fare; he misses the point that while Memento was no cash cow, it will continue to be watched twenty years from now, and it did recuperate its costs and did fairly well for an indie; and introduced the world to a talented director who has since gone on to create extremely successful commercial films that are much less generic than most mainstream Hollywood fare).  While Blake Snyder's book may well be the last book on screenwriting that you really need (since what all of us aspiring writiers really need is just to write and rewrite and get rejected and reflect on what went wrong and get advice from writers we admire and keep writing), still the guidelines he offers are only a starting point for understanding and creating unforgettable films that are worth making and that the world really needs.an indie; and introduced the world to a talented director who has since gone on to create extremely successful commercial films that are much less generic than most mainstream Hollywood fare).

B000GY729M|4.0|it is far better than any music out there, this band set a very high standard w/ \\"hot fuss\\", and now this album although not as great, it is very solid, the first 3 songs, excluding enterlude are classics especially \\"bling\\", this is the killers at their best, the song is simply genius, the rest of the album is very good and it is a classic, this band is as original as they come
B00009RAJJ|5.0|I must admit a few things:  1. I bought my first Fleetwood Mac album this week and I'm 32 years old.  2. See #1.  I bought \\"Say You Will\\", \\"Fleetwood Mac\\", \\"Rumours\\" and \\"Tusk\\" within a two-day period because the new Lindsey Buckingham solo record picqued my interest in Fleetwood Mac's older stuff.   <br /> <br />Tusk is a landmark album, to say the least.  From the unexpected, laid-back \\"Over and Over\\" to the absolutely brilliant and ahead-of-its-time \\"Tusk\\", this album is one delicious musical confection after another.  All three songwriters are in top form here and although Buckingham's offerings sometime seem like deliberate attempts to buck what people expected from him at the time, most of his efforts are successful.  The remaster is absolutely gorgeous and with my Bose headphones, this stuff just sounds amazing.  It sounds so amazing, in fact, that I'm having trouble putting the thing down!  Every sound seems perfect and the songs themselves just sparkle with creativity, energy and variety.  This is one of those albums that defies a label and simply exists in its own bubble of artistic perfection.  I certainly don't know what it would have been like to listen to this in 1979 right after Rumours, but I can tell you that it is one of the most enjoyable musical experiences I've had in a long time.   <br /> <br />Some of my personal favorite tracks are:  \\"Over and Over\\", \\"Think About Me\\", \\"Tusk\\", \\"Brown Eyes\\", \\"Storms\\", \\"What Makes You Think You're the One\\", and \\"That's Enough For Me\\".  If you love music, treat yourself to the most creative, exciting, groundbreaking album Fleetwood Mac will ever make.   <br /> <br />I give this album five stars because I honestly don't think it could be any better.  It's not \\"Rumours\\" because it wasn't supposed to be, but it is proof of the elasticity of one of the most commercially successful bands ever and has solidified their place in rock history as creative forces to be reckoned with.
B000051VWW|5.0|This is my favorite album period. I have to admit that I am not too high up on Sade's first albums, But this one takes it. I think everybody that listens to the crap that is coming out now, needs to get a reality check and listen to the real. Alicia Keys......Yeah whatever.She can't hold a match compared to Sade. I just wish another album would come out.  There is nothing lost in this album. And jeez, can Sade be any finer. The most gorgeous woman on the planet, with the best voice.
B00003CXCT|5.0|my favorite movie is starwars trilogy. it is about the dark side and the good side.  It takes place in the future.  It is set in space.  I liked it because it has action and love. It is also funny and is cool.  All people would like the movie because it is about science and space. I give it a thumbs up.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Wow!  I bought this CD after reading Tommy Lee's bio and he mentions how this CD made him want to curl up in a fetal position he was so relaxed.   Whether you are in your car driving or in a bubble bath with lit candles,  this CD does it.

B00003CXC7|2.0|Well, I hate to say that I was not impressed, but I cannot lie so here it goes: <br /> <br />\\"I was not impressed.\\" <br /> <br />The question to ask would be why, and I guess the answer to that question is that I expected much more.  I have been a long standing fan of Hitchcock, not because I shiver at the sight of his films but because as a storyteller he is one of the most brilliant men who ever directed a film.  The problem with `Rear Window' to me is that you spend almost two hours just waiting for something to happen, and the suspense your promised doesn't really rear it's head. <br /> <br />The film follows L.B. Jeffries (Stewart), a photographer who is still recovering from an accident where his leg was broken.  He's stuck in his home until his cast is removed and he has nothing to do with his time but spy on his neighbors.  In the process of doing so he thinks he uncovers a murder take place (or at least he thinks he uncovers a murder, for he never really sees the murder happen).  He tries of course to convince those around him, including his girlfriend Lisa (Kelly) and his nurse (Ritter), and he succeeds on those accounts, but when it comes to getting his friend Lt. Thomas Doyle (Corey) he fails to do so. <br /> <br />Because of that Jeffries and his two accomplices decide to take matters into their own hands by sneaking into Lars Thorwald's (Burr) apartment (he's the man they assumed killed his wife) and by digging up the garden where they assumed he buried her.  I guess to me that main problem is that for the majority of this film nothing is happening.  We, the viewer, are just watching what Jeffries watches, which is pretty much nothing.  The story is a fine story it's just a bit boring.  Like I said, being such a long standing fan of Hitchcock I expected so much more from this film since it is so well regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest. <br /> <br />I disagree.
0393061310|5.0|Diamond presents a look at the evolution of various Cultures throughout the World and how geography has played an important part in their developement.  The reason that Eurasia and North Africa evolved more highly developed (technologically anyway) cultures was that there was a wider variety of wild plant and animal species that could be tamed by the humans living in those areas following the Ice Age than there was available to humans in other parts of the world.  This enabled people in these areas to develope farming societies (which required more specializations than hunter gatherer societies) more quickly than in other parts of the globe. <br /> <br />The close proximity of animals in this farming societies passed on germs from animal hosts to humans and evolved human resistance to pathogens such as smallpox to survivors of the diseases and their offspring.  Those areas such as the Americas without large domesticated animals to catch diseases from were decimated by Old World diseases when they were introduced by European Explorers. <br /> <br />The premise of the book could have degenerated into White Supremacist or Multi-Cultural nonsense and the fact that it doesn't says a lot about the writing skills of the author.  One fact that he doesn't address is how the freedom of expression is a key factor in the development of societies.  When that Freedom disappears or is suppressed as in the case of 15 C China or 18 C Holland society tends to stagnant and decline. <br /> <br />I would reccomend the book for those interested in History, Anthropology, or Sociology.
B0000640VO|4.0|Audrey Tautou makes this film more than what it would be without her.  That's not to say that the plot is mediocre but without her the film itself wouldn't have stood out.  As Amelie Audrey is wonderfully delightful, a true free spirit and a classic comedic talent.  When Amelie finds a hidden tin in her apartment that belonged to a previous tenant she becomes determined to return it and once she has she decides to help others around her, from her father who's always wanted to vacation but never has because of Amelie's supposed heart condition as a child, to her workmate who needs a man.  She tries helping an old man in her apartment as well as a tyrant grocer's assistant.  But in the end she ends up helping herself for once and everything ends up happy.  It's a very sweet story that's elevated by a brilliant performance by Audrey.

0307346609|5.0|I love zombie movies - specifically, the Old Testament of zombie movies, the original Romero trilogy. Zach Snyder's Dawn remake was pretty awesome too, 28 Days Later and Shaun of the Dead were worthy additions to the canon, not to mention the ongoing excellence of Robert Kirkman's Walking Dead graphic novel series.  <br /> <br />Now we can add Max Brooks (son of Mel Brooks) to the pantheon of great zombie contributors. Actually, Brooks already had the credit for penning the Zombie Survival Guide a few years back, which instructs you where to go, what to do and how to deal with the undead in the event of a zombie plague. In World War Z, Brooks takes the post-Romero procedures he outlined there and fleshes them out into a full history book, written sometime in the future in the aftermath of a full zombie apocalypse. And it is a stunning piece of work.  <br /> <br />This isn't just a piece of pulp fiction, splatter or horror - it's part history book, part sociological study, part political science piece, and part military history geekfest, all wrapped up in the kind of post-civilization numbness that makes the aforementioned works so compelling, so terrifying and ultimately, so human.  <br /> <br />Written from the perspective of a world-roving journalist, we hear about the initial outbreak in China and the failure of the world's political bodies to prevent its spread. Then it blooms into a full worldwide epidemic, first as rumors and then as your neighbors eating each other in the streets. After the book's Great Panic - featuring epic set pieces that are just mind-boggling in their chaos - we read how individuals around the world survived the end of the world, whether as part of military groups, teeming crowds of refugees, or even on their own.  <br /> <br />I could go on and on about how fascinating this book was, how many jaw-dropping moments and ancedotes and stories he's crafted, how may brilliant and intriguing details, buzzwords and unique cultural ripple effects Brooks has created and worked in, but I won't. All I'll say is that here, he's made the single biggest contribution to zombie fantasy (even more enduring than ever, the genre that simply won't die) since Romero created this world with the original Night of the Living Dead.
B000F8O4E0|5.0|Great use of orchstration.. early days of ELO.. at the time they were very edgy - innovative...using backward masking..amazing arrangments <br />The two hits at the time weree Evil Woman and Strange Magic.. I like the other songs on the album too  but One great song that many NON ELO Fans probably never heard but would like is a son called ONE SUMMER DREAM. It was a simple song but amazingly beautiful!!!! <br />MUST HAVE FOR YOUR COLLECTION
0393061434|5.0|This is an excellent book about a truly interesting and innovative man.   It provides real insight into his work, his style and his personality.   I had the pleasure of seeing Steve on his speaking tour and I was really impressed by how the book captures his style, tone and spirit.   Steve has a real childlike quality to him which shows through alternatively as playfulness, humor, goofiness and innocence.  He also has a long history with promoting education and teaching. <br /> <br />Some of the earlier reviews say this shows up as \\"childish\\" writing.   Quite the contrary, it is this quality that has long given him his strength.   His ability to take a challenge others thought impossibly complex and turn it into a simple, elegant reality.  At this he was unparalleled. <br /> <br />Some may be upset that he is so plainspoken, but I'm glad the co-author did not try to change Steve's voice.  To do so would have done the man a strong disservice, and instead we are left with a fascinating portrait and a compelling read.
B000002UAR|5.0|Even more than Pepper, I think this was the album that changed pop music forever. I was in the UK and a teen at the time, and I have to admit it took several listenings and a healthy dose of illegal srimulants to figure it out. Today the music is still revolutionary and I no longer need the stimulants (sniff) but it ranks as one of the best 5 albums of all time
B000EHRVP6|5.0|This is absolutely one of the scariest horror films I've ever seen, simply because the premise is SO plausible.  It could happen to anyone on their next trip away from home, and the eerie reality (particularly for any who has been to Europe) will keep you from blinking through the entire film.<br /><br />Premise:  Young adults backpacking through Europe meet a fellow traveler who says, \\"Hey, you gotta try Upper Slobovia!  Best women on the planet and everything's cheap - blah, blah\\".  So, parting from their benefactor, off they go.  Tra-la-la!  Think of this as a far darker, \\"The Island\\" (Leo DiCaprio), only this boasts 100,000 watts of \\"shock-you-in-your-seat\\" power.  My funmeter was in the red during the entire film.  What else - it's Quinton Tarantino approved.<br /><br />WARNING:  If you can sincerely appreciate implicit and explicit violence against humans, some of which is unique to this film, go for it.  If you are squeamish or intolerant of actualised madness, pass it.  Definitely not for the faint of heart (or kids either, please).<br /><br />There is some nudity, admiringly good sex, and lots of gore - particularly novel treatments of old themes that are unique in my film-going experience.  Superb writing.  The originators of the film must be absolute perverts to think up this storyline.  The reality is that there are bad people in the world, just like these characters, who are waiting, waiting for you to show up in their town.  You've been warned.<br /><br />Having traveled all over the world for business or pleasure, I see now how this could have happened to me anywhere, anytime.  That's the hook - this literally can happen to you.  Hey, if you've ever traveled outside the United States, and you don't think this film is scary - I'LL give you your money back!<br /><br />\\"Hostel\\" treads a path that few films have taken, and does it quite well.<br /><br />Definitely a film for your library.
1558216847|5.0|i read this based on a suggestion from a friend and just loved it. i cant believe i have never heard of it before. i think i put this book down once since i started reading it. this is a great survival story and you feel like you are with slavomir during his party's trek.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|As the title states, I have never reviewed an item before. However, I waited patiently for over a year for this album to be released. The entire time I wondered how can anything top \\"Fallen\\". My wait has finally ended and without a doubt this is the best follow-up album I have ever listened to. This statement from someone that anxiously awaited Def Leppard's follow-up to \\"Pyromania\\" among many, many others over the years. Don't take my word for it. Listen and enjoy it for yourself.

I'm a comic book fan, a movie fan, and an X-Men fan; I loved the prior two installments on just about every level and I count comic book feature \\"Batman Begins\\" among the all-time great movies, period. <br /> <br />That said, this is a film that exists for only the lowest common denominator of movie-goer. Any essay on the correspondence between lowering IQs and rising low-brow entertainment should rightfully include this series of films. Where the first two were intelligent metaphors for the world in which we live, the third is a meaningless action sequence that serves as a backdrop to poor performances, weak dialogue and overwrought cliche. (Let me clear, it even fails as an action sequence - the opening night crowd I saw the film with were derisively hissing the bridge sequence by the films... er, \\"climax.\\") <br /> <br />Where the first two greeted the audience with a knowing wink, the third merely throws garbage at the audience without regard to character development or plot. It's a confusing bore, and even if one attempts to care about the outcome, the silliness drives one to distraction.  <br /> <br />If you've seen what Brett Ratner did to the \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" property, you can guess what he did to this one. Don't put yourself through it.
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|There are only two movies in the past three years that were so bad that I stopped watching midway through. The first was Serenity. The second was Brick. The title of my Serenity review was, \\"Looks Like Bad TV. Quacks Like Bad TV. Must Be.....\\" Since I already used that title for a review, I didn't use it again for this review of Brick, but rest assured it fits.<br /><br />Brick, like Serenity, must have a serious cult following, because at the time of this writing both Brick and Serenity have an average of 4 stars and enough reviews to have led me to believe that the 4-star average ratings must have some credibility.<br /><br />So I tried Brick based on the 4-star average rating.<br /><br />Back at the beginning of the year I also tried Serenity based on the same premise: \\"If it's got 4 stars it's got to be at least halfway decent, right?\\" Wrong. Apparently the common denominator for both Brick and Serenity are the abundance of teens and young adults that for whatever reason are captivated by the plethora of bad TV plaguing prime time that targets the teen through 24 demo.<br /><br />Brick is about high schoolers that all somehow have the dispositions, intelligence, vocabularies, mannerisms and lifestyles of no-personality 30+ year olds. There's murder, a criminalistic \\"Kingpin\\" complete with posse & bodyguards, a high society seductress and a hero (all the stuff found in any normal high-school, no?...uh, not really). The high school hero is looking for those responsible for the murder and he gets mixed up with the high school Kingpin, his high school henchman and the high school high society seductress.<br /><br />Don't worry, no spoilers on the way....I didn't finishing watching, remember?<br /><br />I'm thinking that Brick was trying to be like a high-schoolers-go-Pulp-Fiction or something. But it played more like a bad, R-rated after-school movie special.<br /><br />So, if you haven't guessed already, I'd recommend completely missing this one. Don't buy it; don't rent it; don't waste 2 hours of your time when it comes on cable.<br /><br />And don't be bamboozled by the 4-star average rating.t rent it; don't waste 2 hours of your time when it comes on cable.<br /><br />And don't be bamboozled by the 4-star average rating.
B00005RDRO|5.0|With it seems less and less worth watching on television, my wife and I can always count on many a good laugh when watching this outstanding classic.  Funny without having to be vulgar, this movie should be in everyones collection.
0786915749|1.0|Ok so when I first started reading the book I thought all right this is ok.  And the book went along and I still thought it was ok good at times but just a decent book.  Then I finished the book and I realized something.  Nothing had happened really.  There was nothing to tell you what the overall plot would be for the triolgy it was just them going from once place to the other.  Its like oh there is a ghost we should follow it, yeah because that is such a smart thing to do.  This book just annoyed me so much because nothing happend in it.  I don't really understand why so many people love this book.  This book is average at best and not much else.
B00005JKNF|5.0|It's a film that screams out to be viewed again and again. Just enough English humor to keep it jumping but it doesn't ruin this great film, a tongue in cheek mystery. Of course, the police inspector is a buffoon. My highest rating for this one.<br /><br />REVISION: I thought I should tell more of the story, so here goes:<br /><br />An aristocratic English family (1920s) assembles at the patriarch's estate for a bird hunt and weekend get-together. Most of the male family members are stogy, snooty buffons, but the women of the family have their eye on the (money) ball.<br /><br />The servants, some incredibly shrewd and some sheepish, mostly live vicariously through the lives of their masters. But a few have agendas and the interactions of the family with the servants is incredibly meshed but still quite coherent.<br /><br />The old patriarch is murdered after he has ticked off nearly every family member in the household -- there is no shortage of suspects!<br /><br />Again, this is a superb film.
0930289528|5.0|Sales of V for Vindetta increased dramatically when the movie came out earlier this year.  I happened to be one of those guys that wanted to read the graphic novel before I saw the movie.  I am so grateful that I did.<br /><br />The movie is somewhat entertaining and I did enjoy it, but the Wackowski brothers turned the classic story into a Bush bashing movie which upset me greatly.  In fact, you can in several places while pausing the movie see signs that say some horrific things about President Bush.  Very childish behavior in my opinion but I digress.  This is not a review of the movie but of the book in which it is based off.<br /><br />There is a reason why Alan Moore wanted nothing to do with the movie and didn't want his name anywhere to be seen.  The movie completely waters down the beauty of this book.  V for Vindetta tells a great story of a futuristic London that has fallen into corrupt government hands, and how one lone person is able to motivate thousands that have been depressed into fighting back for their freedoms and rights.<br /><br />Very intertaining and highly recommended for any comic book fan.  Read it.  Think about it, and read it again.  V for Vindetta is worth every penny.<br /><br />Note to parents:  This book is not for younger readers but for mature audiences only.  Adult situations, adult language, nudity and sex, is throughout this book.  Reader Discression is advised.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|This film is a must-see DVD!  I first saw it in the theaters and have recently purchased the DVD - I highly recommend you do the same.  The humor that is presented through satirical commentary is absolutely brilliant.  The entire storyline overflows with the underlying reality of the state of affairs in big-business lobbying, best represented by the tactics and antics of the main character.   <br /> <br />Prone to hyberbole, this film presents a comically exaggerated lifestlye of the big-business lobby.  However funny the film is, it contains an important ethical and moral component.  Yes, the main character does a lot of awful things at the expense of his basic human dignity (which he refers to as a \\"flexible moral standard\\"), but he is also a real human being who loves his son very much which leads to moments of occasional liminality when the main character straddles the line between ethical and unethical. <br /> <br />All in all, this is wonderfully done with an outstanding cast.  Rent or buy it today!
0930289234|5.0|In 2004 Time magazine came out with the Top 100 novels of all time.  In the top 25 was the only comic book/graphic novel in the bunch called The Watchmen.  Up to that point I had only heard of the book.  I had never had a desire to read it until I saw it was on this top 100 list.<br /><br />My interest was perked and I purchased a copy and I was blown away by how powerful and perfect this book is.  Not only is the art fantastic and perfect for the story being told, but the writing is the best there has ever been.<br /><br />Alan Moore is a genius when it comes to his story telling.  He's pretty insane personally but most genius' are in their own right.  I don't want to give any of the story away but say this novel is for anyone.  It's not just for comic book fans but for anyone wanting to read one of the greatest novels ever written.<br /><br />Note to parents:  This novel is not intended for younger readers.  At the time it could have pulled an R-Rating and definitely an M-Rating still today.  This book is packed with adult situations, adult language, as well as some nudity.
B00005JKYI|5.0|Yes it's homoerotic, the dancers are too good, and there's so much silly about this film, but it's so much darn fun. Guys, this is the perfect movie to watch with girls. I've not seen a girl yet who doesn't love this movie (and even loves making fun of this movie!). Invite a girl to your house, have this movie playing, and she'll have a good time with you.
B000H305U0|3.0|Usually I'm not the type to get the full cd - hello, this is the 21st century, get an iPod and download only the good stuff. :)  But I'm in the process of buying a new computer and haven't had my iPod hooked up to a compy in almost a year.  sucks.  I'm so addicted to music and there's been a lot of great new beats out there that I've been forced to buy a couple cds (scary I know, and prolly a waist of money.)  So I was terribly wary about getting this cd and I feel like it's important to let the rest of the population know wether it's worth it.  Listen, if you like Timberlake's unexpected new sound, then yes, it rocks!  Track 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are GRRRREAT!  but the others - boring.   <br /> <br />Sexyback and My Love - I'm sure you've already heard on the radio.  If you fell in love with those, Future Sex/Love Sounds and Love Stoned are similar.  What Goes Around is a little slower, but it's still got a catchy sound that sticks in your head.  The lyrics to What Goes Around are somewhat cliche since Alicia Keys' Karma.  He's basically saying the same thing.   <br /> <br />If you have an iPod and want to know which tracks to download - these are the fab five.  Check em out and decide for yourself.  But alas, music is always going to be subject to personal preference.  If you listen to music for the message - then the lyrics to some of the other \\"boring sounding\\" songs have more depth so you might want to check them out too.  But if you really don't care...like me ;) ...bring on the slutty songs with a sound that can actually hold your attention! <br /> <br />And warning - Love Stoned and What Goes Around have really odd endings... reminiscent of the ending to BEP's Don't Phunk with my Heart.  After a while you get used to them so whatever! :)  It's just, all the sudden he sings the same words but with a mini remix...kinda weird and drawn-out.  *shrug*
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Erykah Badu's music always has soul and such energy and this, her latest album, does not disappoint.  I've heard her several times live in Dallas and she is fantastic in person, she brings an edge to her soulful songs when she's live.  Being of the caucasion persuasion, which is to say im tan with a white primer, I dont always agree with Ms. Badu's, uh let's say Afro Centric views, but I respect her opinions and I love her talent.  Highly recommended.
B00004Y2FT|4.0|Ask any Cocteau Twin to choose 18 songs for a compilation, and you're likely to get a different response each time.  Still, Stars and Topsoil leaves out too many first-rate songs to be considered truly representative collection.<br /><br />Let's start with track one.  Why was Blind Dumb Deaf chosen to represent the Garlands album, and not Wax and Wane?  Scanning though the rest of the list, I picked up on some glaring omissions, including From the Flagstones, Crushed, and Oomingmak.<br /><br />Furthermore, a proper collection would have encompassed the whole of their catalogue, not just up to 1990.  Bluebeard, anyone?<br /><br />Sorry to say it, but I think this compilation, not being a true \\"best-of\\", is a waste of money for all but those completely unfamiliar with the Twins' music.
B000EYK4KI|1.0|I was trying to watch this film to the end, but I almost could not do it. The biggest problem with this film that there is no original story line, absolutely \\"0\\" chemistry between Brad and Angelina, acting talent also equals to zero.  Cheap all the way through, don`t waste your time. It`s a pitty Brangelina got paid for making this film... I should have got paid for watching it. Don`t fall for old Hollywood tricks. Make up your own mind... and rent another movie.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|This ALbum is total trash, the only good track is \\"Get Together\\" Other than that...........its totally not worth it. But everyone writing reviews are madonna queens so they will enjoy anything she puts out.

Unfortunately I have to give it 1 star or else amazon wont let me post it!
B000H305U0|1.0|All you need to do is imitate the vocals of a famous black singer (or two) and hire a big name producer like Timbaland (or the Neptunes) to give you the R&B sound you're incapable of making. That's pretty much it. I'm sick of this weasel. He said in an interview that Taylor Hicks couldn't sing in a bucket. Well, Justin's lucky in this day and age that you don't need much talent to become a successful singer. You just rely on looks, big name producers, and sex. Justin's not a great vocalist,  he's average and  he still sings like a girly girl. On this new \\"Futuresex/Lovesounds\\" CD he's still doing his Michael Jackson imitation as well as Prince. I didn't like this CD at all because it's just like most music you hear today: all style and very little to no substance.  I looked at a few reviews where some people said they weren't thrilled with the CD but they enjoyed the beats. That's all this CD consists primarily of- hot, rhythmic beats and that's thanks to Timberland .That's it. Justin sounds like a woman in \\"Undefined\\" and \\"Damn Girl.\\" He also sounds like a woman in \\"(Another Song) All Over Again\\". He tries to go for an old school R&B vibe with that song, but it doesn't work. \\"Until The End Of Time\\" sounds like it ripped off  Prince's \\"Beautiful Ones.\\" The beat from \\"Futuresex/Lovesound\\" sounds like it's sampled from an old school song, which escapes me at the moment.  I didn't enjoy one single song on here, \\"Sexyback\\" and \\"Damn Girl\\" song irritated me the most. Anyway, Justin Timberfake is another player in the R&B genre who's bringing nothing innovative to the table. He better hope that nothing ever happens to Timberland  or that Timberland doesn't raise his fees. Holler!
B0006J28BO|4.0|Haru didn't expect to rescue at cat on the way home from school, and she definitely didn't expect it to thank her. She didn't expect to be showered with catty gifts as a token of thanks, and she definitely didn't expect to be whisked away to the Kingdom of cats to marry their prince. Still, when you're as accident prone as Haru is, you often stumble into unexpected places. It's a good thing that Baron, a living replica of a cat, has a plan to save her. <br /> <br />This is the world of \\"The Cat Returns\\", a 2002 Studio Ghibli animated feature, featuring some of the ideas and characters from on of their previous features \\"Whisper of the Heart\\". Now I don't know anime, but I know what I like, and I liked this. It was a very cutesy film, while still being charged with energy and humour. The cats are all animated really nicely too, and given really interesting personalities. I just got a cat this year, and it was interesting to spot some of the her quirks in the citizens of the Cat Kingdom. <br /> <br />The English dub features Anne Hathaway (of The Princess Diaries 1 & 2) as the voice of Haru, and she captures the klutzy girl's feelings and awkwardness really well. Good casting choice, I thought. <br /> <br />There are a couple of special features on the DVD. There's \\"The Making of the Cat Returns\\", a Japanese documentary with interviews from various members of Studio Ghibli. According to the documentary, this film was originally going to be a 20 minute animation for a theme park! Some of the origins of their films are so odd. There's also some original Japanese trailers, and a few other goodies. <br /> <br />Worth a look for anime fans, lovers of fantasy and cats.
B00003XB8K|5.0|Even non-Enigma fans can appreciate this CD. There is not a single weak track on here and the songs range from really upbeat (Push the Limits) to slow and relaxing (Traces), uplifting (Between Mind and Heart) to almost angry sounding (Camera Obscura). If you don't get any other Enigma album, get this one (and maybe \\"Le Roi...\\"). I mean \\"Smell of Desire\\" is pretty much worth the price of the CD all by itself.
B000002H97|5.0|Although it is somewhat true that Metallica sells out with their self-titled fifth album, ignore those accusations because the music here is just way too damn good.  (Now as far as Load and all albums there after are concerned, that's a different story.)  If this is a sellout effort, then, well, I guess I'm a sucker because I still love every second of the Black Album even after all these years--something I cannot say about ...And Justice for All.  And these are the many reasons why:<br /><br />1) Enter Sandman - Unfortunately overplayed more than almost any other Nineties anthem, this is obviously one of the most essential metal songs ever and probably one of the top rock songs ever. 10/10<br /><br />2) Sad But True - Picking up right where `Sandman' left off in the quality department, this is possibly Metallica's most underappreciated song and one of my all-time favorites. 10/10<br /><br />3) Holier Than Thou - The funny thing is that this is one of the least memorable songs on Metallica and it's still a damn fine tune.  Great bass in this song, love how it progressively picks up after the solo. 8/10<br /><br />4) The Unforgiven - A ballad? No sir, not by a long shot.  The band's most accessible number outside of `Sandman' and some of the best lyrics of Metallica's career. 10/10<br /><br />5) Wherever I May Roam - A fine song that has had its eastern influences ripped off on several occasions, Live's Secret Samadhi for example.  A fan favorite. 8/10<br /><br />6) Don't Tread On Me - I've never understood why THIS has never been the album's staple track, it's so good I could listen to it all week and still salivate at the massive riffs. Easily 10/10<br /><br />7) Through The Never - Fast, heavy, addictive, dark, fun, this is one of those songs that not a lot of people know but those who do love it.  Sing it with me!  `On/through/the/nev/ver!' 8/10<br /><br />8) Nothing Else Matters - Alright already...Yes I suppose this is a ballad but it's no issue at all, considering the quality.  Sounds even better on 99's S&M. 9/10<br /><br />9) Of Wolf And Man - Such a great way to compliment `Nothing Else Matters' and yet another splendid riff to go along with memorable lyrics.  Great song for a pre-game warm-up. 9/10<br /><br />10) The God That Failed - This reeks of old school Metallica, namely `The Thing That Should Not Be' and `Blackened' from the 80's.  A true deep-cut that sounds even better next to the overplayed anthems before it. 9/10<br /><br />11) My Friend Of Misery - Most say it's a slight step back in the expected quality but Metallica still does no wrong.  Unjustly overlooked, can't believe some consider this filler. 8/10<br /><br />12) The Struggle Within -Just a typical Metallica song, meaning it is, of course, excellent. The `Go!' then awesome riff after the solo gets me every time. 9/10<br /><br />Amazingly consistent and one of the best albums ever, even if it did inevitably lead to the downfall of a great band.  I'd even go so far as to say that this is the pinnacle of Metallica's long and illustrious career, the best album they ever released.e at all, considering the quality.

B000I0QK74|5.0|I have the Hallmark version of this album -- love it!  I'm particularly fond of the duet between JT and Natalie Cole on \\"Baby It's Cold Outside.\\"  JT shows a little friskiness with his partner, and the song's a delight.   <br /> <br />This isn't your run-of-the-mill Christmas album -- it's truly enjoyable to listen to.  I didn't put it away until late in January.

B000067J1H|1.0|A lot of reviewers who like this movie tell people who didn't like the movie to read the book. Why read the book when we are trying to watch a good movie? Let's be honest here. The movie has a lot of fans but it is a bad movie to an average person who is happy with life. I watched it thinking it is a modern classic or something, but what a disappointment. Don't watch the movie unless you have nothing to do.
B000H30B2C|3.0|First, the good stuff.  OK, incredible CGIs.  OK?  Great monkey, great island,etc, etc.  Loved the cast except for Jack Black (who I generally love).  I had a hard time accepting him in this role.  Bugs were great, tribe was great, boat was great.  See, the pieces of the puzzle were all really nice pieces but somehow they didn't fit together.  Since I thought the movie was already about 30 minutes too long, I can't believe they're putting out an extended version.  Why?  So we can see more of a love interest between beauty and the beast?  Too much of a chase scene through New York.   <br />I believe what worked in the LOTR trilogy didn't work as well here.  Still love Peter but, like everyone else in the known world, would love to see him take on the Hobbit.
B000EGDC14|5.0|This is a very solid album with some great standout tracks.  Great dark chords with powerful distorted vocals.  Thumping and energetic.  I feel like my body chemistry is aligning itself to the beat. :)
B000FTWB7G|3.0|...and I say 'passable', because, although this sophomore album isn't quite as melodious or, lyrically speaking, as fresh and rich as Fallen, it should still be accredited for trying to be 'deep' with its subject matter.   At their very core, Evanescence still try to be substantial, and only partially fail to deliver because of the way the songs are wirtten and directed musically.    One can probably forgive the band for not surpassing such timeless piano ballads as My Immortal, but what can't be ignored is having to deal with at least 7 tracks on the album that all sound too similar to one another. [Cloud Nine, Snow White Queen, Lacrymosa, Lose Control, The Only One, Your Star, All that I'm living for] are monotonous, repetitive, and ultimately boring songs that lack instrumental variety and catchy melodies. The piano and synthesisers that gave a 'body and soul' to most of the guitar riffs on Fallen, don't play as much a significant role here, leaving us with nothing more than skeletons for songs. To top that, the new guitarist doesn't seem to have quite the creativity and talent of Ben Moody (previous guitarist that co-produced Fallen with Amy Lee).    However, there still seem to be a few songs that stand out relatively well: Sweet Sacrifice, Call me When You're Sober, Weight of the World, Lithium, Like You, and Good Enough all capture and seduce in their own way, and can arguably be compared to some titles on Fallen.  Not so much by coincidence, they are strategically placed on the album, the first four successively following each other at the top of the playlist; Good Enough, being the orchestral lament, is placed as an end note to the dark but poetic manifesto, and Like You, somewhere in the middle to balance things out with the less interesting tracks.    All things said, the album begs for a few listens to be fully enjoyed; at least for the stand-out tracks.  Sweet Sacrifice almost lives up to Going Under as the opening of the album. Call me When You're Sober almost lives up to Bring me to Life as first single. Lithium and Weight of the World almost capture the essence of My Immortal and Everybody's Fool.   Still, one can safely say that they aren't exactly at par with the originals.    That is why, in my opinion, The Open Door also remains almost -but not quite- as much of a success as Fallen.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|Watch 1 or 2, don't waste your time. No backstories to speak of on new character, or what happened to some missing. Doubt it's the final.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|The Open Door is a wonderful follow-up to the multi-platinum success Fallen.  Balsamo and Lee form a great writing pair for this particular album.  From the egyptian sounding first track Sweet Sacrifice, to the southern sounding Good Enough, this album has a wide array of style. The performers show off their true talent with the writing, and the production of this album.  With gothic waltzes like Lacrymosa to the dark insanity of Lose Control and especially with the dark, angry lyrics, this album is one that won't easily be forgotton. I definitely reccomend this album to everybody!

Even when you finish you are still think about it weeks later. This is a book you will never forget. It also wants you to know more about the author. I would put this book on my top ten list, which includes book that are off the beaten path that years later you will never forget. Books that draw you in and you feel the happiness, the fear, soddness, pain and that people realy have no clue. If you want all this, then you must read this with a truly open mind, only than can you enjoy it, Like Suzie points out their is different kinds of Heaven and maybe the kind of hell for the villan.
B000GFLE1S|4.0|They say that you should never judge a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes. I don't think they are talking about red-leather, stiletto-heeled boots with a pocket for a whip, though.<br /><br />Based on a true story, it features a Northampton men's shoe factory on the verge of collapse. Charlie Price (portrayed by Joel Edgerton) is faced with the disintegration of his family's 115-year-old business after his father's sudden death. He doesn't want to be the Price who closes the factory, but as he repeatedly asks of his employees as he is laying them off, \\"What can I do?\\" Enter Sarah-Jane Potts as Lauren, who actually answers his rhetorical question: \\"Change the product.\\" After a chance meeting with a drag queen, Charlie begins a quest to save the factory by producing shoes for a niche market: transvestites.<br /><br />Directed by Julian Jarrold, Kinky Boots features a cast of relatively unknown actors, though one, at least, certainly deserves fame. Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is best known in the United States for his recent role as Denzel Washington's partner in Inside Man, steals the show as Lola, a nightclub performer who roars that red is the color of sex, danger, and signs that say Do Not Enter. The extras used in the shoe factory are real factory workers and the extras in the transvestite club scenes are real transvestites; they give this film a richer texture.<br /><br />The script succeeds in showing how uncomfortable both of the main characters are in each other's worlds, though eventually they ease in to each other's lives. The cinematography masterfully contrasts the muted colors of Northampton with the vivid colors of the London club scene, then gradually mixes the two together, visually merging Charlie's world with Lola's. The soundtrack of torch songs and soul music adds even more to the merger. The film's one fault may be a rather undeveloped and ultimately pointless subplot regarding Charlie's love life.<br /><br />Though it takes him a while, Charlie eventually takes a walk in Lola's boots. What he learns is something that we could all do with a lesson in: appreciation.le, Charlie eventually takes a walk in Lola's boots.

B000006XDX|3.0|OK, so it's not the classic Camel sound, but it is still better than the stuff you heard on the radio back then.  It was a way for me to sell Progressive rock to commercial music listenners and it worked.  They can understand it, and it has some great licks that are a part of the Camel sound.  Then they buy a more progressive album like Nudes, and now are into progressive rock or they just like it.  With this album you can play it at parties were you have diverse groups of music lovers. <br />
0375758992|5.0|Alexandra Fuller's \\"Don't Let's Go To the Dogs Tonight\\" will bring you into her world of a childhood spent in the wilds of Africa.  Hers is a colorful memoir that you won't soon forget.  While reading this book, I literally carried it with me everywhere I went so that I could read it during any spare moments I had during the day.  Run, don't walk, to purchase this book and buy a spare to share with everyone you know!
1932907009|5.0|So, you've read McKee and perhaps been to his seminars and studied character development and scene structure and all that other necessary \\"writer\\" stuff and maybe you've even written a screenplay or two that friends told you were \\"really something special\\" and \\"neat!\\" and maybe you've even got an agent and had those scripts passed around town - and passed ON by everyone in town, much to your and your agent's dismay.  Perhaps you're sitting in your kitchen with a half-empty bottle of vodka staring at the WGA-West logo screensaver you made for your computer slowing moving around the desktop wondering \\"what went wrong?\\".  At about this time an angel should appear floating above the Donald and Daisy Duck salt and pepper shakers holding a copy of \\"Save The Cat! The Last Book On Screewriting You'll Ever Need.\\"  The angel will smack the bottle of vodka out of your hand and replace it with the book, placidly telling you to stop whining and read.  Within the covers of this blessed little tome lies the answer to your question.  The angel then stuffs a bill for $13.57 in your front pocket and disappears with a *pop* and a faint whiff of patchouli.  Sheesh.  Angels. <br /> <br />But seriously. <br /> <br />I love this book.  A few of the other reviewers have used the phrase \\"a-ha!\\" and that's what this book was to me.  It was so plain!  So obvious!  So maddeningly simple!  So logical.  Blake has just said in a very understandable way what's what with the whole \\"how do I crack the commercial, sell-able script nut?!?\\"  And that's what this book tells you. <br /> <br />I recently took the Robert McKee 3-day seminar and it was incredible.  I highly recommend it.  Then I recommend taking all the stuff that McKee teaches you and apply it directly to what Blake teaches you and you can't freeking lose.  If you can write a story, and by that I mean \\"a GOOD story in the classical idiom\\", and if you can structure that story according to the Blake Snyder Beat Sheet, then you can make moneyas a screenwriter. <br /> <br />This book is not about the art of storycraft.  It's about the craft of screenplay structure.  Which is an art in and of itself.  I think.  So, I guess it's really about the art of screenplay structure.  Or the craft.  Which ever you prefer.  That's not the point.  The point is...oh heck, just get off my back, ok?  Read the book.  Sell a script for a change. <br /> <br />Cheers, <br />Joe Whyte <br />Walt Disney Feature Animation
B000002542|5.0|I was instantly a fan of Journey (in high school) when this first album hit the market.  It has both a hard edge and some very progressive work, all on the same album.  Couldn't wait to see what they would come out with next...and the second album - \\"Look Into The Future\\" kept the energy and unique sound going!  It became clear they were well on their way to major R&R success.  The third release - \\"Next\\" - didn't quite compare to the first two albums but it was still rockin'.   <br /> <br />The difference between the first three albums and the \\"pop-rock\\" success of what followed was Steve Perry...it is also the reason I never bought another Journey album! <br /> <br />Gregg Rollie's vocals complemented the band's musical talent rather than obscuring it behind S.P. <br /> <br />If you want to hear what Journey really sounded like before S.P., you have to get this album/CD!

0880793589|5.0|I love this set of 64 cards.  Based on the ancient wisdom of the I Ching this card set is simply the most creative, brilliant way to problem solve ever invented.  By using 4 archetypes, Explorer, Artist, Judge and Warrior, author Roger von Oech shows us how to use our creativity to to its fullest potential... in a really simple way with lots of examples.  And sharing the Whack Pack with friends has led to many memorable discussions and projects!  There's a reason this product has been around for such a long time.  It's fantastic.
B00005JPAD|5.0|It's a tricky business adapting a foreign movie for an American audience. Martin Scorsese's \\"The Departed\\" captures all the best elements of the original film \\"Infernal Affairs\\" and works traditional Scorsese themes and material into the film making it very much his own and every bit the equal to the Chinese film. Featuring outstanding performances all around perhaps this film will finally earn Scorsese the Oscar for Best Director that he deserved for \\"Raging Bull\\" over twenty years ago.<br /><br />Two state trooper academy graduates one an undercover officer named Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and a mole in the department Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) working for crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson)have opposite goals. Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) charge Costigan with gathering as much dirt as possible on Sullivan so they can finally take him out. They work up a false history for Costigan which includes a brief stint in prison to create credibility. By comparison Sullivan is a boy scout who rises to the top of his department rapidly working for Ellerby (Alec Baldwin)in a rival department. Both are charged with ferriting out the mole in their respective organizations and both are romancing the same woman (Vera Farmiga) without ever meeting.<br /><br />It's a brilliantly constructed game of cat and mouse with each playing the respective role at one point in time. Filled with brilliant visuals that echo the themes of the script adapted by William Monahan (\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\")from the script by Siu Fai Mak and Felix Chong the film manages to stay true to the elements that worked best in the Chinese film while incorporating elements unique to \\"The Departed\\". DiCaprio and Damon give complex, compelling performances as opposite sides of the same coin. Nicholson plays Costello with psychopathic intensity at times without going too far over the top. The entire cast gives stellar performances but I'd like to note tree actors in particularly who do the most with their limited roles--Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen (who replaced two other actors that had to drop out--Robert DeNiro and Gerard McSorley)and Mark Whalberg all three give intense performances and inhabit their characters fully. Vera Farmiga handles her role of Madolyn equalling the big boys despite the fact that her character isn't given as much screen time by comparison. Special note should also be made of actor Ray Winstone (\\"The Proposition\\", \\"King Arthur\\" and \\"Cold Mountain\\") who gives a nice edgy performance as Mr. French.<br /><br />The film runs 2 hours and 22 minutes. Scorsese uses every minute to allow the actors to build their characters or for brilliant set pieces. The film does sag a bit towards the middle but that's partially due to its complex set up for the story during the first twenty minutes of the film.particularly who do the most with their limited roles--Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen (who replaced two other actors that had to drop out--Robert DeNiro and Gerard McSorley)and Mark Whalberg all three give intense performances and inhabit their characters fully.

B00000373U|5.0|I have owned this album for a few years.  I always liked it, but I just didn't give it the time it deserved.  When I bough XO earlier this year, I absolutely fell in love with Elliott Smith.  I played that album a million times, for it was immediately accessible to me.  I was convinced that it was better than Either/Or.  However, when I decided that I would give Either/Or another spin after becoming more familiar with Smith, the true power of this album jumped right out at me!  I heard the songs like I had never heard them before, and as I kept listening to Either/Or, the songs kept getting better and better.  Either/Or is my favorite because it is not as heavily produced as XO, which gives the songs more meaning to me, but it is more diverse than Roman Candle or his self-titled album.  The songs are more somber and subdued than his songs on XO, but they are not as flat-out depressing as his earlier stuff (which, don't get me wrong, is just as amazing).  His lyrics on this album ring even truer to me now than those on XO.  It just took me an extra step (XO) to get to this masterpiece.  My advice for new listeners is to start out with XO.  If you hate it, Elliott is not for you.  If you love it, buy this one. Once you fall madly in love with this album, all of his other albums should be greatly enjoyable to you as well.
B00005JL3A|1.0|....well not the worst, but I thought this film was extremely over rated by many people. I've noticed, people who like this movie are not fans of ZOmbi movies or this is probably one of the first zombi films they have seen. If you love zombi films dont watch this piece -o- junk. If you want a good zombi film try night of the living dead(the original),Dawn of the dead(the original, Zombi, Dead next door, or any low budget gory disgusting Zombi film that blows this teeny bopper movie out of the water.
B00005JKL8|4.0|Okay.  Owen Wilson is about as believable playing a navy navigator as Rosie O'Donnell playing Mother Teresa.  And hasn't Gene Hackman pretty much cornered the market playing cranky commanders?  But who cares:  BEHIND ENEMY LINES would work even if the leads were Henry Gibson and Larry the Cable Guy.<br /><br />This film--with its contrived plot about an American pilot getting shot down over war-torn Bosnia--works through its visuals.  Video telling a story is the essence of cinema, and director John Moore succeeds masterully via a breathless array of action scenes.  But it's not just \\"action\\":  cinematographer Brandan Galvin delivers the action and suspense from countless angles and wrap-around shots; the slowing down, then ratcheting up of the film speed gives this movie an X-Box look.  And it's all grand fun.<br /><br />The cat-and-mouse aspect of this film--as Wilson's character runs for his life under ominous grey skies--is perfected by the cold-blooded performance of Vladimir Mashkov.  The chainsmoking, sweatpant-wearing Russian actor is the perfect predator.  To top it all off, director Moore even takes a potshot or two at politically correct international posturing; that makes BEHIND ENEMY LINES even more fun.  Come to think of it, Larry the Cable Guy would look real good dodging semi-automatic gunfire.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON
0553275569|5.0|If you've only seen the dreadful movie version of this book, stop reading these reviews and click back to the ordering page right now! There's little relationship between the bombastic (and highly inaccurate) film version and Wolfe's wonderfully detailed and nuanced book. Although his \\"New Journalism\\" style is becoming a bit dated compared to the newer space histories and autobiographies, there's still no better introduction to the whole \\"figter jock\\" mentality that permeated NASA's astronaut culture at least through the 1980s, even among the non-pilot astronauts.
B000FTWB7G|1.0|Who could forget about their debut album?  Smash hits like \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Bring Me To Life\\" were brought to the light by the Daredevil movie. From then on, the hits kepts on coming with the likes of Going Under and Holding My Last Breath... in short, \\"Fallen\\" was excellent.    \\"The Open Door\\" doesn't even compare. Long gone are the power melodies and soul touching lyrics. The songs are just plain and bland. The only songs that I thought were fairly decent were \\"Lithium\\" and \\"Like You\\". If I had to rate the other songs out of 10, none would score over a 5.    It strikes me deep to say that \\"The Open Door\\" was a disappointment.
B000BNI90O|5.0|There are no further words one can read after you have read all of the previous reviews - there simply isn't anything else to say about Howard Shore's genius in composing the music for such a monumental film (undertaken by Peter Jackson) - a tribute to JRR Tolkien.<br /><br />What there is left to say is: When will the 2d set \\"The Two Towers - Complete Recordings\\" become available?  If you are a true and loyal fan (never mind \\"fan\\"), if you can appreciate something fine in the realm of \\"classic music that will endure for the ages\\", then you can't just stop with the 1st set: \\"Fellowship, Complete Recordings\\".<br /><br />Does anyone know when we can expect the 2d set of complete recordings for The Two Towers?

1569242739|5.0|IsaChandra and Terry (I am referring to them like they're old friends, but I've never met them... but this is beside the point) are the Grand Poo-Bah's of Vegan Culinary (F)Arts. Vegan With A Vegeance, IsaChandra's solo effort, changed my so-called vegan life. There isn't a vegan cookbook to compare. And just when I thought it couldn't get any better, along come the cupcakes, which seriously might jeopardize my ability to wear fitted pants.<br /><br />I should mention that I live and breathe solely for the purpose of eating cupcakes. Everyone probably does, if we're honest with ourselves. If you, too, are the honest-with-yourself type, you definitely owe it to yourself to buy this cookbook faster than you can say banana-split-cupcakes. (OK, so did I mention that there's a recipe for banana split cupcakes, and a food-porn picture of them that will make you, um...., wet?) Last night, I went to bed with a cupcake frosted with ganache. You can bet my dreams were sweet.<br /><br />I don't even know what else to say. Really, it is my deepest wish that Terry and Isa take over the world, not just their cupcakes. But in the meantime (until the Vegan Revolution), I am gonna be eatin' me some cupcakes. And you aren't going to stop me.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I have this version on 2 sets of VHS tapes. I have the newer versions on DVD. Seriously though, I'm worn out on Star Wars. I don't even think I could sit through the originals again.<br /><br />It's time for Star Wars and Star Trek to give it a rest and let newer Sci-Fi like Dune, Firefly, Battle Star Galactica and stuff like that take its place.<br /><br />I can honestly say that I will not ever purchase the Star Wars saga again, not even when HD-DVD wins the HD wars and it is released there.
B00005JP5J|1.0|This is one of the few movies I have felt like walking out of.  My girlfriend, who wanted to see this film, agreed it was depressing.

B00004VXF2|1.0|Lou Reed has gotten so much out of so little in his prodigious recording career. In some ways I think he had more than a little Andy Warhol in him; cranking out so many albums with worthless tracks, almost tempting his audience to reject him while still reaping the monetary benefits from the music industry.<br /><br />This was Reed's best attempt at alienating everyone, with a double-album of harsh feedback, though it often sounds like a transistor radio that was deliberately set between two stations. Even at its initial release the debate was furious on whether it was Reed at his most creative genius - bringing avant-garde to a bigger audience - or if it was a joke and a means to get out of a bad record contract.<br /><br />I feel it was the latter and still wonder why the project retains a number of fans. Reed stopped laughing years ago and certainly can only shake his head in amazement that some people still don't get it.
B00011RPB0|5.0|I have seen this moving many times, and each time I discover new elements.  The two main characters Bob (Murray)  & Charlotte (Johannson) are traveling in Tokyo and having difficulty finding their place both in life and the unique culture that they are currently immersed in.  They are both highly intelligent, and I believe they truly appreciate the beauty of the Japanese culture, however, they feel bewildered that it does not seem to affect them in any meaningful way.  When they meet, they form an unexpected bond, which basically is the entire movie.  The relationship that emerges is really beautiful with elements of romance, admiration, restraint and even a sense of parental concern.  All these elements are subtly and fabulously woven into the performances by Murray and Johannson.  I love the scene when they fall asleep in the same bed while talking.  As Bob (Murray) doses off, he reaches out and puts his hand on her foot as she is curled up sleeping.  Very subtle, but very powerful.  My absolute favorite scene, however, is the very last scene as Bob says goodbye to Charlotte on the street.  Their embrace is so touching, and I LOVE the fact that we can't understand what he whispers to her.  It is as though they see in each other a part of themselves and together, they don't feel so \\"lost.\\" What they have in Tokyo, however, would probably be lost back home or somewhere else.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone.  I really think that this is one of those movies that you really just love, or don't.  I happen to love it!
0618680004|2.0|it is my opinion that dawkins have good intentions: that by killing (or disappearing) god, scientifically he, in one stroke solves all the religion-related (of which there are many and primary) problems (on one side) of this world. no people to kill for. no necks to cut for. no weekly repetative rituals. no guilt to bear. no arguements about who has the more powerful backup. a peaceful godless utopia wholly man-made. but i don't think anyone believe this will actually happen. <br /> <br />for a scientist, dawkins seems all the more foolhardy to want this kind of impossible \\"regression\\". as they say, once the genie is out of the bottle there's no putting him back in . once, adam and eve ate the fruit of knowledge of good and evil (literal or symbolic) there's no way to un-eat anything.

B000GY729M|2.0|The Killers are a band that can put out singles that will be hits because oddly they sound like other songs that were hits.<br /><br /> I bought thier last album due to the song \\"Mr. Brightside\\" a song that sounded like the dance/electro song \\"Born Slippy\\" by Underworld. The vocals are very similar to that classic dance tune.<br /><br /> So for this album all the pre-interviews and pre-reviews said they were changing their style up a bit. This album is basically Hot Fuss 2. Even some of the electronic and bass sounds from their last album can be heard in this album. Brandon Flowers has 2 monotone singing styles, 1)a monotone yell and 2)a monotone soft, neither of which really sound like good singing. Plus he is stilling using effects on his vocals.<br /><br /> The music itself is not really memorable either. Those who compare them to U2 or Talking Heads are dead wrong.<br /><br /> The reason the singles will become memorable are the same reason the singles from their last album became memorable. They will be played on the radio ad naseum all winter and through next summer twice an hour 24/7.<br /><br /> Listen to the song \\"Red Flags and long Nights\\" by She Wants Revenge and then put on Bones by the killers. Witness the vocal similarities. That is the case with this album. You will be able to pick out so many vocal similarities that you could probably guess what Brandon Flowers had been listening to for the past year.<br /><br />The Killers = Hit singles from a cover band.
4789004546|3.0|It is more than 1 year since the last review for this book was written here, but reading through all the reviews there seems almost only to be positive comments about this book (the few negative comments there are, are rather unimportant things). BUT this book, used wrongly, may very well teach you Japanese that has never been heard from a native speaker's mouth.  <br /> <br />The information provided in the book is overwhelming and the explanations are almost too good to be true. However, depending on what you are trying to learn from the book, in may get you in big trouble.  <br />I am currently living in Japan and trying to pick up the language, and one thing I have come to understand is that there is not only one Japanese language ... but several. There is spoken langauge (actually there are 2 spoken languages, formal and informal), there is written language in books etc., there is news paper language, there is subtitle language (this is a fancy one!) and there are probably many more.  <br />This is not a unique feature to the Japanese language, that is not the point I am trying to make, but especially the difference between spoken language and written language in general is so destinctive, that you must be very well aware of it. <br /> <br />Now, what has all this to do with the book that this review is about? A whole lot!  <br />One evening when I sat at the dinner table studying my host brother (I live with a host family) came down from his room, saw me and placed himself on the chair besides me. He asked me what I was doing, and I of course answered `studying Japanese`. I was reading some random entry from \\"A dictionary of basic Japanese grammar\\" and when I showed it to him he started laughing and asked me why I was studying weird stuff like that. <br />Of course I had no idea what he was talking about, so he explained me that what I was studying was not useful at all. He had only read it once in a book but never heard it in a conversation (he is 30 and native Japanese). After consulting my hostdad he agreed as well, the stuff I was reading was useless and waste of time to study. <br /> <br />That little incident made me start asking my Japanese friends about stuff I had learnt from this book, and a lot of the entries they told, they never used in normal conversation.  <br />When purchasing this book and starting to use it as a study aid or grammar reference, you should definitely have some native speaker to ask, whether what you are studying is useful at all, because the authors of this book completely fail to provide any information on where you will find the grammar you are studying. Some of the grammatical expressions in book, you will never hear in a conversation and others are restricted to movie subtitles. So if you use this book without being critical you will end up with an understandable and grammatically correct but extremely odd Japanese.  <br /> <br />As I said earlier the Japanese used in subtitles is a category itself. \\"Subtitle Japanese\\" is a paradise for people who has used \\"A dictionary of basic Japanese grammar\\", but you will never hear it in daily life conversations.  <br />So please be careful to use this great but dangerous book!

I was truly absorbed in this book, and unfortunately, that does not happen as much as I'd like.

Overall I thought the story was very well done and I loved the way she wrapped everything up at the end of the tale. I'm looking forward to reading more from Ms. Setterfield.

There are many books on cartooning and animation but there has been a frustrating lack of material that really digs into the meat of the creative process behind character design.  Most books fall into categories that either narrowly focus on concept art from specific productions, or they discuss all facets of animation and cartooning and relegate character design to a single chapter and / or style.  This book recognizes that educational void and happily is helmed by a man who not only can draw, but can explain the REASONS behind the stylistic choices employed by the best designers out there.<br /><br />The REASONING is an important point that cannot be stressed highly enough and is what pushes this book beyond just another how-to-draw endeavor and becomes something that should be mandatory study material for anyone involved in the character creation process, from cartoonists, animators, sculptors, and 3D modelers, to storytellers, marketers, and producers.  Tom Bancroft explains the esthetics of design appeal and allows you to better understand how your choices affect the audience's psychological response to the character's look.  Going further you'll learn how to take that design awareness and modify your efforts to fit a wide range of stylistic applications so that your romanticly-loveable-yet-monstrous-and-scary frankenstein character can be drawn for an action-drama scenario or a slapstick-sendup.  You'll still have to figure out for yourself however what the boss means when he asks for you to make your work \\"more hip and edgy!\\".<br /><br />This book is filled to the brim with excellent and inspiring artwork and text which is both easy to comprehend and is satisfyingly complete.  When you're finished going over this book I guarantee you'll either have learned something useful or you'll be applauding Bancroft for finally delivering the goods on a topic so many of us love but haven't seen explored to this extent outside of the studio or classroom.<br /><br />Bravo, Tom, and thank you!of stylistic applications so that your romanticly-loveable-yet-monstrous-and-scary frankenstein character can be drawn for an action-drama scenario or a slapstick-sendup.

B000EULJLU|4.0|Its true there's not a lot new on this CD, and I thought it was a little boring when I first listened to it.  But then I found it worth listening to about 100 more times.  It has at least 7 good songs, and if you like Tool its definately worth buying.  If you're a Tool hater of course you won't like it, but then I'm not sure what you're listening to that's better.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|After reading the reviews, I was a bit sketchy about the fact that the original versions were simply going to be the 1994 Laserdisc masters - and yes there are a couple of problems to watch out for. 1) In really bright moments these versions 'clip' - which in the visual digital realm means the screen goes white for a split second - not ideal and a bit wearing on the eye. 2) The sound is a bit funny in bits - especially in Star Wars. Empire and ROTJ are a bit better but there is some sort of echoey slapback that occurs sometimes and the compression drags some stuff up to the front of the mix that really shouldn't be there.  <br />Apart from that, the films look and sound great. <br />All that said - it is awesome to finally have the original, untarnished versions on DVD and now that I have them (I was given them as a gift) I am very pleased indeed.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Regarding the previous reviewer..not to nitpick but Slayer was around about 5 years before Death, who's first LP wasn't until '87. They had demos earlier and also under the name Mantas, but they weren't in wide release. And Metal Church? I know a lot of people consider them thrash/speed/death metal but I always thought they were kind of just a cheesy metal band..not a criticism I like cheese!  They sold neckbraces with \\"Metal Church\\" printed on the side at their shows for chrissakes.  They always seemed more in the Maiden/Priest genre of metal compared to Slayer.    Anyhoo...In my humble opinion, In The Beginning there was Venom (1981's Welcome to Hell) Metallica (1983's Kill 'Em All), and Slayer (1983's Show No Mercy).  That was when the big change happened.  Motorhead was a pivotal band and very influential, but I would say that they were more of a precursor to things to come.  When \\"Ride the Lightning\\" came out in '84 the whole landscape changed.  Then came bands like Exodus, Megadeath, Celtic Frost/Hellhammer (Some people say that Death is the first Death Metal band but I'd put Hellhammer above them- see 1984's \\"Death Metal\\" compilation on Noise International), Destruction, VoiVod, Kreator, Dark Angel, Nuclear Assault, Bathory, Whiplash, etc.    Anthrax changed from power metal (Fistful of Metal) to speed metal (Armed and Dangerous).  A lot of hardcore bands started going speed metal..or punk/hardcore metal..or whatever like Agnostic Front, COC, English Dogs, DRI, and on and on..    Oh yeah this was supposed to be about Slayer. I would say start at the beginning with \\"Show No Mercy\\" and \\"Hell Awaits\\".  Both albums are great and are a bit more DIY and raw sounding (which I tend to prefer). I'm not sure what else I can say about RIB.  This was their first major label record on DefJam so it's it bit more cleaned up. It's still very heavy. It's got a lot of scary and violent imagery about Nazis and Satan that is also hilarious.  Not that there's anything funny aboutNazis..except in an absurd \\"Springtime for Hitler\\" kind of way. The lyrics are either really bad or really good depending on your POV.  If you smoke a lot of dope and take shop this will probably read like Yeats' \\"The Second Coming\\".  Um...It's very fast..they play very fast those Slayer guys. Visceral...yeah that's a good word to use...a real adrenaline rush.  Ellipses are my favorite...I still get a rush when I think of my first listen to Reign in Blood although now I listen to mostly Ace of Base, David Hasselhoff, and your mom screaming my name in bed.  The End.
B000001ELP|3.0|Ah, the much maligned \\"Music from the Elder.\\" This was a much anticipated release, and the first to feature Peter Criss replacement Eric Carr on drums. Fans only thought \\"Dynasty\\" and \\"Unmasked\\" were different - \\"The Elder\\" features spoken word, complex orchestral arrangements, and bad TV theme music. And some of the worse KISS music ever. <br /> <br />I have to be honest - I liked both \\"Dynasty\\" and (gasp) \\"Unmasked.\\" When I became a KISS fan via \\"Alive,\\" I also liked some of the pop bands of past and present. That KISS was now playing catchy pop tunes was actually okay with me. Paul was still one of the greatest rock singers on the planet, and Ace one of the best lead guitarists. I had no problem mixing these albums in with older KISS music. But \\"The Elder\\" was something totally different, and took some time to appreciate. No, it's not a great KISS album, but I'll take it over any of the non-makeup albums, save \\"Revenge.\\" \\"The Elder\\" has some great moments, but, admittedly, some bad as well. <br /> <br />1. Fanfare - an introductory instrumental that sounds like it came from the Krofft Supershow or a bad porn movie. WTF? <br />2. Just A Boy - You might hate this song, but you'll find yourself singing it later. Beautiful Paul falsetto vocals and good acoustic guitar work. I've always thought the lyrics were cool on this one.    <br />3. Odyssey - perhaps THE worse KISS song ever. Could have worked well in one of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies, maybe. This song is comical. I still crack up when Paul sings \\"That enchanted place\\" with his New York accent. <br />4. Only You - Good Gene track. Reminds me of his KISS solo record.  <br />5. Under the Rose - Another Gene track with a hokey cathedral-chant chorus. But it works for this album.  <br />6. Dark Light - Ace friggin' Frehley on a good tune. His vocal delivery is classic Ace, and some fantastic guitar work. <br />7. A World Without Heroes - A very well-written song and not a bad Gene ballad, if you can take Gene doing a ballad. The acoustic version from the later \\"Unplugged\\" recordings is fantastic. <br />8. The Oath - fantastic tune with crunchin' guitars and the first KISS track I ever heard with double bass drums. I guarantee you the crowd would go nuts if KISS played this live today. The falsettos were probably a bad idea on this one, but the song rocks regardless. <br />9. Mr. Blackwell - I've always hated this song. Could be the worse Gene song ever, although \\"No No No\\" off \\"Crazy Nights\\" gives it a tough run for the money. <br />10. Escape from the Island - instrumental that isn't great, but it doesn't suck, either. Ace should have just wailed all over this one. <br />11. I - Good KISS tune featuring Gene and Paul trading-off lead vocals. Rockin' tune with a great, positive message. <br /> <br />While some of the material is nothing short of bizarre, this still comes off as a KISS record. I know some fans loathe this album, and I guess I do in a way. Ace was so disappointed with the record it proved to be the last straw and he left the band. Ironically, the band rocked on the follow-up \\"Creatures of the Night,\\" what Frehly wanted to do all along. However, without the Space Man the band hired an array of 80's-style axe slingers that took the band in even another direction. \\"Who steers the ship through the stormy sea?\\" Sometimes the best thing to do in a storm is to stop and just go back where you came. It would be over 20 years before KISS would figure this out. <br />
0316172324|3.0|I finished reading it in one sitting as it is a highly readable and entertaining book. That said, it has to be admitted that it did not reveal any significant new bits of information to me. Most of the assertions of the author are already well known. Actually little has actually come out of the authors mind and a vast portion of the book is made up of nothing but a series of anecdotes collected from various sources. The anecdotes are interesting but I did not see any of them supporting his cotention that \\"blink\\" judgements are better than deliberate judgements.At times I felt as if I was reading a book on the art of marketing products and services to consumers.  <br />The reason that this book is a best seller is probably because, in this age of information overload, people just do not have time to analyse all, or even part of the information available before making a decision. So, when someone comes along and says that snap decisions made on the spur of the moment can be as good, or even better, than ones reached after much deliberation, people can heave a sigh of relief for all the hard work that this will save them. However the book does not provide any guidelines as to how this \\"power of thinking without thinking\\" can be implemented in real life, especially in life and death situations, or in situations that impact us greatly on an emotional level. Additionally, even Gladwell admits that only the snap judgements of experts in their own fields have any validity to speak of and the snap judgements of people not belonging to that field are nothing more that random guesses.  <br />Even after reading this book I do not think anyone will actually come to completely trust his or her \\"blink\\" decisions. If anything, I am afraid,  this book may lead many people to suddenly think themselves as expert mind-readers and lead them to form unjustifiable prejudices against many people who they meet by \\"thin slicing\\" a twitch of a facial muscle.  <br />If you want, just borrow this book from a library and make notes in your diary. The notes will occupy barely two pages. Save your money.
B000GIWRIY|5.0|There's always that occasion when a group goes through a periodic dry spell, and then they surprisingly releases one of their finest albums in a long time. Jethro Tull happened to be that one group. They had a comeback in 1987 with Crest of a Knave, mainly because people were happy to see the band return to guitar after spending the early '80s emphasizing too much on modern, synthetic-sounding synthesizers. It earned them a Grammy for Best Metal Performance, beating Metallica, which obviously angered the metalheads and puzzled Tull fans as well. Rock Island pretty much treaded the same ground as Crest of a Knave, while Catfish Rising found them bringing back their folk and blues roots, but the problem was that album could have been a lot better than it actually was (for example, I could live without \\"Doctor to my Disease\\" and \\"Still Loving You Tonight\\"). Then there was the 1992 live album A Little Light Music, which was more or less the Tull version of Unplugged, released around the same time Eric Clapton released his Unplugged, but of course, the Tull album was not recorded anywhere near MTV or its Unplugged program, so the album couldn't be called Unplugged. The album was largely acoustic (even Dave Pegg used an acoustic bass guitar), half them instrumental versions (demonstrating that Ian Anderson didn't have the voice he used to prior to Crest of a Knave).    But I was really surprised with Roots to Branches, the 1995 studio followup to Catfish Rising, I really think this is their best album since the late '70s! The music really took a giant step over its predecessor, many cuts harkening to their earlier sound, but of course there's still that mellow sound that permeates the more recent Tull. Some Middle Eastern influences are starting to pop up, but it's not in huge amounts, the best example being \\"Rare and Precious Chain\\". I never imagining Tull exploring Middle Eastern styles before, but they did it quite well here. I really also enjoy \\"Valley\\" and \\"Beside Myself\\". Many of the other songs have some rather progressive arrangements, like \\"At Last, Forever\\", and \\"Wounded, Old and Treacherous\\", meaning the progheads who might have given up on Tull by the 1980s might want to consider Roots to Branches. \\"Stuck in the August Rain\\" doesn't sound too far from something off Minstrel in the Gallery. Many of the songs also have orchestrations that sound like something David Palmer would do, unfortunately no mention of who conducted the orchestra, and for all I know, it was simply digital facsimiles from a synthesizer from Andrew Giddings.    I notice Dave Pegg only played on three cuts (I guess he was also busy with Fairport Convention, which, if I'm not mistakened, also had a new CD out around the same time), Steve Bailey handled the rest. Also, Pegg left for good after this album, replaced by Jonathan Noyce (who was born in 1971, which meant he was born the same year as Aqualung, and also meaning the group now had band members that were a generation apart in age difference).    Roots to Branches is certainly a breath of fresh air for me, the drums are real, real instruments, plenty of great flute playing (even more so, when Ian Anderson decided it would be better to emphasize his flute playing after he developed throat problams back in the mid '80s), and synthesizers  that don't take over. This is certainly the finest Tull album they done in recent times, I was totally amazed. Tull fans will need this CD, even those who gave up on them long ago.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This CD soundtrack of the movie Chicago gives us great music written by Kander and Ebb. The musical arrangements are masterfully written and executed; and the lyrics to each song are clever, too. The overall effect is a fun CD to listen to--even if you haven't seen the film! Some of the bonus material is very different from the Kander and Ebb style and depending on your tastes you may like this or not.<br /><br />The CD starts out with the overture and goes straight into the first song \\"And All That Jazz\\" sung by Catherine Zeta-Jones with an awesome chorus backing her up. Ren&eacute;e Zellweger sings a line or two in this number; but this is Catherine's first opportunity to shine and she doesn't waste it. Indeed, there's hardly a loser in the bunch on this CD--the Kander and Ebb songs are singularly beautiful and sensitively performed by Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, Richard Gere, John C. Reilly, and Queen Latifah. What a great cast to sing these songs!<br /><br />It's tough for me to pick out just one song as my favorite on this CD. John C. Reilly, as another reviewer points out, does a masterful job of singing \\"Mister Cellophane\\" with all the pizzazz of a classic vaudeville number that tugs at your heartstrings because his character is that pitiful. Queen Latifah performs brilliantly when she sings \\"When You're Good To Mama;\\" her voice is vibrant, rich and electric! Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger do flawless work with \\"I Can't Do It Alone\\" and \\"Roxie\\" respectively.<br /><br />The CD boasts some interesting extras, too. There's the song \\"Class\\" performed by Queen Latifah and Catherine Zeta-Jones; this song was cut from the film. I understand why this song was cut because it just doesn't have the same sharp and snazzy feel to it as the other songs that did make it into the actual film.<br /><br />In addition, there are two tracks written and produced by Danny Elfman: \\"After Midnight\\" and \\"Roxie's Suite.\\" Both of these tracks have that 1920s/1930s jazz feel to them and they are very nice bonuses.<br /><br />The two last tracks promise to be controversial because the rap version of \\"Cell Block Tango\\" just doesn't fit into this score. \\"Cell Block Tango\\" is performed by Queen Latifah along with Macy Gray and Lil' Kim. The other song up for debate is the final track on this album entitled \\"Love Is A Crime\\" by Anastacia. It has a pop/R&B flavor to it that again does not fit into the soundtrack score. These two songs are so different from the rest of the CD that you'll either like them or hate them. I thought the rap version of \\"Cell Block Tango\\" was about average in quality; but I did like Anastacia's \\"Love Is A Crime.\\" I leave it up to the individual listener to judge for themselves. There is no absolute right or wrong response to these songs; it's all about personal taste.<br /><br />The liner notes that came with the CD (as of when I purchased this three years ago) offer song credits and lyrics along with great color pictures from the film. Tim Pinckney contributes a fine essay about the history of the show both on stage and screen.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this CD for fans of movie soundtracks, fans of the great Kander and Ebb songwriting team and people who enjoyed the movie and want to remember it by listening to the soundtrack on CD. Kander and Ebb worked hard to produce an outstanding score for this film and this CD proves it.o them and they are very nice bonuses.  <br /> <br />The two last tracks promise to be controversial because the rap version of \\"Cell Block Tango\\" just doesn't fit into this score. \\"Cell Block Tango\\" is performed by Queen Latifah along with Macy Gray and Lil' Kim.

B000001ELR|3.0|As a classic KISS fan, \\"Creatures of the Night\\" was a very difficult time for me. Peter had not been on a KISS album since \\"Dynasty,\\" and now Ace, my favorite, was gone. I immediately wondered on buying the album why Ace did not have a lead vocal track, or the usual extensive song writing credits. Of course, it's now well known while Ace's mug is on the cover, Ace not only did not sing on the album, but he didn't even play guitar. Ace would not be on stage, either, as the Creatures/10th Anniversary tour hit the road, having now been replaced with the goofy-looking, wang-bar addicted Vinnie Vincent. I saw the tour in Dallas, TX, and Shreveport, LA, and was really irritated Vincent ignored Ace's excellent past guitar work and did his own thing. Dive bombs instead of the brilliant solo in \\"Calling Dr. Love?\\" <br /> <br />Many sing this album's praises, but it actually is probably my least favorite original makeup-era album. I know, how can I say that given the prior offering \\"Music from the Elder?\\"  Maybe it was the repeated deception of putting members on the cover that weren't on the album, and Ace was the last straw. But I honestly think it's just the material. The band gets huge props for rocking on this one, ironically what Ace wanted to do before they started \\"The Elder\\" recordings. Eric Carr is a monster on drums and sounds superb. Some killer guitar tones and riffs, but I don't see how some can say Ace is not missed on the record. But while the album does rock and sounds great from a production standpoint, I think the songwriting is sorely lacking. And the heavy style just sometimes seems too forced at times. While the concept album \\"The Elder\\" was bizarre musically, the idea was really not bad for a band that wears makeup and costumes. Maybe I'm just biased and KISS without Ace Frehley to me is just not KISS.   <br /> <br />The album opens with the excellent title track, by far my favorite song on the album. When I do KISS \\"mix\\" recordings, this is the only track from the album I ever include. \\"I Love It Loud\\" and \\"War Machine\\" are great songs for the Gene persona and work very well live, but aren't very good stand-alone tunes. (Although Stone Temple Pilots thought enough of \\"War Machine\\" to convert it to \\"Sex Type Thing.\\") \\"I Still Love You\\" has some incredible drum work from Eric, but the chorus just gets monotonous, even with the usual outstanding vocal performance from Paul. Every other tune is to me forgettable, as KISS moves into the harder, more modern sound for the 80's, setting up the even worse \\"non-makeup\\" albums to come. Some great tunes here and there are in store (\\"Tears Are Falling\\"), but the band would not have a solid album again until 1992's \\"Revenge.\\"  <br /> <br />I think KISS fans rate this record high for the simple fact it returned to hard rock and good production after \\"The Elder\\" disaster. But while the songs do rock, they are for the most part generic and highly forgettable. Again, I'll take \\"Creatures\\" over any non-makeup album save \\"Revenge,\\" but the record stumbles more than their departed lead guitar player.  <br />
B000F39M9W|5.0|Esa-Pekka Salonen has become one of the foremost conductors of Stravinsky's masterpiece 'Le Sacre du printemps' and finally there is a recording to match the brilliance he reveals in this score. This astonishingly superb CD is the first recording made in the perfect acoustic of the Walt Disney Hall in Los Angeles, the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.  While no recording can capture the otherworldly magic of sitting in this hall surrounded with the most perfect sonics ever granted an orchestra by an architect, an acoustician, and the power of the premiere orchestra under the baton of Salonen, this recording comes as close as possible!<br /><br />Salonen opens this 'concert' with Mussorgsky's original 'Night on Bald Mountain' - a sophisticated work not at all like the Disney Fantasia version.  For those who are hearing this work in its original form for the first time the power of the effect may seem diminished, but repeated exposure allows hearing the inner lines of this very well orchestrated work.  What follows is Bela Bartok's 'The Miraculous Mandarin', a work too seldom performed.  It is rich in echoes of 'Bluebeard's Castle' and is a moody masterwork of extremes in dynamics and in tempi.  The sonics from the hall capture all of the delicacies (solo desk contributions are amazingly clear) and satire of this rich score.<br /><br />But of course the raison d'etre for this first recording session is the Le Sacre du printemps and here Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic give the most sensitively detailed, propulsive, earthy, exhilarating performance on record.  Le Sacre comes from within the brilliant mind and soul of Esa-Pekka Salonen and what he achieves is uncanny and right.  The piece is now so familiar that comparisons come quickly, but few will be able to resist applauding not only the extraordinary sound here but also the profoundly moving performance.  Salonen gives it his all and the orchestra 'sounds' like the premiere ensemble it has become.  This is a landmark recording that belongs in the library of every lover of classical music.  It is breathtaking!  Grady Harp, October 06This is a landmark recording that belongs in the library of every lover of classical music.  It is breathtaking!  Grady Harp, October 06
B000084T18|5.0|Now I know haters will be upset, but you can't deny 50's talent. This may not be a perfect cd, but with so many bangers, great beats, and catchy hooks, what better way to start off your career. So my hats off to 50 on a great debut.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Tim Burton offers the most charmingly off-beat yet visually sumptuous movies in Hollywood.  From his stop-animation work (\\"The Corpse Bride\\") to dark romances (\\"Edward Scissorhands\\") to horror (\\"Sleepy Hollow\\"), Burton never fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm just a bit uncomfortably - all the right notes are there, but some are played just off-key enough to create the thrill of tension. <br /> <br />Perhaps no other director was so suited to film Roald Dahl's most famous work, \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" and remain true to the author's vision.  Most people associate the tamer, goofy \\"Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\\" starring Gene Wilder, with Dahl's tale, but forget that Dahl had a healthy streak of Lemony Snicket sensibility to him.  So it is perfect that Burton makes a darker, more dangerous film for all to enjoy. <br /> <br />The visuals in \\"Charlie\\" are astounding.  The chocolate waterfall and river look like actual liquid chocolate (not the icky brown water of \\"Willie Wonka\\"), and the squirrel-nut-sorting room is a classic of mind-blowing set design.  And that is not all - oh, no, that is not all! <br /> <br />Possibly the most visually stunning element in \\"Charlie\\" is Willie Wonka himself, played by Burton favorite Johnny Depp.  Depp sinks so deep into his roles that he becomes one with them, and one wonders what inspired Depp's quirky, nervous, mean-spirited, selfish concoction.  Depp plays Wonka as tight as he plays Jack Sparrow loose, and he never misses a note. But whereas Gene Wilder's Willie Wonka was more genial puppetmaster, Depp's Wonka has a sadistic streak in him, perhaps instilled by his dentist father.  This is a great, if much-maligned, performance. <br /> <br />The most infamous element from the first movie was the seemingly-drug-inspired presence of the Oompa-Loompas, Wonka's army of diminutive henchmen.  In the Wilder film, the Oompa-Loompas were dwarfs given to sophomoric dance numbers to the irritatingly catchy \\"oompa-loompa-do-be-de-do\\" tune.  In this version, all the Oompa-Loompas are played by the same character (even though there are hundreds of them), and their dance numbers are even more fantastic.  However, the songs don't have quite the same sharp punch as the original songs, which pointed out the various failings of the kids and their parents as they got eliminated from the contest. Indeed, there are several lyrics that I just couldn't catch in this film version, and that is a pretty major quibble. <br /> <br />Far from a feel-good movie, but definitely a good movie, \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" deserves to be seen and, for fans of artistic visions, studied.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is easily my favorite Eminem cd. He brought great lyricism to the table, along with excellant production. And besides who doesnt get their adrenaline pumping when they hear \\"KIM\\". Then you got classic sounding Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg on \\"Bitch Please II\\", which makes this cd an instant classic. Great job Em.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel is one of the best to come out of Hollywood.<br /><br />Austen's novel begins with, \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\"  In Pride and Prejudice Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) supplies the prejudice.  The pride comes from Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) who finds Elizabeth attractive and intelligent but beneath him.  Miss Bennet finds Mr. Darcy a snob.  Both play their parts well.<br /><br />However, Jane Austen novels are set at a slower time and written for people who had the time to read them.  They are leisurely affairs to be read over days.  Therefore, no movie of 129 minutes can adequately capture the depth of her genius.  That is why I have always enjoyed the A&E/BBC miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  While the miniseries did not have the budget of the movie, it had time, 300 minutes, to develop the plot.  Although the opening scene in the miniseries is not in Austen's novel, whole pages of text are presented verbatim.<br /><br />Another strength of the movie is the excellent cinematography.  The sets and scenes are exquisitely shot.  However, the movie has been criticized for making the Bennet family appear lower in class.  We are never sure from the novel exactly what Mr. Darcy found objectionable with the Bennet family.  I would say that the movie portrays the difference in class between the two families well.  Demonstrating this class difference might even be a weakness of the miniseries.  I am not bothered by the modernization of the dialogue, this helps the modern audience enjoy the movie, but what does bother me is the modernization of etiquette and morals.  Men and women of the time did not casually allow visitors in their bedrooms or when they were only partially dressed.<br /><br />I enjoy and study Regency and Victorian literature and have seen every Austen movie ever made and read her books.  I have both this movie and the miniseries in my collection and enjoy them both.  I have rated the movie four-stars in comparison to the A&E/BBC miniseries.  For fans of Jane Austen, both are well worth watching.<br /><br />Kyle Prattoth this movie and the miniseries in my collection and enjoy them both.

0765315246|5.0|On his 75th birthday John Perry visited the grave of his wife and enlisted in the Army. This is one hell of a opening premise for a novel. This itself raises all sorts of questions about the nature of the story and the world behind the story. What sort of an army is this that would accept a 75 year old man? Why would a 75 year old man think about joining the army? What sort of world / universe is this that such a situation is even possible? What's going on?! The hook, well, hooked me. This is John Scalzi's debut novel and it is a doozy. I can see the cover blurb now \\"Old Man's War a doozy. - some reader\\" But really, how best to get my excitement for this book across without using the usual tired cliches that come up? A real page turner? Yep. A wild ride? That too. A modern science fiction masterpiece? A bit presumptuous perhaps, but the book was on the Hugo shortlist and managed to thrill and excite me for old men in space far more than Clint Eastwood's movie Space Cowboys did. How's that for a recommendation? \\"Better than Space Cowboys! - some guy\\"<br /><br />Okay. Here's the story: The novel is set on future Earth where Humankind has been colonizing the Universe. The Colonials have pretty well kept the rest of Earth stuck on the planet except for those who are willing to volunteer for the Colonial Army. The mortality rate is very, very high and the service is for a minimum of two years up to a maximum of ten years at the discretion of the Colonial Army. Those who survive will be given a new life and a homestead on a colony. This is the only way off Earth and into the Universe at Large. The Colonials are battling a variety of alien races for planets to colonize. Scalzi gives us an impressive variety of alien life. Very creative. Back to the plot description: The Colonial Army will only take men and women from America at the age of 75. The Earthbound senior citizens assume they will be made young, though nobody knows how. How else would a 75 year old be able to fight?<br /><br />The reality is far different than they or the reader could expect. The story is far more thrilling than I anticipated. There is part Full Metal Jacket with the training and part just military science fiction told with appropriate humor for the situations. John Scalzi introduces the reader to a novel and a world far greater than the slim 300 pages would suggest. There is storytelling and narrative depth here, though the story moves along very fast.<br /><br />Few novels make me sit up and say \\"Damn!\\" but Old Man's War did and Scalzi does simply an excellent job here to write fun, exciting, memorable science fiction that is nowhere near as dense as the work of Peter F Hamilton (and I like Hamilton, don't get me wrong). This is accessible science fiction that is a true joy to read.<br /><br />There.

B000HCO83Q|5.0|I can't disagree more with the bad reviews people have written here about X-Men \\"The Last Stand\\", which is IMO the most exciting,and entertaining movie I have ever seen in years!.The cast, the special effects, the story, the action scenes,and everyhting else seems to work to make this the best of the X-Men Trilogy( I also liked the first two).I guess some reviewers are simply blind or have to hate X-Men to say the movie was boring, disappointing, or bad.I have seen lots of movies this year, but nothing compares and comes close to \\"The Last Stand\\".Although box office numbers are really good for this movie,X-Men \\"The Last Stand\\" should have attracted more people than the movies about pirates and cars.It is not fair.I am not a film critic or an expert ,and I am not an X-Men fan, either.I am only a moviegoer who is after good entertainment and X-Men \\"The Last Stand\\" is definitely the action movie of the year!!!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000HIVO64|5.0|Beck has created a catchy lush masterpiece that dives into introspection without taking you under. Observing his lyrics as if from afar you can't help but feel the power of his almost elusive poetry.<br /><br />Otherworldly textures make this album exciting and listening to this on the right headphones (I can hear the lyrics better on AKG headphones) makes \\"We Dance Alone.\\" positively heart stopping. \\"The Information\\" is the catchiest song with primal beats and ecstatic sighs.<br /><br />1000 BPM is highly complex even if you look up the lyrics. It seems you can either decide to analyze the lyrics of just enjoy the electronic texture ride. \\"Movie Theme\\" has more warmth and mellows out the album at the end like a dreamy soul daze.<br /><br />In the end, I think I'm in love with the way his voice navigates the poetry and plays with sensuality within technology. The lyrics tease and taunt the listener in the most intriguing ways and you are left blissfully mystified in places and enlightened in others where recognition dawns. I still love \\"Sea Change\\" for the acoustic elements, but this is stunning in its edgy electronic elation.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000FL7CAK|1.0|I enjoyed the first season of Veronica Mars immensely, and was looking very much forward to season two.  But the lack of English subtitles has prevented me from watching the season even though I bought it.  As a non-native English speaker, I very often need to rely on the subtitles to follow the snappy dialogue, and while every tv series I ever bought to this point has had them they're apparently disappearing (missed them on the new Gilmore Girls dvd set as well).  The choice is now limited to French or Spanish, neither of which I understand.  Please, please put the English subtitles back in!
B00006G8K0|5.0|This is a film which is of the type that is beyond criticism. Ideal viewing for Friday the 13th October. If you wanted to be picky, you could say that it creaks a little. Nevertheless, it also flows. Straightforward in style, it is extremely effective: much more so than the later attempts with their contorted struggles to extract extra sensation. Lee and Cushing are what they are: definitive Dracula and van Helsing. Perfect casting. The atmosphere is spot on. Victorian Gothic, where the slowness of some sections merely increases the dramatic power when Dracula gets into his stride, all glowing eyes and dripping fangs. The female victims are somehow aptly overripe, just ready for a depraved roll in the bedclothes with a smouldering sex-fiend and blood-sucker. Perfect candidates for addiction. Although Harker and the Holmwoods have English names, none of this takes place in England: note that, Sean! The innkeeper sells Gordon's Gin, but otherwise he's sort of Sussex Ruritanian. And so is the undertaker/mortician; dear old Miles Malleson. Well, we mustn't be too precise about exactly where this is happening --- it's all in the mind. Once I was out shopping with my young son, when suddenly I saw Christopher Lee, stalking head and shoulders above the other shoppers. Look! I said to my boy, there's Dracula! A terrific frisson shot through the crowd. This was in Harrods, London.
B000GKHM2S|5.0|A truely fantastic film from a truely awsome Who album! The film depicts 1964, when the two rival youth movements were very much present. On one side you had the traditional Rockers with their big bikes & leathers & on the other, the new kid on the block - The Mod (Modernist). 1964 was a fantastic time in England with London being a mecca for all things Mod. Quadrophenia takes us on a 60's trip through London & the south coast resort of Brighton. It tells the story of Jimmy (The Mod)& his aspirations for all thing Mod, only to conclude that things ain't all they suppose to be. A great cast is brought together under the watchful eye of Franc Roddam. All works well on this movie, the young cast, the director & lets not forget the thumping sounds of the Who with a nice blend of 60's sounds to back the picture up. It's quality at it's best. It's English & it was made at a time when the British film industry was truely suffering, (as it still does). We do pride ourselves on our films & Quadrophenia does us more than Proud - with a capitol 'P' .
B000FTWB7G|5.0|At first, I wasn't so sure about the album...like Tool's 10,000 days initially it seemed to be just different enough from what I knew that I wasn't sure it was as good as what had come before.  After giving it a few spins in the CD player though I found the songs playing themselves through my head all day.  Much like 10,000 days I now find myself listening to the CD and rarely if ever skipping a track (and that is usually when one of the songs is in my head and I have to hear it). <br /> <br />I really appreciate that Evanescence didn't just copy the \\"feel\\" of Fallen and create a sequel clone that would have felt stale, epically with how many times their songs were played on the radio and in the CD/MP3/whatever players of fans around the world.  <br /> <br />At first, it feels kind of odd, like seeing an old friend for the first time in years, but given just a little time to catch up you'll find that much of what you loved is still there.
0316172324|4.0|I found the book very readable and highly entertaining where Malcolm Gladwell illustrates his point with many real life examples from the past. <br /> <br />I am highly convinced with the presence and working of our subconscious (this point has also being published and argued by many other authors). <br /> <br />Readers would be highly engrossed by experiments that enable one to tell how long a marriage would last, the effects of Pepsi and Coke tests, the autistic blindness that occurs when we were under extreme stress and many others. <br /> <br />However, I do not find any useful methods or means whereby we could control and command this subsciousness to maximise its usefulness in our daily life. Maybe at this point in time, it is still an unknown universe.
B000002LND|4.0|This is a greatest hits collection defining the first 7 years of Madonna's career (1983-1990) that established her as the most successful and influential female pop-rock artist of all times. The first three singles \\"Holiday\\", \\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Borderline\\" are from her debut album Madonna (1983). It was really the title track from the album \\"Like A Virgin\\" that gave Madonna the breakthrough. She defined her image as the liberal young woman who was not afraid of or ashamed of her sexuality. an image that continues to influence females' artists even today (Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Nelly Furtado, Gwen Stefani, Shakira, and many others). It was really Madonna that created the \\"sexy, liberal young woman image\\" for all her successors to follow. \\"Like A Virgin\\" was followed by \\"Material Girl\\", where Madonna boldly states the nature of the modern world and how she openly declares she shares the very same nature.<br /><br />Over the years, Madonna became more daring and controversial, not just with her lyrics, but with her videos and concerts. Her star-power and success grew stronger and stronger with every new release. I think one of the most important Madonna albums is \\"True Blue\\" (1986) as it gave her three back-to-back #1 hits, \\"Live To Tell\\", \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" and \\"Open Your Heart\\" and also a top-5 hit, \\"La Isla Bonita\\" all of which are included in this CD. When Madonna released her 4th studio album, \\"Like A Prayer\\", she was already the biggest female pop artist of her generation. The title track \\"Like A Prayer\\" quickly became number one hit single (making Madonna the female artist with the most #1 hits in the history). And the video for the song fueled more controversy. The last three songs on the CD are from the early 90s and you can feel a change in her sound. Her sound has changed but Madonna's image has remained the same in the years to follow.<br /><br />This is a very good collection but it is far from being immaculate because it misses quite a few major Madonna hits such as \\"Dress You Up\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"True Blue\\" and two major hits from the \\"Who's That Girl?\\" soundtrack, the title track and \\"Causing a Commotion\\" as well as a top-ten single from Dick Tracy soundtrack, \\"Hanky Panky\\". Yet, until recently this was the only greatest hits collection  she had released. Now she has [...] Greatest Hits - Volume 2. [...] making this the \\"Volume 1\\" of the series. What we really need is a 2-3 cd (or even better: a box set) collection of Madonna's hits because she has just way too many to fit in one or even two cd.e a few major Madonna hits such as \\"Dress You Up\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"True Blue\\" and two major hits from the \\"Who's That Girl?\\" soundtrack, the title track and \\"Causing a Commotion\\" as well as a top-ten single from Dick Tracy soundtrack, \\"Hanky Panky\\".

B000CNFC76|5.0|While I am not a golfer, I am a sports fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Due to my lack of knowledge of the history of the sport, I had never heard of any of these golfers, but that didn't matter because the golf scenes are suspenseful and the movie is about much more than just the sport. Golf serves as a metaphor for class differences as they were manifested at the turn of the early twentieth century.    The parallel between British golf pro and champion Harry Vardon and American amateur Francis Ouimet is deftly drawn. Vardon's poor family was forced off of its land for the sake of a golf course when he was a child, and he was told that \\"Golf is a game played by gentlemen; not for the likes of you.\\" The term gentleman in this era, as we come to see (and in case we didn't already know), has nothing to do with manners but with how much money a man has. Vardon becomes the most successful golfer of his time, but he is still treated much like a lackey by the country club set who, although they like the idea of how his success might rub some fame off on them, can't quite bring themselves to fully include him in their circles (although they attempt to force themselves to forget his roots because they are so enamored of his fame).    Francis Ouimet, on the other hand, faces his class challenge at home. America is the land of opportunity in which he should be free to chase his dream, even if the dream is that of becoming a pro golfer. His major obstacle, besides money, is his father who thinks it is foolish for Francis to try to rise above his station in life. The way Francis is treated by the country club set seems to confirm his father's notions, but there are people who are willing to help Francis because they see the talent that he possesses and know that he could become successful on the golf circuit. Vardon himself comes to appreciate Ouimet and his talent, and we know it is because he sees the similarities between the two of them.    This leads to the classicunderdog-overcomes-many-obstacles-to-success story which we all know and love so much. Disney studios has released some of the best films in this genre in recent years with \\"Remember the Titans,\\" \\"The Rookie,\\" \\"Miracle,\\" \\"Glory Road,\\" and this film. My only concern is that they are running out of sports about which they can make another such movie. I highly recommend \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" as well as the other films just mentioned. If Disney ever makes another one of these great films and gets it down to zero curse words, then they will have absolutely perfected the genre (although, in fairness, there are only a very few curse words in any of these films; however, the presence of any at all causes some dismay for the family audience which these films are intended to reach).
B000H5TH1Q|4.0|In the early 1980s, Brian De Palma made two movies about obsessed voyeurs with Blow Out and then Body Double. With its perceived misogynistic views of women exacerbated by the violence depicted towards them and the ample use of nudity, the film became a lightning rod for controversy when it was initially released. This new Special Edition is a double-dip for this title with brand new extras and new interviews conducted with cast and crew made specifically for this release.<br /><br />Throughout his career, De Palma has been dogged with the criticism that he blatantly rips off the films of Alfred Hitchcock. And to be fair, there are several overt references in Body Double. Like Jimmy Stewart's character in Vertigo, Jake has a debilitating fear that affects him at the worst possible moments. He also ends up remaking a woman into an idealized version of one he was obsessed with previously, much as Stewart does with Kim Novak's character in Vertigo. And like Stewart's character in Rear Window, Jake witnesses a crime being committed from afar and is powerless to stop it.<br /><br />Body Double shows the ugly, moral tawdriness of the bottom rungs of the Los Angeles acting scene. When we first meet Jake he's in danger of being fired from Z-grade horror film. De Palma has crafted a beautifully structured thriller with a mystery that we piece together along with Jake.<br /><br />\\"The Seduction\\" examines the origins of the film. De Palma got the idea for it while working on Dressed to Kill and originally set it in New York City but he spent a lot of time in L.A. while making Scarface.<br /><br />In \\"The Setup\\" De Palma explains that the premise of Body Double is a postmodern spin on Hitchcock, specifically Vertigo. He also talks about the notion of voyeurism and how he called attention to it repeatedly.<br /><br />\\"The Mystery.\\" The porn music video was inspired by De Palma watching countless hours of MTV. A colleague recommended using the song \\"Relax\\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood who, as it turned out, were big fans of the director.<br /><br />Finally, there is \\"The Controversy\\" which examines the critical savaging Body Double received when it came out, claiming that it portrayed women negatively and that it was too violent.es to Hollywood who, as it turned out, were big fans of the director. <br /> <br />Finally, there is \\"The Controversy\\" which examines the critical savaging Body Double received when it came out, claiming that it portrayed women negatively and that it was too violent.
B000002N2Z|5.0|This big-label debut from a Sacramento-based Deftones always takes me ten years back, when I went to high school. But despite that, the album still sounds very original, and unfortunately for the music industry - very unlike the stuff you hear today. Their style is impossible to describe, because all descriptions fall short of actually hearing the band. Combining the emotional openness of pop, the teen rage of punk, and the street-smart culture of hip-hop, the Deftones painted a perfect soundscape for the bored youth of sunny suburban wastelands. Chino Moreno masterfully navigates his voice through a range emotions of a growing soul - from innocent love to dark fantasies, from hope to despair, from vulnerability to cruelty. Angelic soft whispers mutate into demonic screams, and hip-hop-influenced verses give way to Depeche Mode-like melodic choruses. <br /> <br />Musically Deftones sound quite hard, but not in a boring kind of way. Their music is fun, groovy, and has a great sense of beat. Bassist Chi plays creative, almost jazz-like lines, Abe Cunningham provides effective drums, while Steve Carpenter very masterfully blasts with simple but loud and chilling riffs. DJ Frank Delgado enhances the sound with sparse atmospheric effects and scratches. The whole band sound is really an attempt to unite a variety of cultural influences so common in the California Central Valley, and it pays off very well. The production could be more refined, but at the same time the roughness adds more fun to the first public effort.
B000002MU3|4.0|This CD is much more raunchy than their earlier stuff, but it is a must have.  It shows a time when R.E.M. was once again rebelling against the tried and true (and safe) songs of some their earlier releases. <br />I have every R.E.M. CD and this one is a must have if you are a fan.

Try the remix album of \\"Tapis Rouge Solarium\\".

B0002BO0AS|5.0|Unearth is a metalcore quintet that hails from Boston, MA. In 2004, they released their sophomore album, \\"The Oncoming Storm.\\" This album is among the best I've heard in the genre, and from start to finish, it never fails to deliver a powerful combination of Mike Justian's brutal drums, Trevor Phipp's pissed and passionate vocals, and thunderous (excuse the pun) breakdowns that break down walls alongside the band's disgusted, relentless politically- and religiously-influenced lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"The Great Dividers\\" begins the album by criticizing the American government's foreign policy, international appearance and structure. It begins and ends with a very quick pace that leads perfectly into \\"Failure.\\" This is a religiously-charged song that looks down on the guilt and fear spread through the church. It criticizes those who blindly follow the church. Like many other Unearth songs, it ends in a fist-pumping fashion with the repetition of, \\"Die my child!\\" in reference to Jesus Christ. \\"This Lying World\\" begins with a beckoning guitar riff that leads into a much darker, lower tone. This song features one of the more pronounced breakdowns on \\"Oncoming Storm.\\" It's a song that, like \\"Great Dividers,\\" shows negativity in the political realm; mostly about international affairs and the lies and \\"iron fist\\" of the Bush Administration. \\"Steel toed, this path of corruption/Conceal and steer our minds away.\\" <br /> <br />One of the easiest songs on the album to interpret, \\"Black Hearts Now Reign\\" pounds negativity towards the pillaging of natural resources throughout the world for wealth and power: \\"Rob this world of resource/Burn the oil for fortune/Stealing from our savior/In quest for power/Sealed, our fate is catastrophic/The coming days of failure/Aborting evolution/In quest of power.\\" This song's outroduction plays right into the introduction of \\"Zombie Autopilot.\\" Possibly the best song on \\"Oncoming Storm,\\" \\"Zombie Autopilot\\" begins with a powerful thrash introduction and features a blistering solo just over midway through the song. The solo then leads into the brutal, powerful vocals that then fade into a softer, almost desparate ending with the vocalist repeating, \\"Free us a piece of mind/Gone are the dreamers/Who strive to know,\\" followed by \\"All of us are blind.\\" This song shows a lack of hope in the future, where human beings will show little improvement or change to their mechanical lives. \\"Bloodlust Of The Human Condition\\" is one of the most powerful songs on the album. It is very much against war and worldwide violence, almost seeming to blame ourselves for those two travesties. \\"We feed this hunger for horror/Cold is the human heart/Is the human mind.\\" This song is one of the many Unearth songs that picks up and drops off its tempo throughout several parts of the song, giving it a lot of energy. <br /> <br />\\"Lies to Purify\\" begins with a low-key, fast-paced riff that makes an excellent return near the end of the song. My interpretation of this song is that it's directed towards George W. Bush, saying, \\"You're crossing almost every line/Now it's time to wash away/You lost your way/You crossed the line/You crossed every line.\\" \\"Endless\\" is another song about about the disgust towards the government and violence. \\"Endless fight/Endless tragedy/Endless lunacy.\\" \\"Endless\\" has some of Justian's best drumming. A beautiful, mostly-instrumental interlude, \\"Aries\\" still manages to throw in background lyrics with anti-violence messages. \\"Cowardly warrior vents his rage/His lust for blood cannot be appeased/What fickle angels are we/Our divided brothers we slay/His lust will erase all.\\" <br /> <br />Another personal favorite song on \\"Oncoming Storm,\\" \\"Predetermined Sky\\" features the most brutal and unrelenting riffs and the same crushing drum work.  It also contains the same doomed message that most of \\"Oncoming Storm's\\" songs are filled with. Near the end of the song, there is a break in the action that leads to a vicious guitarriff and outroduction. Finally, ending the album, is another song whose title describes its meaning quite well. \\"False Idols\\" shows a pretty negative feeling towards the world's different religions. \\"Who stands before us/As we speak we lay our lives down for the star/It's all pathetically the same.\\" It's not the strongest ending track, but it's not a bad song, either. <br /> <br />All-in-all, \\"Oncoming Storm\\" isn't a perfect album--the political message grows to be a little tiring, and the metalcore genre in general is definitely lacking innovation, but at no point throughout the disc does the music lose its power and feeling. I personally don't care how innovative the sound or the genre is; I haven't had this much fun listening to music in quite a while. If you've missed out on \\"Oncoming Storm,\\" I'd recommend giving it a listen--it's a fanstatic album in almost every way.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I really think Boston did to good a job on their debut. This album was so good that they could never really compete with it. This album is just amazing. It's hard to put into words how good it really is. There are no weak spots at all. Every song is a classic and just rocks. This has to be up on the list of best debut albums of all time. Must have for anyone who likes classic rock.
0618551050|5.0|This is a superb, five star, technical book. Smolin starts by describing the five, big, unsolved problems of physics. Then proceeds to a wide ranging overview of the last three decades of theoretical and experimental work, assessing how much (if any) progress has been made toward answering the five big problems. String theory from this perspective gets a failing grade. Smolin's writing is always clear and lucid, providing non-physicists with at least a modicum of understanding of complex issues. If you have any interest in modern physics, I urge you to read this book. <br /> <br />For the benefit of readers I want to point out a small, but troublesome, error in chapter 13 on the cosmological constant scale, R.  In this chapter Smolin points out that a possible alternative to dark matter as an explanation for flat galaxy velocity profiles is a modification of Newton's law of gravity below an acceleration threshold (1.2 x 10^-8 cm/sec^2). This acceleration threshold he says is suggestively close to c^2/R, but he does not give the actual number comparison. So I worked it out using Smolin's value for R given on page 204 as \\"about 10 billion light-years, or 10^27 cm\\".  I found a two order of magnitude difference, not that close, I  thought. <br /> <br />I soon found the reason the comparison was so poor. Smolin and his editors at Houghton Mifflin don't seem to know how many cm there are in a 10 billion light-years. 10 billion light years is 10^28 cm, not 10^27 cm. Here is the calculation: 1 light year = 3.6x10^3 sec/hr x 2.4x10^1 hr/day x 3.6525x10^2 day/yr x 3x10^8 m/sec (speed of light) = 9.47x10^15 m/yr. So 10 billion light years (in cm) is 9.47x10^15 m/yr x 10^10 yr x 10^2 cm/m = 9.47x10^27 cm, which rounds to 10^28 cm.   <br /> <br /> <br />
0393327655|5.0|As an individual who has believed in the institution of the church through sixty-four of my sixty-six years on this earth, I found The End Of Faith most refreshing and well reasoned.   <br /> <br />A number of events confluenced to wake me up to the foolishness of religious belief itself, and to the danger posed by religion in the world today.  These included my own church's un-Christ like reaction to the priest abuse scandals, the similar close-minded beliefs of devoted Muslim and Christian fundamentalists (yet they both cannot be right), and a review of the horrors wrought by religion on mankind, both today and throughout history. <br /> <br />I found Sam Harris' reasoning to mirror my own, strengthening and extending my thinking on the shallow foundation existing for much of the \\"morality\\" preached today, as compared to the peacefulness of living one's life in a self-realized and truer set of rights and wrongs. <br /> <br />I feel that The End Of Faith is a convincing wake up call to any freethinking person.  I have experienced in Sam Harris' paragraphs simple and undeniable truths, and have now purchased or shared his books with a number of my associates and family members - so to encourage their own evolution toward reality.

How do you find a thing you have mislaid or forgotton? You keep it in your mind until you recall it. The sense of being, of 'I am' is the first to emerge.

B00005JT6F|5.0|Not to be confused with America's \\"Definitive Pop Collection\\" 2 CD set, this collection was released internationally about the same time as America's \\"Complete Greatest Hits\\" was released in the US.  This collection is intended for the international market, while \\"Complete Greatest Hits\\" targets the US market.  While both collections are excellent and there is a lot of overlap between the two CDs, this one omits a few songs that were minor hits in the US and adds several songs that failed to chart in the US but were hits in other countries (such as \\"Survival\\" and \\"The Last Unicorn\\" which were hits in Europe).  The sound quality and packaging are great.  It includes nice liner notes and the music is great.  There is one notable omission from this collection.  The song \\"From a Moving Train\\" was a number 1 hit in Spain and was a minor hit on the AC charts in the US in 1998 but is not included on any America collection.  Apparently Rhino was unable to acquire the rights for the song (those who wish to have the song will just have to purchase America's \\"Human Nature\\" CD).<br /><br />While this is certainly an excellent collection, US fans might be more satisfied with \\"Complete Greatest Hits\\" (in addition to saving a few bucks).

B000ETRCMQ|5.0|I highly recommend \\"Transameria\\" as a very good movie, about a human being seeking to be true to herself, which is a universal theme, as well as being a breakthrough film about transsexuals. As a person who believes there should be greater tolerance among humanity, I enjoyed the film.  Hopefully this movie will help increase wider public acceptance of transgendered persons, especially transssexuals, in the United States and elsewhere.       I thought Felicity Huffman, played a generally credible pre-operative male to female transsexual. I was a little concerned Bree, her character, would postpone or cancel having sex reassignment surgery because of the contact with her son. I was glad she remained true to herself. Her rebellious, alienated son seemed to be a generally plausible character and I was glad there was some ambiguity in their relationship in the ending, instead of a typical Hollywood happy ending, which would have seemed unrealistic given the storyline.       My only quibble with this otherwise very fine film is I wish the directors could have found a real male to female transsexual to play the role of Bree. This would have made her character seem even more believable.
0307346609|2.0|I found the book to be boring, with long interludes between occasionally gripping narrative passages.  The interviews do suffer from a similar voicing, with sentence structure unceasingly uniform throughout.  You're not likely to encounter such blandness were you to interview the neighbors on your street, never mind if you were to interview people from around the world(as the narrator claims to have done). <br /> <br />And then there are the requirements that you believe that zombies(human flesh here) don't dry out.   Why doesn't the flesh become dessicated and dehydrated?   Was every deceased plastinated?   I'd have much preferred if Brooks added some component of decay to the zombie experience, barring that he should have explained how his creation denies physical law. <br /> <br />Yes, I understand that the precept of a zombie novel denies physical law, but saying that human flesh doesn't dry out(and the zombies aren't carrying water bottles) but can freeze seems an unnecessary trespass on the readers goodwill.
B0006399FS|4.0|When U2 comes out with a new album, the anticipation and expectations are extremely high. This album did not disappoint.<br /><br />In October 2004, Vertigo was everywhere from ipod commercials to radio play. It was a hard rocking sound that made me so excited for the album to come out.<br /><br />When I bought the cd, I listened to it over, and over, and over. I am one of the biggest U2 fans out there and it takes me repeated listening to approve of their their new album.<br /><br />To sum it up, Original of the Species I believe is the standout track. It's probabaly one of their most beautiful songs ever recorded along with Stay, All I Want is You, and With or Without You.<br /><br />Other great tracks on the album are Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own, Yahweh and City of Blinding Lights. Overall a great album, but not their best. If you want U2's best album where every song just flows, then you must buy 1991's Achtung Baby.

0618680004|1.0|I found this book very childish. The author shows no scientific proof of his arguments and makes many errors in scriptures, theology, definition of faith,etc.. Don't read this book if you want to know if God is real. If you want to know if God is real just ask HIM.
0156030209|5.0|You wonder how an author could conceive, let alone execute, a book like this.  It is truly one of those rare books that will fascinate readers of all ages.  It will become a classic. You will want to spend the rest of your life visiting zoos -- unless you are one of the pathetic few who suffer from ZD (\\"Zoo Derangement\\").  And you will never take to the water in a boat out of sight of land and not recall this epic voyage of a boy and a tiger.  You will never look at a tiger -- or mankind, for that matter --the same way again. And, as a character in the book says: \\"This story will make you believe in God.\\"  A great piece of work!
B00065JTBA|5.0|100,000,000 BON JOVI FANS CAN'T BE WRONG is a great boxed set mixing unreleased songs with a few rare tracks. Whoever gave this one two stars DOES NOT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT!!!!! Sure, the many ballads (perhaps more than the right proportion) here can be a drag, but the rockers are all great, and they really show you another side of Bon Jovi other than the one we all know. This boxed set is a great tribute to a great rocker, and a great human being who opposes Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist and advocates increased funding for law enforcement, and makes a great supplement to Bon Jovi's proper albums.
B00000FCBC|5.0|THE BAND: James Hetfield (lead vocals, guitar), Kirk Hammett (guitars), Jason Newsted (bass), Cliff Burton (bass on \\"Am I Evil\\" and \\"Blitzkrieg\\" only), Lars Ulrich (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1998) 27 total tracks clocking in at approximately 137 minutes (disc-1 approximately 66 minutes, disc-2 approximately 71 minutes). Included with the disc is a 28-page booklet containing song titles/credits, Metallica band pictures old & new, album covers and/or band photos of artists being covered, and 20-pages of written bio by David Fricke (Managing Editor, Rolling Stone Magazine). Disc-1 recorded Sept/Oct 1998 at The Plant Studios, Sausalito, CA. Disc-2 recorded at numerous locations from 1984-95. This is their 8th album. Label - Elektra.<br /><br />COMMENTS: All cover tunes. Brilliant idea. Metallica pays homage to the bands they grew up with and admired. Many of the songs they cover here are hard to find - and you may not find them anywhere else but here. A few of my all-time favorite Metallica tracks are here... \\"Blitzkrieg\\", \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\", and \\"Killing Time\\". New classics from disc-1 include \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\" (Black Sabbath), \\"Astronomy\\" (Blue Oyster Cult), \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" (Lynyrd Skynyrd), and \\"It's Electric\\" (Diamond Head). Two great covers of \\"Turn The Page\\" (Bob Seger) and \\"Whiskey In The Jar\\" (Thin Lizzy) were also excellent, but sadly destroyed by being over played on the radio. Other artists being covered on \\"Garage Inc.\\" include those listed above as well as Danzig, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Killing Joke, Motorhead (4 songs featured), Queen, Budgie (2 songs), Mercyful Fate (the track \\"Mercyful Fate\\" is a medley of their songs - \\"Satan's Fall\\", \\"Curse of the Pharaohs\\", \\"A Corpse Without Soul\\", \\"Into The Coven\\", \\"Evil\\"... at over 11 minutes, it's Metallica's longest song ever recorded), etc. \\"Garage Inc.\\" enjoyed success on the charts - reached #2 on the Billboard Top 200 Album charts for 1998; singles \\"Turn the Page\\" (#1 on the Mainstream Rock charts), \\"Whiskey In The Jar\\" (#4 - also won a Grammy Award for best hard rock performance), and \\"Die, Die My Darling\\" (#26). This release - Great idea. Lots of music. Great songs (some more classic than others) played by one of the best metal bands of the '80's/90's.

B000IFS0HM|5.0|After seeing how  many reviews \\"Angela's Ashes\\" have, I was hesitating if I should add my own. At the end, I decided to do so, without reading the other reviews. Maybe I will repeat things already said, but I wanted to express my opinion because this book deserves all the good words it gets.<br /><br />Memoir is an increasingly popular type of prose - essentially, everyone feels they can write a memoir. And this is true, of course. The difficult thing, which not just anyone can achieve, is writing a good memoir, which would stand out of the crowd. Frank McCourt succeeded in this respect.<br /><br />\\"Angela's Ashes\\" describe the the author's memories from his earliest years until he is nineteen. His family is central to the book, which starts when his parents, Angela and Malachy, meet, they live in Brooklyn, where Frank, his brother Malachy, the twins and the sister are born. Then it follows the family through the deaths of several children, the return to Ireland, the fight with objective difficulties as well as the personal faults, Frank's illnesses, observations, the life of the street children and poor people in Limerick, Frank's school years during the World War II, until his travel back to America. The family is, in a way, a typical Irish family with a curse of alcoholism hanging over it, with the history of Ireland present at every moment, with the respect for Irish tradition and Catholic church, with poverty and daily struggle. But despite the accurate descriptions of the shortcomings of his parents, and a great dose of bitterness and criticism, McCourt manages to show his affection towards them and leave the reader without doubt as to his love for both of them. The insights into the society, system and life of the community are very accurate and sharp as well.<br /><br />The book, written from a position of the child growing up, which is reflected in the language and imagery, evokes powerful emotions. So strong, that it brigs tears to the eyes and leaves the reader in wonder. There is, however, a fair share of humor especially later in the book, so everything is well balanced yet natural.<br /><br />The Pullitzer prize was, in this case, deserved. I heartily recommend \\"Angela's Ashes\\" and will definitely read (and review) \\"'Tis\\".e is, however, a fair share of humor especially later in the book, so everything is well balanced yet natural.

Out of curiosity, I read the first few pages and found myself unable to stop. Absolutely amazing.<br /><br />I don't think many books can compare to this one. Humanity and sincerity in the first degree.<br /><br />I not only bought it again for my sister, I think I've probably made about 15 other people read it. Not a single one wasn't as elated as I was.

This is a brillant book and without a doubt Carlos Ruiz Zafon has a fantastic imagination.

B000A2WF3S|5.0|Kremer beautifully states how a composition's interpretations could be infinite. Well, there could be many that even Bach couldn't have fathomed how brilliantly they could be executed. This, of all of them, may be considered as one of the BEST  - Infinity's End! <br /> <br />The esoteric Chaconne apart, the standout track is the easily likeable and the most famous Prelude of Partita No. 3 (1006, E Major) - Kremer uses a breathtaking speed and has a God-like control over the dynamics - remarkable! Be it for collection of the entire Solo Violin Partitas and Sonatas or for simple listening pleasure of a brilliant interpretation, this is a must for all Bach connoisseurs. <br />
B00003CXFV|5.0|Julia Roberts gave a brilliant performance here as Erin Brockovich, a single mother who's temper is about as short as her skirts.  When she loses her case against the doctor who caused the car accident she was involved in she somewhat forces her way into a clerical job at the law offices of Ed Masry (Albert Finney), the lawyer that lost her case.  After reading a few files and growing genuinely concerned about a few clients Erin decides to investigate a case involving poisoned water supply that is slowing killing off the residents in Hinkley, California.  Julia gives such an effortless performance here that she doesn't even appear to be acting.  Everything is so natural, and that can be said for her cast mates as well.  Albert Finney is brilliant as the lawyer who's as offset as he is intrigued by his new employee's personality.  He perfectly compliments her in every scene they share, and the same can be said for Aaron Eckhart who plays George, Erin's neighbor who falls in love with her and offers her the stability she's always needed and never received.  This film, if nothing else, is a beautiful canvas for these talented actors, but acting aside, the script helps move the film along effortlessly and smoothly offering a top notch movie experience that never grows weary or tired.
B000006NL3|5.0|The Velvet Underground is, for me, rock's - or specifically indie/alternative rock's - all time greatest band because it is its most influential. The list of bands and musicians influenced and inspired by the VU is enormous and includes U2, the Cure, the Strokes, REM, Luna, the Jesus and Mary Chain, and Patti Smith, to name just a few. I am the proud owner of their boxed set, Peel Slowly and See which is one of the few boxed sets I own. I also own some solo records by various Velvets, including Lou Reed, Nico, and John Cale. I brought my friends to see the film \\"I Shot Andy Warhol,\\" which reconstructed the era of Warhol's Factory, when the Velvets (well played in the film by Yo La Tengo) were the house band. I now own a copy of that fine film, as well.<br /><br />Even though I was born in 1961, and was thus a bit too young to have known about and understood the Warhol Factory era, I do remember the tail end of the 60s. And I remember Greenwich Village and lower Manhattan from back then. I had an aunt who loved the City and who used to take me over there, from our NJ home, on a regular basis and I have specific memories of witnessing 60s freaks in Washington Square Park. I must have been about six years old at the time. As I got older, I came to a realization of the significance of the 60s, of Warhol, of Greenwich Village, and of the seminal band connected to all three: Lou Reed, John Cale, Mo Tucker, Sterling Morrison - the Velvet Underground.<br /><br />I bought a rather old, scratchy copy of this record, which I found in a used record bin, while in high school in the mid/late 1970s, which is also the period of time when I, influenced by 70s rock mags like Creem and Circus, began to discover the music of Lou Reed (e.g., Coney Island Baby, Transformer, Street Hassle, etc). However, I didn't truly get deeply into Lou and the Velvets until a bit later, when I bought a Velvet compilation, and began listening to them, as well as the various Velvets solo stuff more frequently and carefully. Nevertheless, having first listened to this record and its classic proto noise/no wave track Sister Ray, when I did, planted a seed. I recall liking a few of the songs here - the title track, Sister Ray, and Here She Comes Now, and not quite knowing what to make of the rest, particularly John Cale's nihilistic little story song the Gift or Lou's freakout guitar solo on I Heard Her Call My Name. I was also less than impressed with the cruddy production values of the recording, made worse by my scratchy used copy.<br /><br />Listening now, and thinking about it further, I now realize what a gem even a scratchy used copy of this is. This, indeed, is a GREAT album, truly a classic. This is mainly Lou's album, and in it, you can hear him asserting himself as the band's leader. And you can also hear the band pushing him back. And listening to the whole band thrash away on Sister Ray - with its deviantly awkward, erotically charged lyrics -one hears what a rock drone is meant to be. In short, the lo-fi production and the inherent tensions within the band made for a proto-punk, proto-indie rock classic recording, one which truly captures the anomic and polarized mood of the late 60s, a time of drugs, violence, political confrontation, of social and artistic change. The whole world was being turned upside down, and the Velvet Underground managed to capture a small piece of the tenor of the times.<br /><br />This recording belongs in the music collection of everyone interested in the history of rock, punk, indie rock or Warholiana.lly.

I purchased the DVD and the two songs accompanied by the USC Trojans are horrendous! You can't hear the brass section. All you hear is the percussion. I was greatly disappointed because those were my two favorite performances originally BECAUSE of the Trojans. You see them dancing and playing, but the sound is left out. Boo Hoo! Buckingham's performance of Big Love is a major highlight.

0307346609|5.0|<br />Mr. Max Brooks was one of the many authors of a comprehensive UN report of the Zombie War. <br />- A must read for every president, military strategist, and architect. <br />  <br />Many of these researchers -Like Mr. Brooks- risked, and continue to risk their lives in infested zones. (I'm happy to have guarded the census takers at Glen Canyon hydrodam, while they counted the floating dead (and undead) in lake Powell.) <br /> <br />Yet, though thorough in its attention to detail, and wide in scope, the UN report leaves out much. <br />Somehow in 500+ pages, they forgot to tell our story. <br /> <br />Fortunately, Mr. Brooks has published a volume of the unreleased material on his own. <br />This is not a dry UN report. This is an oral history telling the stories of survivors, from their own points of view. <br /> <br />People like you and me. <br /> <br />These are stories of the hardships we ALL faced, together. <br /> <br />If not from Zack, then from the starvation, the fighting, or disease.  <br />Those of use left must bare the guilt, and responsibility as survivors to carry on. <br /> <br />We faced our own extinction right in the mouth, and put a bullet in its brain! <br /> <br />Which makes these stories also about our triumph! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />At first, I was skeptical that anyone should publish this early. <br /> <br />I mean, Zack is STILL out there, afterall! If we let our guard down, for even a moment, the hordes WILL rise again. They never grow tired, and so we can't grow tired either. <br /> <br />But, I'm no longer skeptical. <br /> <br />I've read these oral histories. I see their value. Sometimes just surviving, not giving in, is an honorable thing. <br /> <br />I know it's hard.  <br /> <br />This book brings the memories you'd like to forget.  <br /> <br />I pause every time Yonkers is mentioned. I lost many friends, and my faith on that day. <br /> <br />My point is, you need to look back sometimes. <br /> <br />If it stillhurts to speak openly about the war right now; then encourage the children to read it.  <br /> <br />Someone needs to tell them YOUR story.
B000H0MKO2|4.0|\\"Thank You For Smoking\\" uses the topic of smoking to explore how our political system in the United States works. It's all about twisting the truth, being supposedly \\"fair and balanced,\\" and dealing with spin... and counter-spin. In fact, this movie could have just as easily been titled \\"Lobbyists and Politics in the USA\\" although that wouldn't have been quite so catchy... and the movie is all about techniques used to catch the public's attention, sway the opinions of the masses, and make your opponents look inept and dishonest.<br /><br />It's hard to say if the protagonist (Nick Naylor played by Eckhart) is a hero or an anti-hero. He cuts through as much BS as he produces. Involving Naylor's 12-year-old son in the plot was a brilliant device to force the protagonist to confront the true nature of his lobbying efforts and I'm glad to say that the writer didn't take the easy way out by having the protagonist renunciate his role as a lobbyist for big tobacco. (Those who see this movie as being primarily about the tobacco industry are likely to miss some of its allegorical potential. For instance, the Bush administration bears a tremendous number of similarities to big tobacco as portrayed in this movie.)<br /><br />The version of the DVD that I purchased includes many valuable Special Features that help elucidate the making of the movie. It includes extensive commentary, deleted scenes, and an interview with Charlie Rose. The deleted scenes includes an alternative ending where the protagonist does compromise the integrity of his character (by plucking a cigarette out of his son's mouth in public), but fortunately the director selected a more challenging ending.

B000HEWEEE|3.0|As many people from cities by The Great Lakes know, the lake effect can change with variable winds and bring snow squalls and rains unexpectedly.  The winds of change are presented in a relationship that straddles a time barrier, a time warp that is bridged by a magic mailbox where messages are transported back and forth between two residents of a specially designed \\"lake house\\".  One resident is a Chicago architect, Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), whose father was the architect of the stunning, but idiosyncratic glass \\"lake house\\" on \\"stilts\\".  He lives there in 2004.  Kate Forster, a resident doctor, lives at the residence in 2006.  She moves out, but leaves a message in the mailbox for the new owner to forward her mail to her new address.  He intercepts the note two years earlier and leaves her a note that her new address is under construction, and her reference to animal tracks left on the residence aren't apparent.  Both are curious by the discrepancies of the other's notes.  His letters have the heading 2004; her letters have the heading 2006.  Then a mysterious but lively exchange of letters takes place.  They address these concerns, and the movie makes us take some leaps to bridge the incredulity gap.  (Wouldn't most people dismiss the other as wacko with some sort of anomoly?)  Fortunately, even though there is enough effort by the audience to suspend disbelief, there is no magic Post Office actually delivering the mail.  Somehow they believe one another and fall in love.      There are some connections made besides the mailbox over the two year communication gap:  One is the same resident dog who is present for both owners; the other is a copy of Kate's favorite book, Jane Austin's 'Persuasion'.  The former never forgets an owner, so his straying provides a meeting between the two during a time she wouldn't know the context of the letters in 2004.  It is her birthday, and her trusting, live-in boyfriend invites the stranger neatly enough when his dog runs to the new residence they share.  The event turns into a date that becomes awkward upon her boyfriend's discovery.  An emotional connection is made, even though Kate thinks of him as a newcomer in her life.  The book provides a tangible presence and a fine allusion to another story about an old-fashioned courtship where the protagonists wait for a romance tested over time.      Alex has two barriers to straddle.  He struggles with a hard-to-please architect mentor father who in Alex's own words, \\"...knew how to make a house, but not a home.\\"  The emotional baggage is telling between himself and his father, especially when his dad's health heads south.  (And all of this is presented well with the friendly sibling rivalry with his brother, Henry.)  But the biggest barrier is trying to schedule a date with the future Kate.  He goes to Chicago's best restaurant to make a date two years in advance with her and shares his plan in a letter.  He does his best to keep the engagement, yet she is stood up, and from there she abandons hope of them ever connecting.  That is until she discovers the reason for his failure, and this leads to a chance... a chance that one can alter events and change the future.    'The Lake House' is a pleasing and manipulative romantic movie.  It plays upon all of our buttons.  Relying on narrated letters, the movie draws upon films like 'Sleepless in Seattle' and its follow-up, 'You've Got Mail'.  Romance mainly emanates from the longing presented, and the narration of the correspondence crossing the two-year distance for both would-be lovers.  As languid as some of the scenes linger on, the resolution is strong enough to recommend this stylish and heartwarming flick about love that is meant to bridge the gap of space and time.  Just like \\"the lake effect,\\" 'The Lake House' sneaks up on one and provides powerful changes that neatly blow away the debris and provide a clearer day.

0143034901|5.0|There is a lot to entertain readers of The Shadow of the Wind. This novel draws on many literary traditions--mystery, magical realism, and gothic romance, among others. The plot is like a Russian nesting doll set--seemingly never-ending in terms of new surprises, mysteries, and twists. A brilliant mix of characters populates the novel, including many eccentric and humorous minor characters. Zafon uses the motif of the search for identity which quickly turns into multiple searches for multiple identities. The setting of Barcelona from the 1930's to the 50's is so richly drawn, you come to realize it is another character adding to the mysteries that abound in this story, as well as another character in search of itself. Zafon is expert in pacing his plot and manipulating the moods of the story. I can only testify to my admiration of Zafon's work and my enjoyment in reading the novel. To attempt to summarize the story would result either in oversimplification or overamplification.
B00004BZ16|5.0|Why the heck this terrific album isn't mentioned as a Clash masterwork in the same breath as LONDON CALLING is a mystery to me. Coming out when it did at the tail-end of 1980, SANDINISTA! was so unlike anything else on the landscape of Punk and New Wave that I, for one, got drawn in right away. It's an album that dared to break the \\"Year Zero\\" mentality that ultimately made Punk and New Wave a cul-de-sac, and grab onto rockabilly, gospel, sound collages ala \\"Revolution #9,\\" rap and lots and lots and lots of dub, all the while sounding like nobody else but The Clash. And you want classic toons? Try \\"The Magnificent Seven,\\" \\"The Call Up,\\" \\"Police On My Back\\" (which was penned by Eddy Grant), \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\" (probably the best track here) and a load of others.<br /><br />So it wasn't under two minutes, super-loud, super-fast and snarling all the way through. Get over it. SANDINISTA! is a great album.

On fourth viewing, I fell in love with all of it - the spectacle of court and war, the dances, Verdi's use of the orchestra, the heartbreakingly beautiful pieces he wrote for Aida, the stunning (as in, \\"it stuns me\\") ending. It amazes me how Verdi can move seamlessly from spectacle (e.g. the triumphal march) to the most intimate of songs (\\"Numi, pieta,\\" \\"O patria mia\\"). And, uncharacteristically, Verdi gets downright sensuous in Act II, Scene 1 where Amneris is dressed and pampered by her ladies and her slaves. The final scene is nothing short of brilliant: Verdi ends this bigger-than-life opera not with the brass of the orchestra blasting away but with the most intimate of scenes, accompanied by strings alone. Yes, the lovers die, but it's Verdi's brilliant overlay of their death duet with Amneris' prayer for peace - she, who must live with what she's done - that has me crying every time.<br /><br />There are a wealth of Aida DVD's to choose from. What sets this production apart is the staging. The Gran Teatre del Liceu of Barcelona used trompe-d'oeil sets that were painted on paper by Josep Mestres Cabanes for a production of Aida in 1945. When the opera closed, the paper sets were removed from their wooden frames and stored away. Almost 60 years later, set designer Jordi Castellis had them restored for this production. There are over 100 planes of paper and they are absolutely stunning - lush and colorful, rich in detail. This production is worth seeing just for the sets; it's like being at a Catalonian art exhibit.<br /><br />The performances, however, are uneven and that's why four stars, not five. Daniela Dessi is a favorite soprano of mine. Even though she can be shrill in the upper register, I forgive this because she always moves me. She projects a fascinating combination of strength and vulnerability. She humanizes every role, making us feel as if the character is someone we might know and care about in real life. She gives a heartrending performance of \\"Numi, pieta.\\" Her pianissimo is stunning.<br /><br />Dessi's real life husband, Fabio Armiliato, doesn't excel as Radames although he improves in the later part of the opera. He tends to just blurt out his songs with little interpretation or nuance. He and Dessi do have great onstage chemistry though!<br /><br />I was also disappointed in Elisabetta Fiorillo as Amneris although other reviewers here thought she was excellent. Her voice is indeed powerful, but she sings as if it's a solo performance. Even in the ensemble pieces, she continually faces the audience, raising her arms straight out to her sides, creating this massive rectangle with her robe. The effect is that she appears to be on the stage by herself instead of part of an ensemble. For me, it ruins the great Act IV, Scene 1 duet with Radames. (By contrast, Dolora Zajick in The Met production from 1989 not only sings Amneris powerfully and beautifully, but the intensity of her interactions in the scenes with Radames and Aida make my spine tingle.)<br /><br />The DVD includes a documentary on Josep Mestres Cabanes' sets and how they were restored.

B00003CWTI|5.0|In Dogville Vs. Hollywood I wrote a single line on Magnolia, calling it \\"a sprawling, only partly successful imitation of Altman, [that] suggested Anderson was a filmmaker with aspirations possibly beyond his talents.\\" Having seen the film for second time, seven years later, I have some serious crow to eat.<br /><br />A soaring, almost wholly successful work (some scenes with Julianne Moore still strike me as overwrought and heavy-handed), Magnolia seems to me now the most heartfelt and original movie epic since, well, since forever. (I was going to say since Nashville, but the truth is, Magnolia is a considerably richer and more personal work than Altman's.)<br /><br />There's no doubt Anderson's ambitions as a filmmaker border on hubris; but what's truly astonishing is that he actually has the wherewithal to see them through and do almost complete justice to them. With only his third film, Anderson made a masterpiece, a film that walks the high-wire between nigh-esoteric subtlety and melodrama bordering on soap opera, and it does so without a net. (At over three hours running time and a cost of over $40 million, anything less than a tour-de-force could have vaporized Anderson as surely as Heaven's Gate vaporized Cimino.) Even so, Magnolia confounded many viewers (myself included obviously) with its brazen originality and disregard for movie conventions. To fully appreciate the scope, depth, and intensity of Anderson's film, it may be necessary to meet the writer-director halfway, to allow his peculiar vision to unfold at its own tempo and in its own, unique manner. However brilliant a movie, Magnolia is not an ingratiating work; Anderson appears to deliberately confound his audience's preconceptions about both art and entertainment, delivering a work unlike any other American movie of the last thirty years, without apology. As Anderson said to the crew on the first day of shooting, making a great movie is \\"nothing to be ashamed of.\\"<br /><br />As a work of art, Magnolia is hugely entertaining, as well as being the closest American movies have come in recent years to a genuine labor of love. Against all odds, Anderson has made an intimate epic that stays true to his individual vision, a film that is both disturbingly personal and sweepingly universal in its reach. Anderson makes a proud and plaintive cry to be saved from the ranks of the freaks who suspect they can never love anyone; and the deeper he reaches into his own heart and soul, the more profoundly he connects with ours.<br /><br />With his ability to pull off something this freakish--a movie that, by all the usual standards for judging movies, simply should not work--Paul Thomas Anderson proved himself to be a truly Promethean talent, a bona fide filmmaking genius. As Pauline Kael wrote of Coppola in his heyday (The Godfather Part Two), \\"that's the inner voice of the authentic hero.\\"art, Magnolia is hugely entertaining, as well as being the closest American movies have come in recent years to a genuine labor of love.

B000002IAZ|5.0|This is a good collection of Buffalo Springfield. There is the omission of a couple of songs that I expected to be on here, but overall this album is an excellent compiliation.<br /><br />Particularly solid and classic are: For What It's Worth, Bluebird, Broken Arrow, and Expecting to Fly.<br /><br />This is definately the CD for someone who wants to quickly get aquainted with the music of Buffalo Springfield. Buffalo Springfield had many talented musicians, not the least of which were Neil Young, Richie Furray, and Stephen Stills.
B000001DV2|5.0|`Andrenalize' was released 4 years after the mega-successful `Hysteria' and in many ways it is often compared to it's predecessor to it's own detriment. I however can't see why people think less of this album than they do of `Hysteria' because to me it just sounds like `Hysteria' Part II, yet that may be part of the reason. There were great songs on `Adrenalize' from the power ballads of `Heaven Is' and `Have You Ever Wanted Someone So Bad' to hard rockers like ` Tear It Down' and the smutty `Make Love Like A Man' and `Tonight' the socially conscious `White Lightning' to throw away fun like `Let's Get Rocked'. For me Def Leppard represented what rock was supposed to be about: Fun. Def Leppard also had great artwork at the time, something that they seem to have lost sight of (see X) which annoys me terribly because I believe in the whole package.<br /><br />1992 was a terribly uncertain time for a band like Def Leppard when they released `Adrenalize', the previous year had seen the emergence from the underground of Nirvana with their `Nevermind' album. Seismic changes would be put into effect as a result of the emergence of what would be called alternative rock or grunge. It really difficult to pinpoint exactly why things changed, but the fact remains that 80's style hair metal within a year would become a dirty word. However at the time it was not unusual to see bands like Mr Big and Guns `n' Roses alongside Nirvana and R.E.M. in the charts. Def Leppard would later feel the effect of these changes and alter their sound in a bid for survival. Not only Def Leppard but also colossal giant of thrash metal like Metallica and Megadeth would follow suit and as a result 1994 - 1996 will always for me be the years of sell-outs. What they failed to recognise is that at the time fans would happily listen to Nirvana, Def Leppard, Metallica, Deicide, R.E.M., U2, Ice Cube, Culture Beat, Madonna and Snap all on the same day. It wasn't the fan that brought about the changes but the industry jumping on bandwagons, so don't blame fans for your falling fortunes, blame yourself. 1992 was the year that the buying public began to have more choice when it came to music, music was expanding and fracturing into a myriad of genres and sub genres until what we have to today, where what is in the chart is complete crap because what is bought is bought by the musically lazy with no real interest in music. The good stuff is still there, one just has to look for it and that is why the Internet is a vital tool and Amazon a godsend.he industry jumping on bandwagons, so don't blame fans for your falling fortunes, blame yourself. 1992 was the year that the buying public began to have more choice when it came to music, music was expanding and fracturing into a myriad of genres and sub genres until what we have to today, where what is in the chart is complete crap because what is bought is bought by the musically lazy with no real interest in music.

B000E97HIA|2.0|I bought the cd Musicology and enjoy it thoroughly. I was excited to get the new cd. However, I find many of the tracks very strange and a little disturbing. (the first song kind of creeps me out.) I give this cd a 2 because I do enjoy 2 of the songs on the cd but I am dissapointed because I hoped for better.
B000001FS3|5.0|I first purchased a copy of `The Joshua Tree' on tape when I was 15 years old after I had bought `Rattle and Hum'. I loved many of the new songs on `Rattle and Hum' like Heartland, Desire and Hawkmoon 269 so `The Joshua Tree' was a natural purchase. This is where the problem starts and where I differ from a lot of other `Joshua Tree' fans but the reason may be lost on the CD generation. (Side A / Side B) Bands often put all their best material on Side A of a record through a sometimes pain staking selection process. The problem I have with this album is that I prefer and believe side B to be infinitely superior to Side A.<br /><br />I always thought Side A of the `Joshua Tree' was average yet it contained many fan favourites as well as hit songs. `Where The Streets Have No Name' felt like an empty epic opener, similar to the song `Zooropa', and the reason for all the desert metaphors. `I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' with it's gospel flavour didn't appeal and never felt like the real deal, although the older I got the more it appealed lyrically. `With Or Without You' I couldn't identify with at 15 and still can't, although it is a decent song. `Bullet The Blue Sky' felt like a return to War era material and is much better live (just listen to the live version on Rattle And Hum). So the only song on Side A that I liked was `Running To Stand Still' with it's Ry Cooder-like intro probably influenced by Wim Wenders `Paris, Texas' (1984) soundtrack. The problem is that Side A just feels like it's laboured and lacking any real spark.<br /><br />However flip over the Record to side B we have a completely different and much better record. First up was `Red Hill Mining Town' about the UK miner strikes and damage it caused to relationships. Then `In God's Country' comes flying out of the blocks with The Edge's guitar sounding like lightning breaking up the desert sky. Bono's vocal delivery is impassioned and earnest, like he had something to say and you were going to hear it whether you like it or not. Not only that but one actually starts to notice that Larry and Adam are actually in the band, both punching a hole through the mix. `In God's Country' and `Trip Through Your Wires' continue in much the same vein slowing down a bit for `One Tree Hill' by which time Bono's vocals have become virtually hoarse. Then the next song is what I believe to be one of U2's greatest, darkest and my personal favourite on the album then and now: `Exit' a menacing song about a man on the edge with only one alternative left. Larry literally sounds like he's trying to beat the living daylights out of his drum kit. The song reaches such a climax that there's almost nowhere else to go other than down for `Mothers Of The Disappeared' inspired I believe by Luis Puenzo's `The Official Story' (1986).her you like it or not.

B000I2IT44|5.0|Tell me that Porcupine Tree isn't the greatest band on planet Earth at this time (I dare you!) This DVD was everything I hoped for if not more. These guys have to be the most talented bunch assembled together since I don't know when. The sound is great and there is a good representation of their styles and repertoire. Of course you always wish there was a certain favorite song included, but we can't reasonably expect the band to accomodate every individual taste, can we? I appreciate how the film crew includes each member and doesn't focus in only on Steven Wilson. Each member of this group contributes to the nth degree, icluding touring member John Wesley. Great vocal harmonies, rhythm guitar and some awesome lead guitar solos by this young man. My hats off to him. I haven't made it to the second disc. I was mainly concerned with the concert footage which didn't disappoint! Love the humble side of Steven on the last track (don't want to give it away!) He is a genious, but most importantly a music fan who wants to produce great music. And I think that's what fans appreciate the most about this great band. They put everything into their music, including the cover art and memorabilia. If you don't get a chance to see these guys, this should pacify you until they arrive somewhere near you...
B000GPIPVU|4.0|This is a very good record.  But it should have been even better.      Here is the problem.  It is a moment from Shelter, Ray's best-known song from \\"Trouble\\".  In the second chorus, as Ray plaintively sings that he Will Shelter You, the strings come in and the song heads into the stratosphere.  A great song, beautifully orchestrated.    In \\"Till The Sun Turns Black\\" Ray and his producer seem to be looking for that moment again and again but instead the orchestration pulls down some otherwise great songs.   Two of the best examples are the opening Be Here Now and the albums title track Till the Sun Turns Black.    Be Here Now is an epic song that has been on repeat from the moment I first heard it.  That the cd starts with this meditative six plus minute song is a hint that this cd was not just made to churn out sales.  Yet as great as the song is, as great as Ray's controlled, whisper-like vocal is, as tasteful as much of the production is, this song has a moment too.  In the second verse, after you are already totally sold, the strings become overblown and somewhat sappy.  Something that is totally unnecessary when there is a singular voice like Ray's to carry the song.  It is still the best song on the album, but that moment is a little bit of a let down.    On the title track the strings are so far out of control it turns a very good song into a ho-hum affair.  There is a live version of this song that I've been listening to for almost a year- just Ray, accompanying his own vocal with guitar.  There is NO comparison between the two versions.  The lyrics may be a little trite, but the power of Ray's voice on the live version, especially at the chorus, is front and center- a force to be reckoned with.     That said, there are many excellent songs on the record, and many of them are orchestrated very well.  For the first four songs alone the cd is worth the price and is more to my taste than most of Trouble.      Perhaps the problem is insecurity.  Ray just needs to believe in the power of his own songs and his voice and he will be fine.  There is nothing wrong with adding instrumentation; he just needs to find the right balance.  Neil Young used brass and strings to great effect on some of his landmark songs from the '70's.      Ray has said one of his main influences is Stephen Stills.  A song like 4+20 from Deja Vu is perfect in it's spare and quiet brilliance. Maybe he needs to look to Neil more when the urge strikes to add those cinematic flourishes.  Not that Neil is immune, as anyone who's ever heard A Man Needs A Maid will attest.                Update- After a few months listening time I have to give the nod to \\"Trouble\\" as the better album overall.  Other than the first four songs, this cd kind of bores me...  I would revise down to 3 stars.

B000AMPZGC|5.0|I got this soundtrack on October 15, 2005, Saturday, since I was totally dying to see the movie (back then, I hadn't seen the movie, and I was totally dying too) and I read a bunch of reviews fot the album on amazon.com, and listening to some of the song samples.  Lots of reviews told me  that it was really good. So I went to Tower Records and bought this soundtrack along with a $20.00 gift card as a birthday present for one of my best friends. I listened to this soundtrack right when I got home, and I LOVED IT!! Right when I put the CD into my CD player, put on my earphones, and turned on the CD player, I heard the main titles for the first time. Worrying a few times that it might not be good and that I had wasted my money, I was pleased to hear that the first track, the main title, was a gorgeous melody, and I listened to the whole CD. I enjoyed every single track, and this is one of the few CDs in which I enjoy every single songs. But some of the songs were very special to me, and I'm thrilled to hear that Corpse Bride is an animated musical, since I love those kind of movies as a toddler, and still do as a 13-year-old. However, it's disappointing that there's only 4 songs with lyrics when I bet Danny Elfman could've composed even more awesome songs with lyrics for this movie. But if he did do that, then it would take longer to animate this movie, considering how the producers took about a decade to film this movie. And I really wish that the piano pieces were longer and had an actual ending. Anyway, here's what I say about the tracks.<br /><br />1) Main Titles: This was a great beginning to the album, with a lot of sweet instruments playing this piece and a great, touching melody. It was eerie, gorgeous beyond words can describe, and soothing. I loved the ticking of the clock in the middle of the song.<br /><br />2) According To Plan: I was really, really impressed with this song. I loved how Victor's and Victoria's parents were fussing over the arranged wedding in this catchy, amusing song. I just LOVE that clever line that goes, \\"and that's why everything, every last little thing, every single, tiny, microscopic, little thing must gooooooooo according to plan!\\"<br /><br />3) Victor's Piano Solo: Wow. I was so moved by this piece. It's so beautiful, it took my breath away. Sometimes I repeat this song. Before watching the movie, I visualized Victor playing his solo in private in a Victorian parlor with warm sunshine streaming from a window upon him and his piano. It sounds better on the soundtrack than it does in the movie.<br /><br />4) Into the Forest: A great beginning, and it was really relaxing to listen to. Until the part when the music gets really eerie and silent, and then, IT'S LOUD! And the choir begins singing notes in these eerie voices. This is music is played during the scene in which Victor goes to the forest to practice his vows and accidentally ends up marrying Emily the Corpse Bride.<br /><br />5) Remains of the Day: I love the jazzy, upbeat melody and singing that Bonejangles sings to Victor about the tragic story of Emily the Corpse Bride. Two thumbs up for the creative lyrics!<br /><br />6) Casting a Spell: Uh, not so great. Kinda boring, but also pretty eerie and kinda dark-sounding. But a bit cool.<br /><br />7) Moon Dance: This track is sooooooo relaxing, beautiful, and sweet. I've heard it's kinda similar to the song \\"Ice Dance\\" from Edward Scissorhands. But I love this. I can just picture Emily dancing happily.<br /><br />8) Victor's Deception: Another song I'm not very impressed with. But I love the part in this song when Victor and Victoria see each other again and talk and lean in for a kiss.<br /><br />9) Tears To Shed: The parts when the Black Widow and the Maggot sing are amusing and but little cheesy. Emily, who is voiced by the beautiful actress Helena Bonham Carter, sings so beautifully and I can hear the sadness reflected in her voice, except she isn't the best singer, though. I love the flute that plays in the background when she sings.<br /><br />10) Victoria's Escape: I love this one! I love the end of this song, because it's pretty eerie-sounding and dark. It's the part when Victoria goes into the church and begs Pastor Galswell to help Victor.<br /><br />11)The Piano Duet: It's SO beautiful, especially when it switches from the melody of Tears To Shed to this beautiful, moving melody with a quicker beat. I can see why people wished the piano pieces were longer.<br /><br />12) New Arrival: I love how this song blasts into my ears. It's about 40 seconds of lively jazz music.<br /><br />13) Victoria's Wedding: An interesting song. The scene where Victoria is married to Barkis and Victor grieves over his loss of losing his opportunity to marry her and decides to marry Emily instead.<br /><br />14)The Wedding Song: I can see why people say this is their least favorite song on the soundtrack. I used to think it was lame and weird, but I like it now. My favorite part is when the female singers sing about how Emily the Corpse Bride has arrived and that her dream of marriage has come true.<br /><br />15) The Party Arrives: Eh, an okay song, I guess. Not so interesting.<br /><br />16) Victor's Wedding: Love, love this one! I love it when it comes to the part when Emily tells Victor how she loves her, but she couldn't marry him because she felt Victoria was the one for him. And then Victor and Victoria are reunited. It makes me wanna cry.<br /><br />17) Barkis's Bummer: I didn't like this one. It's of Barkis entering the church, tries to take away Victoria, sees the Emily, the woman he murdered, fights with Victor, and gets poisoned.<br /><br />18) The Finale: Gorgeous piece. It's touching and perfect for the ending of a great story. Before seeing the movie, I visualized a wedding ceremony between Victor and Victoria taking place, Emily dissolving into butterflies on a balcony, and Victor and Victoria gaily leaving the church with confetti and rice showering them, with the newlyweds getting onto a horse-drawn carriage, leaving the church to start their new, married life, with the camera closing in on a graveyard. And then the credits come in.<br /><br />19) End Credits Part 1: I liked this piece a little better than the Main Titles. It's very beautiful, how it started out with a solemn solo by the piano with a instrument that sounds like the windchimes, and then long, sad notes from the cello. The violins and violas were beautiful, and I loved it when the flute played, since I'm a flute player myself. Once, tears came into my eyes as I was listening to it. It's just totally moving.<br /><br />20) End Credits Part 2: The second part of the credits sounds great! It's jazzy, fun, wild, and great to dance to. It's kinda like the first part of the end credits represents the Land of the Living and the second part represents the Land of the Dead.<br /><br />BONUS TRACKS FROM BONEJANGLES AND HIS BONE BOYS<br />(these songs were not played in the movie.

Pretty short, though.    24) Ball & Socket Lounge Music #1 (Combo Version): Eh, I prefer the band version of this song.    I LOVE THIS SOUNDTRACK!!!! And the movie is just equally wicked cool. People, if you're a freak for Corpse Bride, or if you haven't seen the movie and you're dying to see it, or just some Tim Burton fan, I recommend this item to you!!! I hope you'll enjoy this soundtrack as much as I do!
B000HCO840|3.0|First off, I just want to say that I love this movie series and, to a lesser extent, this particular movie.  I've said from the moment I walked out of the theater after seeing it that the filmmakers could have EASILY added another hour or so to the length of the movie to make it fantastic.  And what's with the title?  Last Stand!  Come on, there are so many things they haven't covered yet:  Apocalypse, Sentinels, the Morlocks, and, as many others have been saying, Gambit and lots more of Angel.      Having said that, compared to a movie of this size and importance (and budget), this is a pretty bare-bones dvd, especially for a \\"Collectors Edition.\\"  In fact, the only real difference between this and the regular widescreen version is that it comes with a little comic book (in fact it's a re-print of an old one-time X-Men comic that marks the additions of Wolverine, Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Thunderbird to the X-Men, but I hardly think that justifies spending an extra 4 bucks).     The one thing I noticed right off the bat that shocked me was that there is not a single behind the scenes featurette!  With all of the special effects and cool fight scenes in this movie, there should be at least a few really good featurettes.  Secondly, what the dvd does have, deleted scenes, alternate endings, and some other [...], are nothing really special.  Most of the deleted scenes are just slight variations of some scenes already in the movie (the extended version of the fight scene at Jean's house was pretty cool though) and the \\"alternate endings\\" are really disappointing.  Two are just short, alternate scenes that don't really conclude anything and the last one doesn't really make any sense (Spoiler:  Why in the world would Wolverine want to go back to Canada?).      How can they possibly call this a \\"Collector's Edition\\" if it's only one disc and has absolutely no featurettes!  They should have slowed down and taken their time with this one.  Come on, even Napoleon Dynamite had a 2 disc dvd set!

0060012358|5.0|Maurice is a great character, exactly what a talking cat would be like.  The story is an interesting spin on the story of the piper who plays the rats out of town that is set in Discworld.  The story has the wit and humor that all of Terry Pratchett's books have.  A really enjoyable read for kid and adult fans of Terry Pratchett.  It also has a good moral about working together to solve problems, but really you could ignore that if you wanted . . .
1400079179|3.0|I suppose everything has its fashions, from clothing to cars to literature.  The Da Vinci Code seems to be one such literary fashion.<br /><br />I will concede that Dan Brown is a good writer.  He knows how to tell a story and to tell it in an exciting, quick manner which makes it hard to put a book down.<br /><br />My objection though to the Da Vinci Code is not so much the story but rather the inflated claims Brown makes.<br /><br />Brown has claimed numerous times all of the material in his books is 'fact.'  These facts range from certain assertions about conspiracies involving countless secret societies in the Catholic Church (ranging from Opus Dei to the Knights Templar) to secret grails to Jesus being married to Mary Magdalane and ideas about a secret 'bloodline' which is the royal heritage of Jesus and Mary and wait for it, involves French Kings and other nobility.  Tacked on to this is the notion Da Vinci's paintings contain secret messages hidden from all but a few, and Harvard Professors of Symbology (a post which in fact does not exist).<br /><br />The truth is, Dan Brown has borrowed many of his ideas from other sources, which upon critical examination are showed to be somewhat dubious.  There are many books which explode the 'facts' Dan Brown uses (and good scholars like Bart Ehrman are generous enough to point out what Brown gets right as well as wrong) and they are too long to mention, but suffice to say it is better to try and enjoy this book for what it is; a good 'airport' novel you can read in a few hours, rather than a ground-breaking revelation about the true nature of Christianity, Opus Dei, Jesus and Mary Magdalene, the Louvre in Paris, and God knows what else.
1570429596|1.0|The idea that this book is a true story has been debunked many times, in most detail by John T. Reed. And it's unclear the Kiyosaki made any money investing in real estate, it seems much more likely his wealth stems from these books and the multi-level marketing schemes that helped make them successful.  <br /> <br />The book itself can be inspirational, but his specific advice is silly and wrong headed. Setup a corporation to get rich? Sure if you want to pay extra fees to lawyers and accounts and higher taxes. Deduct personal expenditures like watches and vacations from your taxes using your corporation? Sure if you want to commit tax fraud.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I have been looking for Billy Elliot for more than two years. I heard that it should be very good or even excellent film and another reason for watching it was that I have seen several Working Title films before (About a Boy, Notting Hill, Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral) and I found all of them much more sincere and emotional than average Hollywood products. Also these British films have something to offer that you rarely can find in Hollywood movies: a charming heartwarming mixture of sweet and funny comedy and inspiring and touching drama. Last month, finally, I found the tape. From very first moments of the movie my eyes were riveted to the screen and when the movie ended feelings and emotions overflowed me. Billy Elliot in my opinion Billy Elliot is a brilliant movie, easily one of the best movies of the year and most likely of the current decade. <br /> <br />Director of the movie Stephen Daldry brought to us an exceptional, truly inspiring and moving, emotional and poignant movie. The entire story and all the characters are completely believable and the atmosphere of small provincial town somewhere in North-Eastern England skillfully captured and transmitted to us. Sometimes the movie is sad, sometimes it's funny but Stephen Daldry's work never leave you indifferent. The story occurs in a small coal-mining town in 1984 and there are signs of a severe depression all over the town. You can see all around a shadow of distress and even poverty. Some simple but incredibly powerful scenes bring to us sad feeling of hopelessness and even despair. There is a big coalminers strike in the town but it's easy to see that it's also the hopeless strike. But all this is only a masterfully recreated background for main story of the title character, a twelve years old boy. He recently lost his mother and both his father and elder brother are striking coalminers. Billy is forced by his father to attend boxing classes and one day accidentally he see the girl ballet classes that occur in same room and he find ballet much more interesting than hated stupid boxing. So he attends those ballet classes instead the boxing and there is nothing surprising that after a few weeks his father suddenly finds out that Billy didn't attend boxing and worst of all he is attending the ballet classes. The main conflict occurs. <br /> <br />Billy must fight for his choice, fight against his own family. There are two stereotypes against him. First one is that ballet for girls, not for boys (lads do football... or boxing... or wrestling). And second sounds even worse: all male ballet dancers are gays. Billy is not but no one from his family except aged grandma want even heard about ballet. There are only two people in the whole town, who support him - middle-aged ballet teacher Mrs. Wilkinson and his friend Michael, who is the same age as Billy and who found that he is possibly a gay. This gay subplot easily became for conservative audience a very controversial question. But the fact is that such stereotypes are not invented by the director of the movie and if you would try to learn more about this terrific picture you will found that Jamie Bell, who took dance lessons from age six, suffered from similar sneers and taunts. Billy's problem is that he must fight not only against bad obstacles and misunderstanding but also against strong social stereotypes. Several brilliant come scenes and bright humor greatly emphasize the struggles of the main hero. <br /> <br />Jamie Bell playing Billy has on of the best performances ever among young actors. His performance (and particularly dance sequences) is so genuine, bright and sincere that all the time we can easily feel an expression of a young boy, not a director, choreographer or writer. BAFTA award for best actor of the year is well-deserved and it is pity that conservatism of the Academy too often becomes an insuperable obstacle for many great movies. Julie Walters (an Academy nomination for best supporting actress) as Billy's ballet teacher also did a great job as a talented woman as a talented women who forced to teach in small provincial town for pitiful salary. The chemistry between teacher and student is another great line in Billy Elliot. Two other important supporting characters - Billy's father and elder brother Tony are also excellent and their evolution is perfectly showed by Stephen Daldry's direction. The beautiful soundtrack is a perfect combination of a classic (including a nice reference to great Swan Lake) and modern music. <br /> <br />The original \\"R\\" rating shouldn't mislead you. Except for strong language it should be easily a PG-13. But this is a very rare case where some strong language and profanity are necessary for authenticity and characters understanding. The movie is suitable for teens and it definitely is able to give some good lessons for them. <br /> <br />10 out of 10 looks well deserved. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English
B000HT386M|3.0|Personally, romantic comedies are critic-proof: you're not supposed to see some big character study epic a la films by Spielberg or Scorsese. What you're ultimately there to see is \\"was the film funny?\\" So do you mind that the same concept was used for Bruce Almighty? I didn't. I saw it for one reason: I want to laugh, and I will admit that I did on a few parts. But then there will be parts that just simply didn't fit or came out of left field and it becomes just a generic comedy with a few bright spots. <br /> <br />Michael Newman(Adam Sandler) is a young architect who's being overworked by his demanding boss(David Hasselhoff in another \\"so bad it's funny\\" roles). He cancels camping trips, forgets events with his kids and unbelievably, can't figure out what remote controls what. So he decides to get a universal remote but thanks to Morty, a quirky salesman(a delightful Christopher Walken), he now has a remote control that actually controls life itself. Dog's too loud? Mute it. Fight with the missus? Skip it. Feel like hitting your boss? Pause it and wail on him. Only, of course, the remote is \\"special\\" so it remembers Michael's attitude towards certain events and skips them without warning. Pretty soon he skips entire sections of his life and trying to figure out how to save his life while it's passing by. <br /> <br />Now for some good: the casting. Kate Beckinsale is just simply lovely, being a charming wife and still having some spunk and not that \\"ball and chain\\" feeling. And of course Chris Walken who acts like he knows it's a terrible movie and decides to just go with it. And Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner are memorable but their roles are just too small. As for Adam Sandler, well...it's kind of like a more tamer version of other comedy roles he's done but he still manages to go for kids swearing and a very horny dog with a thing for a plush duck doll. He kind of works but then he doesn't. <br /> <br />The film's tone is probably its biggest problem. Some ofthe laughs do work such as life based on a DVD menu complete with audio commentary by none other than James Earl Jones. Or when he decides to change his skin color from Hulk green to Barney purple. But other jokes such as farting, the aforementioned kid profanity or \\"kid getting hit by\\" jokes don't tend to work. Then the film becomes a complete morality play and we see Michael in the future reacting to missing chunks of his life and it becomes more drama than anything. Not to mention the ending is downright atrocious(save for a good use of a U2 song). <br /> <br />The main thing about this movie is this: can you stomach these kinds of movies, especially one who brought you such comedy \\"masterpieces\\" as Billy Madison or the Longest Yard? Hm, in the words of Oasis, definately maybe.
0393327345|4.0|Like most people here, I read the book after watching the movie.  I would've given it 5 stars if I didn't already know what was going to happen.  I won't recap the story here-it is something that should be experienced by you, and I don't want to give anything away.  I will say that I wished I had read it before I saw the movie.  There are differences between the book and the movie.  I really enjoyed the writing style.  Short, choppy sentences that hit you like a machine gun. I'd recommend you read this whether or not you've seen the movie.  It is a great read.  READ IT FIRST IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast may well be the very best animated film Disney ever produced.   The characterizations of the leads are great as we have the sweet book loving Belle and the the flawed but totally redeemable \\"Beast\\".  Gaston and Belle's father are also well drawn and memorable as are the comic relief bearing \\"enchanted\\" servants at the castle.   There's something for everyone as the story is so romantic it leaves a lot of grown up ladies sighing, the bad guys are not too scary for the little ones and for the rest it is just a great tale.  Plus Beauty and the Beast has some of the best songs ever written for a Disney production.  No wonder the Broadway musical has  been such a hit as well.
B00005JOQS|5.0|... which is very much how I feel about people who went to see this film expecting something straight out of the regular comics continuity(something more akin to BATMAN BEGINS), but unfortunately for them, this is in fact a continuation of the original Salkind/Spengler-produced series that, if we are to accept (and I happily do) to ignore the awful 3rd and 4th SUPERMAN films, and believe that the saga left off at the end of SUPERMAN II, the last film of that series that was truly a good film. This film pays homage, more than anything, to the work done by Richard Donner in the first two SUPERMAN films (That's right, I said the first TWO... because Donner was cut loose after filming approximately 70% of part 2) and the mythology of all of the screen incarnations, with Jack Larson (The old TV series' Jimmy Olsen) and Noel Neill (the serial's Lois Lane). That being said, this film is a joy to behold. It has heart and soul, some fantastic set pieces, and some of the most iconic imagery ever presented in a superhero film. Brandon Routh, coming in to fill the extremely large-sized boots of the late Christopher Reeve (who admittedly by pretty much everyone who ever either made or saw the previous films was born to play the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent) and he does an admirable job. He may look a little younger and a little slighter, but he does more in this film than just a Christopher Reeve impersonation (as he was essentially was accused of, which is a crock... the personae of Clark Kent/Superman was not created by Reeve, but merely perfected by him) and he does quite well. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor... I was very excited by this prospect since Spacey is one of the great working actors in film and stage now, and seeing him in this film, it only made the film stronger. His Lex is a little darker, and not quite as tongue-in-cheek as Gene Hackman's portrayal in the previous films, and he works the role to Spacey-esque proportions. The only real failing of casting in this film is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, and it has nothing to do with her level of talent since she is quite a talented actress. It does really have to do with her age... she seems impossibly young to play the grizzled, world-renowned, Pulitzer-winning intrepid reporter and mother. Erica Durance, who plays a much younger Lois Lane on the television show \\"Smallville\\" seems older than Bosworth and more than anything, Bosworth's young looks are more distracting as to take her out of the role. A misfire of casting though hardly diminishes the narrative and emotion of the scenes she plays with Routh, Spacey and the EXTREMELY underrated James Marsden as her fiance. The real star of this film though is its director, Bryan Singer, who helped Marvel prove that Superhero films could not only make money but be good as well with his work on the first two X-MEN films, and now has proved to DC that he can make Superman work again. The film takes well-paced breaks from the action that instead of hurting the flow, assist in the emotional investment. Singer is a director who is not afraid to take his time when dealing with characters. This was the only \\"blockbuster\\" film of the last summer that really gave you something worth your money, including a last moment homage to Reeve's portrayal that tugs heavily at the heartstrings and really does make you believe that a man can fly.film is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, and it has nothing to do with her level of talent since she is quite a talented actress.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Whatever the climate sceptics may say, don't believe them. See this for yourself. The science is solid, and the explanations are clear - and shocking. This is the most serious crisis we face on our planet, and one (alas) where the more you learn, the more you worry.<br /><br />I have worked on this issue for over ten years, including writing a major book on the solutions (Stormy Weather: 101 Solutions to Global Climate Change, New Society Publishers, 2001), and I have founded the BC Sustainable Energy Association to stimulate the new technologies and approaches that we need. I say this, so that you know I am truly committed, and serious.<br /><br />The solutions are all around us, in the form of wind, solar, tidal and biofuelled energy; electric vehicles, ten times greater energy efficiency, and a renaissance of communities designed so that it is easy, and pleasant, to walk, cycle, and use transit and railways. And shift to organic farming, sustainable forest management, and eating less meat.<br /><br />Why would we *not* want to embrace such a new energy revolution? It is only the lords of power in the big auto, oil and coal corporatins who tell us it can't be done, and whine about the cost. Give us a break! They are the wimps of modern capitalism, who have given up on the dream of humans being creative, smart, entrepreneurial, adaptive, and excited by a vision of change and hope.<br /><br />So please, buy this video, and organize a house-party to show all your friends, and discuss it together.

1594200823|5.0|I am a pharmacist who is also very interested in how diet and exercise maintain people's health.  Michael Pollan's book was an incredible eye-opener.  I first heard him interviewed on Science Friday on NPR news (podcast) and decided to read his book.  It is an extremely well researched book with an entire source list in the back.  It is also very entertaining and easy to read.  It is obvious he has a great sense of humor.  His book encompasses the economics, politics, biology, ecology, and physiology regarding our current american diet.  His book has surely changed the way I think about food and I was fairly well versed before I read his book.  Now, I am a member of a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) and have been spreading the word! This is one of the best and most influential books I have ever read. Everyone should read it.  Ignorance is not bliss.  Just ask some of my pharmacy customers who have side effects from the medicines they take and have to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars on those same medications.
B000F8O35U|5.0|We each have our own favorite Disney classic, this one happens to be mine.   <br /> <br />First off though, I want to thank Disney for bringing these classics back into our homes.  I missed the first DVD wave of disney's, which were apparently bad, and with this special Disney Platinum treatment, we get the very best, including with this edition of \\"The Little Mermaid\\". <br /> <br />I hadn't watched \\"The Little Mermaid\\" in forever.  It just kind of sat in a box full of Disney VHS movies in a closet. This DVD made me rediscover my all-time favorite Disney classic.  Seeing it again brought back everything as to why I loved it.  I loved the characters, especially Sebastian (Even at my age, I still find the scene with the cook in the kitchen hilarious). <br />And I still love it just as much today as I did 13 years ago. <br /> <br />As I watch it today, I think the reason is that it's the first Disney \\"Princess\\" movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.  The only ones that came before the Little Mermaid were Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White.  It's the first one that dares be hilarious with songs like \\"Les Poissons\\" graphically depicting the killing and preparation of a fish for dinner, and also pokes fun at humans with \\"Under the Sea\\".  Plus the underwater theme is used perfectly. <br />When I think about it, it was also kind of revolutionary as far as Disney's Princesses go : Ariel was the first one to have a prince with an actual name (aka Eric).  In the first three, the prince was always referred to as \\"Prince charming\\" if I'm not mistaken.   <br />I thought also that with the Little Mermaid, the dynamics changed between the girl and the prince (and thus paving the way for Beauty and The Beast).  He still had to go to great lengths to save Ariel, but unlike the other 3 previous Disneys, this one actually focused on the actual relationship between the two before the whole \\"damsel in distress\\" appears.  I also believe he's the first prince to be saved from a Disney Princess.   <br />I just think that it makes this Disney classic more approachable and relatable than the other ones. <br /> <br />In any case, here the Little Mermaid is beautifully restored (except for the staircase CGI makeover at one point).  It's a beautiful movie that's absolutely worth adding to your collection of Disney's.  Even as a \\"young\\" adult, I find that the magic is still there, the music is still just as catchy and amazing (It won 2 Oscars for Best Song and Best Original Music), and even after a number of viewings, it's one of those movies you can't get enough of and you'll always love to see again and again. <br />It's a must for any DVD collection. <br /> <br />Just as an afterword, if you haven't gotten your hands on the special edition dvd of \\"Bambi\\" and \\"Lady and The tramp\\", now's the time to do it because they're going back into the vault at the end of January 2007!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I watched and loved the series when it originally came out on VHS. A chance to meet Neil Armstrong and John Glenn this year prompted me to take another look. I consider this work the best mini-series of all time, which is perhaps biased, as I have read extensively about the space program and have been a big fan since attending a ticker-tape parade for John Glenn as a young boy.  <br /> <br />Both fans of the Apollo program and general movie watchers who enjoy human drama and have even a speck of interest in the historical aspects of Apollo should be well satisfied. Tom Hanks pulled together an exceptional work, as his team hit the highlights and the details at key moments, with enough other offbeat and background moments to add to the entertainment (one that comes to mind is Pete Conrad's instructions to his team to do their business before they headed in for the lunar landing). The score fits well, and the occasional pop number reminds the viewer how (unfortunately) long ago these events were.  <br /> <br />Given that Apollo 11 is only around the midpoint of the series, Hanks was up to the challenge of maintaining momentum after the early climax. Focus shifted from the flights themselves to alternative themes. Apollo 12 highlighted the free-spirited Pete Conrad and the luckiest moonwalker of them all, Al Bean. Apollo 13 obviously could not re-do the movie that was relatively new at the time, and remains popular. The summary was reasonable, with the emphasis on the career conflict among the newsmen just OK, and probably the weakest of all the segments. Apollo 14 had the return of Al Shepard, and 15's episode was a solid detour into the rise of scientific objectives and the change in astronauts' thinking. Once again the astronauts showed their exceptional talents, and another part of the gigantic support structure showed its value, besides the usual Mission Control crowd.  <br /> <br />The Spider/Apollo 9 episode and the Apollo 8 episode may be my favorites.  Apollo11 was of course well done, but I am so familiar with the landing and its issues, that it was unable to surprise me much. However, the connection of Apollo 8 to 1968 and Apollo 9 to the creation of the LEM were both clever and solid storytelling that wonderfully mixed the technical and personal.  <br /> <br />Kudos also go to the story about the wives in the 11th episode. The families largely disappeared after the early segments, with the exception of Apollo 13, and Hanks was smart to round out the series with another round of human interest.  <br /> <br />Feel free to watch them over an extended period, sampling them occasionally. The episodes stand on their own quite well, or in groups.
1400034779|3.0|After reading a lot of good reviews -- and having a friend recommend the book as well -- I was expecting much more than the book delivered.  First, the book isn't a \\"detective\\" book; second, the cover blurb says the main character is \\"put in danger\\" and that never truly happens; third, I guess I was looking for a little more insight into the culture of Botswana in the vein of Tony Hillerman and that was not supplied either.  The writing is good but the hype leading up to my getting the book certainly led me to expect something totally different.  Hence, I have to rate this book as \\"Average.\\"
B000GUJHD0|3.0|A Whole New Mind is the kind of book that many life coaches will love. Pink presents ideas that will reassure us we can have fun while reaching success. Creativity wins. Meaning matters more than money. Your job (and even your industry) could be automated or exported out of existence.<br /><br />This book reminds me of newspaper articles about \\"new jobs for aging boomers,\\" where the fine print describes a few boomers in exceptional circumstances who continued their jobs, rather than moved to new ones. Or we get warned about \\"shortage of management talent,\\" but thousands of managers can't find jobs.<br /><br />Similarly Pink optimistically reports evidence that we're moving to a more creative, right-brained society. Executives attend seminars on humor and story-telling. Design is used to differentiate me-too products.<br /><br />But for the most part, corporate jobs and rewards continue to accrue to the left-brained. Maybe a few top execs at a few companies go to seminars on story-telling. The rest of the employees get measured on hard numbers and are lucky if they find time to tell bedtime stories to their kids.<br /><br />Another example: Pink identifies medical training aimed to create kindlier, more empathic doctors. But in reality, once physicians are forced into managed care systems with mandated 7-minute consultations, they're lucky to find time for a civil \\"Good morning.\\"<br /><br />Pink's book seems targeted to a comfortable segment of the population -- those who have done well but are just now feeling restless and ready for more meaningful lives. They want to believe the world is moving in the direction Pink describes.<br /><br />But they're a minority and they don't seem to have a lot of power. Most of our institutions remain stuck in 19th century hierarchical left-brained systems: education, government, health care, justice and more. The Wall Street Journal just reported (October 14, 2006) a trend in philanthropy favoring disease and hunger, not the arts.<br /><br />I really liked Pink's book Free Agent Nation so I was optimistic for A Whole New Mind. I suspect many who are forced into the Free Agent Nation yearn for a world that rewards the Whole New Mind. Alas...we might do better to practice creativity in what's left of our free time rather than try to imagine a right-brain dominated world at work.er, not the arts.  <br /> <br />I really liked Pink's book Free Agent Nation so I was optimistic for A Whole New Mind.

However, I have to say that some of the examples he gives look like writing from books I have read and others look like good ideas that a little polishing could make an award winning book.  (Although I must admit that, as a reader, I generally don't care much for award winning books!)  At any rate, the ideas expounded by the author are good.

I would say that the remainder of the album may be appreciated by true musicians because of the complex guitar playing, keyboard, and the mixing together of this. But everyone else won't really appreciate the other songs. Sometimes you listen to an album which has a hit and some of the other songs are really good and we think, \\"That song is so catchy that it could have been a hit, too.\\" Well, not the rest of \\"Avalon\\". I would consider it filler (just fine as far as the record company goes and understandably so.)The remainder is good to listen to while washing the dishes.
B000GY729M|5.0|The Killers intergrated a new version of rock with their 2004 debut album \\"Hot Fuss.\\"<br /><br />They mixed together 80's new-wave and dance to create one tasty treat.<br /><br />On this, their second full-length studio album, the Killers flex their muscles and show us that they've got some new ideas up their sleves.<br /><br />The lyrics have matured, and lead singer Brandon Flowers' vocals have given a bit to unearth a more powerful, yet tender voice.<br /><br />With each song he takes you on a journey; telling an incredible story.<br /><br />From the sweeping, epic sound of \\"Sam's Town\\" and \\"Bling (Confessions of a King)\\", to the heartbreaking refrains on \\"For Reasons Unknown, Read My Mind\\" and \\"Why Do I Keep Counting?\\"<br /><br />Each song has tough guitar riffs, gritty drums and amazing melodies.  The new tunes also showcase a bit of Americana muscle.  This is even evident on the tracks \\"The River is Wild\\" and \\"Bones.\\"<br /><br />Whether you want to listen to this album for great rock 'n' roll songcraft, to be consoled or lulled peacfully, or simply because of the interesting cover art, one thing is certain:<br /><br />The Killers do not disappoint.
0920236251|1.0|This is the tiniest book ever, and I did not realize that before my purchase. I thought I was getting the regular size paperback, not the 2inch by 2 inch copy. Check before you buy...... I was not informed and the listing does not give that information. What a let down.
0312330537|5.0|The first thing you notice about the book is size; the sheer volume of 1,000 pages seems daunting. However midway through the book, I was wishing that the book was 2,000 pages long. There is no definite plot to this book, yet it engrossed me from the first page. The pages are full of crackle of life that Bombay lives every day. Gregory brings out the best and worst of Bombay in this book. He walks us through the slums, lepers, jails, mosques, and the ganglands of Bombay. He enlivens all the characters that surround him. The only fault I can find is that he complicates the character of mentor Abdul Kader Khan to an extent that it is hard to figure out what the author is really trying to portray. The character of Karla similarly fails to make good sense througout the book. <br /> <br />Other than these minor problems, the book travels calmly with the life of an escaped convict. It is an epic, clearly a book with a lot of years in the making. Now that Gregory Roberts has written a book based on his life, I'll be curiosuly awaiting his next book which he will not base on his previous adventures. He does have a great talent of narration, and is an author worth watching for in the future.
B000HIVQLW|4.0|A 2-CD, 26 track, 2 1/2 hours compilation of Floyd's repertoire. Sure, it's nice to once again relive tunes like the trippy &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;, &quot;See Emily Play&quot;, the pulsating &quot;Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun&quot;, &quot;Sheep&quot;, &quot;One Of These Days&quot;, &quot;Learning To Fly&quot; and the quirky Syd Barrett's (R.I.P.) &quot;Bike&quot;. Even though several of these cuts have been edited down to fit on the CD, I thought that was a good thing. Most fans should have all these songs anyway. For the completists, die-hards or any new patrons that have never owned a Pink Floyd record before.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|If I were John Mayer's manager, I would have inadvertently ruined his career. Once he hit the charts with the terrific pop song, \\"No Such Thing,\\" I would have insisted that he stay the course and keep writing pop songs. All of that blues-guitar stuff that he toiled with for the past few years? I would have advised him that he was angling for an audience that would never accept him on their terms, while ostracizing the teenaged girls who liked his songs and thought he was cute (and who could care less about his guitar playing abilities). Why aim for credibility when the pop music yellow brick road could lead you to a pot of riches?<br /><br />Thank God I wasn't around to screw him up with bad advice. It must be incredibly rewarding to earn the respect of Buddy Guy and Herbie Hancock, and to show the world that you are a multi-faceted human being with talent that goes beyond the superficialities of commercial pop music. My bad advice apparently knows no bounds, though, because I definitely would not have approved of \\"Continuum\\" either. Seeing as how he was teetering on the brink of two distinctly different images, I would have insisted that he make an album that tied them together. I definitely would not want him to re-release studio versions of tracks that already appeared on his live album (both \\"Gravity\\" and \\"Vultures\\" reappear here). Instead, Mayer made an album that is uniquely his own. It is neither a pop record nor a blues record. \\"Continuum\\" is as understated an album as I've heard in a very long time, and it defied all of my expectations. Is Mayer brave? Indifferent? Crazy? No, he's not crazy. He's just a LOT smarter than I am when making his career decisions, because \\"Continuum\\" is the type of album that will last a lot longer than any trend.<br /><br />This isn't the type of album that jumps out at you, grabs you by the neck and demands your attention. There is no obvious hit here, and if you don't pay attention, you might miss the details that make this record shine. On a casual listen, \\"I Don't Trust Myself\\" could be any other seduction tune with a mellow groove. Listen closely, though, and the details emerge. Isn't that one of the coolest, slinkiest horn charts you've ever heard?  \\"Stop This Train\\" is as graceful and gorgeous a reflection about ageing as I've ever heard, but you could miss it if you underestimate Mayer's artistry. `Subtle' is the key word, and there's a mellow yet fulfilling depth to all of his writing here. As the saying goes, still waters run deep, and Mayer finds the essence of his artistry by writing personally about topics of universal interest. He addresses the dangers of apathy in \\"Waiting for the World to Change,\\" then debates the negative connotations of blind faith in \\"Belief.\\" Does that sound like the work of a pop songwriter, or the lyrical expression of a blues player? Sting can only dream of writing something so personally effective, and Eric Clapton only wishes he could write an album this poignant. So, a note to John Mayer's manager - good job, dude. And a note to John, too - fantastic job, mate. \\"Continuum\\" will certainly be remembered as one of the best albums of 2006. Finally, note to self - stay away from artist management.  A Tom Ryanne.

B000HEWEE4|1.0|I can say it all in one word: BORING!  This movie is short.  About 90 minutes.  Seems like 3 hours.  It moves at a snails pace.  I do not recommend this movie unless you need help going to sleep!
B00008PW2D|3.0|I'm a HUGE FAN of the \\"Sex and the City\\" series, BUT feel gipped that season 5 only had 8 episodes......

0393327655|2.0|while I looked forward to reading this I was immediately disappointed to discover that the author is in fact<br /><br />a self-confessed meditator, interested in the spiritual and/or mental offerings of Buddhism, in particular. I read some interviews with him elsewhere and there was often a tolerance for the Eastern traditions of religion (which he tries to rescue as philosophies). But those religions are faith-based and often full of all kinds of metaphysical babble (reincarnation, superpower spiritual teachers), including the Dalai Lama.<br /><br />so, if you're really anti-spiritual and are looking for kindred authors I would steer you away from this author.<br /><br />some of us have had enough of all the religions of the world. Richard Dawkins is far better and less hypocritical.
B000HCO8IQ|4.0|Back for their sophomore release, Scissor Sisters take The Beatles, The Bee Gees, Elton John and Queen, and they twist them into a unique, contemporary dancefest. This is the type of music they don't make anymore. It's interesting how well Scissor Sisters capture the 1970's in their music, with just a dash of The Smiths and Duran Duran from the 1980's.<br /><br />\\"Ta-Dah\\" just misses being perfect due to duds like \\"She's My Man\\", \\"Lights\\", \\"Kiss You Off\\" and \\"Everybody Wants The Same Things\\". The hits are plenty, beginning with the first single, and Bee Gees/Elton John flavored \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\". Why this single isn't getting more airplay is absolutely criminal. This song is easily a #1 hit. This is the travesty of the music business these days. Other potential singles could be \\"Ooh\\", \\"Paul McCartney\\", \\"The Other Side\\", \\"Might Tell You Tonight\\" and \\"Land Of A Thousand Words\\". Scissor Sisters even offer up a little Broadway in \\"I Can't Decide\\" and \\"Intermission\\".<br /><br />Overall, \\"Ta-Dah\\" solidifies what Scissor Sisters began on their 2004 debut. This is a band to watch, and superstardom could be just around the corner.

0060825219|5.0|This is a very interesting read if you like the Post-Modern, quasi-deconstructive feel. He is now a very famous writer and no longer is merely telling tales. Now he telling tales about telling tales and about him telling talkes. He is know revealing his process and his thoughts. Most of the novel is filled with brilliant asides, interesting conversations (although his women are really men that somehow give vaginal sex), and concepts that mean something. What is always great about Coelho is that he is really saying something meaningful. Maybe that's why there are stacks upons stacks of his books in every bookstore. If you're looking for classic Coelho, this book may not be your first choice, but it's still a great book.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|On the whole I actually like the songs better on this CD than on Fallen.  Maybe because I haven't heard them all a bazillion times already, but this album offers a little more variety.  It's still roughly the same sound, but better. <br />The guitars on the first album always bugged me in their repetition and lack of range. This has been \\"fixed\\" a bit with the new fella. I'd still like to hear a little more than the predominant power chords. <br />The strongest song is probably Good Enough, a piano ballad the ends the album.  A couple other good tracks are Sweet Sacrifice, Lacrymosa, and Like You. <br />A big gripe I have with this CD, something that caused me to drop it from 4 to 3, is the production.  The music suffers from lack of dynamics due to poor production, in my mind.  When the band kicks in everything is jammed up to the top together, making it sound like a big jumbled mess.  This isn't all that uncommon anymore, but it's really annoying.
B000HA4W4S|5.0|This CD makes me so happy!  It's like the Sisters took all the little soundbites from a late-night TV commercial selling a definitive \\"Music of the 70's (and maybe the very early 80's)\\" collection - you know the ones where you just hear the title of the song as the other song titles are scrolling by and the one you're hearing becomes blue or green or whatever color the other ones are not? - so they took all those 'bites from Helen Reddy and the Partridge Family and Leo Sayer and Pink Floyd and Blondie and they scrunched them all up into a marshmallow-like ear-pleasing spongy fluid and made a CD out of it. It's so dang cool!  Favorite lyric of the year... \\"I can't decide whether you should live or die... you'll probably go to heaven, please don't hang your head and cry.\\"  I have a couple of coworkers whose voice evokes the rampant humming of thatline inside my head.

It is a losing argument for atheists.

0552550299|4.0|Stop your browsing and buy this book. Jonathon Stroud gives the world of fantasy his own unique twist. In his world magicians cast spells to do various ne'er do well deeds, but the spells don't magically go out to do their business. No, the magicians must work through a second party namely an imp or a djinni or an afrit or some other creatively named creature. The creature does the biding of the magician. The creature also has a mind and a will of its own. So part of the fun of this book is the tug of war between the magicians and the creatures. The spotlight magician in this book is a young boy named Nathaniel. He summons a creature named Bartimaeus. Bartimaeus is a wise-cracking, sarcastic, drippingly funny sideman who is the energy in this book. So stop browsing and buy this book.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|I remember my first kiss, where I was when Princess Di died, and the first time I heard the song that changed my life. I was sat in the car waiting for my big brother to give me a lift to my friends house, so I switched on the radio. Lucky enough to catch the end of `Everlong' by Foo Fighters. I'd lived and breathed rock music for a good few years before that moment, hell, I was even at this point in a band. But somehow I'd managed to completely miss the story so far, of Dave Grohl and the ever changing line up of the fighters of Foo. I made my big bro buy me the album for my birthday. Pretty soon I was an obsessive fan. It was often an in joke between me and friends as to just how obsessed I was. Awaiting every album with Swiss quartz precision. It became a military manoeuvre to get a new release before every human possible. (Now due to downloading this has become impossible.) but when I heard that the Foo Fighters were planning a double album- Yes- a double album, my heart skipped.  <br />It was a day off and there was thud on the floor from the doorway of my Gospel Oak flat. I knew what it was immediately. After the hit and miss disappointment of `one by one' I had high hopes as I was already won over by the session of new material I saw on Jools Holland, Best of You and Razor. No Way Back was classic Foo material, so I was pumped. I made sure I'd pre-ordered the maxi pack special edition with the additional DVD, despite the lack of an extra exclusive 11th track on disc 1. I wanted the luxury package. Was my faith restored two hours later? The result was a moderately troubled, half smile. As always it's good to hear anything by the fellas of Foo. But something didn't quite work. It took me some time to put my finger on it but eventually it hit. <br />The album is backwards. The first half: one loud. Too over the top. With half classic Foo material. (Like `one by one') the first five are essential material, but the second half were b-sides. Filler. And the seconddisk: one not so loud. Beautiful on there own but way to light to stand up to the sheer planet sized bombast of side one. The only way an album like this is able to work is to play side two then side one. And skip a couple of the heavy tracks.  <br />I thought about the events leading up to the recording and release of the album, Dave had gone on record as saying. (Paraphrasing) He wanted the album to be to the Foo Fighters, what Physical Graffiti was to the Zep. Problem is, he got what he wanted. PG was a collection of out takes from earlier Zep sessions. Good moments, but not quite the flawless classic that My Hero Dave was convinced it was. He also seemed to be making an album split in personality. One reflecting what his fans wanted to hear, and one that would please his people close to him. Thus pleasing no one entirely. I don't doubt the inclusion of Norah Jones was a suggestion emanating from someone else's CD collection. Within disk 2 is also where Dave seems most comfortable. The joyous `Cold Day In The Sun' (In which Dave is relegated to drum duties whilst Taylor takes on the wailing.) bounces along with ease, `Over and Out' is given added importance of John Paul Jones' inclusion, as well as the haunting beauty of Josh Homme on closer `Razor`. He just seems out his signature heavier ideas. <br />Disk one has some great potential. 'The deepest Blues Are Back' is a fantastic song, but the recording and production seem to jar with what could have been a highlight, possibly 'heavied up' so as to fit onto disk one more comfortably, but instead we have a difficult sound, like a college rock band trying to out piss Metallica with Simon and Garfunkle covers. Shoe horning it in direction it just didn't want to go.   <br />My advice, Dave, you are the king of modern rock, the cool older brother we look to, to know what makes a sincere and thoughtful, intelligent rock star with power to make music that makes us sweat and gives a lump in the throat in equal measure. But you need direction, and have great music within you. But a three star effort could have been a five star masterpiece, if only it was better executed and better thought through. Take time out and make some softer albums for a bit. But be true to who you are musically. Only when he's writing for himself will we see another Everlong... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I have to be honest, I didn't expect much from this album. I thought \\"TRY\\" was incredibly difficult to get through and mostly messy (though there were flashes of brilliance). I ordered this one based on my sadly obsessive need for new music. To say that I was pleasnantly surprised is an understatement. This record absolutely blew me away. There is nothing too poppy here, but there is also nothing that is overpowering like most of \\"TRY\\". What we have here are 12 cuts that make most of today's music look like childs play. <br /> <br />A smart move was made in putting single and most upbeat track \\"Waiting On The World To Change\\" at the beginning. Its extraordinarily catchy and will stay in your head after a single listen. The radio has sadly ignored this track when it deserves to be getting more airplay than any single John has ever released. Two of my favorite tracks off \\"TRY\\", \\"Gravity\\" and \\"Vultures\\" are here, with appropriate amounts of studio polish added. By this point my fears have been mostly silenced, though I still am wishing for those excellent ballads John can bust out (like \\"Wheel\\" and \\"Split Screen Sadness\\" from \\"Heavier Things\\"), but have not fear. The ballads here are as great as ever. There are two acoustic ballads, \\"Heart of Life\\" and \\"Stop This Train\\" that mostly gravitate towards folk pop, but there is still a bluesy flavor to them. The real highlights come in the second half of the album. \\"Slow Dancing In A Burning Room\\" is absolutely incredible, both lyrically and vocally, perhaps the best on the album. \\"Dreaming With A Broken Heart\\", John's first piano ballad, is equally impressive, and another favorite. My personal favorite track is \\"I'm Gonna Find Another You\\", a great soulful ballad, right down to the trumpets in the background. Its a great way to close out the album, though its over far too quickly. <br /> <br />But the great tracks don't stop there. \\"Belief\\" offers up an ice cool beat, and a great lyric (\\"We're never gonna win the world/ we're never gonna stop the war/ we're never gonna beat this if belief is what we're fighting for\\"). \\"In Repair\\" is a good bridge between the sounds of \\"Dreaming\\" and \\"Gonna Find\\". I have to admit that \\"Bold As Love\\" really did blow me away. There are certainly people who would laugh at the idea of John Mayer trying to cover Jimi Hendrix, but I laugh at the fact that he really pulls it off. Sure, its not as good as the original, but the guitar is DEAD ON AMAZING! It's nice to see John utilizing his incredible guitar skills (and he does so all over the album), because he's likely the best guitarist of his generation. <br /> <br />This album is completely flawless and completely addictive. I've found it hard to listen to much else for the past week, something that happens to me with only the very best albums. At best, this album is a huge improvement over anything previous in John's career and one of the best of 2006. At worst, its still amazing. Go buy it. I guarantee you won't regret it.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I watched the entire movie with my mouth open, glued to the screen. (Well, almost :) ). I have never before, and not afterwards, found a movie that was quite as good as this one in terms of captivation, plot, and the idea. The story sucks you in, and your brain is working the entire movie trying to figure out exactly what's going on. On my first take, I didn't quite get the outcome, so it took me some time and watching it again to really figure it out. Since the first viewing, I've watched the movie many times and, suprisingly, found something new every time. And I still watch it with the same feeling of suspense and interest. There are so many different ideas presented in the movie -- about the inconsistency of \\"reality\\", about being used in others plans, about knowing who you are... This movie is truly a genius production, a masterpiece.     The basic plot is about a guy who has an amnesia-like disability, where he does not remember immediate past events. The story progress backwards (!) from the end, and this technique makes you see the main character's predicament and frustration with not being able to remember or understand what's happening to him. (Except we, as the viewer, are able to see the 'future' and know what will happen to him next!)     I thought the actors were great, the director did a great job and, to quit raving about this movie, I have to say that it's simply SUPERB. Watch it and you won't be dissapointed.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|THE MOVIE<br /><br />\\"Star Wars - Episode IV: A New Hope\\" is, without a doubt, one of the greatest science-fiction films of our time. It's combination of great performances, awesome visual effects, fantastic action sequences, and stirring music combined to create a tour-de-force of the sci-fi genre. George Lucas succeeded in creating a science fiction film that's not only believable, but full of emotion as well. You care for the characters, and are not just enthralled with the specatcular space battles. This is the heart of \\"Star Wars,\\" and what makes it a milestone in the pantheon of American film!<br /><br />THE SPECIAL EDITION<br /><br />Unlike most others, I really enjoyed the Special Edition of \\"Star Wars.\\" With the new digital technology, we got to see the full realization of Lucas' vision. Mos Eisley is now a bustling spaceport; the explosions are even more impressive than before; and the final battle at the end is truly spectacular. What's most fascinating of all is how the new visual effects from 1997 blend well with the older effects from 1977. Lucas only fixed what needed to be fixed, and it makes the experience more exciting than ever before.<br /><br />THE LIMITED EDITION DVD<br /><br />When I heard the rumor that Lucas intended to release the 1977 Theatrical Version of the film, I decided to wait before purchasing the films. And the wait was definitely worth it! Both versions of the film are presented with fantastic sound and picture quality. And while the extras are light, just the fact that both versions of the film are available makes it more than worth it.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />The Limited Edition 2-Disc Set of \\"Star Wars - Episode IV: A New Hope\\" is a fantastic release for one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Even if you own the 4-Disc boxed-set, the fact that the original version of the film is available makes it worth buying this edition as well. As a \\"Star Wars\\" fan, I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+
B000H0MKOC|2.0|can a movie satire about a murderous industry that kills thousands of people every year be pleasant? this movie is. it's basically a lite comedy with no real bite. the actors are all good and the story's mildly amusing but no one in the movie is ever seen smoking. a satire about the tobacco industry and no one is smoking! i didn't read the novel the movie's based on, so i don't know if it's stronger but this movie's very weak and disappointing. you might almost think the tobacco industry was composed of decent people. everybody lies right? is that the message of this movie? the tobacco industry has knowingly killed millions of its customers. how funny or amusing is that?
0156012197|5.0|So of course my senior quote was, \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\"  Because I knew that in order to create my ideal life, I would have to follow the best advice Saint-Exupery offers us in this book.  And I knew that he was sharing the secret of life with us.  Following your heart, following the path that you know is right for your soul, is the way to achieve inner peace.  Your heart always shows you the right way.  Especially when you are lost.<br /><br />The journey of The Little Prince reminds us that change is inevitable and necessary for our lives to evolve into the lives we want to live.  The lamplighter reminded me that it's so important to fully experience every moment of life and appreciate everything we have.  Because it all can change in an instant.  The fox wants to show us why true love means never having to give up your freedom.  And then there's the rose...  Each character teaches us incredible lessons about love, friendship, strength, and altruism.  All of which are important when you're traveling along the path to self-actualization.<br /><br />There is no such thing as being too old to read this book.  I recommend it to everyone who wants to be the best human being they can be.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Here we go again....another tortured collection of three chord, twelve barre Delta Blues. In truth, these songs were redundant and whiny when the very limited Robert Johnson first recorded them; now hearing Clapton ressurect them is just plain annoying. How many times can we hear \\"I woke up this morning, baby; My cow just up and died.....da dum, da dum, da dum.....I woke up this morning, baby. My cow just up and died. Da dum, da dum, da dum.... So I drank a bottle of hooch and I began to cry....da dum, da dum, da dum....\\" Come on, people! If this is genius songwriting and guitar playing then we should all simply throw in the towel on civilization. When Eric Clapton plays Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, and Rogers and Hart on his guitar---unaccompanied----chords, melody and bass line----like Django Reinhardt, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Pass----then maybe I'll consider him a great guitarist. Today's youth are clueless about almost everything, and guitar virtuosity is no exception. I don't believe Clapton has ever heard of key modulation, arpeggios, or chord substitutions. In truth, he is an average rock guitarist, and considering the primative structure of rock and roll guitar playing, that's not saying much. For anyone to call him a great guitarist, let alone the greatest guitarist whoever lived, is indicative of either juvenile delinquency or just plain stupidity. It's like saying Madonna is the greatest singer of all time. Odds are those who make such vacuous, ludicrous statements are the children or grandchildren of the druggie Woodstock generation who wouldn't know a great guitarist if he/she tripped over him (which would be likely since they were all drugged out of their minds most of the time). I know we're living in the age of grand mediocrity, but enough is enough. Go buy a Wes Montgomery, Django Reinhardt or Barney Kessel album and listen to sophisticated, nuanced, and soulful guitar viruosity. If you have half a brain, you'll throw away your collection of rock guitar icons and beg foregiveness for being such an uneducated, unsophisticated nitwit who once claimed that one-dimensional druggies like Clapton and Hendrix were great guitarists. If after listening to these truly talented guitarists who actually play more than three chords you still hold to your position that Clapton is a great guitarist, here's what you do: pick up your Fender Strat, turn the amp volume up to 10, smoke a joint, and go stick your head between your distortion chambers and fuzz boxes and make a lot of noise and pretend you too are a great guitarist. Eric Clapton is a great guitarist! What a dumb society we have wrought since the late 1960s.

B00005JPAD|5.0|Martin Scorsese has another major hit on his hands with the release of the intelligent, chilling, violent, puzzling, and completely fascinating THE DEPARTED.  This viewer has not seen the INFERNAL AFFAIRS on which this film is based so comparisons are not possible.  But taking this film solely on its own merits this is one gripping piece of cinematic art.  Beginning with a very smart script by William Monahan (apparently based on the original screenplay by Siu Fai Mak) and employing one of the best ensemble casts of the year, Scorsese does what he does best in giving us a film that holds our attention, our breath, and our applause throughout.<br /><br />The story involves two young recently graduated from police academy, men from opposite sides of the law and backgrounds, who are made moles within the Boston State Police department and the Irish mafia: Leonardo DiCaprio is one and Matt Damon is the other and both young actors turn in committed and convincing performances.  On the polar aspects of the battleground are Jack Nicholson as the crime king Costello (his finest work since 'A Few Good Men') together with Ray Winstone as Mr French and on the other end are DiCaprio's mentors Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg and Damon's mentors Alec Baldwin et al.  The very beautifully written female lead is played to perfection by Vera Farmiga who finally has a role (a conflicted psychiatrist for the moles) hat takes full advantage of her prodigious gifts as an actress.<br /><br />Some may find the violence obsessively graphic, but then this is Scorcese's style and for this viewer it is necessary for the drive of the story.  It is impossible to stop concentrating for a moment during this rapid fire drama, spiced with just the right amount of wry humor, making its running time (in excess of two and a half hours) speed by as fast as the many bullets in the atmosphere.  This is one of Scorsese's best films and one that begs to be seen again.  Grady Harp, October 06> <br />

B000I2IT44|5.0|I own over 30 live music videos and Arriving Somewhere is the best I've seen... hands down... for the film work and editing. It shows the true power of the band and the energy of their music. Anyone who watches this DVD will be blown away by the quality.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|I love the fact that this film, one of my personal favorites and a film that made me fall in love with epics, is finally being released on DVD.  I remember growing up embracing any film that was long (David Lean was also a personal favorite), and this is one that I've always loved.  It's intelligent, thought provoking, articulate, well acted, directed, and just about everything else.  It harks back to a time when Hollywood studios would take a chance and make an interesting, complex film.  It runs 195 minutes, but it feels short, because it's so outstanding.  I really liked the political discussions in the film.  The characters of the film really believed in what they were saying, especially John Reed (Beatty) and Emma Goldman (played by Maureen Stapleton).  Despite the fact that their idealism was short lived, you feel their passion.  You also feel sympathy for Eugene O'Neil (played by Jack Nicholson).  It turns out his cynical attitude towards politics was correct.  Hollywood studios should realise that you can make films like this along with your usual assembly ones.  Not everything should be dumbed down to the level of horny teenage boys.  This is epic moviemaking at its finest, and I'm estatic that it's finally being released on DVD.
B000002AH7|5.0|Another reviewer, El Legarto, is crazy.  This album is absolute brilliance.  I believe it to be one of the most underrated albums of all time for the simple fact that anyone finds any fault with it.  Its different, and that should be seen as a good thing.  He also called Miles a druggy and arrogant.  He was a druggy that twice kicked his drug habbit, the second time for good, and he was so arrogant that he always gave his band mates creative license and freedom to express themselves and give input on recordings.  His band mates traditionally carried this humility to their own expiriences as big band leaders.  This album is creative and fun to listen to, and a must buy for jazz fans.
B000G8NY4U|2.0|I've always been on the border with Yanni. I had hope this DVD would help. It did not. If you really like Yanni you will probably like this DVD. If not go elsewhere.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Why does Hamlet delay? I consider this play a dramatic warning of what inevitably happens when a man fails to believe in the truth of his desire. Hamlet doubts, talks, fails; Fortinbras believes, is silent, conquers. This play's life lesson, then, is DARE to believe in the truth of your desires. Always be Fortinbras; avoid being Hamlet. Put differently, \\"Your feelings will never lead you astray\\".    To potential buyers of this DVD:    UPSIDE  1. The dialogue is the complete Hamlet from all editions of the play.  2. Branagh's performance is majestical fire.  3. The set, the costumes, the dialogue - all beautiful.    DOWNSIDE  1. Ironically, a weakness is the classic \\"To be or not to be\\" soliloquy. Branagh attempts to emotionally color this moment with eerie background music throughout the soliloquy, but his delivery feels too controlled. It requires a more reflective quality than Branagh imparts: Hamlet has crossed the Rubicon, his unconscious fury erupting into his conscious mind. The mad-playing Hamlet discovers he really has strayed into madness, and under the shocks of what he's faced - murdered father, adulterous mother, vicious uncle, betrayal of all friends (but one, Horatio), confrontation with a ghost - this surely is no surprise. This too is the moment Hamlet realizes he's failed to DARE to believe in the truth of his desire and in so doing mired his soul. This psychologically deep soliloquy can also be seen simply as a cold-blooded and pretty astute assessment of the whole nasty \\"down side\\" of life; ie, \\"Enough's enough\\". But Branagh doesn't convincingly touch one or the other key. Instead, his \\"To be\\" comes off more like a creaky Shakespearean \\"blue note\\" - a jazz note played \\"between the keys\\".    2. Act I scene 3: Laertes' farewell to his sister Ophelia. This scene fails. The weakness is inexcusable. Michael Maloney (playing Laertes) is a fine actor more than capable of fulfilling the requirements of this scene. Branagh should have focused far far moreprecisely here because Laertes is a central foil (the other being Fortinbras) to Hamlet. Yet the impression we receive of Laertes here, under Branagh's direction, is of a doofus showing off his foppish erudition to his innocent and impressionable sister via cloying fistfuls of gummy platitudes. Unfortunate. This is our sole opportunity to gauge, know, and respect Laertes before his vengeful return and transformation following his father's death, and Branagh - to my mind - clearly has wasted (one might say violated) this sole opportunity to breathe depth, life, and dramatic force into Laertes. (The fall of a good man with a gifted mind delivers considerably more dramatic impact than the fall of an immature fop.) This wasted opportunity dampens Laertes' dramatic force later in the play and therefore hamstrings the play itself. (If you doubt this and already have the DVD, reexamine this scene and judge for yourself.)    3. Another downside is the \\"Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest\\" scene. Try to imagine coming across a graveyard then finding yourself holding in your hand the skull of a beloved childhood friend in your hand. \\"My gorge rises at it.\\" Not Branagh's apparently though. Branagh just doesn't pull this off well. It's more like he came across an old pet's skull. In fact, it doesn't seem to affect him even that much. This scene is in fact, to my mind, the entire hinge of the play. Confronting death face to face. Branagh just can't grab it by the roots.    Downsides aside, this film is a *marvelous* conjunction of our greatest English playwright and (perhaps) our most perceptive modern dramatist in what I consider to be the best version of Hamlet ever produced.

B000HIVO64|5.0|I have always thought Beck's albums were impeccably produced and of the highest class sonically and musically. I love the Information's spacy feeling and believe that Beck has created a modern day Ziggy Stardust type album, complete with all sorts of futuristic effects and space motifs. Like Ziggy Stardust, not all the songs are \\"spacy\\", but enough are to keep a similar feel. While a disaffected rock star may not be at the center of the Information (at least within the album's story line), Beck has created a much more mature and nuanced album based on the disaffection and isolation of the \\"information Age\\". I definitely see a Bowie/Eno connection with Beck/Godrich. Next they need to get to Berlin and make the \\"Dark\\" album(or does Sea Change cover it?)...
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Given that the movie is wonderful, perhaps the last of the great Hollywood musicals and a charmer for all generations, this DVD is still remarkably wonderful. Disney has done a clean-up job on the film that makes it shine. The audio is rich and wonderful, including the all-important ORIGINAL stereo soundtrack (feh to multi-channel remixes!). The special features even manage to elucidate the process of filmmaking in manner intriguing to both the cineaste parent and Mary-mad children.<br /><br />Though my TV screen is significantly smaller than 1964 theater screens, I can't imagine that Mary Poppins looked or sounded any better when it was new. A bravura DVD of an excellent family entertainment!!!
B0007939NO|3.0|Musicals cover a huge range, from the serious thought provoking productions like Cabaret (and if you don't think a musical can have a serious outcome consider the fact that the German government edited out the song \\"Tomorrow belongs to me\\" because they felt it might inflame those with neo-nazi proclivities) to those that fill a need within people to believe in a beautiful story ( witness the fact that millions tuned in to BBC T.V. to find out who would play Maria in the new West End production by Andrew Lloyd Weber). Brigadoon falls in the middle and comes from that glorious era of Hollywood mega musicals. It epitomises everything that critics complain about when they discuss the Hollywoodisation of the world. The highlands of Scotland were never like this, the accents are hoochter, choochter nonsense, the kilts are embarrasingly bright, in fact the whole production is in Ansco, a film process that relegates gaudy to the dim recesses of dull. The performers walk about with glazed looks on their faces, even the sensational Cyd Charisse spends most of the film with a slightly stunned look which is accompanied by Gene Kelly's permanent manic grin. The songs are generally dreadful ( Waiting for my Dearie must rank near the top in toe curling banality). Kelly and Charisse are magnificent when they dance but this is near balletic stuff and is difficult to take more than once since it is so artificial. The highland dancing is fake which is a pity since so much more could have been made of this rich lore of traditional dance. The film lacks the gusto and fun of 'Seven Brides'and is twee and banal and all in all does not travel well through time.

0061092037|1.0|Not recommended.  The story could have been told in far less than 742 pages.  The first part was intriguing, as we were introduced to the two main characters -- two children in different parts of the world with vastly different lifestyles, both clever and entrepreneurial.  Their devious ways were entertaining.  When they became mega-business competitors as adults, it was mildly interesting.  But by the time I was half-way through the book, I realized that I didn't care about either of them.  There was a great lack of character development.  As businessmen, they were ruthless and amoral; as people, they were uncaring and self-centered.  There was nothing likeable about either of them.  The last 300 pages were nothing but repeated plotting and scheming against each other, ad nauseum.  But because I had read other books by this author that were exceptionally good, I plodded on, hoping for an exciting conclusion.  Disappointingly, the ending was extremely ho-hum.  The only bit of satisfaction for me was tossing this book into my trash can.
B00000IQW0|2.0|When I was a kid, I loved this movie and the TV series.  I was a devoted fan, and built model rockets of the Viper fighter, and dreamed of one day being a starfighter pilot.  So you can imagine that I was very excited about getting this DVD.  Unfortunately, now that I am an adult it simply isn't possible to enjoy it any more.  The storyline is full of holes and every cliche you can think of.  The special effects are cheap.  It's just no fun anymore.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|I have never in my life seen a worse interpretation of a Jane Austen novel.  It was as if they had taken the novel and splashed black paint all over it!  I have just finished watchng it and that ghastly music is still ringing in my ears.  You could not possibly like this movie if you have read the book. The acting is fake. None of the characters in this movie have any charm.  How it's possible to make the most beautiful characters such as Henry Tilney and Catherine Morland so ugly is beyond me.  But it's done here.  I won't even mention characters such as the Marchioness, the general, and the Thorpes.  This is very, very sad...
B0007PALZ2|1.0|If you are the type that likes happy endings, avoid this movie!  Bruce Willis dies and he doesn't save the world, and the journey to this depressing conclusion is no fun at all.  It reminded me of Arlington Road, where the terrorist uses the good guy to blow up the building at the end of the movie.  Also, in this movie, the repetitive flashbacks to Bruce's airport dream were overdone.  By the 3rd time, I was saying \\"I got it already\\", and by the 5th or 6th flashback I was ready to throw something at the screen.  In the featurette, Terry Gilliam said that he thought he had managed to snooker the major studios into producing a \\"European art movie\\".  He did, and I hate European art movies.  On the other hand, if you like such things, you'll probably like the film.  It was well acted.
0618680004|2.0|Ultimately, the reviews of this book will nearly always fall at either 5 stars, or a single star - accorded to unbelievers and believers in that order, with a person's belief and their recommendations having an inverse relationship.  Someone says the writer uses Biblical scripture inaccurately, gives it one star, and has some miniscule amount of support (something like 3 out of 60 people). <br /> <br />If you're looking for a wholly accurate review of the book, you'll find it in the one Amazon.com provides through, I believe, Publisher's Weekly.   <br /> <br />But I suppose a bit of background is required, after all.  I've drifted through being raised Christian like everyone else (even went to a Christian college) to, recently agnosticism and Unitarian Universalism, going back and forth between the latter two.  Not sure where I'll ultimately end up in all the mix, but there you go.  I'm not banging any bibles here... but I'm not burning them, either. <br /> <br />As the main review says, the book works the best when he Dawkins attempts to actually debate it soberly.  The problem therein is that there isn't really anything new in his debates.  The book seems more aimed to add \\"fuel to the fire\\" of this anti-religion clique making the rounds these days through the libraries of hipper-than-thou hipsters.  Another prong to stick up their noses at the rest of the world a bit higher. <br /> <br />The worst comes in the rest of the book, which traps Dawkins in the \\"angry athiest\\" stigma quite easily.  Quite frankly, his arguement that his humanism is what drives this hate isn't all that convincing.  Granted, I'm not saying he had some bad experience or what-not as many Christians would expect...I'm just not altogether convinced it's that simple. <br /> <br />And, yes, he does misunderstand Scripture.  The part of my brain that remembers the Christian theology I was raised into couldn't help but argue with him throughout much of it.  If you're sincerely looking for a book of this anti-religion ilk for information rather than for validation, you'll find a better writer in Sam Harris. <br /> <br />But I have no aspirations of being a \\"Top 500 Reviewer\\" - so do with this review as you will.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Amy Lee's vocals are the stuff of soaring emotion. Sad, overpowering and soaring into ecstasy . . . almost operatic. \\"Good Enough\\" can bring you to tears. This is a wondrous album. Every song is excellent. Highly recommended. I loved \\"Fallen\\", but this album is so much more special.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I have the movie on VHS and now I found the DVD version.  I have never seen the 1939 version with Merle Oberon, but I read and re-read the novel several times and this is defintley not a star-crossed love story like Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />Cathy and Heathcliffe are not pleasant people, their love for each other turns to spite and inconsideration for everyone else in their world.<br /><br />The novel is VERY dark but graphically real in the sense that Bronte captured the nuance of human emotions...emotions are suprising things, and each charater plays out their good and bad sides.<br /><br />After viewing this movie, I was very pleased that finally someone did capture the spirit of the novel, it shows how Healthcliffe grows from being someone you sympathise with to a total complete tyrant...rather than forgiving, he holds on to the grudge of his past to torment the children of his beloved cathy and her brother Hindley.
B000002L9W|5.0|Just in case you don't know, this CD has some of the best work all around by everyone involved; But obviously it's Vai and Seehan that steal the show with some of the most amazing riffing ever heard, even today. As good, if not better, than any Van Halen album; Nice variety of song styles, great drums, and lots of insane stringed madness. A true classic...
B000957O82|4.0|why this is a great film. For starters Will Smith and Kevin James III have a great rapport, and their scenes sizzle. I can imagine that they improvised a lot of their scenes. Will Smith and Eva Mendes look like they are in love, and both produce great performances. Anytime I feel low I put this on, and it always produces a smile, and a lot of laughs. Great Film.
B000301YY8|3.0|You know the ones...\\"High\\", \\"You're Beautiful\\", \\"Wisemen\\", and \\"Tears and Rain\\". I appreciate the lyrics on some of the others, but just a little too much whining for me. But those 4 songs are great; I bought the CD for 1 song really, so I came out ahead. His next album will be better, no doubt about that. Def. someone to watch...
B0000259IH|5.0|This 1979 release, IMO is his best solo release, and sounds timeless. Forget the hype surrounding the man; this is Michael at his best. Subsequent releases (particularly Thriller) would go on to cement his name in musical history (and IMO cause him to try and chase the record sales on future releases) I wish Mike would go back to this winning formula. Take one excellent producer (Quincy Jones) a backing group of top rate musicians (Paulino Da Costa, for example on Percussion) and live instruments, with great songs (by Michael himself, Stevie Wonder, Rod Templeton) This is one CD that you  can let play without skipping tracks. From the great 'don't Stop (`til you get enough) listen to the great percussion that under pines this track, to rock with you, Working day and Night, and the title track, just flow. One of the essential albums of the 70's, 80's.
B000002IGP|5.0|The songs, the guitarwork, the hooks, the vocals...This is one of those albums that ages well; Every song a classic, still sounds great loud. Can't go wrong here...Some of my favorite leads ever are here, by the way...By far the best Ratt album.
1565117786|5.0|This is a book written from the heart; filled with deep soul searching and honesty. I'm familiar with alcohol and drug addiction. I'm familiar with treatment centers. For those of you who know this road - this book touches home. For those of you who don't - don't be the first to throw that proverbial 'stone'. I've heard the reports of the 'untruths' regarding this publication. I read it anyway. Pain is an immense ocean. The depth of that ocean is different for each of us. This 'message' could be a gift for many; a starting point, a different way of looking at life and it's unkind lessons. This book offers an open hand to start you on a journey towards reality; toward clarity. For those of you who belittled this book - be it truth or sensationalism - be cautious! You never know what life holds for you or yours around the next bend. The information offered here, the idea of taking that 'first step towards recovery', the process of becoming HONEST with yourself and others, could well be the salvation for someone you love. Yep, it's got some rough language. Did you really expect anything else from a drug addict? Common! Gimme' a break! Get real with yourself! Keep an open mind and dig into this book! It's a good read! <br />You might just learn something you didn't know in the process. <br />
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Yep, it pushes the envelope. But Roth knows what's he's doing, and has created a truly horrific situation with even more horrific consequences. The underlying backstory to why this is happening is evil in itself; Hard to watch and even harder to listen to at times, 'Hostel' demands your attention. It's smart and has something to offer for what it is. And without saying too much, this movie contains payback. Everybody somehow gets a little kharma coming back to them...The acting is pretty good considering the amount of screaming and pleading they have to do, and alot of the violence is more suggested. Could have done without the eye scene, though...
B000002LIR|4.0|Box sets always bring up arguments as to what's missing but there is very little missing from this set. Having every one of Rod''s CDs, the only three missing tracks that I would have put on here are \\"I Feel The Whole World Go Round\\" from the 60s band Shotgun Express,  \\"Farewell\\" from Smiler and \\"The Wild Horse\\" from Out of Order. (OK and maybe two or three others!) but overall, the selection was excellent. It puts Rod Stewar in context, and much of the 80s stuff holds up every well to the sacred early 70s stuff. (Rod was always a great singles artist, though some of his albums are really terrible.)      The box set was thrown together very quickly though, and the packaging is weak. The book is thin and flimsy and features just one essay by writer Robert Palmer, who does a good job of praising without going overboard. But Warners always treated Rod Stewart like [...] and this box set deserved a better package.
B000HIVQD0|5.0|First off, I need to say something about the impact that this album has had on the course of popular rock music, both at the time, and still today. From the moment the PRETENDERS first album came out, it was hailed by critics and fans as an immediate rock and roll classic. Perhaps because of the various styles each song explored, while still having a unique sound as a band, you could tell right off, that this was not going to be a gimic band that would come out with a couple of albums and disappear. With talented musicians, the intellegent lyrics tinged with eastern spirituality, and the post punk energy matched up with cutting edge new wave sound production, this band had it all. One song is reggae (PRIVATE LIFE DRUMMER), one song has jazzy, avant guarde time changes thruout the song (TATTOOED LOVE BOYS), you have beautiful ballads (LOVERS OF TODAY) next to high energy punk (PRECIOUS), top fourty BRASS IN POCKET pop perfection, and just a general sense of COOLNESS that vibrates all thru this record. One can tell a good album, because it transcends its time, and whatever the current sound might be, to reach back in music history, and grab parts of all that came before, while still breaking enough new ground, to point towards future possiblities. PRETENDERS did that. So, the real question is, you have the CD already, maybe the LP as well, so do you fork over up to 25$ for a new copy?<br /><br />Hey, are you a die hard fan or not? I saw this band live in THE TOWER THEATER down in Philly, during the early part of 1981, and that band blew me away. IT was all there, sound, hip image, great song writing, everything. I had been listening to PRETENDERS for about two years by that time. I had the first album, and EXTENDED PLAY, a USA only EP released right before the second album. The EP had a couple of my all time favorite songs by the band, PORCELEAN, and CUBAN SLIDE, (only released on that EP) as well as MESSAGE OF LOVE, and TALK OF THE TOWN from the upcoming album. The EP closed with a killer live version of PRECIOUS from Central Park in the summer of 1980. I was always disappointed that this EP was forgotten. However, with these extended versions of the first two PRETENDERS albums, it's now possible to listen to those songs again. (Actually, I found the first two songs on the bonus CD a long time ago, on a German import BEST OF, but besides that, i dont think they were ever issued on CD domestically, until the Box Set.) One thing that the BONUS CD allows you, is an overhead view on how the first album was created. Much the way the VU and DOORS box sets, showed how THE DOORS 1st LP and VELVET UNDERGROUND's first albums arrived with such an advanced level of direction and sound, so does this Bonus CD show the early history of the band. Each part of the bonus CD fascinates. From the earliest demos (THE PHONE CALL from 1977), until the live songs from early 1980, and the EXTENDED PLAY tracks, the first three years are musically represented. Most songs are as good as anything that rests on the first album. Some songs are instrumentals, which were the B-sides from the Singles that PRETENDERS released. SWINGING LONDON is just that, a 60s-retro instrumental, and NERVOUS BUT SHY an instrumental too. (tho that song might be the weakest on the album.) It's with these B-sides, that IN THE STICKS should be found. It was B-side to LOUIE LOUIE from the second album, but the bonus CD for PRETENDERS II was pretty full, so why not throw it on the bonus CD for the first album? It too is an instrumental, written by Martin Chambers. It's not an especially great song, no different that NERVOUS BUT SHY, but it would have made the output of the early band all in print on CD, in one place. (Isnt this the point of these reissues anyway?) Maybe because of Chrissie's problems with Martin over the years, and the fact that he was the only writer of the song, explains it's absense. Oh well, whatever. The unreleased songs far outweigh that deleted song however.TEQUILA, written by Chrissie, experiments with the band's COUNTRY MUSIC chops. YUP, parder, yer herd it here first. Jimmy Scott plays beautiful slide guitar, while the band holds together a good imitation of punkabily until the end, when they start to rock out a bit. I NEED SOMEONE, is Chrissie using her pipes for one of those spell binding covers of old R&B she does so well. (It's the initial indication of how she would perfect her ability to sing heartringing rhythym and blues covers like THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE, and MAY THIS BE LOVE, among many.) On the live CD on PRETENDERS II, Chrissie belts out HIGHER AND HIGHER, with a horn section no less. Many of the demos, and live songs differ vastly from the studio versions. KID, for instance, is much faster, while BRASS IN POCKET clocks in at a much slower tempo. As for that live SABRE DANCE number, all i can say is that Jimmy Scott liked to show off his guitar prowness from time to time. That song shows what PUNK ART ROCK would have sounded like, had it existed at the time. (I was reminded the way ELP would copy the classics. Between the country song and this, i found that the band was even more versatile than i had imagined.) In any case, if you are in for an alternate version of one of the true classics of rock, I think that with the demos, BBC radio shows, LIVE versions, and B-sides, you can program an alternate version of the first album. It's a perfect oppotunity to learn how this ATHENA of an album jumped out of the head of ZEUS fully formed.<br /><br />One last remark, that may be of interest to potential buyers. The design of these reissues dumps the JEWEL CASE format, and exchanges it for those mini-album designs. The Mini-LP cover opens up like a Triplych, with the inside central panel showing the album sleeve artwork (remember the boy with the toy robot?), along with photos of each band member, two on this first CD, and the other two on the insides of Pretenders II. So, consider buying both of these together. They make an art statement together.  However, that might be a lot of money to lay out unless you are a huge fan, or just happen to keep company with hundreds of GRANTS and JOHNSONS at a time. In any event, I didnt feel too aggrivated being forced to buy the first two albums a second time on CD to get the bonus discs. This improved mini-LP artwork, along with the revealing essays, fully printed LYRICS, and well annotated recording information, is worth it. Personally, major fans at the VERY LEAST ought to have been drooling the moment they heard this was released, and will buy it no matter what i write.. TEQUILA, written by Chrissie, experiments with the band's COUNTRY MUSIC chops. YUP, parder, yer herd it here first. Jimmy Scott plays beautiful slide guitar, while the band holds together a good imitation of punkabily until the end, when they start to rock out a bit. I NEED SOMEONE, is Chrissie using her pipes for one of those spell binding covers of old R&B she does so well. (It's the initial indication of how she would perfect her ability to sing heartringing rhythym and blues covers like THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE, and MAY THIS BE LOVE, among many.) On the live CD on PRETENDERS II, Chrissie belts out HIGHER AND HIGHER, with a horn section no less. Many of the demos, and live songs differ vastly from the studio versions. KID, for instance, is much faster, while BRASS IN POCKET clocks in at a much slower tempo. As for that live SABRE DANCE number, all i can say is that Jimmy Scott liked to show off his guitar prowness from time to time. That song shows what PUNK ART ROCK would have sounded like, had it existed at the time. (I was reminded the way ELP would copy the classics. Between the country song and this, i found that the band was even more versatile than i had imagined.) In any case, if you are in for an alternate version of one of the true classics of rock, I think that with the demos, BBC radio shows, LIVE versions, and B-sides, you can program an alternate version of the first album. It's a perfect oppotunity to learn how this ATHENA of an album jumped out of the head of ZEUS fully formed. <br /> <br />One last remark, that may be of interest to potential buyers. The design of these reissues dumps the JEWEL CASE format, and exchanges it for those mini-album designs. The Mini-LP cover opens up like a Triplych, with the inside central panel showing the album sleeve artwork (remember the boy with the toy robot?), along with photos of each band member, two on this first CD, and the other two on the insides of Pretenders II. So, consider buying both of these together. They make an art statement together.  However, that might be a lot of money to lay out unless you are a huge fan, or just happen to keep company with hundreds of GRANTS and JOHNSONS at a time. In any event, I didnt feel too aggrivated being forced to buy the first two albums a second time on CD to get the bonus discs. This improved mini-LP artwork, along with the revealing essays, fully printed LYRICS, and well annotated recording information, is worth it. Personally, major fans at the VERY LEAST ought to have been drooling the moment they heard this was released, and will buy it no matter what i write.
B000HCO840|1.0|Rather than review the movie, which I like quite a bit, I'm reviewing the Collector's Edition package. All the CE includes is a slip box case and a mini-comic book compilation.  In the compilation, only one is new, the remainder being old stories.  The CE package also includes the standard widescreen package, clamshell case and all.  It is EXACTLY the same.   <br /> <br />Why exactly does one pay for the extra junk?  I did because I didn't read the description carefully enough.  You shouldn't.  Get the standard WS version and save $10.  The movie is the same and so is the transfer.  Great movie by the way.
B000I2IT44|5.0|Porcupine Tree has to be one of the best bands of the past decade.  I just recently bought a cd of there's a year ago and have since been blown away by there talent.  This dvd is something that critical fans of quality music will enjoy.  I am fortunate to own some excellent equipment and the audio quality is top notch. The instruments are very clear and distinguishable.  The video quality is not as perfect as you would hope but too me it is acceptable.  I am sure they didn't have an unlimited budget and had to spend less somewhere.  The video editing is perfect for me.  I actually enjoy watching them play.  I am not a fan of the Iron Maiden approach of changing screen shots every 2-4 seconds. This is a must buy if you are PT fan. If you never heard of them and are interested in quality progressive rock - this is something that you might want to experiment. I hope this review shed some light and wasn't one of this - \\"this rocks\\" - useless reviews.
076790382X|2.0|This collection of short essays he published in an English paper (and meant for an English audience) seem to miss the mark for American readers.  It's as if he published this because he needed money.  There was nothing original in this book, nothing really funny and what few authentically funny parts there were seemd trite and at times exaggerated.<br /><br />I got tired of this book half-way through and gave up.
B000GY729M|5.0|April 2005 was when I first read in that month's issue of Rolling Stone that The Killers were going into the studio to write a new batch of songs to throw on an amazing CD.  As I read the article the was a comment by Brandon about how it was going to sound different from Hot Fuss focusing the sounds American influences.  At first my heart kinda sunk but, then I thought about it and knew that it would be the same Killers. Fastforward to present-day I have had Sam's Town since 11:10 am on the 3rd of October.  I put the CD in my CD player pulling out of the CD store parking lot and it hit me.  This CD is amazing it's everything I thought it would be.  Listening to a lot of 80's bands with heavy synth like Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, Berlin, New Order, and The Cure I was absolutely mesmerized.  The synth parts to the songs are absolutely astounding!!!! Sure Sam's Town isn't a repackaging of Hot Fuss but think about it, would you really want to hear a CD with every song that sounded almost exactly like Mr. Brightside or Jenny was a Friend of Mine over and over agian? NO!!! Want to know why?  Because those songs are unique.  There's only one of each of those songs.  What I think is important is that it reminds us who lived through the 80's as kids (by kids i mean if you turned at least 5 yrs old during the span of the decade) or young adults of the music that was the best music ever created in that decade New Wave!!!  If you were disappointed with your first to tenth listen to Sam's Town I would suggest listening to it again.  Listen to the SYNTH this time all the way through and I promise you will not be disappointed agian with this CD.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|I've only heard the first single, but that is all I have to hear to no this album is going to suck. I heard the first album and I noticed something, every song sounds the exact same boring and whiny.The new song sounds pretty much like every song off their first album. This band is just a boring and generic rock band with a great singer. <br /> <br />IF you want to here some real rock and roll, relive the glory days, then check out some of these bands: Rose Hill Drive, Silvertide, The White Stripes, The Black Keys,The Mars Volta, Wolfmother , those are real rock and roll bands.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Jim Henson is more genius than we know.  Beyond Labyrinth, Big Bird and Miss Piggy comes a story far different and far more fantastical than anything ever exhibited on screen to date.  It was a movie created many, many years before its time that explored aspects and concepts that exist in the philosophies of some of our oldest religions today...along with a great adventure story.    <br /> <br />While exhibited in the guise of a children's fantasy film, if you dig deeper in the symbology and metaphors of the film there are great truths that exist.  The oneness of life, humanity and spirit.  The duality of good and evil.  Mortality and immortality.  Images of light and darkness.  What a genious manner in which it was filmed, scored and portrayed.  This is indeed Jim henson's finest cinematic work.   <br /> <br />Some beliefs do acknowledge that in ancient of ancient times there was life in all things:  rocks, plants, trees could talk and move, there existed a highly sophisticated and superior race of beings that suddenly vanished or became obliterated.   <br /> <br />It is understandable that \\"The Dark Crystal\\" had failed at the box office when it first came out.  Such a small scale epic could not compete in the shadow of the success of the original Star Wars.  But this quieter film is still a spectacle of its own and, much like its Star Wars counterpart, has become a unique classic of richness and depth...one that can never be repeated again. I've enjoyed this movie since I was a kid, and it's never lost its appeal after 24 years. This is well worth the money spent to keep in your DVD library   <br /> <br />
B000GY729M|5.0|This is progressive rock... not pop. People always expect more of the same sound whenever new material comes out, and they tend to be disappointed. That is the tell tale sign that screams progressive. Thus a band cannot be progressive if they don't progress. In my humble opinion this album is full of life, and all around better than \\"Hot Fuss\\". The songs are catchy, meaningful and musically stunning. Don't let distorted initial opinions from stagnent followers discourage you from buying this record. 5 stars.
B000002U8G|2.0|It had been years since I'd heard this and thought I would add it to my collection, now I know why it has been years since I listened to it, I'll continue with my CCW, Bob Seger, Fleetwood Mac...
078681859X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, and the following books in the series. Very original, I especially enjoyed the continuous shifting point of view between Bartimaeus (Jini) and Nathaniel (magician in training). The book is fast paced with plenty of action and sly humor. ... Good read.  <br /> <br />D. M. Paul: author of One Wizard Place. <br />
B000HIVOI2|5.0|If there's any question what the technology CAN do, buy this Blu-ray disc.  So clear it is almost three dimensional.  Unlike most of the Warner Brothers Blu-ray releases, Lions Gate has taken great care to give you a return on your investment.  Would have been nice to have added some special features.  But this will be one the folks selling the players are using as a demo in the stores.<br /><br />The movie is your standard science fiction B-movie story with the A+ cinematography.  The only frustrating thing is that for a great deal of the dialogue you are listening to an alien variation on Ancient Egyptian with no subtitles.  And you never completely understand why the bad guys are so upset.  But if you like science fiction, you should spring for the twenty bucks and add the to your Blu-ray collection.
0375505091|5.0|Annie Liebovitz, one of the world's most talented photographers, has released a book that is not as much an exhibit of her world-renowned photography as it is an open expression of her love for family and close friends.  The famous people that we've come to expect from a Liebovitz release are still there, although extremely limited.  This is more a baring of Annie's soul and personal feelings that one has rarely had the opportunity to see and feel.  If you're buying this book for the usual Annie Liebovitz material, you would do best to ignore this release.  If you're wanting to see a side of this photographer that the world has rarely seen, please don't hesitate to make the purchase.
B000HCO840|2.0|I loved the first two films, but they blew it big time with this bomb. From cliche lines like \\"What the...?\\" to Halle Berry's consistently wooden performance (the woman might be pretty but she couldn't act her way out of a speeding ticket) this movie might be worth renting, but you probably would never want to see it twice. Worse than bad, it's just strangely boring. Major characters are killed and we just don't care. Blame the director and Hollywood's catering to talentless Halle. I'm hawking my DVD to the second-hand bin first chance I get.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Oh man. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw this in the theaters and felt like giving it a standing ovation afterwards. I bought this movie the day it came out on DVD and have watched it 5 times since then. This movie has superb acting, great action sequences, and an ending that will blow you away. Everyone I know who I've reccomended this movie to has loved it. Most people who didn't like it probobly couldn't understand it. I don't get why Republican people hate this movie so much. They only mention America like once in this movie, and I don't think it's just leftist propaganda, I think it's a wonderful film that makes you think. Great performance by Hugo Weaving and Nataile Portman. Two thumbs way up!
B000002MM8|4.0|The work of Dead Can Dance, Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard, might be best described as cross-cultural. Some songs sound like Celtic songs from the middle ages while others sound like Islamic chants from the desert countries. On \\"Into the Labyrinth\\", I found that The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove; The Wind That Shakes the Barley; The Carnival is Over; Tell Me about the Forest; Ariadne; and HOw Fortunate the Man with None were my favorite 6 selections. Perry's voice has a dreamy quality that is hard to describe, kind of like Dean Martin does Lebanon. I certainly like the multicultural blending of musical traditions that Dead Can Dance offers.
B000GFRDN6|5.0|Like many other people my age, I have slowly and steadily been replacing my old cd's, that were originally issued back in the late 80's and early 90's, with newly \\"remastered\\" versions.  I am an audiophile, so good sound is very important.  Most remasters are a bargain!  You get updated sound, new liner notes, unreleased photos, bonus tracks, etc.<br /><br />This 30th Anniversary edition of Steve Miller's Fly Like an Eagle is one of the best! You get exactly what anyone would expect from a \\"Special Editon\\" remaster.  Updated sound quality, bonus tracks (3), a bonus DVD with a nice interview of Steve Miller on the making of/recording of Fly Like an Eagle (30 minutes) and a modern performance of Steve and his current bandmates recorded last year (2005) that's over 2 hours long!<br /><br />Don't let the other very picky reviewer's sway you about the so called \\"poor quality\\" dvd.  It is NOT Horrible!  What these people failed to realize is the dvd was not planned, it just happened, and when Steve Miller himself saw it, he thought it captured the \\"magic\\" of one of their better shows.  So it was decided it would be released.  The dvd is simply a recording of the projection screen images used during their concert.<br /><br />I was very happy to see that this classic album was finally given the updated, newly remastered treatment.  It is one of the best special edition packages I have bought.<br /><br />Let's just hope Book of Dreams gets the same level of attention for their next release.  That would be great.
B000F39M9W|4.0|A few thoughts, Disney Concert Hall produces bass powerfully. Ok. It's huge. Not boomy. The sound engineers are top. It's very balanced. It's smooth, deep, and rich. This SACD is a sonic show piece for bass. The only place were it may have been over the top is in the opening of The Miraculous Mandarin, the organ enters as if it's a monster. (If that's the point, they've succeeded.) Though, only the suite, this version of the Mandarin is one of Bartók's versions which is \\"essentially the first two thirds\\" of the longer score--it is all of the best parts. The disc as a whole is fun, shimmery (rather than icy), colorful, and liquid. The bass seems to stand out, but I'm not used to powerful bass. All the instruments (strings, horns, percussion) are well voiced throughout. I'm happy with this premiere recording. <br />
B000GCFO0I|5.0|When Silent Hill was out, I was thinking that this was another one of those cheezy movie made from a cheezy video game.  None of those video game movies were any good. I did not even bother to go see this movie. I was so wrong!!! <br /> <br />I have never played the game but this movie is actually very good. The mood is right on and the visual is awesome.  The story is smooth and to the point.  I am not lost at all.  I especially love the end credit sequence. <br /> <br />Your daughter is gone and you need to look for her. So you go from point A to point B to point C. There are monsters in between. The story seems very simple on the surface. However, the story is really deep. <br /> <br />This is a must see movie.
0143036238|5.0|Perhaps the mother of all romances, this classic cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me Jane Austen story stands as a model that many modern romances seem formulated upon. Not a pure romance however, Austen offers so much more to her readers in P&P: realistic relationships, interesting characters, comical situations and compelling subplots force readers to think in many directions and entertain far and beyond boy loves girl. This particular copy of P&P would make a perfect little gift for anyone just introduced to the story or Austen through this latest movie version (or as a companion to the movie) and is a wonderful beginning to immersing oneself in the English language of 200 years ago. To be certain, this sort of old classic literature may be a challenge to peruse at first, but rest assured that it becomes easier to assimilate the more you read it.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Tool are, of course, one of the greatest bands on the planet, and are therefore held to a higher standard than other ordinary 'rock groups'. I think its safe to say they've achieved cult status in the course of their career, and each new release is examined by the legions of Tool freaks like some mysterious artefact discovered on a distant planet. 10,000 days was highly anticipated (to put it mildly), and took its own sweet time getting here. Like many other Tool fans, I bought it immediately upon its release, and... was not disppointed. It doesn't cut as mercilessly as Lateralus, but after repeated listenings, I feel I am only beginning to penetrate its mysteries. A measure of its brilliance when most rock albums these days grow tired within a week or two. The band are incredible on this thing, particularly the guitarist, Adam Jones, who we can now consider as the leading master of the instrument. Maynard is Maynard, and does his thing like only he can. The songs are long, yes, but so what? A band this great needs room to explore and that's exactly what they do, taking us along for a wild ride in the process. Although it doesn't quite reach the heights of Lateralus (what does?) 10,000 Days is a fantastic album (in a really cool package) and no Tool fan will be disappointed. The only niggle I have is that there is a bit of filler on the album which shouldn't be there. Not after five years of navel-gazing and rumination (or were they actually working on their tans on the beaches of Majorca?). If there were two more great songs here instead of the noodling bits, this album would get 5 stars, no problemo. Let's just pray the next one comes a bit quicker...
B000FIMG68|4.0|OK. I do not love Lost but in some ways season two was slightly stronger than season one. IN season one you had a fantastic pilot and then almost no real storyline. This may also be slightly the case in season 2 at times but at least the quality of the dialogies and acting makes the interaction between the characters credible (or more credible at least). While some of the mroe intriguing things in Season 1 are not exploited at all (the monsters) there is much more emphasis on the presence of the Others, even if still very little is being explained. One thing that is somewhat tiring is that whenever one point has been clarified, there comes the next unexpected cliffhanger situation which is not allways necessary. In some ways you need to watch the whole thing in one go in order to make it satisfying since the single episodes themselves do not allways make for coherent viewing.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Until recently, I hadn't seen The Little Mermaid. My family and I went to Disneyworld for the first time in August 2006, and seeing the live Little Mermaid show--as well as the preliminary sketches for Ursula at the Disney Animation Studio--piqued our interest in this classic Disney tale.<br /><br />My son became smitten with Ariel and as soon as the Platinum edition came out, we bought it!<br /><br />The re-colored version is FANTASTIC: they show the before and after pictures and the difference is amazing. Instead of a washed out pumpkin color, Sebastian is now a vibrant red/orange crustacean!<br /><br />The Backstage Disney disc is especially fascinating. The writers, directors, animators, and voice actors were intereviewed for this Plantinum disc, providing some fascinating insights into what went into making The Little Mermaid.<br /><br />For example, I was surprised to find that Jeffrey Katzenberg was pushing for Part of Your World to be eliminated from the movie. (Honestly, can you IMAGINE this movie without that signature song?!) Apparently, the movie was screened before some youngsters and an anal little girl dropped her popcorn in the front row. She bustled around--ignoring the film--so she could pick up the popcorn.<br /><br />An equally anal Katzenberg took that as a sign that the song was boring and should be removed from the movie--even after the animators and others BEGGED him to keep it in. The man who did the animation for that incredible scene begged Katzenberg, too, and earned it a stay of execution. And it's a darn good thing, too!<br /><br />There are additional fascinating bits of information in the Backstage disc, including:<br /><br />*How many expected Ariel to be blonde, but because Splash with Darryl Hannah was just released they wanted to do something different. Apparently, there was quite a fight between blonde and red--but red (thankfully!) won out!<br /><br />*There was another full-length song written before Poor Unfortunate Soul called \\"Silence is Golden\\". We get to hear how the song sounds--sung by, if I'm not mistaken, composer Alan Menken!<br /><br />*A brand new shade of green was invented just for Ariel--called, appropriately, \\"Ariel Green\\".<br /><br />*How Jodi Benson's daughters ask her to sing Part of Your World--every other night before bedtime!<br /><br />I also enjoyed hearing about Hans Christian Anderson (although his bio is a sad one), from those involved with the Disney movie as well as the curator of the Anderson Museum in Odense, Denmark.<br /><br />There are other great extras on these 2 discs, including a video of Ashely Tisdale (High School Musical; Suite Life of Zach and Cody) singing \\"Kiss the Girl\\", the animated short \\"The Little Match Girl\\" (what a tear jerker!), a virtual adventure on a theme park ride (that was, sadly, never built) created by Disney Imagineers and much more.<br /><br />We have both the Plantinum version of the Little Mermaid, as well as the soundtrack, and we LOVE IT. I highly recommended this movie for both kids and adults; the colors are eye-popping, the story compelling (and much gentler than the Anderson version), and the songs SPECTACULAR.

B000GUK630|5.0|This has to be Bob Marley's best studio album ever; the tracks are all great and indeed every one of them would not sound out of place on a greatest hits compilation.  In addition to the brilliant title track, we get \\"Three Little Birds\\", \\"Waiting in Vain\\", \\"Jammin\\", \\"One Love\\" and \\"Turn Your Lights Down Low.\\" That's 60% of the original album track listing already and yet here we also get 2 bonus tracks as well.<br /><br />The mini-lp sleeve design is a work of art and comes with a sheet with all the English and Japanese lyrics to each song included.  Although, this disc has not been remastered, the sound quality is very, very good and even beats that of some other albums I have that claim to have been accorded the remastered treatment.<br /><br />Great tracks, great packaging and great sound quality make this an excellent value for money.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
B000002LSV|3.0|One look at the tracks...  naw.  Just buy the first album,  maybe the 2nd, DeGuello...  the rest of the 80's stuff was saturated junk (IMHO).<br /><br />But hey...  it's just my personal opinion.  There's ALOT of really good lead action missing here.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|Being an avid fan of this Jane Austen classic, I must say that this version is just lovely!  I have read the book, seen both the black & white version with Laurence Olivier and watched the BBC version with Colin Firth several times. Now after watching this newest version for about the 12th time I think it is by far the best adaptation!  Though it doesn't cover all the intricate details of the story and the characters the way the BBC version does, this new version offers so much more in the way of such spectacular scenery and breathtaking scenes of vivid emotion between Elizabeth and Darcy. With this version you really feel as though you were there witnessing how the Bennets really lived in a way that's easier to visualize and relate to.  Further more, it was quite refreshing to see Keira put so much feeling and personality into her role like I have never seen \\"Elizabeth\\" portrayed before. No matter how many times I see this splendid film it never ceases to make my heart skip a beat!  To anyone that's read the book or seen the BBC version, I hope you find this version as heartwarming and romantic as I do!
B000HCO8IQ|4.0|NY-based Scissor Sisters stormed onto the music scene 2 years ago with their self-titled debut album, which made them superstars in... the UK (and subsequently the rest of Europe). Eventually, the US started noticing a bit as well, and Scissor Sisters became a big name onto the \\"alternative\\" music scene, but that did not yet cross over into mainstream success.<br /><br />\\"Ta-Dah) (12 tracks, 47 min.) starts off with the ironicly titled (and first single) \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\" (co-written with Elton John, who also plays the piano), which is an irresitable singalong (and makes even a wallflower want to dance). The opening bars of \\"She's My Man\\" feels like you are listening to Elton John's \\"All the Girls Love Alice\\". The great tracks keeps coming: \\"I Can't Decide\\" and then \\"Lights\\", which transports you back to the Bee Gees-era \\"Saturday Night Fever\\". After a couple of slower tracks, the process starts back up again on the second half of the album. \\"Ooh\\" is reminiscent of their \\"Comfortably Numb\\" Pink Floyd cover on the debut album. \\"Paul McCartney\\" (yes, THAT Paul McCartney) is another disco-stomper.<br /><br />Whether this album will lead to Scissor Sisters' commercial breakthrough in the US remains to be seen. The band gets virtually no airplay on mainstream radio, despite the obvious appeal of the lead-off single \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\". No matter. This is fun music, from start to finish, meant to be enjoyed for what it is, no less, no more.
0805076476|5.0|This book stutters awkwardly through a strange, nails-to-chalkboard, rambling story.  The characters are jaded, disgusting and destructive.  The language is coarse and simple. <br /> <br />It is simply one of the most brilliant pieces of writing this generation has seen.  Chuck shoves his finger up grammar's *** with no apology. <br /> <br />Beautiful.  Original.  Viscerally satisfying. <br /> <br />Read it for the carnal thrill.  Or the literary genius.  Or the clever social commentary.  Or better yet, all three. <br /> <br />Think Picasso.  It's that good.
B00000DCH9|5.0|In 1971, Billy Joel released his debut album entitled \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\".   The album wouldn't attract much fanfare.  However if one heard that debut album, it was more of a \\"subdued\\" effort when comparing it against his later works.   At the same time, the songs were reflective of Billy's personality and he was on a quest for inspiration. One thing was very clear from that debut album - Billy Joel was one talented musician.    Legal entanglements with the label that released \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" prompted a change to Columbia Records.   Billy would then release his second album - \\"Piano Man\\".  From the title, this would not only become a signature album for Billy, but also his signature name.  However, while the piano does play a key role on this collection - this collection isn't all about the piano.   We see Billy show early in his career that he is ready to expand his musical horizons. <br />.     <br />I look at Billy Joel's career as having three phases. The first phase is what I call \\"Old Billy Joel\\". This basically includes all of his material from \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" through \\"Turnstiles\\". These are perhaps the strongest days as the piano sound, but they also contain most of Joel's least heard material. The next phase is what I call \\"Middle Billy Joel\\". This was his most successful period and covers from \\"The Stranger\\" to \\"Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume 1 and 2\\". Joel would go through a transition during this phase - expanding his musical horizons and exploring different avenues. The final phase is the \\"Later Billy Joel\\" phase - this covers \\"The Bridge\\" to \\"River of Dreams\\". In this phase, Billy would start to incorporate some of his older styles of music while not abandoning his desire to continue to explore new avenues.  \\"Piano Man\\" falls into the heart of the \\"Old Billy Joel\\".  As mentioned while the piano plays an integral role on this collection, this collection isn't all about the piano.   This collection will even have Billy exploring such avenuessuch as a folk/country influence.   Most of these songs still won't be familiar to the mainstream fan, but by no means are they \\"filler\\" efforts. <br /> <br />Here is a Track by Track breakdown: <br /> <br />\\"Travelin Prayer\\":  I've heard some folks criticize this song, but I couldn't disagree more.    Listen how to the song starts with the bass/piano combo - that sequence is as good as I have ever heard those two instruments play together.  The song then progresses into a country/folk feel.  Joel sings the song at a first pace.  The best part is - he pulls this off flawlessly.  Joel's piano is awesome, but he also integrates a banjo and fiddle into the package (along with the bass).    The lyrics to the song are basically a prayer. This truly is a Billy Joel song that is a \\"hidden gem\\". <br /> <br />\\"Piano Man\\": This is the title track that would eventually become Billy's personal signature.  This track tells the story of Billy's piano lounge playing days.  Throughout his career, this would become a staple of Billy - singing about his personal experiences. <br /> <br />\\"Ain't No Crime\\": This song is going to have a gospel/bluesy feel to it.   While the piano is going fit like a glove on this song, the horns along with the gospel-choir background vocals are going to compliment Billy's work perfectly. <br /> <br />\\"You're My Home\\": This is a softer song and the country feel will come out again.   This is a song that Billy wrote about his wife.  It deals with the fact that even though Billy is on the road, his relationship with his wife provides him with the stability he desires. <br /> <br />\\"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\\": I've heard Billy do this song in concert, but this is one case where I prefer the studio version to the live version.  Billy constructs an \\"Old West\\" sound.   Billy makes terrific use of all of the instruments to give the sound needed for this theme - with the piano front and center (of course).  This song is sung as a narrative, however listen howJoel throws a reference to \\"Oyster Bay\\" (Long Island) - raising the question of Joel and Billy the Kid are one and the same? <br /> <br />\\"Worse Comes to Worse\\": This song is classic Billy Joel through and through.  Billy references his piano lounge days by saying he makes a living \\"out of a piano bar\\".  This is once again a \\"hidden gem\\" song by Billy. <br /> <br />\\"Stop in Nevada\\":  This song is sung as a narrative.  It is the story of a woman who leaves her man to head out to California.   Along the way, she makes a stop in Nevada.   This song reflects Billy's passion to sing about geographic places.   This is another example of Billy utilizing a country influence on this collection. <br /> <br />\\"If I Only Had the Words (To Tell You)\\":  This song starts out as bluesy piano piece.  Once again - it makes for classic Billy Joel.  This song may also reflect Billy's career and relationship as he has trouble expressing his feelings in words - despite the fact he is a songwriter.  While not as prevalent as in other tracks on this collection, there is a slight country edge to it. <br /> <br />\\"Somewhere Along the Line\\":   Once again, I felt this was classic Billy Joel - especially with the piano work.  Here we have Billy singing about Europe, <br /> <br />\\"Captain Jack\\": I look at this song in a the \\"day of the life\\" of a young man - possibly a teenager.   From the musicianship standpoint, the guitar work is really going to shine here.  On the bridge, there is a very small country influence on this. <br /> <br />The remastered collection includes all of the lyrics.  Overall, there is some good stuff that gets forgotten about when looking at Billy Joel's career.  Most importantly, this album is worthy of giving Billy the name - \\"Piano Man\\".   This is highly recommended.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|The movie is visually stunning with some good one-liners. However, there are some real groaners. The movie makes one think about the role of government and the abuse of power. These are good ideas to ponder. The theme of ideas gives to one of the worse groaners. It went something like \\"Behind this mask is an idea and ideas are bulletproof.\\" The other bad line if you stop and think about it is \\"It is the government that should be afraid of the people.\\" What does that really mean? Respect the people, maybe. A government that fears the people gives rise to dictatorships and genocide.    The movie has some intelligence in the dialog and the plot, but it gives not even a hint toward the answers. The philosopy is inane. Chaos for chaos sake seems to be the message. There are some nice plot twists, but one really big one that does not seem plausible at all.     The movie is visually stunning, the mask is really cool. I did watch all of it without falling asleep. so I'm giving 3 stars. I marginally recommending it.
1572814136|5.0|I got the Rider Waite and the Universal version. that was my fav cause it looked better to the eyes. I was not sure if I should buy the Radiant version cause I got 2 RW decks why would i need another?  But I said to myself  I am going to buy it, to see what it looks like, cause I love to see new versions of the RW deck. I must say the Radiant RW is amazing! The colors are bold and clear its refreashing. I am happy I bought it, If you are starting on Tarot Buy The Radiant or Universal versions they are the best.
0618551050|4.0|After years of spirited propaganda by string theorists purporting to have stumbled upon the ultimate theory of nature, we now have a revealing, tell-all tale that throws back the covers on what has turned out to be the most intellectually disengenuous ruse in the history of science - the continual presentation of string theory as the be-all, end-all theory of everything -  despite its utter lack of predictive power, its failure to predict dark energy, its myriad of versions, and its reliance on anthropic reasoning. Smolin, along with Peter Woit (who also dared to go against the 'establishment') should be thanked for bringing this house-of-crashing cards to the public's attention. Despite pitiful and below-the-belt attacks and outright dismissal by members of the 'stringy' establishment, including a scathing and unprovoked attack by a theorist from Harvard who sees a threat in works of this nature, Smolin gives us a thoughful and provoking look at the many failures (and occasional mathematical successes) of the most overhyped theory in the history of science.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|It's true. Although it is very dark, Amy Lee has done a great job. Her voice is perfect for the tracks. The music is a little different without Ben Moody, but still very impressive. I'm really picky when it comes to music and there are few albums that I can say that I like every song. Look forward to the next one. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|One word... Amazing!!!  Well maybe more words... Madonna continues to go beyond what any of us ever expect.  This album is about 5 years in the future if not more. It's hard to believe that someday we'll listen to this CD as something out of date, but now that I've listened to it about 6 times, I already consider her albums, \\"Music\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\" not as cutting edge as they were when they both came out.  This album surpasses them beautifully. As my friend Drew said best, \\"...she knows how to set a trend and set a trend very very well.\\"  Again, AMAZING CD.  Keep it coming, Madonna. (ps. I love the fact that I'm only about one year older than her, which continues to make me feel good---that I ain't old at all.) (Another ps. While the reviewer before my own posted review doesn't like the album, which he/she is entitled to, I must add that this IS a disco album, so what it lacks in lyrics [somewhat weak; you have to listen between the lines], it makes up for in music composition, which is robust, very unique and yes, for the die-hard Madonna fans, very dance-able.)
B000HT386M|2.0|Easy review, the movie was average.  I am a huge Adam Sandler fan, but except for the last five minutes of the movie, he was playing a character that was not likeable.  His performance seemed rushed and the movie just seemed rough around the edges.  Really, the funniest parts of this comedy were in the 60 second trailer for the movie, actually the only funny parts.  If you are expecting a full fledge Sandler comedy, be warned that this movie is more drama than comedy, though it included some cute comebacks by Sandler.  Christopher Walken was good as usual, Kate Beckinsale, though beautiful beyond belief was a wasted talent in this film.  I am not sure why she took this role, my belief is that she wanted to do a comedy after doing so many action type flicks, but she had absolutely no funny parts and contributed to the dramedy that this film actually is.  The trailer made it look like it was a comedy, but this film is more drama than it was comedy.  In all, the film was a disappointment, it was average at best, but hey Adam Sandler can afford to have a flop once in a while (though financially it wasn't, it made big bucks), he is very talented and Happy Madison Productions will put out more quality product than garbage.  Finally, Sandler is good in dramedies (Punch Drunk Love, Spanglish, etc.).  However, this film was sold as a comedy and to be truthful, it was more sad than funny, but it lacked the ability to be emotional.  Message of the movie, we would all like to bypass the trials of life and speed up to the good moments, but in doing so, you may miss what truly is important while enduring those trials as it is the trials and patience that really makes us grow and human.
0440236738|4.0|This review is for the Bantam Dell mass market paperback edition, March 2003, 420 pages.  GONE FOR GOOD, first published in May 2002, was on the USA Today top 150 best seller list for 15 weeks between May 2002 and May 2003, reaching a peak position of twenty-one.  It is the second of five stand alone thrillers written by Mr. Coben, all of which made the USA Today list.<br /><br />GONE FOR GOOD is a fast paced thriller with at least 60 plot twists, turns or startling revelations (I catalogued them.)  Typical of the genre, it is plot rather than character driven.  Even the best characters are a bit shallow, and you will have to accept some improbable ones.  Dialogue is written well.  Otherwise, the writing is simple - if you got through third grade you won't need a dictionary - although after some stretches of short choppy sentences and dangling phrases you might wish for something more mature.  There is unnecessary violence and implausibility both of character and event.  Again, that seems typical of the genre.<br /><br />The story is fast paced not just because the author uses cliff hanging chapter endings and plot twists.  He dribbles out information.  First there is a limousine, then a man in the back seat, then a man sitting next to him, then a driver, then the relationship suggesting they are hoods, and then finally they are.  You have to turn pages to get this.  Another technique is to insert a short chapter of a seemingly unrelated event, an incomplete scene, and leave it to be developed later, maybe much later.  Also, Coben will interleave chapters with two or more related plot elements as he develops the story.<br /><br />This is a four star read in the thriller genre - put \\"thriller genre\\" in bold italics and underline it.  The reviewers who did not like this novel, in general, dislike violent thrillers without well developed characters.  A few who do read thrillers found the plot too much like Coben's first thriller, TELL NO ONE.  I agree with that.<br /><br />TELL NO ONE opened with a juxtaposition of love and tragedy that was well done and grabbed me in the gut, as it did many other reviewers.  As I read GONE FOR GOOD, I wanted to feel the relationship between Will and Sheila, but it wasn't there.  That disappointed.  For me, the ending in TELL NO ONE was, to be diplomatic, moronic.  As I read the startling ending of GONE FOR GOOD, it seemed too far over the top, but when I got to the one page epilogue, my stomach settled and I smiled.<br /> <br />TELL NO ONE opened with a juxtaposition of love and tragedy that was well done and grabbed me in the gut, as it did many other reviewers.

B000FWHVKA|4.0|This one had to grow on me a little... <br /> <br />Musically, it's pretty solid.  Not very revolutionary, but a good \\"icy\\" electro vibe, not dissimilar to the Ellien Allien/Apparat \\"Orchestra of Bubbles\\" album ---though not exactly the same as that one, either.   <br /> <br />Vocally, it is sometimes strained for my tastes.  The vocals are almost universally distorted in a pitch-shifted way.  This took some time for me to get used to.  I eventually realized that this could be very effective, though I have not entirely shed the perception that it sometimes sounds like a bad Asian stereotype (check track 3 for a good example of this).   <br /> <br />Lyrically, english doesn't sound like their first language.  That in itself doesn't bother me too much, but the excellent music leaves me wishing the lyrics were up to the same level of quality; they aren't.  I tend to think that the native tongue would have sounded more effective in places, rather than as trying too hard.  Even so, I liked the lyrics more as time went on.  <br /> <br />Overall, though, the pluses outweigh the faults.  Please don't misunderstand my criticisms, they are small compared to the overall impact of the record.  It's good!
B00004LN16|2.0|I mainly bought this album because I was going to see them on this tour.  In fact the gig I was at was the opening show on the tour.  Again, the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again.  I find most of this album to be very average.  Actually after listening, this album is not very good at all.  The majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics.  There are a couple of catchy tracks most notably \\"Safe In New York City\\" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic.  Probably one of the bands weakest efforts.
B000HT386M|1.0|The setup for the need of a universal remote was absolutely terrible.  They make Adam Sandler's character out to be a bumbling fool who would mistake an RC controller for a TV remote, but then show his first date with his wife and their song is \\"Linger\\" by the Cranberries.  I think someone in their 20's when \\"Linger\\" was TOP 40 material would know the difference between these two remotes.  Besides, remotes don't remember your most common actions and repeat them automatically.  I don't know what kind of electronic device does this, but a remote it is not.  This is a terrible movie that really makes no sense.  And, quite predictable too. The typical Adam Sandler fare was abound in humping dogs, children cussing and the old O'Doyle family.  But, it all seemed so forced.  Also, why is Hollywood always preaching against a man trying hard to provide for his family with ol' wifey at home struggling with the kids.  I think a lot of women have jobs these days.  I guess they were trying to give it a vintage feel to go along with the universal remote concept.  Most Americans have to work on a daily basis to pay their bills.  Common sense.
B00005Y7NK|3.0|For many the only two eras of Black Sabbath that count are the years with either Ozzy or Dio at the helm.  Personally I also liked a lot of the material that was produced with Tony Martin leading the band as well.  \\"Headless Cross\\" was the second album to feature Martin on vocals with the only remaining original member being Tony Iommi.  Drummer extraordinaire Cozy Powell is also along for the ride on this one.  The music on this album is for the most part quite strong, with Martin's Dio like vocals and Iommi's patented guitar technique leading the way.  Powell and bass player Lawrence Cottle emote a dark and foreboding rhythm section, and long time Sabbath keyboard collaborator Geoff Nicholls is up front more than usual on this one  This lyrics get pretty dark here with Lucifer / the Devil / Satan being mentioned in just about every song.  It almost comes across as if they were writing some of this stuff for shock values sake in order to possibly garner some controversy.  Some of these lyrics could be a definite turn off for more religious oriented people.  The title track managed to get some radio / MTV airplay (I remember seeing the video a couple of times on head bangers ball back in the day) and served as a bit of a comeback for the band following the lackluster sales of the previous two albums.  Along with the title track highlights for me include \\"Devil and Daughter\\", \\"Kill In the Spirit World\\" and the album closer \\"Nightwing\\".  I don't think that this is the best Tony Martin era release, but it is a solid album.
B000H305U0|3.0|Yeah they are both white and soul/R&B singers but Robin Thicke has something that Justin will never have in a million years and that is originality in all aspects of his songs. No one creates beats and lyrics for Thicke he does it all himself with callabos. J.T tries so hard but he doesn't come close so he needs to meet up with Thicke and take some serious musical knowledge. Then I will enjoy his music more....maybe. I miss Nsync.
B00002599I|5.0|<br />For me this album is the most underrated in the entire Sabbath catalogue and remains one of my all time favorites from the band.  The lineup is pretty much the same as on Headless Cross with the exception of bassist Neil Murray (Whitesnake, Gary Moore Band, Brian May Band) joining the fold.  \\"Tyr\\" is a concept album revolving around the god \\"Tyr\\" who is the god of war among other things in Norse mythology.  I am a fan of progressive rock and although this album is not a true prog rock piece of work it certainly leans in that direction.  With song titles like \\"Valhalla\\", \\"The Law Maker\\" and \\"Odin's Court\\" you can pretty much guess what the lyrics are like.  Some will find this all a bit over the top and silly, but for me it works.   I love every track on this disc.  The opener \\"Anno Mundi\\" is killer, the middle of the album is highlighted by \\"The Sabbath Stones\\" which ranks right up with my all time favorite Sabbath songs.  Even the ballad \\"Feels Good To Me\\", though not typical Sabbath, is a great song.  The album closes with \\"Heaven In Black\\" another rocker that brings the whole thing to a crunching climax.  \\"Tyr\\" is just an all around killer album, the music is great, the vocals great, and the lyrics are much better than on \\"Headless Cross\\".  This is an odd album for Sabbath and not really at all like anything else they have done, but for me it ranks right up there with \\"Heaven And Hell\\", and \\"Paranoid\\" as one of their best. <br />
0385751060|1.0|After reading a brief synopsis of the book, I was interested enough to purchase it.  The Holocaust from the point of a child would have been a truly good story, but the character of this book is made into a downright idiot.  His father was a Commandant, he was taught to salute Hitler, but somehow his parents never got around to telling him about Hitler, the Jews, the \\"master\\" race???  I asked the six year old across the street and he knew more about the Holocaust than the main character did.  The author is a wonderful storyteller, and that kept me reading to the end.  The ending, however, felt far too contrived.  It's as if by making the story end this way, the author somehow equalizes things out.  I was disappointed that what could have been a truly excellent book was trivialized by the ending.  I have mixed feelings about recommending this book.  Yes, it is a good plot, but executed in such a way that I feel the author almost played it too safe for fear of upsetting anyone, and in the process, educating no one.  For children today so removed from this part of history, the author could have done so much more to make them understand.  If you are looking for a book for you or your child, this makes for a quick read, but not a thought-provoking one.
B000002JS6|5.0|Ahh........the sound of my youth.  I am sure that just about anyone from my generation has heard every song on this album at least a couple of times.  Party anthem after party anthem.  The band basically has copied this formula on every album they have put out since this one.  The album starts out with \\"Hells Bells\\" and ends up with \\"Rock N Roll Aint Noise Pollution\\".  The album contains one of my favorites \\"Have A Drink On Me\\" (tribute to the late Bon Scott).  Some of the lyrics on the album are pretty bad, and the music is about as basic as it gets, but this one will always remain a classic rock n roll disc.
0345308239|5.0|Other reviewers have suggested that this is not one of Tuchman's best books.  This may not be a fair observation in comparison to \\"Guns of August\\" or \\"The Calamitous 14th Century\\".  Overall I found this book to be a concise and well-written work with the chapters well organized and consistent. <br /> <br />Some reviewers have pointed out that this book may have been intented to viel a criticism of the US war in Vietnam.  Whether that is the case or not, it seems evident that referring to the Vietnam war as folly is hardly controversial these days.  True, her points may be relevant to the current Iraq war, but I think that the larger point that she is trying to make is that folly applies to many political and military conflicts between nations.  If her comments apply to the Iraq war, could they not also apply to Serbia's Balkan wars, or Chechnya, or the UN's disjointed attempts at reining in North Korea or Iran?  Her points and concerns raised through these case examples are worth considering in modern times throughout dozens of current conflicts worldwide. <br /> <br />All in all, this is an excellent book.  fans of Tuchman or history in general will not be disappointed.
B000GCFO08|5.0|This movie was great! I love everything about this movie! I recommend this to anyone. I played the video games and never found them to be scary but this movie was!!
0375505091|5.0|If pictures are words, this is an epic novel in the tradition of Dickens or Tolstoy. Read carefully and bring along the tissues so that -when you reach the final chapters -  you won't leave the pages damp, as I did.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|All of their albums have been gold, takk is no different great album.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins has written his anti-theistic manifesto very carefully, without any pomposity or ostentation of words. It's long, but it's wonderfully clear, elegant, witty, and honest. Fun to read, in short, if you're already comfortable with the ideas. Profound and disturbing, if those ideas are outside your customary thoughts. Clearly this is a book well beyond the reading habits of most Americans, and that is its only weakness. Someone should adapt it for children, with appropriate illustrations, and someone else should write a Harvey Pekar comic book version. Dawkins obviously hopes his book will become a catalyst for paradigmatic intellectual change, but on what scale is such change possible? If, for example, all responsible astrophysicists would diligently isolate the Big Bang hypothesis from any hint of Creation Mythology... well, that would be a positive increment, wouldn't it? So read it, fellow non-theists, and enjoy it, and then PASS IT ALONG TO THOSE WHO MAY PROFIT FROM IT!<br /><br />Added later: In good conscience, I have to admit there's a lot about Richard Dawkins per se in this book, and some of it might come across as self-congratulatory. I CHOSE to take it as forthrightness. If you're moderately religious, American, or both, you'll have to accept a measure of British teasing, well-mannered ridicule, and jovial scorn to survive the reading. But it'll be good for you.
0446577383|4.0|I am new to Baldacci having read one other.  This was an awesome book.  Although the ending was a tad predictable, it was still a great read.  I recommend it to those who like suspense combined with a little terrorism and espionage.
1400079179|2.0|At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a \\"well isn't that contrite\\" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.<br /><br />Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,<br /><br />A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.
0307277887|4.0|Serial killer books can be so tiring to read now.  We've all read Thomas Harris' work, and by now, not much can compare.  (Okay, maybe Caleb Carr)  At any rate, Lindsay drops in and makes a splash.  Dexter is so unique that you can't help but like the guy, despite how he tends to spend some of his free time.  The character is fresh and exciting.  The plot also moves along at a blistering pace.  This is a book you can read on a Sunday afternoon in one sitting. <br />I only have two complaints on the novel.  When we find out who the killer is, it is sort of anti-climactic because it seems rather obvious about halfway through the book.  Not terrible, just a little too easy to guess.  Second, the ending.  I liked the ending and thought it fit the character all too well.  I just would like for it not be so....rushed.  It just kind of \\"happened,\\" and your kind of guessing as to what it was that really went on. <br />All in all, those points should not deter anyone from reading this book.  It is thoughtful, original, and above all darkly humorous. <br />In response to some of the negative reviews, I would like to point out that the \\"repeating\\" nature of Dexter seemed to fit the character well.  It seems that as a first person narrative, he would react that way when he was not in control of a situation.  \\"Did this really happen.  I mean...did this really happen???\\"  (That's not an official quote, just an example)  Dexter's character would be so bewildered by something so out of kilter with his \\"normal\\" life, that he would obsess over that fact, thus the repeating of himself.
B0000640VN|3.0|KATE & LEOPOLD isn't a very original film.  It has a predictable plotline and follows the same \\"fish out of water\\" routine that countless previous films followed.  Surprisingly, this doesn't work against the film; in fact, it works for it.  It's as if the film realizes that it's not original and it doesn't care - because it's not trying to be.  It's meant to be an enjoyable way to spend roughly two hours of your time, and that's what it is.    The plot involves Stuart (Liev Schreiber), a man from twentieth-century New York, somehow stumbling across a portal that allows him to travel through time (it's never explained just how he discovers this, just one of many large plot holes).  He travels to the early nineteenth-century, where he draws the attention of Leopold (Hugh Jackman), a duke bored with the life of the wealthy.  Leopold chases Stuart, and when Stuart returns to present-day New York, he accidentally brings Leopold with him.  Naturally, Leopold is at first horrified by his surroundings, but he gradually adapts to them while falling in love with Stuart's ex-girlfriend, career woman Kate (Meg Ryan).  Leopold must return to his time in a week; can love overcome the bounds of time?    The script, by Steven Rogers and director James Mangold (GIRL, INTERRUPTED) based on a story by Rogers, is nothing too great.  There's a noticeable lack of originality and an even more noticeable abundance of plot holes.  Mangold is apparently a talented director, but his directing adds little to the film.  So what holds it up?  The cast - in particular, Ryan and Jackman.  At first, casting Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan as a couple may sound like a ridiculous idea - it certainly did to me - but these talented actors make it work.  Ryan's performance isn't the highlight of her career, but it's definitely fun and likable.  Jackman's performance isn't a knockout either, but his masculine charm and sincerely chivalrous attitude are irresistible nonetheless.  Schreiber, Breckin Meyer, and Natasha Lyonne are great in supporting roles.    Along with the charming performances of the cast, there's some great production design and costumes in the nineteenth-century scenes, as well as a fittingly dreamy song by Sting.  And though that's really all the film has going for it, it's enough.  KATE & LEOPOLD isn't brilliant, it's not even clever, but its charisma and simple romance will be enough for anyone seeking an enjoyable, easy-to-follow rom-com.
B000GPIPD8|3.0|Focus: that's the element that seems to be missing from The Black Keys' latest long-player, their fourth album in all. The blues-rockin' riffs, courtesy of Dan Auerbach, are present and correct, and Patrick Carney's drums are rarely less than suitably bombastic, but Magic Potion suffers, rather, from alarming dips in concentration. For every romper-stomper of a four-minute fuzz-soaked foot-stamper, there's a meandering exercise in mediocrity just around the metaphysical bend.<br /><br />Opener \\"Just Got to Be\\" sets an impressive tone: the listener can picture Auerbach leaning back, arching his spine, as he pummels heavy-duty riffs from his instrument of choice. His voice, soaked in soul and spirit (by which I mean liquor, obviously), is the perfect accompaniment to music like this: with raw instrumentation must come vocals from a boozy backwater only discovered by city folk sometime at the end of the last decade, at the very earliest, and Auerbach never disappoints on this particular front. But, well... there is always a \\"but\\" where albums that don't wholly grab their audience are concerned.<br /><br />If Magic Potion was a six-track EP, featuring the aforementioned accompanied by \\"Your Touch\\" and \\"Just a Little Heat\\", to name but a pair of standouts, then we'd be in business: accolades would come the duo's way easily, and I would be in no position to disagree with the acclaim such a brief, such a focused, collection would attract. But the slumps that pepper this eleven-tracker leave an unwelcome taste in the mouth, an irritating resonance in the ears. \\"You're the One\\" is such a song: although it represents the band's softer side, compositionally, it also bores this listener's opinion into a state of absolute indifference. Which is, perhaps, a feeling even worse than hating the song with utmost vehemence. It just limply swaggers by, filling its three-and-something minutes with characteristic repetition but zero energy.<br /><br />Perhaps the record's length doesn't help - at 42 minutes, Magic Potion is probably ten minutes longer than its simplistic style warrants - but come the concluding pair of \\"Back Door\\" and \\"Elevator\\", it's tough to muster much in the way of excitement for heard-it-before (across the last nine songs) six-string crunches and heavy-handed cymbal crashes.

0060899190|5.0|My dad bought me this book because I made him go to the PostSecret Exhibit in Reading, Pa. He didn't know what it was going into and after seeing the exhibit and reading the book, he left in complete tears. This book is wonderful because it's like re-visiting the exibit over and over again. There is something very powerful about how reading other peoples secrets makes you realize how you are not alone. This is a book of humanity. So worth it.
B000002JSJ|4.0|There are several things I could say about \\"Presence\\" but I think the most powerful one for me personally is that it was the last album Zeppelin played live in the USA. (They had an extensive North American tour scheduled for the fall of 1979, that coincided with the release of \\"In Through the Out Door\\" but that was canceled when Bonham OD'd) Having heard Jimmy Page play \\"Nobody's Fault but Mine\\" live at MSG, standing inside a green laser pyramid, which turned in beat to the bass line, I will always regard it as one of the best hard-rock songs ever. Plant's voice was excellent that night too as he \\"dueled\\" with Page, using his voice to produce the same notes Page was playing on his guitar. Whatever you may hear about the band - on all but their \\"Physical Grafitti\\" tour - they were a superb live act.

This manual has a lot going for it.<br /><br />It is a practical step-by-step manual with clear pictures illustrating every posture, with a descriptive teaching of the postures.<br /><br />David covers the basics, intermediate, right through to the full flow with 263 pages of Davids yoga and teachings.<br /><br />I reccomend this book to anyone starting out in yoga, (in particular) because it does give visual learners good pictures to grasp and learn from.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|The \\"original\\" versions are 4x3 letterboxed... <br /> <br />For anyone with an HDTV or widescreen regular TV, these DVDs are a major disappointment.  The original versions are matted from their original 2.35:1 aspect ration for 4x3 TVs, so they look like crud on an HDTV or other widescreen TV. <br /> <br />They appear to be made from the same transfers used for the laserdiscs. <br /> <br />The other versions, from 2004, appear to be identical to the DVDs previously released.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|The Open Door is blazingly awesome! All the new sounds incorporated with some familiar territory from Fallen plus Amy Lee's even MORE amazing voice is just mind blowing! I first caught onto Evanescence with the song \\"Bring Me to Life\\", Amy's voice was one i had never heard before, uniquely beautiful. On TOD, Amy continues and enhances her talent for 'singing tears', as I put it, and all the influence of DJ Lethal make this record kind of 3-D, very well done. It's all it's cracked up to be and more. Big fans of \\"Fallen\\" should love this one as well, for a sophomore album, this is a T.K.O.! Ballads and rock to screamingly soothe the soul of anyone who can relate, The Open Door is just Awesome!
B000FTWB7G|1.0|This album is lame, bland, and the production is horrible. First off this isn't Evanescence. It's a whole new band with Amy singing. This is like a David Lee Roth solo album after Van Halen. Or worse a Scott Stap solo album without Creed. Yeah it's that bad. Every single melody is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stretched out. So boring. New guitar player was in Limp Bisket, that should tell you how much he sucks. The band blows, songs are horrible,and its' just a waste of money. Why else is it selling for $9 ? lol. THEY ARE DONE!
B000F8O35U|5.0|Finally, the long-anticipated eighth addition to Disney's Platinum Collection is here making quite the splash---the bonus tracks in this disc-disc edition include a brand-new making-of feautrette, never-before-deleted scenes, a backstage peek into the world of Imagineering, music videos, special effect demos,  and song demos. We often wondered how Ursula ended up a sea witch (some others calling the multi-tentacled terror an \\"octopus\\"); one of our favorite deleted scenes reveals Ursula's real identity . . . unless you've been basking in a seaweed wrap all these years, Ursula is voiced by the Cape's own Pat Carroll. Getting it done has never sounded so true. And terrifying.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am another long-time Austen fan of both the book and every screen adaptation available (including the much-loved Colin Firth BBC version).  <br />I couldn't imagine how they could reduce it to 2 hours -- but they have done a beautiful job of using film for it's best features. For example, the dance sequences and the roving camera-work show vignettes with key characters that would take much verbal exposition to explain. <br />The scenery is breathtaking.  The Bennet farm is fascinating. <br /> <br />I also didn't think anyone could be better than Colin Firth, but I am now a fan of Matthew Macfayden because of this film. He comes on slowly but intensely. I've now sought out other work he has done.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I won't add to the voluminous praise that already exists in abundance on Amazon that speaks so eloquently of this film.  I agree totally with everything written here stemming from a positive vibe, man.  This is one of my favorite movies.  Certainly my favorite Coen Brothers movie in their comedic body of work, even bypassing \\"Raisng Arizona\\" (which I think is a masterpiece as well).<br /><br />What I think I might be able to add is a paraphrase from Kevin Spacey when he was being interviewed by Leo LaPorte on a now defunct show called \\"The Screen Savers\\" on a now equally dead network called TechTV.<br /><br />Spacey is a personal friend of Jeff Bridges who plays \\"The Dude\\" in \\"The Big Lebowski\\", and as the two of them (Spacey and LaPorte) were discussing the topic of hi-tech cameras, and the special photographs that Jeff Bridges was taking, the subject of the character of \\"The Dude\\" came up.  Kevin Spacey told Leo that if he wanted to know what Jeff Bridges was like, all he had to do was watch \\"The Big Lebowski\\", because Jeff was essentially \\"The Dude\\".  I really wish YouTube had it in stock. It was far out, to use the parlance of our times.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way way...that rug really did tie the room together. Did it not?
B000F5GNX8|4.0|There is something about this movie that makes people want to write reviews longer than the tax code but suffice to say, if you've seen enough Hollywood action spectaculars to realize how silly they are, you can't help but enjoy KKBB.  Its well written, everybody in it is perfectly cast and its surprisingly easy to follow for an intentionally non-linear mess.  It also manages to be funny and exciting while being totally absurd.<br /><br />The plot is intentionally too complex, the coincidences utterly implausible, the stunts are laughably over the top.  But that's the idea.  After seeing so many movies with \\"messages\\" about good, evil, life, death and infinity (usually based on comic books) its refreshing to something that's all in fun.  This is one movie where both the actors and the audience get to have a really good time.
0060558121|3.0|There are already many reviews that cover the story and characters, so I'm not going to waste our time with that. Instead I'll give my opinions on the actual writing and style of the story. Overall, I thought it to be good, with a lot of potential, but could have been much better. There were three things I didn't like, and which kept me from rating it as a 4 or even 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />First, I thought the characters were way too shallow at times. I understand the two main characters are supposed to be secretive and mysterious. I am not talking about that. What I mean is that there are many points in the story where the supporting characters don't react strongly enough and the dialog is short and flat. The end climax of the story is an example of this, for anyone who has read it. There is good build-up, but then the characters just fizzle and puff, when there should be a lot more emotion, conflict, and dialog. Thankfully this problem doesn't seem to happen with Niel Gaimon's later book in this series: Anansi Boys, which I liked much more.<br /><br />Next, The story slowed down and dragged on because of too much unnecessary detail and side stories. There was the large side story of Lakeside, and there were some times in that story that detail when it really wasn't needed. But overall I liked the Lakeside side story and thought it was a good addition to the main story. What I am really complaining about are the many \\"flashbacks\\" that try to give background information on some of the gods and spirits that the main characters meet. The flashbacks could have been useful and entertaining if they had just been much, much shorter. Do I really need to read page after page about a girl from the British isles who becomes an escaped convict and flees to America in order to learn that her people have brought Irish myths with them to the New World? One page at most would have sufficed.<br /><br />Lastly, The use of sex was just too excessive and improper. Now, I must confess I am a bit conservative when it comes to sex, but not a lot. I'm certainly not a prude. My problem here is that I consider seemingly random, excessive use of sex by authors as a crude crutch that they rely on when they can't be creative enough, and that dilutes from the main story. It seems that many authors, including Niel Gaimon with this novel, just sat down after writing the story and thought \\"hm.. maybe I'll insert a vulgar scene with a prostitute here\\" or \\"ha! A really random detailed gay sex scene here would really shock the readers! How genius of me!\\". Don't get me wrong. If this sort of thing actually was part of the main story and development of the characters, I would be fine with it. But when these sorts of things are seemingly inserted at random, without any reason for character or story development, and inserted quite frequently (almost every chapter, it seemed at times), then it really distracts rather than adds. Again, thankfully this isn't the case with his later novel, Anansi Boys.<br /><br />I would recommend reading this growing \\"world\\" that Niel Gaimon is creating, and therefore read American Gods. But I would actually suggest doing the same thing I did: read Anansi Boys first, then go back and read American Gods. You won't loose any information, and Anansi Boys is a better and easier read. Gift Idea: Because of the very graphic sex and violence, you may not want to give this to someone you are not sure is mature enough, just to warn you (18+ should be good enough, in my conservative opinion).rvative when it comes to sex, but not a lot.

B000F39MAQ|2.0|I mean, really, people -- what can one say about a \\"Traviata\\" that takes place inside a tube of toothpaste?<br /><br />I'm all for directors taking a \\"new\\" approach to the classics.  Anyone who wants to see this done with imagination, class, taste and a suberb sense of artistry has only to come to New York to see Anthony Minghella's dazzling production of \\"Madama Butterfly\\" at the Met.  And Chereau proved years ago that a modern approach to Wagner could be both illuminating and relevant.<br /><br />But director Willy Decker shows neither imagination nor artistry in this ham-fisted production.  There's not a single moment of emotional honesty represented on stage, which pretty much disallows the viewer from becoming involved with the characters and their fate.  To the detriment of all, Decker puts no trust in his singers, his conductor, and most particularly, not Verdi.  Netrebko and Villazon both sound magnificent, but they're never allowed to stand still and simply sing.  Instead they're too busy running around, flirting, agonizing, emoting wildly; lounging on or falling over or jumping up and down on the many couches that make up the set, kissing each other's feet.<br /><br />Having been lucky enough to see Villazon & Netrebko in their one and only performance of \\"Boheme\\" at the Met, I know firsthand how mesmerizing they can be together.  Netrebko, as Mimi, through superb, subtle artistry and singing, conveyed her fears about mortality and the passage of time without trying to turn back the hands of an enormous clock.  (A subtle metaphor, no?)  Admittedly, the Zeffirelli production is just too large, and does as much a disservice to the piece as does Willy Decker in this \\"Traviata.\\"  But at least Zeffirelli directed \\"Boheme\\"; he didn't impose a concept on the piece that isn't supported by the text or score.<br /><br />For instance, who's that old guy following Violetta around all the time?  Is he the personification of Death, Time; is he supposed to be Verdi?  Or maybe he's Grizzly Adams; I have no idea.  Adding silent characters, as far as I'm concerned, is a sure sign that a director has no clue what to do with a piece, or how to convey his or her \\"ideas\\" about it.  Had Verdi and Piave wanted Violetta shadowed by the ghost of Kenny Rogers, I trust that they were brilliant enough artists to have written him in themselves.<br /><br />Am I promoting literal directorial translations only?  Of course not.  Robert Carsen's \\"Eugene Onegin\\" is stark, abstract, at times even surreal, but it enhances and illuminates the score and text in stunning ways.  On the other hand, his \\"Rusalka,\\" in which the prince is singing about being lost in a forest while in actuality he's standing in the middle of a large European hotel room, is absurd and distracting.<br /><br />Look, when I go to see Verdi's \\"Traviata,\\" I'd like to see Verdi's \\"Traviata.\\"  Willy Decker's \\"Traviata\\" is not an opera I'm familiar with.have no idea.

B000002LBH|5.0|It sounds cheesy, doesn't it, stating LTB is the quintescential Smiths album. I remember listening to the Beatles over and OVER and OVER again and my mother telling me that they were the perfect band, that no one else would be able to take their place. I hated her for that. It felt like she had stolen something necessary for growing up. Can't describe the feeling, kind of a jealousy that festered. <br /> <br />So, in rebellion, I listened to Debbie Gibson and other pop sycophants and symbols of the time, finally deciding that George Micheal was as fine a point of where music of the 80s would have to leave its mark. My on-again, off-again girlfriend at the moment convinced me one fine, fall day to take a listen to the LTB tape she constantly carried in her back pocket. Three days later, she was shacking up with a greaser to whom I loathed, but who had a car, leaving me with my moody depression, piles of crisp golden and orange leaves and two more years of high school, and a well used Smiths Louder Than Bombs long playing tape.  <br /> <br />Morrisey's amazing voice and lyrical talent, coupled with Johnny Marr's amazing guitar feeds, Andy Rourke's back beat and Mike Joyce keeping the rhthym really fit the mood I was in. Each song reminded me of different things; mostly Shakespearean, long train rides, James Dean, and cool, windy, rainy days in which one tends to curl up with a small book of Keats or Yeats and enjoys being alone. Each song seemed crafted, not produced. Very real and raw. Immensely wonderful.  <br /> <br />Yeah, I know, three letters. G - A - Y. Still, I loved the Smiths then, and every band I listen to and love now, such as Deathcab for Cutie, Dandy Worhols, the Doves, Jets Overhead, Coldplay, all seem molded by this little band as well. The Smiths were never huge by the Beatle's standards, although Morrissey continues to have a cult following as does Johnny Marr. It's fall again, the cool air has the aroma of rain, and Dead Poets Society becomes my favorite movie again. The tape has long ago fallen to the ravages of play and time, but I have a well worn CD that I still cherish. <br /> <br />

0375703861|5.0|I don't know where to start! This novel is a pager turner of an incredible story with an abyss of emotional depth that will leave the reader spent, shaken out of his or her wooden workaday existence. The descriptions of the dust-bowl and the Depression (the period following the stock market crash of 1929) made me weep more than once. The cast of characters calls to mind Dickens, and the presence of artificial limbs is outright Melvillian. Features also the excellent use of a fey man as the embodiment of a wooden, post-columbian textual figure. A must for teachers, students and parents who care about the rainforest. <br /> <br />I just bought three of these to give out as birthday presents this year. And plan to buy more for Christmas. This is definitely a heartbreaking work of incredible genius. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000FTWB7G|4.0|First, let me say that this is a very good album.  So good, in fact, that it's easily better than 3/4 of the cookie-cutter rock that's out today.  Amy Lee's haunting, ethereal voice punctuates the roaring guitars and thundering drums perfectly (\\"Snow White Queen\\" and \\"Cloud Nine\\" are excellent examples) -- but she's also capable of putting together a much softer, more intimate cut like the exceptional \\"Good Enough.\\" <br /> <br />Having said that, however, there's a disturbing lack of variety when you listen to the album as a whole.  Each cut is very good on its own, but they start to sound very similar to each other on a complete listen.  Unlike \\"Fallen\\" with its tremendous peaks and valleys of unique sounds, this Evanescence album is the foothills that never quite reach the same heights or valleys of originality. <br /> <br />Still, a very good album and a solid follow-up to something truly exceptional.
B000G759LW|5.0|This is a great cd for everything and its style!... I've always loved christina for her voice... she's got one of those rare voices you can't get from anywhere... like mariah... but when i listened to this cd, i just fell in love with her GREAT ballad \\"Save Me From Myself\\"... this is dedicated to her husband and all by herself... I LOVE this track.... it is so fresh... and i love how sultry it sounds... christina really turns my head on this one... thank you for this song! i dedicate it to my husband too... because it is sooo how i feel too.. and that track 9 also... right after it, the Right Man... great power...
B000FTWB7G|5.0|This cd is awesome! I always wondered how they would possibly come close to Fallen.  Hard to pick a favorite on this cd.  It is loaded.  Even though Call Me When You're Sober is a good song it is not close to the best on this work.  Lithium, Lacrymosa, The Only One are amongst my favs. <br />Enjoy!
B00005JPAD|5.0|This is a fantastic film, perhaps the best I've seen this year!  Martin Scorsese creates a current masterpiece with two strong protagonist/antagonists, an ensemble cast, great ironies, and plot twists.   <br /> <br />Scorsese effectively one-ups the current generation of filmmakers and shows them how to shoot a real picture!
B000AU9UYM|5.0|After years of believing 1989's Batman with Michael Keaton was the best Batman movie out of the four Burton/Schumacher films, there is now a clear cut winner, and those four do not make the final cut.  Not even close.    Batman Begins is the movie fans of the franchise have been waiting for.  It is dark, exciting, and gives a real feel to the man behind the mask, Bruce Wayne, as well as Gotham City overall.  The best thing about this movie is its plot and its acting.  Christian Bale is great as the Dark Knight (which will be the title of the 2008 sequel), Liam Neeson is a cruel villain as he should be, and Michael Caine is fantastic as Wayne's  witty and supportive butler, Alfred.    This movie captures what the previous films of the Burton/Schumacher films failed to capture, and that is Batman's hard fight for justice in Gotham, no matter what the cost.  In addition, this film is basic with regard to Batman's gadgets (batmobile, grappling gun, cape etc.) and makes Batman's character believable.  Some may say that the Batmobile jumping off roof tops was farfetched, but that's how it was in the comics.    Overall, Batman Begins was a great movie and brought credibility back to a franchise that had absolutely none thanks to Joel Schumacher and Akiva Goldsman's disastrous \\"Batman & Robin\\".  The movie reminded me very much of the Fox Kids animated series that aired in the early to mid '90's, which was an excellent series and really not meant for kids under the age of 10.  Many adults even argued that it was for them.    Bottom Line: Great movie.  Buy the 2-disc Deluxe Edition DVD.  Has lots of features and commentaries about the movie.  Very cool stuff.

Iron Maiden's greatest Album was Powerslave and Piece Of mind. A brave New World and Dance of Death were both masterpieces as well. I will give Maiden an A+ for depth on this one. This is maiden's deepest release to date. Nice work Maiden!
B0000524CY|5.0|I don't care whether you post this review or not.  Everybody talks about how scary this movie is.  It didn't scare me.  Everybody talks about faith.  I have none.  Everybody talks about how it makes you THINK!  Think about WHAT???  It's a good flick, in its day it was a great one.  I avoid horror movies like the plague.  I've only seen 2 others.  \\"The Omen\\" (suckered into it by my liking for Gregory Peck, it upset the hell out of me, god had nothing to do with it, it was things like people getting their head cut off! I've hated Gregory Peck (\\"Arabesque,\\" \\"Moby Dick\\" and all) ever since) and \\"The Revenge of Frankenstein\\" which I saw when I was 10 years old and was in a state of terror and horror for days afterwards.  These were trash.  \\"The Exorcist\\" had some class.  But it's well to remember that this is nothing but a movie.  It is not a documentary of science failing and religion saving the day.  It is a movie!  It's not the holy grail.  It's not even holy.  Except the little rows of punched out squares along either side of the celluloid.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I am an avid fan of the 1995 A&E/BBC version of Pride and Prejudice starring Colin Firth.  And so, I had my reservations about giving this one a whirl.  Most of Hollywood's literary adaptations are underdeveloped, underwhelming and downright superficial.  Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow springs to mind.  However, this 2005 adaptation directed by Joe Wright and adapted by Deborah Moggach, while not better than the 1995 version, is definitely more enjoyable than the bunch.  (Warning: there will be more comparisons between this version and the 1995 version.  So, if you're tired of reading comparisons between those two, then I suggest you skip reading this review.)  The cinematography is gorgeous -- the scenery and sets are a major eyeful.  The film direction is one of the best I've seen.  Wright has done a splendid job.  The music score is one of the best I've heard.  I especially love \\"Dawn,\\" the one played in the beginning of the movie.  It is absolutely beautiful. The wardrobe, however, is a disappointment.  The gowns (more Georgian than Regency) are not appropriate for the time.  Elizabeth Bennet would have never attended the Netherfield ball without wearing gloves and Caroline Bingley's sleeveless slip dress with a plunging neckline is downright anachronistic.  Not only does it look too modern, a noble lady would have never worn such a flimsy gown at a formal ball unless she was some sort of daring widow wanting to cause a scandal.  The gowns Mrs. Bennet and Lady Catherine de Bourgh wore were at least two decades or so out of style.  And I won't even comment on Judy Dench's hairstyle except for one expression: yikes!  That hairdo was fashionable in the 1750s -- at least sixty years before Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice.  The quality of the characterization varies from person to person. I do not like Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet.  Knightley does not show the right amount of sharp wit, intelligence and conflicting emotions that makes Miss Bennet one of the most endearing heroines in literature.  The director concentrates more on Knightley's pretty face than on focusing on the character's complexities.  This Elizabeth is too petulant and giggly for my taste.  Jennifer Ehle had a better grasp of the character.  I did not like Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet.  He comes across more as a cynical, laid-back loner than the sarcastic and witty character in the book, qualities that were passed on to Elizabeth.  (By the way, I found it odd that in this film Mr. Bennet and Lizzy do not have the kind of closeness and affection that is required in their roles.)  Also, his imitation of an English accent is simply awful.  I wish Benjamin Whitrow had been cast in this version as well.  I also liked the actor who played Mr. Collins in the '95 version better than Tom Hollander.  Even though Hollander was wonderful in BBC's Wives and Daughters, I feel he was miscast as Mr. Collins.  The actors who played Mrs. Bennet, Jane, Mr. Bingley, Caroline Bingley, Lydia and Kitty do a good job, but somehow aren't as colorful as the ones in the 1995 miniseries.  And last, but definitely not least, is Matthew Macfadyen as the dark, handsome, proud and brooding Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />I don't think I'm being biased when I say that, while Macfadyen does some wonderful scenes in which Darcy shows his longing for Elizabeth, he in no way outshadows Colin Firth's performance.  Firth was able to transmit Mr. Darcy's complexities and conflicting emotions in almost a flawless way.  He also convinced me that Mr. Darcy was indeed rude and proud, or at least seemed that way from Elizabeth's perspective, and Macfadyen's Mr. Darcy comes across more as shy and awkward than anything else, which would have been fine, but then why would he be so against Elizabeth's poor connections and convince Mr. Bingley that Jane isn't the one for him?  The one thing Macfadyen was able to convey better than Firth was his love and desire for Elizabeth.  (Actually, I thought Firth's subtle approach to Darcy's feelings and sexual tension for Lizzy was more dead on.  Macfadyen's approach is more blatant and in-your-face.)  This film's Darcy appearing without a cravat in the last scenes has a nice, sensual touch, but it's nothing like Firth jumping on the lake and then walking back to Pemberley in wet clothes.  Anyway, as for the rest of the film, due to time constraints, many scenes are glossed over, including the whole Lydia and Mr. Wickham debacle.  In fact, Mr. Wickham, such an integral character in the story, appears only in two or three scenes! There are also some characters that are eliminated altogether, like Mr. Bingley's married sister (who was supposed to be Miss Bingley's chaperone.  Miss Bingley would have never stayed at a house alone with two single men, even if one of them was her brother).  And what can I say about this version's Miss Caroline Bingley except that all she does is scowl, purse her lips and look conceited?  Anna Chancellor of the 1995 version may not be as attractive as Kelly Reilly, but she was definitely better developed.  In fact, the characters and storyline were better developed in the 1995 version.  Then again, the miniseries had eight episodes, plenty of time to be true to the novel.  Also, this version is not as centered on humor as it should have been.  This version is more solemn and everything and everyone centers on Elizabeth.  Then there are the anachronisms.  Mr. Bingley would have never entered the private chambers of a female guest, Elizabeth would have never walked around the village with her hair undone, Mr. Darcy would have never entered Elizabeth's bedroom (without wearing a cravat) to hand her a letter, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh would never pay a visit in the middle of the night.  Perhaps these details are negligible to some, but not for me.  Period accuracy is very important to me.  All in all, despite all the flaws I mentioned regarding the cast and condensed plot due to the limited 129-minute format, this adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is still worth watching and owning, which is why I give it four stars.  The last scenes are wonderful and romantic (if a bit corny), perfect for fans of period pieces with modern-day sensitivities.  The DVD is also wonderful -- great audio and video with wonderful special features.  I highly recommend it.  And, if you haven't watched it, please get the A&E/BBC production starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle if you long for a truer adaptation of Austen's literary classic.  That goes without saying, but I had to anyway. :-)le approach to Darcy's feelings and sexual tension for Lizzy was more dead on.  Macfadyen's approach is more blatant and in-your-face.)  This film's Darcy appearing without a cravat in the last scenes has a nice, sensual touch, but it's nothing like Firth jumping on the lake and then walking back to Pemberley in wet clothes.  Anyway, as for the rest of the film, due to time constraints, many scenes are glossed over, including the whole Lydia and Mr. Wickham debacle.  In fact, Mr. Wickham, such an integral character in the story, appears only in two or three scenes! There are also some characters that are eliminated altogether, like Mr. Bingley's married sister (who was supposed to be Miss Bingley's chaperone.  Miss Bingley would have never stayed at a house alone with two single men, even if one of them was her brother).  And what can I say about this version's Miss Caroline Bingley except that all she does is scowl, purse her lips and look conceited?

B0000032LS|5.0|As a seven-year-old I can remember going to my Nana's house on Saturday nights. It seems that my parents were caught in the craze of 1975, The Rocky Horror Picture Show.    It's the story of Janet Weiss (whyysssssss) and Brad Majors (as@h*le) and one strange night out (it was a night in) it was a night OUT!    Of course if you have not seen the movie in a theater at midnight the above paragraph may seem a bit odd and granted has little to do with the soundtrack, but just thinking about it brings back my own teenage experiences in the midnight showings of the eighties.    On to the music!! This is a rock solid album (Oh yeah baby...this little number came in vinyl) which has been stolen from my car tape deck many times. I can not say enough good things about  the musical that Riff Raff has written for us. Tim Curry as Doctor Frankenfurter is brilliantly cast as the perfect voice for a \\"Sweet Transvestite\\".    It's been decades and I still have songs from this soundtrack get stuck in my head all the time. Buy it, if your looking at it you know what it is and you know you want it.    And if you in Harvard Square in the hamlet of Cambridge, MA on a chilly fall Saturday night, poke around and you'll find the Rocky Horror Picture Show Playing at the Loew's Cineplex. Rumor has it, it starts at Midnight. It's the best $8.50 you'll ever spend. Well maybe not ever spend, but it's not that much.
B000ENWKN8|2.0|DUDE?!?! What happened, when i heard about a new Zombie cd i was like O YEA! and then when i heard foxy foxy i was like WTF?? What happened to Hellbilly and Sinister kind of music?? I dont know what happened but, I'll admit theres a few decent songs like Let It All Bleed Out and The Scorpion Sleeps, but WTF?!?!?!?!? <br />
B000H0MKOC|3.0|\\"Thank You for Smoking\\" is a mixed bag, mixing sharp observations about the American Political System with occasional droll humor... but it fails to realize its full potential for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First and foremost, it is ambivalent as to whether the lead character, Nick Naylor, is a hero or a villain.  Personally, I liked a lot of what he had to say about freedom of choice, but the way it was presented, it seemed that the movie was mocking those sentiments. Of course, the liberal do-gooders also get their fair share of mocking, but ultimately the movie lacks a point of view.<br /><br />Second, I found it odd that although a crucial plot development centers on the fact that Nick would have to be a fairly heavy smoker to survive one particular event, he is never shown actually smoking. In fact, hardly anybody smokes throughout the entire movie, including all the tobacco industry people.<br /><br />Also, although I have no problem with profanity or \\"bad language\\" when it serves a real purpose, I thought they used the \\"f\\" word far too often in this movie, when it didn't serve a purpose.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but not as much as I thought I would. I'd give it 3.5 stars if that were an option; I'm going with 3 to bring the average down from its current 4-star level.  (I thought the funniest moment was in one of the deleted scenes, where the tobacco guys are considering various versions of a skull-and-crossbones logo. They should have left this in the movie!)
0895260131|1.0|Review of The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) by Robert Spencer.<br />I am a Muslim by birth and have researched and followed the principles of the Faith to the best of my abilities.<br />I am a published author and my book, ISBN 1-4107-3272-X, available from any bookseller on order or AMAZON.COM has been very well received and acknowledged by numerous United States' Governors; Honorable Members of the Congress and the Senators. Some of them have highly praised its contents and the chronological manner in which AL-ISLAM has been explained for the benefit of those who know little or nothing about this ever-expanding and fastest growing Faith.<br />[...]:-<br /> The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades).<br />It would be a gross injustice and disservice, on the part of the booksellers and Amazon.Com, to conceal the following facts from the purchasers' of these books from them.<br />Almost all the Editorial Reviews of The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) have claimed its contents to be well-researched and authoritative? It would be of a great interest to learn from these \\"Expert Authors\\" \\"Historians\\" and \\"Buglers who are constantly crying Afoul\\" to truly and realistically explain what does the word \\"ISLAM\\" mean and imply? For the information of those who would like to learn, is that; ISLAM or AL-ISLAM means, PEACE with total and complete Submission and Praising at all times The One and the Only Creator of this Life, Universe and what is visible and invisible to the inhabitants of this Universe. This Deity is most commonly known as GOD; spelt with a capital G. All the Creations are obliged to accept and be submissive to God. That and only that is the meaning and practice of ISLAM. Bearing this in mind it would be of great interest for everyone to know if the author Robert Spencer and the reviewers Michelle Malkin, Ibn Warraq, Walid Phares, Bat Ye'or and Bruce Thornton can name any Prophet or Messenger, (There have been more than 124,000 as is known from the Books, The Testaments, The Torah, The Bible and The Quran) who had ever denied this fact and said otherwise about God or Islam?. Only a few names would suffice! Therefore it is incorrect to say that the Last Prophet Muhammad (SAW) \\"introduced\\" ISLAM. As a matter of fact the Last Prophet Muhammad (SAW) only fully explained, exhibited by practice, and presented the final Islamic guidance, for the entire humanity. It is a fact that AL-ISLAM was the Faith that was initiated when Prophet Adam (AS) was sent to inhabit this universe. Therefore it would not be wrong to emphasize that God Demands (1) Total and full submission to Him, (2) That ALL His Messages and Revelations sent through all His Prophets and Messengers, starting with the First Prophet Adam (AS) were meant to guide the humanity in existence during the life time of the Prophet or the Messenger concerned. These revelations were memorized and passed on to the following generations. However as is no doubt known that the human-mind is the \\"devils' workshop\\"! The people started changing These Original Revelations to suit the needs of the few powerful ones; the purpose was to dominate and subjugate the true believers, who were Muslims! These human practices of changing reversed majority of The Original Revelations and sent majority of those generations and ones who followed them towards the satanic leanings under the watchful supervision of the Satan! The Books, The Zaboor, The Torah and The Bible also had the Original Revelations changed to suit the Powerfuls of the time. This practice is unreservedly continuing to this day under the guise of \\"Modernizations\\"! The Last Prophet and Messenger, Muhammad (SAW) was Directed by Allah (SWT) to liberate his people from the powerful yokes of the ruthless cultural-darkness and total ignorance of any social orders. His (SAW) mission was not any easier than any of his predecessor Prophets and the Messengers. He and his followers suffered cruel and in some cases fatal punishments. The Holy Quran was revealed to him in Verses which were recorded by his followers. The Holy Quran defines the rightful and the true paths which will lead the believers towards Heaven for the Eternal Life hereafter. At the same time The Holy Quran also defines those sinful and wrong paths which will take the non-believers towards their Eternal Life in Hell! Quite simply AL-ISLAM means full acceptance of the Revelations of Allah (SWT) in their Original Form in The Books, The Zaboor, The Torah, The Bible and The Quran; And the Total Belief that ALL The Prophets and The Messengers, from the First Prophet Adam to the Last Prophet and Messenger Muhammad were sent by Almighty Allah (SWT) to deliver His Message as The True Faith for all the Humanity. Therefore there will be no more Prophets after the Last Prophet and the Messenger Muhammad. Only Prophet JESUS (EISA AS) will return to this Universe to finally prepare The Humanity for the End of This Universe! The followers of the Religious-Faith accept the Messages and do not demand proofs; they are believed to be the successful ones!<br />Repeated emphasis, by these reviewers, on the word \\"jihad\\" or \\"jihadists\\" reflects total ignorance and the meaning of this word. The word Jihad means \\"total struggle against any action which is meant to prevent or obstruct the total and full submissions to the Will of God\\". The first and the foremost jihad is the inner human struggle, against the satanic influence, to pursue the rightist path which will lead towards God! Classical examples of personal-jihad include the actions of Prophet Abraham (Ibrahim AS) when he vigorously struggled against his father and family-members who were idolaters. Prophet Abraham remained steadfast on his path and continued on his mission of delivering Islamic guidance for the tribes and nations of the time and also for those generations who were to follow them. The sons of Prophet Jacob (Yaqub AS) launched a war of jihad against the tribesmen of Shechem son of Hamor. They were non-believers and the jihad was meant, to punish those tribesmen for an unjust event of a rape. Prophet Job (Ayoub AS) lost all his possessions and endangered his physical health when he struggled against the indoctrination of the Satan. Prophet Moses (Musa AS) led war-campaigns of jihad against the non-believer-nations of Canaanites and the Hittites. Prophet David (Dawood AS) led the jihad against the non-believing armies of the Philistines and killed Goliath. Prophet Solomon (Suleiman AS) warned of jihad against the people of the adjoining nations, who were worshippers of Sun and ruled by Queen of Sheba. This nation was to either abandon their worship of the sun or face the Religious Submission at the hands of his powerful army. The Last Prophet Muhammad (SAW) fought (jihad)  in the valley of Badr against his own relatives, kith and kin who were preventing Prophet Muhammad (SAW) from Delivering The Righteous Message of Islam.  All the wars which followed were those which had been imposed on the Believers! Human Historical facts have conclusively proven that all the campaigns to subjugate and to suppress Islam; have never succeeded. On the contrary these very campaigns, against AL-ISLAM have substantially contributed towards the growth and the universal expansion of The Faith: Islam!and in some cases fatal punishments. The Holy Quran was revealed to him in Verses which were recorded by his followers.

B000HT386M|1.0|\\"Click\\" is a hodgepodge of ideas stolen from \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", \\"A Christmas Carol\\", \\"Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"Back to the Future\\".  It starts off as a fairly pleasant typical Adam Sandler (looking old and drained these days) comedy and ending up as a melodramatic, tragic and sentimental soap opera.  The movie reminded me of \\"For the Boys\\" with Bette Midler, not in subject matter, but in its similarity in tone.  That movie by started out as a musical comedy and ending up as a tragic melodrama.  The contrast in both movies is just too jarring, leaving the viewer cold.   <br /> <br />Personally, I think Adam Sandler is getting too old for this sort of nonsense.  He has not really matured as an actor in the same manner as, say, Robin Williams, and would be wise to take some acting lessons or stick to producing. <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|After a civil war in which the good guys lost to the imperial dictatorship ov the Xteenth Reich, the weary war heros of the losing good side, have to hide like the maquis from an imperial navy, from the police of a police state, from the imperial gestapo, from the mafioso, and from the secret gene police who hide themselves even from their own people. <br />These reluctant heros chase hazardous missions, cargos, and various criminals that need removal by whatever means. <br />Their odyessy will never end, but the series was too good for the rest of drek TV and so it got the Ax and there was no fan revolution to save it Star Trek style.  ABC Fox Disney is a lot more powerful negatively than NBC Warner was.
B0000013GT|5.0|After their first release came out I was convinced that I would not hear them reach that peak again. I am so glad I was wrong. Just as creative as their 1st, the beats are imaginative and the lyrical abilities both MC's display is nothing less than perfect. If you could have only one OUTKAST record, this would be it! Peace.
B000G8NY4U|4.0|I was there at Manadaly Bay the night this concert was filmed and had been waiting anxiously for nearly two years to see this concert again. And this DVD does not dissapoint. <br /> <br />This DVD contains most of the compositions from that concert and the DVD does an exellent job of capturing the energy that was radiating through the arena that evening. Watching the DVD was like taking me back to that night, reliving that awesome concert once again. This concert is slightly different from LATA and Tribute in that this is more of a variety, jamming type of concert than the more classical type of concert he did previously. I also thought Yanni had polished his music quite a bit since I last saw him in his ethnicity tour early 2004 at Raleigh-Durham.  <br /> <br />I gave it 4.5 stars only because Yanni cut out several of my favorite compositions from that concert...! Other than that, every Yanni fan should enjoy this DVD.
B000002KBD|3.0|Okay, I love Van but this isn't really much of a record. If you can find it cheap, I'd recommend it. But don't pay full price for it. There are quite a few good songs - Crazy Face, I've Been Working, Sweet Jannie and the hit Blue Money (annoying \\"Do do you do\\" refrain aside\\"). Then there are a couple of great songs: the downtempo I'll Be Your Lover Too and soaring Street Choir. And there's one excellent song: the big hit Domino, propelled by an excellent horn chart and funky beat. But there are a couple of issues. Van's never been much of a lyricist (it seems he spent most of his talents along those lines on Astral Weeks), and too many of these songs are pedestrian love tunes with predictable Moon/June/Spoon rhymes - If I Ever Needed Someone, for example. Also, there's a LOT of generic, faceless R&B - Give Me a Kiss, Call Me Up In Dreamland and Gypsy Queen, namely. It gets worse. Virgo Clowns is one of the most annoying songs this guy ever attempted, and Gypsy Queen suffers from an awkward falsetto (the same he would later employ on Warm Love, one of his most forgettable hits). Domino is one of the guy's finest moments, but sadly the rest of the record doesn't measure up. It's still a relatively respectable record, but it doesn't compare to Astral Weeks or Moondance. If you can find it used, go for it. Just don't pay full price.
B00005JN0T|2.0|The writers used the character names, and the book name, but nothing else <br />The explanation of the 3 laws was ridiculous <br />The art work of the robots was good <br />Will Smith did his usual fantastic job as an actor, but the writers gave him poor material and where comedy was called for it went over like a lead balloon. <br />I Robot is part of a series of Asimov books resolving around both human and robot characters.  The human and the robot both evolve and explore the meaning of life and humanity.  None of this appeared in the movie.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|A supernatural drama with human heart. If your a comic book freak with absolutely no life, than yeah you probably won't like this movie, due to its departure from the traditional Pheonix saga. But if you love the X-Men, and you love cool, realistic special effects, then this is the saturday night movie for you.
B000026FOA|5.0|I was lucky enough to hear to original LP when I was younger as my father was a huge fan of the ever thoughtful and often melancholy genius of Drake. There's nothing I can add that hasn't already been said with one exception. The re-master of this album is showing its colors in that there is a noticeable gain hiss from the original session tapes. This may have been a problem to deal with in the late 90's when this was re-mastered and re-issued. But with todays \\"de-hiss\\" technology, it effectively eliminates this slight noise that blankets the entire album. They really should reconsider re-re-mastering this album, again, from the original tapes, and not from this master to make this a completely perfect album in both execution and final CD (or DVD Audio) pressed result.
B000A6T262|5.0|What a great box set, all 10 of the Star Trek movies in either Directors Editions or Special Editions.  This is the most up to date set of these movies! There is nothing better as of today. This is the set to get! Aad at the sale price of $80, that's only $8 a movie, a muc better buy than individual purchases!
0385486804|3.0|I recently read Under the Banner of Heaven and loved Krakauer's writing, so I picked up Into the Wild.  Krakauer didn't disappoint.  His writing was honest, personal and to the point.  He doesn't mince words, and while his bias is obvious, he presents evidence that reveals many sides of Chris McCandless. <br /> <br />At the beginning of each chapter, there are quotes from well-known naturalists or passages highlighted by McCandless (a nice touch).  If you pick this up in a bookstore, read a couple of those - if they strike you as poignant and inspiring, read this book.  I just couldn't connect with McCandless, I didn't really agree with most of his philosophy or many of his choices. <br /> <br />This quote from the book is at the heart of my disconnect from the book, \\"By design McCandless came into the country with insufficient provisions, and he lacked certain pieces of equipment deemed essential by many Alaskans: a large-caliber rifle, map and compass, an ax.\\"  To me, that just seems disrespectful of nature and just plain stupid, something I would never find inspirational or admire.  BUT, I can see why some would, which is why I would recommend reading this book to those who are sympathetic to McCandless' beliefs and philosophies.  I just couldn't connect at all.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|You should buy this album just for the track Breathless. I can't get this song out of my head and everytime I hear it it makes me a little bit happier.
B000002J0P|5.0|I just got a new CD after having lost my old one a couple of years ago and listening to it again with a glass of wine with the years first autumn fire brought back so many incredible memories. A true masterpiece of lyrical and musical geniuses coming together to produce a sound unlike any other. If you don't have this complete album (CD) in your collection, quite simply it is incomplete.
B0002I10RW|1.0|Micheal Moore made me vomit while watching this movie. America would be a better place if he left here, which he should because he obviously doesn't appreciate everything that his country does for him. His extremely one sided argument has no historical value, and it a piece of brainwashing propaganda that he made in attempt to try to convince more people to hate that country that gives them so much.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|Though their popularity was somewhat overshadowed by the solo success of lead singer Rod Stewart, The Faces were truly a great band. There were all about making great music and having a good time, and that shows on this 19 track best-of.<br /><br />\\"Good Boys When They're Asleep\\" showcases everything The Faces were all about. Here's where you'll find classics like \\"Had Me A Real Good Time\\", \\"Cindy Incidentally\\", \\"Ooh La La\\" and their signature tune \\"Stay With Me\\" as well as a slew of other, lesser known gems.<br /><br />As the people at Rhino are known for doing, the songs have beren remastered to the highest degree, and the liner notes are fantastic. Snatch this up as soon as possible. It's worth it.
B000I2IT44|4.0|Simply put, this is an excellent production by an excellent band. I agree with most of the positive comments in the other reviews. This is a band that clearly knows TASTE. As I have already said in my title, this is a near perfect DVD with rich, clear sound quality. I deduct a star for a few minor quibbles:  <br /> <br />I applaud the \\"film look\\" of the picture but I do find the video color effects bothersome. I own a few concert DVD's that abuse this technique to a far greater degree though...(sorry, I won't mention any names...Yes...'ahem'...ELP...'cough,cough'). Just show me the regular band with the regular light show exactly as the band performs it live. I really do believe that the majority of fans who buy these concert recordings would appreciate it most this way.  <br /> <br />One more: I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the layer shift (picture freezing for a half second) during \\"So Called Friend\\". Now I'm no expert on DVD production and maybe there was no other way it could be done, but this one is pretty noticeable. I'm not sure if a higher end DVD player could mask this flaw so maybe that's why others haven't mentioned it. One of the Dream Theater DVD's has the layer change at the end of the song when the crowd cheers (now that's the way it should be done!!!) And the Rush DVD (R30) has one in the middle of a song also.  <br /> <br />An otherwise incredible performance and one that I'm sure will be visiting my DVD player for years to come...
B000H7JD4K|4.0|Iron Maiden has been my fave band ever...I adore any single note from \\"Iron Maiden\\" to \\"Seventh Son\\". They're the basis of Heavy Metal no-one can afford to miss! I cried in endless pain when Adrian Smith, and Dickinson later, left the band...and I cried even more when Blaze recorded that awful stuff I do not want to name! The 3 studio albums the band recorded after Maiden classic line-up reunion are really something! I regret they do not play in the classic \\"heavy style\\" anymore...they have taken the path of atmosphere and great epical songs. And they do it really well! The more you listen to \\" A Matter Of Life...\\" the more you'll like it! I must agree with other costumers' reviews...the sound is a little poor, the whole production is definetely something you won't remember! No weak tune...\\"Different World\\", \\"The Pilgrim\\", \\"The Longest Day\\", \\"The Reincarnation...\\" adn \\"The Legacy\\" are destined to become classics! Ah...just a note: too many intros here and there. I would have preferred a shorter lenght of the album focusing more on the best riffs they composed...simply do not stand albums that are more than 45 min. long...<br /><br />Enjoy it!
B000EULJLU|5.0|tool is weird because it takes all the sounds I was alredy hearing in my head and is able to make it into a song. when I am coming down,(thanx hofman) that whole whine changing pitch is alredy in my head before I even herd this song. so Its getting a chance to reveb in my head. You dont just listine to it. there is an interaction there. it also amazes me how they get that sound. you can challange every band to make new material and you still wont be able to get that sound and it just wont happen. I also like when they try to put tool in a genre. tool should be its own classifacation until further justifacation on this revelation and plausible hesitation w/o retaliation or condemnation............tion
0872863107|2.0|'Howl', like most -- perhaps all -- Beat poetry, has not aged well. It's a lazy, ugly poem which could have been written by any well-read and angry college kid. I have read it many times and see nothing in it of any value other than the historical.
0345410025|5.0|Any time Harry Lorayne and/or Jerry Lucas write something about memory, I listen.<br /><br />As far as memory techniques, this is the most information rich of all of the memory books.  Visualizing objects, substituting mental pictures for ideas and substituting consonant sounds for letters (which can be remembered using the techniques they give earlier in the book) all come together to make memorizing an easier job.<br /><br />I have memorized a lot of PIN numbers this way as well as my driver's license number, etc. I plan to memorize a whole lot more.<br /><br />I'd like to point out that using the techniques in this book do require concentration and effort.  In other words, it is still work.  You still have to study and take time -- the information is not just going to fall into your lap.  You still have to review. You will also need to tailor the techniques to fit your own mindset and thinking patterns. And remember -- some things are harder to learn than others.<br /><br />But a faithful, consistent practice of these techniques can greatly help your performance on the job, your grades in school and a lot of other things.  This book is well worth the money spent for it!
B000GY729M|3.0|The Killers have turned in their sparkly suits and makeup for some facial scruff. What I did like about this album is that they were trying to progress, and not repeat the same old formula. Oh I fear for them. They remind me of the band Deep Purple in that way, by not repeating a formula, and being truthful to the artistic self. Oh, I fear for them. By progressing, you lose fans, fair-weather fans perhaps, but the numbers will drop. Even worse, \\"Sam's Town\\" was trying to make a genuine serious declaration here, but really didn't have a lot to say. It appears to be all style, but not a lot of soul. The album never takes off due to it's gloomy writing and hooks that aren't nearly as well-defined as their debut album \\"Hot Fuss.\\" A sophomore slump perhaps? I give them points for not trying to repeat themselves musically, they just needed to work a bit longer on it.
B000HCO840|3.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie when I took my son and his friends to see it the theater.  I hadn't seen the first two at the time but, since then, have watched all three movies several times and find many things to like about them all.   <br /> <br />If I was rating just the movie, it would get a solid four stars.  But rating the DVD requires taking into account all the special features they did NOT include, but are holding out for a later edition.  Does Fox not understand that it is insulting to the consumer to hear on the DVD Director's Commentary track about all the goodies that are going to be included on the DVD but are not?  And there is really nothing about the Stan Lee edition that makes it worth the extra cost. <br /> <br />Back to the movie -- one can take exception with a lot of the choices made but, overall, it's a good time.  Some things -- like the virtual absence of Cyclops, Rogue and Nightcrawler -- were apparently due to the fact that the actors were involved in other projects and only available for a short time.  Unlike other reviewers, I didn't miss Nightcrawler at all, since he got very tedious very quickly in X-2.  Other choices were the obvious result of the fact that Brett Ratner has the artistic sensibilities of a 13-year-old.  Some of the dialog is just atrocious.  (Wolverine's pep talk to the X-Men as they head into battle is enough to make once feel embarrassed for Hugh Jackman.  Despite his incredible talent, even he can't bring it off without sounding ridiculous.)  Halle Berry is (as others have said here) as wooden as she was in the first two movies.  Famke Janssen has two really terrific scenes, but spends most of the movie walking around as if she's catatonic.  Once Ratner and company set up the story of her immense powers, they were clearly stuck with the dilemma that, if she used her powers, it would obviate the need for the battle scenes with all the other mutants, which takes up a good third of the movie.  But they didn't bother coming up with any compelling reason why she is just standing on the sidelines for most of the film like a goth Barbie doll.  They could have expressed her inaction as the result of Jean Grey fighting to keep Phoenix in check, with Phoenix finally bursting free when under direct attack, but that would have taken the focus off Ratner's beloved CG effects.   <br /> <br />Despite these flaws, the movie is not as good as X-Men or even X-2, but it is entertaining and somewhat emotionally satisfying, although not nearly as much as Ratner believes it to be (as he expresses on his commentary).  For all the special features that this disc SHOULD have come with, I guess fans will just have to wait for, and pay out for, the next release.  What a rip-off.   <br />
B000H30B2C|5.0|This movie defies all known laws of biology and human species but is still a great fun to watch. I don't think any Ape could ever fall in love with a human being and we all know that dinosaurs eat plants. Yet in this flick they struggle to get their hands on Naomi Watts and eat her. I think the original title for this film was to be King Kong vs T-Rex. The plot develops kind of slow in the beginning, but the second half of the film is just breathtaking till the last scene. Very interesting.
0553381687|5.0|I first bought A Game of Thrones for the sheer size of it. I am a voracious reader, and anything below 500 pages just isn't worth my time. But when I started reading it, I quickly realized that this was not just any other novel. This was the world of Westeros, a land once divided into seven kingdoms, but now ruled by one king. This is a land where dragons have become mere legends, where the dead walk the  night and slit human throats while the king and his court remains ignorant.<br /><br />What struck me most about this book is that it didn't seem to have an apparent goal. There was no quest to be accomplished, no \\"Dark Lord\\" that needed to be destroyed. More like, it was an intricate plot of characters, trying to find their place in the world, filled with mystery, romance, sex, betrayal, battle, bloodshed, and tears. A marvelous novel! One of the best I have ever read.<br /><br />Now, in all fairness, some of you might not enjoy this as much as I did. If you're a big fan of typical, cliched fantasy, where the common village boy turns out to be the \\"chosen one\\" and sets out to destroy the dark lord with a band of faithful firends, then this might not be the book for you. If you might not like swearwords, sex, or grisly details, then this definitely is not the book for you. Furthermore, if you don't like too much detail in your novel, then I wouldn't really buy this book (the first 50 pages or so are especially tiresome). Plus, if you don't like all of your favorite characters to die, then this book will make you cry.<br /><br />Now let's get into the details of this book, shall we?<br /><br />This book is around 800 pages long, part of a long series called A Song of Ice and Fire. It is composed of many chapters with the names of different characters as the titles, each chapter devoted to describing the points of views of each individual character. This might help you understand what motivates the bad guys to do what they do, and makes you get personal with  all the other characters and helps you understand their deep emotions and feelings. The characters in the book are spaced out in different parts of the world, so there will be alot of moving around from place to place with each chapter. Medieval culture is heavily relied upon in this story: it has lords and ladies, chivalrous knights (and unchivalrous ones), kings and queens, and bastards and murderers. Magic is seldom mentioned, and the use of swords is much more prominent. You won't find anything taken from the wolrd of Tolkien like very other fantasy novel (in other words, it's original!).<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a great book with the most intruiging plot I've ever read (not including the first few chapters). A book that refuses to stay shut. 5 stars just doesn't do it justice.nd helps you understand their deep emotions and feelings.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 just blew my mind when I saw it. It gives a complete new perspective on the politics of the US and on Bush's administration. The film's objectivity is not to be questioned, cause Michael Moore gives clear evidence on everything. This movie really shows what America is like in this new era and how innocent people die for its welfare. I am amazed that this film was actually released for the open public and that the author wasn't hanged on the street. I wouldn't be surprised if that happened.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|Like one of the other reviewers, I am totally captivated by Dido's performance in this concert video...both her songs and how she interacts with the audience between songs. Also, like another reviewer, I am thrilled by the minimalist style of editing used here.  This is the way a concert should be filmed!  I don't want to feel motion sickness when I'm watching a video!  I don't want to be at the mercy of a video editor on steroids!  I want to be pulled into the music...pulled into the performance and the performer.  And that's what this video does.  Thank you, Dido and your team, for choosing to make this video so very watchable!  Lastly, I was not familiar with all the songs Dido sings...and I was very pleasantly surprised by how good all the ones that don't get regular air play on the radio are.  You won't regret buying this video.
B00004RD97|5.0|First let me say this album is not solely for fans of the doom genre, I enjoyed it long before I knew there was such a genre. It is simply an album for those that enjoy a good bit of heavy, low-end rock with an undeniable 70s styling. No pretence, no never ending guitar licks, just flat out heavy fun.<br /><br />To put this album in a little bit of context, Electric Wizard established themselves as a class doom/stoner act with their s/t debut which showed signs of later writing, and their monolithic tour de force of fuzzy riffs, \\"Come My Fanatics\\". \\"Dopethrone\\" sees the band continue the vast songwriting, huge juicy riffs and enough low-end to do some serious ear damage. Arguably their career highlight, this is sure to give you a thrill if you're into this sort of thing, and for those new to the genre, be prepared for a big, bludgeoning ride of juicy fun.<br /><br />\\"Dopethrone\\" also marks Jus Oborn's introduction to the distorted, `behind the mix' vocal effect, which I initially questioned, but have grown to love. The result puts far more emphasis on the riffs and also gives a new abrasive, almost gritty vibe that the previous albums lacked. The style is best highlighted in the brooding I, The Witchfinder, with Oborn's verse delivery truly eerie and desolate. Perhaps the highlight to the album is Funeralopolis, simply one of EW's best opening riffs, incorporated perfectly in a two-section structure that sees another absolutely killer riff rampage for the closing minutes. A real adrenaline rush, ended perfectly by an exhausted, panting, simple exhortation of `f*ck' from Jus. It works, it really does.<br /><br />Other standout tracks include the monumental Weird Tales, clocking in at over 15 minutes, the song glides through everything one could adore about EW - big riffs, tempo changes, psychedelic atmospherics and of alternative lyrics inspired by science fiction and, well, `weird tales'.<br /><br />\\"Dopethrone\\" is quite simply a landmark in the doom genre, it is what every band should aim for - sumptuous riffs, psychedelic moments, interesting song structures and a complete lack of pretence, something I admire in EW. This album is not solely for doom fans as I stated earlier, if you're a fan of a good heavy slab of rocking fun, it would be a mistake to overlook this.re, it is what every band should aim for - sumptuous riffs, psychedelic moments, interesting song structures and a complete lack of pretence, something I admire in EW.

B000EHSVQE|5.0|...I'm so sorry!  I loved it.  I have to admit, the first five to ten minutes had me thinking, \\"What the heck is going on?\\"  And it took me a while to catch the \\"feeling\\" of the movie.  It's not really like any other movie I've seen, really.  It kind of jumps from one thing to another without transitions, so I guess some film afficionados could fault it for its uneven, disjointed feel.  Or Pedro's odd, unexplained absences from school, or why he felt so hot when no one else did, and went home to cool off (like that would make a difference).  Why???  But I think it was its total departure from the typical film style that actually drew me in...more like life, a series of unconnected events that eventually lead to something interesting.<br /><br />True, a lot of its appeal is the fact that people can laugh at its characters' foibles, but if a person is truly honest, they'll have to admit that at some level they relate to him when he does dumb things.  Like hitting on a girl by saying the following line (sure to make you swoon!):<br /><br />\\"I see you're drinking 1%.  Is that 'cuz you think you're fat?...(long pause here)....'Cuz you're not.  You could totally drink whole if you wanted to.\\"<br /><br />Bring out the smelling salts, baby!  Think I'm gonna faint!  What a sauve character.<br /><br />There have been many, many \\"nerd\\" movies, and I don't think most of them \\"get it\\" when it comes to the real thing.  There's always some kind of magical transformation that says, \\"Gee, this person wasn't so nerdy after all\\" or some kind of vindication of their great intellect, or something.  At the end of this one, although he is applauded, let's face it, Napoleon is still about the nerdiest guy you'll ever meet.  And, um, sorry, but there's no great intellectual prowess to be had, either.  Even taming a wild honeymoon stallion isn't quite enough to get Napoleon out of nerd-dom, and no amount of \\"bling,\\" even by his beloved Lafawn\\"duh\\" (as he spells it!) is enough to enable Napoleon's brother Kip to actually be hip when he sings to her.<br /><br />Okay, so it's a weird movie, full of weird people.  But I have to say, I have met plenty of Uncle Ricos, Kips, Napoleons, and even people like his grandma.  And I lived in a house with 1970's shag carpet, dark wood paneling, and gold foil wallpaper with olive and orange flowers on it.  So yeah, I guess you could say that I was a nerd who didn't \\"get it,\\" just like Napoleon.<br /><br />It's not for everyone, but for what it's worth, I loved it.  There's no sex in it other than suggestiveness, and the worst language in it is an improvised, \\"I'd be p----- off, too,\\" in a quiet conversation.  The people who say they want the 90 minutes of their life back after this movie may not have seen \\"American Psycho.\\"  Now that'a a film which I believe actually warrants saying, it's REALLY not worth seeing!  You'll want your life back, and a brain scrubber afterward, never mind the brilliant cast and occasional humor.eon's brother Kip to actually be hip when he sings to her.<br /><br />Okay, so it's a weird movie, full of weird people.

B00065GX64|5.0|I have bought a few of the Criterion releases (none of which I had seen, but about which, I had read wonderful reviews.) I figured that Criterion wouldn't bother working so hard on preservation of films that weren't any good.  Unfortunately, 3 of the ones I had previously bought weren't so great.  They stay in their boxes untouched for a 2nd viewing.  Not that the DVD quality wasn't good, but the films themselves weren't that great.  I was already planning my \\"be careful with Criterion review\\" when this M started in my DVD player.<br /><br />I was completely premature in my judgement.  This film is outstanding. It is old, but completly revelvant and compelling.  This is the type of film that SHOULD be preserved forever, (exactly what I was expecting from all Criterion releases).  I am not a film expert or a film student, however I am certainly a fan of good writing, acting, cinematography, and directing.  This film has all those qualities and is one which anyone interested in great filmmaking should see.  I continue to try to broaden my DVD collection with quality films, but also ones that I actually want to watch and that say something.  Ones that seem to change you a little after watching.  Ones that stay with you. These seem to me to be the qualities of a great film. Peter Lorre rocks!!! I especially enjoyed the interview with Lang and the film school tapes on the bonus dvd.<br /><br />Thank you Criterion, for this one.  Please continue to release well- preserved landmark films for discovery of the general public (but don't junk up your reputation by throwing in crap.)
B000EHRVP6|1.0|I figured I'd try out this one. My friend liked it, big mistake, she's a horror fan and I'm not. I figured I could handle Tarrantino's Kill Bill, I could handle this. NOT!!! <br /> <br />I started sweating and getting sick. I didn't even finish it. Not only is it just porn, it's disgusting after that. I can't imagine how this is entertaining.  <br /> <br />This movie just reminds me of why I don't get into horror and gore flicks. I can take a scary movie, but this is just gross. I'm all for men getting what they deserve for being the randy pigs they can be, but this is just too much. Too much porn and too much gore. <br /> <br />I'll just skip this guy's films in the future.

0743243315|5.0|In her first novel Monica Ali does in brilliant job in placing her characters in their larger context. Typically novels of this genre are very demanding on readers who do not have much insight of the other culture. Monica Ali manages to interpret the complexities of Bangladeshi culture, especially Bangladeshi immigrant culture and make them fairly approachable to western readers.<br /><br />The author takes up the issue of women's position in Bangladesh and in the immigrant community in Britain without giving it obsessive importance. She shows very adeptly how the young Bangladeshi immigrants born in the UK are struggling with their identity and struggling between the lure of white affluent drug pushers and religious extremism. The visions of `home' creeps up constantly like a ubiquitous spook.<br /><br />The choice of the name of the novel and the characters is brilliant. She seems to suggest that all her characters, the kindly yet bloated and ineffectual Chanu, the perceptive yet uneducated Nazneen, Dr Azad with an English wife, the ruthless usurer Mrs Islam, the natural born leader and man of action Karim and Nazneen's sister Hasina back 'home' in Bangladesh are walking in their narrow lanes and facing brick walls on all sides. Hasina takes control of her fate, as does Nazneen in the end. Monica Ali exposes a lot of malaise in both societies yet Nazneen and Hasina, central to the two poles of the narrative never lose a sense of hope and wonderment. This is very poignant against the increasingly disillusioned resignation of Chanu.<br /><br />Highly recommended as this book is at once perceptive yet innocent and compassionate.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|Last Stand got mixed reviews from critics, so I was at first reluctant to see it.  Up-front, I must say I liked the first two movies, but I was hardly blown away. <br /> <br />However, I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining I found \\"Last stand\\" to be.  Yes, it was too short with too many characters (without sufficient screen time)...however, it was a fast-paced movie which wrapped up the storyline from the first two movies- and I actually prefer this movie's version of the \\"Dark Phoenix\\" plot to the X-Men comics. <br /> <br />Yes, the critics are right- it's not as \\"artistic\\" as the first two flicks, but I was entertained more and it had a good, poignant ending.  Ratner deserves credit for doing a good job.  In fact, after seeing the abysmal \\"Superman Returns\\" by Bryan Singer, I'm actually glad that Singer didn't helm X-Men 3. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
1401302378|5.0|Push v. Pull Consumerism.  In Chris Anderson's 'The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More', the author's clear thesis or point for Producers and Publishers alike is that due to the change in media outlets, and the ability for consumers to make choices of media content based upon availability, consumerism as a whole has dramatically changed from the time when a handful of individuals 'pushed' a small amount of product through the media channels and essentially forced audiences into a select choice of products.  Today, due to the Internet, due to a larger cable base, due to Print-on-Demand publishing, consumer reach and access to what might have been limited demand material is in fact, as a cost-basis whole, in demand and feasably accessable. The point is this: due to the ability for consumers to educate themselves in today's current enviornment, the consumer is more direct in what they want, and can and will seek it out as long as it is accessable.  This means that those in the business of entertainment . . . and all other goods for that matter . . . but particularly in entertainment, have the feasable marketability to launch product that can be accessed by consumers in what was once considered non-traditional ways.  As Anderson has pointed out through applaudable reseach that included the assistance of many of the major chains, the 'best seller' or 'top seller' once made up a major portion of product sales in a particular entertainment catagory; however, this has changed dramatically, whereas the catagory of 'best seller' or 'top seller' now makes up less than 9% of total sales in a particular catagory.  This means that programming and publishing selection as a whole must be re-evaluated.  Clearly, the 'little voice' is not as little as we thought.  If you are in the business of providing entertainment product, this is a very important read. Some material you may be familiar with and some you will not; however, there is enough here that Anderson presents in a way that is unique and educational.

B00005JO20|2.0|Well, I guess this is what happens when you have three big wins (Lord of the Rings) in your corner.  You are given a free pass from the studio to go wild. And Jackson did.  There are so many side-stories and silly stories in the new Kong that you have to pinch yourself and remember there was a great original one way back in 1933.  And that movie had the good sense to know it was a B movie, and that 90 minutes is what you should clock in at. But I guess Jackson won't do anything less than 3 hours these days, no matter how over stuffed the end product becomes. Still, there are some wonderful scenes in this movie. Jackson is a master with CGI (which is why I'm giving this 2 stars), and the monkey is incredible, as are the bugs and other monsters. (But even that talent will have you wondering if some of the shots are outtakes from the Rings movies. The famous Skull Island wall looks like some sort of nuked rejection from Mordor.)  <br /> <br />Excepting Black, the cast is fine.  But as in any movie, a cast is only as good as its script.  And Jackson's attempt to inject importance is laughable.  Having characters discussing Conrad's Heart of Darkness does not ratchet things up a bit. It just looks pretentious. And I actually felt bad for Watts (a fine actress) at the end, with her making lovey dove eyes at Kong as they skated across the ice. It was like Jackson went out for a smoke and Ron Howard stepped in to film that incredibly bad and syrupy scene. In fact, the  whole relationship between the monkey and Watts was so overplayed (in the original Fay Wray never stopped screaming, she never chased after Kong, as Watts does, in any way) that it undercut the movie's final line: It was beauty that killed the beast.  No, it was the director.
B000F8O35U|5.0|THE LITTLE MERMAID signalled a new renaissance for the Disney animation department.  Following the lean years of \\"The Black Cauldron\\" and \\"The Great Mouse Detective\\", the animation department was within a heartbeat of ringing it's death-knell, when in 1989  a little mermaid swam into cinemas and into the hearts of a generation of moviegoers.<br /><br />Based on the bittersweet Hans Christian Andersen fairytale, the story of  mermaid Ariel (voiced by Jodi Benson) and her quest to become a human and marry Prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes) marked the return of the classic Disney fairytale musical.  It had been over 30 years since \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", and audiences completely ate it up.  I can happily say that I was there when Ariel first burst onto movie screens during the original theatrical release (so this film, along with \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"Aladdin\\", holds a very special place in my childhood).<br /><br />With a score by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken (\\"Little Shop of Horrors\\"), the musical numbers of THE LITTLE MERMAID include the Oscar-winning \\"Under the Sea\\", \\"Part of Your World\\", \\"Kiss the Girl\\" and \\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\\".<br /><br />THE LITTLE MERMAID had previously been available as a limited-edition DVD way back when the DVD format was still in it's infancy (so a lot of people never got around to buying it).  This brand-new double disc Platinum Edition is a must-own purchase for all fans of the film, with a wide array of bonus features:<br /><br />* Disney Fastplay (allowing the movie and select bonus features to play automatically without the need for a remote control - great for little kids!)<br />* Audio commentary w/ the filmmakers<br />* Brand new 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theatre sound mix<br />* \\"Kiss the Girl\\" music video with Ashley Tisdale (\\"High School Musical\\")<br />* DisneyPedia segments<br />* \\"Treasures Untold\\" Making-Of documentary<br />* \\"The Little Match Girl\\" (brand new animated featurette, based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale with a music score adapted from Borodin themes; originally intended for \\"Fantasia 2000\\")<br />* \\"The Story Behind the Story\\" (compares the original Andersen fairytale with the Disney film, and the proposed 1940 animated Disney film w/ storyboard drawings by Kay Neilsen)<br />* \\"Storm Warning\\" (a look at the special animated effects team)<br />* Deleted scenes, storyboard-to-film comparisons<br />* \\"Under the Sea Adventure\\" (a virtual ride, recreating an attraction that was originally intended for Disneyland)<br />* \\"The Little Mermaid III\\" (sneak-peek at the upcoming straight-to-video sequel)s; originally intended for \\"Fantasia 2000\\")  * \\"The Story Behind the Story\\" (compares the original Andersen fairytale with the Disney film, and the proposed 1940 animated Disney film w/ storyboard drawings by Kay Neilsen)  * \\"Storm Warning\\" (a look at the special animated effects team)  * Deleted scenes, storyboard-to-film comparisons  * \\"Under the Sea Adventure\\" (a virtual ride, recreating an attraction that was originally intended for Disneyland)  * \\"The Little Mermaid III\\" (sneak-peek at the upcoming straight-to-video sequel)

006072448X|3.0|the writing is beautiful and clean, and the concept stunning. unfortunately if this book purports to address the question \\"why do tennage killers kill?\\" it avoids the answer entirely. by making kevin essentially evil and unredeemable from birth, there is no nature/nurture debate, no real qu as to whether loving parents and a strong home environment could stop any child becoming a killer. Kevin might have had a mother who failed to love him (a fact which seemed to emanate from the unloveability of kevin rather than a flaw in eva - she adores their second child, who is such a simplistic character so clearly designed to act as a counterbalance and foil to the dark nature of kevin) he has a father who adores him, and a comfortable home life with parents who had a good marriage in the beginning. <br /> <br />as I say, I think \\"simplistic\\"  is the best description of this book. from the birth of celia the trajectory is apparent. and the endless parade of incidents from Kevin's birth, while beautifully drawn, does make for dismal reading. <br /> <br />no pregnant woman or mother of a child probably under about 2 should read this book!

0743243315|4.0|Nanzeen's development from a sickly infant who barely survives her first few days to a self-actualizing adult is the focus of this novel. Married off at a young age to a much older man and carted off to live in London, Nanzeen is initiated into the joys and sorrows of motherhood while still a child herself. Her husband struggles to control his household and make a living in a society that seems to place no value on his education. As feckless as he is, he is a surprisingly sympathetic character, more bewildered than offended by his wife's growing independence. Also well-drawn characters, their two daughters are vividly flesh and blood as they try to make their way in a western culture with immigrant parents they love, but can't really fathom. <br /> <br />Nanzeen's development doesn't come in flashes of objective insight, but through trial and error, through having to deal with everyday situations. Ultimately, she assumes responsibility for her family's life, reconciling her family's teachings for women to be passive and accepting of their fates with the necessity of taking action for her family's sake. She grapples with the contradictory lesson her mother taught: if you take action, you are messing with your fate. She decides, almost by default, that she has nothing to lose by steering her own ship. <br /> <br />The novel sheds light on ethnic tensions in London and immigrant experience. The reaction of the Islamics, trying to lead normal lives in a foreign country, to the shock of 911 is particularly poignant. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.

Concieved in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's orginal comic book owes its<br /><br />power and pleasures to Christopher Nolan, a director who takes his material seriously, and to Christian Bale, a star who shoulders that seriousness with ease. What Nolan understands better than any other previous director that without Bruce Wayne, Batman is just a rich wacko with illusions of grandeur and a terrific pair of support hose. Without his suave alter ego, this weird bat man is a superhero without humanity, an avenger without a conscience, an id without a superego. Which is why, working from his and David S. Goyer's very fine screenplay, Nolan more or less begins at the beginning, taking Batman back to his original trauma and death of his parents. It's amazing what an excellent cast, a solid screenplay, and a regard for the source material can do for a comic book movie.the source material can do for a comic book movie.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Out of 5 stars, I give it a 10. If you haven't seen it, you're missing the past two decades. <br />The information is right on the Money, in more ways than one.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|Batman drops 60 pounds to play an insomniac in a small, independent movie. Why did Bale do this exactly, was he so overpowered by the screenplay that he said, \\" I must dedicate myself to this role as a method actor with no reservation whatsoever! \\", is that it? Should we blame Robert De Niro and his Oscar winning turn in \\" Raging Bull \\", for such nonsensical acting decisions? De Niro gained like 60 pounds and turned into fat boy Jake LaMotta, so now the new generation of young actors aspire to De Niro's over the top antics? Good for Bale that he got back to his healthy weight very quickly, but the question I ask is, I'm aware of suffering for your art but is the art worth suffering for?    The short answer as regards The Machinist, is no. This is not a great film, it might be a good film, maybe even an effective tale of what guilt and conscience can do to a human being, but it's not a masterpiece in any sense. This isn't Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment for god's sake! Did Bale just assume that this film was worth the experience he put himself through by reading the screenplay or did Bale just want to shock people and get easy publicity? I don't care what his intentions were, I care about the finished work. The Machinist is a fairly standard psychological study and who couldn't see the ending coming from a mile away? How many recent movies have we had with protoganists fighting against the forces of their imaginations? Seems like a whole bunch.    I recommend this movie for the overall fine performances and the well-crafted direction, it has some good scenes no doubt about it. I do wonder if Christian Bale or another young actor wanting to make an impression will ever go the whole dedication route and become a full-blown alcoholic, heroin junkie or metamphetamine addict just for some drug culture movie they might be doing?! Talk about method acting!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I am convinced beyond any question. Always have believed it now it is written in stone. If you don't see this movie by choice, then you are a fool, a damned fool. You may learn more in 90 minutes than you have learned for the past ten years. For those who say they didn't like the movie, I don't believe they ever saw it.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|It is with mixed feelings that I review 'Stadium Arcadium'. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are 2.5 decades old and are extreme legends of alternative rock - their style of alternative rock that is. They are the kings of funk, mixing rock with punk as they only can. This album came very much anticipated by all RHCP fans and faced a mixed critical critique by the critics and fans alike. Firstly before I dwelve into the two in one album let me state for the record that the Artwork of this album is the best original idea the band could come up with. I loved the cover and the inside of the package. The back cover could have had a better band photo. But A+ for thought into the cover, very expressive and artistic.  <br /> <br />The RHCP's decided to release 2 albums at once as one, calling both CD's, Jupiter and Mars respectively. I thorougly enjoyed 'Jupiter' and was disappointed with 'Mars'. The new hit songs for this band came out of Jupiter with 'Dani California', 'She's Only 18' and 'Snow'. All three songs are exceptional and vintage Red Hot Chili Peppers sound. Two other songs in this album worth mentioning are 1. the self titled 'Stadium Arcadium' and 2. Hump de Bump that returns the listener to early RHCP's, the psychodelic funk was in overdrive.  <br /> <br />'Mars' for me had only 2 worthwhile songs and they were 'Desecration Smile' and '21st Century'. The rest of the songs on that album sounded like mere B-Sides and fillers. Quite possibly the album was a few songs too over the top.  <br /> <br />But there is enough here to keep all Red Hot Chili fans happy and enjoy the music, this may infact be their last fully fledged album. Not a bad effort at all.

B000HCO83Q|3.0|The main storyline focuses on Dr. Jean Gray, and her transformation into the Dark Phoenix which is quite interesting. Kelsey Grammer also appears as Dr. Hank McCoy, the Beast! I always loved this character from the vintage years of X-Men and Grammer is perfect casting. Beast and the Dark Phoenix make this one worth your time, but don't expect too much -- The Final Stand is just not quite as dramatically satisfying as the first 2 films in the series. This one is a fairly conventional allegory about tolerance with some excellent sci-fi elements and good performances from Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Halley Berry as Storm.
B000GFRJ58|4.0|...and it's the same one I had with my DualDisc copy of the Talking Heads' Remain in Light.  For some reason, I cannot get the audio on the tracks on the DVD side to be heard on my Pioneer DV-563A.  (I had this problem with 2 copies of Remain in Light, so now I'm wondering if it's just certain labels doing something odd with the DualDiscs, because my other DualDiscs play without issues on my Pioneer.)  However, the CD side plays just fine.  Strange.<br /><br />That said, this is a fine album.  Remembering that Ronnie Lane agreed to do this album when Pete Townshend turned him down for a loan, it's amazing the kind of art that desperate situations can produce.  \\"My Baby Gives it Away\\" could have easily fit onto any Who album, yet I'm glad Townshend kept it for himself--Daltrey's bluff and bluster, of which there was entirely too much on the Who's late '70s releases, would have just ruined it.  Ronnie Lane's contributions are absolute magic here, showing why he was so integral to the (Small) Faces.  And this was just about the time he was starting to be affected by the MS that would eventually end his life at the too-young age of 51.  I agree with another reviewer that the interview section is too short and needs more of Townshend's input, but it certainly is nice to have.
B0000A118M|2.0|I bought this CD.  I listened to this CD.  And then I listened again, and again...ad nauseum.  I get jazz.  I love jazz.  I \\"get\\" spiritual jazz.  This music is a load of crap.  It is boring, goes nowhere, and I fail to see why, when so much brilliantly done spiritual oriented jazz has been created, one would rather kneel at the alter of such mediocrity.  That Coltrane may have advanced the modal boundaries of jazz/sax does not a great (or even good, evidently) album make.  Trance-inducing offerings by Szabo, Tjader, Byrd, Hubbard, Hancock, Hutcherson, Horn and many others actually DO achieve the accolades unrightfully heaped upon this monotonous drone of a squak, so forego the lip service paid this and pursue those players for genuinely moving soul food if you, too, are able to listen to the MUSIC with your ears, instead of the hype.
B000E6ESL2|3.0|A shrink tries to help a young man threatening to commit suicide on his 21st birthday but it turns out that the doctor might be crazier than the patient he is trying to help when everyone he claims to talk to starts being identified as dead for years.

B00005JPAD|3.0|The annoying thing about this flick was the over and over and over again F word -- everybody overuses it in this picture. <br />Other than that the film is brutal and bloody. The action without the F word is excellent as usual as DiCaprio and Damon as well as Nicholson of course are doing an excellent job, and so does Wahlberg, Baldwin and the rest of the cast -- they are all good. <br />It's a like a modern-day Gangs of New York in a sense. The photography is also great and very graphic, and the soundtrack fits the mood. And the script, except for the F word (half of the dialogue) is also good. <br />Needless to say it's a guy movie and most chicks will be bored to death. Do I recommend this movie? Because of the misuse and overuse of the F word absolutely NOT. You'll live with just seeing the trailer. <br />I don't know why top directors like Scorsese have to resort to this kind of production when they could do just so much better without the use of the F word -- it's weird. <br />The story is about a rat inside the Boston PD and/or MA State Police, and a rat inside a mobster's inner circle. One is hunting the other and apparently nobody can be trusted.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|\\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is the most entertaining yet disturbing way to look at the dangers of climate change. It's about the rapid destruction of our planet due to new technologies. It's about human impact on our earth. It's about the future of our children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and ourselves.    For those people who ever doubted the harmful effects of global warming, they should watch the trailer, first. The trailer states, \\"If you ever looked at the ten hottest years ever measured, they've all occurred in the last 14 years. And the hottest of all...was 2005.\\" To some, a film about global warming is something that somebody would flip on The Discovery Channel. For others, including myself, a film about global warming is a gift from God. We as wealthy Americans have a niche on this world to do something about global warming. Because the majority of us don't spend time searching for water, for food, or for shelter, we have the responsibility to make a positive impact on the future of planet earth.    I don't care how old you are, where you live, what race you are, what social class you are, or how much you care about politics and the environment. All you need to do is watch \\"An Inconvenient Truth.\\"

B000002MQ9|4.0|The arrangement of selections on this CD are somewhat different from other Dead Can Dance arrangements in that the voice of Brendan Perry dominates the first selections while the voice of Lisa Gerrard dominates the last selections.  <br /> <br />The mixture of Celtic, African, Middle Eastern, and other musical traditions always makes Dead Can Dance a great bet for a good CD. On this CDC Anywhere Out of the World, Windfall, In the Wake of Adversity, and Xavier are my favorites. Windfall is an instrumental piece. Xavier combines the voices of Perry and Gerrard.  <br /> <br />Brendan Perry's voice has somewhat of the tone or sound of Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, or Frank Sanatra yet the presentation is more mysterious, existential, and brooding. He brings somewhat a tone of anxiety into his smooth presentation. I am sure Perry could probably do a great version of \\"I left my heart in San Francisco' with his dark, smooth, masculine voice but in Dead Can Dance the emphasis is mythical not current as well as transpersonal rather than personal.

B000G759LW|5.0|Hanging onto each beat, and the soulful/R&B/jazzy sound of Christina's voice, left me extremely satisfied with the purchase of her newest cd.  Christina once again proves she has the vocals and creativity that are unique and refreshing compared to many of the other artists these days.      The cd is for all ages, but I would probably guess the audience would tend more to late 20's to the elderly, and maybe not so much the younger generation besides those who are a bit more sophisticated and have a love and ear for good music.  However, I'm only guessing.      It's a very mature and sophisticated album, and beautifully written/produced and the vocals are absolutely Christina, beautiful.  I love all the songs, but \\"Hurt\\" is really touching.  The cd has also been packaged elegantly.  The price is a bit steep compared to others, but definitely worth it.   5+ stars
B000002OAZ|4.0|If you like Classic Rock and Roll and are looking to get into The Blues this is a great place to start.  Chess Records, in following the success of Fathers and Sons, ships both Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters to play with a who's who of British Rock.  On this album, Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Charlie Watts, and more accompany Howlin for a set of his classic tunes.  While this may not be Howlin Wolf's best material it is still fun.  The take out of Little Red Rooster is great where Eric and others try to talk Howlin into play along.  Steve Winwood really shines on this album.  Howlin while not at his peak is still a force of the blues. This is a great place to start and a great way to get someone into the blues.  Won't spare the expense of the delux version.
0393327655|4.0|Harris is doing what so many are trying to do.  He has reached a point in his life when the religion of spirituality doesn't make sense, yet his spiritual religion does.  Religion is an institutionalized remedy used to control the masses, usually through fear, and that institution has nothing to do with faith.  Religion and terror are key words, but Harris misses the most important part of being human, that we have a choice to be religious and therefore subjected to the terror of this institution, or to recognize our spirit as part of the the true \\"religion\\", non-denominational, non-secular, and therefore truly faithful. We need this book because it forces the questions and definition of religion versus spirituality.  Pair this with \\"God Winks\\"  and \\"Forget The Cures, Find The Cause,\\" and we may actually get a spiritual education.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Evanescences' first album \\"Fallen\\" had gradually made its way into multi-platinum stardom from the major success of their two songs \\"Bring me to Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\".  The two songs were featured in the movie \\"Daredevil\\" and sadly, the movie wasn't all that great.  But fortunatly, the songs were played on the radio and obviously caught most listeners and intrigued them to pursue the whole experience by purchasing their album. <br /> <br />We've all had our fill of something unique and amazing.  But then there was a long....LONG wait before their next album even was mentioned.  But in all honesty I'm glad; the product was definatly worth the wait. <br /> <br />When the album was released, I certainly had my hopes reserved though; I knew the band had been through some major changes.  Amy Lee and Ben Moody were the major parts of the band, both contributing very raw and emotional talent to their debut album.  After Moody had left the band Mid-Tour, I thought I'd never seen another album, or at the very least a decent one.  So now enter \\"The Open Door\\", Evanescences follow up album almost after 4 years of their debut album.  \\"The Open Door\\" is a album full of haunting and memorable songs; from the very opening to the very last song, you'll feel the pain, frustration, and hardships that the band has been through. <br /> <br />It is an album that perfectly compliments their debut album.  Their lyrics are much more personal and that always makes for good song writing.  Amy Lee's vocals are still amazing and the band's overall tone has somewhat matured since \\"Fallen\\".  But either way you put it, this album rocks.  Not everyone will like it, but if you liked the first one, then I've no doubt you'll like this one too.
B000002GBD|5.0|Nazareth really blew the roof off with this one. This album was an absolute masterpiece. This is much better then just the two tracks that everyone knows in Love Hurts and Hair Of The Dog. They were an amazing hard rock band and this album gives you everything you could want plus more.  <br />Hair of the Dog- Outstanding song with great guitar and lyrics.     <br /> <br />Miss Misery- My favorite song on this album just rocks the house down.   <br /> <br />Love Hurts- In my opinion the weakest song but all bands had to have a power ballad so I don't discount this song at all because it is a good one just not a rocker.     <br /> <br />Changin' Times- Another great rocker. Fits in perfect with the rest of the album.   <br /> <br />Beggars Day- Nazareth keeps rocking and this one keeps the trend. Awesome song that gets no play.     <br /> <br />Rose in the Heather- This is an instrmantal that shows another slower side to the band. Great sounds from this one. Slower then the others but is awesome.   <br /> <br />Whiskey Drinkin' Woman- WOW!! This one really hits the spot as a classic. Everything about this song is amazing.   <br /> <br />Please Don't Judas Me- This song brings a very intimate message. Perfect way to end this album. <br /> <br />All in all this is one of the best rock albums of the 70's and a must have for anyone who likes classic rock.  <br />
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins makes a number of excellent points in this thought-provoking book.<br /><br />First of all, he tells us that polls show that less than half of American voters would be willing to vote for an atheist!  Such a candidate would, um, not have a prayer.  Of course, I disagree with these polls somewhat, given that as a Polytheist, I include the Jews, Christians, and Muslims among the atheists.<br /><br />Next, Dawkins asks us to be careful not to show automatic respect for all religious statements.  Suppose we're told that racism, apartheid, hate speech, and other counterproductive ideas are religiously justified.  Should we then refuse to speak out against them?  I certainly hope not.  And the author promises that he will not be intentionally or unnecessarily offensive, but he will not treat religious claims with undue respect or with kid gloves.<br /><br />After that, Dawkins does mention that some of the material about the monotheist god does look very unreasonable, but that we have to be careful not to dismiss monotheism on the basis of some of its most ridiculous adherents.  And to his credit, he admits that it is not at all clear why monotheism ought to be considered superior to (or more advanced than) polytheism.  Good for him!<br /><br />I've never been too happy with the idea having others tell folks what their religious beliefs ought to be.  And I certainly sympathize with Dawkins when he complains about the \\"airy nonchalance with which these people [the Catholic mythologians] make up the details as they go along.  It is just shamelessly invented.\\"<br /><br />The author does discuss some arguments about the existence of a monotheistic god.  And he comes up with another good point here.  Namely, some people say that human beings are so complex that they could not have evolved.  And from there, they say that logically, there must have been an intelligent designer.  But the logical conclusion is the opposite.  Perhaps humans could have evolved.  Perhaps even Goddesses and Gods could have evolved.  But once we say that even humans are too complex to have evolved, we've surely ruled out the far more complex monotheistic god.<br /><br />Dawkins does discuss the possibility that fundamentalist religions may subvert science, and I have to agree that we all need to take such a threat seriously.  And he further shows that we do not need religiously derived rules to make decisions on moral issues.<br /><br />Near the end of the book, the author tells us about an interesting incident, namely the kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara.  Mortara was kidnapped by and then raised by the Pope himself.  And Dawkins makes the excellent point that many Catholic officials \\"seem genuinely not to have understood what a terrible thing they were doing to poor Edgardo Mortara.\\"  That's something I had not thought about before: I simply assumed that they felt that as powerful people, they could do what they pleased.<br /><br />On the other hand, Dawkins hints at making two other far less impressive points about this kidnapping.  One is that Mortara's parents could have gotten him back by converting.  Whether this is true or not, it's irrelevant given that the whole point of the book is that one ought not transfer one's support to wicked religious authorities.  Surely, there are good secular reasons to avoid betraying one's community in order to join forces with such counterproductive people.  The other point is that Jews could have been more careful about interacting with non-Jews, thus reducing the chance of such a kidnapping!  But that's absurd: he must be one of the few non-Jews to complain that Jews made a mistake by not insulating themselves more from the non-Jewish community.  Still, these are not major points by Dawkins, and I won't deduct any stars from my rating of the book for this.<br /><br />Edgardo Mortara's parents were, of course, Jewish.  And that gets many of us to call him a \\"Jewish child\\" as opposed to \\"a child of Jewish parents.\\"  Similarly, many of us have a tendency to call children \\"Catholic\\" or \\"Muslim\\" or \\"Protestant\\" when in fact it is their parents who are Catholics, Muslims, or Protestants (On the other hand, I have noticed that when I was very young, I generally was not called a \\"Pagan child\\").  Dawkins quite properly objects, saying that we need to confirm each person's right to make their own decisions about religion, and that they need not be restricted to the religions of their parents.<br /><br />I recommend this book.lic\\" or \\"Muslim\\" or \\"Protestant\\" when in fact it is their parents who are Catholics, Muslims, or Protestants (On the other hand, I have noticed that when I was very young, I generally was not called a \\"Pagan child\\").

B000HCO840|2.0|I can't believe the ego that it must have taken to manipulate the XM universe this way. I can't believe they killed Xavier, Scott (Cyclops), and Jean, nullified the powers of Rogue, Magneto, and Mystique, (none of whom would choose that in the XM universe I know and love), and to not include a character (and a budding romance) for Gambit (with Rogue, of course).  Bobby can have Kitty - that was one of the rare scenes I liked.  I also liked the Kitty/Juggernaut scene near the end, and it's scenes like that that made me give it even a 2.  Lastly, what the heck was wrong with Hugh's hair through most of this movie?  It looked terrible - nothing like how good it looked in the previous two movies.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This movie is ok. I forgot when I bought it how dark, depressing, and sad this movie was. The movies affects were really cool and a neat glipse of the future, but for me, it was a bit dark and seems to constantly just keep sliding down adn down into a sadder state during the film. It is a story about a kid robot (the first robot that is able to Love) who is later discarded by his parents. So starts his journey to find a blue fairy (fairy tale) which he never finds, to become human. The ending is sort of cool, but the movie from starting out on a positive note, jst keeps sliding down and making you more depressed and upset over this robots plight. It is an ok rent, but I wouldn't buy it unloess you are inot sadder movies and or a Sci-Fi bone in you. Even with my interest I will rarely ever watch this one.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I don't understand all this talk about the Red Hots \\"putting down their guns\\", \\"hanging their mitts\\" .. and so on. It's like people are expecting a band to do the same thing for 23 years and produce the same type of music, ignoring the fact that bands and musicians like the rest of us, evolve, mature, change  .. etc, the point is few bands do it as gracefully and as fantastically as the Red Hots. Sure some songs sound a little bit more tame \\"Hard to Concentrate\\", others sound a little bit more Pop \\"Especially in Michigan\\", others more stadium or melodic .. but how many bands you know can deliver something like \\"Snow ((Hey Oh))\\". This songs bursts out right after the first single - \\"Dani California\\" - as if to challenge the current music scene to produce something that's even close in creativity and musicianship. Then how many bands you can think of can deliver a first grade first-nature funk like \\"Charlie\\", or \\"Hump De Bump\\", or \\"Storm in a Teacup\\". The Red Hots sure have moved in several new directions over the years, but they have managed to keep a large enough distance from anybody else doing the same type of thing, to remain  sounding original. This is a band that knows how to feel, chill, go crazy and party in their songs, and this is the type of album Stadium Arcadium is. Buy it, it's unique, double albums rarely come this natural and unbloated.
B000GIXEIG|3.0|Overall, this is a good film if you consider it as a stand-alone work concerning Dark Age Europe. Relative to the Beowulf poem/mythos, however, it takes grand creative license with the story. Essentially the story is there, but the filmmakers spend way too much time shoe-horning the fictional Selma into the story as a love interest for Beowulf. There is no such character in the original poem, and her inclusion in the film comes across as a typical Hollywood manuever (despite the fact that it's an Icelandic film) to appeal to female viewers (the few that might be watching). So much of the story is dedicated to forcing Selma into the story that the mythos as a whole suffers. Worst of all is the part where Grendel sneaks into her dwelling one night via flashback and \\"has his way\\" with her, the result of which is a half-troll/half-human child that's just perfect for the obligatory sequel-setup ending (yet another Hollywood tradition).  <br /> <br />Portraying Grendel as a troll and not some fanged demonic beast from Hell was a good choice on the part of the filmmakers, considering how recent scholarly research suggests that he may have originated in earlier troll legends from Scandinavia. But the inclusion of his troll father murdered by King Hrothgar (something else not mentioned in the poem) serves as the standard vengeance motivation, and Grendel's sea-hag mother is poorly portrayed and used to minimal effect, with minimal screen-time as well. In particular, the battle between Beowulf and Grendel's mother comes across as spur-of-the-moment and rather anti-climactic, which is worsened by the suggestion that Beowulf haphazardly grabs a sword from a nearby pile of gold and treasure instead of coming prepared with his own sword (the poem tells extensively of his sword, called Hrunting or Nagling, by varying accounts, and also of the giant's sword he took from the hoard and used against her after his own blade was broken).  <br /> <br />Let's not forget the fact that thedragon that Beowulf battles toward the end of the poem makes no appearance in the film at all. Nor do we see Beowulf's death, burial or any of the remaining incidents that tell the entire story.  <br /> <br />Cinematically speaking, the film makes excellent use of the Icelandic landscape, which is truly beautiful, but there are no forests as described in the poem (Iceland lacks such wooded regions). Production is top-notch, and the costumes are well rendered also. To the film's credit, all of the horses in the film are Icelandic horses, the last remaining pure-bloodline of the original Scandinavian horses used by the Norseman, which they brought to Iceland when they began colonizing. The Scandinavian horses eventually died out on the European mainland, of which the Icelandic horses are directly descended.  <br /> <br />Regrettably, however, Hrothgar's hall Heorot is shown to be an old and dilapidated structure in terrible need of repair, and not the great and mighty hall that the poem tells us it was, full of splendour and ancestral awe.  <br /> <br />As stated above, as a Dark Age tale set in Europe of the deep-rooted past, the film is good. But if you're wanting to see a genuine movie about Beowulf, Grendel, Grendel's mother, the dragon, King Hrothgar, Wyglaf, Ectheow or anything/anyone else relative to the Beowulf mythos, you must do as we've done for centuries: Go to the source material, the original poem.
B000H305U0|3.0|I supposed Justin Timberlake has some creative talents in him. He must, because a former boy band could not last this long without some. What needs to be questions, however, is where does that talent reside? It certainly is not in creativity. It may be as a tribute artist to his idols. And even then it fails. So, maybe isnt really that talented afterall. So why does half this album succeed? <br /> <br />When Ginuwine came up in the mid 90's, he ushered in a new sound that has captivated hip hops listening audiences since. His light vocal range blended brilliantly with the ecclectic sounds behind him, thus changing the way we listen to R&B music in the new millenia. No longer do we require that powerful, infectious voice that can brag one moment and beg another without sounding shallow or pathetic. No, we no longer demand this because the crooner has given way to the producer. Ginuwine started this, but only by osmosis. The real talent ushered in was Timbaland. <br /> <br />And that is what this album is. A dedication to Timbalands creative talents and his ability to manifest sounds no one has ever thought, or known how, to create. Timbaland is the Salvador Dali of hip hop. He is a surrealist, and very good at his craft. <br /> <br />But this a supposed to be a Timberlake album, not a Timbaland. And that is where it fails. When we have to confront Timberlakes credentials, we are left disappointed. For, not only does he mimic Ginuwine in his prime, he also attempts to mimic Prince, Stevie Wonder, and dare I say, Tracy Chapman? The fact is, we dont know who Justin Timberlake is, only who he idolizes and who his producers are. <br /> <br />Timberlake once said he wanted to take it back to the 70's, when being sexy meant something. The first half of the album attempts to reclaim this attitude with the title track, Sexxyback, and My Love. But then it deflates, much like a high from all the use of drugs in the 70s. 'What Goes Around' brings down the sensuality he spends half an album revving up, then he stumbles through his Mr. Ripley act with the ill conceived Chop Me Up, the completely out of place Will.I.Am produced 'Damn Girl', and the gag inducing \\"Summer Love\\". By the time he attempts to spill some socially conscious drab with \\"Losing My Way\\" he has abandoned his original concept for this album. But by the end, it appears Timbaland has abandoned it as well, maybe realizing he can only take Timberlake so far without replacing the artist name on the CD cover. And that may be more telling than anything. Because in the end, this album good only when we can call it a Timbaland album. Timberlake brings only so much.
0385751060|1.0|If you are looking for a book for middle school to high school readers that challenges them to think about the real experiences of children in a brutal fascist state, I would skip this one and read instead \\"Emil and Karl\\", written by Yankev Glatschteyn in 1940 and only recently translated in English. It is also short, also features two naive 9-year-old boys, also gives multiple points of view, and also seems to be trying to send out a wake-up call to young people. The difference is that Emil and Karl is well-written, moving, accurate, and full of well-rounded characters across the spectrum of opinions and backgrounds, while \\"The boy in the striped pajamas\\" is maudlin, insulting, shallow, and inaccurate. It would be good for a literature teacher to assign both books, and let the students see for themselves the difference between quality literature and trash. Don't waste your money on Boyne's weak attempt.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|I noticed that this album is in the 600's on the best selling amazon list.  That's pretty good for an underground metal band i would say.  I'm glad that a good band is finally getting noticed.  In case anyone doesn't know, Amon Amarth is a band that plays a style of death metal dubbed \\"viking metal\\".  Their lyrics, their image, their music is based upon the epic soundscapes of vikings, norse mythology, and battles of honor and glory.  They are much like their death metal cousins, bolt thrower, in that respect.  While bolt thrower pummels us with brutal vocals and riffs everywhere, Amon Amarth throws in deep throat vocals (that can still be understood somehow; what an amazing singer they have!) and a melodic but heavy wall of sound....much like an approaching army!  Over the last few releases, AA have gotten a bit more melodic than their earlier stuff but they get their point across just as well as ever.  <br /> <br />Their previous efffort, the fate of norns, was a good release but it was way too melodic and slow, even by AA standards.  With this release, they pick up the pace quite a bit and once again find the perfect balance between heavy and melodic, epic and to the point. <br /> <br />Tracks 3, 5, 6, and 9 are my favorites.  3 is easily the heaviest, fastest song on the album and it pummels you until the exact second it's over.  Track 9 is a slower (but still retardely heavy) track that captures perfect the epic sound of AA.  On this sound, you have the melodic guitar, the slower melodic parts, the heavier guitar with the faster, more crunchy parts.  The vocals, drums, and bass on this song all come togther with the others and create a very strong song, one of AA's best.  The atompshere on this song is very very dark and full of despair and hoplesness. I love it.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Its hear, real vintage footage from the KISS vaults. The band always said they had it, now they are giving it to us, not just rare footage, but full shows!!! thats awesome, over 7 hours on 2 dvds and for under 30 bucks!!! thats a great deal, KISS gives the fans what they want! Cannot wait for volumes 2 and 3!
B000E6ESL2|5.0|Movies that require thought do not, as a rule, get very good responses in the United States.  Pretentious, artsy fartsy, a con, blah blah blah--these are the labels that unimaginative people or worse, imaginative people who hate being challenged on the wrong day, use to shove these films into a corner.  I sometimes picture them as sitting there with remote control in hand, cocked like a loaded gun, just waiting for some poor SOB with talent and a knack for visuals to make some pernicious masterpiece with the inexcusable motive of wanting to make them think.<br /><br />Most of the reviews of this movie here support my theory.<br /><br />\\"Stay\\" is obviously Lynch inspired (even Ewan McGregor's hair in distinction to his business-like attire suggest an underhanded tribute to our favorite cinematic weirdo), but has a style all its own.  The presence of Naomi Watts as Lila, a manic-depressive painter who just happens to look like a supermodel and be on tons of medication (yes, folks, this is surreality indeed!) immediately recalls to mind her<br /><br />doomed character in the sinister web of \\"Mulholland Drive\\"; the difference between \\"Stay\\" and Lynch's masterpiece is that this ends on a note of hope rather than despair.  This has got to be the best performance Ryan Gosling has ever given, though I'm not sure that's saying a whole hell of a lot.<br /><br />He plays Henry Letham, a suicidal college student obsessed with art and his own culpability in a tragedy hinted at here and there in some disturbing flashbacks.  He is not just a vulnerable young man, however; at times we sense the possibility of real danger in his interactions with McGregor's Sam Foster.  Anyone who was frustrated by the plot and found the movie incomprehensible needs Ritalin or a pair of glasses: all one need do to understand what is really taking place is watch closely when the film shows a car wreck on the Brooklyn Bridge.  Incidentally, Henry is driving, Athena is next to him, and two older people who look very much like two other people we see in the film are in the back.  At the end of the film you see Sam Foster, actually a doctor and not a psychiatrist, shining a light in his badly wounded eyes and imploring him to \\"Stay with us, Henry\\", while Lila, realy a nurse, is right next to him.  The rest is the creation of Henry's tormented mind.  That is the key to the movie and you don't really need two viewings to understand it.<br /><br />While this is the kernel of the carnival of perceptions that happens around us, you could also interpret Henry's motives in a different way; perhaps he was really thinking of the fictional painter Tristan Reveur (\\"an elegant suicide is the perfect work of art\\") when he crashed into the car in front of him, allowing it to happen without really understanding the consequences.  I only even consider this because it doesn't appear Henry was a happy guy in the first place and the movie is very chilling.<br /><br />At times this movie has unbelievable power.  When Sam goes to visit Henry's mother, everything is so effectively creepy that you can understand where this is classified as a horror film.<br /><br />Underneath all the madness and terror of Henry's limbo-like state of delusion is the dilemma of \\"the final moment\\": when we are on death's door, at risk of being killed, seriously injured, diagnosed with a terminal disease et al, sometimes we get the benefit of seeing intuitively how valuable life really is, whatever we may have thought before the danger strikes.  This is Henry's normal state of consciousness because he is indeed dying this entire time and has not had the courage to transcend his fears and ask Athena to marry him or clear the air with his parents.  This is why Sam Foster says, at the end, \\"Henry, if this is a dream, the whole world's in it!\\"  We can only fully appreciate the vividness and beauty of things (hence Henry's interest in painting, his extraordinary talent) when we don't have them right in our graspanymore.  I would recommend this movie to people who still have some speculative energy inside them; for the rest, stick with \\"King of the Hill\\".ur grasp anymore.  I would recommend this movie to people who still have some speculative energy inside them; for the rest, stick with \\"King of the Hill\\".
B00006GA4C|5.0|I wish GF would have kept to this consistently good rock instead of going to a more commercially oriented pop sound. Jeez this was a fine album. <br />
B00000634J|5.0|\\"Lennon Legend\\" is a twenty track, one disc overview of John Lennon's solo career, released in 1997. It is remastered, but unlike the new \\"Working Class Hero\\" compilation, it is not remixed, so the levels and presence of all the instruments will be just how you'll remember from the radio.    I'm a big Beatles fan, being one of my favorite groups, and it's hard to choose a favorite member between the four of them. I do like John's work a lot though. He's very good at capturing his life on tape, I think is the best way to sum it up. His loves, his hates, his hopes, his dreams and his reaction to celebrity are all here, all with a really special personality to them that's hard to really put a finger on. Now, an awful lot of bands and singers talk about their celebrity status these days in music, but for the most part it's not half as interesting or as honest as the way John does it. (Bands like Pink Floyd and Marillion also have a bit to say about the rock'n'roll merry go round too, in a rather heartbreaking way, but that's another story...)    The tracks on this CD range from non-album singles of the late 1960s (\\"Give Peace a Chance\\",\\"Cold Turkey\\",etc) all the way to songs from the Double Fantasy/Milk & Honey sessions the year of his death in 1980. The tracklisting isn't in any real order, though it does go sort of chronological in the middle, while the beginning and end are just a mix of his late 1960s/early 1970s stuff.    Here's a rundown of what tracks come from where:    3 tracks from the \\"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\\" LP (1970)  2 tracks from the \\"Imagine\\" LP (1971)  No tracks from the \\"Sometime In New York City\\" LP (1972)  1 track from the \\"Mind Games\\" LP (1973)  2 tracks from the \\"Walls and Bridges\\" LP (1974)  1 track from the \\"Rock 'n Roll\\" LP (1975)  4 tracks from the \\"Double Fantasy\\" LP (1980)  2 tracks from the \\"Milk and Honey\\" LP (1984)    There are 5 tracks (Instant Karma! Power To The People, Cold Turkey, Happy Xmas & Give Peace a Chance) which were originally non-album singles, but you can pick some up on CDs of John's earlier albums as bonus tracks.    Even though it is a compilation, I think the photography in this compilation has become rather iconic and influential in it's own way. Check out the front cover of Jet's 2006 album \\"Shine On\\" and compare, it's kind of similar (with the black and white photo, big patch of black and those type of sunglasses). The booklet of the CD contains more photographs of John, along with pics of Phil Spector, George Harrison and Yoko Ono. Haven't seen these pictures anywhere else, and they're nice to have. Lyrics in the booklet would have been nicer (there aren't any here) but anyway.    Though it's not every track that I think says the most about John, all the hits and all the essential tracks are here, and this disc would be a great addition to any CD collection, especially for Beatles fans. Give John a chance!
B000HT386M|3.0|Click isn't a bad movie.  It's just not a very funny or original one.  With a plot that could have been culled from an array of anthology shows, or even a sketch comedy show (I did see it done on one), Sandler and co. tread on dangerous, often predictable ground.  The movie almost succeeds, but fails because it doesn't know whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama. <br /> <br />The film features a well intentioned father who is a workaholic that works hard because he believes it will ultimately be better for his family.  He wishes life were a lot easier and while out to purchase a universal remote for his TV, runs into the mysterious Morty who gives him a \\"universal\\" remote.  Supposedly, comedy should ensue. <br /> <br />Here is where problems come in.  Watching Sandler glide through the future after his remote continually fast forwards, we are given dreary future events.  Occaisonally, there are spotty laughs, usually regarding sex or bodily function.  Either way, they are crude and inappropriate for the tone of the rest of the film. <br /> <br />Then there are similarities between It's a Wonderful Life/Scrooge, and any number of stories that ask \\"what if\\" and in the end, present themselves as cautionary tales.  This film is very predictable from start to finish. <br /> <br />There are moments to this film - and the big moment is Sandler.  Sandler has been positioned as a sort of everyman who somehow succeeds in all his films.  He has a likeability that allows him to succeed in spite of the material.  However, scripts often have lewd humor that keep Sandler from reaching his potential, as he did in Spanglish, Puch Drunk Love, and even in earlier comedies like the Wedding Singer.  Take the unneccessary humor away and you have a much more watchable, if predictable, movie to watch.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|George Benson once said \\"people are going to remember you/your show, NOT for how much you impressed them, but for how Good you made them feel\\". I'm a strong believer of that theory. And this CD, makes a PERFECT example. <br /> <br />I own all her Cd's (I hope so) and I've never had as much fun since \\"Stepping Out\\". I went to Tower Records and listened to, pretty much the whole cd. I thought I'll get it next time, because I was trying to save up for a family trip. I went home... and it haunted me! I reached for it in my purse to play in my car on the way home, thinking that I bought it. I went home and made dinner, and again, wanting to play it. And then I dreamt all night about it! So. I had to buy it first thing in the morning. NO REGRETS. I had to have it. And I'm glad I do. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Buy it.
031236198X|5.0|Myths and fables hold important lessons within their memorable plots and characters -- and that is part of the appeal of this new book from John Kotter.  Our ability to relate to and identify with these characters helps us to imagine applying Kotter's 8 change steps to our own complex situations.  Fred, Jordan, Louis, Sally Ann, Nono, Alice, and the rest of the 'plucked from real-life' characters in this change fable want you to see the plan in action.  This quick, entertaining read is also beautifully illustrated.  Those who have seen Kotter teach will attest to his extraordinary skill as a storyteller.  To some extent, that experience of seeing him \\"live\\" is captured in the pages of this charming little book.
B000GY729M|5.0|It took me a couple spins to really get a feel for their second album. This seems to be the consensus for all the reviews here.  I was a huge fan of their first album and didn't really expect anything to topple their singles from their last album (Midnight Show was great, though not a radio topper). However, as a whole and complete album, this one beats their freshman effort. I can sit down and listen to this from beginning to end!<br /><br />I'll tell you that I'm more of an electro-synthpop fan, so for me to enjoy this album more than the last one, speaks volumes about the quality of the music here. Flowers' vocals are much more raw and unfiltered, which for me, seems like a throwback to the 80's. The music stylings are varied yet keep the mood consistent throughout. In the back of my mind, I can visualize the energy they were going for (springsteen energy) and it definitely works for them... and for me too!<br /><br />EXCELLENT!
B000001FNL|5.0|Most people would remember only the Disco tracks \\"Jive Talkin'\\" and \\"Nights on Broadway\\".  A few more people will even remember the ballad \\"Fanny, be Teneder\\".  Programming your CD player for only those tracks will result in missing out on a wonderful music oddesey. <br /> <br />For example, there is the overlooked Disco-infused \\"Wind of Change\\" with it's unforgettible orchestral hooks, trademark harmony, and gutiar hooks.  It's hard to describe why I love this song so much. You GOTTA hear it to really apperciate it. <br /> <br />Then there is the the Barry ballad \\"Songbird\\".  A sad, but heartouching song with an orchestra backdrop. <br /> <br />Next, you have \\"All this Making Love\\".  A naughty ditty with a Queen-like rock beat and old-fashion piano riffs. <br /> <br />Robin + Piano + Orchestra = \\"Country Lanes\\" = PURE MAGIC!!!! <br /> <br />Experience the Country/Western side of the Brothers Gibb in the tracks \\"Come on Over\\" and \\"Baby as You Turn Away\\".  Slow tempo gems with great music and trademark Harmonies. <br /> <br />Last, but definately NOT least, \\"Edge of the Universe\\".  My personal favorite, has a Country-Rock theme with an interesting subject, and elaborate musical backdrop which includes at lesat three gutiars. <br /> <br />In conclusion, the best (and ONLY) way to truly appreciate this record (and the Bee Gees), is to simply place the CD into the player, press \\"Play\\", and enjoy.
0618680004|1.0|It is the religion of man all over again. Science by definition can accept no theory outside that of natural phenomenon (look it up in the dictionary). We shouldn't be surprised, therefore, when scientists prop themselves up by tearing down ideas outside of their discipline.<br /><br />We however, were given more ability to reason than simply \\"test in the physical world and see if we can prove it. If we can't prove it, it cannot be.\\" What of the other disciplines? History, philosophy, etc? What of common sense?<br /><br />As I study evolution, I find it ridiculous. The presumptions and assumptions that make the theory possible are also based on faith, thus negating its scientific credentials. Just because species share similarities, does not mean they came from each other. It could just as easily mean they share a creator.<br /><br />The only reason evolution has the support it does today is due to the generations of indoctrination it has received in the public schools, unable by law to present alternatives. Scientists pat each other on the back for their feeble attempts to fill the straw man they have created to dismiss God.<br /><br />How many things do you know of that come about by accident? Where did the energy from the big band come from? Why do we accept a theory that goes against the accepted second law of thermodynamics? Etc, Etc, Etc...<br /><br />Man tries hard to dismiss God, because once dismissed, man can do whatever he wants. He can, \\"be his own God\\". It worked well for Hitler and his attempt to create the \\"master race\\", at least that is until he met his maker. Scientists believe that if you say something long enough, in the absence of alternatives, it will become truth. Sorry, truth is truth.<br /><br />Do not be fooled by scientists telling you that science is the answer. Just because we cannot prove God in the lab, does not mean God doesn't exist. Prove love, faith, thought, anger, etc. Enter the argument with your eyes wide open./>
B000GG4KTU|4.0|Diana Krall's music can be a real hit-or-miss thing with me - her voice is enjoyable but not always her biggest strength. Yet with the right arrangement framing her vocals her music can be irresistible. With the right arrangement, what sells Krall's vocals is her superb sense of rhythm and timing. In that sense she's similar to Fred Astaire - he had a very thin, reedy quality to his voice but because he was the consummate dancer, rhythm simply oozed from every fiber of his being. More than his film recordings, this quality is evident in his jazz recordings with Oscar Peterson from the fifties. In this tradition, From This Moment On is one of Krall's strongest and most enjoyable efforts. She receives superb musical backing from the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra -- the arrangements hum with energy, especially the swing numbers, which are fantastic. \\"From This Moment On\\" has an incredible, manic rhythm (and features some swinging brass) to it that reminded me of recordings of the song's original bow on Broadway in Kiss Me, Kate. Krall's interpretation of \\"Come Dance With Me\\" rivals Frank Sinatra's (from the Capitol Records album of the same name) for energy and exuberance. On the slower side of things, Krall gives a touching interpretation of the Rodgers-Hart classic \\"Little Girl Blue.\\" That song and \\"Willow Weep for Me\\" provides a nice counterpoint to the album's generally upbeat, swing-filled mood. The album is available from Target with one bonus track -- \\"My Shining Hour.\\" This is really a very enjoyable album -- one gets the sense that Krall was incredibly relaxed and comfortable when making this record, freeing her to really have fun and breathe fresh life into these classic songs.
B0000DBJ2B|4.0|I remember seeing little parts of it when i was a kid in a film show back in the 80s and it intrigued and scared me. Last year i was fortunate to see this edition on sale and bought it and was beaming with expectation. So i finally saw the film, after all these years and i'm still intrigued and scared by it! It is visually beautiful and i think that's its strongest asset.  The dialogue can be a bit corny sometimes and the story is very straightfoward (that's not criticism). The score by Trevor Jones is astonishingly inspired and memorable. I wish i could find the soundtrack cd sometime soon cause it's just amazing! On the whole a wonderful, lush, inspiring motion picture any fantasy fan must own!

B000FTWB7G|3.0|Amy Lee is this band. I mean can anyone actually name those other guys behind her strumming the guitars and banging on the drums? Evanescence is quite easily one of the most over rated bands on this planet and yet some times its justified but most of the time its not. Amy Lee is fantastic and her voice is like a drug. No matter how generic the music I find myself intoxicated with the emotional pull of her dramatic vocals. Its moody, its atmospheric and when your in the right mood it works.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately all fairy tales must come to an end and you can only ignore the generic compositions for so long until you want to just bang your ahead against the wall if you hear another boring Drop D guitar riff.  <br /> <br />Honestly...see those things called strings? Yes their are alot of notes on that guitar...USE THEM!  Its obvious this band is a one trick pony because they simply cannot compose music for the life of them. Its the same sound and every track is saved by the entrancing Amy Lee. Its the Amy Lee band + 3 and if you don't see that you really need to wake up and smell the corporate coffee.   <br /> <br />Origin was a great record and Fallen was redundant but still good, The Open Door is more of the same but not enough of Origin and way too much Fallen. Its COMPOSITION that makes you legendary and its obviously something the other band members simply cannot do. <br /> <br /> For every beautifully written piano goth ballad we get a generic nu-metal rock tune right next to it.  I don't know what can save this band but Amy needs to get a whole new band to back up her talent because sooner or later her magic will wear off and the only thing left will be those three duds behind her making the same noise on every damn record.

B000GY729M|4.0|After reading many of the love-hate reviews below, I have to stick to my own opinion.  I really, really LIKE this CD.  I LOVED Hot Fuss and was looking forward to and expecting Hot Fuss Part Deux.  After the first listen of Sam's Town, I'll admit I was disappointed.  But it only took one more listen to change my mind and to realize I was actually thankful for the differences.  I can't tell you what Brandon Flowers believes or what he's quoted as saying in interviews (as other reviewers have stated) and I don't really care.  I only know what I like and I enjoy The Killers' music, and don't have to agree with the artists to do so.  Are they the best lyrics in the world?  No, but this is entertainment, not philosphy.  What I enjoy the most about The Killers is their passion. Flowers is a theatrical frontman - moreso in vocals than in actions. So their image has changed from the first CD.  Big deal.  They're artists and therefore can reinvent themselves for every CD if they want to.  If their music is good enough, they shouldn't lose too many fans over it. I think the best musician in the group is Ronnie Vanucci - the drummer.  My one complaint is that Brandon does sing off-key in several songs on Sam's Town.  I don't understand why the producers didn't correct this.  In all of the live performances I've seen on TV he seems to run out of breath, losing control of his voice and then sings flat or sharp.  However, I didn't notice this when I went to a Hot Fuss concert last year.  Either he's a heavy smoker or he just needs to learn to breath while he's singing - (sing from his diaphragm).  I love the passion in his voice, but for long term, live concert performances, he really needs to make some changes or his voice could eventually suffer.  Having said that, I still recommend Sam's Town.  Looking forward to what The Killers will come up with next.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|1. This movie is much better than my wife and I expected.  To be sure, there are big departures from Jane Austen's book and the tale seems tailored to a modern audience.  Nevertheless, we're giving this production five stars, because of its overall impact and flow.  The acting and location shots are first-rate and key scenes are so beautifully done.  We particularly liked the scene near the end where Elizabeth entreats her father so she might marry Mr. Darcy.  She reveals how Darcy is the one who bailed out the Bennett family from Mr. Wickham's debts and also arranged for sister Lydia's marriage. This ending seems more convincing than other versions we've seen because it registers with Mr. Bennett that Darcy is the one who saved the family.  If you look it up, the bail-out revelation is in the book. <br />2. Viewers may want to turn on English subtitles in places so as to get all the dialogue.  This is a British production making it hard for we Americans to follow at times.  An idea raised by another reviewer is also a good one, namely, to turn on the director's commentary when you have time to re-view the movie.  A lot of things come out you would not know otherwise, making this a deeper film than what you first saw.  Not all the director's comments are profound but when he tells you he devoted 2 years of his life to the film (morning, noon, and night) you need to pay attention.  Also, we're told why Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle are given a tour of sculptures at Pemberley rather than seeing portraits of the Darcy family.  Sure, the scene departs from the book, as so many other things do, but it's awfully well done. <br />3. This movie runs only 2 hours, so its character development pales in comparison with miniseries that were done by the BBC in 1979 and by A&E in 1995.  On DVD, these productions run 4 and 5 hours, respectively.  To really understand the story line most viewers should see one or both of these and even read the book.  Key characters like Wickhamand Mr. & Mrs. Collins barely have cameo roles in the 2005 movie which is a pity.  Also, time constraints may have precluded showing more on the special relationship between Mr. Bennett and his second daughter, Elizabeth, who may really be his alter ego. <br />4. In other respects, it's apparent that the producer and director wanted to stage this movie a lot differently than previous versions.  The Bennett family is seen living a very rustic life with pigs, geese, and dogs underfoot.  This is a major departure from life discussed in the book and depicted in other film and TV versions.  This movie is set in the year, 1797, not 1813, as previously understood.  In another departure, the opening ballroom scene is far more informal and earthy than what we've seen before. But it has an infectious energy that prepares you for the rest of the show.  Yes, this version is going to be different from other ones! <br />5. For most of the movie, Elizabeth runs around in very casual attire with her hair wild and unkempt.  All the while she states her opinions freely and is not bashful about offending others, including her poor mother.  In many ways, Lizzy seems like a wild animal that may appeal to Darcy's basic instincts. This is another big departure from the book and from past productions where the eldest Bennett girls are seen as well-dressed and presentable, desperate as they are to find good husbands.  The \\"car wreck\\" scene where Elizabeth rejects Darcy and his first marriage proposal may be the most powerful moment in the movie.  Darcy, despite his imposing size and presence, appears lucky Elizabeth didn't have a club nearby when she rejected him.  What a contrast to the second proposal where Darcy stammers out his love for her and Elizabeth accepts him while gently taking his hand.  Brilliantly done! <br />6. Music has been an important element in past productions of Pride and Prejudice and it is here, as well.  The Baroque-era music played at the balls is our favorite kind.   Also, the haunting piano theme heard throughout the show is extremely well done and played.  Bravo! <br />7. Although the casting of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett may have raised some eyebrows we thought he did quite well, especially at the end where he talks to Elizabeth about Darcy's second proposal.  Keira Knightley is marvelous as the untamed Elizabeth, Mr. Bennett's favorite daughter.  Matthew MacFadyen is a revelation as Darcy.  In truth, Matthew looks like such a physical specimen he might have playing linebacker for the Green Bay Packers.  What's just as amazing is that when he speaks he sounds like an educated, British gentleman.  Actors portraying Mrs. Bennett, Jane Bennett, Mr. & Mrs. Collins, Lady Catherine DeBourgh, Mr. & Miss Bingley, and the other Bennett sisters were fine, too.  Mr. Bingley did seem a bit foppish at times, but in contrast to MacFadyen's Darcy, it's not surprising. <br />8. At the end, Elizabeth seems to blame herself completely for misjudging Darcy.  He comes off then as pride-free and irresistible.  Some might feel this is taking one too many liberties with Jane Austen's message.  Actually, Darcy has been changed and humbled by Elizabeth's rejection of his first proposal.  It takes several months for a transformation to be completed and for Darcy to do heroic deeds.  He then becomes acceptable to her and us.  The movie's producer and director may have been aware of this fact but with only 2 hours to work with simply couldn't show it.  Or, maybe they just wanted to stress that rich people have their problems, too? <br />9. Comparisons to the other versions of Pride and Prejudice are difficult.  For us, the wit and elegance of the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version from 1995, may never be surpassed.  Also, the 1979 miniseries with Elizabeth Garvie, David Rintoul, and Judy Parfitt has special moments.  The 1940 version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier deserves attention as well, even though it takes even more liberties with Jane Austen's story than the others.  In style and substance, the 2005 version is quite different from earlier ones but it is effective and entertaining.  Our sense is to get and study them all.  The timeless story and characters make for a masterpiece in English literature and a study of human nature.  If nothing else, the happy ending of the 2005 version is classic. <br />10. Special features on the 2005, DVD include interviews with the producer, the director, and the main characters.  There is some repetition, but their comments offer more insights into why this story is so appealing. Too bad other productions haven't offered interviews of the leading stars in this way.  Maybe we'll see them some day in a super-gold, Nth anniversary, collectors' edition? <br />
B000H305U0|5.0|Are you guys serious?  This CD is SOOO off the hook!  I must admit that I never thought I'd own a Justin Timberlake CD, let alone play it all the time in my car.  I pretty much love every song on the CD and the falsetto sound is so beautiful on the \\"slow song\\" tracks.  This CD is definitely worth the money.
B000AP04OM|5.0|\\"You have brought music back into my home\\".  This is a story about a man, who lost his wife, suffered loneliness, realized the value of his family and embraces his family once again in music and drama, and falls in love with a woman of great culture and life.<br /><br />Tensions are high between Germany and Austria.  Nazi Germany threats to occuppy Austria, raping the country of his sovereignty and independance.  The Van Trap family represents the Austrian culture, naval might, and defiance of their conquerors.<br /><br />The Sound of Music withstands the test of time: scenery, key landmarks, picture quality alp mountains, and religous moral ideals. Julie Andrews represents the spirit of independant woman, the virtueous ideals of Mary, the zest for experience and excitement and life, and the moral courage to stand up against evil.  I saluate this great movie and recommend it to all viewers that follow my reviews.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|What viewers have to understand about this movie is that it pays homage to all those movie serials of the '30's and '40's and television serials of the '50's. Is it as good as Spielberg's 'Raiders' series? It is the same and different: like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' it is a loving tribute to the early days of filmmaking with more special effects. It is reminiscent of actor Buster Crabbe and the serials 'Buck Rogers' and 'Captain Video.' Like those series, this movie succeeds in capturing the early science fiction view of killer robots and mad scientists. Jude Law and Gwyenth Paltrow are very likable as the lead characters trying to save the world from the evil Dr. Totenkopf. Angelina Jolie and her beautiful lips, however, only make what amounts to a cameo appearance. The basic fact of this movie is this: if you enjoy nostalgia and old movies ('Metropolis', 'Things To Come', etc.), I believe you will enjoy this film immensely. If, on the other hand, your tastes run to more modern films which star the Special Effects people ('Terminator', 'The Matrix', etc.) rather than the actors, or, films rooted in the 'now,' you will be disappointed by this film. I urge you to watch this movie with an open mind and then go out and discover the early days of cinema.
0140187537|5.0|This book is a perfect way to become deeply enveloped in the psychology of a loveable man grappling with the temptations of corruption, greed, and adultery. The characters are vivid and personal, and often we are privy to their most intimate- and amusing- thoughts. Steinbeck is a master of recreating the essence of a culture, and he successfully creates this New England town which remains steeped in its own quaint history despite the increasing infringements of modern life. As with much Steinbeck, it is the characters and the culture that make this short novel great, and I highly recommend it.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I will start this off by saying that if Iron Maiden weren't my favorite band, I'd probably give this album a four, but I love this album so much more than that so I can't settle for a four.<br /><br />People seem very divided about this album.  I personally think that it is stronger than Dance of Death and equal to Brave New World, though completely different from it.  The production is the perfect sound for Maiden, many people complain about it but honestly I think it works perfectly for the album and for the band.  It is similar to the sound they had on albums like Piece of Mind, the bass is loud and in your face, the guitars scream when necessary, and the drumming is powerful.<br /><br />As for the song writing, I believe that there is truth to the fact that the intros can get tiresome.  Still, I think that all of the intros are appropriate EXCEPT on The Longest Day, which could have been cut in half.  Still, Maiden (and Harris in particularly) has always been about giving you something good and then giving you more of it then you need, excess excess excess.  I personally think that this works for them and the lyrical content of the songs, the music fits all of this pretty perfectly.  Many people are comparing the album to Seventh Son of a Seventh Son but I would say it's more like The X Factor, dark, mid-paced, lots of clean guitar, and more complex song arrangements.  Once again, I see this as a good thing because I believe that The X Factor is a very underrated album.  Still, this is about A Matter of Life and Death.<br /><br />There are many powerful moments on this album and there are several points that could be considered the climax.  Whether you want to argue for the odd-timed galloping in Brighter Than a Thousand Sons, the instrumental section of The Longest Day, the lead section 4:50 into The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg, or the last 3-4 minutes of The Legacy, you can't go wrong.  Every song has something that will make it your favorite of the album for at least a day or two.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say that this album is just as good as anything Maiden has ever released.  It really takes multiple listens for you to catch every guitar lick, every drum fill, every lyric, and every note that Harris plays.  For those who want to argue that Janick should be kicked out of the band, all I have to ask is why?  Firstly, the man is a talented guitarist and brings good song-writing to the band.  Secondly, he has been a part of the band for 16 years and 7 albums, he's as much a part of the band as Adrian Smith.  Third, he adds more depth to the band and the songs with the ability to use three guitar parts.  Some would say that this is not done anyway but if you play an instrument you should be able to notice all three guitarists and three different parts throughout a lot of the album.  Sure, you could use studio magic to add a third guitar to the harmonies or to add a solo over a harmony but I believe that you can hear a difference in all three of their's solos and leads.  There's no logical reason to kick him out.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is one of the best metal albums of the new millenium and is equal to anything Maiden has put out.  I'm not saying it's better than The Number of the Beast or Somewhere in Time, it's different but there is just as much depth and as much to enjoy.  Give it a chance and try to appreciate it as its own album rather than comparing it to the older stuff and you will find that this is a very strong album.two.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|For those like me with little time to watch television and no money for Tivo, buying this DVD set was a godsend. Playing catch-up with Supernatural Season One was well worth it. This show is remarkable. The writing, acting and directing are all superb and well crafted. Each episode is connected, vibrant and genuinely fun to watch. Any fan of horror, sci-fi, comedy, or just good entertainment will get their money's worth.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Although it's nice to finally have the original movies which made George Lucas into the mogul he is today on dvd, the quality of these versions are low-quality 4 x 3 letterboxed transfers from video.  Why do we have to choose between an edited goofy new scenes version and a low quality original?  I want the original films in high quality transfers and when HD discs come out, in HD quality as well.  Easy to do for Lucasfilm.
B000621P7Y|5.0|Choreographed to utter perfection, the love story between two inspiring young characters from different worlds grows through a masterpiece of dancing blended from steps in their special journey together. Beautiful Katey(Romola Garai) finds all the ingredients: to be special, important, wanted and needed in a guy who completes her in the passion for dancing, and wins in a national dance competition that spectacularly surprises her parents and old friends. Her dedication to help Javier yields a bitter-sweet reward as they both get more than they expected in freedom, intimacy, and royalty in the world of great music and rhythm that make their last dance the dance of a lifetime. This movie is truly delightful to watch over and over. The captivating music, creative dance, and wonderful love story all come together in a symbolic journey through life!
B00004WG2F|2.0|More predictable than an old TV Land episode of Bonanza and much less entertaining, this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons, one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system, one an idealist, and the middle son, Tristan, played by Brad Pitt, a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature's anger. At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing. I don't think there's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone. It's not spectacular in its setting, it's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story, and I found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring. To each his own, I know some love this movie, but from where I sit, this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff.
B000HIVO64|5.0|Rumor is on the street that Beck was deep in the mix on this project then abandoned it to release \\"Guero\\" instead. Next thing he knew, he was overseeing \\"Guerolito\\" and embroiled in a seemingly non-stop tour in support of both of those runaway projects.<br /><br />It's no secret that while I enjoyed much of the music on \\"Guero\\", the whole thing smacked of a rush job, ultimately feeling more like a compilation of outtakes and b-sides than a truly new Beck album. Thankfully for the faithful Beck doesn't like to leave unfinished works lying around the studio for very long. Thus we are treated easily to the fourth home run in Mr. Hansen's career.<br /><br />If I were to sum it up as neatly as a Christmas package wrapped by the Bloomingdale's gift center, then I would have to unabashedly exclaim that this is easily the best thing Beck has done other than \\"Odelay\\", \\"Mutations\\", and \\"Sea Change\\".<br /><br />The most notable thing about \\"The Information\\" is that it's an album. It flows beautifully from start to finish, never causing you to extend your index finger to the fast-forward function. You will, undoubtedly, find yourself pressing replay and repeat for a number of the tracks, though. In fact, if you only had three songs to spend any amount of time with, I'd place my money on 'Think I'm in Love', 'Soldier Jane', and 'Dark Star'. Seriously, I've been slipping these into repeat for the past week, playing them over and over again until the combined elements of their melodic structure have synched in my cerebellum creating an airy mist of Beck intonation that drones on in endlessly hypnotical waves of bliss. What more could you ask for? Not much, I would reckon.<br /><br />The aforemention tracks reverberate with loping basslines and Beck's dreamy baritone mumble and esoteric non-sequitors. If one were hard-pressed to name the heir apparent to Michael Stipe (legendary \\"Murmur\\"-era Stipe, mind you), then Beck would be the A-1 tip-top choice, hands down. For example, on 'Dark Star' Beck intones something akin to \\"Disappointment condition/A perfunctory prescription/Of an indigent mindset/A belligerent silence/We got all we need/Turning out of a tin can...\\" Besides that, these three songs illustrate a wonderfully succinct culmination of everything he's done prior, melding gentle funk atmospherics with snippets of blues squonk, folk rustication, and classic rock brilliance. Ah, you know what? That's more a description of the entire album, these tracks as well.<br /><br />While the holy triumvirate I've ladled overflowing praise on are certainly worthy of the hype, the rest of the album is just as sweet. Whether it's the electro ping-pong shuffle of 'We Dance Alone,' the futuro shanty joust of 'Nausea,' the Janis Joplin inspired rolling thunder honky tonk revue stylings of 'Strange Apparition' or the lurch-n-grind sampledelia of '1000BPM,' Beck unleashes every trick in his bag and brings forth the ultimate culmination of his past experiments in stylistic convergence. It's as if he finally got a grip on his aural ADD, grabbing hold of all the diverse and often at odds with one another musical ideas bouncing around inside his cranium, rolled 'em all up in a giant rubber band ball and then spent countless hours sitting in a deck chair on his driveway while bouncing it against the garage door.<br /><br />While tunes like 'Motorcade' and 'New Round' mix quaint elements of nursery rhyme inspired bed time lullabies and front porch folksiness, they still incorporate plenty of electronic blip and blurps, but all done in tasteful moderation. Meanwhile something like the bloated 'The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton,' which ends the album on a lengthy 10-minute and 36-second note, is like a wonderfully stilted post-post-post-modern re-examination of what prog rock might sound like as concocted by a cross-eyed, Tourette's suffering autistic genius.<br /><br />To put it all in a succinctly bundled puch, try to imagine a piece of pink-to-ruby red Ahi Tuna seared just to perfection. If you could translate such an epicurean metaphor into a musical odyssey, then you'd most likely end up with \\"The Information\\". That said, I highly recommend that you get the 411 and that you get it from Beck his own bad self. Trust me, your head will be well fed.<br /><br />Standouts:<br /><br />\\"Elevator Music\\"<br /><br />\\"Think I'm in Love\\"<br /><br />\\"Soldier Jane\\"<br /><br />\\"New Round\\"<br /><br />\\"Dark Star\\"<br /><br />\\"We Dance Alone\\"pink-to-ruby red Ahi Tuna seared just to perfection.

B000H7J9RQ|5.0|What can I say about this item? Buy it. <br />I remember I first saw this concert on VHS back in high school.  I never was a hardcore streisand fan.  But this concert blows me away.  At first I loved \\"Send in The Clown\\" \\"It's A New World\\", and \\"Happy Days\\".  But after a few runs, I got to love all the songs.  Her voice is impeccable and her concentration is beyond description.  Anyone, her fan or not, will surely realize why she is a \\"legend\\" after watching this.  None of her following concerts can compare to this one.  Most importantly, you won't get to see a streisand who is too demanding, who has too strong a persona, or who is too self-conscious, which can make people tired sometimes.  You get to see her as a singer with a great voice.  That's all.  And that's what makes her best.
B000BNI99K|5.0|Finally,this marvelous work is cornered and boxed for your listening and dancing pleasure.Legions of fans have expressed their raving reviews and I'd humbly wish to add mine.The obvious secret of this projects success begins with the actual song selections. Where on earth,did Rod's team unearth these musical gems? For too long, many of these tunes were ignored for weeks on end without the proper vocal appreciation.This set demonstrates Rod's artistic ability to change the musical winds and elevate this material to the precipice,on which it richly deserves to rest.Second,an equally important,are the musical arrangements represented throughout this work.Simply put, Jackie Gleason would blush with envy. Rod and company have guided these charts in a direction other arrangers fear to tread.Last but not least,Rod's unnatural ability to deconstruct these musical treasures acts as the tipping point to their universal appeal. His energy and artistic perspiration are evident throughout this classic series.My only disappointment,rests with the fact that Rod may have concluded his recorded exploration of the Great American Standards.However,it's whispered, among fans, that a G.A.S.box set containing rarities,b/c,d sides, outtakes, alt.takes and demo's may still see the light of day.Hopefully,the legendary and much bootlegged,Makin Whoopee,alt.take#38 will be included. Sadly,as Rod turns his talent towards recording the entire classic RocknRoll canon,other side projects have been abandoned or delayed. The much anticipated,Rod Sings the Work of Stephen Foster, has,I understand, been shelved.However, there's still some hope the rumoured recording of, Rod Humms the Ray Noble Classics Live on the Beach at St Tropez,accompanied by only a gin and lemmon squash, will possibly see a future release date. Until then, remember,a day without Rod's music is a non-rodday.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|The fact that I am taking the time to post, speaks volumes about how special I think Continuum is...I often find myself \\"suckered\\" into buying a CD these days, because a track suggests that the rest of the album may prove to be a pleasant surprise. It is a bit like the movie trailer that entices you to head to the theater, only to be disappointed that you have already seen the only enjoyable part of the movie. Continuum is the exception to that unfortunate rule...It is an extraordinary piece of work.
6304698798|5.0|One of Leone's most memorable flicks,Clint Eastwood reprises his role for the third time as the man with no name,or Blondie,in this flick.In this installment,a kind of Rat Race-type situation occurs where a lone ranger,a robber,and a baddie get involved in a plot to get $50,000 first.There begind a perilous journey of betrayal,murder,and revenge.I especially like the character Tuco,with his quick,fast wit and hillarious habits,it's hard not to laugh.Lee Van Clef is also brilliant as angel Eyes,the baddie in the flick who tries to take out Blondie and Tuco.It's a roller coaster ride to the end.
B000001GQP|5.0|Maybe just like most other people, I heard bits of the first piece of \\"Carmina Burana\\" - I think it was as part of a chocolate commercial (back in Germany). When I saw that that was actually the very first piece, I wondered what could possibly come after that, and I did a bit of research into what the music was all about. The result of that search made it all the more interesting: It's medival poems and songs, partly in Latin, partly in old German, set to the music of Carl Orff.  <br /> <br />I went through a bunch of other recordings of \\"Carmina Burana\\" until I finally found this one. This one is the best. I mean you can complain about aspects of it, but with the composer working with the conductor it's a bit hard to say anything meaninful. If you don't like the way this sounds then maybe you just don't like the full piece. For example, I've seen people praise other recordings because they sounded \\"less teutonic\\". That's quite a ridiculous comment - after all, that's what it's supposed to sound like. And it's Latin (or old German) and that's just what Latin sounds like.  <br /> <br />So I can only recommend this recording, it's quite impressive, and it's quite heavy in the percussion - make sure to listen to it loud at least once.
B000G759LW|4.0|Much like Justin Timberlake, I wasn't originally a fan of Christina Aguilera. I thought she was insanely hot, but that was really it. Until I heard \\"Dirty\\" for the first time. Not only was my dawg Red involved, but it was a hot track anyway. I bought Stripped and I have say that I really like that album, I just can't help it. So basically, Christina's my girl, so I was definitely looking forward to this album. Since this is a two-disc CD, I'm going to review them seperately in the same review. <br />  <br />DISC ONE (a.k.a. the DJ Premier Disc): <br />  <br />When I heard that Primo was exec producing one of the discs, I did back flips. Especially when I heard that Mark Ronson was also lending his talents. Needless to say, the production on this disc is excellent. Premier did a great job of adapting his style to fit Christina, while still keeping some of the gutter GangStarr feel. <br />  <br />\\"Ain't No Other Man\\" is a great single, I wasn't a huge fan at first, but it grew on me very quickly. There are some other good tracks on this disc, which has a more uptempo hip hop/R&B feel to it then disc two. There's even a diss track (\\"F.U.S.S.\\"). <br />  <br />DISC TWO (a.k.a the Linda Perry Disc): <br />  <br />I'm definitely a bigger Primo fan than Linda Perry, but \\"Beautiful\\" was a good song, so I had high hopes for this disc too. It definitely has a less R&B, more throwback soul/jazz/blues vibes, which works great in some cases (\\"I Got Trouble\\") and not so well in others (\\"Candyman\\"). <br />  <br />Overall, Back To Basics (both discs) is a very good album. It's not as good as Stripped, but I think that it shows that Christina is still growing as an artist and is someone to keep an eye on. <br />  <br />The good: <br />  <br />(DISC ONE): DJ Premier; good single; some other hot tracks like \\"Back In The Day\\" & \\"Still Dirrty\\"; \\"Slow Down Baby\\" is my jam right now; gotta love the Scott Storch diss. <br />  <br />(DISC TWO): I love \\"I Got Trouble\\"; the old school jaxx feel is pretty cool; a couple of other good tracks like \\"Welcome\\" & \\"Mercy On Me\\". <br />  <br />The bad: <br />  <br />(DISC ONE): Not enough stand out tracks; \\"Thank You\\" doesn't work for me; would have liked one hot guest verse (a'la Redman); I have a soft spot for Scott Storch, since he was the The Roots original keyboardist, so the diss track isn't totally cool haha. <br />  <br />(DISC TWO): Way too short (9 tracks, but 1 is an intro); \\"Candyman\\" is pretty obnoxious; a few songs blend together to me. <br />  <br />The rating: <br />  <br />DISC ONE: 3.5/5.0 <br />  <br />DISC TWO: 3.0/5.0 <br />  <br />OVERALL: 3.5/5.0 <br />
0671027573|5.0|I read Mr Perfect a few years ago and just finished my second reading yesterday. It not only remains one of my favorite romantic suspense books of all time but Linda Howard shows everyone else how to balance romance and suspense in Mr Perfect. <br /> <br />This isn't a perfect romance, as another reviewer also said, but in my case it was because I would have made the heroine with Luna's personality and Jaine, the victim instead. Marci, I did not miss. I found Jaine a little too much like a heroine out of a chick lit romance and would have liked a bit more warmth and femininity in her character. That said, I liked the way she stood up to Sam's surly behavior at the start and her open enjoyment of Sam's 'attributes'. As for Sam, he was Mr Perfect to me. <br /> <br />The romance was very well done inspite of it being lust at first sight for both of them (especially on Jaine's part!) The protagonists' characters engaged me from the start and they are both well-matched. I also liked that Howard reveals the identity of the killer early in the book. This gave me the freedom to enjoy Sam and Jaine's romance without trying to guess who the killer is. Despite this, Howard adds a twist at the end though even if she didn't, I wouldn't have complained. <br /> <br />Mr Perfect was the perfect book to lift an otherwise dull, lethargic mood and if I had to pick one book for a beach resort read, Mr Perfect would have made my vacation just that. Perfect. Of course, if someone like Sam Donovan laid down on the beach next to me, I  might just put the book aside. Temporarily.
B000H305U0|2.0|It took me a while to warm up to Justin Timberlake. I always hated him on principle (even after meeting him at Abner's after a Phil's game). When Justified came out, I had no interest. After hearing more and more tracks from that album, however, I broke down and bought it and ended up liking it. <br /> <br />So I had some expectations for this CD (I wouldn't call them high expectations, but they were expectations nonetheless). All in all, I have to say that I am dissappointed. And I never thought that would be the case with a CD produced almost entirely by Timbaland (although it's not his fault, most of the beats are tight). <br /> <br />Justin seems like he's trying to be Prince on this album. And before you dismiss me as a hater, I love Price. But there's only one Prince, no one else can pull it off (except maybe TQ, that dude does a mean Prince). <br /> <br />Basically, the best advice that I can give is if you like \\"SexyBack\\" then by the CD, if you don't, you'd probably be better off buying something else. <br /> <br />The good: <br /> <br />\\"My Love\\" with T.I. is a hat song; Three 6 Mafia kill \\"Chop Me Up\\" (too bad the hook sucks); I kind of like \\"Damn Girl\\" and I love \\"Losing My Way\\"; Timbo's production is tight. <br /> <br />The bad: <br /> <br />I don't really like any of the rest of the songs; I can't stand \\"Pose\\", when that becomes a #1 single I'm going to jump out of a window. <br /> <br />The rating: <br /> <br />2.0/5.0 <br />

I spent 6 hours today finishing this book and wish there were even more.

I hope she writes more of the same genre.
B00005JPAD|4.0|DeCaprio & Damon are \\"The Departed\\" - men who've gone undercover and created unlikable new identities for themselves.  Damon is Colin Sullivan, a rising star of the \\"Staties\\" (Boston State police) and soon assigned to a high-powered State/Federal career-criminal investigations unit.  Decaprio is Billy Costigan, a loser cut from the Staties soon after gradating the academy, and soon jailed on an assault rap.   <br /> <br />But appearances are deceiving - Costigan's fall from grace was an elaborately orchestrated sham to endear him to Boston's underworld of Irish gangs, allow him entry and destroy it from the inside.  Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) rules this dreary kingdom of protection money, four-letter words and flying fists, and he's is both the target and aggressor of everything that happens there.  To maximize security and nail Costello, the Staties' operation is compartmentalized - only Captain Queenan (Sheen) and his foulmouthed lieutenant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) know the identities of deep-cover operatives like Costigan.  (If Queenan is fatherly, Dignam is like everybody's abusive older-brother; if bad words could kill, Dignam could make blood fly all over the place.)  Unknown to anybody other than Costello, the crime boss has a mole of his own among the Staties - Damon, having been recruited by Costello as a kid.  With law-enforcement looking more like some foreign counter-intelligence operation, the mutual penetration of criminal investigations officials and crime-bosses looks less like a Scorsese-style gangster tale than John LeCarre transplanted to Boston.  Amid Costello's high-powered deals and the Staties' efforts to build a case against him, each side learns that they've got a mole in their midst, forcing Conway & Costigan to play cat and mouse to uncover the traitor while keeping their own cover. <br /> <br />\\"The Departed\\" is a great movie, but not necessarily a great Scorsese movie.  The leads chew up the scenery and beat each other bloody, but thestory never becomes more than one about a bunch of guys shooting, hitting and cursing each other.  The story suggests all sorts of complex weaving subplots, but can't come up with anything more satisfying for closure than having somebody getting royally smacked.  The big draw here are the leads - Nicholson, Damon & DiCaprio.  Even the 2nd stringers here are great - besides Wahlberg, we have Alec Baldwin as the Fed boss of Boston's anti-crime ops, and Sheen who seems to sense that he needs to protect DiCaprio from both sides.  However, the performances are mostly wasted.  Nicholson plays Costello like a straight version of The Joker - he's the arch-villain without the camp (instead of jokes, he gives us tough-guy bromides of how little anything matters about you when you've got a gun to your head).  Damon's character is so determined to look squeaky-clean that he's the least interesting character in the story.  DiCaprio is obviously the focus here, yet we've barely met him before he's subsumed into the invented character he needs to woo Nicholson's gang with, and it's hard not to see anything about him as necessary for his performance as a hood.  Sheen is too nice a guy to be working organized crime while Wahlberg looks too effective (you wonder why he hasn't cracked everybody's case and a few skulls while he's at it).  Critics hail \\"Departed\\" as a return-to-form for Scorsese but it's more a hint of what Scorsese was, and the much better movies he used to make.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|Somewhere in the early '90s, a Hollywood suit said to another, \\"Why don't we make a movie of this,\\" while playing a round of Super Mario Bros. From there on out, moviegoers were 'fortunate' enough to have blockbuster video game adaptations every other year that usually fell under people's acclaim.<br /><br />Resident Evil or Doom, anyone?<br /><br />Roger Avary, one of Hollywood's braniacs and the one responsible for a little-known screenplay called Pulp Fiction, took on the job to adapt this year's video game film release, Silent Hill. The table was certainly sturdy, and all the right cards were laid out - especially when director Christophe Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf) signed on to direct.<br /><br />However, the idea of a movie left an unsettling effect in my stomach. Silent Hill is by far the most terrifying video game to have ever graced a console. The game already borrows a handful of aspects from past films or literature (e.g. Jacob's Ladder and H.P Lovecraft, respectively) and in itself was a movie. The reason for a film fell under the jaw-dropping question, \\"Why?\\"<br /><br />Both Gans and Avary have taken the mood, feeling, and scenery of Silent Hill and literally culled it from the game's platform. There are angles, characters and even set designs that are down to the T. The only problem is there is too much, even coming from such a simple storyline.<br /><br />Once upon a time...<br /><br />Rose, played by the gorgeous Radha Mitchell, decides to bring an end to Sharon's (her foster child) horrible dreams by driving to the abandoned, ghost town of Silent Hill. Along the way, Rose and Sharon bump heads with a do-gooder cop named Cybil. After a near death car chase between the two parties, Rose awakens after the car accident in the infamous town to no daughter and a mysterious fog. What lies behind the fog is for Rose to find out and the audience to wonder.<br /><br />Silent Hill follows the premise of the original 1999 game. Over the past seven years there have been four games from the series, and the downfall of the film is combining each and every element from those games. Everything is there in the film, which happens to be the major predicament. In fact, characters from the original film are split into two or three separate characters all revolving around a plot that becomes misconstrued and highly interchangeable by the film's finale.<br /><br />It's almost like Mortal Kombat: Annihilation all over again.<br /><br />Only here, Gans directs phenomenally. The sound effects are revolting and the special effects are minimal, something any director today should take note of. Silent Hill is, in fact, the same Silent Hill any gamer will remember playing on that old console years ago. Avary is no doubt a fanatic of the game, as all the choices the characters make are nearly the same as the average gamer's. I found myself jokingly saying, \\"Maybe they should save soon.\\" It's a simple point A to point B which can bring out point C, kind of like the regular jokes in Family Guy.<br /><br />One major setback is the total waste of Sean Bean's performance. His side story involves him looking for his wife, Rose, and the result is something interesting yet highly unnecessary. Instead, Avary should have stuck with the game's original design and kept the lead a male. Bean's the better of any actor attached to the film and is yet swept unnoticed. The film would have worked inordinately better with him in the starring role. Instead, the film borrows from any modern day horror film and features the distraught female lead with the creepy child that loves to draw fast (e.g. The Ring, The Ring 2, The Amityville Horror 2005, Dark Water, The Grudge, etc.).<br /><br />In areas where the film works, the storyline disrupts - so much so that you literally wonder when it will end. It starts out fresh and then somewhere around the middle, when dozens of Puritans ruin the isolated feeling of the picture, the film takes a nosedive. This is when Isuggest that you walk out satisfied rather than confused and bored.<br /><br />Gans and Avary were close with this, so close that it's probably the best video game adaptation to date. Nevertheless, with plot holes and an abundance of unnecessary plot or character angles, the film fizzles flat. I suggest spending 10 bucks and buying the original game, turning off the lights, and playing it while you're sleepy.sedive.

1593973594|3.0|Digital Fortress, the CD, was narrated by Bruce Sabath.  Since I haven't read the unabridged version (and haven't read any other reviews of the abridged version), I can't comment whether the editors make a so-so story better or worse by cutting it down.  In the abridged version, perhaps the unbelievable occurrences were tempered by the interest I had in the workings (real or imagined) of the ultra-secret NSA and the code-breakers.<br /><br />I wasn't really impressed by the voices of Bruce Sabath.  Perhaps he is good for other books, but he was distracting in this one.<br /><br />And did I imagine it, or did Susan's fiance, trying to use the restroom in an airport in Spain, finding the men's room closed and using the \\"Dames,\\" use the urinal (???).<br /><br />This was not a Da Vinci Code (which is good as a CD book).  The short-term entertainment value of Digital Fortress was above average, but it will soon be forgotten.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|I attended this concert at Denver Colorado's Mile High and at Dallas Texas Super Dome. These were excellent concerts and the DVD captures the quality performance of this tour. Dave Gilmour brought this together very well without Roger Waters; whom I am also a great fan. The audio and video are stimulating and is well worth the money and the long wait. I would have given this DVD a five star rating but that rating goes to Floyds 1987 concert 'Delicate Sound of Thunder', which I also attended at Kansas City's Arrowhead stadium. The intensity and arrangment of this show surpases Pulse and the performance of 'The Great Gig in the Sky' still gives me a pleasent shiver when I play the VHS. Personally I like Momentary Lapse of Reason music more than Pulse.  The Delicate performance did have a higher energy level. I own both on VHS and was very pleased to purchase Pulse on DVD to add to my collection. If you like this concert you owe it to yourself to view DSOT. All in all, Pulse is a very, very good concert video and most buyers will not be disappointed.

0743454537|1.0|Jodi Picoult, My Sister's Keeper (Washington Square Press, 2004)<br /><br />Did you ever start off reading a book with a relatively high opinion of it, and then have that opinion spiral downward every few pages until it just bottomed out at the end? That's how I felt while reading My Sister's Keeper.<br /><br />Picoult has a great hook-- a child, conceived for the purpose of keeping her leukemic older sister alive, sues her parents for medical emancipation-- and she starts out defining her characters well, giving us a stable of interesting people about whom to read. It all, however, goes downhill from there. Picoult has that rare and undesirable combination of a taste for melodrama and a fine ear for clich&eacute;, and it's so well-mixed that even the quotes she chooses at the beginnings of sections are fraught with both. (When you see Milton's long-trampled quote about darkness visible in a book, what's going to happen? Yes, you know.) At over four hundred pages, the writing style just wears you down. Then characters start to slip from three-dimensional model into two-dimensional archetype, and either Picoult's own prejudices, or her attempts to manipulate the reader, start to show through. The rise of this trait and the rise of the melodrama, not surprisingly, go hand in hand. As the characters get less and less three-dimensional, they get more grating. This is especially true in the case of Sara, the mother involved; by page three hundred, I was marveling that no other character in the novel had simply killed her in her sleep to put her out of everyone else's misery.<br /><br />And then comes the ending. Holy cow, the awful, horrible, cheesy, syrupy, lowest-common-denominator, you could see it coming from so far away because it was as big as Jupiter's great red spot, Lifetime Original Movie(TM) ending. It was like a punch in the stomach to have come this far with these characters and then have the author take the path of least resistance. If you read this book, when you get to page 350 or thereabouts, stop, take a bunch of index cards, and write down all the possible ways you think this book might end. Rank them in terms of desirability. I guarantee that the end of this book will be the one you put at the absolute bottom of the stack. It's THAT bad.<br /><br />I probably should have waited a few days to write this review in order to mellow over the awfulness of the ending, but the simple truth is, the book doesn't deserve any mellowing out. The author pulled a cheap shot. There's no reason the reviewer shouldn't as well. It starts out a relatively decent book. By its end, it is unbearably awful.

B000BTJDGC|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />\\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" approaches its subject matter with a bit more intelligence and thought than we are used to in films of this type.  The movie, in fact, is more of a courtroom drama with supernatural elements than a flat-out horror film in its own right.<br /><br />Based on a true story, the film begins with the death of a 19-year-old girl from what appears to be a botched exorcism.  The priest in charge of the ritual, Father Moore, is arrested and put on trial for negligent homicide.  Erin Bruner, a self-described \\"woman of doubt,\\" is the attorney hired by the Catholic archdiocese to defend the case.  At first, Bruner is skeptical of Father Moore's story of what happened to the girl, but after she herself begins to experience strange, unexplainable phenomena in her own life, she comes to believe that there just might be a plausible supernatural explanation for the death.<br /><br />Eschewing most of the over-the-top silliness usually associated with demon-possession scenarios, \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" prefers, instead, to concentrate on the running battle between science and rationality on one side and religion and faith on the other that has become a commonplace in our more enlightened modern times.  Although the movie clearly sides with the supernatural explanation, it still leaves room for the more skeptical among us to have their say.  The dialogue is generally sharp, insightful and thought provoking and the screenplay treats the spokespersons from both sides of the argument with dignity and respect.<br /><br />Although this film is set in the rural Midwest, the actual \\"Emily Rose\\" was a German girl named Anneliese Michel who died in 1976 and whose grave in Germany has since become a pilgrimage site for believers convinced that she was indeed possessed by Satan.<br /><br />The real focus of the film, however, is on the lawyer, Bruner, who undergoes a spiritual reassessment as a result of her involvement in the case.  Laura Linney, as always, brings a seriousness and intelligence to her role of a woman who has her entire view of the world and how it works irrevocably shaken up and altered by the experience.<br /><br />Diehard horror film fans may be disappointed by the relatively short shrift given to the possession sequences, which are seen only in flashbacks and, which, despite their commendable restraint, often have the feel of a warmed-over \\"Exorcist\\" about them (although that is practically inevitable with any movie on this subject at this point, I would imagine).  However, it is as a courtroom drama that the film scores most of its hits, and those of us who have watched with dismay the steady degeneration of the horror movie genre of late are quick to welcome this approach.nd intelligence to her role of a woman who has her entire view of the world and how it works irrevocably shaken up and altered by the experience.

B000001FKY|5.0|I love Def Leppard. They were the sound of the 1980s. They were regular perfomers on MTV during the 1980s. They not only made videos but they made music history. I was watching the movie based on the group's beginnings and the troubles. The fact that the drummer plays with only one arm after a tragic car accident shows the band's determination in returning to the concert halls as Def Leppard. The boys from Sheffield, South Yorkshire were just ordinary boys who wanted to form a band. This album with their first hit, Pour Some Sugar On Me, played endless and countless times on MTV. I won't forget the other songs like Hysteria, Love Bites, Armageddon, and I think this collection showed that Def Leppard was back and better than ever. They matured and grew and suffered some setbacks. They lived during the period of sex, drugs, and music. It's still music today. It's classic. I think of Def Leppard as one of the greatest music bands in British history. I would love to seem them all honored with the British honor like an MBE just like the Beverley Sisters or as long as they get honored as a group would be thrilling. I wish their fans would nominate them. If I could nominate everybody I thought would get it, it would be too much for me. I pray the fans would find a way that they all can get to the palace.
0312330537|5.0|I just finished reading this book and it was, by far, one of the best books I've ever read.  It took me awhile to finish the last 100 pages because I didn't want it to end.  I became so immersed in the world of Lin and the wonderful characters and I now would love to visit Bombay.  Gregory David Roberts has a beautiful writing style.  This is a very long book but fast reading and totally engrossing from beginning to end. <br /> <br />Prabaker was one of the most entertaining, warm and loving people I've come across in a novel.  And Mr.Roberts, himself, is amazing.  This is one man I'd love to meet.  Even though he was a criminal, he came across as so loyal, honest, intelligent and philosophical.  I can't wait for the movie to come out in 2008 so that hopefully we will get to see him on talk shows.  I have no clue how this book will be translated into a 2 hour movie, though.  It's more suited for a week-long mini-series.  Too much happening for a 2 hour movie. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to everyone.  I found myself rereading lines and paragraphs which were written so beautifully and reading out loud lines that were so funny, especially those from Prabaker.  Fabulous book!  Amazing author!
1594200440|1.0|Marina Lewycka, A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian (Penguin, 2005)<br /><br />I guess it had to happen sometime. It's true: I am officially the first person on the entire planet who has read A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian and not been thoroughly captivated by it. In fact, in most years, it would have easily run away with the title of \\"dullest book I've read this year.\\" (Unfortunately, I also chose 2006 to be the year I attempted Piers Anthony.)<br /><br />This would have made a pretty amusing short story-- an old man sets out to marry a much younger woman who's obviously only out for legal immigration status for her and her son, and his two daughters-- both of them older than their prospective stepmother-- set out to gum up the works. All well and good, and it would have probably worked for fifty pages. But for three hundred? It's a one-trick pony, and it quickly falls into the trap of being episodic, degenerating to the level of a sitcom, and not a very good one. The book within the novel, which is the Short History of the title (being written by the father in question), is far more interesting then the story itself. That's saying something. (zero)

I just want to remember a better time in my life when it seemed easier than it is now. Maybe life has become more stressful as we got older or maybe we just appreciate the past a bit more than we ever did before.
B00006M183|5.0|I just refreshed my ears listening to \\"Riot\\" again! Getting to to hear 1/2 Full, which clocking in at just over 4 minutes, is sheer electric blues magic. The price of this album is worth this one rocker alone.<br /><br />It was nice to see it on \\"Easy Street\\" (along with Lukin' Excellent!)any way this number totally kicks!  Definitely get this if you don't already own it.
1402541791|4.0|This is the third in a series, so do start with the first \\"The Number 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\".  As soon as you hear the lovely, evocative voice of the narrator, you'll be transported to the faraway country of Botswana among its (generally) peaceful, gentle, intelligent, and humorous people in their individual and often complicated lives.  No need to actually buy a plane ticket..just sit back and listen to these beautiful stories which are beautifully performed.
6305882592|5.0|Prior to VHS or DVD - back in 1971-75 - when movie theaters (remember those, the ones where it was only $1 for two films and a short and the films were shown in BIG theaters - so what if the sound wasn't Dolby or DTS - films were still films not; just 1 of 10 stock plots enhanced by computer special effects. <br /> <br />Well, this film was so absolutely brilliant and profound, innocent and ageless that I saw it every time it was advertised \\"in the newspaper\\" - in the movie section.  I believe I lost count at around 75 - now with the DVD in my closet it just is not watched as mcuh but remains for times when it is necessary to remember that people are really alive and giving souls - whether they represent the protagonist or antagonist. <br /> <br />\\"Give me an \\"L\\"; give me an \\"I\\"; give me a \\"V\\"; give me an  \\"E\\";  L I V E,  live!

B00007AJF9|4.0|The intent of the director was to capture the ATMOSPHERE or \\"flavor\\" of the Elizabethan court. Intrigue, alliances, deceit, ambitions, trechery and emotions. In addition he means to show us that Elizabeth was a human being thrust into power, and all that power demands. An innocent among the wolves. On those points he got it right ALTHOUGH people were not quite as clean and good looking then. Times were brutal. A toothache could kill you. Lice were everywhere.      Those who criticize on historical accuracy complaints miss the point. An historically accurate film would span very very many hours or even more.    The movie probably could have been a little longer as it is. Worthy of multiple viewings.    Geoffrey Rush in a standout performance as Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's shadowy, street smart but patriotic ally who moves mountains for her with extreme ruthlessness from behind curtains. His performance alone makes this worth viewing.
0143036742|1.0|Why is it that everyone raves about this novel? Is it the exoticism of Ukrainian lifestyle and manners that tickles people? It is, quite simply, a badly written book which isn't particularly interesting. More like a poor script for a daytime sitcom. So if you like that kind of thing, by all means buy. If you're looking for a good novel - avoid.
B00006LJ6X|4.0|As several people have said, this was the last interesting Chicago album (unless you like the sappy ballads that made them so much cash during the 80s). At its best, this album is really exciting and fresh. The instrumental music holds up better than most of the jazz/rock fusion of the 70s, and the pop songs are among their strongest. On the negative side, there are, as on most double albums, two or three weak songs. The other negative is that, in listening to the pop songs--even the good ones--you can hear the direction they were headed in. No more experimentation, no more fun. Maybe it was unrealistic to think a band could continue being this schizophrenic.
B000002L9J|5.0|A Queen on her deathbed is a symbol of a countries fall. On the cover of The Smith's \\"The Queen is Dead,\\" a dark, almost gothic picture of a portrait of a dead person with their arms crossed stretched out in blackness, gives off a morbid feeling. At first glance it might look like a typical metal, maybe even gothic album, but the music contained inside is some of the best college-pop rock that can be heard, equal to much of The Beatles body of work, in both the emotion that the song's convey, and the amount of detail and poetry behind the lyrics and soundscapes. Sadly, pop rock is too often concerned more with pretty front men/woman, superficial hooks, and much else that makes it lose credibility. The Smiths, however, turn the normal conventions around, and make the songs phenomenal, with an altogether prestigious substance in their music. As, quite simply, this is masterful stuff, and The Smith's seemed to be wearing rockets attached to their boots to send them up and away to greater things; if that were even possible after this pedestal.     Singer/ Songwriter Morrissey often croons with an irregular, soft, intimate, and delightful voice; containing a small punkish feel in its personality. The Smiths intentions are apparent from the onset, with the first song, The Queen is Dead, starting out alike a pub song, and then moving into a political tirade with a satiric sense of humor. The song also utilizes Morrissey's impressive sense of song structure, beat in vocals, and rhythm, all created with musical composer/guitarist Johnny Marr's steady, restrained, and low-key backbeat. This acute precision of voice and lyrics, beat and tempo, with the poignant, yet held back and perfectly placed instrumentals, make \\"The Smiths`\\" sound razzle-dazzle, serpentinely moving between allegories, memories, emotional passages, and a mesh of fitly knit love songs. Through this annalistically composed music, keen hooks, and Morrissey's efficient bellow, the album is brought forthright with this vast army of stunningly written singles. The Queen is Dead is partly comprised of the self-mockery of Cemetery Gates, the gloomy Bigmouth Strikes Again, and the religious poke, Vicar in a Tutu; songs that sit nicely next to the masterpieces, such as, Frankly, Mr. Shankly, The Boy with the Thorn in His Side, and especially, There is a Light that Never Goes Out, as well as the aforementioned, album-title track, The Queen is Dead.     The album is grand because it transcends the formulas. The hooks are in place, yes, but at the same time they do not cry for attention, or really make up the soul of the song; instead they sit nicely inside it, only coming out when necessary. The music is always apparent, and is carefully embedded into the songs, not the other way around, thus letting the poetic lyrics shine through. Poetic lyricism is at its strongest here, as Morrissey's grasp on his refrain is exceptional. Through mostly free verse, he wrote songs that could just as well be read at a poetry reading, and be just as good. With passages speaking of his dream to be a musician, and his disgruntled views on his, \\"Bloody awful\\" poetry writing, and \\"Pain in the arse\\" boss (from Frankly, Mr. Shankley,) to The Boy with the Thorn in His Side, about a lonely young man, who dreams of passion; Morrissey works many themes of self-expression into the equation. He even adds some humor, like on, There is a Light That Never Goes Out, a song about love with rather humorous Romeo-and- Juliet lyrics, like,\\" And if a double-decker bus, crashes into us/ to die by your side/ such a heavenly way to die.\\"       In the end, words cannot utterly describe the amount of nostalgia, heartache, and passion inside The Smiths music; because, \\"The Queen is Dead\\" is a pedestal of which all college-pop rock should be weighted, and is a blistering, infectious, and dizzily-awe inspiring masterpiece of the form.       ***** (Out of 5)

B000HA4WTI|1.0|I mean, nothing made sense in this movie and it literally made my head spin. Nothing but fast cars, severly underweight h00chies, and plenty of rock/hip&hop music. It was like watching an extremely long music video. Sean is supposed to be in high school, but as old as he looked I guess he was on the 10 year plan. On top of that, he talked like Forrest Gump. In order not to go to jail, Sean moves to Japan to live with his dad. Sean was able to find himself a crew real quick. And if he and his friends were suppposedly in high school, how come they had so much time to race, fix cars, and go to parties? Shouldn't they have been studying for entrance crams? If it wasn't for Bow Wow and Vin Diesel (small part at the end), I never would've watched this waste of a film.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|At last, there is a film worthy of DC Comics' second great superhero.  When Tim Burton's 1989 film came out, I was very impressed, and enjoyed the film immensely (even if I never was completely sold on Michael Keaton as Batman).  I remember leaving the theater thinking it was a really good film, but disappointed that it didn't prove to be as stirring as \\"Superman: the Movie\\" had been in 1978.  It's interesting how the passage of the years, and the appearance of numerous other superhero pictures, has affected my perception of both films.  Even if the special effects are a little dated, Richard Donner's Superman film remains a powerful, thrilling, entertaining movie, and is still the definitive movie treatment of the character.  Burton's Batman, however, has not aged so well.  In fact, after recently watching my old VHS copy of Burton's movie, I wonder what I ever really saw in it.  The gothic/art deco Gotham seen in the film is a visual feast, but comes off seeming a bit too much.  Keaton is physically just all wrong for the part, and while he acts the part of Batman well enough, his Bruce Wayne seems like a clueless, socially inept geek, not a billionaire playboy.  Most of the supporting characters (Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, et al.) are unmemorable.  And finally, the focus seems to be more on the villian (the Joker) than on the title character (indeed, this was a problem with all the four films in this series).  When I recently re-watched Burton's take on the character, I found the Batman looking inexcusably hokey in his first onscreen appearance, a rooftop fight with a couple of muggers.  He doesn't look scary at all, and when he walks toward the muggers \\"flapping\\" his cape downward once like wings, it looks so ridiculous that you just can't buy the reaction of one of the crooks a few moments later when he wails: \\"what are you?\\"  You just can't believe a hardened thug would be so frightened of what is obviously just a guy in a weird-looking rubber suit.<br /><br />Fortunately for Batman fans, Christopher Nolan does it much, much better.  He clearly took a page from Donner's book, making this an origin story that doesn't give us a look at the character in his superhero guise until halfway into the picture.  And like the 1978 Superman movie, the story of the character's journey is told so well you don't mind waiting that long.  Moreover, when the hero does appear, the wait is well worth it.  This Batman, unlike Burton's/Keaton's, is actually scary and menacing.  He stays in the shadows, taking out criminals without ever giving them a good look at him.  Christian Bale is far better for role physically than Keaton was, and makes a much more imposing figure.  Not only does Bale make a better Batman, he makes a superior Bruce Wayne.  He portrays the real Bruce Wayne in his scenes with Alfred and Rachel, and the Bertie Wooster playboy Wayne becomes for the public, making him far more true to the comic book character, and also giving him far more depth than Keaton's maladjusted geek, or Val Kilmer's angst-ridden nice guy (I won't even go into George Clooney's attempt to put a stake through the heart of the character).  The supporting characters are much more interesting than in Burton's film, as well.  I was leery of a cockney Alfred, but Michael Caine does an outstanding job, and you can really see how Bruce Wayne would see him as a father figure, not just as the hired help.  Gary Oldman is superb as Commissioner-to-be Gordon (he's just a sergeant here).  And Morgan Freeman is great as Lucius Fox.  Katie Holmes is the only weak link in the cast, but she's not so bad as to hurt the film.  I really hope they can follow this movie up with sequels that are worthy of it.  Bad sequels killed Christopher Reeve's Superman franchise, and Batman was already sliding downhill when Joel Schumacher made his 1997 abortion with George Clooney - film so staggeringly bad it might easily have put an end to Batman on film for all time.  Fortunately,Christopher Nolan rescued a great and enduring character from the hands of those who almost destroyed him.  For that he is to be congratulated.y, Christopher Nolan rescued a great and enduring character from the hands of those who almost destroyed him.  For that he is to be congratulated.
B00004YRQA|4.0|I can't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars.  You are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one, but unfortunately, if you live in the country like me, finding a store nearby selling Playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible.  So you're forced to shop for one online. <br /> <br />It's REALLY not cool to have to pay all this money *just* to save the progress in my video game.  It's really dumb.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|Citizen Kane this is not, but it's still a very entertaining, action packed, thrill ride with great special effects, decent characters, and a pretty good story.  I notice that most of the negative reviews are from comics fans who can't stand how their favorite characters were treated in this movie.  Well, this is the movie, not the comic series.  And this manages to be a very entertaining film.  It has its flaws, such as Storm inexplicably losing the accent she had for the first two movies, and the occasional bit of cheesy dialogue, but it's good entertainment, and people who are not dead set on having the comic characters exactly represented on screen will not find much to complain about.
0385720920|4.0|Great book. Classic Chuck Palahniuk at his best.  His post-modern, cynical world-view will have you thinking the strangest thoughts while reading this winner.
0060934913|1.0|Rairly have I read a book that I hate.  This is it!  Not only is it not funny but it is insulting to anyone who would sit in his dining room.  Tony's fan base just lost one.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|I've been a big fan of Amon Amarth for a couple years now, but this album is by far their best work yet. Every track is just amazing. <br /> <br />The recording seems more refined and \\"clean\\" than their previous albums (its much easier to hear each instrument and each tone, beat and word), while the music is still extremely complex. Most importantly it sounds excellent. Every track is memorable. <br /> <br />My favorites are Asator, Valhall Awaits Me and Runes to My Memory, but the whole CD is every bit as good. <br /> <br />I'm not into all kinds of death metal (not really into Cannibal Corpse or Deicide or other bands like that) but this band is phenomenal. Their music is organized and complex and the vocalist can put out some of the best growls and screams in metal while still being totaly clear. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album to fans of any kind of metal... even if you dont normally listen to death metal, give this a try. You wont regret it.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I can't add much more to what everyone else has already said except to say that I totally love this film, and it is  one of the best comic/superhero films of all time, much less the BEST silver-screen representation of Batman. None of the other films can even touch this one.  <br /> <br />When I heard that Christopher Nolan was making this, I had hopes that it would be a quality film. I was equally intriqued when they cast Christian Bale. They understood that an actor has to be convincing as Bruce Wayne AND Batman, and Bale is an inspired choice. I read that they wanted to make a great, timeless adventure movie (as in Star Wars, the original, and Indiana Jones) with this, and they have. You have lots of great stuff going on here, archetypal characters such as Liam Niesan's Obe Wan Kinobe-type teacher character. They also finally get Batman's origin correct, and no, the Joker didn't kill Bruce's parents, as in the original film. The scene where Lt. Gordon is comforting a young Bruce after his parent's murder is really emotionally charged. Great casting, great attention to details all around. This isn't someone's interpretation of the source material, this IS the source material, collectively on film, and it even enhances the source material (as there is no one true definitive ORIGIN story for Batman because DC Comics rejiggers their continuity all the time). <br /> <br />Also, we finally get to see The Scarecrow, one of my favorite villians, on screen for the very first time in live action. And luckily the filmmakers understood that he should actually be scary, and not silly looking, as his schtick is fear.  <br /> <br />Really, this is what Batman is supposed to be. Not a bunch of gadgets, neon, camp, and silliness. This is more believable. I really hope that they can keep up this momentum for the next film, The Dark Knight.
B00004NJJQ|5.0|The guitar work of Michael Schenker certainly deserves all the praise it receives in these reviews, but UFO was a band and this was definitely a group effort. UFO had soul (something that separates \\"hard rock\\" from \\"metal\\", in my opinion), and with the songwriting of Phil Mogg and Pete Way, you got a variety of themes and emotions expressed through the songs. Mogg does not have the most dynamic vocal abilities, but what he does, he does very well. The faster, rocking tunes have just the right edge to them, and his ballads have a haunting, hypnotic quality to them. \\"Crystal Light\\" is one example, that always felt like a rock and roll sea shanty, to me. He also does a great job on the cover of the old blues tune, \\"Built for Comfort\\". One thing I absolutely agree with is that they were far underrated and should have gotten far more notoriety. So if you want \\"in\\" on the secret, give it a listen!  **One thing to look out for: if you get the remastered version in the \\"Classic Rock Series,\\" they messed up the track order! \\"Oh My\\" was not the first song on the LP (at least not the one I own.) If you want to experience the album the way UFO intended, look up a UFO discography and reprogram your player to get the tracks in the right order!
B000B5XOSO|3.0|Lots of people hate this film. Reviewers online claim it is \\"A Tim Burton film with Tim Burton characters that just happens to have the Batman name on it\\". That's harsh, but I can see where the strong sentiment comes from. Burton, in the last film, had Joker kill Batman's parents (didn't happen that way). In this one, he further warps the comic continuity by making the Penguin a sewer-dwelling freak. I think the Penguin works best when he is a ruthless gangster and businessman, as in the comic, and not a deformed individual, but just a short and portly top hat and monacle-wearing high-class crook. I'm sure Christopher Nolan will address this fact in his next Batman sequel. In this film, the Penguin is highly unlikable and repulsive, but somehow rises to a kind of \\"Elephant Man\\" acceptance in high society and, improbably, makes a bid for political office (which is foiled by Batman via a bat-gadget in one of the singular most lame and embarassing scenes of the film).  <br /> <br />Michelle Pfeiffer's HOT turn as Catwoman is what saves this film, and I think she is bar none the best actress to don the cat's black tights in all of Bat-history (sorry, Halle). The tension between her and Batman's alter egos is pretty enjoyable. I think as a character and villian, she works. Christopher Walken is just distracting with ridiculous white hair, in a reworked role that was originally written for the character Harvey Dent/ Two Face (to be played by Billy Dee Williams? How would THAT have turned out???).  As far as the title character (who is constantly overshadowed by all this other stuff)? Keaton is solid just like the previous film, but there's still far too much reliance on gadgets, making Batman seem like a James Bond clone. Putting these flaws aside, Batman Returns has to be one of the most bizarre major studio, summer blockbusters ever made (the film takes place during Christmas, for one thing). You have to put aside what Batman is supposed to be like, and just succumb toBurton's dark and zany vision. It sure beats the next two films in the series.
B000002UEB|5.0|A progressive metal/rock masterpiece. As is frequently cited in the reviews, this is perhaps the ultimate rock concept album of all time. There had been concept albums before this, but none that did what this album does. That is weave one continuous story seamlessly into each and every song on the album. This is what I found most startling upon first listening to it (back in 1988) - that I was being thrown into a story in which each successive song expounded on it. Equally startling are the fluid instrumental transitions from song to song which are nothing short of perfect - a credit to Queensryche's exceptional musicianship and Michael Kamen's masterful orchestration.    The album tells the story of a character, Nikki, who has been caught up in a shadowy underground movement in which he is an assassin. The plot involves a mysterious leader named Doctor X, Nikki's priest Father William, and Sister Mary, a former whore turned Nun (she was saved by Father William.) who shares an unspoken love with Nikki. The story plays out in a dystopian vision that is the landscape of a 1980's Reagan America.    The songs range from hard rocking radio/video friendly types to ambitious long operatic overtures. The instrumental work on the songs is incredible. With soaring guitar arpeggios often flowing into melodious transitions. Geoff Tate excels with his soaring operatic tenor and guest vocalist Pamela Moore is a fantastic foil to Tate's tenor on the ambitious Suite Sister Mary, the ten and one-half minute crescendo in the middle of the story.    At times, the album's political and social commentary can be overly ambitious, but for the most part - Queensryche pulls it off. This is their crowning achievement. (It allows me to forgive and forget the commercial cash-in Empire that succeeded this.)    In short, Operation Mindcrime is a must have for any music lover and serious audiophile. It is a landmark album and the concept album on which other concept albums will be judged for a long time to come.
0790731002|1.0|Where to start? The villian Two Face is wasted in a characterization that has virtually NOTHING to do with the comic equivalent (he's not supposed to be colorful and over the top, cracking stupid one-liners--never has, never will be).  Jim Carrey is irritatingly manic as the Riddler, almost as if he was trying to out-Joker Nicholson. But Carrey's role is one of the high points of the film!! (if they hadn't made him a stupid mad scientist and Carrey had taken it down just ONE notch, it could've been great). Kilmer is neither good nor bad as Batman/Bruce Wayne, he's just there (incidentally I remember reading somewhere that Kilmer's turn was called the best casting of Bruce Wayne ever seen on screen by Batman creator Bob Kane).  <br /> <br />Can I say anything good about this film? The redesigned batmobile looks kinda \\"kewl\\"---until it drives up the side of a building.  <br /> <br />The franchise probably needed a change following Tim Burton's overly dark and uncharacteristic films; this is a berserk 180 degree turn from the world of Burton into the world of Schumacher: into neon, sillyness, camp, crotch-shots, 60's TV-styled Batman, and leads the way to \\"Batman And Robin\\", the most maligned and probably the most abysmal comic-book film of all time. Until the mighty and much-welcomed \\"Batman Begins\\" restart years later, it's all downhill from here for movie Bats.

B000HCO83Q|3.0|How much does a director really influence a film? Bryan Singer bailed on the X-Men franchise (to make the underwhelming Superman Returns), and fans collectively howled at the hiring of Brett Ratner to helm this pivotal installment. But it's really NOT THAT BAD of a film. I will state three small problems with the film; SPOILERS GALORE, people! <br /> <br />1 From the beginning, it's a tease. We have the X-gang in the danger room. Cool. We even have Colossus launch Wolverine for a \\"fastball special\\". Right out of the comic, cool. At what is he being launched? A light that's attacking them. He then scissors off and throws down a Sentinel's head, all off camera. So once again, we don't get to see the Sentinels in an X-Men film. Probably too costly to bring to the screen, or it was either them or the Golden Gate Bridge scene. <br /> <br />2 Some characters have virtually nothing to do, like Rogue. Some characters are introduced to merely move the story along, like Angel. And one major character is killed offscreen, inexplicably. That major character deserved WAYYY better than that.  <br /> <br />3 Some of the acting is plain hammy, even for these movies. Even the usually reliable Hugh Jackman has some shaky moments. I realize, it's comic book derived material, not Shakespeare. But maybe the bad acting signals Ratner's directing influence, maybe not.  <br /> <br />Things I did like about this film: the characters they added just plain rock! Kelsey Grammar as Beast, Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, and a cute new actress playing Kitty / Shadowcat. It's good casting all around. And the script is really over the top, overstuffed with action and plot. There's something going on at almost all times, unlike the ponderous quality of Singer's X-Men, and the special effects are eye popping. And there are many great memorable moments (Iceman Vs. Pyro, Kitty Vs. Juggernaut, Mystique: cured and naked). What I don't understand is why they were bent on making this the last one--maybe theythought it was too expensive or logisically difficult to get this massive cast together. Hopefully they make more X-films, as this one was a box office smash. Keep them coming, keep up the quality, and the fans will be there.
B000GYI32M|5.0|I would have to say that i am a HUGE fan of the OC and have followd it from day one.  I loved the third season more then any of the other seasons.  I am just dissapointed that they killed off Marissa.  Im also very sad at the fact that there will be only one more season left.  I LOVE the show and own all the sesons.  Hopefully something else will come out just like this but im sure it wont top the OC.

031286504X|3.0|The book is well written but never delivers the punch it tries to build. It borders on 'who cares?' as it drags and drags on. The new generation of readers will not get the stuggle of a man living in a futuristic 70's though wriiten in the 50's. Its supposed to take place in the seventies which it clearly is not.<br />The story embarks the life of a lonely man living in his home. He is the last man alive not infected or last man alive around his neighborhood, we think. During the day, he fixes his house or goes out for provisions. He is stalked at night by vampires so he is imprisoned at sun down. All the vampires do is wait outside his home like pigeons waiting to be feed which never happens. The vampires are written to be dumb, so not Lestat or any vampire character (i.e. Blade) of today. Instead they are more of a mob and never problem solving. More like zombies.. The protagonist spends all his nights dreading his life and usually ends up getting drunk. BORING!<br />The twists are predictable and not that climatic. The book is only a few hundred pages. SO much better out there. A book past its generation if ya will.
034544678X|5.0|I really like this book.  She gives many descriptions on her dogs and their various personalities.  She discusses the differences between humans and dogs also.  I enjoyed the stories regarding the dogs that she had and their interactions towards each other.  It helped me to understand the beauty of animals and that they are not stupid at all!

0618680004|3.0|Dawkins can be witty, and he can sometimes forge the truth, but this book went overboard.  There's no need for the God Delusion, it's more the religion delusion, and they are not one in the same. We are a global culture caught up in definitions, and Dawkins doesn't help. Our highest self is whatever you call it, but not the institution that defines it.  While reading, \\"Forget The Cures, Find The Cause,\\" I found myself erasing the definitions and abandoning the religion, so I could get back to the truth. The \\"psychotic\\" verbage in one review may be true, and I believe Dawkins needs to regroup and find his center.
B000H7JD4K|2.0|Realmente estaba algo pesimista con el nuevo disco de Iron Maiden, cuando escucho \\"Benjamin Breeg\\" y \\"Different world\\", me parece que no había ninguna innovacion, en realidad, este disco es mas de lo mismo en los ultimos 6 años. No quiero decir que es patetico, simplemente creo que estan en la direccion incorrecta.  La falta de ideas musicales, creativas, el exceso de tener discos demasiados largos, tener introducciones y finales muy identicas, canciones a momentos exageradamente largas y esquemas muy parecidos, llega a ser este disco un sonido monotono y por momentos, aburrido. Lo bueno, es que la voz de Dickinson sigue como siempre espectacular, sin embargo la falta de creatividad del resto del grupo es lamentable.  Al final, el Iron Maiden de hoy, es un sonido que a muchos les gusta y a otros no (que es mi caso). Pero tampoco quiero decir que vuelvan a las raices; pero tiene que renovarse y sacar muy buenos discos y no quedarse pegado con \\"Brave new world\\" en adelante. Los unicos temas destacados son el brillante \\"The legacy\\", \\"These colours don´t run\\" y el mismo \\"The reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\", pero el resto de los temas, llega al aburrimiento y quizas apagar el disco o saltar a otras canciones.

B000E1MTY0|5.0|I agree with the rest that if you have an HD DVD player this is your must own HD title.  While Aeon Flux is still thought to be the one that takes HD full capacity visually, Batman Begins does just that but also with AUDIO.  The true lossless HD alone is worth having this.<br /><br />But I have to say, personally, while it's a visually stunning film, it does what it can for such a dark and flat film.  We understand that's part of the story but in terms of visuals it WOWed me but not by much.  I'm sure once we get something more vibrant and colourful with TrueHD sound we'll regard that as the must have title for your HD player. But for now Batman will surely do.<br /><br />As for the story, well I'm sure most of us already know what it's about and already have it on SD DVD so I'll spare you the details =)
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Firstly Avril Lavigne has done a great job, lets face it, anyone who can do something completely un-natural to themselves, and earn millions is a genius.<br /><br />I understand she was a country and western singer before her producer told her, 'look the best way to earn millions is to become a completely fake bimbo with the wrong label, but the right audience', or something like that anyway, then she replied, 'no, I love my country singing, please, please,' then, 'Enough! You shall be a punk rock star who sings about skater boys, OK?', 'I suppose so,' I'm not sure if thats 100% accurate, but I heard it through the 'punk rock' grapevine. So, here we are, with yet another talentless person making WAY TOO MUCH MONEY.<br /><br />Just another manufactured suburban lil gal.
B00007AJF9|2.0|This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto \\"Semper Eadem\\", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he portrayed was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history.

0553383663|4.0|Google is nowadays known by a large percentage of people surfing the web. Surveys usually put Google as the first search engine in the world (before other Yahoo!, MSN and Ask Jeeves). Two journalists, D. Vise and M. Malseed, tell the whole Google story from its very beginning (even before Google starts in 1998). Their book tells you the story of Google from several points of views. They skip from search engine to financial as well as human ressource point of views. This gives to my mind a good overall view of Google as a whole. I will summarize by saying that this book is for you if you:<br /><br />  * Know Google and want to know more about it<br /><br />  * Want to have an overall view of Google with no technical concepts<br /><br />  * Like well writen success stories<br /><br />However, this book is perhaps not for you if you:<br /><br />  * Want technical details about Google<br /><br />  * Are interested in the dark side of Google<br /><br />  * Need a 100% objective view on this search engine<br /><br />Finally, I found this book very well writen and also interesting. The only drawback is the sometimes subjective point of view of the writers. They use Google and they like it, therefore it's pretty difficult to give an objective mind about it.
B0009WFF7M|3.0|I've owned this on cassette (lost), then vinyl (worn useless) and now CD.  I have to say that while it's nice to own this great work of art on a medium that won't get worn easily, don't buy it for the 5.1 mix.  I was so dissapointed to hear all this remixing and remastering in 24-bit 96KHz audio was wasted on the dolby digital format, the absolute worst surround sound format ever invented.  The gurgly watery sound of dolby digital ruins all potential this mix had.  Not only that but I find the mix to be painfully compressed.  Everytime there's a drum hit, the volume of everything drops then slowly creeps back to the original volume.  All the pumping and breathing of the heavy compression is the kind of mistake a first year audio engineer would make and ruins what little potential that was left by the horrible dolby digital encoding.  I was only able to listen to part of 3 songs before I decided I'll never listen to the surround mix again.  I'd rather hear good stereo than bad surround. <br />On the positive side, the 24-bit 48KHz PCM version has all the life and beauty of the original mix.  Dynamic and vibrant.  It's just a pity they couldn't recreate that mix using modern technology as digital conversion is a lot better than it was 20 years ago.  There's still remnants of the cold brittle sound of old digital technology that plagued the album originally but I'd say the new 24-bit master is slightly better than the original 16-bit. <br /> <br />Overall, it's still a fantactic album that stands on its own today and it's worth owning, just don't waste your time with the surround portion.
1593352816|2.0|I agree with a lot of the reviews of the written format, and I will note that the reader did an excellent job.  It does draw you right in and the characters, including the dog, are well-drawn and very believable.  But the story required a real suspension of disbelief.  Note, the easiest to believe is that these creatures have been genetically altered.  I had no problem going with the dog that can essentially type messages in good English.  No problem there!  What I couldn't believe was that the author of these intricate complex stories can't seem to get past his California state boundaries.  The hero is concerned that  he can't fly this dog without a vaccination record--true, but then he and the female lead get forged ID's but can't print a fake vaccination record off any old computer in town!  Then they have to drive away from the hitman and the other creature who has it in for the dog and can \\"sense\\" him when the two get within miles of each other.  Oh, dear, oh, dear!  We can't fly so we have to drive--all the way to Big Sur!!!  No one seems to think about driving across several states and getting FAR away.  No, this is where I lost it with this story.  No problem with the science fiction--just the narrow thinking and inability of Koontz to think outside the California coastline.  That I cannot forgive.  Very disappointed in this effort.
B000F8O35U|5.0|In a wonderful kingdom under the sea lives the beautiful mermaid princess, Ariel, seventh and youngest daughter of King Triton, ruler of Atlantica. Ariel's feisty spirit and gorgeous red hair make her a bit of a favorite among Triton's daughters, and her passion for learning human ways and collecting of their artifacts causes much stress to her family and friends. After spying a handsome, young, human prince aboard a ship one evening and saving his life, Ariel is instantly love-struck, and this is completely unacceptable to her overbearing, human-hating father. In a desperate and rebellious action, Ariel turns to a seductive sea witch for help, who takes possession of Ariel's beautiful voice in exchange for a magical spell. The spell changes Ariel's fish-like tail into a lovely pair of human legs, but there is a condition attached. If Ariel can't get the young prince to fall in love with her in three days and seal it with a kiss, the spell will be broken and Ariel will join the witch Ursula's collection of hideously transformed victims. Luckily, the prince is in love with her already, though he doesn't know it. Prince Eric is obsessed with finding the young lady who saved him from drowning that night and whom he caught a glimpse of as she sang to him just before disappearing. When he takes in the now human Ariel after she appears seemingly washed up from a shipwreck, her inability to speak makes him sure she is not the one. Voiceless and only left with her beauty and exuberant charm, Ariel and her animal friends must try their best to make the prince see that she is the lost love he has been searching for, but the Sea Witch will do all she can to stop them before time runs out! If Ursula holds power over Princess Ariel, the king himself will have to bow down before her!<br /><br />Like \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Snow White\\" before it, \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" released in 1989, single-handedly saved Walt Disney Animation from total vaporization. Following a bit too modestly performing releases and the underrated but still not up to par flop, \\"The Black Cauldron,\\" this was a last chance for Disney animators to prove animation could still draw and please the film going public; and, boy, did they ever prove it! With just the right combination of story, music, voice talent, and visuals, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" turned out to be one of the Disney Studios' most perfect achievements! The Oscar winning music is particularly noteworthy, as one of  the film's most groundbreaking moves was bringing a Broadway style to its musical storytelling. This was thanks to the amazing team of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who would return to do more brilliant Disney music during the so-called \\"Renaissance\\" kicked-off by \\"The Little Mermaid.\\" Voice talents that must be mentioned are Disney legend Buddy Hackett as the voice of Scuttle, Ariel's dizzy Seagull friend, Samuel E. Wright as Sebastian, the little Caribbean crab that often steals the show, and, of course, Ariel the little mermaid herself, graced with the heavenly voice of Broadway actress Jodi Benson. Pat Carroll does a phenomenal job as the loathsome Ursula, and Christopher Daniel Barnes manages to be a vast improvement on past, rather bland Disney princes. The film, of course, is based on the famous fairytale by Hans Christian Anderson. The original story is actually a bit of a downer, something Anderson had a flair for, and the one, rare complaint that viewers sometimes make about the movie is how much it strays for its Disneyfied rewrite of the story, particularly with its happy ending. But, this complaint doesn't come up that often, and Disney's take successfully carries on the original theme of a mermaid wanting more than her under-sea life will allow. It also beautifully and convincingly handles the father/daughter relationship and the difficult issue of letting go when the time is right. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" continues to be one of Disney's most beloved animated classics, and with good reason.

It also beautifully and convincingly handles the father/daughter relationship and the difficult issue of letting go when the time is right. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" continues to be one of Disney's most beloved animated classics, and with good reason. It is no less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Now, this is easily one of my favorite Disney animated features. I suppose it is for most Disney fans, but with me there's an added incentive: I am absolutely in love with Ariel! Have been since she first splashed onto the big screen! I mean, she's pretty much perfection, with that voice, that bubbly personality, that hair, those eyes, that nose, those lips (notice, I'm not commenting on those seashells, because I'm not a pig, but they're great too), ... and when she gets legs, whoa! I'm so in love with her that I bought one of those overpriced, framed Jodi Benson autographs at Disney World once, along with one of the collectible reproduction animation cels. And this was when I was a student! I mean, I really had to save up for stuff like that! Anyways, point is, I was naturally very psyched about this new, 2-disc, Platinum Edition release of the film. And, in general, I'm very happy with it. There are a few items I don't know why were left out. However, I thankfully found one of them later as one of the two Easter Eggs on disc Two. But, without further ado, here are some details on the DVDs:  <br /> <br />Disc One contains the flick itself (in anamorphic widescreen), beautifully restored (though some have complained that it has been overly restored and isn't EXACTLY how the film was meant to look, but it still looks great) but with some slight editing. Yes, editing. It appears that the old Urban Legend about the minister in the wedding scene being aroused has been addressed, and that knee of his that some people imagined to be a different body part has been redrawn. Moving on, Disc One also has a wonderfully informative and at times touching commentary with writer/directors Ron Clements and John Musker, and composer Alan Menken. The late Howard Ashman, lyricist, is included too at times via audio recordings. One music video is included, and this is where I voice one of my complaints of something else that should have beenincluded too. The last VHS release of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" included a Jodi Benson video where she sings \\"Part of Your World\\" on a beach. This video is NOT the one included. What we get is a cute, Disney Channel star promoting video of Ashley Tisdale singing \\"Kiss the Girl,\\" and it's fine. I like it. I just think it's pretty bad that the Jodi Benson video wasn't included as well! Another Disc One extra is the Sing Along option for key musical moments in the film, though not all are included. We also are given a sneak peek of the extras on Disc Two, and the more interesting sneak peek at the upcoming sequel, \\"The Little Mermaid 3.\\" It's a clip of a scene that seems to vaguely remind me of an episode of the animated series where Ariel discovers Sebastian moonlighting as a performer at an undersea nightclub. Speaking of, let's hope the success of this Platinum DVD inspires the DVD release of the wonderful animated series as well. <br /> <br />Disc Two is where the majority of extra features can be found, and while I'm not blown away by the sheer amount of stuff (as I have been in some past Platinum releases), there's still lots of really neat stuff here. The main attraction here should be \\"Treasures Untold: The Making of the Little Mermaid,\\" which can be found in the Backstage Disney section, and it's certainly a great behind the scenes featurette on the making off the film, full of great interviews and insight into those difficult days at Disney Animation. However, one also wishes the old Disney Channel \\"Making Of\\" program was included too, hosted by Alyssa Milano (one of several supposed inspirations for Ariel), which would have had that wonderful \\"real-time\\" feeling that you don't get from \\"after-the-fact\\" interviews. Yes, that definitely should have been included in the \\"Platinum Edition.\\" Anyway, as I said, the main attraction here SHOULD be the behind the scenes featurette, but there's something else very special on Disc Two of \\"The Little Mermaid.\\" Two somethings, in fact. One is an unrelated Disney animated short film, \\"The Little Match Girl.\\" It's a beautifully done piece with a true to the story ending (believe it or not) that was originally intended for the canceled \\"Fantasia 2006.\\" No Disney fan should miss owning this amazing piece of Disney filmmaking! The other fantastically special something on Disc Two is filed under, believe it or not, Games and Activities. Yes, something GOOD under Games and Activities! It's an actual virtual ride on a Disney theme park attraction that was never created: an actual Little Mermaid ride! You can \\"ride\\" the ride by yourself, or with audio commentary, and there is even a featurette about the ride that \\"Never Was.\\" Disc Two also features some great deleted scenes selections, an improved DisneyPedia that plays all in one chunk, the original theatrical trailer, the very cool early presentation reel, a retrospective featurette on the effects unit, a charming featurette that looks at Hans Christian Anderson's Little Mermaid in comparison with Disney's take, and, of course, the art galleries. I always enjoy seeing the character development galleries, particularly of Disney's loveliest females. These galleries could be more thorough though, as I love to see promotional/advertising art and merchandising images too. Speaking of, there are two Easter Eggs on the Treasures Untold Menu, as I think I mentioned earlier. Why the McDonald's ornament commercial was not included as a third, I have no idea. I mean, they got permission to show it and yet only showed a couple of seconds of it during the making of featurette. This commercial, with it's wonderful, exclusive animation of Ariel and her fish friend, Flounder, would have been a perfect Easter Egg. Anyway, what we do get is one Easter Egg of the writer/directors drawing caricatures of each other, which is cute, but I'd rather have the commercial, and another Easter Egg about the live-action referencing. Now, this second one is the Easter Egg Iwas so happy to find! As I mentioned, I was soooo in love with Ariel from the moment the film came out, and this extended to a love for her voice (Jodi Benson) and her live action reference model, Sherri Stoner, who was basically a brunette Ariel. I adored Sherri in that behind the scenes special from when the film first came out and was so disappointed that footage of her performing as Ariel for the animators was not included in \\"Treasures Untold.\\" It wasn't even mentioned. She wasn't even mentioned! Well, while I do not feel it should have been relegated to an Easter Egg, I was so happy to find it after thinking none of it was included. It's not enough footage, we should have been given more, but it was still nice to see again along with the brief, recent interview moments with Sherri! And while I'm still sad that Jodi's video wasn't included as a Bonus Feature, that particular Easter Egg, plus \\"The Little Matchgirl,\\" plus the virtual theme park ride, and most importantly, the film itself, one of the best things ever to come from the Disney Studios, make this Platinum Edition DVD a MUST OWN! <br />
B000GPIPD8|4.0|The Black Keys are one of my favorite rock and roll bands with their garage band minimalism tempered by touches of blues and psychedelia. But I was a little surprised when the band signed to the eclectic Nonesuch label and wondered how this would affect their sound. Well, I needn't wonder at all as this album was literally recorded in a band member's basement and keeps the same raw and exciting sound as the bands previous work. Most of the songs are kept short and sweet with blistering blues based guitar and basic drumming giving way to melodic hooks like in \\"Your Touch\\" which is very catchy and has elements of pop without compromising their rough and tumble sound.<br /><br />\\"You're the One\\" slows things down to a ballad tempo with a gauzy, slightly trippy love song that plays against the bands stereotype. \\"Just a Little Heat\\" and \\"Give Your Heart Away\\" find the band hopping back on the boogie train, while the bluesy wail of \\"Strange Desire\\" goes back to the bands roots and shows the groups knows its strength and plays to it admirably as they do with the blasting \\"Modern Times\\" and the lengthy workout \\"Goodbye Babylon.\\" Anyone interested in unadorned rock and roll will find much to enjoy here.
0307346609|5.0|At 3/4 through this remarkable book, I am struck by the complexity and scope of Brooks' nightmarish vision.  His presentation is so utterly realistic and believable, that I find myslef looking down hallways, across parking lots, and along streets driving, wondering what my immediate actions will be in when the next zombie rising occurs.  Perhaps the most striking feature of this \\"history\\" is that it feels like real history; the reader develops the creeping suspicion that is will all happen \\"again\\" and desires to prepare. <br /> <br />Yes, I know it's just a book, a delicious horror immersion to thrill the mind's darker wanderings.  I'm a big fan of zombie movies and as such, inculcated with the imagery, the instinct not to get trapped in closed spaces, and the knowledge that only a head shot will do.  But the vast interlocking plot, the well-meant but thrashing responses from governments worldwide, the immensity of dispair...there has not been a book like this before.  I dread finishing it, beause I am enjoying it so much.  I hope for a sequel (or expanded tales), a movie or mini-series, and a video game.  Whether any of this occurs...BUY THIS BOOK.  And start becoming more attuned to any chewing, or moaning sounds when the shadows grow longer.

0618680004|5.0|Too many people grow up without the freedom to think through their choice to believe in superstition. A religion is forced upon their young, impressionable minds. Dawkins helps to free people from their brainwashing, and to grasp that their senses of wonder, morality, beauty, community, and love do not have to be attached to the delusion of a god. Once you step back from the delusion and view it as a brain virus then you regain your freedom and your ability to contribute productively to humanity. Until you do that you remain a bleeting sheep.
B000E5KJI4|5.0|The blind poet Homer wrote down the lives of Achilles and Hector, the two bravest warriors to come out of the Trojan War.  They were men who knew honor and wanted a lot out of life.  Achilles wanted ever-lasting fame.  Hector wanted his family, his people, and his country kept safe.  Ultimately, these two men came to deathblows.  Hector's brother, Paris, kidnapped Helen, the wife of Menelaus, from the Greeks.  This provided all the excuse Agamemnon needed to crush the Trojans and add them to his list of conquered people.  The Greeks sailed to Troy to reclaim their lost queen, but the war lasted a long time and proved more costly than anyone would have believed.  But Achilles and Hector were at the eye of that storm.<br /><br />Brad Pitt stars as Achilles and does a good job in the physical and emotional sense of the character.  Eric Bana plays Hector, and comes across as a noble champion.  The film was directed by Wolfgang Petersen, a director noted for his attention to detail and willingness to get the scene no matter what it takes.<br /><br />TROY is a throwback to old Hollywood style filmmaking.  With a cast of thousands.  Of course, most of them are really computer animation, so the numbers are actually in the hundreds.  But the movie is just BIG.  The HD DVD version features beautiful imagery and Lossless sound that really makes you glad you bought the surround sound system.  The story is so big that even when it finishes two hours and forty-plus minutes later, you scarcely notice the time.  Something is always going on.  Some character is always in trouble (or dying or grieving).<br /><br />I was familiar with the story from high school as well as college, but the two characters never touched me so much before.  Maybe it's because I'm older and realize now how much was truly at stake and how different things might have been.  But I choose to believe it's because the story was present so well, visually as well as emotionally.  The suspense was great, because you could see how fate would intervene again and again until there was no choice but for Hector and Achilles to fight, one man against the other.  TROY is a great addition to the home library whether you're a fan of one of the actors or big period movies.  Get it or rent it and you're in for a treat.use you could see how fate would intervene again and again until there was no choice but for Hector and Achilles to fight, one man against the other.

B00006AUIG|5.0|I have loved the horror genre as long as I can remember.  Unfortunately I can count the number of good horror films I have seen on the fingers of both hands.  By far the majority are just plain bad.    Then I discovered Session 9.  In my non-humble opinion this is the best horror movie since that towering giant \\"The Haunting\\" from the early 1960s.  Indeed it uses many of the same elements, especially the \\"less is more\\" principle.  There is almost no blood and gore in this movie and no special effects.  The creepiness is captured by a series of taped sessions with a mental patient who was housed in the asylum the movie is filmed in.    There are nine sessions in all, which are discovered and then played one at a time by a member of an asbestos removal crew that is working in the building.  The tapes are of a psychiatrist talking to a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder (not schizophrenia).  As the sessions progress other personalities talk through the woman.  Each mentions an entity named Simon that lives in the woman, but despite the doctor's best efforts he cannot convince Simon to speak - until the worker plays session 9, hence the title of the movie.    Along the way the asylum works on the minds of the crew, playing on each one's unique fears and weaknesses.  The finale is chilling as hell, really, really weird.    Suitable for Halloween or anytime, this one shouldn't be missed.
B000GUJHIA|4.0|Postwar is truly a huge achievement.  While it is a long book, it is actually short given how much ground Judt covers and how effectively he covers it.  the book starts with a great synopsis of some under-stated facts and thoughts about the impact that WWII had on Europe as a whole and on its constituent parts.  This book is worth reading for that synopsis alone.   <br /> <br />From there, Judt covers the varied periods of the social and political landscape in Europe over the course of sixty years.  He looks at Europe as a whole, but also at the individual regions and countries that make up Europe.  The amount of ground that he covers in 800 pages is quite amazing.  Time and time again, you find yourself learning about something you understood only tangentially in the past.  In addition to just covering the ground, Judt offers some really deep insights into these situations that give you a whole different level of understanding. <br /> <br />One theme that runs throughout the book is the physical and spiritual battle Europe fought over Communism over this period.  Judt really lays bare Communism as the unworkable idea it has proven to be.  It is a powerful message that Judt delivers very effectively. <br /> <br />One thing that is more strange than bad is Judt's treatment of the United States in this book.  Judt seems to want to make the point firmly that Europe does not owe anything good about its recent changes to America.  America's role in Europe's recent past is quite conspicuous in its absence for most of this book.  Then, in the last ten pages, Judt launches into an anti-American monologue that contrasts sharply with the America vacuum in the rest of the book.   <br /> <br />A lot of what Judt says about America is true and is probably important for Americans to hear.  Judt drives home the point that for most of the world it is the United States, not terrorists, that is viewed as the greatest threat to global peace and prosperity - good food for thought for Americans.  However, Judt's point about America is blunted by the fact that he's barely acknowledged its existence for the first 790 pages of the book.  It gives his verdict on the US the feel of a one-sided rant that actually undercuts its message. <br /> <br />I wouldn't let that stop you from reading this book.  The history and insights are great and even Judt's thoughts on America are important perspective for any American to have to round out their judgement about how the country handles itself on the world scene.
0451169514|5.0|Although I'm only 14 year old boy who lives in Utah, I've been a die hard Stephen King fan since I was twelve, and I have to say, this is really the high light of his career. <br /> <br />Don't be turned off by the massive length of this book, it goes by very quickly, and you'll be glued to it bye the first fifty of so pages. <br /> <br />As I'm sure you know, this is a coming of age story about seven children who together must face an evil that has plagued them and even gives them personal grudges. Other people have already gone over the basic story, but one thing that most of them failed to mention that I find very important is that after their child hood encounters with it, all of them But Mike Hanlon lose every memory they ever had of it. <br /> <br />Yes, this book is vulgar, it is violent, and there is some sexuality, it is an essential part of the story. It is over a thousand pages long, and each page is genius. I will go to my grave saying that this is the greatest book I've ever read, because it's so much more than a horror story. I think this book has greater characters than any other book I have ever read. This is a five star book, and is almost completely flawless. This is my favorite book, and some of Stephen King's other great works are The Dead Zone, Misery, The Shining, and Christine. <br /> <br />Read this book, it is well worth your time, I won't go in depth into the story, because hundreds of other people already have, but this book will scare the piss out of you, make you reflect on your childhood and the friends with whom you shared it, and really just change you. I can't express in words how great this is, but don't take my word for it. Buy it, rent it, whatever, just READ IT (no pun intended). <br />~Love, Dallas~ <br /> <br /> <br />
0307120007|2.0|I love this book and my son loves it too but really- I think they keep selling so many copies because people have to buy multiples when they fall apart!!!! <br /> <br />It would be great if they could make this in a board book without the spiral plastic ring and/or laminated pages to prevent tearing off the spiral ring. The pages easily rip off. <br /> <br />At $10 bucks each- I feel \\"ripped\\" off.
B000HCO840|4.0|The Phoenix saga, as crafted by Chris Clairmont & John Byrne is arguably one of the greatest stories ever told.  That a mere film can give some small intimation of that genius is quite an accomplishment... & Ian McKellan shines once again.  Worth it, if You have any imagination...
B000060K4O|5.0|I'd have to say, Ghostbusters I is still an old favorite.  Bill Murray was/is terrific in this; this is his funniest comedy to date.  The script was original, the music had good beats, and dialogue snappy.  The story actually made sense (unlike GB II) and the suspense of Gozer made me feel like New York City, the world, the Ghostbusters themselves were in big time trouble.<br /><br />Quite an excellent movie and is a timeless classic. they should NOT make another GB sequel, please, Harold Ramis, Ivan Reitman, do us a favor and yourselves a favor--DON't do another Ghostbusters movie!
B00005R8GU|5.0|Fathers and Sons was a concept album from Chess that paired blues masters like Muddy Waters and Otis Spann with young guns like Mike Bloomfield and Pual Butterfield.  Following the success of this album, Chess sent Muddy and Howlin' Wolf to London to record with the best of the British rockers. This is by far the best of the series and the best of this album lies in the live cuts. The studio cuts are very good, but sound a little generic compared to the outstanding live music. The all star band rips up songs like 'Long Distance Telephone Call'and 'Got my Mojo Working' and really slows it down for 'That Same Thing', which may be the finest live blues song ever recorded.  This is a great blues CD.  You will not be disappointed.
B00009ZYBY|1.0|I don't understand why this won Oscars, or why people think this is good.  It had one great scene: the chariot battle in the Colleseum. That's really the only thing worth seeing in this entire film.  Russel Crowe's \\"character\\", Maximus screams Braveheart in a Roman guise. It was overmelodramatic, the music was bad, and the cinematics was worse.<br /><br />Russel Crowe is no actor, he reminds me of Marlon Brando in Street Car Named Desire.  All he does is bellow....yay.  He was not even close to Heroic. Though, he's a little bit better than Mel Gibson or Brando in those chosen films.<br /><br />It really would have been Braveheart, had they forced Russel Crowe to speak Spanish....&lt;shudders at the imagination of it>.  If they changed the \\"acting\\" for Crowe, why not change the character into an Englishman, or something....calling him \\"The Spaniard\\" all the time made me laugh when I watched the movie.<br /><br />This film reeked and I'm glad I never had the urge to buy the DVD, or see ANY Crowe's movies; although I was forced to watch Master And Commander as rental...and it was all right, if you liked sea-faring movies with big special effects.<br /><br />'-20 on the Rating Scale of Pukedom.
0060229357|5.0|If you have a small child who is not crazy about books, try this one.  I have yet to read it to a kindergarten class who was not enthralled with it. Harold is a delight for young and old.  He is lovable and at the same time all-powerful, wielding his purple crayon as he chooses.  This is a classic no family should be without.
B000AL5OZK|5.0|This was Agnetha F&auml;ltskog's first solo album in English.  I have the original Svenska (Swedish) LP on Polar.  I made a backup on CD-R (that's legal).  This was available in the US once (on Polydor), and \\"Can't Shake Loose\\" even went to #29 on Billboard here for a while, the same for \\"The Heat is On\\" in the UK and other territories until the heat was off.  Australian producer Mike Chapman, best known for Blondie and half of the 1972-73 UK glam scene, produced and co-wrote some of this solo d&eacute;but.<br />When promoting the album in Deutschland, she said ABBA were taking a break.  It was a hard act to follow.  She had already been a star in her own right back in Sverige (Sweden), but it was different for the whole free world.<br />Bonus tracks include \\"Never Again\\" with former ABBA backing vocalist Tomas Ledin, \\"It's So Nice to Be Rich\\", never released in the Americas (probably because of its boastfulness), the B-side \\"P&B\\", from the film \\"Rakenstam\\", and a 12\\" version of \\"The Heat is On\\".  Universal Chronicles ought to reissue this and other ABBA solo albums here so money doesn't have go to the EU or a third party.  Also, some of the tracks are hard to find on mp3, legal or not.  Recommended for die-hard fans.
B000023VR6|5.0|Dr. Dre is the best rap producer and his beats are the best. I'm a white kid who listens to indie, punk, and alternitive, but I'm very picky about the rap I listen to. Dre has it for me. Only Dre, Snoop, Wu-Tang Clan, and Jurassic 5. If I love Dr.Dre, its because he's the best, not cause he's one of those one hit wonder rappers. Dre's 2001 is one of the best Cd's in rap history, and if you want to listen to the best, listen to Dre.
B000GG4XJM|1.0|I'm a bit at odds with this work because these are not songs written by Pete Seeger. Does it not seem just a tad suspicious that Springsteen deliberately did not use a single song that was actually written by Seeger? Instead using songs \\"made popular by\\" Seeger to avoid paying royalty fees while freely using songs in the public domain waste bin of lapsed copyrighted material. Then, after using these lapsed songs, he went out and ascertained his own copyright for the arrangements. Therefore, if other artists would like to do these songs, they now have to pay Bruce a royalty fee! You know, for a socialist he's one heck of a capitalist by commandeering these songs for free to maximize his profits. Isn't this at odds with his own well crafted champion of the underdog image? This American Land edition is aptly titled because even though Bruce despises the American capitalist economic system of free markets, he plays it like a fiddle for his own accumulation of wealth.
B000001GMH|4.0|'Carmina Burana' by Carl Orff is easily one of the major movements if one were to make a soundtrack of the 20th century, along with the likes of 'The Rites of Spring', 'Rapsody in Blue', 'Mack the Knife / Mackie Messer', 'Tommy', 'Sargeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' and 'Take the A-Train'. I have heard it used as part of both advertising and themes to intro news pieces for the last 20 years, with its use increasing at almost the same rate as the use of 'The Who's 'Baba O'Reilly'. While I have not heard many of the dozens of other recordings available, I have heard it performed live several times, and this issue is quite acceptable to my ears.<br /><br />For any who are totally unfamiliar with this work (and happen to stumble on this review while checking out the latest cookbooks)it is NOT from the Middle Ages (althought there IS a middle ages work of the same name). It was written in the 1930s and based on Medieval texts. As you can tell from the many recordings, it probably rivals Mozart's unfinished Requium as one of the most commonly recorded choral works.<br /><br />If you are proud of your classical music collection and do not have a recording of this work, get one now!
B000060OFT|4.0|Romeo smoking cigarettes? The family feud being played out in fast cars with faster assault rifles? Well, yes. But Leonardo DiCaprio and Clare Danes speak the classic lines surprisingly well, and the essential tale of ill-fated and fatal love comes through this jazzed-up version anyway. When this was released on the big screen, I took my teen daughter to see it, and I think she got a lot out of it. So, while the Olivia Hussey/Leonard Whiting version from the late 1960's is still my favorite, this telling is not at all bad.
B000GFLE1S|3.0|As a tale, \\"Kinky Boots\\" is middling at best.  It has the earmarks of most films of this type, and you can see them coming a mile away (boss will eventually pair up with the spunky underling and come to see that wife is uncaring and cold; hard-hearted worker will eventually see the light and accept cross-dressing newcomer for who he is; team will unexpectedly show up to work throughout the night when the chips are down).<br /><br />But the film is really recommendable nevertheless because of Chiwetel Ejiofor 's over-the-top (I mean that as a compliment) performance as Lola/Simon.  I have to assume that's him really singing.  If so, wow! For those of us used to Ejiofor's understated roles in excellent dramas like \\"Dirty Pretty Things,\\" his scene-chewing here shows that he's an actor capable of quite a wide range of impressions.
B000GY729M|1.0|I would much rather hear this band do a great Smith's/Psych Furs impression (as on Hot Fuss) than a godawful one of Springsteen/U2. Unfortunately, Sam's town is the later. The Killers are no longer a guilty pleasure. The sophomore jinx lives...and the only listeners giving their latest disc a decent review are those who don't want to admit that they just blew $15. Denial is a powerful thing.
B00005JPDP|4.0|Everyone who read Patrick Suskind's \\"Das Parfum\\" must remember how well-scented and at the same time fetid it was. Every page of the novel effuses some smell and it literally makes you either savor it or hold your nose in disgust. Suskind's talent in describing different kinds of flavour can't be overestimated, like a real poet he finds words and metaphors that sometimes let you salivate and sometimes bring you very close to throwing up. In my opinion the main challenge of this film from the very beginning of its creation was: will this movie smell like the book does?<br /><br />Many great directors were to make \\"Perfume...\\" and many washed their hands for a variety of reasons. Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman, Tim Burton and others - all of them were once attached to the project and walked away. Stanley Kubrick nurtured the idea of filming Suskind's novel for a long time but finally concluded \\"Das Parfum\\" was UNFILMABLE. And I can understand that - the book based on all kinds of odours is very hard to be put on celluloid. So walking to the theater I was recalling the book's first scene taking place at Paris' fish market couple of centuries back and thinking - will it all smell?<br /><br />And - oh, my God - it did! It smelled and it reeked right from the screen. Certainly the book smelled better (or worse in this case) but those things you do not see but only imagine always hit harder, so I doubt any movie can be better than a book. But in this case actually it wasn't this film's idea - to top the novel, it just had to match it distantly. And it matched indeed. \\"Perfume...\\" is no cheap adaptation of another book - it's a piece of art of its own and it deserves some recognition. Tom Tykwer - a young German director whose best-known work to date was \\"Run, Lola, Run\\" seemed rather strange candidate to direct this picture at the first glance, but ultimately it turned out to be a wise idea. Tykwer is not afraid to experiment and we've seen it in \\"Lola\\". Many of his patterns and tricks from that movie were later used by a number of directors around the world. He is innovative and that's a fact. If you close your eyes and try hard to imagine what Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman or Tim Burton would do with this picture, I bet you'll come up with some idea and I bet it will be right. But what could we expect from Tom Tykwer? Only some surprise.<br /><br />Finally there were no surprise and in \\"Perfume...\\" Tykwer didn't invent anything. It was pretty traditional I'd say, but still very professional, magnificent and exciting. Still better than I think any other director would manage it. And what's most important - it SMELLED. It had all the scents and fragrances needed to feel yourself inside this movie. Tykwer didn't do the impossible, but he was very close... And in this case it's a hell of an achievement.<br /><br />Actors deserve a whole separate article, I'll only say Ben Whishaw and everyone else except Dustin Hoffman were awesome and the latter is still playing the role of Bernie Focker as it seems with all my respect :) Although I like THAT role of his a lot I think here he could be a little more serious. On the other hand - don't pay attention to my lamentations - a comic part was never too bad for any movie. So maybe it's just me. Anyway - why 4 stars? 5 would go for the impossible done by the director, but unfortunately I'm positive it was impossible to do so (no pun intended). Hence 4 is the highest rating this picture can get in my opinion and I'm giving it the highest rating possible.rom that movie were later used by a number of directors around the world.

0307341542|5.0|One gripe I have about most thrillers is that the plot is all-important, and the characters end up so dull -- interchangeable, really. Not so with Camille in Sharp Objects! She's an incredibly-flawed and fragile character who I'm sure will haunt me for a long time, and whom I'll be reminded of sometimes when I see a certain type of person on the street. <br /> <br />I found this book to be an emotional experience because the deeper I got into Camille's world and the more I learned her personal story, the more I realized that her discovery of who the murderer was would have the potential to absolutely destroy her -- and she's someone who, by all rights, really should have hit bottom by now. <br /> <br />A short, terse book you won't soon forget.
0062502182|1.0|I feel like I am pushing against the tide, but perhaps I can warn others, like me, who agreed to read this book because of comparisons to St. Exupery's classic, The Little Prince.  It is too late to warn off my book club.  Others expecting anything remotely as charming, disarming, witty, and downright delightful as Le Petit Prince should look elsewhere.  I have read St. Exupery, Mr. Coelho, and you are no St. Exupery. <br /> <br />Perhaps it is the translator who lets us down, but the underlying text lays it on so thick that I doubt it.  Where the Little Prince is light on its feet, The Alchemist is sluggish and burdened to groaning with its own ethical importance.  Where the Little Prince repeatedly pierces and nudges us with the persistent and indefatigable wisdom of children, The Alchemist slogs on through its mythic mish-mash of hazy, tired images.  Where the Little Prince constantly surprises us, The Alchemist surprised me mainly by its insistence on piling the cliches on.   <br /> <br />When I got to the \\"darkest moment comes just before the dawn,\\" I thought Coelho might be pulling my leg, trying to see how much foolishness he could wrap together before I caught on.  And when, on the very next page, he spoke of how God protects children and drunks, I could hear him screaming with laughter--when will they all catch on?!  On and on.  But the ladling is SO thick that Coelho hasn't made much of a game of it.  There is nothing playful in sight.  I can only assume that Coelho is sincere and actually believes that the frailest cliches bear repeating.  Over and over and over. <br /> <br />I do have one good thing to say about the book.  It convinced me to return to the Little Prince to see if my memory had failed me.  Mais non!  After far too many years, I rediscovered the dashing companion of my youth, as fresh now as he was then, but full of new meanings I could not have guessed at then.  If you seek a spiritual journey that might refresh you in the most unpredictable ways, try The Little Prince instead.  It's short.  It's delightfully illustrated.  It's cheap.  And it's actually worth your time.   <br /> <br />
0743455967|5.0|I'm your plain everyday wanting to be writer. I found, 'On Writing' to be one of the best books I've read. Mr. King writes of his childhood and life in the first part of this book, then in the second half gives advice on how to write, which I have highlighted and marked up something awful. I was one of those teenagers he talks about in his book, that failed English in high school, and thought I was dumb, because of it. I did write as a child, only for myself, not like Mr. King who wrote for Dave's Rag. I loved the parts that spoke of his and his brothers dreams, escapades, or just having fun growing up. It brought back memories of me and my brother. I've read a few books by King, but I find I loved this one the most. I'm one of the older crowd, five years older then Mr. King. I wish he would write more books on plain everyday life, as he lived with his brother and mother, for me and others out there who don't want to read murder, mystery, etc. I'm not saying I didn't like Misery, because I did. I guess now in my elder years I'm just looking for a little less anxiety. I guess I'm what you call \\"old\\" and want to think of the world as a loving place and nothing more. I know I'm just dreaming about loving your neighbor, but I \\"do\\" believe that people are out there to love one another. I tried my hand at self publishing a book named, \\"Fears Flutterby\\", maybe if Mr. King reads this he can give me some tips.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|Like so many other reviewers of Glen Hansard/The Frames related albums I have to start out by saying that Glen and The Frames should be huge in the US, but instead they've been virtually ignored for the last 10+ years. Fortunately, a friend who studied in Ireland introduced me to The Frames about 4 years ago. The first album I heard was Dance the Devil, and to be honest, I was not blown away upon the initial listen. As one who considers himself a bit of an indie snob (i.e., I spend way too much on vinyl records in order to carry on conversations about the most esoteric bands), I thought The Frames sounded just a little too familiar (Colm's violin aside), as if they hadn't quite been able to distance themselves from their influences. Then I saw them live after the release of Burn the Maps, and everything changed. After seeing them live, there was no question that this music comes from deep within each of the band members and is not simply their take on the artists that influenced them. For the last two years, I have consistently listened to The Frames more than any other band (and I'm almost always listening to music) and have yet to get bored with their music.     As with most of The Frames' material, this cd did not blow me away upon first listen. There are some excellent standout tracks in which Glen and Marketa's emotion is nicely captured: \\"Falling Slowly\\", \\"Leave\\", and Marketa's solo, \\"Alone Apart\\" are some of my favorites. And like all The Frames albums, there's even some choruses that you simply will not be able to get out of your head, something that is all too often lacking in some of the supposedly more \\"avant garde\\" indie albums.     Living in DC I was fortunate enough to see Glen and Marketa perform these songs live last week during their six-day tour of the US. Since then this album has taken on a whole new life for me. This album has gone from being just another solid Frames/Glen Hansard release to being my favorite album of 2006 in 4 short days. Any album that you can listen to more than 10 times in 4 days is surely in contention for that title; when you realize that every conversation since you saw the music performed has begun with an account of how unforgettable the show was, you know you've found your favorite album of the year.    Due to the fact that the tour is so short, I doubt anyone reading this will be able to catch them live this time around, but that certainly should not prevent you from purchasing this album. Unfortunately the Frames have never fully captured their magic on compact disc form, and this release too suffers from that shortcoming. So, though it may not become everybody's favotie album of the year, there's no doubt in my mind that anyone who listens to the beautiful string, piano, and guitar arrangements topped with some of the most heartfelt vocals in all of music will appreciate this album on some level. The music is familiar enough to appreciate on first listen, but with repeated listens, one continues to uncover layer after layer of both sorrow and joy. It is Hansard's ability to convey these two emotions simultaneously in so many of his songs that has won him some of the most devoted fans of any artist, even if record sales may not compare to artists with 1/100th of his sincerity. This will not be one of those albums you rave about for 4 months only to hear it mentioned a year later and realize you've totally lost interest in it. It is one of those albums that you will listen to for years to come only to realize that every listening experience is more rewarding than the last.

B00064ADR0|5.0|Prior to hearing 'Second Winter,' one of my favorite electric Blues tunes had been when then-unknown Johnny Winter joined Michael Bloomfield on stage at the Filmore East and played an unbelievable 11 minute version of BB's 'It's My Own Fault.' I highly recommend getting your hands on that, but the slower 12 minute version included here is equally as good.  It really showcases Johnny's amazing ability to combine lightning-fast speed with deep, emotion-jarring blues.  This Cd validates that Johnny was one of the best Blues-Rock guitarists during his prime era.  Another great blues track on this CD set is the live version of the classic 'Mama Talk to Your Daughter.' If you're looking for more great slow blues by Johnny, look for 'Be Careful with a Fool,' 'Mean Mistreater (live),' and 'You Keep Saying that You're Leaving.'
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I ordered this item off of Amazon two days after its release. I was so excited to get it in the mail, and I have been listening to the CD nonstop for a week now. The songs all mesh together to form a cohesive album, and Amy Lee's voice is nothing less than exemplary. Currently my favorite songs are track 7, \\"Lacrymosa,\\" and track 13, \\"Good Enough.\\" Track 7 has an amazing backdrop of classical music that shows off Lee's songwriting prowess and track 13 is just wonderful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album to anyone who liked the first album. While it is different, it is still amazing.

6304698623|5.0|Wow!  This was one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life, perhaps, the best, in terms of emotion, enchantment, innocence, and slightly \\"magical\\".   <br /> <br />I can't believe how well Liesel acted in this movie.  My goodness!  Such an incredible act for such a young age.  It's a movie to see by yourself or with your family.  It may bring you tears...  I rarely cry for movies, and this one just made the tears pour right down my face.  Tears of sorrow, joy and excitement.   <br /> <br />You you want to see a good family friendly film, watch this, it will touch your heart.
0393312836|5.0|Burgess vision of the future is one of totalitarian control and violence at the point of chaos.  The authorities have given up the night to the youth gangs that then menace citizens in both the street and in their houses.  What is scariest of these thoughts is that the perpetrators of this violence are kids under the age of eighteen.  Our protagonist, Alex, is fifteen and his droogs (friends) are not much older.  They rob, rape, drink, take drugs. <br /> <br />Once you get past the language (try not to spend too much time looking at the glossary), there is a powerful message about good and evil. Alex is arrested for murder and then commits a second in prison.  A new treatment based on drugs and aversion therapy has been developed to control the 'bad' impulses, and Alex is chosen as the first prisoner to be treated. As is to be expected, the treatment does more than just stop Alex from being 'bad' it takes away his ability to protect himself (in more ways than one). <br /> <br />This is the full version of the book.  The original american version was missing Part 3 Chapter 7.  For anyone who has read the pre-1986 version or seen the Kubrick-McDowell movie, the missing chapter will come as a revelation.  In his intro to the novel, Burgess himself discusses the meaning of the last chapter and what was his motivation. Read it and make your own conclusions...which is what Burgess was going for in the first place.
B000056OBA|3.0|Buyers beware: this is a famous set, usually seen as the the best of Karajan's three cycles, but also a pedantic conductor's clinical Beethoven, lacking the gravity of, say, the Klemperer or Furtw&auml;ngler breathtaking performances. Nonetheless, BPO sounds great, even if Karajan prevents the brass and timpani from playing as they should (they are often nearly inaudible). For example, check the final pages of the ninth symphony, where it sounds as if Karajan's orchestra just has flutes and strings, almost nothing else - despite the forte markings for trombones.<br /><br />Sound is clear but not outstanding.<br /><br />Standouts, nonetheless, are the third, fifth, and ninth symphonies, which boast excellent playing from BPO. But Karajan's accounts are miles away from the powerful and unforgettably moving interpretations we have from Furtw&auml;ngler (M & A), Klemperer (EMI), Toscanini (RCA), B&ouml;hm (DG, three separate twofers), and - more recently - Abbado (DG). So if you look for the real Beethoven symphony experience: look elsewhere!
B000HIVO64|5.0|This is not really a review for the CD which is just sick (that's good).  I downloaded the bonus track thinking whatever, it's free. I'll listen then delete it.  I have no idea why it's not on the CD!  I guess they're really trying to get legitimate songs as bonus tracks so you'll actually read about how good it is and feel like you need to go rebuy it which sucks.  But anyway, get your hand on it somehow.  It's one of the best tracks on the CD (or not on the CD I should say!)
B0000C03AH|3.0|Buyers beware: this is a famous set, originally recorded in 1962 (published in 1963), and it is usually seen as the best of Karajan's three cycles. Now it appears in the SACD format. But it must be noted that this is a pedantic conductor's clinical Beethoven, lacking the gravity of, say, the Klemperer or Furtw&auml;ngler breathtaking performances. In my view, this is to misunderstand the revolutionary power that these works actually have (i.e., as scores). Nonetheless, BPO sounds great, even if Karajan prevents the brass and timpani from playing as they should (they are often nearly inaudible). For example, check the final pages of the ninth symphony, where it sounds as if Karajan's orchestra just has flutes and strings, almost nothing else - despite the forte markings for trombones.<br /><br />Standouts, nonetheless, are the third, fifth, and ninth symphonies, which boast excellent playing from BPO. But Karajan's accounts are miles away from the powerful and unforgettably moving interpretations we have from Furtw&auml;ngler (M & A), Klemperer (EMI), Toscanini (RCA), B&ouml;hm (DG, three separate twofers), and - more recently - Abbado (DG). So if you look for the real Beethoven symphony experience: look elsewhere!<br /><br />Sound is clear but not outstanding - and no SACD incarnation in the world will improve Karajan's lack of understanding.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Pearl Jam has been misunderstood for so long.  They keep popping out music and people say that you have to have an acquired taste for their music.  Other people compare every record to \\"Ten.\\"  However, my belief is that each CD that they pop out is a vision of how they see things during that period and they try to be innovators in their business, which sometimes does not produce a radio friendly CD.  However I do not recall any bad CDs and despite negative reviews of some past CDs Pearl Jam has the star power to sell out any venue on a moments notice despite their \\"lack of radio friendly\\" tracks.  This CD is spectacular.  As said by the catalog reviewers, they go back to basics with a garage band sound with hard guitar duets, bumping drums, thumping base and of course a voice that is unrivaled in that of Vedder.  Each song is great, multi-layered, message sending and relevant.  Whatever your political views are, and mine are not in sync with PJ, you have to love the art of their music.  This is one of their best CDs.  There are not many groups that can give you multi-layers within each song, usually its song and chorus, but PJ gives us more where it makes you feel like you are getting so much more from each song.  There is no real experimenting on this CD what has been sited as a flaw on past CDs.  I like every song, most are high energy, just a couple ballads and some of those turn from ballads into a full on attack as momentum builds within the song.  I am especially fond of \\"Inside Job\\" as it is a complex song showcasing the talents of the entire band and their range as musicians.
B0002F7I9Y|2.0|I love Ray Charles when Ray's doing Ray.  This was terrible.  Ray was out of tune, out of touch and the song selection was ridiculous.  I'm sorry Ray, I love you.  It's a shame this had to be one of your last CD's.
0679405631|5.0|First serialized in 1859, and then published as a novel in 1860, The Woman in White, by Wilkie Collins, has, tellingly, never been out-of-print since the time of our Civil War.<br /><br />The Woman in White is a richly-phrased and atmospheric page-turner that, in a complicated and rather unique fashion, reveals its mystery slowly, even luxuriously, through the testimonies of a host of memorable characters, such as the capable Marian Holcombe, and her nemesis, one of literature's more intriguing creations, the suave villain, Count Fosco.<br /><br />Weighing in at a hefty 600-plus pages, The Woman in White may appear daunting to some; but the pairing of Collins' writing, which is often sublime, and his method of story-telling, which is always interesting, should, if given the chance, prove a winning-combination to most.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><br />Wilkie Collins: [[ASIN:0375757856 The Moonstone]].<br /><br />Boris Akunin: [[ASIN:0812968778 The Winter Queen: A Novel (Erast Fandorin Mysteries)]] and [[ASIN:0812975138 Sister Pelagia and the White Bulldog (Sister Pelagia Mysteries)]], which are but the first excellent books in their respective series.<br /><br />Gaston Leroux: [[ASIN:078626991X The Mystery of the Yellow Room]]; [[ASIN:1873982984 The Perfume of the Lady in Black]]; [[ASIN:1603122389 The Secret of the Night]]; and let us not forget about Leroux's most-popular book, The Phantom of the Opera, or even the little-known but still enjoyable [[ASIN:0766162141 Bride of the Sun]].<br /><br />Caleb Carr: [[ASIN:0812976142 The Alienist: A Novel]]; [[ASIN:0345427637 The Angel of Darkness]].

B0000017CA|2.0|I listen to this band and want to slip on some old Swans for real music! This band frightening? A nu-metal listening wimp, would think so. Personally this sounds like Swans with training wheels on. Get Cop or Filth Public Castration Is A good Idea for the REAL brutal dark and beautiful music. Acid Bath is more like Acid Re-flux.
B000GY729M|4.0|Some critics have likened The Killers \\"Sam's Town\\" to a gamble, which the band has ultimately lost. I agree with the critics in the fact that this is not \\"Hot Fuss\\", nor was it meant to be. The Killers, with seasoned producers in tow, have created a more moving atmosphere than available with their first effort. Here, the glimmer of electronica takes a backseat to the soaring, emotion-filled landscapes reminiscent of U2's \\"The Joshua Tree\\", making for a great complimentary album to \\"Hot Fuss\\".  <br /> <br />Overeager listeners will be disappointed that the album doesn't provide the barrage of Top 10 hits that the previous album did, although \\"When You Were Young\\" is arguably their strongest single to date and is sure to have you singing it in the shower shortly after a first listen. There is a little something for everyone on this album, from the opening track, \\"Sam's Town\\", to the catchy, piano-driven \\"Enterlude\\" and \\"Exitlude\\", to the highly inspired \\"This River is Wild\\", to the latter half gems \\"My List\\" and in my opinion their most emotionally stirring song to date, the pensive \\"Why Do I Keep Counting?\\". Admittedly, a few \\"snoozer\\" tracks are peppered in between, but you will not be disappointed with the overall direction provided in this album.  <br /> <br />I hope this album inspires you to multiple listens as it has me. The versatility shown on this album provides proof positive that the Killers are one of the top bands in music today, and should assure nay-sayers of this band's longevity for years to come. Enjoy!
0307346609|3.0|If your politics lean strongly to the left, and you like zombie fiction, this could be the book for you. The idea is interesting, at any rate. <br /> <br />Personally, though, I grew rapidly bored with the silly politics of it all. The liberal charaters think like liberals and the conservative characters think like liberals think evil conservatives think.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Epic and anthemic, and yet every track can be listened to without the others.  It tells a great story and has a great set of characters.  Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming particularly stick out in my mind.  If you don't have it already, get it.
B00015YVD6|4.0|Considerng the adult humor and partial nudity, I was lucky as a kid to even be allowed to watch this movie on cable, especially since the \\"Blue Lagoon\\" came out shortly beforehand. My parents probably thought this was an innocent little film about mermaids. Some 22 years later, the movie still manages to be funny and charming...plus, now I get all the jokes. Who can resist a tale about finding the woman of your dreams who turns out to be more than what you bargained for?  If you watch the credits at the end of the movie, you'll see the underwater city that Madison came from, something I had never noticed before. Ron Howard, Eugene Levy, Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah and John Candy probably never thought this movie would be the platform for making them huge A-list stars some twenty years later.    This is a classic and a keeper.  Future generations will enjoy as well.
0618680004|1.0|Like all atheists, Richard Dawkins does not understand the concept of God and why God exists. He has been told this before:<br /><br />\\"This is as good a moment as any to forestall an inevitable retort to the book, one that would otherwise--as sure as night follows day--turn up in a review: 'The God that Dawkins doesn't believe in is a God that I don't believe in either. I don't believe in an old man in the sky with a long white beard.'... I am attacking God, all gods, anything and everything supernatural, wherever and whenever they have been or will be invented.\\" (p. 36)<br /><br />In this review, I will try to succeed where others have failed so that we can say of Dawkins, \\"And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith...\\"<br /><br />Dawkins is an atheist because he places too much confidence in the methods and ideas of science. Working scientists are just people living their lives in a practical and reasonable manner. If something unusual occurs in the lab, scientists assumes there is a reason and try to replicate what happened. This is the same kind of common sense and reason mothers use when they assume there has been no change in the number of children they have when they are out shopping.<br /><br />Since we are human beings, we are capable of more than just making a living and getting through the day. We are capable of asking questions that can't be answered. We are capable of philosophizing, in other words, and are perfectly justified in criticizing people whose philosophizing is irrational. In America, we treat people who believe in ghosts much worse than we treat atheists.<br /><br />An example of an unanswerable philosophical question is the mind-body problem: What is the relationship between myself and my body? Dawkins, ever the scientist, does not agree that the question has no answer. This is what he says:<br /><br />\\"A dualist acknowledges a fundamental distinction between matter and mind. A monist, by contrast, believes that mind is a manifestation of matter--material in a brain or perhaps a computer--and cannot exist apart from matter. A dualist believes the mind is some kind of disembodied spirit that inhabits  the body and therefore conceivably could leave the body and exist somewhere else.\\" (p. 180)<br /><br />This form of monism is called materialism or physicalism. Another form of monism is idealism, which is the philosophy that the material world doesn't exist. To understand this, imagine that you are sitting on a big rock and feeling gratitude to God for your existence. It occurs to you that God created the rock so you could sit on it and that God could just as easily have created in your mind the illusion of the rock. If you conclude that there is no reason to think the rock really exists, you are an idealist.<br /><br />Bishop George Berkeley was alone when he thought this up and was relating in a very static and passive way to the rock. Our relations with other people, however, are not passive and static but active and dynamic. There is no question that other people exist because they throw rocks at us, one way or another, and the rocks are real.<br /><br />This refutation of idealism leads to the concept of God and God's existence. While the mind-body problem makes it impossible to define man, the fact that we are different from other people means we can say: Man is a finite being. God is a being which is not like this. God is not finite, but infinite or totally other. We know God exists because a finite being can't be the reason or for its own existence. This is the metaphysical view of man and God that I learned as an undergraduate at a Catholic college from 1960-1964.<br /><br />A reason for the appeal of Dawkins's philosophy of man is in Webster's Third International Dictionary. Definition 4.c of substance  is the one used by chemists, a sect in the religion of science. The definition of metaphysics, however, has nothing to do with physics. I suggest that Dawkins is willing to consider dualism and monism because the concept substance  is implied, and is not willing to consider metaphysics because the concept of being  is not scientific. Strangely, he seems to be aware that his monist/dualist analysis is not based on personal experience. Continuing from the above quote:<br /><br />\\"F. Amstey's 1882 novel Vice Versa makes sense to a dualist, but strictly should be incomprehensible to a dyed-in-the-wool monist like me...Like most scientists, I am not a dualist, but I am nevertheless easily capable of enjoying Vice Versa and Laughing Gas. Paul Bloom would say this is because, even though I have learned to be an intellectual monist, I am a human animal and therefore evolved as an instinctive dualist. The idea that there is a me perched somewhere behind my eyes and capable, at least in fiction, of migrating into somebody else's head, is deeply ingrained in me and in every other human being, whatever our  intellectual pretensions to monism. (p. 180, emphasis added)<br /><br />Why pretend? Why not be honest and accept reality as you find it? Why say that free will is an illusion and the self is an epiphenomena? This is what fellow atheist Lee M. Silver says (See my previous review of Challenging Nature: The Clash of Science and Spirituality). Dawkins's friend Daniel Dennett likewise considers dualism and materialism to be the only philosophical choices (See my previous review of Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomena). Why believe and say something is true when you can't see the truth of it?<br /><br />Professor Dawkins is willing to discuss the philosophy of being (metaphysics) when he thinks he can refute the proof of God's existence. He restates Aquinas's arguments and says:<br /><br />\\"All involve an infinite regress--the answer to a question raises a prior question, and so on ad infinitum...All three of these arguments rely upon the idea of a regress and invoke God to terminate it. They make the entirely unwarranted assumption that God himself is immune to the regress. \\"(p. 77)<br /><br />The last sentence is a reference to David Hume's refutation: Who made God? Hume misconstrued the principle of causality which is that every contingent being  needs a cause. Hume thought Aquinas was saying every being  needs a cause.<br /><br />Dawkins continues the previous quote as follows:<br /><br />\\"Even if we allow the dubious luxury of arbitrarily conjuring up a terminator to an infinite regress and giving it a name, simply because we need one, there is absolutely no reason to endow that terminator with any of the properties normally ascribed to God: omnipotence, omniscience, goodness, creativity of design, to say nothing of such human attributes as listening to prayers, forgiving sins and reading innermost thoughts.\\" (p. 77)<br /><br />The regress Dawkins is referring to is a hypothetical chain of contingent beings in the metaphysical proof of God's existence. In this proof, a contingent being needs a cause and a self-sufficient or necessary being does not. Dawkins is mistakenly assuming that a self-sufficient being must terminate a contingent chain, so he is calling the self-sufficient being a \\"terminator.\\" It can also exist outside of the chain and give the entire chain existence.<br /><br />In his list of divine properties, Dawkins leaves out the key property of God which is the infinity of God. This is the basis of the proof of God's existence: a finite being needs a cause, but an infinite being does not. Saying there is no reason to say God is infinite is nonsense. Continuing with this long quote:<br /><br />\\"Incidentally, it has not escaped the notice of logicians that omniscience and omnipotence are mutually incompatible. If God is omniscient, he must already know how he is going to intervene to change the course of history using his omnipotence. But that means he can't change his mind about his intervention, which means he is not omnipotent.\\" (p. 78)<br /><br />This is a new one on me. The three arguments against God I know about are<br /><br /> Why does God let innocent people suffer?<br /><br /> What motivated an infinite being to create finite beings?<br /><br /> How can we have free will if God knows what our actions will be?<br /><br />In the chapters titled 'Arguments for God's Existence' and 'Why There Is Most Certainly No God' there is no reference to finite beings and infinite beings. Dawkins is not the one to go to for an answer to these questions. That he hit upon a good question is no more remarkable than the fact that a stopped clock is right twice a day.<br /><br />In his chapter on morality, following a discussion of the conditions that favor the evolution of altruism and good morals, there is a subsection titled 'If there is no God, why be good?' The beginning of the chapter Dawkins gives examples of how angry people get at the idea of morality without religion. I'm angry too because he doesn't answer the question. The title of the section is a scam.<br /><br />Dawkins answers two similar questions: Does belief in God cause people to be good? Can you decide what is good without God? He also criticizes people who do good out of fear of God without, however, recommending the virtue of loving God:<br /><br />\\"When a religious person puts it to me in this way [title of the section] (and many of them do), my immediate temptation is to issue the following challenge: 'Do you really mean to tell me the only reason you try to be good is to gain God's approval and reward, or to avoid his disapproval and punishment? That's not morality, that's sucking up, apple-polishing, looking over your shoulder at the great surveillance camera in the sky, or the still small wiretap inside your head, monitoring your every move, even your every base thought.'\\" (p. 226)<br /><br />If you ask a religious person whey they are kind and honorable, you get an answer. If you ask the likes of Sigmund Freud and Richard Dawkins, there is no answer. To Freud's credit and Dawkins's shame, Freud admits he has no answer. Ernest Jones quotes Freud as follows:<br /><br />\\"When I ask myself why I have always behaved honorably, ready to spare others and to be kind whenever possible, and when I did not give up being so when I observed that in that way one harms oneself and becomes an anvil because other people are brutal and untrustworthy, then it is true, I have no answer.\\" (Sigmund Freud, 2:465)<br /><br />The God in the title of the book is not the God of metaphysics and reason. It is a personal God, one who satisfies our need to have a meaningful life, that is, the God of revelation. Dawkins says:<br /><br />\\"...I shall define the God Hypothesis more defensibly: there exists a super human, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it including us...Not surprisingly, since it is founded on local traditions of private revelation rather than evidence, The God Hypothesis comes in many versions.\\" (p. 32)<br /><br />I believe in God and have faith in God because of the \\"local traditions of private revelations.\\" I don't know if it is right to call it evidence since we are considering beliefs whose truth cannot be seen. Nor do I criticize anyone for not believing in revelation. Saying it is wrong not to believe would be an unfair criticism.<br /><br />But I do criticize Dawkins and say he is wrong because it is apparent from this book that he has simply assumed religion isn't true. There are many who make this assumption, unaware that it is just an assumption, but who keep their lack of faith to themselves and give faith to their children. Not only doesn't Dawkins believe, he believes those who believe are wrong and that mankind would be better off without religion.<br /><br />By way of refutation, I'd like to quote from a letter Saint Ambrose wrote to Emperor Theodosius in 390 AD after Roman troops massacred a big crowd of people, who happened to be in a stadium in Thessalonia, to retaliate against a protest of a tax increase that was already severely punished by the local authorities:<br /><br />\\"When it was first heard of, a synod had met because of the arrival of the Gallican Bishops. There was not one who did not lament it, not one who thought lightly of it; your being in fellowship with Ambrose was no excuse for your deed. Blame for what had been done would have been heaped more and more on me, had no one said that your reconciliation to our God was necessary.<br /><br />\\"Are you ashamed, O Emperor, to do that which the royal prophet David, the forefather of Christ, according to the flesh, did? To him it was told how the rich man who had many flocks seized and killed the poor man's one lamb, because of the arrival of his guest, and recognizing that he himself was being condemned in the tale, for that he himself had done it, he said: 'l have sinned against the Lord.' Bear it, then, without impatience, O Emperor, if it be said to you: You have done that which was spoken of to King David by the prophet. For if you listen obediently to this, and say: 'I have sinned against the Lord,' if you repeat those words of the royal prophet: 'O come let us worship and fall down before Him, and mourn before the Lord our God. Who made us,' it shall be said to you also: 'Since thou repentest, the Lord putteth away thy sin, and thou shalt not die.'\\" (Internet Medieval Sourcebook: Ambrose to Theodosius I 390 [Letter 51])<br /><br />Emperor Theodosius repented.ans he is not omnipotent.\\" (p. 78) <br /> <br />This is a new one on me.

B000001IQH|4.0|Like them or loathe them, Rancid is passionate about music. This album is 4 friends playing music they love and it ends up sounding like it.    Is it innovative or original? No... but the band puts their soul into this stuff and it gels quite well on this particular offering. If there's any doubt to my comments play \\"Journey to the End of East Bay\\" a few times in a row. My bet is that Mr. Tim Armstrong has not had a charmed life and this music is his outlet. His band made an enjoyable record here... it doesn't re-invent the wheel or significantly change the world for that matter, but it makes a long drive to work on a rainy Monday morning less dreary when you can sing along with these 4 guys and not have to hit the \\"skip\\" button...    So in a way it does change the world for the better.

B00000JBFW|5.0|The famous reunion album of 1984 by Deep Purple. The album known as Perfect Strangers is one of the best hard rock albums of the 1980's. It's a very enjoyable album, from a legendary group who had the guts to reform, and deliver the goods with a great album of new material.     I agree with some critics who say the Polydor version sounds better than the 1999 Mercury/Universal re-master. Such a good album needs to be remastered with love, or even a remix, so it can sound like it was recorded in the 21st century. Much like the 25th anniversary Machine Head release was.      Highlights: Under The Gun, Knockin' At Your Back Door, Perfect Strangers and Wasted Sunsets.
0792165020|5.0|This intriguing psychological drama stars Matt Damon as Tom Ripley, a poor piano player who meets a wealthy man, lies about being his son's friend, and is paid to go to Italy and bring the son home.  Once there, Tom befriends the young playboy, Dickie (Jude Law), and his girlfriend  (Gwyneth Paltrow) and begins living the high-life with them.  He loves everything about Dickie's privileged lifestyle, but complications arise when an American socialite (Cate Blanchette) and a nosey pal (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) start to crowd Tom.<br /><br />Anti-hero Tom Ripley is something of an innocent, while also being completely amoral.  He admits early on that he is a liar, forger, and impersonator, and those are some of his good qualities.  He commits an unspeakable act in a fit of passion, and finds himself buried deeper and deeper in a web of lies.  Matt Damon is convincing as Tom, but charismatic Jude Law steals the show as the spoiled golden boy, Dickie.  His American accent is just right and his scenes are the best in the movie.  Paltrow, Blanchette, and Hoffman give memorable performances, too.  The Italian locations are beautiful, and the intense script is full of twists and turns as Tom's dream of wealth is pursued, realized, and then threatened.  The story is complex, subtle, and shocking; I understand more with every viewing and like it more, too.  Highly recommended.
1400077915|5.0|Almost any of Alice Munro's long stories has as much humanity and as much development as most novels, but I suspect that her penchant for the story-collection format has unfairly limited her acclaim. She's my candidate for the most powerful contemporary writer in English. RUNAWAY is evidence that even when she repeats elements of older stories, she achieves new insights. Certainly her themes are limited to her own life experiences, but unlike many of us she has learned from life and has had the courage to rethink previous lessons. Don't get the idea that she's only for somber and serious readers; style alone is enough to make her an entertainer as well as a wisdom-sharer.
0140143505|5.0|In these days of e-books, and bland books constructed from franchised ideas and formulas, we are presented \\"84, Charing Cross Road,\\" a story about a relationship begun because of a mutual love of old great books.<br /><br />Frank Doel is the chief buyer at an English bookstore, and Helene Hanff mails him a request for a book. Correspondence and a relationship begins. Contently and confidently married, Doel responds as an older brother might, and the two grow to cherish each other despite the distance.<br /><br />As they care for each other, and slowly, their local friends and family become aware, we see how love transcends the sea.

0679731725|5.0|This book has a dreamlike quality as the narrator drifts easily through time with the tides of his memory.  The story is masterfully subtle and most of the story is told between the lines.  Haunting.
B00005JOQS|3.0|Ok i would give it 3.5 if I could. The good points are:    - Good story, the whole thing with leaving and coming back .. and how the world viewed the whole thing while superman was away is cool, also the almost dying stuff .. it's so close to the comic books way of story telling  - The action is great  - visually it's very good  - stayed true to the original series in terms of atmosphere, and general mood    The Bad Points:    -The dude is too much of a pretty boy to be Superman, he would make a great Superman son .. or a good younger superman brother .. who's playful and not as solemn as his older brother .. the Superman .. he's also too soft  - loius is too knock-out georgous in an eye-candy type of way, not in the assertive, attractive, go-getter, feisty reporter type of way. The actress struggles to portray that, but it's too hard to notice it past her looks, I mean the type of looks she has, especially that her acting skills don't over-ride the impression her looks give, in the same way .. say ... Charlize Theron's skills do  -Kevin spacy falls short of himself ... Lex Luthor is too unidimensional, I expected more from Kevin Spacy .. I feel that anybody could've done this Lex  -The suite .. there's something that's not clicking .. maybe it's the actor .. it just looks too soft, and the boots are horrible .. it's like Superman with kinky boots
0060977493|4.0|This novel is beautifully poetic.  You get the impression the the author is luxuriating in language as much as she is telling a story.  The characters have the strange quality of being both familiar and exotic, especially the children.  The book moves backward and forward as if gathering up the momentum for the ending, which is somehow both jarring and disturbing, despite the fact that you know it is coming.  Altogether, this is an incredible first novel.
B00005JPAD|4.0|This is a cop / Rat movie who is the rat who truley is the rat.  Let me start off by saying iam neither a fan of Leo nor Damon but suprinsingly they give good performances in this movie . However I would say that the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was for Scorsese having Damon and at parts Leo try there pathetic attempt of an Irish acent they both sound nothing like an Irishman. Jack the man Nicholson carried most of the movie on his shoulders with Jack your always going to get your comedy and you do here in this movie as well. Mark Walhberg  does the better acting out of Damon  and Leo trio, and plays his part to key and convinsingly.  The movie itself  I would give 5 stars I just cant get over the Damon and Leo Irish acent thing.   Jack is the head honcho mafia boss selling microchips to wanna be asian gangsters and Leo is working in his crew undercover . Damon is the head police guy or sergant something like that to bring down Jack.  Walhberg is one of only two people that know that Leo is undercover in Jack's crime orginization.  However there is a rat in the police station.  As a matter of fact there is two of them I wont spoil anyones fun like it was spoiled for me before I saw the movie so go and see the movie it is worth the money.
B000F5GO0A|5.0|I can't decide if this is happy music that sounds sad, or sad music that sounds happy. I am absolutely captivated by this cd. His haunting voice, unbelievably comforting and soothing though it's hard to understand a word of what he's singing. The instruments all blend very nicely together. It does get a little repetitive at times but oddly enough, at the end of the cd I'm craving more. Postcards From Italy is hands down the best track on the disc. But really there isn't one single song on this cd that I don't like. It's nice to come across something as catchy as this, that sounds different that the latest humdrum of our time. Cheers to this new artist. Looking forward to more!
B000GRUMPU|3.0|The film transfer of this disk is excellent. The DVD 'extras' focus on special effects work only.<br /><br />The movie itself has excellent effects however the main digital effect, the opening scenes of the SS Poseidon at sea with one of our heroes jogging around the decks, is technically top notch, unfortunately it's just not as good as real footage.<br /><br />The storyline is wham bam disaster movie fare with plenty of edge of your seat moments. But remember it's a thrill ride, not a thriller. When you get off the roller coaster, that's it. Still hat's off to the whole production team, the ride was exciting.
0618477942|2.0|This work was well-drawn, as is all of Bechdel's work.  It was also incredibly boring, kind of aimless, self-absorbed catharsis.  I also thought we'd get to know more about her father's life, thoughts, feelings...along with hers.<br /><br />I love her other stuff, but this rambling tome just wasn't for me.
B00005LB50|2.0|I've seen this group perform in person. They brought the house down.  I brought this box set hoping to get most of the music they did.  I was kinda dissappointed in the box set.  Why didn't they put in live tracks in the fourth CD.  Instead putting the same songs they had in the other CD's? You are better off in buying the single CD's, then spending the sixty dollars or so on this box set. Even though they only had a two year stint they had big influence in the music of that era and even today.
B000G759LW|5.0|At first I wasnt sure what to expect from Christina this time around but she gave me a HUGE surprise with Back to Basics. The first cd is just as good as the 2nd. I must say that the 2nd disc inspired me to go to church! LOL thats how good her vocals are. She is inspiring and proves that she belongs in the music industry for years to come. Good job
0780626966|4.0|I recently purchased the Nightmare on Elm Street Collection, and I love having not only the original movies but the final installment \\"New Nightmare,\\" the perfect swan song to the series. <br /> <br />However, I was a bit disappointed that the DVD collection is missing 2 very important things: the original theatrical trailers for the movies (if they're there I can't find them), and the \\"Freddy's Nightmares\\" short-lived television program. It only lasted for a few episodes, but I was really hoping to be able to see them again someday on DVD. One would think that a collection as thorough as this one would contain \\"Freddy's Nightmares\\" but sadly it doesn't.  <br /> <br />All in all, I would say this is a great buy for lovers of the \\"Nightmare\\" series!
B000BBOUU4|5.0|I saw Charlie & The Chocolate Factory last night for the first time (I'm behind the times, yes) and though I usually don't care very much in giving my opinion, the journey Tim Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.<br /><br />I have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it \\"reality\\" but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is all about... It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with \\"real\\" sets, \\"real\\" Oompas Loompas, \\"real\\" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film.<br /><br />After that, it's just emotions. All kinds of them: laughs (many - the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds), tears of joy (we all know Charlie's gonna find that ticket but when he does, you just can't refrain your heart to beat faster), mercy (the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket's family is really touching), amazement (the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder, one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us) and many mores. Very much like the book, even though it seems simple and childish, you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don't have the time. It just never stops (I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact). Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.<br /><br />Johnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won't compare with Gene Wilder since I don't know the first film very well (pretty unknown flick here in Europe) and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn't know much about common courtesy and doesn't really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he's pretty proud of it. He just doesn't want those \\"weird\\" (a word he likes - you've all seen the TV spots) and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet... So Depp's Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus, Vercua, Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them, you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that, John August's vision of Wonka's past (including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee) offers the character a real depth you didn't expect.<br /><br />Danny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic Burton/Elfman work with some interesting experiments (the main themes are splendid), the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don't intend tostay with you for months (it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses), they're just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it'll come out, it'll bring them back 15 years ago.<br /><br />What, can I tell you more? McDowell's sets are amazing, Pescucci's work is impressive as well as Rousselot's beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.<br /><br />As for the ending, without revealing it, August's additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton's new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the \\"family\\" theme that he developed through the film (it's still Burton, not Disney), Burton makes you feel good because he feels good (and what I'm writing here will ring a bell when you'll see the movie). I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films, it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father, he became one, he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions.<br /><br />Thank you, Tim Burton. Thank you very much.intend to stay with you for months (it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses), they're just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles.

0618680004|5.0|Obviously Dr. Dawkins does not write things that make typical summer reading. What he has said is about the unpalatable concept of atheism - a concept that goes against what we were ingrained or programmed to believe.  Hence to many, it may appear as non-sense - but that is their problem.  <br /> <br />This book presents a number of powerful arguments formulated to prove that the existence of God is improbable. It talks of the stuff that developed historically in the context of Western monotheistic religions, and has its clearest application in this area. And even in the modern Western context \\"atheism\\" has always meant different things depending on changing conceptions of God. However the book presents a set of arguments that have to be read open mindedly and applied cautiously outside the historical context of our beliefs. I have always found the concept of atheism extremely illuminating for any contemporary reader. <br /> <br />Even die hard believers have to accept that there no general definition of \\"God\\" so for ones own self we need to clear it out - and its extremely important - in order to have clear scientific understanding that there are a number of different concepts of God that people in society use interchangeably and these perceptions and image appear in controversies and debates about religion. <br />  <br />I have followed Dr. Dawkins ever since the beginning. He is the world's most controversial evolutionary biologist. His first book in 1976, \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" brought him into the public eye as the fine-looking, suave, hotheaded - a human face of scientific reductionist. As with this book, \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" also enkindled everything from indignation to mirth by contending that natural selection works its creative powers purely through genes, not through species or individuals. Dr. Dawkins maintains the fact that our genes made use of us. We animals exist for their preservation and are nothing more than their throwaway survival machines.  <br /><br />Dawkins went on to write on same base of things, his authorship amplified in subsequent publications as \\"The Blind Watchmaker,\\" \\"Unweaving the Rainbow\\" and \\"Climbing Mount Improbable\\", \\"The Ancestor's Tale.\\"  <br /> <br />The latest book: The God Delusion, talks about delusions people believe even there is complete absence of evidence. Religion if we introspect closely and honestly we would agree with him it is nothing more than a childhood delusions like the \\"imaginary friend\\" or non-existent bogeyman under the bed. The delusion of God also possesses us and grips us in its negative connotations.  <br /> <br />Dr Dawkins brilliantly argues that the rise of religious fundamentalism is dividing people around the world, while the dispute between \\"intell-igent design\\" and Darwinism \\"is seriously undermining and restricting the teaching of science\\".  <br /> <br />Though some of the discussion may require some heavy lifting but the clarity of the presentation makes it approachable and valuable to the novice as well as the academic. His books are a call to arms; they are manuals and manifestos both at the same time and grips like thrillers. Well done again, Sir ! <br />
B000FSME1A|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is a pure example of method filmmaking. It is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker. The art direction, editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable. What drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline, acting and inner message. The inner message evidently enough is that war is hell, or in other words, hell is war. Not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art. European filmmakers wouldn't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war. What is most interesting is that an American filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film's collaborators through the continuance of the film.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple and brief, adapted by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. Martin Sheen plays the role of Captain Willard, a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore. He has a mission and it is to capture a presumed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the Cambodian jungle. Throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences. The most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks. Robert Duvall's character Colonel Kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic American army brain: to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself. The children walk about the playground, oblivious to any danger. The helicopters come into view from the dawning sea; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water, we hear the helicopter's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack. Throughout the sequence we hear Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries'. It is method filmmaking. The starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing. Let's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which Sheen travels in, stop an innocent upcoming boat, suspecting them to be VietCongs and carrying artilleries. Then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity.<br /><br />This film has its famous moment, some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen. It doesn't require any intellectual understanding, although the film is intellectually remarkable. The American soldiers in the Vietnam War jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country, aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against. It was a war gone mad, like all other wars, without purpose or dignity. It was a pure act of humanity: to destroy and restore their own greedy needs. This is a film in which there is no saviour, where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed, anger, foolishness and egoism. As Coppola once said about the film: 'This film isn't about Vietnam. This film IS Vietnam'. He was right to the date. During the current situations of the world, where they are trying to protect their own skin, the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent. It is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation. It asks for realism.<br /><br />Enjoy.way from being inflamed with a carpet bombing.

B000HBKCDC|5.0|What can I say, I love Christmas music and Sarah Mclachlan crooning to them.  The recording is excellent.  Very little compression that I could hear, just like most of Sarah Mclachlan's albums.  Kudos to the production team.  The better your playback system, the better this album will sound.  Her voice is very warm and comforting, just what's needed to bring Christmas spirit out of everyone.  There is no weak song here.  Every song is distinctive with its own style.  Can't go wrong with this CD people.  BUY IT!!!
B00005RHGK|4.0|Trish and Darry Jenner are brother and sister coming back home via the back roads for the holiday break. Their journey is uneventful until they are terrorised by 'some jerk' in a beat up old truck - an event they get over until they later see the driver unloading what looks like bodies into a hole as they drive past. Escaping the ensuing chase, Darry insists they go back to see what he was doing - something he deeply regrets doing when he finds mutilated and preserved bodies all over the inside of the pit. They escape the truck again but their attempts to get help lead to nothing and they find themselves battling much more than the psycho driver that they first feared.<br /><br />This film was overly praised on its release because it was refreshingly free of the self-awareness and irony that many modern horrors had been full of since Scream. For my money though, the lack of irony didn't mean it would be a good horror movie and, not being good with the scary stuff at the best of times I decided to give it a miss. When it came on TV, I decided to give it a go even though I'm not really a fan of the teen horror genre. However this film is actually a lot better than the normal teen horrors because, like the critics said, it isn't full of the usual clich&eacute;s and so on. Instead the plot is a pretty tense and simple affair where we are only given two teens rather than a group that will slowly be picked off. The film is not terrifying but it is pretty creepy and has a good, consistent tone to it that is quite unnerving.<br /><br />The strength of the film is that it doesn't lose momentum when the creature is revealed; usually modern creature features lose a lot of their tension when the (usually CGI) beast is fully seen. Here we have several stages (truck/shadow/man/creepy man/beast) and they all are effective. Salva directs well and injects a good sense of tension into the film but he also knows how to frame a shot - his use of darkness and the tunnel spotlight effect both being pretty effective. Of course it is still just a horror movie and is not perfect but I must admit that I was drawn into it easily early on, even if it did tend to flag a bit as it progresses.<br /><br />Even though it is not strictly a teen horror, we still have to put up with two rather annoying teenagers in the lead role but I suppose that is to be expected from Salva - according to the courts he has worked with minors before! In fairness to both the actors in the lead roles, they do pretty well, managing to come across real when required (as opposed to fodder filler) but also seeming genuinely afraid. Both Phillips and Long were better than I expected and did well acting as the core of the film. The creature itself is also a good presence even if it does lose a little bit of its creepiness when the wings come out.<br /><br />Overall this was a surprisingly enjoyable horror movie but of course it is still a teen horror of sorts so don't assume that it will be perfect - it still does pretty much what you expect it to. Like the critics though, I enjoyed its lack of knowing cynicism and it did have a good sense of pace and tension even if it wasn't really 'horrifying'. Still a teen horror then, but one that is better than the norm and worth seeing if you like the genre.oth being pretty effective.

B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar Studios have done it again. I have to say that these guys are totally good in computer animation, as well as in storytelling. Rarely do those qualities come together but here they are, delivering unto the audience once again something that one can only be drowned with wonder. Such is the marvel of Finding Nemo.<br /><br />The story is about Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould), a young clownfish who is fed up with his dad Marlin's (Albert Brooks) excessive paranoia over him. He swims to a place where his dad forbids him and ends up being captured by a scuba diver. He is then placed in a fish tank in a dental clinic somewhere along the harbors of Sydney. Thus the quest of Marlin, along with Dory (a hilarious forgetful blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) to find Nemo before it's too late.<br /><br />The story is a simple one but where the film more than makes up is on the overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colors and textures as if we aren't really watching an animated film at all. Scenes such as Marlin bringing Nemo to school while swimming through corals and anemones, to the aquarium where Nemo was taken to, are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtedbly one of the most outstanding animation ever to hit the screen.<br /><br />The world of \\"Finding Nemo\\" is simply alive with lovable creatures swimming about their daily lives under the ocean, darting across the screen in playful manners. The viewer almost literally dives into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely captivated.<br /><br />The music and screenplay also blend very well with the visual feast that it produces such a high quality movie. From its basic storyline, to the father-and-son relationship theme, to the wonderful underwater world throughout, this is really an adventure through an ocean of stunning visuals and storytelling.<br /><br />Grade: A
0316172324|2.0|Gladwell writes well and the book is interesting. I read about half the book before I knew it! But I was jolted when Gladwell suddenly changed the focus of the book. In the first half of the book snap-judgments are good, then theyre suddenly bad. \\"What's up with that?\\" I asked myself.<br /><br />Well, what's up is people are programmed or brain-washed, if you will, to react however they react to specific stimuli. And how they react depends on their fund of experience with specific stimuli, or the messages society drums into their skulls. Phobias and aversion reactions and addictions are the extreme forms of such mental activity. Like peeing on an electric fence. One experience is enough. No need for college or a seminar or a cost-benefit analysis. And no need to suffer guilt for your prejudice against all electric fences. So you save money on counseling, too.<br /><br />Gladwell can improve the organization of the book by keeping the first half, which explains the benefits of snap-judgments, then address the issue of how to correct faulty snap-judgment decision making. That is, provide some helpful hints about how to reset the triggers to include new and better information.<br /><br />I was gonna buy the book and am mighty happy I didnt.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun Of The Dead isn't your typical zombie movie. In fact, the zombies don't truly enter the story until almost a third of the way in. So what's it really about? A man named Shaun, played by Simon Pegg, who lives in London and is a bit of a loser. He works in a dead-end job at an electronic goods store and spends most of his spare time at the local pub or playing video games with his unemployed roomate, Ed. One day Shaun's girlfriend, Liz, decides she's had enough of his lazy attitude and decides to leave him. When the city suddenly gets taken over by the living dead Shaun finds the perfect opportunity to prove himself to Liz, so he sets out to save the day, win his girlfriend back and keep his mum, Barbara, from being eaten by his step-dad who's slowly turning into a zombie.<br /><br />Don't let the title and premise fool you, this isn't a simple spoof of Dawn Of The Dead, it's more a romantic comedy that just so happens to be littered with the undead. The film is also very clever, with a clear social commentary running throughout. The jokes that stem from this are absolutely hilarious but will probably be lost on any non-Londoners. It's actually quite unlikely that this film will translate to anyone outside the UK and this is a real shame and perhaps the films biggest flaw. But if you do get it, then good for you, because there is a lot of great stuff to be seen here. The script is wonderful and throws up many comedic moments, such as when Shaun and Ed are looking through Shaun's LP collection for a suitable vinyl to throw at two oncoming zombies, \\"Dire Straits?\\" \\"Chuck it!\\", or when Shaun and his friends beat up an elderly zombie in the pub using cricket bats, all to the rhythm of Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. The humour comes thick and fast, never have I laughed so consistantly during any film before, it only pauses briefly for a few dramatic scenes, all of which work surprisingly well. In fact the film tends to genre-hop quite a lot, and while some find this unappealing I think it works in its favour. One minute it's a comedy, then it's a drama and then it's a full blown horror. In fact some scenes are quite jumpy and certainly violent. One extremely gory part in particular is a clear homage to another famous horror film that shall remain unamed, but if you know what I'm talking about when you see it then good for you. That's the thing about this movie though, you don't need to be a horror fan to enjoy it. You just need to have the right sense of humour. Can I explain it? Well, no. You'll just know if the film's for you when you see it. I can assure you that most will like it. If you don't, then I really am sorry for you as this is about the most fun I have had in the cinema since Kill Bill . Ok, that wasn't long ago, but before that I don't think there was a film that was so rip-roaringly funny and then unashamedly brutal at the same time. There is nothing subtle about this movie, and yet it will simply go over the heads of most people. I urge you to watch the film and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it.

It's funny, it's clever and it's got zombies in it! Just when the British film industry appears to be dead this gem pops up and shows us what someone with a sense of humour and a real passion for the media can achieve. Go watch it, you'll laugh till it hurts!nappealing I think it works in its favour. One minute it's a comedy, then it's a drama and then it's a full blown horror. In fact some scenes are quite jumpy and certainly violent. One extremely gory part in particular is a clear homage to another famous horror film that shall remain unamed, but if you know what I'm talking about when you see it then good for you. That's the thing about this movie though, you don't need to be a horror fan to enjoy it. You just need to have the right sense of humour. Can I explain it? Well, no. You'll just know if the film's for you when you see it. I can assure you that most will like it. If you don't, then I really am sorry for you as this is about the most fun I have had in the cinema since Kill Bill . Ok, that wasn't long ago, but before that I don't think there was a film that was so rip-roaringly funny and then unashamedly brutal at the same time. There is nothing subtle about this movie, and yet it will simply go over the heads of most people. I urge you to watch the film and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it. It's not without its faults though, losing its spark slightly during the third act but it comes back with a vengence and gets in some really good jokes just before the credits roll. <br /> <br />Shaun Of The Dead is a great film.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|This cd is one of the best follow up cd's i have ever heard! Amy's voice is awsome and the guitars and drums are awsome also. I love this cd!!!! I give this cd 10 stars it is so good! This is not elavator music at all...
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I was sitting up late Saturday night and turned it to Soundstage already in progress. I saw Buddy Guy on stage playing with this young guy I had never seen. I became enthralled with the performances but I never caught his name. So afterwards I looked up the Soundstage tv schedule and found out it was John Mayer. Did some further checking and found out about his turn toward the blues, and I love blues. Took a chance and bought the cd next day. Best music I've bought in a long time. No, it's not straight blues. But it's definitely honest. And in this day and time of kitsch glorification, I'll take it. I feel like my money was well spent. Can't say that for a whole lot of things I've bought.
B000002OVJ|5.0|I'm not particularly impressed by CD releases of old stuff. But having seen the Who twice at Tanglewood in Lenox Mass about the time of Tommy I can vouch for the feracity of their playing. Heaven and Hell they opened with in one show and I always wondered why it wasn't released. After seeing Entwistle with dual Sunn amps and a Fender bass I was led to buy a 2000S and Precision myself and played for quite a while with this combination. They had it right back then and even though the openers were  BB King, Jefferson Airplane, Jethro Tull in either venue,they remain the greatest live band in my mind. Just watching Keith Moon do a rim shot and blow his stick into the air and catch it on the way down without blowing the song was worth the price of admission for me. This album brings it all back.
B000002U3P|4.0|In a world where every other movie has it's own soundtrack, few stand out. This one does to me. Obviously a liking for the movie helps, but even without the film this is an excellent listen. A great mix of old and new, mellow and upbeat. I mean when you stick Iggy, Lou Reed, and New Order on the same disc as Brian Eno, Blur, and Bedrock.....well you can't go wrong. Still a great play ten years later, and should be found cheap anyplace.
B000002OZY|5.0|I am a major fan of The Who and have been since their debut lp in 1965....however....while this may be considered the first rock opera ....it is NOT the first rock concept album.<br /><br />The Cryan' Shames...a local Chicago band who recorded on the Columbia label released a concept album in June, 1967 following The Beatles masterpiece of Sgt Pepper released in June, 1966. I would actually consider the latter to be more accurately defined as the FIRST rock opera...as all the tunes tied together in the main theme of the album, while also keeping with the recorded FEEL of the overall project.  The Cryan' Shames album also followed that same technique...unfortunately, it wasn't given the same national exposure.  The only real difference between Tommy and the other 2 releases....Tommy contained an overture.. underture and a climax at the end..which would be in keeping with an opera.<br /><br />I am NOT in any way underrating this fine album....by no means.....I am just pointing out that other artists made similar projects at an earlier point in time.
0812550757|4.0|Having loved Ender's Game I decided to continue on and read Speaker for the Dead. I have to admit to some mixed feelings about the book. What kept me reading it till the end, sometimes intensely so, is classic Card: His wonderful imagination (even though there's practically no action you still want to see what happens next), piercing insights into human nature and wise philosophical musings all wrapped in the easy to digest \\"fun\\" media of an escapist Sci-Fi novel. If you're an Orson Scott Card fan you won't be disappointed by Speaker for the Dead.  <br /> <br />The thing I didn't really like was that it seemed such a huge break from the world of Ender's Game, taking place 3,000 years in the future from Ender's Game, with Ender having spent most of that time just lightspeeding about the \\"Hundred Worlds\\" so that he's only 35 years old. It's like an entirely new world, entirely new series of books. It also lacked action. Nonetheless the world of the Piggies and the mystery of the \\"Descolada\\" virus were intriguing to explore, and Ender's philosophy was also interesting - although at times people seemed to go along with him just because he spoke the truth, and after saying one line people who hated him were suddenly his devotee. In a sense he seemed too powerful and things too easy for him. These things make it three stars next to Ender's Game.  <br /> <br />But how could you not award a constellation star for a book that actually has the following line (middle of page 371.)  <br /> <br />\\" . . . I knew her so well that I loved her, or maybe I loved her so well that I knew her. I didn't want to fight her anymore. I wanted to quit. I wanted to go home. So I blew up her planet.\\"  <br />
B000GRUS22|2.0|Enigma always was enigma bcause of this samples enigmatics ,gregorians ,africans voices ,thats why enigma was good ,this is not enigma music this is eurodance or trance or what ever and enigma is not the king in this type of music ,so I dont think this is a good Enigma's CD ,I think this is a little better than Voyageur CD ,but is not enigma anymore .the must beautiful song is Goodbye Milky way .. the music is not bad at all ,but it is not enigma's music .this is a different thing.
0812550706|5.0|Not having read Sci-Fi since I was a kid (and that pretty much limited to the Timothy Zahn Star Wars and Conqueror's series, which were awesome) I was a bit hesitant to read this book. My sister had read it enjoyed it immensely (and she's NO sci-fi fan) and in some training I had come across a large number of Marine Corps Junior Officers who had read it as part of their OCS reading list. Intrigued by how a book could cast so wide a net with its enthusiastic readers and having about a week of free time to unwind I picked it up, momentarily tired of reading dire history and current events. Two days later I was very happy I had done so.  <br /> <br />I won't go into plot or spoilers since you can read that from other reviews. What struck me about this book was Orson Scott Card's completely intuitive and amazingly correct understanding of warfare, competition, and humanity. This understanding, combined with an extremely active imagination and a captivating, page turning writing style made Ender's Game a quick and fun read, an excellent escape from the real world. However it is an escape with a good deal of merit as Card has a lot of wisdom that he conveys about human nature and the character of our struggles, and he breaches a lot of philosophical issues with insight that will actually make you think.  <br /> <br />Although geared towards a younger audience, there's a lot of good stuff in this book for people of any age. Last, it has a steady pace of action which kept me hooked, enjoying Sci-Fi novels where as much blows up as possible . . .
0618680004|1.0|Mr. Dawkins prides himself on being an \\"intellectually satisfied atheist\\" however what he fails to realize is that intellectual satisfaction doesn't amount to anything if one is spiritually dead.  He seems to be stuck in a 200 year-old mindset, harking back to a time when the scientific and religious views of the world were actively antagonistic and wholly incompatible-- even going so far as to claim that modern science has provided a basis for dismissing both God and religion altogether.<br /><br />And yet, apparently unbeknownst to him, many of the elite scientists of the last 100 years-- Planck, Heisenberg, de Broglie, Einstein, Oppenheimer, Schrodinger, Eddington, Jeans, Pauli, Davies, and many others-- actively endorsed an underlying religious/mystical point of view as the essential backbone of a good scientist, were acutely aware of the inability of the scientific method to answer the deeper metaphysical questions or provide anything close to a complete account of reality and, in many cases, saw their scientific work as, while not vindicating religion per se, decidedly making it possible for a scientific picture of the world to be /consistent/ with it.  Science can tell us about the laws that operate in the external world, but it can say nothing at all about who we really are, whence we came, whither we are going and to what we owe the drive within us for knowledge and understanding that underlies all scientific endeavour and is the true seat and source of all religious experience.  Natural science deals exclusively with the objective external world.  This means that it is powerless in principle to explain our subjective conscious awareness, the one thing we can't be skeptical of and the ultimate source of all religious feeling, experience and spiritual understanding.  This very sentiment once prompted none other than Erwin Schrodinger to lament that \\"the scientific picture of the real world around me is very deficient. It gives a lot of factual information, puts all our experience in a magnificently consistent order, but it is ghastly silent about all and sundry that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us\\".  Science is a powerful tool, no doubt, but it can at most tell us a fraction of the story.  The other, arguably the more important half-- which consists of an inner world of self-consciousness, conscience, beauty, form and spiritual yearning-- is fundamentally subjective and therefore strictly outside the scope of natural science.  This isn't to say that the two are necessarily at odds--far from it--rather, both are necessary for a complete picture.  Einstein himself, who wrote often that the \\"cosmic religious feeling\\" was the ultimate motivator for any true scientist once stated that \\"religion without science is lame, science without religion is blind\\".<br /><br />Regarding Dawkins' claims that science has rendered religion obsolete, consider the following words of Max Planck, founder of quantum theory, spoken during his Nobel Prize acceptance speech: \\"As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear-headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research into atoms this much. There is no matter, as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of the atom to vibration. I must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter\\" and the following passage by Cambridge physicist Sir James Jeans: \\"Today there is a wide measure of agreement which, on the physical side of science, approaches almost to unanimity that the stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than a great machine. Mind no longer appears as an accidental intruder into the realm of matter; we are beginning to suspect that we ought rather to hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter-- not, of course, our individual minds, but the mind in which the atoms out of which our individual minds have grown to exist as thoughts...The new knowledge compels us to revise our hasty first impressions that we had stumbled into a universe which either did not concern itself with life or was actively hostile to life. The old dualism of mind and matter, which was mainly responsible for the supposed hostility, seems likely to disappear, not through matter becoming in any way more shadowy or insubstantial than heretofore, or through mind becoming resolved into a function of the working of matter, but through substantial matter resolving itself into a creation and manifestation of mind.\\"  Hardly words of men who feel they are putting nails in the coffin of religion, and it's going to take more than the aggressive fanaticism Richard Dawkins to convince me otherwise.<br /><br />Dawkins wants us to believe that evolutionary theory gives us reason to dismiss the notion of an underlying intelligence to nature.  That's ridiculous.  For one thing, to echo David Berlinski's sentiment, not even a thimble can come into being without the aid of intelligent guidance-- why should the most efficient and complex structures in existence in the universe be any different?  This statement, though rhetorically compelling, doesn't settle the issue-- but fear not, despite what Dawkins would have you believe, the intelligent design theorists are precisely correct when they observe that the developments in biology throughout the last 50 years, with the revealing of complex cellular machines, layer after layer of irreducible complexity and the unfathomable magnitude of genetic information required for DNA to function overwhelmingly speak against the fundamental Darwinian assumption that evolution is an ultimately blind and unguided process.  That Dawkins, a man who is regarded by many as an important spokesperson for the scientific community, can fail utterly to see this, in spite of the numerous gaping holes that have been repeatedly poked through all of his arguments and that, regarding religion, he can speak so arrogantly, aggressively and above all dismissively about matters (and no light matters at that) where his understanding is so profoundly shallow and spurious-- is frightening, irritating and downright shameful.<br /><br />I will close with a quote from philosopher Thomas Nagel that I feel is especially pertinent here:<br /><br />\\"I speak from experience, being strongly subject to this fear myself: I want atheism to be true and am made uneasy by the fact that some of the most intelligent and well-informed people I know are religious believers. It isn't just that I don't believe in God and, naturally, hope that I'm right in my belief. It's that I hope there is no God! I don't want there to be a God; I don't want the universe to be like that...[Fear of religion may be] responsible for much of the scientism and reductionism of our time.\\", but the mind in which the atoms out of which our individual minds have grown to exist as thoughts...The new knowledge compels us to revise our hasty first impressions that we had stumbled into a universe which either did not concern itself with life or was actively hostile to life.

B000GRUS22|4.0|I completely agree with ROCKET's review. At first I said, \\"ehh, its OK.\\" But as I listened again and again, with a good sound system, I was addicted. I still feel its not as good as their first four albums--with their mysterious ethnic chants and haunting sounds--but definitely better than their last.
B000002G7G|5.0|Although not quite as utterly phenomenal as their peerless debut, and hardly comparable to the abrasive sonic assault of White Light/White Heat, the Velvet's epynomous third album does indeed stand up on its understated, simple, yet hauntingly poignant set of folk and garage inspired rock/pop. Despite their avant-garde inclinations, most of Lou Reed and Co's (of course this being the first album without John Cale) songs were still elementally 'pop' - with recogniseable song structures, melodies.etc. This probably refines and simplifies that which was glimpsed at in the Velvet Underground and Nico.  <br /> <br />It is a credit to the consistent high quality of this album that there are no REAL standouts, like in other albums of the era (the Doors great debut comes to mind, despite its overall greatness). 'Candy Says' is an absolute chestnut - few songs are as poignant, yet as relievingly unsentimental. Then there's 'What Goes On', Some Kinds of Love, Jesus. Murder Mystery is probably a bit over the top, and can get too long after awhile, while the others continue the general theme - that between raw underground rock'n'roll, and folk dipped in black tar, a faithful document of the avant-garde underground of 60s New York.

8489367116|5.0|One finds a book like SHANTARAM only a few times a year, if they are lucky. I thought my last read, THE KITE RUNNER, would be a hard-to-follow \\"great\\" book, but SHANTARAM kept me on a reading high for a month. Having lived in INDIA, I can attest that Mr. Roberts descriptions of INDIA and her people are right on. What more can a story do than carry you on its back and take you for a fantastic ride, leaving you on a reader's high that makes you believe that great literature can still be written, and that a man's story can truly be remarkable.
078324228X|4.0|I've heard a lot good and a lot bad about this film.  I don't think anyone can deny the power in Denzel's brilliant performance, but as far as the accuracy of the film is concerned, it's been judged harshly for it.  I personally don't know the truth behind this mans conviction, his innocence and his quilt, only he knows, but the portrait painted by this film portrays Rubin `The Hurricane' Carter as a victim of a corrupt system.  To me it's a very moving film, regardless if it's true or not, and in the eyes of the actors involved it truly grips and draws you into this mans fight for freedom.  Denzel delivers his finest performance here; a well deserved Oscar nomination, and proves that he is a very talented actor.  I am a fan of Denzel, although I've made my concern very clear (the fact that Denzel at times seems to only excel when playing these types of characters), and I feel he shines here.  Despite the constant criticism, I feel this is a must-see film, if not for the emotional, albeit somewhat fictionalized (or assumed is a better word since no one really knows), story then for the brilliant acting on the part of everyone involved.  Dan Hedeya does a great job as the crooked (fictional) detective who makes it his life goal to punish Rubin for a crime he committed as a child (a crime that should never have been considered a crime) and Vicellous Reon Shannon does wonderfully as Lesra, the young man who not only fights for Rubin's freedom but helps Rubin to regain the hope and life he once had.  Like I said, very heartwarming and touching, and regardless of whether or not Rubin was guilty or innocent, the basic story of his fight for survival and the love and support he received from Lesra and his companions is true and that act of human love and spirit is a joy to see.
0316172324|4.0|The Salon review of this book makes a remark that Gladwell's mission is to be entertaining, and not useful. I think that if you read this book in the spirit of that remark, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Blink is a great book to while away a few hours on a plane or train without feeling as though you are killing your brain cells with junk reading. It has the effect of listening to a really gifted cocktail party conversationalist string together a number of smart stories in search of a common theme. It doesn't quite work, but it is really impressive when it lasts, and darned fun to listen.<br /><br />Blink is amiable and entertaining. It admittedly fails to really build a case for a cohesive scientific thesis on thin slicing and subconscious decision-making. However, given its slim 254 pages and the wide range of stories that it contains, I would argue that it was always meant to give an impression of the subject rather than to be conclusive.<br /><br />Like I said, a good read if you go in expecting the right things.
B00003CXWV|4.0|Blow portrays the life and times of one George Jung, a real-life drug dealer currently serving a long prison sentence and not eligible for parole until 2015.  Ted Demme presents Jung's life as a series of montages, growing up in Massashusetts son of a hard-working man and a shrewish wife, moving to California with a childhood friend and becoming immersed in the marijuana trade, serving a stint in jail and meeting a Columbian who introduces him to cocaine, working his way up in Pablo Escobar's Medellin cartel and making more money than he can spend, betrayal by his colleagues and leaving the business, busted again with large amounts of cocaine in his house during his 38th birthday party, out of jail making amends with his daughter, doing one last job so he can retire to California with his daughter, getting busted yet again and sentenced to 60 years.  It's hard to tell how much of the stroy is real and how much is a product of George Jung's imagination, but in the end Demme had no choice but to trust Jung's portrayal of his life.  To Demme's credit (and maybe Jung's) the movie doesn't deify Jung's life.  He made his decisions for whatever reasons good or bad.  We can guess what his motivations were, and decide whatever we want to about his decisions.  In the end, Jung's life is yet another largely wasted by drugs.  Whatever your opinions are on drugs, this movie's portrayal of Jung's life is largely neutral on the political questions.  That's one reason I rate it so highly.  It doesn't glamorize drugs, nor does it make any judgements on the penalties that Jung ends up getting because of his involvement in the drug trade. <br /> <br />George Jung is played masterfully by Johnny Depp.  Is there any question who is the best actor of his generation?  Depp is brilliant in this movie.  Ray Liotta is superb as Depp's father as well.  The rest of the cast was good except for Penelope Cruz's incoherent portrayal of George Jung's drug addled wife. <br /> <br />The movie coversa lot of ground and lacks some of the detail you might expect because of it.  But it's a well made, thoughtful and haunting movie that will stick with me for awhile. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this one if you are looking for something a little different than your average Hollywood fare.

B000E6UK5K|1.0|I found this album to be a waste of time and money... not what I expected from a guitar god. Not much energy and muddled lyrics. Not at all Pink Floyd type effort. As a Floyd fan and having been to several Floyd concerts as well as seeing David's solo concert I am saddend to see David produce such drivel. 1 star for nice packaging.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|To answer the previous question : the standard version of this box set has two discs (a customer allready gave the tacklisting for those). There will be a special-collector (or anyway you want to call it) version with a bonus disc. But it's still hard to say what will be found on that one. Some say it will include seven tracks from the 1977 Madison Square Garden show. Others that there will be three different bonus discs from different shows (that wouldn't surprise me-the Kiss fanatics will have to purchase three of those box sets to get the whole thing, hey, it's Kiss and they know how to make you spend your money). But if the tracks are really unedited, the two-discs version will have way enough to satisfy even the most dedicated Kiss fan. Can't wait to get my hands on that monster. And excuse my poor english, but I'm still learning it.
B000GY729M|4.0|The Killers' debut album, \\"Hot Fuss,\\" was such a phenomenon that it was nearly impossible to follow-up with something as good. Well, the Killers have tried and delivered \\"Sam's Town.\\" For their second album, the foursome goes for a more rock-oriented approach, leaving behind much of the glam/disco undertones of the previous album. Is it better? Judge for yourself. One thing is for sure, though: It's different.<br /><br />Sounds like: Queen, Bruce Springsteen and the Cars rolled into one.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- They don't try to repeat themselves here. There are moments that somewhat callback to the first album, but for the most part, they took a real risk.<br /><br />- The production and musicianship are much stronger than before.<br /><br />- The album doesn't peter out on the second half like \\"Hot Fuss\\" did.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- Unfortunately, nothing here really leaves quite the impression that the strongest tracks on \\"Hot Fuss\\" did.<br /><br />Hits: \\"When You Were Young,\\" \\"For Reasons Unknown,\\" \\"This River Is Wild,\\" and \\"Bones.\\"<br /><br />Misses: \\"Uncle Johnny\\" a song that sticks out like a sore thumb and doesn't seem to go anywhere.<br /><br />Future: \\"Sam's Town\\" most likely won't be the massive hit it's predecessor was, but at the very least, the Killers have proven they aren't just a flash in the pan or a one-trick pony.<br /><br />Personally: There's nothing here that gives me the chills that half of \\"Hot Fuss\\" did, which is surprising. But the album is still good to listen too, especially where the first album is starting to sound a bit stale at this point.<br /><br />Best Listened To When: \\"Hot Fuss\\" goes cold.
B000GUJHD0|4.0|I toally aggree that pattern recognizers and somebody who can see the big picture will lead the world. Right-brain activity adds color and mystry to our lives while left-brain activity let us understand why things they are. But fundamentally one has to have strong L-Directed skills to excel on anything at all. The L-Directed skills can be aquired later at life but R-Directed skills are more of natural. The book make us feel like if we all go persuit those R-Directed skills, we will all better off. To me, in the real world, it is only for thos ones who already master R-brain skills and happend to have some L-Brain potentials which has not been exploired.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah Mclachlan's new holiday album, 'Wintersong' is a wonderful collection of old classics and more contemporary pop tracks. The whole sound on the record is very Sarah-esque with lots of atmosphere and harmonies. Her voice is as strong and emotive as ever; For proof, check out The First Noel/Mary Mary. My personal favorites are her original track, Wintersong, her cover of Happy XMas (War is Over), and the aforementioned The First Noel/Mary Mary. I'll Be Home For Christmas is very bluesy and Sarah sounds great with this different delivery style. And although Song For a Winter's Night is an old Sarah cover it has been remastered with some additional guitar added and it sounds fabulous. This CD will be in my player all during the holidays to keep me in a holiday spirit!
B00005JPAD|4.0|\\"You don't make up for your sins in Church; you do it on the street; everything else is __________ and you know it\\"  - from MEAN STREETS (1973) directed by Martin Scorsese        Of all sins - deception proves the most elusive of absolution; for it is through lies and lying that Satan seeks man's ruination. Such is the world of former- seminary-student-turned-film director Martin Scorsese- who has been setting morality fables in brutal urban streets for almost 40 years.        Violent, profane, rife with obsidian-black humor and, as with all Scorsese pictures, set to a soundtrack of classic rock music THE DEPARTED is filled with countless deceitful, plague-carrying rats (both literal and figurative).         Through Scorsese's lens, no one is completely innocent. All characters carry the guilt of mendacity and all must serve a penance. For most this includes blood atonement.        THE DEPARTED, Scorsese's latest meditation on the nature of sin and sinning, unfolds in the rotting bureaus of Irish South Boston and depicts two spies (artists of deception) one working for the police, another working for the mob.        Employing long, sweeping steadicam as well as tracking and crane shots Scorsese's camera bottles lightening with an expert cast working at the top of their collective games. Playing alongside wily veterans Martin Sheen and Alex Baldwin, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg all deliver some of their finest, most nuanced work.         Jack Nicholson, playing a graying and wrinkled Satan chews the scenery complete with an authentic \\"Southie\\" accent. Save for couple of scenes in which he gives a grotesque- pain inducing self-parodic imitation of himself, Nicholson reminds us he is one of America's artistic treasures.         And so is director Martin Scorsese, who after stepping away from his comfort zone, returns to his greatest strength- telling contemporary stories about sinners paying for their sins on the streets.
B000G73UEU|4.0|Taken from several concerts that were collected into the 'I'm Your Man' documentary, the disc features many decent to great covers of classic Leonard Cohen tracks. Some of the highlights are Antony's soaring, operatic rendition of 'If It Be Your Will', Teddy Thompson's takes on 'Tonight Will Be Fine' and 'The Future', and Nick Cave's satanic crooner take on the title track. The McGarrigle sisters do a chilling 'Winter Lady', which fits into the folkier performed songs here, but it's nice to hear the artists expiriment a bit. Brett Sparks from The Handsome Family handles 'Famous Blue Raincoat' well, while going flat a few times, still adds his unique touch that he does to his own excellent music. I know Rufus Wainwright has many fans, but I found his voice to be a nasally drone and rather irritating, yet his 'Chelsea Hotel No. 2' cover far outshines his other submission. <br /> <br />All around, a good album of with some strong covers and a great companion for the film.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Yes - it's only October, but thanks to the musical angel that is Sarah McLachlan, I am already in the Christmas spirit.  Sarah doesn't necessarily break any new ground with this album (in fact, I'm a little dissapointed that she decided to throw \\"Song for a Winter's Night\\" on here in lieu of another original .. . but oh well) - but what she does manage to do is lend her gorgeous singing voice and mellow piano/guitar sounds to some Christmas favourites - and she does them very, very well.  No way can you say \\"Bah Humbug\\" to this CD.  It's absolutely gorgeous!
B000065V9Y|3.0|Peter Gabriel was pretty big at the end of the 1980s. In 1986, he released his most commercially successful album, SO, which became a megahit with critics and audiences alike; in 1989, he released PASSION, an expanded version of his soundtrack for Martin Scorsese's controversial 1988 drama THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, which is widely considered to be Gabriel's finest achievement. Gabriel fans know that the former Genesis frontman likes to take his time in the studio, and he did take his time in releasing a follow-up to SO. That follow-up was finally released in 1992 as US. It was nowhere near as successful as SO, but over time, fans have come to see US as a gem in the Gabriel catalogue; some even call it his best.  <br /> <br />While SO really didn't have a central concept weaving the songs together, US does: relationships. Around the time that he was working on US, Gabriel was having some major relationship problems. He and his longtime wife Jill, whom he met as a teenager, seperated. He had a turbulent romance with Rosanna Arquette. Reportedly, he even had a brief romance with Sinead O'Connor (whose beautiful voice appears on the first and third tracks of US). To make matters worse, Gabriel's teenage daughter had stopped communicating with him. It wasn't an easy time for Gabriel, and US reflects that. Gabriel bares his heart and soul, working out his emotional problems through his music. Sounds like it would make a great album, doesn't it? It certainly did to me. That's why I was a little taken aback when I decided that US is, in fact, Gabriel's weakest album.  <br /> <br />The album gets off to a great start with the comforting \\"Come Talk To Me\\", inspired by the rift that had appeared between Gabriel and his daughter. It has the tribal drumming found on previous Gabriel albums like SECURITY, as well as the ethereal synthesizers that appeared in songs like \\"In Your Eyes\\". It may be one of Gabriel's best songs, but the subsequent composition, \\"Love To Be Loved\\",is not. The lyrics are simplistic and pointless (the bulk of the song finds Gabriel repeating, \\"I love to be loved\\" - but who doesn't?), and the music is too calm and unoriginal to really excite the listener. That's the problem with many of the songs on US: they just never take off.  <br /> <br />\\"Blood Of Eden\\" is one of the better songs on US. It's about trying to use sex to work through relationship problems. It's during sex that two people are at their closest spiritually, and \\"Blood Of Eden\\" is about a couple trying to get back to that place. After this song, Gabriel does something he's done on just about all of his albums: he throws in a song to lighten things up. On US, that song is \\"Steam\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Steam\\" has been criticized for being nothing but a carbon copy of SO's number one hit \\"Sledgehammer\\". Unfortunately, that's true; people may recognize the same sexually-suggestive lyrics, thick drumming, bouncing guitar, and motown-style horns that made \\"Sledgehammer\\" so great. Still, I don't think people give \\"Steam\\" the credit it deserves. It succeeds in lightening up the album, if only for one song, and it is great fun. I, for one, love it.  <br /> <br />\\"Only Us\\" is another song that never really takes off, followed by what may be the dullest song of Gabriel's career, \\"Washing Of The Water\\". \\"Digging In The Dirt\\", however, is a great song, and possibly the finest on US. The song was written about Gabriel's experiences during psychiatric sessions, during which the psychiatrist apparently dug through the \\"dirt\\" in Gabriel's mind to reveal the emotions trapped within. \\"Digging In The Dirt\\" is a rare and very enjoyable glimpse at Gabriel's dark side, and it really adds some much-needed texture to the album.  <br /> <br />\\"Fourteen Black Paintings\\" is a good, atmospheric song, though at times it feels like a leftover from PASSION. \\"Kiss That Frog\\" is another attempt at lightening the mood, and again, it works. It's one of Gabriel's silliest compositions, butit's undeniably fun. (The odd music video featured some now-cringeworthy CGI and was directed by cult director Brett Leonard.) The album closes on a hopeful note with \\"Secret World\\" (which wound up as the title of Gabriel's second live album), one of the album's better songs.  <br /> <br />Repeated listens reveal that US is far from a bad album, but it can't compare to some of Gabriel's other recordings. The songs all seem sort of muddled, forming a textured album that occasionally teeters on blandness. Luckily, US' highlights are good enough to make up for a few of the less-exciting songs on the album. After the release of US, Gabriel released a 2-CD live recording and then disappeared until briefly surfacing in 2000 to record OVO, the soundtrack to the Millennium Show in London, and then LONG WALK HOME, the soundtrack to RABBIT-PROOF FENCE a few years later. Gabriel didn't release another true album until ten years after the release of US; that album was UP, and it turned out to be one of Gabriel's best recordings. US is Gabriel's weakest album, and though it's not a bad album, I would recommend that you investigate some of Gabriel's other albums first.
0446677450|2.0|RICH DAD, POOR DAD seems contradictory in more than one way:  economically and philosophically.  Probably, Kiyosaki's most inviting, yet deceptive, chapter is Eight, \\"Overcoming obstacles.\\"  Here, he is at his most fervent; one can feel he believes what he is writing is true.  But it is not necessarily true about life itself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he confuses happiness with the gathering of money--what he calls \\"having money work for you\\"--while you engage in other pleasures of life, even if they are finanacial, also.<br /><br />He assumes people don't like to work to make a living.  There are farmers of all sorts that love their work, artists who thrill at their creations, designers, crafts people--and the list goes on--even though they may or may not be \\"middle class,\\" which he grudgingly \\"respects.\\" There are people who are satisfied to simply have their needs met (including health insurance, a vacation) and no more.<br /><br />In his schemes, he wins, but the other guy or business loses--and in his twisted logic he thinks he has done them a favor.<br /><br />Acquiring money is a \\"game\\" he says, which can be played with some common sense--\\"common sense\\" if you have educated yourself in the field of real estate, finance, his and others' tapes and books and seminars--and aligned yourself with those who already have the my-goal-in-life-is-to-get-rich philosophy.<br /><br />There is a slickness to his humble presentation; I just can't pin it down.  What is amazing about his book (and subsequent ones, I'm told) is that he craftily gives you just enough to want to know more so you will buy follow-up tapes, books, videos and games.  Yet, he sounds so altruistic.<br /><br />Forgive me (no, don't), but I don't really believe there was a rich and poor \\"dad,\\" but that this was his platform on which to organize his book/s.  No way is he going to remember from early childhood what both his \\"dads\\" said to the point of quoting lengthy conversations.  (This point has been made by others, too.)<br /><br />Through most of the book he advocates spending money for both education and investments (especially real estate), but on page 195 he states, \\"The idea that it takes money to make money is the thinking of financially unsophisticated people.\\"  I think I understand the contexts of the former and the latter and this seems a contradiction.

B00006LI4S|5.0|I was very pleased while watching this DVD and consider it to be one of the best live performances offered on DVD of Floyd/Gilmour material. It's about time Dave assembled true musicians to back him for an acoustic/symphonic style show. We have all seen and heard the powerful super shows of the 80's and 90's concerts Delicate Sound of Thunder and Pulse; both of which I experienced live and loved very much. But this is something more subtle and reveals the accuracy and delivery of the music in it's purest form. I very much enjoyed the start of the show with Dave finding that perfect sound on his guitar and foot pedals to lead into the show. The back-up singers did an awesome job and even improved the sound of the Pulse material. Dave's cover of Syd's songs were very pleasing also and is testament to Dave's ability to share the light with all of his past band members. I do miss Roger Waters voice on Comfortably Numb as this song was the epitomie of Pink Floyd with Dave and Roger taking turns on lyrics which was the perfect contrast that was Pink Floyds trademark. The video and audio quality is excellent. If you enjoy Floyd music then you will enjoy this like a breath of fresh spring air.
B000G759LW|5.0|This is a truly remarkable CD set. I grew up listening to Bessie Smith, Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, and the Motown singers (no, I'm not that old, I was just the guy dressed like a punk rocker, and liking the Sex Pistols, but actually loving classic Jazz, Blues, and R&B best after being introduced to them by a guy I became friendly with who was a music teacher). It is fairly remarkable to see this diminutive woman and pop phenom known for her slightly raunchy Hip-Hop songs show her true range. From the first time I heard Aguilera several years ago I thought: \\"This woman really has a set of pipes, I wonder if she'll ever begin to explore her full range.\\" Well she has, and the result is wonderful. I have a feeling it must have been infuriating for her to be in the shadow of that Spears chick, the fellow Mouseketeer, who was all package but really didn't have the voice or style to sing anything real in any idiom. Aguilera pays homage to her antecedents; the numbers stylized versions, some deliberately recorded to simulate the kind of \\"in the can\\" sound you encounter when you hear an old Tin Pan Alley classic. Still, these songs remain hers. I am quite astounded. I doubt this album will appeal to many people much over forty. I think even octogenarians would be rocking in their walkers, if they gave it a chance, but that probably won't happen. What I hope is that Aguilera's fan base in their teens and early twenties will be inspired to listen to songs like Dinah Washington's version of \\"Cry Me a River\\" or Billie Holiday's \\"Mean To Me\\" and know where Aguilera is really coming from. Aguilera is a student of the Masters who came before her (she lays this out so well in the Hip-Hop styled intro), yet she can also deliver the goods. It gives me real hope. Not everything in the music business is, in the end, prepackaged, and there are those out there still carrying the torch and passing it on. Kudos to Aguilera! She may be a tiny woman, but she has a giant voice, and a real spirit.
B000GY729M|3.0|Ok, the first couple times I spun this one in the car I missed most of the songs completely, but When you were young, Bling, For Reasons Unknown and Red My mind are pretty darn catchy and well written songs.  They are the highlights of this CD and they alone probably made this purchase worth it.  However, once you hit track seven, just flip back to track three because the rest of the CD is a flaming turd.  Uncle Johnny and Bones have some of the worst lyrics I've ever heard, they sound like bad poetry written by a 13 year old after getting dumped on by his parents or tossed to the curb my his sweetheart.  This River is Wild has no flow and comes across as totally corney and Mr. Flowers can't even hit the range he's gunning for.  Track 11, Why do I keep Counting is more like Why Do I Keep listening?  Seriously guys, if I wanted to hear a Queen like song, I'd put the right CD in.   <br /> <br />Bottom line, tracks three, four, five and six are just excellent, I wish I could say that for at least a couple more songs on this disc to rank it up there with Hot Fuss.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|I can't understand why Phil Collins hasn't been knighted. In my opinion, he is on par with Sir Elton John CBE but better. His first song in the collection, \\"Another Day In Paradise,\\" talks about homelessness. We don't hear much about that issue in music. His rendition of \\"True Colors\\" is better than Cyndi Lauper's with the Collins touch. I don't really care for \\"Easy Lover\\" which is easy listening. I like \\"You Can't Hurry Love.\\" He should have won an Oscar for \\"Two Hearts.\\" Phil's voice is outstanding tool and has a great range from pop rock to smooth ballads like \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down,\\" and \\"Against All Odds.\\"  I like \\"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven.\\" I never cared for \\"Separate Lives,\\" and \\"Both Sides Of The Story.\\"  I like \\"One More Night\\" because it's smooth and easy listening. I never understood \\"Sussudio.\\" I like \\"Dance Into The Light,\\" \\"A Groovy Kind Of Love,\\" \\"In The Air Tonight,\\" and \\"Take Me Home.\\" If you love Phil Collins, you will love this collection.

B000067FP8|5.0|Watching this hilarious sequel to the original hit film is like watching a live action Looney Tunes.  With its fast paced motion, the plethora of gremlins doing wild and crazy things, all the \\"in jokes\\" and reference to the original, this sequel is just as good if not a little better than its original.<br /><br />Other than the insufferably cute little Mowgie, the other gremlins are horrific little demons who stop at nothing to wreak havoc in a luxurious high rise perpetrated by a Donald Trump tycoon (Mr. Clamp).  The virginal heroes from the original are back and even the snow plow driver and his wife show up.  It's all mindless, reckless fun and very entertaining.  Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates are appropriately naive and mushy; John Glover is a hoot as the tycoon; Robert Picardo is fine as Glover's henchman, Robert Plosky looking like Grandpa Munster is funny and Dick Miller and Jackie Joseph (who appeared in the original 1961 LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS) are good as the snowplow driver and his wife.<br /><br />Even almost 20 years later, these guys are hilarious.

B000002HO3|4.0|Simply Red was truly a British band of the 1980s. They were introduced to me by Music Television or MTV as it was known to release first with the single \\"Holding Back The Years,\\" or was it \\"If you Don't Know Me By Now.\\" \\"Stars\\" is also a classic from their heyday. There are other songs that I am not too familiar with like \\"Money's Too Tight To Mention,\\" \\"The Right Thing,\\" \\"It's Only Love,\\" \\"A New Flame,\\" \\"You've Got It,\\" \\"Something Got Me Started,\\" \\"Thrill Me,\\" \\"Your Mirror,\\" \\"For Your Babies,\\" \\"So Beautiful,\\" \\"Angel,\\" and \\"Fairground.\\" Simply Red like most of the bands of the 1980s had their own sound and style. Love the red hair color on the singer and always wondered if it was natural.
B00000HXFL|4.0|This was the first studio album Chet Baker cut after a lengthy stay in Italy (5 years), made in January 1965. He returned to the States with a new style (and a new axe - flugelhorn), playing \\"harsher\\" (his words) than ever before. He was also tackling new material, very advanced and creative. This is evident throughout this CD as he works his way (effortlessly, by the way) through a couple of Hal Galper compositions that are pretty complicated and sophisticated. BABY BREEZE has a blues march feel to it, and Chet's solo is melodic and strong. THIS IS THE THING is taken up and it's HOT, especially Frank Strozier's alto solo. Another Galper tune is PAMELA'S PASSION, also taken up, which goes out of tempo on occasion and thus produces excellent tension. Richard Carpenter contributed two tunes, the best being COMIN' DOWN, which sounds very much like Coltrane's GIANT STEPS. Baker sings on a few tunes, which is okay but no great shakes; on one of them (BORN TO BE BLUE) the focus for the listener is definitely on Bobby Scott's incredibly bluesy piano accompaniment. This is a solid album for Baker, offering up an exciting change and a deeper involvement. Nice!
0792833201|4.0|Admittedly, there are some truly frightening scenes in this classic shocker from Steven Spielberg, who co-wrote and executive produced and acclaimed horror director Tobe Hooper.  Spielberg's influence is certainly evinced in the family-oriented theme, and the attempted wholesomeness of the ghastly goings on.  Hooper's flashy style helps in establishing the movie's overall creepiness.  But in viewing this film some 20 years after its initial release, it almost seems to be a parody of itself and its imitations.<br /><br />There are times when it seems Spielberg holds back, not wanting to be TOO scary; he in fact argued with the ratings board to get the PG rating over the proposed R.  (There was no PG13 at this time).  The special effects of the beast are pretty routine compared to today's.  The gibberish that also explains the beast is pretty contrived and even diminutive Zelda Rubinstein's presence as the psychic seems to be a caricature of all the mediums we've been exposed too since.  The cast tries gamely but some of their dialogue is just too trite (especially with Beatrice Straight's character).  Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams try gamely and one can't fault their interpretations.  Ironically, the two daughters in the film suffered tragic deaths:  Dominique Dunn, the older daughter, was murdered by her boyfriend the year POLTERGEIST was released and angelic little Heather O'Rourke succumbed to abdominal stenosis some 6 years later.  POLTERGEIST is certainly better than most of the horror fodder out there today, and it does have some scary moments.
B000007T1M|5.0|As in all musical taste, band sounds change with time along with the listener's preference. It just seems that the System is expressing how it feels, the deep end. Today's Hypnotize and Mezmerize doesn't get that sketchy feeling like this album does. Sometimes you just wanna listen to the core of a band, and this shows what the potential of emotion in System of a Down's sounds are. To make things brief, Steal This Album, and this album are my favorites because (not for the pathetic excuse have unique taste) it either <br />Sounds catchier <br />or <br />is deep, but within has the feeling of freedom. <br /> <br />Although it could pass metal without the overusage of f--ks and language, it is an amazing album. One shouldn't expect it to be mainstream music, and many claim it to be \\"noise\\", but what better sounds in the world are expressed with roars? A newcomer band starting out with this is great. <br /> <br />As in many SoaD songs an intro is brought in (Suite-Pee, Soil, Atwa, Mr. Jack, and a handful off of \\"Mezmerize\\", bringing a sometimes misleading climax. It turns out to be a twist and of course the outcome, outstandingly orginal, is pulled off. This is only one of SoaD's techniques that perks the listener. <br /> <br />1. Suite-Pee 9/10 <br />2.

Enya has the power to make you feel like you're in a higher place than you actually are. When you hear her sing, you feel like you're on top of a mountain overlooking the views. Her music does that to me. It makes think of aspiring to something higher than reality. Thank God, Enya's voice is like that of an angel on earth. I love all her compact discs but this one is alright but as long as it's Enya, I will buy it.

0141439688|5.0|Persuasion is one of my favorite books -- and probably my favorite Austen, though I go back and forth between this and Pride and Prejudice.  P&P is more sparkling and witty; Persuasion feels more mature.  Definitely a book to read over and over.  And the letter from Captain Wentworth to Anne(you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there!) is the best-written letter in fiction.  Read it!  You won't be disappointed.
0393314804|4.0|As other reviewers have noted, Trainspotting is more a collection of short stories than an actual novel. Beyond the gritty surface, Trainspotting is more idea-driven than story-driven, as what ties it all together is the theme of addiction and acceptance.<br /><br />On one level, heroin addiction is portrayed as a symptom of a moribund Scottish working-class, struggling to deal with a post-industrial, post-Thatcher UK. It's telling that the only thing for a healthy person to do in the book is to move to London or out of the country entirely.<br /><br />On another level, heroin addiction is portrayed as a symptom of existential angst. Mark Renton AKA Rent-Boy is a nihilist for whom heroin is simply the most ready-made, prepackaged form of self-negation that he has access to. He fancies himself a martyr for the cause of oblivion, but as he himself attests, this martyrdom is childish, romantic, and entirely ego-centric.<br /><br />I would argue that, in essence, Trainspotting is a coming-of-age story. It deals with a group of young adults who are addicted to self-pity in varying degrees, in this case in the form of heroin. Some of the characters are able to get beyond their own fear and needless self-loathing and become full-fledged human beings. Others are not so lucky; the book is littered with psychic debris. In a more just society, more people might make it, but not everybody. That's life, and nobody can make you choose to live it.

0064409422|5.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Book Review <br /> The Chronicles of Narnia is a seven book series about the magical land of Narnia. The Lion, he Witch and the Wardrobe is the second book in the series, written by C.S. Lewis. The majority of the story takes place in the magical land of Narnia. The story begins when four siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were sent to a professor's house to stay safe during the war. Lucy, the youngest sibling found a wardrobe in the professors house that led to the land of Narnia. As she entered this land, she become acquainted with a friend, Tumnus, and as Edmund approached the land of Narnia, he was acquainted with what he thought was a friend, the Queen, but better known in Narnia as the White Witch. She was trying to take over the King, the Lord of Narnia, known as Aslan. The children realize what is happening with the Witch and Aslan, and defend the King of Narnia. The Witch is conquered and the children decide to stay in the land of Narnia. Many years pass and the children reappear to where they first entered Narnia, and go back through the wardrobe, and realize no time has passed since they left. The story about this land of Narnia continues on in the third book, The Horse and His Boy with reappearances from Edmund, Lucy and Susan. <br /> I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Your attention is caught in the first paragraph, and it is hard for your eyes to drift from the story until you reach the end. There is action, redemption, evil, love, courage, and so much more throughout the course of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe that every reader is able to enjoy this read. C.S. Lewis does a magnificent job of developing the characters. By the end of the story, you really do care about the well being of the main characters, and have a love and relationship with them. I would suggest every reader to try reading The Chronicles of Narnia, and especially the famous The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It is an easy read that kids, grownups, males and females should all enjoy. It has an amazing plot with wonderful characters, and is very enjoyable and fun to read.  <br />  <br />
B00000K3CR|5.0|This is just such a universally great movie.  I think so many people will love it.  One reviewer said it would be a good date movie.  I think that is correct.  It is funny and light.  Just a good movie.  I did see it on a date in fact.  I had to have my family see it and they loved it too.  I am not sure of the rating on this one, but I think this is pretty family friendly for most people.  I do not thing there is anything super sensitive to people.  Kids can see this and it would be just fine.  It really is for kids of all ages.  I do not want to give it away, but it involves toys and fortune.  The details are all done so well.  It is really great.  I really do not all older movies, some get too dated, but this one will stand the test of time.
B000FBGBPC|3.0|Ok, i bought this album because i liked the first one's sound.  In that respect, one x did not disappoint in the least.  They have creative, catchy riffs.  The drums are simple but they work.  The lead singer's voice does sound better in this effort than the first cd.  I am pleased overall by the sound. <br /> <br />Now, the lyrics are absolutely horrendous.  I am no songwriter, but I could've written these lyrics in a day if I put my mind to it.  Musicians are supposed to be modern day poets.  Granted, I certainly enjoy a large amount of music that is not very deep.  However, you can't name a song \\"time of dying\\" and expect anyone who knows who led zeppelin is to enjoy it.  The words are very simple.  There are no images of anything. There is no complex language or any creative lyrical techniques.  I end on the fact that one of their songs has the following chorus: <br />Let's start a riot, a riot <br />Let's start a riot <br />Let's start a riot, a riot <br />Let's start a riot <br /> <br />Are you kidding me?  If I'm going to pay money for this cd, which i did, I wish they would put a little more effort in.  Musically: an excellent listen. Lyrically: a musical travesty
B00061QK02|5.0|This movie is a commedy and it really delivers.  He is such a dork that it is so funny.  I normally do not laugh uncontroably like that at movies in public, but I was laughing so much I literally was in pain.  this movie is great.  It is really silly and stupid, but this comedy is outstanding.  a++++ this is real comedy.
1401302378|2.0|A clear example of having an idea and trying to stake a claim to it by sheer repetition without in any way developing that idea.   The author supposedly has a science degree but you would never know it.  There is no comparative analysis of different markets -- do music and movies and ebay items have exactly the same long tail distributions?  Is there anything to be learned from studying the differences as well as the superficial similarities between these different markets?  Look elsewhere for answers.  It was truly a test of patience to get to the end of this, and at the end my hopes for some new insight not in the Economist review were in vain.
B000031WD9|5.0|There are good movies and then there are movies like these that are just worth the price for the laugh factor.  Yeah it does have a plot a pretty stupid one, but it is so funny.  The second one is really funny too.  are you trying not to watch things with sex in them or not your kids well do not watch this.  this is full of sex references and inuendo.  It is really funny and worth the laugh if you are like me and just are not offended.

B0001ADAVK|5.0|My mom went to an ivy legue college during that time.  It helped me understand how different her life was than mine.  The way smoking was promoted then as a good thing to college girls.  The roles of women in school.  The less seriousness with which education was taken with women.  The decreased opportunity and the social norms of the time.  This really let me know about the time period and I saw so many things my mother had mentioned.  I disgussed it with her afterward.  She did not see it.  It helped me.  It was well acted and interesting.  Good character development.  A definate chick flick. They guys would hate this one most likely.  I really liked it.
B00009UW0N|5.0|When I was about 10 years old, I saw this movie for the first time at a friend's house when there was a sleepover. It was the scariest thing I have ever seen. Even since then, it has been my favorite horror movie or dare I say my favorite movie of all time? I think so. It's a classic. When I bought it on DVD i expected a bare bones edition with nothing besides the movie. I was wrong. I was shocked when I saw a documentary including interviews with John Carpenter, Debra Hill, Jamie Lee Curtis and P.J. Soles, among many others. I was pleasantly surprised at the director's commentary as well. I usually don't watch films with the commentary on because I find it ruins the film, but...I'm so fascinated with this film I had to see with. I highly recommened this film for anyone, horror fan or not.
B00001MXXH|5.0|Comming of age in the 80's is getting made fun of lately, but I thought it was a good time to grow up with the exception of the advent of AIDS. People were dieing so fast and I lost teachers to that.  It was not like today. This movie is really good and in the 1980's style.  It is a great comedy.  If you like the 80's and want to understand some of the refrences in the media where they keep saying Bueller repeated times see this movie.  You will also get to see where the guy who does the clear eyes comercials go his start in this movie.  Anyway perhaps you just might like the 80's if you do not already if you watch some of these good comming of age movies and listen to our music.
B000FP2ZCQ|5.0|I'm not the biggest black metal fan you'll ever meet. I enjoy my share of bands, but there was one band that is an essential for either the black metal fan or the melodic death metal fan. That's right, they were Dissection.<br /><br />I am glad that an essential album like this is rereleased and is receive better distribution. The album is just amazing beyond belief. The late Jon Nodtveidt was one of the greatest guitarists out in the black metal scene. Ole Ohman is a double bass machine! And with the dark feel of a black metal album embedded in their melodic talents, no wonder this album is such a legendary work of art.<br /><br />But wait! There's more! This reissue comes with a bonus disc as well! The first two tracks are a live recording recorded in 1995 but not released until a decade later. Next, we have the band's \\"Into Infinite Obscurity\\" 7\\" covering tracks 3 to 5. Tracks 6 to 9 are the 1992 demo, and track 10  is \\"The Grief Prophecy Demo\\" recorded in 1990. Tracks 3 to 10 are remastered. The final 3 tracks are closing rehearsal tracks from 1990-1991, all remastered as well. And no, they're NOT re-recorded. There's a difference between that and remastering.<br /><br />If you're new to this band, or just love Dissection, pick this up. It's inexpensive and you get a lot out of this reissue. Also, check out the \\"Storm of the Light's Bane\\" reissue as well.
B00005JKOI|5.0|This is a clasic movie for many of us who were at that age in that time period.  If you are not turned off by the 80's too much you will love this funny movie.  It is trendy for then, but it is really funny and good.  Just realize at the time these movies were some of our favorites.  It is still near and dear to my heart.  I think it is a classic.  If you like it go on to Ferris Bulers day off and Somekind of wonderful for other movies in this style and time period.
B00005JPAM|4.0|I sympathize with the Royal Family.  They don't choose to be Royals.  They have very little choice what they do with their lives, really.  They can't vote, they can't run for office, and they can't be anonymous.  The worst part is that nobody else seems to have any sympathy for them because they have so much money.  As we all know, money buys happiness. <br /> <br />This is a docudrama, mostly about the week after Princess Diana's death.  Diana and several other characters in the movie \\"appear as themselves,\\" as it were, through news footage.  For that reason, we never see the two princes, even though much of the movie concerns them, and they are at Balmoral when the action takes place.  Their absence is a bit too conspicuous.   <br /> <br />The drama comes from Tony Blair's desperate attempts to get the Queen to make more of a fuss over Diana's death.  To him, it is a no-brainer: the public is terribly upset and want their Queen to help them with their grief.  To Elizabeth II, it is all hype.  Why should the flag fly at half-mast at Buckingham Palace, when that isn't even done for people who still are part of the Royal Family?  The Queen must come to terms with the cult of celebrity. <br /> <br />The Queen and Tony Blair (ironically) are the most sympathetic characters in the movie.  Charles and Philip are played as buffoons, which I did not particularly care for.  These are complex people and, truth be told, we will never really know what life is like for that family, no matter how much we'd like to believe otherwise.   <br />
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|I saw this movie when I was working at a mental hospital.  I helped me to understand what schizophrenia might be like to some people.  If you want to know about that watch this and do not learn to much about the movie it will reck it.  Just know that this is very well done and respectfully done.  It is based on a true story, but not a documentary.  The acting is excellent.  If you want to understand more watch this.  It is a beautiful movie.
0684803356|5.0|We'll start with the simple ones: sad, deep, bloody...<br /><br />But it's the longer ones that truly sum up the book: thoughtful, emotional, frightening...<br /><br />\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" starts out simply enough, but it slowly progresses to being a book that houses a series of complex, not entirely predictable characters. Robert Jordan is the main character, an American, often comparing, often thinking. We follow him around in the midst of a not-so-pleasant, frighteningly bloody war. He is accompanied by other men who are either helping him, or have similar tasks, though not all are so. There is Pablo, who in reality, is Jordan's enemy, in that he intends to prevent Jordan from blowing up a certain bridge. There is Pablo's wife, Pilar, who tells a chunk of the book in the form of stories to Jordan about the past. There is Maria, Jordan's crush, and though many concentrate on their love, Maria is a rather flat character, though her history is one that tells more about the surrounding situation.<br /><br />The book itself isn't across that long of a time span, on the other hand it includes many stories that are told to Jordan. The reader is drawn in quickly, and despite the blood, the fear, and the uneasy way everything is written, it's an incredible book. Perhaps it's because of these things; they make the book more realistic and touching to the reader.<br /><br />It is certainly a great book, a wonderful read, and an interesting view on a little known event. It's a good book to read, even if you're not fond of stories with death and blood.
078322687X|5.0|This movie is all about character development of people who are all drastically different.  This is a comming of age film for the 1980's.  The acting is wonderful.  It is a different style of movie.  There were some really great movies comming out then.  Ferris Beulers Day off, Pretty in Pink and some kind of wonderful.  This is another one.  It is a classic of the time period for the people comming of age durning this time.  The 1980's is a time I was fond of.  I do not find it tacky as the media is right now.  This movie is funny.  Some of these classics get refered to in  other movies.  You might want to watch it.
1594481938|4.0|The amazing thing about Nick Hornby is his wry, dry, warped sense of humour (and I do mean that in a good sense) that can turn even mundane and/or taboo subjects into irresistible comedy. <br /> <br />This time, it's suicide. Well, OK, failed suicide and life following it, for four strangers who meet at the top of a tower block on New Year's Eve, all intending to jump. In stopping each other, they create an alliance / friendship of sorts, and in telling their stories, Nick Hornby creates another great novel. Well worth reading  <br />
0316776963|5.0|I reread this recently and I laughed as much as I did the first time I read it.  David Sedaris is quite a national treasure even though most people don't know who he is!  His writing is wonderful, poignant, sentimental and hilarious.  The man knows how to write well and you can tell he continues to love his craft. <br /> <br />I don't think I have read a book that made me laugh as much as this one did.  I think I had to put this book down at least a hundred times and walk away from it because I was laughing too hard.  You know, the kind of laughing that causes mild asphyxiation.   <br /> <br />This book is delirious with humor and great story telling.  A must read for anyone who wants to have a wonderful reading experience.  I don't see how you could miss with Me Talk Pretty One Day.

B000127LW2|4.0|For whatever reasons, \\"Voyager\\" even now takes a lot of heat for being sub-par \\"Trek\\".  But, I don't know, I always thought it was a pretty good show, though I often skipped it when it was on the air due to my hatred of frequent commercials.  Even this first season, when (like most \\"Trek\\" shows) it was still finding its footing, \\"Voyager\\" was pretty entertaining.  Heck, right out of the box, Jerry Goldsmith's theme alone was gold.<br /><br />And, like all TV on DVD, don't underestimate the \\"commercial-less\\" effect: while a truly bad episode of something will always be a truly bad episode, episodes of \\"Voyager\\" I remember as being mediocre when they were first broadcast now flow better and entertain better now that all the dumb commercials have been removed.  So, episodes I rated in the past as two-star quality now feel like three-star episodes; episodes I remember as rating three-stars before now often feel like three-and-a-half or even four star shows, etc.  It's amazing.<br /><br />But I do agree with the other reviewers that this series' various season-length sets still cost too much.  The high cost especially stands out with this first season, which is quite short.  C'mon, Paramount... don't you want to sell some boxed sets?  Drop those prices!
B0002KRTUW|2.0|If you want to read a synopsis of the movie, you can look elsewhere such as \\"Spotlight Reviews.\\" This is just my opinion.     I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone. Due to a high content of bad words (being used left and right by children, women, etc), screaming and violence, it's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else. My ears got tired half-way through the movie. The violence committed by kids is just not realistic. Some people may say that kids can grow up violent if treated badly or molested, but I think the way it's presented in this movie is over-the-edge.     Some people really enjoyed it, and that's not me, and that's not the other two people I know who watched it. This movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense, with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies.     There's one good idea in this movie and that's how life develops as it goes along, and one action or inaction changes how life plays out. But this is no where near original, even the Simpsons had an episode like that. And this movie just goes scene after scene of how the main character jumps back in time to try to change the future. It got boring after a while, and I was thinking: \\"So, here goes for another trip into the past.\\"     So, this movie is definitely not on my best movies list.
1400031354|4.0|Mma Precious Ramotswe's No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is going strong and has new cases to solve. In the most challenging one, an American woman whose son went missing ten years before hires Mma Ramotswe to find out what happened to him.<br /><br />There are changes in store for the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency as Mma Ramotswe's secretary is promoted to assistant detective and given her own case.<br /><br />Changes at the agency aren't the only ones. At the end of the first book in this marvelous series, Mma Ramotswe agreed to marry Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, proprietor of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. Their courtship continues in this second book, and even more significant changes are in store for the happy couple as a result of Rra Matekoni's good deeds at a nearby orphanage.<br /><br />Of course, not everyone is happy that Rra Matekoni plans to marry Mma Ramotswe, and that unhappy person has sinister plans.<br /><br />Another fun book by Alexander McCall Smith, whose writing evokes the cadence of African rhythms and the simple goodness of the Batswana.
0618680004|5.0|Unlike his previous book, the magnificent \\"The Ancestor's tale\\", this one isn't a scholarly work. It is written in a conversational tone, and is basically an argument against blind faith and in favor of fact-based reason. Of course, when the writer is of such caliber, no \\"argument\\" is going to be a simple declaration of belief in this and disbelief in that based on a few bits of filmsy evidence. \\"The God Delusion\\" is a veritable broadside of facts, data and analyses, scientific, historical and philosophical, that back Dawkins' point of view.   <br /> <br />The most refreshing aspect of Dawkins' writings on religion is that unlike many of today's agnostics or atheists, he doesn't pay lip service to the respect that is apparently due to the irrartional beliefs of others. That may be deemed a grating trait to many, but it is certainly a honest attitude. Plus, because we have here the example of someone who isn't afraid to call a cat a cat, this books comes across as a breath of fresh air after all the nonsense we've had to endure in the past few years from Intelligent Design advocates and their attempt to bring science education back three hundred years in the name of superstition. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B000HDR9NG|5.0|If The Killers' 2004 \\"Hot Fuss\\" album represented the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas - one-night stands, go-go dancers, gratuitous gambling and relationship problems between young adults; then 2006's \\"Sam's Town\\" is the gritty local casino down the road - with its motley crew of locals. If you're a patron of the \\"Hot Fuss\\" casino then you're not going to like travelling the route to \\"Sam's Town\\". However, if you are not necessarily looking for Hot Fuss Part 2, but something still unmistakenly The Killers, this album you will love.  <br /> <br />We start the journey with the title track all ablaze with Brendan Flowers' walls of synth, thumping drums from Ronnie Vannucci, but also a chunky guitar part from Dave Keuning - something that musically sets the scene for the whole album. Here, Flowers greats the listener with the words 'Nobody ever had a dream 'round here...' (but he does of course) then questions 'Why do you waste my time?' in a big chorus, and then 'Have you ever seen the light?'. Flowers is answering his critics while showing them people can rise above their station (he was a former bellhop at the Gold Coast Hotel). The title track ushers in the new more mature Killers; the \\"Sam's Town\\" adult versus the \\"Hot Fuss\\" adolescent.  <br /> <br />The video clip of the first single \\"When You Were Young\\" when placed in the album's context is much more meaningful. It depicts the plight of a naive young woman (in Sam's Town) who fell for the wrong guy. The single is musically an accurate gauge for the rest of the album; prominent guitars with big synth chorus.  <br /> <br />The strangely titled track four is my favourite on the album. 'Bling (Confessions of a King)' is an amazingly constructed song, chugging along at a gallop with a wonderful melody and lyrics. I envision riding my horse in a rush to reach my destination with the wind blowing in my face in order to save my loved one thinking ... 'When I offer you survival, you say its hard enough to live...How do you know that you're right if you're not nervous anymore? It's not so bad, it's not so bad'. And when I think the song can't get any better, it has the most wonderfully uplifting ending with Flowers rising to 'higher and higher - we're gonna take it ... out of the fire, we're gonna make it'. \\"Sam's Town\\" is worth it just for this song.  <br /> <br />The rest of the album doesn't relent either, especially the second single \\"Bones\\". We get a picture of potential lovers frolicking on a nearby river bank to the tune of 'don't you want to feel my bones on your bones?'. With its horns and Flowers' high pitched whine, this track sounds like a Robert Smith (The Cure) pop song circa mid 90's. It just showcases \\"The Killers\\" versatility. It follows the daunting \\"Uncle Johnny\\" with Mark Stoemer's great sliding bass lines (the best I've heard since Tool's song Lateralus). Uncle Johnny has wasted away his life in Sam's Town. This song is another reminder why The Killers are going to sell out stadiums around the world: when I wonder how the song will end a massive chorus of backing vocals hit like an anthem. This album is full of anthems: track 9 \\"My List\\", track 10 \\"This River is Wild\\", and track 11 \\"Why do I Keep Counting?\\" are huge conclusions to Sam's Town and will entertain crowds everywhere.  <br /> <br />The inclusion of the average \\"Where the White Boys Dance\\" detracts from overall product. I don't listen to this song as it is not in the context of the album. Others like it however. <br /> <br />The greatest acts in the history of rock have evolved to shape music and The Killers have manifest into something special. It may not occur, but this album should be the one which catapults this band to be alongside the biggest band in the world - U2, if not superscede them. I didn't actually think The Killers were this good. Brendan Flowers himself said people will be remembering this album in 20 years time, I agree - it is that good.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|When 30stm released their debut album I immediately fell in love with it. Call me a dork but I loved all the crazy lyrics about the life on Mars and being on Jupiter.  <br /> <br />For three torturous years I heard nothing from the band except that they were lost somewhere in Guam rewriting the album.  <br /> <br />When the band debuted Attack I was ecstatic. It was a killer song, polished to perfection that had much of their old sound to it. But after I obtained an advance copy of the album I must say I was a little disappointed. Much of the album was a bit like 30stm on power ballads and nothing from their adventures in the solar system that I had come to love with the first album.  <br /> <br />That being said the album quickly grew on me and I found myself listening more and more to a beautiful lie. While some of the lyrics don't always make the most sense e.g. \\"On his face is a map of the world.\\" Songs like The Kill and Was it a Dream? are beautifully prosed and musically tight.  <br /> <br />While a Beautiful Lie is a slight change of style from their original album ultimately I think of it as a positive growth in direction for the band. As they didn't drastically overall their sound and style to be more radio friendly. You gotta respect them for that.  <br /> <br />Ultimately if you liked their debut album I would recommend purchasing this one. You won't be disappointed. <br />

6300268985|5.0|I rented this film in my youth, and after I had watched it, left it downstairs next to the VCR.  My younger sister popped it in, and I heard a mouthful from my older brother about how she shouldn't have been watching it, and I shouldn't have been watching it.  Well, it's too late, I already did watch it, and my mind is now officially warped, hehehehe...My brother would freak out at other early favorites of mine, like Joe's Garage and Trout Mask Replica, but he was OK.  As for this film, I love Ken Russell's work.  He was on fire in the 1970's, and it's a shame that he hasn't really made a great film since Altered States.  This film really has nothing to do with Franz Liszt (or Richard Wagner), but it's still a marvel to look at and to listen to.  Great stuff.  Now, how about a DVD?
B000HIVO64|5.0|I admit that my first impression of THE INFORMATION was that Beck had phoned this one in, kinda like a \\"Beck-By-Numbers\\" pastiche. But it only took a few more listens for his fantastic songwriting ability to shine through for me. Beck already merged just about every conceivable music genre on MELLOW GOLD and ODELAY, so it's not really fair to expect him to reinvent the freakin' wheel with every new album.<br /><br />In that respect, THE INFORMATION has less mind-blowing variety than many of his previous efforts, but it's loaded with plenty of great rhythms and beats as can be expected from Beck. There's lots of super-catchy hooks and many of the songs are as good as any he's ever written. Also typical of Beck, there's a lot of sounds and \\"sub-melodies\\" guaranteed to keep the listener intrigued for many a listen. Beck raps all over this album. He's kind of in a rap world of his own - he plays by his own rules. On THE INFORMATION, he moves beyond the white boy self parody bit to rap about anything he wants.<br /><br />Of particular note is the trippy extended final track that morphs repeatedly and reaches a spacey, almost epic peak at the chorus. But it does peter out towards the end, digressing into some spoken word nonsense that can get boring on repeated listens (as spoken word typically does when added to music). That's OK - as I often do, I've made my own copy of this album and I just shaved off the end of that song in a particular place that appealed to me. Considering the interactive direction Beck seems to be headed in, I suspect he would approve.<br /><br />The extra DVD contains the entire album with amusing video shennanigans from Beck and assorted friends. It's fun to have on at a party!<br /><br />As ever, Beck is still an extremely creative musician. THE INFORMATION is further proof and a most worthy addition to any music collection.
B00008NRI7|4.0|\\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is a romantic comedy about Lucy, an idealistic and gutsy Harvard law school graduate (played by Sandra Bullock), who is hired into a prestigious law firm by the firm's jet-setting partner, George (portrayed by Hugh Grant).  George's brother owns the firm. <br /> <br />George enjoys considerable wealth and perks afforded by his position.  He is handsome and rather charming, and he is divorced after philandering.   Lucy and George are direct opposites.  Lucy is from a working, middle class family.  Her mother is a law professor and her father is an attorney with a social conscience.  George seems to have inherited his privileged lot in life.   <br /> <br />Like her father, Lucy is compassionate towards the underdog.  Her latest crusade is an attempt to save a community center located in an aging building.  George's brother wants to demolish this building and replace it with a profitable high-rise. He expects George to close the deal on this project even though George is conflicted because of his increasing  respect and admiration for Lucy.   <br /> <br />When Lucy leaves the law firm in favor of pro bono work, her replacement is a pretty, ambitious, and calculating young Harvard graduate who immediately sets her sights on George.  Complications arise because Lucy has feelings for George and vice versa. <br /> <br />\\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is a competent comedy.  However, to thoroughly appreciate its story, one has to be sympathetic to the lead characters.  Lucy is a person of integrity and conviction.  George only begins to develop these qualities because of his association with Lucy.  For most of the movie, George is a shallow, materialistic womanizer.  It is doubtful that these two would actually end up together. <br /> <br />Still \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is a fairly pleasant diversion especially if you are fans of Bullock or Grant.  These two talented actors give the movie more appeal than perhaps it deserves.  <br /> <br />

0743298020|4.0|Diane Setterfield has definitely left the gate running with her debut novel 'THE THIRTEENTH TALE'. Not only is the story of mysterious author Vida Winter haunting it is also very well written, a hard combination to come by for a first time novelist.<br /><br />Setterfield tells the story of Margaret an armature biographer who is commissioned to write the biography of Vida Winter a living legend amongst novelists.  Ms winter is not only one of best writers of present day she is also notorious for keeping her past under wraps.  She has made up varying accounts of her history in every interview she has ever conducted and now in her last days she is ready to tell all, with only two conditions...first, the story must be told in order beginning, middle and end and second, no questions may be asked.  Margaret, not sure she is up to the task of writing what will inevitably be a very important piece of work is quickly drawn in to Ms. Winters story when a startling discovery leads her to believe that she and the famous author may have more in common than meets the eye.<br /><br />Vida Winter's story is captivating from the very beginning and will definitely draw the reader in and keep you guessing until the very unpredictable ending.  My only regret about 'THE THIREENTH TALE' was that Margaret's own story was no where near as intriguing and I kept wanting to get back to learning the secrets of Vida Winter.  With that said, Setterfield's novel is definitely worthy of all of the praise it has garnered thus far and she is definitely an author to watch!
0553588486|4.0|Book one of Martin's a Song of Ice and Fire was the only book in this series Martin wrote with the fire, born of artisitic desire. For people familiar with this series, you'll know about Martin's approach to fantasy writing in these books. Going for the shock factor in his stories and painting the morality of his characters whether hero or villain, with a shade of grey.<br /><br />For the new readers and old alike, this book is trully great and I would recommend it to any fantasy fan. However, it would be wise to note that even though a Game of Thrones is a great book, the progressive novels in the series aren't. They range from good to above average, to average if not awful.<br /><br />Their criticisms - for me - stem from an overall lowering of the mystique and appeal of whatever the author seems to envision in the first book, and then a decidedly cheap approach towards unpredictability in his story's plot, by killing and degrading relatively key and interesting characters. He does the killing-off in such a careless manner that the deaths of the said characters, serve no purpose in the narrative, in fact they only leave the remainder of whatever plot there is very bare, with no resolution in sight.<br /><br />Characters formerly potrayed as villains are given more humane motivations without really being compelling and Martin falls into the trap of doing this for almost all of them. Almost as if the characters he killed off were only to make room for said characters, but the overall plot suffers greatly as a result.<br /><br />My comments end here, but for anyone newly introduced to this series just read book one, because the seed of what looked like a fantasy gem, doesn't grow beyond this book. Plus it's better not to have your expectations dashed.

B000BP86OG|4.0|After their debut The Darkness were either going to grow or implode. Luckily they chose the former. This album has had so much attention to detail lavished on it, so much work has been done to ensure every moment was the appropriate Darkness experience.<br /><br />The quirks come in droves, filling this album with lovely touches. And the whole package, from the cover art to the employment of Roy Thomas Baker as producer shows the same effort. With stronger songs the fact that Justin insists on using his high register gimmick voice every darn song grates less but it's still an issue for this listener. But at least The Darkness got people talking again about this style of much maligned hard rock and got a whole new generation into a certain style of music. And annoyed a certain John Bon Jovi (who clearly doesn't get it). Then again his criticism is coming from a guy who built his career on selling power ballads to 15 year old girls. So lighten up John!<br /><br />The good time rock here is a breath of fresh air, just constant pleasant feelings wash over the listener. The way the band have taken some risks here is also worthy of a mention. Musically it is restrained when it needs to be and full blooded hard rock when appropriate. While the live show for this album made it clear that this is the Justin Hawkins show on record that feel is lessened due to the absene of the visual element. Dan Hawkins knows his way around a riff and the more open songs highlight the contribution of the other players.<br /><br />Not quite five stars due to the overuse factor of Justins castrati novelty act vox and the slightly not quite right experiment that is English Country Garden. But overall a great album and as for the whole 'are they serious/are they taking the mickey' - well I couldn't care less. As long as the final result is this good they can have my money

Just turn up the bass a little and crank it loud. I like about 80% of the songs in this collection, and for the price you can't go wrong; Nice booklet w/ lots of cool pictures included. With this collection, you'd only need to buy a handful of other discs to complete your Motown collection...
B00009Z576|2.0|Drama was and remains a big disappointment. Quite beyond the inferior vocals of Trevor Horn is the appalling lack of good material. This album sticks out like a sore thumb in the Yes catalogue. Apart from \\" Tempus Fugit\\", The songs lack compositional quality and lyrical strength. I found \\"Machine Messiah\\" almost unlistenable. Save your money or buy Jon Anderson's \\"Song of Seven\\" instead.
