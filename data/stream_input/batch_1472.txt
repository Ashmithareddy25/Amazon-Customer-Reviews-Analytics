B001E45XT4|5.0|I've used Plantronics in the past for work and that's why I purchased these.  I have not been disappointed.  The headphones are big, but very comfortable.  The sound is good and the mic works well.  The price was fantastic!!
B005HEUKMW|5.0|Well, given that the first review of this episode has to deal with the DVD purchase and<br />not the episode, a second screed seems necessary. All I have to say about this episode<br />is that I'd bet good $ that Riker kept a Veron-T Disrupter in his boot...
B005LAIGPU|3.0|good movie you know the plot pretty much at the start. ending was ok could of been alot better with what the movie had going for it.
B000002NJS|5.0|I will always cherish the Ray of Light era. I became a fan around this<br />time and decided to go out and get this album. The songs bring out the<br />best of her on a vocal level. It doesn't sound so little girly or shaky.<br />Instead, it sounds more mature and in control. I definitely think that<br />this is vocally superior to the rest in her discography. After Like A<br />Prayer, it's her second most personal album that this time it deals with<br />spirituality and motherhood. She also dabbles into the hinduism and<br />Japanese geisha cultures. The album cover is also one of her best. She<br />looked so refreshing and youthful. She also looked her best in this era.<br />I love the long, honey blonde hair she was sporting. This album was<br />released around the same time Janet came out with the Velvet Rope and<br />Mariah with Butterfly. All three albums are very personal and have their<br />own symbols. Ray of Light has \\"}   {\\" symbol. Velvet Rope has the<br />Swahili heart symbol. And Butterfly...of course has the butterfly.<br />Someone who is a newcomer to Madonna, should definitely include this on<br />their list. It should have went #1 on the charts. The production flow so<br />well and it's her best visionary/concept album after Like A Prayer and<br />Erotica.<br /><br />1. Drowned World, Substitute For Love (5/5)-track opener where it shows<br />a much more wise, relaxed Madonna reflecting on her past...her hunger<br />for fame and attention.<br /><br />2. Swim (5/5)-very relaxing, laidback, peaceful track. I think about the<br />ocean floor.<br /><br />3. Ray of Light (4.5/5)-shows what the entire album is all<br />about...rebirth. I don't listen to this song so often. It feels kinda<br />overrated at the moment. She sang this song to death on all her tours<br />after the Ray of Light era.<br /><br />4. Candy Perfume Girl (5/5)- I love this song! She totally owned it! It<br />gives me Alanis Morisette vibes. One of the best on here! OMG...the<br />lyrics and sound slay me!<br /><br />5. Skin (5/5)-Another amazing song that I honestly don't know what to<br />say about it.<br /><br />6. Nothing Really Matters-I love the video. It encaptures the life of a<br />geisha. The song is one of the amazing highlights of this album. I had<br />no idea that it sampled Chaka Khan's I'm Every Woman. Now that I think<br />about it...I could hear it. I love this part where she says \\"Nothing<br />takes the past away like the future....nothing makes the darkness go<br />like the light...you're shelter from this storm...gives me in comfort in<br />your arms.\\".<br /><br />7.Sky Fits Heaven (5/5)-When you listen to this song, you think about<br />how Madonna has come along way from her like a virgin days. She is truly<br />the queen of reinvention. that is one of the reasons why i became a fan.<br />she has such an amazing career that you could look back on and say<br />\\"wow\\".<br /><br />8. Shanti/Ashtangi (5/5)-Another thing to praise Madonna for...she's<br />very experimental and open minded. She explores the hindu culture. I<br />remember seeing pictures of her posing as an hindu and I thought she<br />looked gorgeous. Those are definitely my favorites.<br /><br />9. Frozen (5/5)-the Frozen video is the best one she ever did since<br />Bedtime story. it's so dark, gothic, and edgy like the lyrics and<br />violins. It's about a lover not confronting your feelings and not<br />showing endearment.<br /><br />10. The Power of Goodbye (5/5)-It's pretty similar to Frozen with its<br />lyrical tone and atmosphere along with the video. Next to Frozen, it's<br />her most relatable song on here. I love this line \\"You were my lesson I<br />had to learn\\".<br /><br />11. To Have And Not To Hold (5/5)-Amazing lyrics...that's all I have to<br />say.<br /><br />12. Little Star (5/5)-This song feels so precious and special. It's of<br />course dedicated to her daughter, Lola. This will bring tears into your<br />eyes. You could sense that ever since she became a mother, she feels<br />complete and content that she was never able to feel before.<br /><br />13. Mer Girl (5/5)-It feels so lifeless and sad. She talks about her<br />mother's death in this one but it sounds kinda graphic and dark. The way<br />I interpret this song is Madonna is feeling lost and empty that she<br />turns to her mother's grave for comfort.nce she became a mother, she feels<br />complete and content that she was never able to feel before.<br /><br />13.

B007EC27QM|5.0|works easy to use numbers are big good for those who cant find their glasses. opens up with no problem
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Its pretty addicting even being so repetitive. If you enjoy fast little levels and buffing yourself up the way you want then try this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app and it is a lot of fun to play when you are on trips and stuff.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This product is exactly what I was looking for. It has multiple compartments to hold accessories for my DSLR camera. It is convenient and practical at the same time. It protects my camera, and puts the camera in an easily accessible place for quick access. Great product, very happy with my purchase. Comparible to name brand products at a fraction of the cost.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|i was glad when this came out for kindle fire. it works perfectly for me and i have never had any problems. fun times. easy to draw on the big screen , better  than iPhone.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a very cute addictive game. You don't have to wait days for things to happen.  You have the option to purchase coins but I never had to.  Part of the challenge is building up your coins to make a purchase. I go on here as often as I can because it is just plain fun. And the best part is it truly is FREE.
0545425115|5.0|The hunger games is an amazing series!. Each book gets better and better. Only one more to go then :-). Highly recommend this book
B0034G4OY0|4.0|This movie came through the mails very quickly. It was in perfect shape. It is an interesting movie and very much worth watching.
0312330537|5.0|I can't believe so many people have such a visceral reaction to this book. It is an amazing read, and a hazard to your work/social/academic life. If you looking for phrases to ridicule and obsessing about technical details, you are missing out on an great story. I know many people don't like the \\"politics\\" or what is being presented- hero of book is an ex-con escaping prison, heavy drug use, involved in organized crime, gunrunner for mujaheddin against Soviets, etc... If that bothers you enough to prevent the enjoyment of an excellent book, this may not be for you.  I was sad when I finished this book years ago, and immediately tried to find another epic book at the same level, and have not found it yet.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For my every day carry pocket knife, this sharpener works well. I use every couple of months to keep the blade on my Gerber pocket knife nice and sharp, and it always gets it right back to where I want it. I use the Gerber all the time so it tends to dull faster than an occasional use knife. The fold out piece for serrations works great to keep the lower serration knife and sharp, and it's easy to use.<br /><br />If you use any kind of smaller knife on a daily basis or just want a decent sharpener for general use, this is a great one to get.
B007P6VM04|1.0|Nothing new to add--I just want to get my two cents in. I wish I had looked more carefully before buying this ridiculous CD. There are only two really good cuts--\\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" and \\"History is Made at Night.\\" I really wanted the songs from \\"Bombshell,\\" but instead they included about everything else, including the hymn from the last episode. Now I have to go to itunes to get the songs I really wanted. There were a lot of great show tunes during the course of the series, but the producers of this CD are obviously targeting the teeny-bopper crowd (who would be just as happy with the \\"Glee\\" soundtrack) instead of those of us who appreciate good Broadway writing. If you check out IMDB's message board under \\"disappointing CD\\" you will find almost universal condemnation of this CD.

B007BVOF8E|2.0|If you can't sleep, take a pill, read Numbers in the Bible, or watch this movie.<br /> I think the acting is great, but it is the slowest movie ever.<br /><br />I am a big Gary Oldman fan, but even he couldn't save this sleep inducer.<br />S-L-O-W!  Did I make my point?

1469984202|5.0|I bought this on a whim on a weekend road trip along with the classic \\"Enders Game\\" series.  This was easily as engrossing and interesting.. I absorbed it continuously over the weekend to the dismay of my husband and son.  I literally could not put it down.  Great characters, great story.  you won't be disappointed.  Fingers crossed that Hugh's other books are as good as I am off to buy another.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|That's it in a nutshell. The large amount of fun courses making it very addicting. And hey, it's free, what could be better?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I picked up this book, I expected it to be full of BDSM and crude language. I was pleasantly surprised that it was not smutty erotica. The book is well written with elements of eroticism and lots of romance. The sign of a great book is to see characters develop and make change. Ana and Christian are not flat characters and both change as a result of knowing each other. Yes there is lots of sex (hey, that's what you're looking for when you read a romance novel) but there is also great plot development. I highly recommend this book for those with a little wild side and large romantic side!!!!
145210655X|4.0|Jeffrey Brown has written/drawn a wonderfully funny comic about fatherhood from the point of view of Darth Vader and a young Luke Skywalker. The book is a series of one page skits, drawn and coloured in the best artwork Brown has produced yet, and if you're a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, you'll love it.<br /><br />There's lot of cute moments like young Luke pointing to a toy Jar Jar and Vader saying \\"This isn't the toy you're looking for\\", or when young Luke is crying after being pushed by young Greedo: \\"Waaaah!\\" \\"What happened?\\" \\"Greedo pushed me!\\" \\"Well, did you push him first?\\". There are also some darker moments like young Luke asking Vader why it's called a Death Star, or when Luke gets a cut on his right arm and Vader's putting a band-aid on it...<br /><br />If you're a huge Star Wars fan and a father you'll get the most out of it, because of all the side references to the original movies. Kids might enjoy it too but probably won't get the more subtle jokes. \\"Darth Vader and Son\\" is a fine, fun comic book from Jeffrey Brown.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|A must read ! Couldn't put it down ! Awesome book ! excellent story line , twists and so well written , can't wait for S. j Watson to write another thriller, hopefully very soon ! =0)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I really like this game good thinking one just have trouble with the harder puzzles because the boxes are so small
1451627289|5.0|I lived through this day and loved this book. No rambling tangents as occur in some King books. It brought back many memories and stirred up long lost feelings of my childhood in the 50's and 60's. A much simpler time in so many ways and yet not perfect. Very creative and well written. I listened to it on audio and well done to the narrator.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this game but my Friend has the Update for his phone...I Don't like that I can't have The UPDATE RIGHT THIS MINUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ROAR!!!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After learning about the books and watching the movie I wanted to know more of this story. I bought this book and finished it in one day. I was hooked I couldn't put it down. It is an amazing story one that really makes your eyes open and humbles you to the sufferings of others.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is really fun fun when you get into it more. The game might be boring and slow at first but then it gets good. THIS IS A AWESOME GAME!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is great if you enjoy solitaire! The ads aren't bad,  once they appear you can immediately skip. This app is also very easy to use on the kindle fire!
B000H7J9RQ|1.0|Barbra is fantastic in this classic recording of the concert for 500 of her closest friends.  Unfortunately, the used disk contains a defect which disables it from playing in a Blu-Ray or standard DVD player.  In both cases it yields a \\"will not play\\" code.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these games. I work late at night and they keep me laughing! I would recommend these to anyone
B004HUE57S|5.0|Unfortunately, I ordered the \\"regular\\" size, wireless version of this mouse first.  I found the mouse too large to hold comfortably in my hand and I wear a \\"large\\" size golf glove.  I also found that the wireless model would go to \\"sleep\\" very quickly and there would be a slight delay to it's responsiveness when you tried to use it again.  Since I was having pain in my shoulder blade that seemed to be related to mouse use, I was willing to fork out the purchase price again for this model.  This model is excellent.  Within a day or two, I've grown completely comfortable using this mouse.  It's very responsive and precise, unlike the larger wireless one.

B000H30B2C|2.0|King Kong is about a 90 minute movie squeezed into over 3 hours.  Talk about taking a relatively simple straightforward plot and extending it beyond all reasonable comprehension.  That's what you get with this.  Everything about this movie is just overly drawn out.  It takes forever just to get started. An overly long wait just to get the main characters to get to the ship.  An overly long trip to Skull Island.  An overly long time just to park the ship for crying out loud.  There are times where Jack Black is just staring at things for an inordinate amount of time.  In one scene, on the island, he's staring at the film in the camera and pondering something.  Even a simple scene like that takes too long. Get the idea?  You don't even get to see King Kong until about 90 minutes into this monstrosity.  Even basic events like the dinosaur stampede are just mind numbing and overplayed. I could have gotten up, gone to the bathroom, gone to the kitchen, picked up some snacks, gone back to the TV and the dinosaurs would have still been crashing into each other.  It's just ridiculous.  I get that Jackson was trying to turn it into an epic, but it just doesn't work.  This isn't Lord of the Rings.  King Kong does not have a following like that.  Making a movie extra long doesn't automatically make it good.  Another problem with the movie is the main characters.  Naomi Watts is fine, but she has zero chemistry with Adrian Brody.  None.  The love story falls flat on it's face.  How can it work anyway when Watt's character obviously favors the giant ape?  Brody's character becomes almost pointless.  This movie was just so long and boring that I almost never finished it.  I finally ended up watching the end almost 3 weeks later.  I cared that little about it. The DVD quality is fine.  You get extended scenes, in case the original wasn't long enough for you.  More scenes of the endless supply of ship crewmen getting massacred by dinosaurs.  There must have been 200+ crewmen on that little ship.  There are tons of extras on the DVD's for those that want to spend a week processing King Kong.
0618871713|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  I was blown away by the drawings and text.  It is a work of compression (each moment a cartoon panel) and deep compassion.  Bechdel's work is intellectually powerful.  This book is truly excellent.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I think this is a boring app . I kind of think It shouldn't be #1, but that does .......... not matter . :-

B002MQYOFW|1.0|I believe this book was intended for much younger readers.  I do not like the violence and the story line.  I wonder what this generation is coming to.  considering my age I would not recomment this for most readers.  just don't \\"get it\\". I would not purchase the other two books in this series.  I talked to my grandson so I know the ending BUT.......just not to my liking!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love these books. They are short, easy to read, but full of twists and turns. The story flows well from book to book and I am excited about the final chapter.  I needed a fix after the Harry Potter series ended and I think I found it.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I simply cannot believe how good this book was to read.  Unbelievable that Howey isn't getting more press for this book.  With the turn (or click in my case) of every page, I was drawn further into the depths of the silo saga of WOOL.  The number of plot twists and surprises still leave me reeling from shock.  Howey masterfully weaves together supple descriptions over haunting dialogue.  I have already talked two of my friends into reading this book.  Simply phenomenal.  Seriously, how many books on amazon carry this many 5 star reviews?  Read this book!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I got this as the FAOTD and it is amazing! I had never heard of Nonograms before, but they are very nice brain teasers. And it's easy to learn with the included tutorial. Highly recommend trying it :)

B007SSDS24|1.0|I was half expecting the Russians to yell \\"Wolverines!\\" when they were shooting the \\"aliens\\".  Who walks around with a jacket made of keys?  Did he just have that laying around?  What is the moment when one realizes, Yea! the Aliens can't kill me if I make a sweater vest of keys!  And bye the way if the alien apocalypse happens in your part of town, don't worry, because any random guy in a submarine can whip you up an extra Microwave gun in about 3 to 4 minutes.... y'know to kill an alien or cook some hot-pockets.
B007UWBGVS|2.0|I find myself skipping a lot of tracks, I wasn't really impressed with this album.  There are a few good songs, sadly I can't get a refund.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This works great as a pocket sharpener to use on a knife just before and after use.  The swing out diamond stick is even useful to throw a touch up on a chainsaw chain if you know how to do it.  For what it is, it is the best one of its kind and I have tried as many as I have been able to find and buy.  It is the perfect thing for a tool box or tackle box for tuning up an edge as well as for backpacking so you can keep a blade sharp as you camp.  A knife's edge, if looked at under magnification has a number of small \\"feathers\\" along it.  These feathers are what make the edge really cut things easily, like really small serrations.  As an edge is used the feather become folded over and misaligned and what this sort of sharpener does well is straighten those back out so they can get back to work.<br /><br />What this will not do is sharpen a knife once it has become truly dull.  When the feathers eventually have been bent back and forth so  many times the fall/break off, the knife has become truly dull and now you need to really sharpen it.  This sharpener may be able to handle this but in the time it would take to do it you would be much better served to learn to use a stone or buy something like a Sharpmaker type sharpener to do this rather than try and do it with one of this sort of sharpener.  They really are meant just to keep thing going between real sharpenings and not for actually sharpening a dull knife.<br /><br />Since it does what it is intended to do and does it really well, I give it all five stars.
0385737955|5.0|This is one of the best trilogies I have ever read! I would definitely recommend this series to anyone and everyone! While \\"The Maze Runner\\" is a little on the slow side (comparatively) there are so many questions, twists and turns in the books that you want to keep turning pages. I found it almost impossible to put these books down. Each chapter is short but contains so much it's a great read!!!!
B007P6VM04|3.0|The dvd is fine .. but i am very disappointed that the disc container is broken.  both hinge nipples are gone.

B0060AY85C|5.0|This novel was definitely up to Toni Morrison's standards of excellent writing, with  characters that tug at your heart strings.<br />Her usage of first and third  person make the story interesting, and adds color to the characters and the environment.<br />I love how her novels always use strong imagery, and come back full-circle in the end, for satisfying closure.<br /><br />This is worth your time to read- its pretty short, so won't take too long. Enjoy!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|enjoy playing this game. its very entertaining,  and keeps you commingled back to check your progress..... try it!!! you'll love it too!!! :)
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I first started reading Jack Reacher novels a year ago, when I got my first Kindle . This is one of the best mystery series I have ever read. Lee Child has a writing style like Robert Parker, Robert Pronzini and Lawrence Block. ; all of those authors combine great plot, compelling characters and deliberate diction that keeps you turning every page. I would highly recommend that you read every novel in the Jack Reacher series-- you will not be disppointed.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Chose this based on the rave reviews - it did not disappoint!! A must have for iPad and tablet users!
0307951529|3.0|I have started and run four small business.  When I first jumped into The $100 Startup, I was very impressed with the concept and where Guillebeau started to go with the book.  As I got into the meat of the program, though, it started to feel much more like a news reporter's broadcast of starting a business than the notes of someone who's done it.<br /><br />For example, in Moving On Up (I would contend one of the most important chapters of the book), Guillebeau makes an excellent outline of where the startup needs to focus for growth.  Then he fails to detail critical points like A/B testing, which may not be familiar to the intended audience of this title.  He furthermore editorializes with statements like, \\"your conversion rate can be 30% or higher\\" (p.191) with no reason or reference beyond his own say-so, which undermines the integrity of the surrounding prose with their unsupported presumption.<br /><br />Overall I think Guillebeau does a brilliant job of balancing rah-rah storytelling with practical planning.  Where The $100 Startup falls short (though I hope will be amended in an updated version or future title) is increasing details on what the would-be entreprepeur needs to know for execution (the technical aspects), while editing out some of the hyperbolic rhetoric and promises.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Of course, we all know the Hunger Games. Read the book. Loved the movie, but have you continued in the trilogy against Panem? The next installment is Catching Fire, which, at first, seems to drag a bit and get somewhat confusing with the sudden reappearences of some crucial characters--but you'll eventually get over that. When the book pulls you more into its story with Katniss, Peeta and their love on a train across all the districts of Panem, trust me, it begins to get good and gripping. more violence, rebellion, fire and a show to put on. The book gets even better when events that I won't say happens, and I was literally gripping my seat near the end of the book. Loved the book, gripping, twists and turns everywhere you go, and, yes, even more romance. (Sorry if you love Gale.) Great plot and actually had a bit of humor, though I do not agree this is better than the first, it still was really worth my time and entertained me very well!!!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|All I have to say is that this app is perfect to download music. It is also the perfect youtube viewing app. The guys who made this aced it!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Have this on both my Xoom and my HTC Thunderbolt and it works great on both devices. Although,  I must say that I enjoy it much more  on the larger tablet, especially for the 15 and 20 grids. The squares are a bit small. The zoom feature helps, but on the phone there's  a lot of panning. The tutorial isn't good and I haven't found  a way to get hints.  I did discover that if you do a long press on a square, a circle appears around your finger and you can swipe across a row to fill it. I am on the second level on my Xoom and half way through  the first  level  on my Thunderbolt. Great game.

The contents of the group never cease to amaze with the best drumming and bass and Mike's leads are spot on toneful, and to the point, excellent accents with keyboards, guitars and other instruments and backing vocals. Just showing off to the world they are the best Rock and Roll Band on the planet!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|When I started reading this book I had heard a few things about it but was unsure what it was all about.  Once I started reading I was back and forth about what the book was really about or trying to say.  After a while I just gave up and decided it was like a Twilight read and was basically transporting you into a world that is not talked about.  I was a little shocked how racy it was, and thought at quite a few moments that this main character, Ana, was pretty stupid.  Over all I don't think it was written to be taken very seriously.  Just an escape to take you out of your everyday life for a little while.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I am almost done with this novel and I'm amazed that I really like it.  I don't usually read Vampire or Witch novels but the story really caught my interest from the first page. I totally disagree with the reviewer who though this was not an adult book.  The author has put a lot of detail both historic and fictional into the story.  Younger readers may have a hard time keeping up with all the discussion around DNA, etc.  This is certainly not a conventional Romance novel and can appeal to readers of many different genres.

B004EBZX6W|5.0|I found several good uses for this application: at home and while traveling.<br /><br />The application has several screens that provide different information. My favorite view is the third screen, the one with the bar display. This is my default view, once you choose this view the next time you start an app it will come up displaying that view.<br /><br />In this view the length of the bar indicates the strength of the signal. The icon on the left shows you whether the channel is open or secured. My tablet is WiFi only, so when I travel it is very handy to quickly see if there are any open WiFi networks and which one of them is the strongest.<br /><br />Another piece of information that is useful is the channel. This is the setting that is useful at home where you can control which channel you are using. If you see that you are sharing the same channel with several other people you can switch which channel your router is using to broadcast WiFi and get a stronger signal.  To figure out what is the best option  use View #4 (details below).<br /><br />The other views that I use less often are:<br /><br />The first view  is the graph chart that shows you the strength of all WiFi signals.<br />The second view shows you a meter that shows your the strength of your network.<br />The third one (my favorite) is described above in detail.<br />The forth one shows the channel in your area with stars indicating the best reception.  This view is useful if view 3 shows you that you are sharing the channel with many people and you decide to switch.  This screen will help you to choose the best alternative.<br />View 5 shows color coded chart of activity for all local to you WiFi networks. At the top you see a legend for the color-coding. What you want to see that your WiFi line does not cross any other lines, as this would indicate no noise from your neighbor's networks.<br /><br />This app works well on my Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet running Android HoneyComb.

B00001NTXN|5.0|A concept as simple as checkers, but with a twist that demands the use of strategy and thinking ahead. My 5 and 8-year-old girls really dug it from the start, when they were both just focused on getting to the other side of the door. But when the 5-year-old won the first game, the 8-year-old realized that she had to put her thinking cap on, and started making her decisions a few moves ahead. That's when the real fun began. If you're starting to think this may be a good way to transition them into chess, then we're on the same page; I suspect the same thing. Meanwhile, this is a really enjoyable game in and of itself, inspiring heartfelt groans, pledges of retaliation and genuine feelings of accomplishment. And the fact that it's a well-constructed board with beautiful stained wood pieces adds a great deal to the value. I have a feeling we'll be playing this one for a long time.

B002GHHHPQ|5.0|If you have a love for the B-17 flying fortress of WWII and wish to fly along on a mission, this is the movie for you.  The entire movie is wonderful, there are a few fake looking moments but they used either 3 or 5 old B-17s during making of this film and a couple of ME109 German fighter aircraft also...the costumes appear to be spot on.  The singing of Danny Boy by Harry Connick Jr is great and takes you back into the war years (early 1940s).<br />I wish I knew a bit more about the armaments on the aircraft but the entire thing is believable, and is based on true events.<br />I highly recommend this movie for all WWII buffs, military buffs, and B-17 buffs.<br />Would give it 10 stars were they available.

B005HV6Y5W|4.0|MOVIE RATING:  4 stars (B+)<br /><br />One of the most mysterious and interesting auteur filmmakers out there right now is director Terrence Malick. No one else seems to inspire as many rumors, stories and myths about what they are up to as Malick. When will we see a new film from him? What will the film be about? What's the title of the film? Malick's movies tend to languish in the news for years simply titled as \\"Untitled Terrence Malick Film\\". But 2011 saw the birth, both literally and figuratively, of a brand new Malick movie: The Tree Of Life (2011). This is only Malick's fifth film in a career spanning over 40 years. But his five films are iconic pieces of filmmaking art. I've seen them all and I highly recommend you see each and every one to really understand any one of them. They cling together with a web of subliminal meaning that has taken me years to contemplate. My favorite, hands down, is The Thin Red Line (1998), the most masterful look at war, and man for that matter, ever made. It's one of my Top 10 movies of all time. It took me years and repeated viewings to fully appreciate it.<br /><br />Like all of Malick's films, upon first viewing The Tree Of Life (in the theater a year ago), I was confronted with reconciling my very high expectations for the film with the actual film that Malick delivered. It's taken a year of simmering inside me to really figure out how I feel about it. And after viewing it in its entirety for a 2nd time on blu-ray recently, I feel ready to discuss the film and my thoughts and feelings about it. While The Tree Of Life still makes me question its meaning and intentions, I appreciate it a little more than during my first time. It's a movie that makes it hard for me to love because it goes way outside the box of normal narrative storytelling. I love strong dialogue driven movies. And The Tree Of Life is not that kind of movie. In fact, this movie probably has less dialogue than any other feature length movie I love. But the subtext in the visuals, music, and feel of the film really got into me during this second viewing because my expectations of wanting dialogue and narrative were gone. Instead of constantly waiting for the movie to give me what I want, like I did the first time, I accepted it for what it is and got something else. Looking back on all 5 of Malick's movies now, I can see that they all do the same thing. None of them delivered what I wanted or expected from them the first time I saw them. But after letting that go, I was able to appreciate them on subsequent viewings. My initial rating for The Tree Of Life was 3.5 stars but I've since updated it to 4 stars.<br /><br />I'm not going to try to provide a narrative summary or character descriptions for this film since it really means nothing to understanding this film. Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Sean Penn and the three young boys (Hunter McCracken, Laramie Eppler, and Tye Sheridan) who play Pitt and Chastain's sons are all fantastic in their performances. They are not showy performances with scene-chewing speeches, but they are powerfully quiet and subtle performances rooted in deep character development. It's so clear that they all lived in the shoes of their characters during production on this movie. Malick's style of shooting demands that anyways from what I understand. I think Malick really nailed the casting on this film. Pitt and Chastain couldn't be more different yet complimentary in their roles as universal representations of \\"nature\\" and \\"grace\\". They just work together in this story. I actually think the 3 boys did the most with their roles. Their very naturalistic performances really brought my own childhood memories and feelings to life through their eyes.<br /><br />As with every Malick film, the production design, cinematography, sound, music, and editing are simply the best. I don't know what else to say. There's no room for improvement in any of those areas and the craftsmanship on this movie is really beyond perfection, even though I know that's not possible. But that's the experience I get. It really is astounding to see Malick and his incredible team provide such a meticulous and beautiful film. It has a natural and organic feel to it, yet I know that every single frame of the film and second of sound has been masterfully thought about by someone. Somehow Malick's style of filmmaking follows all the rules and breaks all the rules at the same time. When it comes to pure technical filmmaking craft, I give The Tree Of Life 5 stars out of 5. It's only the story and the writing (assuming there was much), that knocks this film down a start for me. But it wouldn't surprise me that if the \\"secrets\\" of this movie are revealed to me down the road, that I upgrade my score.<br /><br />While I could go on and on talking about the details of this movie, I think it's best to let it speak for itself beyond what I've had to say so far. The ideas, lessons, questions, and queries that I think it poses can't really be talked about. I believe one has to internalize them like all philosophy, psychology, and spirituality. They're are no real answers in my mind from The Tree Of Life to the questions it asks. It's the questions that are the meat of it's meal.nd perfection, even though I know that's not possible.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|I was really excited about reading this book after seeing the video that promotes it!!.. I liked the book, can't say I love it!. It was to slow paced for my taste, I was expecting more excitement or action, but I never got it. I loved the concept of the Circus, I loved the love story in it but I think more could have been done, even the ending though thrilling fell a little flat. I am gonna give it 4 stars because aside of what I think it was lacking I enjoyed it at some level.
B001R22TBI|5.0|A beautiful collection of soothing, whimsical songs from this incredibly talented young artist. Melua's voice fills the room and it's rather like being wrapped in a silken shawl. A perfect array of her work has been chosen here from the haunting 'Tiger in the Night' to her brilliant rendition of The Cure's 'Just Like Heaven'. If this is your first dose of Katie Melua, it will make you want to rush out to get your hands on her entire body of work. There is no one like her.

B007N0REX6|5.0|Slash delivers a consistently hard-rocking solo album that's far better than his first.  \\"Anastasia\\" may be Slash's best song since his Gn'R days, with an incredible opening riff, driving groove, and excellent solos.  And Slash shows that he can deliver driving riffs on standouts \\"Shots Fired,\\" \\"Apocalyptic Love,\\" and lead single \\"You're A Lie.\\"  Sharp, driving and deadly.  Go ahead and try not to bang your head to the machine-gun rhythm & chorus of  \\"Shots fired, out of range, they wanna see me in a blood-soaked grave, but still I live to die another day!\\"<br /><br />Although sometimes Myles Kennedy sometimes struggles to keep up (e.g. One Last Thrill, Halo), he delivers a soulful performance on the excellent ballad \\"Not For Me,\\" where his strong vocal presence propels Slash to one of the better solos on the album -- and is topped off by a call-and-response vocal/guitar ending.  Similarly, \\"No More Heroes\\" is fueled by an amazing Slash guitar tone and strong chorus that suggest that this could be the beginning of bigger things for Slash & Myles.  Overall, great stuff!
B004RFYEEC|5.0|Although I've owned this big box set since it first came out, I've taken my time reacting to it.  And time, it seems, has confirmed the crucial-- no, cosmic-- contribution of the Beach Boys to the music of the past half-century.  This set belongs in archival collections everywhere for the study (and ultimate exasperation) of musical scholars everywhere.  SMiLE fanatics who have collected or compiled bootlegs over the past 20 or more years will probably want the big box, too:  even for them, there are some nice surprises.  For Beach Boys fans otherwise, or for those not prepared to pay such a steep price, the 2-CD edition should more than suffice.  My comments apply generally to both sets.<br /><br />1.  This is not the SMiLE album.  As many other reviewers have pointed out, SMiLE was a Beach Boys project undertaken from late 1966 through mid-1967 that ended as a train wreck whose non-appearance derailed their careers for years afterward and permanently curtailed Brian Wilson's lofty ambitions.  What we have on Disc 1, tracks 1-19 is essentially the stage show cleverly put together by Brian and his cohorts for a series of performances and documented on the 2004 CD \\"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE.\\"  The knock against that one, fine as it was, is that it wasn't the Beach Boys (a legitimate knock, IMO).  The knock against this one is that it remains a stage show, a collection of songs arranged into three movements.  The songs themselves are brilliant, often transcendent, but as an \\"album,\\" the whole is less than the sum of its parts, far from the modular production style Brian was pioneering in 1966.  Had he realized his ambition at that time, although we'll never know what the vinyl LP would have been, I feel sure it would have been something quite beyond a mere collection of songs.  As \\"Good Vibrations\\" is less a song than a \\"pocket symphony,\\" SMiLE would have challenged the idea of \\"song\\" by extending the concept to album length.  The session excerpts on the remaining discs often bear out the intended \\"wholeness\\" of SMiLE, where nearly any fragment could be reflected or repeated elsewhere in the album.<br /><br />2.  The track I return to most is on Disc 1, track 25, an 8+ minute compilation of Beach Boys backing vocals.  No other vocal group, then or now, could conceive, much less perform, these astonishing excerpts.  The track also serves to remind us that SMiLE, much more so than Pet Sounds, was a Beach Boys project, not a Brian Wilson confessional.<br /><br />3.  Another plus for the big box set.  However often repeated-- \\"Heroes and Villains,\\" parts 1 and 2, \\"Vegetables,\\"  and others, they are almost never duplicates of each other, so there are many unexpected shifts within songs.  Nice, too, to have the stereo versions on the final LP side, though, as other reviewers have complained, the vinyl pressings are not all that they could have been.<br /><br />4.  The \\"fly-ins\\"-- material borrowed from sessions other than the originals and synced-up to the original backing tracks-- I find rather bothersome on several levels.  For one thing, the producers are inconsistent:  while it makes sense to use Carl Wilson's lead vocal, recorded in 1968, on \\"Cabinessence,\\" why not include the 20/20 album's enhanced version of \\"Our Prayer,\\" at least as an appendix?  \\"Barnyard\\" and \\"I'm in Great Shape,\\" with their extraneous vocals, do not add much interest.  As for \\"Surf's Up,\\" with Brian's lead vocals properly in sync with the backing track and added enhancements from the album version:  it works, but the jury is still out as to whether I really like it.<br /><br />5.  Couldn't the producers have isolated Dennis Wilson's recitation--still all but inaudible-- behind the second chorus of \\"Cabinessence\\"?<br /><br />All cavils notwithstanding, it would be a travesty to rate this set with anything less than the highest recommendations.  SMiLE remains the pivotal point of the Beach Boys' career, and it remains a mystery yet on so many levels.  I hope this set remains in print forever.

B004YF6MHW|2.0|Usually I like to be fair with my reviews. However. This one needs to be noted.<br /><br />The camera is fine, I like it because I have more options than the built in one. However, when you switch to video it uses the built in video app. Which isn't a problem EXCEPT... When you're done taking a video of say, your child's Kindergarten celebration which will only EVER happen once in their life and they perform a little song and it just completely tugs at your heart and is very sweet and special to you... and you accidentally double-tap the backout button on your phone... Most NORMAL and RESPONSIBLE apps (Responsible in terms that the programmers who make them KNOW WHAT THE **** THEY'RE DOING) automatically save what you JUST recorded to flash and back out. Not ZOOM FX, when you stop the recording, it ASKS you, SAVE or DISCARD. REALLY? How stupid beyond all measure is that? If I want to delete it I'll go into the gallery and delete it, Even a moron with a 60 IQ would figure that you would want to save what you recorded initially, and then go and delete it later if you don't want it.<br /><br />Thanks. Thanks for CHANGING the way the default app performs where if I use it with the native camera app, and I stop recording, HEY it saves it and I can go in later and delete. NOT Zoom FX. You have to ask... Want to save this? DERP.<br /><br />Just INCENSED at the moment.

0553807919|3.0|I've had a shift in perspective about parenting recently. Not because of this book but because of life's valleys and pits. So now much of this book comes across as an exercise in self-pleasure that I find obnoxious.  Today I would not order it.  And I wish I hadn't.  While it holds a wealth of interesting information I don't like the tone of the book because I think it feeds into parents  fears and is an ego stroker of a book.

If you believe Fillmore East and Eat a Peach represent particular landmarks in the band's history, well how's about a recording made between 'em?  Yep, the \\"You Don't Love Me\\"/\\"Soul Serendade\\" is on the Dreams set, but the rest is available only on bootlegs and tapes, far as I know, and this collection is worth the money.  Wish it was on the band's label, but the sound quality is quite good, and hearing Duane and Berry hittin the note is always so fine.  If you know the tunes, y'all gonna appreciate the subtle differences, the little fills, the variations.  This is the music of our lives -- hear it a new way.

0142419400|5.0|This is one of those books that grabbed me from the beginning and made me love the characters so hard that I couldn't stop reading. Stephanie Perkins' writing is fun and witty and she got me firmly inside Anna's head as she's dealing with a whole new culture, all new friends and one very sexy boy who could be more than a friend if the stars align. *swoon*<br /><br />Anna... Oh, Anna. I really did love this girl. She's lovely and sweet and she's thrown for a loop when her parents ship her off to a foreign country without giving her any say in the matter. I know that I would have been petrified to be in a strange place where I couldn't speak the language so Anna's first week of school really struck a chord with me. Her slow evolution from a girl afraid to leave the school campus into someone who routinely strikes out on her own felt very real to me. Her slow romance with St. Clair was both nerve wracking and incredibly sweet. I wanted them to get together so badly and it was hard watching St. Clair cling to his old girlfriend just because she was something he was comfortable with.<br /><br />I honestly put this book down and immediately started eyeballing book 2 because I was so very in love with both the world Stephanie Perkins created and with her writing. This was simply one of those books that made me smile and, at points, get a little teary eyed. <3 <3 <3<br /><br />-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal

B007OAAK0O|3.0|No one enjoys performing for their audiences more than Diana Ross. She loved the stage and the stage loved her.  But enough with audience participation. Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh. The greatest concert ever on Earth is Diana Ross' \\"The Boss\\" concert in 1979 from Caesar's Palace. This concert, in 1983 I believe, was good, but for the fact that she stopped singing and asked the audience to finish verses and stanzas. Enough audience participation already. If she just asked the audience to sing on \\"Reach Out and Touch Somebody's Hand\\" like she did in the 79 concert, that would have been fine. But on every song? I did not buy this dvd(actually I bought 2, in case one gets worn) to hear the audience sing on every song. Diana stopped singing on so many of her hit songs, and held the mic out for the audience to finish verses. The throngs loved her almost as much as I did(do).<br /><br />This is the only reason I gave this dvd 3 stars, not her performance. Her performance was five stars. The quality of the dvd was five stars. I was into every song. I love Diana Ross. And that is who I paid to hear, not Bob, Roetha, Rodeshia, Clarise, Mary, Bobby, Johnson, Patrick,Carlos...........
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is my first experience with this type of puzzle app. I love it. Level 1.6 can be completed contrary to what one reviewer wrote. It is very addicting. I would highly recommend this app to anyone.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|I downloaded it because it was the free app of the day and looked interesting. Little did I know the hours I would spend playing!<br /><br />It's a great twist on the old memory game, and more fun. The only knock on it is that in Survival mode, you can't add health past a certain point no matter how many matches you make.
B00003CXA6|4.0|This movie is very long, and could get boring to someone who has small interest.  If you have no interest in civil war details, it's not for you.  Excellent acting, good battle scenes
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Absolutely excellent book!!!  This book can change your life.  I found myself highlighting so much in the book.  I plan on reading it again.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Ignore the haters. get this app. you can use it for whatever. but I use it for a journal... it really does help get your feelings out. I have never used a journal but I like this. so thanks for making this app. give this app a shot! ^_^
193413712X|5.0|In his 1946 lecture Existentialism is a Humanism, Jean-Paul Sartre strikes a familiar existentialist chord:  the world is absurd in that it conforms to nobody's will and cannot be relied upon to further even the most sincere and fervent of aims. Sartre writes:<br /><br />For there is no God and no prevenient design,which can adapt the world and all its possibilities to my will. When Descartes said, \\"Conquer yourself rather than the world,\\" what he meant was, at bottom, the same - that we should act without hope.<br /><br />To face the absurdity of the world is to live in what Sartre calls \\"despair.\\"  One seldom faces it, soldiering on as if one could make the world ones own, could order it according to the rational structures one has been taught to embrace, could weave it seamlessly into the auto-narrative that is ones life.  In Tinkers the heroic, futile, irrationally faithful efforts of the characters to create themselves as fathers, sons, mothers, wives are chronicled by Paul Harding.  With wisdom, gentleness, and love he reveals the deeply and intensely felt yearnings of characters beset by their own infirmities, the vicissitudes of the \\"riotous\\" natural world, and the failures of their flawed theories of mind.<br /><br />To be human is to be confronted with one's conscious will and the inescapable fact that one must create oneself.  One can attempt to obliterate the gap between oneself and nature, as when Howard attempts to lose himself, Zen-like, in a meadow or a pond; or one can accept the gap pretending, ala George, that the world can be drawn or constructed according to ones own designs, like a blueprint or a clock.  Or one can, at ones own peril, ignore the gap, living as Howard's father did, in a narrative that floats farther and farther above natura firma until it bursts like a soap bubble, into noiseless insubstance.  Tinkers is about living in the gap.  We are born to need each other, doomed by the nature of selves to live alone.  So the space in whichwe live is not just between the conscious will and nature, but between ourselves and other selves.  Kathleen cannot unite herself with her husband or her children: she constructs a rigid parental grid in which to keep her sons and daughters and a wordless, impenetrable wall behind which to banish her broken husband.  Howard mistakes his wife's silence for an unspoken agreement founded in mutual love; and Howard, unable to bear the pain his affliction visits on his son never brings himself to touch the boy with his love.<br /><br />For some, life in the gap is too much and they are left insane, or resentful, or spent.  Others manage to create and sustain mirages that are close enough to reality that they come apart only when their creators are too weak to sustain them any longer.  Then they come crashing down like the roof and floors of the dying George's house, leaving shards which can never be reassembled because their unity was, after all, the grandest part of the illusion.<br /><br />Tinkers is about what Harding calls \\"the deep and secret yes,\\" about the utter existential impossibility of being human juxtaposed against the brave, precious, faith that the impossible can transcend itself.<br /><br />An exquisite artist whose medium is words, Harding's specialty is pastoral landscapes and the portraits of the souls who occupy them.  He saturates the page with color (a master of silver hues and textures) and paints with light every bit as well as the most accomplished oil or acrylic artist.  Harding's novel is at once a celebration of the spirit and grace of the natural world and a penetrating psychological homage to the individual human being and his foibles.  Tinkers is a lovely and heart-wrenching thing of beauty.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Headset is perfect for what I was looking for.  It's very comfortable and the sounds comes through great.<br />I use it for my aviation games.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|I got this after hearing them over and over on the alternative station...so I decided to get the album, and I am not disappointed in the least. This is a great record! Each and every song is catchy, and just a fun song to listen to....great CD for traveling, or just hanging out! I would definately get another Black Keys album!
0345803485|1.0|Erotica.........badly written erotica I honestly do not understand how this book got published. I wish I could at least say its a guilty pleasure type book but I cant. Its just simply horrible.
0345803485|5.0|Sexy. Lush. Romantic. Honestly, one of my favorite books.  I was euphoric that this was a trilogy-- I could not get enough.  If you want an arousing and amorous experience, were putting the book down is unthinkable, then you must read '50 Shades of Grey' (trilogy). Your husband will thank you when you wake him in the middle of the night to take your passions out on him-- it is that tempting and sultry!<br /><br />For some readers, the first book may be to amorous and lascivious to continue on, but I suggest you keep going.  The second and third installments grow more romantic and passionate.  Questions will arise and answers will avail, making the relationship between the two protagonists seem more plausible and appropriate.<br /><br />I believe the mass hysteria over this trilogy is simply Christian Grey.  This trilogy will introduce you to one of the most desirable men in contemporary literature.  Like him or not, his seductive lure is palpable.  Christian Grey is the epitome of fantasy and sex personified.<br /><br />For those of you who have never read a book in the BDSM genre, this is a soft and mild introduction to the lifestyle without feeling impure and soiled.  Exquisitely entertaining, I highly recommend this trilogy.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Well, from reading the reviews on this book I got the impression that everyone has strong opinions about it.  I didn't really form a strong opinion about it.  It just seemed like an average book with mediocre writing that everyone suddenly when nuts over.  It's mildly entertaining but would I could have gotten into the story more if the writing had been better.<br /><br />Everyone already knows what the story is about so I won't bother to reiterate it here but I thought the plot was alright and I could empathize with the characters.  It's not horrible and it's not great.  It's also not worth the price.  If I were going to do it over, I'd wait until the price dropped by about half before I bought it.  Or looked for it at a garage sale.  I'd still read it though.  FWIW.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great for simple math. use it for bills and calculating my budget.quick and to the point over all good app

1451629184|5.0|First off let me just say that for Jaycee Dugard to open up and share with the world about what happened to her is one of the bravest things that I've ever heard of.  I remember when this happened.  I remember the news reports on TV about her being kidnapped and then came the news reports that she had been found, alive.<br />To read this and to find out what happened to her within all of those years was shocking, yet beautiful.  By beautiful I mean that she took the best of a bad situation and made the best of it.  She always had the hope that she would see her mother and baby sister again.<br />This book is at times hard to read because she goes into detail of the sexual abuse at the hands of her kidnapper, but it's essential so that we, the reader, can understand what she had gone through.  The control that this man had over her.<br />I'm giving this book to my mother to read next and I'm recommending it to everyone who faces challenges in life and thinks there is no hope.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I finished part 1 and jumped right into part 2, and on my way to getting part 3. I cannot get enough of these two. It has a good story line to it. It is a touching story at the same time, freaky, crazy, but it makes you just want more and more. This is a book or a Trilogy that I would read again and definitely recommend. My mother-in-law is reading this book, so is my mother, my sister and a few of my friends. Mr. Grey is one heck of a man!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not sure how amazon is giving this an average customer rating of three and a half out of four stars. I waded through page after page of one star, this book is garbage, reviews. Regardless, walk away. The content isnt offensive, the poor writing ability is.
B004QOB8SO|3.0|I am a huge fan of the show, and I doubt the producers will read this but we need more extras on these CD sets.  There are no out takes, deleted scenes, video diaries -- just one 'general' interview about the series that has been on YouTube for months.  Russell Tovey is embarassing doing the commentary for Baskerville episode, asking Moffett and Gatiss if they've read all the SH stories?  Come on!<br /><br />Moffett and Gatiss know how well produced the Doctor Who CD sets are, we need more of that kind of material!  Us fans have to wait soooooo looooong between series, we deserve the extras.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I LOVE FRIENDS!  So, I'm a tad bias when it comes to this set of DVD's.  I loved the whole series and the funniest thing is that I got my husband hooked on it who had never seen an episode before! :)
B001992NUQ|5.0|I really want to rate this one star because that is what tyler would have wanted. I love this movie, totally worth the 9.99 blu-ray price!
0984999302|1.0|I don't understand why we're supposed to import expensive paper from another country instead of just downloading the knowledge script.<br />Is there a chapter saying ebook readers don't deserve this content? Does it say digital format takes longer to not print?<br />Is it a law problem?<br />Is it a smart strategy?
B00261VZKA|5.0|I am still in awe of the bravery and faith of those who suffered during the reformation. I can only imagine what tremendous courage they must have had and it makes me feel particularly insignificant in comparison. This episode is special and Jeremy Northam's portrayal of Sir Thomas More is extremely moving.

B005K2YRVG|5.0|I purchased the this cover and was very happy with it and it protects the kindle well.  This cover fits the Kindle Touch like a glove.  Other people claim it doesn't fit, but I can't help wonder if they  tried using this cover with a different model of Kindle.  I RECOMMEND THIS ITEM.
B000E41MRC|5.0|In 1934, Adolph Hitler's National Socialist Party was in power in Germany, but not yet in total control of the country.  Hitler commissioned actress and director Leni Riefenstahl to film the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, which was to be used as a propaganda film inside and outside of Germany, to entice more of the German population to support the Nazi party, or at least consider it as a viable alternative to other parties. The resulting \\"documentary\\" was called \\"Triumph of the Will\\".<br /><br />The film was legitimately very popular in Germany when released in 1935 ... purportedly one of the top three films of the year.  In a way, the film is similar to the Democratic and Republic national conventions held during the presidential election cycles; the production is carefully staged, with many speakers, a unifying theme, and attempts to convince the outside viewers of the \\"rightness\\" of its positions.  However the scale of the Nazi Party Congress was vast, with upwards of one million Germans attending, as opposed to the few thousands that might attend the national conventions, and the tone much, much more beligent.<br /><br />The film can be viewed in several ways.  First, as a documentary record of the 1934 Nazi Party Congress.  To today's audience, I would have to say it would be tedious and dull when viewed in this context.  Other than for the novelty of seeing and hearing Hitler and his cronies speak, the film wouldn't offer the casual viewer much in the way of entertainment.<br /><br />Second, as a historical microcosm of what was happening in Germany in 1934, from the Nazi party's stated agenda to viewing a small slice of German life from that time period.  The movie is more interesting when viewed that way.  If you're a World War II buff, or a historian of the time frame, all of the German bugaboos are on display, from racial purity to threatening to crush any enemies that stand in their way.  And the fervor of the German's attending the congress isn't being faked ... this was a meeting of the believers, and it showed.<br /><br />Finally, and most importantly, this film can be viewed as the technical masterpiece that it is.  Although it looks trite and repetitive by today's standards, many of the techniques used today were pioneered by Riefenstahl in this film ... moving cameras, low angle shot of important people/events, filming from an aircraft, and so on.  Although the film is not technically perfect ... you can see other cameras in the background and people will occasionally walk in front of a shot ... the fact that it was being filmed \\"live\\" shows what effort and preplanning went into the making of the film.  (Although Riefenstahl did re-film some of the speeches later and edit them back in with the \\"live\\" portions.)  This film is justifiably listed as one of the 100 best films on many lists primarily due to its lasting impact on how films were made.<br /><br />While the message being presented by the film is odious and repugnant, the film itself is both an important historical record and a technical masterpiece.  If you're a World War II buff, you need to watch this film.  Five stars.being faked ... this was a meeting of the believers, and it showed.<br /><br />Finally, and most importantly, this film can be viewed as the technical masterpiece that it is.

B005LAIGNC|1.0|So....no Bluray 3d release? Not buying a 3d movie in 2d. I've searched everywhere and found no mention of a 3d version of this movie. What's the deal with that?
B007ZD17XO|5.0|this game is super addictive.  needed to go to bed but couldn't stop playing.  I would recommend this game to anyone that's looking for a good game.  well worth the money.
B006RA0E5I|5.0|I like both the heavy click sound and the feel (weight, size) of this mouse.<br />Worked rightaway with the batteries in, the switch turned on and the adapter plugged<br />into the usb port of my laptop. The laptop automatically installed a driver in a minute<br />or so and everything was good to go.<br />The look is solid and professional, which complements the Thinkpad I have.<br />The adapter stores inside the mouse, when not in use, which is a pretty cool design.<br />I also downloaded and set up the 'Mouse Suite' software from Lenovo's support site, but<br />didn't make any changes to the functionality of the buttons. Maybe others will find this<br />software useful.<br />The mouse distinctly says 'Lenovo' on it, in bold letters, so for Lenovo laptop users this<br />is fine, but I'm not sure folks with other laptop makes/models will like this.<br />So far, very happy with the mouse.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|cool game I like it lot. I play with my mom every night. Its an easy game to play and we love the characters
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"The Lucky One.\\" I was pulled into the  story from the very beginning and remained on the tip of my toes until the very end. I recommend this book to anyone as it is an easy read and a heartfelt love story. The story of Logan and Beth in their adventure of falling in a small town in North Carolina is charming and will make you believe in the true power of love.  Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer and knows how to keep you wishing the book would never end. PLEASE READ! Also, highly recommend \\"At First Sight\\" and \\"The Rescue.\\"
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is really fun to play.  Great for all ages.  Moves along quickly.  Loads of fun.  I highly recommend this game.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|$5 seems a little steep at first, but keep 2 things in mind: 1) the implementation is awesome, 2) You'd easily pay the price for a puzzle magazine at the store. Since downloading, this app has been slowly taking the place of my sleep at night.
B000002PCS|4.0|This soundtrack is an emotional journey of true love.  It brings back the moment in time when I felt the most love in my life. The music is bone melting and washes all pain away. If you haven't seen this movie...you should do so with someone you love. A true romantic will love having this CD as part of their collection of great music. It is an awsome escape.
B004Y1WCDE|1.0|When this program works, it rocks.  But half the time it doesn't work.  The server will sometimes be mapped, sometimes it'll say offline.  Basically if you want something that you just set up once and not worry about, don't use this.  Worst of all is this thing never seems to work when I want it to (i.e. on vacation, out of the house, whatever).  Great software in theory, execution is terrible.  The app itself is fine, but ultimately worthless when the server software won't work.<br /><br />Piece of junk.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it's. really a fun game I didn't. know about it in till my friend Gracie showed me in the middle of class.
0446563048|5.0|There is so much great 'behind the scenes' info on developing company culture from the ground up.  It's not about creating a successful company just to get rich and that's what makes one happy....  This book is about deeply embedding priceless core values throughout every aspect of your life.  Tony's stories are funny, inspiring, and this read has truly been an enjoyable experience.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it is not as good as the original but fun. my daughter loves playing it with me. I just wish that it responded a little faster to my touches.
B000FC1192|5.0|I really do love this book because it its not the most original book but its spooky and entertaining so it makes me want more like a sequel would be amazing with more crazy twist i personally salute Neil Gaiman for his genious work I mean it is other than the other world pretty original.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|It was 3 o'clock in the morning when I rolled over to find this amazing series playing on my once paused Tivo. I had fallen asleep watching Craig Ferguson but completely woke for this. I loved the actor's portrayal of Sherlock. Sherlock seemed to be what I have always pictured him to be... an Autistic Savaunt who was extremely high functioning. Watson was more integral to the story of Sherlock than he's ever been given credit for, (at least in any of the renditions of the Sherlock Holmes movies or shows I've seen)by being Sherlock's doctor not just some randomly thrown in side kick that is used to express Sherlock's mental superiority. I honestly believe that this is by far the best portrayal of the Sherlock stories and anyone who sees it willl not be disappointed.
B0061S073A|5.0|This app is essential! I NEVER EVER let my son (3 going on 4) play with the kindle without it activated. My son used to play with my Ipod touch but he would delete apps and rearrange everything on it. But with this app I have no worries of that happening to my kindle fire! He can only play with the apps I allow him to use. I can remove apps I feel he may play too much (angry birds ring a bell anyone?) and make more books available. This is a LIFESAVER!! I recommend it to all my friends with Kindle Fires! I would love an option to put ebooks in the selection. Right now only apps can be placed there.<br /><br />Thank you for a fantastic app.

B003Y5H5HO|3.0|Initially I thought this is a different story in the one directed by Oplev I first saw in 2010 (I believe was an euro version). Turns out it is an american remake of the same story. I don't remember if all the details are the same, but some of the more disturbing scenes are.<br /><br />I think the main actress is better looking in the euro version. On the otherhand, daniel craig is better looking than Michael Nyqvist.<br /><br />The story is ok, but I think a little more explanation would help the audience follow the plot. A few times the movie would show some clues and then the actor's face lit up like he/she noticed something. OK, what? Sometimes it is explained later and sometimes not. Like, I still am not sure how the two main characters arrived at the same conclusion to the mystery.
B007SGM084|2.0|There are plenty of great books for Kindle readers that do not cost much at all.  I bought mine for the convenience as much as the cost of the books.  Let's face it, you can read these books without anyone seeing a cover and knowing what you are reading  :). That being said, I need some help with the math on this one ... I can get each book of the trilogy for $9.99 ea, or I can pay $29.99 to get them all in one.  Really? ... you want to charge me $.02 more for this.  For one thing I would never buy all the books at once anyway, I would buy one first to see if I even liked them.

0767817478|4.0|I did love this movie. I just am not certain why. Firstly, is Godrilla radio active or not? The film begins with radio activity pinging off of the first ship Godzilla attacks; again around the foot prints Nick is suppose to study(let us not forget studying radio activity effects is Nick's specialty). And yet once the army and Godzilla arrive in Manhattan, no more mention of radio activity. Why? Well, if they carried forward the radio activity aspect, they could then locate Godzilla in Manhattan pronto....just look for the vast area of that island that is radio active,and bingo, you just found Godzilla. And what about Lucy?! First she tsk tsks Audrey for being a door mat by buying her boss's groceries. Then tsk tsks Audrey for being too bold in asking about a promotion. Then praises her for being bold enough to steal a press pass. Lucy needs to make her mind up. Is Audrey a door mat or brazen self promoter? And FINALLY...why does the army colonel keep demanding Godzilla not be allowed to leave Manhattan. Why? Doesn't  it seems obvious this destroyer of entire city blocks; leveler of world famous skyscrapers, should be driven out to sea to destroy without risking the destruction of a city of three million people? Sure it does. But, there you go again, no Manhattan to destroy, no movie in the first place. It would have been a good idea if the colonel had not mentioned blocking the big green guy's escape. STILL..I can't help myself. I really did love this film. Oh, by the way. Does any one know if there are really enough fish in Manhattan to fill thirteen dump trucks in, say, just a few minutes?
1451648537|3.0|The book is at its best when history is allowed to speak for itself. The interviews with friends and colleagues are very informative and entertaining. But, the book falls flat when the author's prose fills in the gaps. The author is not objective in the slightest. He is very warm and fuzzy when referring to Jobs, in what basically amounts to a novel-length love letter\Apple commercial.... Just let the story speak for itself! If it weren't for this, I would rate this book higher. But around the halfway point, I was so tired of reading the author's opinions (which are very repetitive) that it became a major distraction.<br /><br />I actually do recommend this book, especially for the tech-saavy, because it really is a gripping story at times- and it is a page-turner, despite its size.
0307951529|5.0|There are many books that give you philosophical prose about the semantics of this or that way to conduct business. The thing that strikes me about this book first is the mantra of \\"start today, deposit money tomorrow.\\" That is the fundamental existential statement, right?<br /><br />I have the fortune to know one of the people mentioned, Mr. Benny Lewis. I have know him before this publication. He is a remarkable man, but no more remarkable that any of us. He just found that x factor, that market niche, that vertical channel that he fills so very well. He actually stayed with a friend of mine in Prague, as he learned the language of the Czech Republic.<br /><br />There has never been a better time to be in business than now. Read the book. Seek a mentor. Do it. Not by rote, but by the tenets of this great guide. When good people do good things for the right reasons, they will succeed. This is your road map. This is your glimpse into the fact that those who have gone before you have often been shocked to learn that there is true value in what you do everyday that matters and that you can market.<br /><br />This is a must read for any aspiring entrepreneur.<br /><br />Jonathan Lewis<br />CEO, Black Sun LLC (dba Paper Tigers Publishing)

B0040JHL04|5.0|Bought a pair of these last year & right off the bat I knew I had a great pair of running shoes. Logged in countless long runs and culminated in my first 1/2 marathon. As fall, and about 500 miles logged on the '11's' approached I got the newer GTS 12's. Why Brooks?! Why, oh why did you feel the need to 'improve' on a great shoe? My '12's' seemed to have a small hot-spot up by right big toe after a 5 mile run. Sometimes it would go away, sometimes not so much & I would finish my run w/ a numb right toe. Well I looked on good ole' Amazon & saw that a few pair of the 11's were still available in my size. Rather than one pair I now wish I had elected to buy several more. Right off the bat, you guess it...pure running bliss. The Brooks GTS 11's are a wonderful show that has sadly had its day & has been replaced by the (IMO) inferior GTS 12's.
B007YQ6SYK|5.0|This young man just simply has \\"it\\". I liken the style to Diego Garcia's recent release \\"Laura\\" in that it brings nostalgia without cliche. Good stuff.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was a giant disappointment.  There is barely a plot, the characters are all caricatures of romance fiction 101, and there is absolutely nothing to keep uou from putting the book down.  In fact, I highly recommend you do just that.
0061537969|5.0|A dear friend recommended \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" to me last summer.  I whipped through it in two days and cried real tears, felt real heartbreak at the end.  As I type, this friend is in her last days after a year-long struggle with cancer, leaving behind a wonderful husband and two great kids at only 42 years of age.  During my visit with her yesterday, her dog sat by her side, his head tilted so he could see her, for four hours.  She and I are both relatively new to the world of dogs, both having gotten our first canine pets within the last two years ...and both now firmly in the \\"dogs trump people\\" camp.  Because she turned me on to this book, because of Stein's amazing ability to capture emotion and the unconditional, pure love of dogs for their humans and vice versa, \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" will be one of my favorite books of all time.
0439023521|3.0|Book arrived on tme and in new condition. This book is a bit like Twilight meets 1984, the character developement is simplistic and predictable and is more like a readymade screenplay for tweens/teenagers, blah,!
B007IXGUG0|5.0|I am not the biggest rap fan out there - I like a little bit of everything - except country...  I hate that twang.  Anyway, buy this album, it is great.  It has a bit of everything, and if you are like me you will like that.  So yeah, I am not big on writing CD reviews but I really wanted to give this album a 5 star rating cuz I like it so much and I can listen to the whole album start to finish without wanting to skip a song (except for maybe the \\"back that a.. up\\" remake - I had enough of that song back in the day).
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a fun logic puzzle game.  The only thing I don't like is that once u know what the shape is it is pretty easy.  Still this is fun and I really enjoy it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|decent game! I would recommend it to anyone! I like the fact you can grow food and fish while building a small village.
0439023483|5.0|Almost everyone has read the Hunger Games but if you haven't you MUST.  Great read and all three books are a MUST.  I got the books for a great price on Amazon so take the time and buy them and read them all.  You will not regret it.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This CD is a must for fans of the Bee Gees. It has every song you can think of from them...and more. I never get tired of listening to it.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|The puzzles are challenging and well thought out. However it would have been better if there was an option to not have the crosses. It gets tedious on a small screen to press a square so many times.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really loved this book! It was a fast read that I was able to finish within 2 days. It definitely lives up to the hype!
B0063GORYU|5.0|The app is a fun little free spider game. there are some ads,  but hey, it's free so complaining would be lame
B005LAIGN2|4.0|Although there have been many books and documentaries about the Tuskegee Airmen, my husband and I really enjoyed Red Tails and will gladly add it to our collection of war movies and watch it several more times.  The acting and action were superb and yes, as previous reviewers mentioned, there were some weak links...but we were too absorbed in the story and action to look for the imperfections.  Thank you George Lucas for making the all-around effort to produce a movie telling the story of those wonderful Tuskegee Airmen heroes.  Let's not forget to thank every last one of the actors for a job well done!
0307591549|5.0|If you want to learn about Positive Psychology and you have never been initiated in it, this is the starting point. I come from the Organisational Psychology background which I have taught and practiced in as a Consultant,  since the early 1980s.  I have been looking for a way of teaching successful people how to become more successful. This book is what I have been looking for. After reading it, I am also convinced that I can plan to teach positive psychology at graduate school in my University without fear of promoting a view without a solid foundation.<br /><br />Interestingly, you do not need a psychology background to learn from this book.  Any one who thinks that he/she has been working too hard without \\"achieving results\\" can profit from it.<br /><br />I read the Kindle version and enjoyed the book immensely.  The book has fascinated me enough to take off time to praise it. This is the first Amazon item to motivate me to share my feelings. It is great.<br />Thank you Shawn
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy is amazing, I wish there was another book in the series that I could read.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so awesome and fun!!!I'm addicted to it!!!!!<br />it has got all of the games you would want to play when your bored!! and it is fun for both genders and any age!!!
B000HF2NTE|4.0|One of the best police action movies that ive seen in a long time....Had a good plot and special effects
B005BDZLYQ|4.0|The value is clearly there.  Eight sometimes hard-to-find albums from Mobley's best period for so little. Don't understand why they cut off the last second or two of each song.  More than a little annoying, that.  I'm not sure I'd be inclined to buy any more Real Gone Jazz releases. Also, if you want alternate takes, go elsewhere.  You can't fit two albums on a CD and still have room for alternate takes. Well, tons of good music here.  I'm still listening and still enchanted.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|A great read. Well researched, balanced and written. Gives you insight you wouldn't think was possible. Read this to know more about US presidents.
0767821769|5.0|Well, obviously Julia Roberts and the great Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris are going to give stellar performances in every movie.  This movie was great and I loved it.  For all those who felt sorry for the mother, remember they pointed out SHE kicked HIM out for working so hard, and of course the houses that both live in are fantasy places that only multimillionaires could afford.  But there you go--if you are going to get this rich you have to work around the clock, it's just a fact of life.  It comes down to two women who were excellent in their roles and I loved the fact that the director forced us to feel annoyed and love both characters in their own way.  It's really well worth picking up at a garage sale or renting from the library.  The kids played brilliantly and I am truly surprised that they did not become stars as adults.  For all of you who complained that the 12 year old girl was annoying, you must not be around 12 year old girls.  They are beginning puberty and they are ALL difficult and annoying even without faced with these heartbreaking situations.  Well worth a look.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|would be a 5 star game if not for the energy ratio.  everything requires tons of energy but there is no way to acquire it easily.
B007MDB71O|4.0|Perhaps no author influenced me more as young child, who discovered A Princess of Mars and subsequently Tarzan, than Edgar Rice Burroughs--one of the founding fathers of the sci-fi fantasy genre.It sparked my own imagination along with the Conan books to write fantasy myself. I waited more than fifty years to see the barsoom novels come to life in movie form. Though I would have preferred the movie to have adopted the more somber tone of the books and been more\\" grounded \\" like Lord of the Rings, I enjoyed it immensely. Everyone please buy the dvds and force Disney to get a more accomplished director and do the sequel Gods of Mars which was a stupendous story with a climatic battle for the ages.[[ASIN:B007055JQ8 Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series]]
B0037XPP84|5.0|While I am not a history buff and do not seek out history books to read as recreation I found this movie to be interesting and as a result started doing some research on the history of that era. The movie as stand-alone entertainment is far superior to the first movie in this series, Elizabeth. The pace of the movie never lagged and the scenery was splendid as it portrayed England during a turbulent period of its history.<br /><br />As I expected, Cate Blanchett did a marvelous job portraying the queen as did the other actors in their roles. The visual effects of the battle with the Spanish Armada were very well done and the scene of Elizabeth encouraging her troops before the battle almost brought tears to my eyes. The audio and video quality is both excellent.<br /><br />There are a number of special features which include one rather grotesque shot of a decapitated head. One problem we encountered involved understanding all the words; it seemed as if the music got louder as the actors started whispering making it very difficult to catch all they were saying. We solved that problem be activating English subtitles; after that we didn't miss a word.<br /><br />The movie provides an exciting evening's entertainment and I recommend it highly.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I was really excited for this game, but I was a bit dissapointed when I found how much levels this has. This doesn't even have danger zone. Great game but heeds to really be updated.
B001NA2NMO|4.0|This movie was a little strange at first but had a great story. The characters were very interesting to watch. The sound was not very good in parts and hard to understand but overall it was 1 hour well spent. The fierce loyalty of the circus performers was captured very well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a lot of fun and you get to play numerous games. I would reccomend it to anyone of all ages.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Well written and entertaining series of books. If you don,t read all three you miss a lot of information about the various characters.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is amazing!!! I liked it so much that I wanted to put a review up (even though my review can't possibly add much to the other 800 5-stars reviews). Wool is a beautifully crafted story. Something everyone should read to see how real talented authors write. But I won't keep going on why Wool is so good, because I believe the other 800 reviews say it much better. But in short, I loved Wool and if you haven't read it yet, you are missing out!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved it. I love historical fiction and this book is a perfect mix between time travel and historical fiction.  The unexpected turns this book takes makes you unable to put it down!  I finished a 1000 page book in 4 days!<br /><br />A must read!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I usually lose interest in games quickly, but I am hooked on this one. I highly recommend it and am glad I was able to snatch it when it was a free app of the day!
B007L96SI6|5.0|As a huge fan of Haley Reinhart since the earliest days of her Season 10 American Idol run, Flask Man has eagerly, hungrily and obsessively anticipated the seductive siren's debut album since her elimination from the show during Top 3 week last May.<br /><br />At times, it seemed as if album day would never come.<br /><br />Beginning with her October move to LA, Haley almost immediately began logging countless hours in the studio, feverishly writing and recording album tracks with some of the music industry's top producers and songwriters. This intensive, 3 month creative period would result in her recording an album that by any measure should be considered an incredible debut effort.<br /><br />It also showed us something we didn't know: Haley is a damn good song writer. She technically may only be 21 years old, but the girl has been infused with music since birth by her parents, who have had their own rock band since before Haley was born. Her knowledge, appreciation and understanding of music history runs deep, and she certainly showed she has the ability to draw from it in the stories she crafts in her lyrics, musical arrangements, and the catchy, sometimes hypnotic melodies of her songs.<br /><br />In interviews, Haley's struggled to define the sound of her album, but usually has settled on saying she was going \\"retro with a modern twist\\". On Listen Up! she was very successful at striking this tricky balance, as the album does have a throwback sound, but is definitely not old-fashioned.<br /><br />Haley's incredible versatility as an artist is also on display, as she successfully infused Motown, disco, rock, reggae, pop, soul, hip-hop, R&B, funk and even some hints of her famed jazz vocal stylings. Of course, no element on the album is more prevalent than Haley's sultry, sexy vocal tones that turn up the heat on virtually every song.<br /><br />When discussing the album, Haley's said she really wanted to make it raw and organic, but, if I have one criticism of Listen Up! it would be that production got a bit heavy-handed at times. I did appreciate some of the production effects, just not the lazy or gratuitous ones. Would have liked Haley's voice left alone more, and adding electronic drum beats and synth strings to certain arrangements only served to detract from her authenticity and allure. My suspicion is the producers decided it would make the album sound more current, but I disagree with this thinking. Haley arranged a great blend of old and new without needing such artificial imposition.<br /><br />That said, from this music lover's perspective \\"Listen Up\\" is a joyous feast for the ears, and will send you on a fantastic ride that can at times blow your mind. How refreshing to have a full 14 track album without any useless filler (you have GOT to buy the deluxe version). I enjoyed listening to Listen Up from beginning to end without ever reaching for the skip track button. VERY well done, Haley! You are truly gifted.<br /><br />Anyway, without further ado, here is my song-by-song review.<br /><br />Oh My! - Expected to soon be released as the 2nd single off the album, \\"Oh My!\\" harkens back to Donna Summer's \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" in the sense that Haley spends much of the song having powerful orgasms. The Motown arrangement is contrasted with deep blaring horns, heavy production, and a ridiculous rap interlude by B.o.B that's obviously a sellout to Top 40 radio. While this tune is certainly catchy and fun, it's also a bit of a noisy mess for me.<br /><br />Free - The first single off the album, Free is about mercifully ending a sour relationship as nicely as possible, and showcases Haley's bluesy, sultry, jazzy tones with minimal production. I particularly love the crashing symbols as she hits her opening verse, and the hard driving drum beat accompanying her vampy stylings. Definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />Liar - A rock/soul vibe with a good back beat and cool phrasing, Haley seems to be willing to tell herself anything she needs to in order to stay with Mr. Wrong.<br /><br />Wasted Tears - A catchy Motown track about recovering from heartbreak, this song hearkens back to early Supremes with lots of horns. Think \\"Where Did Our Love Go\\". A fun song that makes you wanna get up and dance.<br /><br />Undone - A piano ballad straight from the Adele school of heartache. While Haley delivers a rich, heartfelt vocal, the synth strings are sappy and the song gets too whiny and repetitive for my tastes. Not my cup of tea, but if you like melodramatic pop ballads you'll love Undone.<br /><br />Now That You're Here - A retro, 70's disco groove with a soulful vibe, this track gets you up and dancing from start to finish. The light, sexy, breezy flow makes it a song everyone will want to sing and clap along with. I'd say it's the catchiest song on the album, because I can't stop singing it. A love song that makes you want a partner to boogie with.<br /><br />Wonderland - A true retro, Motown throwback, one wonders who she's singing about being her man for the past year and a half? (cough...Stefano...cough) I like it, it's got a nice beat and is a sweet love song, but it gets a bit repetitive with the \\"Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Wonderland\\" chorus.<br /><br />Keep Coming Back - A funky tune about an ex-lover who keeps working his way back again. Shows off Haley's more forceful vocals, and she tosses in a hint of growl for good measure, too! Good change of pace song, but would have liked it better less synthesized. Some cool guitar licks from Haley's father Harry.<br /><br />Hit The Ground Running - Damn, Haley can write some sexy lyrics. This one's about Haley seducing a guy and then dumping his ass when he falls too deep for her. A killer torch song aching for vamp Haley to get the guys hot and bothered with a blues-rock edge instead of the sunny Motown beat. Still sexy and sultry, but catch her live performances of this one. They're so hot.<br /><br />Walking On Heaven - Another classic 70's disco track, on this one Haley's seeing the world through happy, rose colored lenses and is ready to sing and dance about it. I'm only too happy to sing and dance along with her! Synth heavy, but since it's a disco track it seems appropriate.<br /><br />Follow Me - An interesting track. Heavy synthesized distortions are over-the-top, but the reggae is pretty awesome. Not sure how I feel about this one yet.<br /><br />Spiderweb - This haunting, psycho-sexual rock thriller is absolutely mind blowing. I found myself addicted from the first listen, and consider it the most powerful song on the album. Vocally, Haley's at her seductive, femme fatale best. Love the tender, lullaby piano opening as Spiderweb gradually builds to full on rock before ending with the lullaby piano again. Think \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" meets \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". If this song doesn't turn you on you must be dead.<br /><br />What You Don't Know - A sweet song about new love emerging from friendship, this classic 70's disco track pulls you onto the strobe-light dance floor rocking the polyester leisure suit. Dust off the disco ball, and shake your groove thing, baby!<br /><br />Let's Run Away - Haley shows off her Reggae chops, and guess what: She's absolutely awesome!! I love the way her tone meshes with the reggae beat, and the track's fun, loving vibe is infectious. Who knew? Get me a margarita on the beach and let me dance to Haley.<br /><br />Final rating: Haley Reinhart's \\"LISTEN UP!\\" (Deluxe) = 5/5 Starserself anything she needs to in order to stay with Mr. Wrong.<br /><br />Wasted Tears - A catchy Motown track about recovering from heartbreak, this song hearkens back to early Supremes with lots of horns.

B007SGM084|5.0|AS I live in Germany i ordered the first book via Kindle as it was recomended to me by an US friend.At first I found it somewhat odd especially at the some of the descriptions of the SM room and practices.However eventually I found these not so disturbing as the idea of this book was to depict the weird life of a tormented man and his girfriend.As the story went on (book I)  my interest grew and finally ordered the trilogy!it´s not a great literary work but entertaining and depicts all characters very well and the plots get more interesting with each book.<br />All in all I it think good  Summer reading and as a non American I found the \\"F\\" word a bit too much in it but ,how ever those who won´t read this because of the language I can assure them that the\\"F\\" word is about the worst , all other sexual descriptions are in normal vocabular.I have read worse! (Aniis Nin)<br />Of course besides the plot there are always very intersting threads of  love torment and controllig throughout the book which is quite intriguing keeps one reading more.<br /><br />As I´m bit of a romantic I found the end very conforting without wanting to give much away.<br />I would say it is worth buying. It´s different but good.
B007MJSQSK|3.0|This charming film recaptures the spirit of Tintin as I remember him in my childhood days growing up in France (Army Brat). I recommend it for all ages.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game on my Kindle Fire!  Always loads fast- Always a new game- Always fun and entertaining!!  Well worth the price!
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|This movie isnt as bad as some of the reviews say- i found it a bit intriquing actually. Everyone keeps saying how stupid the men were for not fighting better or using better weapons- how could they when they were mentally and physically worn out? I thought their actions were warranted for just have surviving a plane crash. The wolves were pretty awesome and realistic, sure they were a little hyped up, but still entertaining )because this IS only a movie remember). The only down side I saw was the over use of the F word- a bit unnecessary a lot of the times.  And I agree with others, the ending sucked..  Overall- it is not a bad movie, there has been worse.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Addictive... drains battery fairly fast but nonetheless awesome game. I definitely recommend this game for those looking to kill some time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very nice that's all I have to say about this app I wish the review wouldn't have to be so long
B000AV2G3I|2.0|This abomination has been \\"hammered\\" as they say. I thought it sounded odd on first listen, as though they had almost been re-recorded.....it turns out that this was one of the first of a long line of releases to have the files compressed so that the final product is LOUD. Now that the 2009 remasters have been in the stores for about 3 years, you can hear the music the way Lennon produced it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Just as the first three books each continue with the same characters at different times and well written.  You sometimes loose track of the many characters brought up in short depictions of chronology for each separated by many in between before he continues with each character.  However one does want to keep reading.

0345803485|1.0|I am about 2/3 of the way through listening to a recording of this book. I wish I'd read DS from LA's review before buying it; I wouldn't have bothered.  I'm among those who think that just because you're writing erotica, it doesn't give you license to write badly and murder the English language. I just have to add one thing to his list of examples of execrable writing and plotting.  Please, please tell me: Who talks or listens to their own subconscious?  Your SUBconscious is, by definition, SUB (below, beneath) consciousness and therefore it is a part of your personality with which you CANNOT COMMUNICATE!!! Subconscious behavior is not expressed in thoughts and is unknowable and uncontrollable in the moment it manifests itself, although it can be reflected upon at a later time; ask any psychotherapist. Now, all of those innumerable times that Ana bites her lip (that DS apparently nevertheless took the time to enumerate)....THAT'S subconscious.  And Ana certainly never stops to reflect on any of her behavior, subconscious or otherwise.<br /><br />Also, every time Ana plods out her standard reactions of \\"holy crap\\" or the other 1,836 hackneyed expressions she uses, I wonder how this child managed to graduate, supposedly near the top of her class, with a degree in English from Washington State University.  Maybe our educational system is in worse shape than I thought...
B007JRU2UK|2.0|The Descendants.  What does that say to you?  Somehow I missed everything about this movie, trailers and reviews, except for the part of it being shot in Hawaii.  I had no idea what to expect, although someone wrote it was like \\"every other George Clooney movie\\".  I can't say either way, even after seeing it.  To me, the title could be for a Sci-Fi Horror flick, where the Descendants are those of Martians who impregnated women five generations ago, and now, after passing from womb to female child from generation to generation, they're ready to pop out, after devouring the living woman in the most gory fashion, of course, and terrorize the audience for the next ninety minutes, and four sequels.  Or something.<br /><br />This movie is not that movie.  It could probably use a better title.  It opens with a panoramic shot of Diamond Head and Waikiki environs, shot from a tower or hillside house near Punchbowl, or thereabouts.  Then there's a shot of a nice blonde woman in a speeding boat.  One gets the impression this boat ride went bad, but one never sees it.  Instead, George Clooney's voice, sounding bitter, is talking about living in paradise and how everyone seems to think that makes life better.  Instead, he asks (and I paraphrase) \\"does that make our diseases less fatal?  Our families less screwed up?\\".  Yep, the whole film set up right there.  It turns out that the pretty lady in the boat is Clooney's wife, and she fell out of boat and is in a coma.  She's going to die, that's not the focus of the movie, as she left a living will, so we'll move along.  I can't tell you what happens, but I can say the marriage was not going well, George spent too much time in the office;  there are two daughters, one of which looks more Hawaiian than anybody else in the film, which begs the question, who was HER father?  The older daughter has a cave man for a boyfriend, or at least that's what you think until Grandpa, father of the dying woman, punches him.  Yep, you can't tell the kids from the adults these days.  So there are family issues.<br /><br />But, the Family, is also a trust, holding 25000 acres of pristine Kauai ocean front property, and the trust will expire in seven years.  Fear Not.  The movie does not cover even one year.  So, they're meeting to talk about selling the land.  The sale will make them all filthy rich, and some of them need the money.  At this point it's worth pointing out that the trust dates back over 100 years, to A Real Hawaiian Princess (we thought Hollywood was over this enchantment with native princesses, but apparently not).  She was a direct descendant of King Kamehameha, but she married a haole (a white dude, although the word, like Gringo, originally meant stranger, and was first used on the Chinese) and that's how we can have a movie set in Hawaii with almost no Hawaiians in it.  Or Filipinos, Chinese, etc etc.  (For those of you who are pineapple starved:  King Kam unified the islands under his rule in the 18th century.  The caboose end of that dynasty was King Kalakaua, who blew the wad on two world tours and a grand marriage based on that of Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie, who at least had an empire to pay for it).<br /><br />So, once we establish that A) Mom Is Going To DIe.  and that B) We Must Sell The Land (we think).  The only thing left to do is to find out what they do with the land, and how George will react to the news that his nest has been invaded by a real estate geek---I'm sure the actor is a real nice guy, but if you already have George Clooney, would you really be going after a geek?  I suppose so, but I don't like it.<br /><br />The older daughter and her boyfriend are developed nicely.  The little girl remains something of a pet human.  The cousins, aunts and uncles, are nothing but talking background, and Dad In Law is the Character.  George Clooney plays the sort of fatherly role once played by Fred MacMurray and Robert Young (if you don't know who they are, you ARE young, and aren't missing much, but you should ask around from time to time, in case you miss the start of the war) and while he's quite sympathetic and likeable, we never really get to know him.  No one ever seems to realize that it is HIS wife who is comatose, despite their failings.  I think the movie would have been better with a bit more of a focus on him, along with the daughters.<br /><br />In the end, given that the impetus of the film is set by the dying woman, once she's gone and all the questions are answered, about her and the land (it's on his side, not hers) you've pretty much had the experience.  Watch it again?  Maybe.  I'm not so sure.  I give stars as much for watchability in reruns, and three stars is a movie I'd buy, or already own.  I give this a two.  It's a run of the mill dying person story, sharing the plot with a family business drama, and minus the Love quotient that would have made the dying part sufficient to carry the film.  So, while it's worth a first try, I'd put it half way down your list with a view towards a hurricane evacuation;  a very rainy day, or when you're snowed in, next winter.  Set in a nice Sonoma red and some cheese and do it in style.

B007SGM084|1.0|Much too expensive to purchase the digital copy.  Shame on the publishers!  This is one trilogy I will not be buying.  In fact I am only buying one book and sharing with members of my book club.  That's money lost for Amazon and the publishers due to ridiculously high prices!

B007SGM084|5.0|This is a must-read for any female who is open-minded and enjoys her freedom of mind and body.<br />Very erotic and well written.  The fact that this is the most talked about book in the media got my attention.<br />When I heard what the book was about, I became fascinated as to how this would be described.  I was not disappointed.<br />Ms James' characters are well thought out and come alive on each page.  While you'd think the eroticism would become somewhat similar<br />in each act, it's more than surpising to find the creativity that is exressed with each sexual moment.<br /><br />It is really a love story, a story of trust, faith and deep commitment.
B007YJS7G4|5.0|Great Acting. Very Realistic. Great Special Effects. Great Writing. A very important part of American History and the Black contribution to our country brought to life.

0763639184|5.0|My daughter is now 16 mos old and this has been one of her favorite books since she was about 4 mos old. She has always loved the colorful illustrations, and has now progressed to identifying colors and shapes, and counting fish. A great book for infants and toddlers! She even loves \\"reading\\" this one on her own...A great gift for any baby and/or new Mom :)

B004HO6HWA|3.0|Probably will appeal more to some guys than some females with all the violence, explosions, and action.  My husband really liked this movie, I'am sure for the action.  I thought it was okay, because I like a little action in my movies as well.  Jason Statham is not one of my favorite action he-man type guys.  Actually, his acting is quite boring for me.  He's no Bruce Willis, Jet Li, or Sylvester Stallone.  I would like to see a lot more emotions on his emotionless facial expressions.<br /><br />This movies story line fell a little short for me.  Killing Donald Sutherland, and then pretending it was not him by going after the real killers, made no sense to me.  I know he had to do it, but to have him work with the son in finding the real killers baffled me even more.  It was obvious the son was going to find out sooner or later.  Of course, they would surely have a confrontation of some sort. I think the movie would have been more effective if the story line was more interesting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought the first Wool story separately. I'd read some good things about it, but I thought, \\"How good could it be? What if I don't like it?\\" Then I read the story and it haunted me. I kept thinking about it. I won't put any spoiler info in here, but Hugh Howey has created a fascinating world and although Wool #1 is a complete story, it left me wanting to know more. So I bought the Omnibus. I had to know! If you enjoy stories where the truth is revealed ever so slowly... buy it. You won't be sorry you spent all that time with your nose in your Kindle.
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|great live cd as always jim morrison at his best one cannot say enough about the doors this band can keep you rocking
B004HW7JI8|4.0|No matter how much better I liked this season of Pretty Little Liars better than the first season I had to give it 3 1/2 stars. There were both good and bad things about this show. I liked how we found out more shocking secrets and the show is suspensful especially the big secret about Spencers family and who A was and one good twist was there is an A team so theres more people involved in texting the girls nasty messages and that these people might have been involved in the murder of Alison. What was dissapointing was somebody was also killed off \\"supposedly\\" in the show and while it wasn't who I expected to get killed off it was kind of dissapointing. What really annoyed me is that if you're like me and you've read the book series, ABC Family fooled us into thinking that A wasn't who A was in the first 4 books and that got on my nerves because I expected someone different. But all in all this was a great season. However I do have to mention one important thing. Parents I suggest that you don't let younger teenagers or teenagers that are impressionable watch this. Because there is a student teacher reltionship going on with Aria and Mr.Fitz and the show is making it look okay which it shouldn't. And parents might not like some of the unrealistic things the parents of Aria do. One thing is Arias father gets a job for Ezra far away from Rosewood despite wanting to call the police on him. What is he waiting for? And the fact that Arias mother doesn't want to call the police because they don't want the police in their lives again and doesn't want Aria to elope with him but at the same time she doesn't want Aria to be with the teacher. But really theres no other way except to call the police and get the teacher away from Aria. There is also a scene where Aria and Mr. Fitz are having sex but its not explicit and they just show them kissing and about to take their clotes off but the sex scene isn't intense. But talk to your kids and tell them most of the stuff in that show is unrealistic especially the parents not doing much about the student teacher relationship.w is unrealistic especially the parents not doing much about the student teacher relationship.

B005MMYPIE|5.0|Wow what a find this CD is awesome, every track has something catchy about it. From the heavier \\"Leave Everythin Behind\\" to the softer \\"Amaranthine\\" the vocals are incredible. Three vocalists may seem odd as it did to me but the combo of female and male clean vocals with the growling male vocals is just beautifully brought together. I would recomend this CD to fans of Epica, Nightwish, Delain, Lacuna Coil, Evanessence, etc, or to anyone who wants a top of the class album, I can't wait for a second album from Amaranthe.

0985114606|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK!  It is by far the best romance novel I've read.<br /><br />Eva Tramell is starting a new job and has moved back to NYC where her neurotic over protective mother lives.  Eva's past has scarred her but she's determined to put the past behind her and forge a happy live for herself.  Her best friend Cary has moved with her and together they're healing old wounds and trying to avoid self-destructive behavior.<br /><br />Then Eva meets Gideon Cross and it's electric.  It literally knocks her off her feet.  He pursues her in a way that scares her and opens up old fears.  She also craves him like air. He's equally as tormented by his past.  Their relationship is an inferno and Eva hopes it doesn't implode.<br /><br />Let's face it, most romance novel follow the same plot line: young hot girl is somehow damsel in distress and she meets smoking hot, rich, best sex ever, guy who \\"rescues\\" her.  It's all about how the story is told.  And this story is hot hot hot!!!  As a huge YA fan I loved how this book just jumps right into the action without pages and pages of background.  I loved Eva and wanted Gideon in the worst way.  I read it twice in a row because once was just not enough.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey may be the new \\"it\\" book but this book is actually worth reading!!!  I highly recommend it!!!

B000002KO3|3.0|Shortly after completing \\"Remain In Light\\", his attempt to fuse West African beats with Talking Heads music, Eno recorded a real Afro-Beat group called Edikanfo.  Quote from Eno in his biography, On Some Faraway Beach:  \\"The experience (recording Edikanfo) was 'depressing', he later admitted, simply because it made his own African-inspired with Talking Heads seem 'wooden by comparison'.  I wouldn't be surprised if David Byrne felt the same way.<br /><br />That's pretty much what you get with Remain In Light.  It sounds like Brian Eno the band enthusiastically attempting to make their own new wave version of Afro-Beat.<br /><br />The music sounds rushed, not in terms of hurried production, but in terms of the beat. Everything is slightly ahead, making the album FEEL nervous or high strung (or wooden, as Eno called it).  It doesn't really groove.  It sounds metronomic. In a way, that is what makes it distinctive and unusual.  It doesn't sound like anyone else at the time and didn't sound like Fela Kuti.  Listening out of context now, without influence of the press or the 'scene' in 1980, I can understand that it was really unusual then.  David Byrne's voice and phrasing really make it special.<br /><br />Since we live in an age where it's easy to make comparisons, seek out Edikanfo (or look at video clips online) and compare it to Remain In Light.  Robbing something of it's groove is an interesting effect, but is it really better?  Would the album have been better using real African musicians?  Who knows?

B005D0RDIE|3.0|Okay so im checking out this new Rush: Time Machine concert DVD and I have to say a few things. First off, Geddy just doesnt have the voice anymore. He has to strain to hit the high notes that were a constant for him years ago. 2nd, both Alex and Neil are showing their age and their limitations that come with it. Overall, unless they decide to just do instrumentals of all their songs then IMO its time for them to hang it up.
0439023521|4.0|My girls are 11.  They were bored by the first 30 pages and stopped reading it, too much politics of haves and have nots.  I don't think they would have liked later parts of killing and surviving, either.  Some characters are there solely as a murder fodder.  Kids (any) will not understand the senselessness of it.<br />I enjoyed the book.  I read it to figure out the movie, and they will not be seeing the movie in a theater.  But I enjoyed Robinson Crusoe for the list of survival gears, and the same for this book.

0439023521|5.0|I ordered the fist book in the Hunger Games trilogy and fell in love with it.  When I looked to buy the 2nd and 3rd books. I found there was a promotion where I could get the entire collection included in the price for buying a Kindle reading device, which I did.  I haven't finished the third book, but am working on it with every free minute.  I feel there are some political innuendos and a fair warning of what might happen if we don't take care of each other and our planet.  I really like that it was about a central female hero....READ IT!

0345525558|5.0|This Novel hit close to home. Being of mother where 2 of my three sons are adopted and one of them having been in foster care, it was an emotional beginning to this story. My son thankfully was not in foster care as long as Victoria, but there were 11 foster home before age of 5 for him. This ended with his 12th placement with us. He did know his mother but the natural bonding never happened.I understood Victoria's broken down and defensive front. It is survival mode when you have been jerked around all your life and not shown the proper love a child needs.  On the other end of the spectrum my son did eventually attach to people but there were years of psychiatric help.  Victoria was so smart and it angered me, as a former teacher, no one ever seemed to picked up on her emotional needs. I like the little fantasy of how her language of flowers transformed people.  I understood her fear to keep her newborn but who was there to help guide her as a mother. She had no idea of what she was suppose to do except for very basic things.  Thank goodness for Grant and Elizabeth, who despite their own emotional issues could give love.  I also bought the book, A Victorian book of Flowers.

1423140591|5.0|What do you get when you mix Greek Gods with Roman Gods? One big, fantabulous mess of mythological fun! When you pick up the Heroes of Olympus: Son of Neptune, by Rick Riordan, you will expect to hear about the characters from the first book in the series. But Riordan has a plan... a plan that will make you obsess about the next book a whole year! Riordan is a masterful, evil genius who keeps us engrossed and makes us love his characters like they are our own friends and relatives.<br /><br />Juno (Roman Hera) had an interesting plan- put a Roman demigod in the Greek camp (Jason) and a Greek demigod in the Roman camp (Percy). What she did next was mean, but it served its purpose- she wiped their memories. In The Lost Hero, we watched Jason find his purpose. In this book, we see Percy meet up with two Roman demigods, Frank and Hazel, to start their part of the quest to stop Gaia from rising. Gaia, the oldest mother goddess of the earth is one mean cookie who will send everything to stop the demigods from foiling her plan to return- mean cyclops, basilisks, even creepy little grain gods. (Imagine being stalked by the God of Wheat?!)<br /><br />While they know they have a greater purpose, both Hazel, a daughter of Pluto and the underworld, and Frank, a reluctant son of Mars (Ares) still have their own demons to deal with. They embark upon a quest to stop Gaia's first giant son from returning, but they know the Roman camp is still in danger. along their quest, they learn just how dangerous things have gotten out in the mythological and the modern worlds. With monsters and beast roaming around searching for them, they aren't sure they will get their quest finished, let alone get back in time to stop the raid on the camp. But what Gaia and the monsters failed to realize is that Percy and the demigods have friends, lots and lots of friends. Will they defeat the monsters this time? Will it stop Gaia's plot to destroy the Greek and Roman gods forever?<br /><br />I picked up this book expecting to see Jason, Piper, and Leo, and I was surprised (although not unpleasantly) that this book was not about them. With this new trio, I expect the six will come together with another demigod (Annabeth?) to create the seven from the prophecy that save the world from Gaia. The worst thing about these stories is that a year in between each installment is literally painful. They are so tied to one another that it is awful to wait that long to find out what happens next. I have a feeling I know where Riordan is going with this, but you never know! Ole Ricky is a tricky duck!<br /><br />Like the other Riordan books, these are phenomenal for all ages. Perfect for middle readers, funny enough for older readers, even my grandmother loves these books! Everything written by this man should be on the selves of every library and classroom in the country. They are so accessible, exciting, and hilarious, they make the perfect go-to book for any struggling or strong reader. Not to mention, it makes everyone wish they were a demigod. Who would you want to be related to? Neptune? Pluto? Hera? Aphrodite? I simply can't decide!this book expecting to see Jason, Piper, and Leo, and I was surprised (although not unpleasantly) that this book was not about them.

B005LAIGOQ|1.0|worst movie seen in a very long while Daniel made me waste money.  don't be fooled.  total exploitation of his potterness.
B005LAIHQ8|3.0|The MIB have come to be loved by those of us who loved such sci-fi and movies like Ghostbusters etc.. and now the 3rd installment comes along out of nowhere, and after seeing it, I was a little disappointed with it. The general feel of the whole movie didn't feel all that fresh, and it repeated a lot of the same old jokes from the first two. I guess you could argue they are more of a calling card or what not, but I felt like I'd heard them before, especially since now they have been repeated in a re-write 3 times. Will Smith as J didn't seem to be as fun this time around, and K well, he is always the same, except now he has a new guy playing his younger self. As you can tell by the trailer, the plot is about an alien who escapes prison. This alien had his arm shot off by K back in the 60's, so he when he escapes he travels back in time to change history. J wakes up to find K is dead and has been since the 60's. So, without the need of thinking why he even still remembers K, he travels back in time to stop the evil alien from changing history.<br /><br />A few other things bugged me in the movie, not just the repeat of the same old jokes, but the lack of introducing memorable characters. There isn't even the talking pug in this one, just a poster of him and a reference to what he is up to in the 60's... I dunno why they would not bring him back, but continue to include those annoying little worm aliens. It didn't feel like it was a fun joyride with a clever ending this time... in the last two movies, it was like, the action built on top of the action and kept rising to a final climax... but this one, euhh, it just goes and barely picks up any steam.<br /><br />I didn't even really laugh much during the film, and when I did, it was a small chuckle, not a burst out laugh. It feels now like the original MIB made new grounds for comedy and the special effects where exciting, but now, it seems like common place and the original feel of excitement has become formula over everything else.<br />I'm not saying it's a bad movie tho, it does explain a few things you may have wondered and ties in a few things... but still, it does remain to keep alot of questions open, so I expect they will be back for MIB4.

B002M9WW30|2.0|This review will be incomplete as I have only watched the first 3 movies.  I have the Standard DVD collection minus \\"Rocky Balboa' and was happy with it but since Amazon offered it at a very good $19.00 on Blu Ray I thought I would take a chance.  So far, and especially for Rocky and Rocky 11, the video is damn awful and I doubt the transfers were from original masters.  The amount of grain is as obvious as you can get, it is all over each of the films.  For the Rocky 111 film, you can actually see the drop outs from whatever footage they transferred it from.  The DTSHD 5.1 audio is a joke for the first 3 films as well.  While the score is spread to all channels, there is almost no use of the rear channels at all and especially for the fight scenes where the crowds are all over the arena, you would expect to have some audio coming from behind you as much as from in front of you.  I will watch the remaining films and add to this review but I am seriously considering returning the whole thing.<br /><br />On a positive note, the packaging is excellent as each separate disc is on its own individual plastic page and kept separate from touching the other discs.  Removing or replacing a disc is easy and safe for the DVDs.<br /><br />If you already have these movies from the original release, don't bother with the blu ray versions as you really won't see an improvement.  Have now watched Rocky IV and V...they are no better than the others in terms of video and audio quality.  My wife thinks I am crazy to do this Rocky marathon but I had to get through them. I will say that there is some minor improvement in V but that is not due to the video/audio transfer, but to better technology after all those years.<br /><br />Addendum, just noticed that one of the discs is missing, the latest Rocky Balboa.  Called Amazon and they offered to replace it for me but I told them that I would just as soon return the set and have them credit my account which they graciously will do.  Just received a return label to mail it back to them with.  Great service  from Amazon.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksceived a return label to mail it back to them with.

B004SKLD9A|5.0|One of the best movies to add to your collection. It give matrix a run for its money. I real hidden gem.
006197806X|5.0|Good summer read and great condition. If you liked the first book this one is more action packed and has a serious cliff hanger ending.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book reads like an update of the \\"Story of O\\".  Not much new here, but is titillating (no pun intended).
0061726826|4.0|A little slow to start but an interesting concept of love being a disease that is controlled. Good beach read.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I think this is very fun, never freezes, and it makes it challenging and fun! :-)  I think people should get this app.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As one other reviewer commented, I really can't add a whole lot more than what others wrote, but I felt compelled to write my own review.  Its gonna be short and sweet . . . Its been so long since I've read a book that I just couldn't put down.  I have pictures in my head of the characters, and couldn't sleep for casting the movie in my dreams.  This is a such a good book.  Just get it, read it, love it.  Thanks Hugh, I can't wait to read the rest of your works.  I wish you every success!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|To begin, the case holding the collection of movies is very cool. Moreover, the quality of the blu-ray technology is impressive. This makes an excellent gift for anyone who loves Alien.
B006G7YBT2|5.0|This sequel to \\"The Dawn Patrol\\" could be Winslow's best novel yet. It features several intriguing characters, including an ex-cop and surfing nut named Boone. More surfers, cops, and gang thugs make for a lively cast. Winslow is one of the rare crime fiction writers who can both write well and tell a good story. Plus, he has that Elmore Leonard-like ability for penning razor-sharp dialogue. Here's an example from one page in \\"The Gentlemen's Hour\\":<br /><br />Boone goes to Starbucks ... and endures the skepticism that results from his order of \\"a medium black coffee.\\"<br /><br />\\"You want an Americano Grande?\\" the barista asks him.<br /><br />\\"A medium black coffee.\\"<br /><br />\\"Grande.\\"<br /><br />\\"Medium,\\" Boone says, gesturing to the cups. \\"The size between large and small.\\"<br /><br />\\"That's a grande.\\"<br /><br />\\"There we go.\\"<br /><br />\\"Your name?\\" the barista asks.<br /><br />\\"My name?\\"<br /><br />\\"So we can call you.\\"<br /><br />\\"For what?\\"<br /><br />\\"For when your Americano Grande is ready.\\"<br /><br />\\"I thought you'd just pour it.\\"<br /><br />\\"We have to make it,\\" the barista says. \\"Then we'll call you.\\"<br /><br />\\"Boone.\\"<br /><br />\\"Boo?\\"<br /><br />\\"Just use Daniels.\\"<br /><br />\\"Thank you, Daniel.\\"<br /><br />He stands there waiting for his coffee. She looks at him kind of funny, then points to her right and says, \\"It will be over there. They'll call you.\\"<br /><br />\\"Got it.\\"<br /><br />He slides over to his left and waits behind another couple of caffeine communicants who receive their cappuccinos and macchiatos with appropriate reverence, then hears, \\"Daniel.\\"<br /><br />\\"Thanks.\\"<br /><br />\\"You got it.\\"<br /><br />He takes his coffee into the main part of the place and sits down in an over-stuffed easy chair. About the only one there without a laptop computer, he feels like an old man going to the newspaper rack and taking a physical copy of the New York Times, printed on something called paper, and goes back to his chair. People like up, slightly annoyed, when the turns the page and makes a rustling noise.<br />  (end of book excerpt)<br /><br />In my opinion, this is brilliant writing. If you've enjoyed Winslow's other novels, or enjoy writers such as Elmore Leonard, Robert Crais, or John Sandford, don't miss this Winslow novel.ightly annoyed, when the turns the page and makes a rustling noise.<br />  (end of book excerpt)<br /><br />In my opinion, this is brilliant writing.

B0074MZSWW|3.0|It's great that this genre of music is being kept alive by groups like this. This album is a special glimpse of a performance that may be very different from suceeding efforts. The singer has been compared to many  others, and those comparisons are not exactly accurate or fair; they are simply convenient. The overall sound is raw, road-housey, and brash. It may be too raw, too brash and unpolished for some. Yet that is part of its appeal, and perhaps a smoother, more commercial production would blunt the impact and enthusiam of this band.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Great book that combines all of the underworld creatures, witches and humans for an adventure that reads as modern day but has an old time feel!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It's so addictive. Its like your building your own community. It can be for children or adults. My daughter plays on her ipod right next to me.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|A story line that sucked you in.  It was difficult to put the book down.  some portions of the story were a bit mundane and the centarl female character seemed to have real problems sorting out her personal life which was a little iritating.  I found the first book better than the recently released movie.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|SEEMS LIKE WE WAITED FOREVER FOR THIS ALBUM BUT IT WAS SOOO WORTH IT.. ITS SO NICE TO SEE ADAM PUTTING SO MUCH OF HIMSELF INTO THIS ALBUM, HES A GENIUS AND THERES NO ONE OUT THERE LIKE HIM.. GLAMBERT FOR LIFE..
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I have, to this point in my life, successfully avoided reading any Jane Austen books, supposing them to be superfluous and archaic. I really only read this book because I wanted the foundation and familiarity with the story prior to reading the adaptation entitled ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' by Seth Grahame-Smith. Because who can pass up a good zombie book, after all?<br />I started this book begrudgingly but was soon intrigued by the language. I amused myself by reading aloud a paragraph of flowery language to my husband and then paraphrasing it in a sentence. I proclaimed and bemoaned the inefficiency of the writing style but persevered and slogged on. About halfway through the book, I surprised myself by really wanting to know what happened next. And here I sit, 1am in the morning, having to finish the book tonight with the absolute stubbornness of having to know Elizabeth's disposition!<br />Hands down, I loved this book. Shame on me and my ignorance for Ms. Austen's talent. I hope to read many more of her books. After I read the zombie version of 'Pride and Prejudice'. :)
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I am very pleased with the purchase of I look to you by Whitney Houston. I can look at her photo and remember her fondly. I miss her very much and was very saddened at her demise. She had a beautiful voice and was a beautiful person.<br /><br />Sincerely<br />Shirley
1401323820|4.0|I really enjoyed this book -- it was the perfect tie in to the television program. Witty, sarcastic and playful...just like the show. I was pleased to find that I wasn't able to guess the killer, as these types of books tend to be a bit formulaic. It was a short, fun book that was well thought out in regards to it's integration with the actual program. My absolute favorite part of this book was the acknowledgements at the end. It was probably one of the best analogies I've read and conveyed heart felt love and appreciation. Nicely done!
0345803507|4.0|What can I write that hasn't been written before?  Seems so odd to me now that I so tentatively read the first novel, and winced several times, not just at the graphic sex scenes, but at the really weird (to me anyway) \\"submissive\\" roles Ana would take on.  I really felt uncomfortable at her \\"kneeling\\" in the submissive position in the playroom.  Honestly, that disturbed me more than any of the other kinky sex.  But, that being said.... after reading the first 2 books of the trilogy, we all want to know how this will end.  And, I can truthfully say that the 3rd book is not a disappointment in that regard.... the relationship evolves even further and is at times very sweet.  The wedding, the honeymoon, when the \\"honeymoon ends...\\"  Especially knowing, that Ana has given her heart to a very \\"#$%-ed\\" up Mr. Grey & takes a chance.... Remember, it's fiction.... Would anyone else have this much faith?  Don't know.... but that's why we read fiction.... for the \\"What if's\\" in life.<br /><br />It ends as it should.  But, it's still a little \\"choppy\\", just.... maybe a bit too hurried?  I'm not sure.  And I will say, I'm not a fan of the last bit about \\"Christian's point of view\\", going from the beginning of the story.... I liked so much better NOT knowing what he was all about (As the 1st person narrative of Ana) & trying to figure him out, just lent an intriguing mystery about Mr. Grey.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good read & REALLY (?) all those who criticize the writing?  What IS good writing?  I've read Austen, Cervantes, Twain.... all good, but I think they would even agree - if you enjoyed the story & \\"couldn't put the book down\\" - that's good writing - don't over think it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love books that don't have convenient endings and as the culmination of The Hunger Games series, this book definitely did not end conveniently.<br /><br />The themes of fairness and ethics/morality comes to their apex with this book and similar to the Harry Potter series, the farther along in the books you go the higher the stakes become. Because fairness, or more unfairness, is such a large part of the plot, much of this book is frustrating to experience as characters are placed in no win situations. This just reinforces how effective the author is in getting the reader entangled with the fate of these characters.<br /><br />However the most beautiful part of this book comes near the end when all emotion is set free for Katniss, resulting in waves of tears for both Katniss and the reader. The author does such a fantastic job describing ultimate loss and grieving that is so common so to so many.<br /><br />A fitting end to a wonderful series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love it after the first load!  Gives you something to work for while entertaining you.  Fun for adults and children!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loving this series. This book did not go in the direction I expected it to but that was half the enjoyment. I love the themes of fairness (or more commonly unfairness) in the world of Panem and how vulnerable each character is regardless of how brave their exteriors may be. I would love to discuss this book with a young adult reader as I am sure it brings up a multitude of topics that they may not have invested a lot of time in exploring - the fairness/unfairness issue, politics, freedom, our perception of quality of life when compared to others and women as role models....just to mention a few.<br /><br />Speaking of the characters, they are so well fleshed out that I feel like I know them. More importantly I'm invested in them. Some of the twists and turns were a little too twisty and turny for me, but I am interested to see if this is just foreshadowing for the last book in the trilogy. Very enjoyable series so far.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is one of the most difficult and addictive puzzle I played in a long time. No wonder it was invented in Japan!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Fantastic book. Really enjoyed this read with it's strong female protagonist and brave story telling. I can see now why fans of the book are so rabid. The themes of death, unfairness, and survival are dark, frustrating, and uplifting.<br /><br />Reading a review of the movie adaptation spoiled the fate of one of the characters for me however, I was surprised to find myself in tears when I arrived at that point in the novel. Relentless and engaging, I can't wait to follow these characters (what's left of them) into the following two books.
B000063UR1|5.0|I remember watching this on t.v. as a kid in the mid-70's.  I loved it then and I still do.<br /><br />It has been reviewed here already probably better than I could do - I'm not really a writer.  This film points out the urgency of preserving and maintaining our environment (remember people, this is where we live!!).<br /><br />Forget awesome special effects - this was back in the days when filmakers had to create without the aid of CGI (although the scenes where they are skipping on the outer rings of Saturn are good).  Any truly good sci-fi film is about people and the human condition - when mankind clashes with technology or some unknown from another world - how does it affect humans and how do we react.<br /><br />Think about all the truly good sci-fi films you have seen over the years and you'll agree with me.<br /><br />The film came out around the time 'Earth Day' was instituted - the music reflects this as does the 'Pledge To The Environment' Bruce Dern reads on the wall during the film.<br /><br />It is still one of my favorites - and I have a decent collection of sci-fi movies.<br /><br />If you are a sci-fi lover as I am and you have not seen this film, you will not be dissapointed.  The 2002 dvd release has a nice-looking transfer, plus lots of good extra features - the vintage 'Making of Silent Running' runs about an hour and is awesome.
031606792X|2.0|After plowing through the first three books without feeling much connection to the characters, this book actually gave me a couple of laugh out loud moments and a few plot line twists that I hadn't expected.<br />However, this book felt like it really should have been separated into at least two books. I found it a little disjointed to read from the perspective of Jacob after spending so much time experiencing things from Bella's point of view and the shifts in storylines seems a bit forced with a desperate need to explain all the loose ends.<br />I think it may have been a bit more impactful if there had been more loss on the good side but then again that may be my love for Joss Whedon's penchant for peril.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|This is a really great album. I got the vinyl version and it sounds great.<br /><br />Saw them recently and I think while this album is killer several songs are even better now, that the band has been playing together longer.<br /><br />This record rocks without ever being loud.  It goes from a whisper to some wicked intensity, sometimes a number of times in the same song.<br /><br />I think Tedeschi and Trucks are going to go down as one of the great duos in music and this band will be remembered as one of the great 21'st Century bands.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I was considering to buy between this and FX series and I'm happy that I choose this one. It's faster than FX and it's the same price. The stock fan and is kinda loud at 55 degrees but I managed to lower the rpm speed using speedfan software. Now My set including this great processor, Asus radeon 6850, and OCZ 600 W modstream is quiet as whisper :) I didn't want to use desktop case/chasis so I put all the parts into one of my shelf cabinet. /see pics/

B006UAWH2S|4.0|I was highly anticipating this film after seeing a trailer before another independent style movie I watched. Over-all I was very intrigued by this film and I do plan on watching it again, however there was a little something missing. I think that one little thing was the sense of urgency and realism. The story is being told to us, there is narration throughout the film which I feel greatly takes away the connection with the story, characters, and any sort of relation to the actions taking place. The narration takes away the horror.<br /><br />The AQ and PQ are both great and have a very clean-cut style of cinematography.<br /><br />I love the cast and everyone was brilliant in their portrayal of normal people going through a horrible transformation due to a spreading contagion. At it's heart, Perfect Sense is a love story, however it is semi-predictable and at times frustrating to watch. I do love the end, even through I \\"saw\\" it coming. I feel the movie trailer may have given too much away, it should have been advertised as a love story and nothing else should have been given away.<br /><br />I do highly recommend this movie to fans of the cast and of the indie style epidemic film genre.

B007Z9RAX4|3.0|I had all my friends over one night to watch this movie and we all were very disappointed. Even with the perfect cast, it lacked the intensity and realism that I was expecting. I do understand this is not anything like a Bourne movie and I was not expecting anything like that, however I was still disappointed by the plot and simple dialogue.<br /><br />The PQ was very bland as well as the AQ. Over-all the presentation was dull and lifeless.<br /><br />We did watch the movie throughout, however it is not one that I ever plan on watching again. It was all over the place and difficult to watch.<br /><br />Not recommended to buy, maybe a rent on a boring evening.

B000FC10MU|3.0|This was the first book I've read from this author. It was an ok story. I was hoping for a bit more out of it. I thought it was going to be more philosophical and more history with the gods. I thought Shadow was a likeable character but I thought he was poorly written. The story was a bit longer than what it needed to be. I found that there were stretches of the book that I couldn't put down, but there were stretches that I had to force myself to continue on. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying this book - this is a highly recommended book. Maybe you will find that spark that many people loved that I missed.

0345803485|4.0|Before buying or reading any of the books in the E.L. James trilogy I read hundreds of reviews.  Many of them were just downright funny.  I am a 40+ year old professional woman with multiple advanced degrees.  I am well read.<br />I really enjoyed all three of the books.  I was looking for something enjoyable and entertaining.  That is what I got!  They do hold your interest, you do want to know about the characters and yes, they do have their erotic moments.<br />I find it hilarious that some of the reviews were so devasted, angry, sensitive and well, mean!  But when women get their \\"hate on\\" for another successful woman (like E.L. James) there is no stopping them!  Honestly, I didn't go into reading these books expecting fine literary prose worthy of a Pulizer.  I read them to be entertained and intrigued.  And no, I don't care, frankly that there are other starving talented writers out there that are not getting published. Please!  Lighten up, jealous angry women who write reviews on Amazon.  Congratulations Ms. James, you have written and published books that millions have enjoyed.<br />Thanks.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The book was entertaining  , , easy read , I loved  the music choices- I actually<br />Went and listen to it after I finish the book.

B0035V35PI|5.0|Stylish action flick that looks fantastic on blu ray.  Very good movie.  Someone gave this to me as an xmas gift and I must have watched it 6 times since then.  Great flick
B0060AY85C|4.0|There is no doubt that Toni Morrison is a fine writer.  She has a way with words and every sentence rings with its own kind of beautify.  This novel is short, a mere 147 pages on my kindle and I read it quickly, falling into the sad and tortured world she created.<br /><br />The book is sent in the 1950s, as a shell-shocked Korean veteran escapes from a mental hospital.  He has survived the bitter cold of a Korean winter, he has seen his best friends die  horrible deaths and he has watched a starving child being murdered.  Eventually, he makes his way back to his Southern roots, looking for his sister, the only person he has ever loved.  She is near death because the doctor she worked for had subjected her to horrific gynecological experiments.<br /><br />This is a disturbing book to read and is extremely sad.  And even though the conclusion is satisfactory, I felt disturbed and haunted by it when I finished.  That is the only reason I am stopping short of giving it my highest recombination.
0439023491|5.0|I loved this one out of the three. I was excited to pick up the third one after because it was so great.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I can find no real fault with this season one blu-ray set but (there's always a but) I wonder if I really needed it. I have a very good imagination and enjoyed reading the Game of Thrones books immensely so I'm not sure I needed this visual enhancement so much. The actors, director, sets, etc. are all A+ however so I don't regret seeing the series. There are minor flaws of course but I would just be nitpicking to mention them so I won't. It is a little expensive for just one season but I'm sure was very costly to produce. Others mention the sex and nudity but I don't think it's as graphic as the books describe, at least so far. This entire series is adult fantasy not really for younger readers and viewers, so be aware parents and guardians of our morality.
0345803485|4.0|I loved this book! I thought that it would be a little too much but the plot was so interesting and the fact that you are trying to find out about the character Christian Grey that you can't help but to keep reading. I finished the whole series in 5 days!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this I a good game fore a 10year old I just got my Kendall and that was my first game

B005LLSZNM|5.0|You know how I Know this show is awesome? My fiancee hates fiction. She's just not that in to it. She falls asleep during most movies, but she loved this show. Hell, she's even one of those anti-violence hippy types who get's upset whenever someone gets shot, but she was the one demanding one more episode before falling asleep. That must count for something.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I am so glad I downloaded this app. I love puzzles and quickly became addicted to these. Thanks to the developers.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I personally loved Men in Black 3. It was the first one in the entire series that I could relax and just enjoy watching. If you have to see one movie this holiday weekend then see Marvel's The Avengers, If you are going to see two of them then see Men In Black III. It is the best in the series and a solid B+!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Perfect for small gigs, one-person recording to multitracks, podcasting, practicing, studio experiments, you name it. Nice, quiet, transparent preamps give you plenty of gain for any type of mics, including phantom power for condenser mics. Lots of flexibility in a small package. Includes AC adaptor, but be careful with the plug, those pins look fragile and easily broken if you're heavy handed.
B004J1DBJI|2.0|Even with the get started examples, getting a &rdquo; sorry forced close&rdquo; message about half the time. When it works, the results are great. No help option offered in menus.
0060558121|3.0|Expecting awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping insights and revelations - not this time. Story was somewhat bleak, it could have taken place in a padded room. Perhaps, some lunatic having an identity crisis and possessing limited imagination. All that I got out of this was that people's priorities change from generation to generation. For me, it also didn't make sense to ascribe deities to things people find common to their surroundings. Does the mechanical pencil god really have to take it out on the wooden pencil god?!
B004EPZ034|5.0|This movie is entertaining for both adults and children.  My daughters are 3 and 10 and both liked this show.  My husband even sat down to watch it and enjoyed.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants a fun, family movie.

B005LAIGN2|2.0|1.  I think a lot of folks confuse reviewing a movie vs reviewing the subject matter of the movie.  The story of the Tuskegee Airmen is / should be an inspiration to all; a no brainer.<br />2.  But this movie about the Tuskegee Airmen is a half-baked affair.  Unlike a lot of those who liked the CGI, I was kind of put off by it because it appeared so... CGI.  As soon as I saw the initial battle scenes, it was obvious that it was created via CGI;  it reminded me of the history channel Dog Fights.  Technically, looks great, but at the same time it looks artificial.<br />3.  As with the other folks who gave this movie a somewhat negative review, I 100% agree that the weakest link in this movie is the writing & acting.  And when you get down to it, no matter how great the special effects etc... the fundamentals of a great movie are always going to be solid writing and acting; this movie has neither.<br />4.  An alternative to this movie is the older DVD: The Tuskegee Airmen.  It's not as high tech as this movie, but the fundamentals were there.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|I bought this album on cd when it was released in 2007, at the time a casual fan tryin to get familiar w her music before her concert! Fallin in love w Stevies music n her FWM songs i recently bought all 4 of her solo albums on vinyl then came across a copy of this set on vinyl and i must say the vinyl is amaazin! the package is very sturdy cardboard, gatefold 2lps pressed on 180 gram its such a beautiful collection and any fan should really buy this on vinyl youll love iit even more than the cd-
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is perfect for the Kindle Fire.  It covers the Fire without any extra bulk or extra material.  The Fire fits perfectly in the case.  The elastic works great for keeping it closed or for keeping the flap from moving when open.  The stand works for easy viewing.  I like what the MicroShell cover feels like to the touch--soft, not hard and shiney.  To me this is the perfect case since it is is everything I could want:  light weight, no extra bulk, serves as both case and stand.  I highly recommend this cover for the Fire.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I would reccomend this book to anyone that is a greek mythology fan. I love this book the best because it is the beginning of every thing. Percy is a very enjoyable character, although I would reccommend the read for atleast 12 and up only because some of it is a little &#34;scary&#34; For littler kids. My 10 year old read this 3 months ago and is still scared of it. But I loved it! So 12 and up unless you want your little one to pee there pants.But wonderfully written nothing inappropriate that I sensed.

B00555X8OA|5.0|This book reshaped my view of the world.  It is amazing human beings do as well as they do with so many decisions in life that can be out of touch with reality and experts are far from immune.
0439023521|5.0|It was a really great book, it had a combination of everything, action, romance, and suspense. The story was well developed and had an excellent plot.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Many people undoubtedly asked themselves the same question I did when they<br />heard of this movie. Can Daniel Radcliffe break from the Harry Potter character<br />he has portrayed for so long? Ladies and Gentleman after viewing the Woman in<br />Black I can safely say............Yes.<br /><br />The effects in this movie are simple and practical; there wasn't much, if<br /> any, CG that I could see and I am very open to that. The effects work and they<br /> do their job in combination with the atmosphere of the movie to scare the<br /> freaking pants of you. The movie does not go for jump scares, also known as the<br /> \\"OMG CAT\\" scares, or if you are me, jump startles, but instead slowly<br /> builds it up and relying heavily on the atmosphere to scare you when the ghost<br /> does show its face. Part of the beauty is you never know for sure when the<br /> scares are coming.<br /><br />I seriously cannot think of a single complaint I have with this movie.<br /> People looking for a high body count and gore for the sake of gore, you know<br /> like Saw, will not find it here. the movie relies on suspense to create fear in<br /> his audience. It scares you and creates a knot in your stomach that doesn't<br /> have to do with making you sick or disturbed from the amount of blood on<br /> screen. This is a different kind of horror movie, and it is one I hope to see<br /> more of because this genre hasn't seen a horror movie like this in a while.<br /><br />for my full review of this movie please visit Macabremark.com
0345803493|2.0|I am halfway through the 2nd one and dare I say it...I'M BORED!! I am absolutely confused with their popularity!! We all know its fan-fiction, so it's a thinly veiled version of the Twilight series but this version SUCKS!! I have even caught myself skipping over the \\"mommy porn\\" sex parts because they are so predictable. I never thought I would ever say this but Ana gets on my nerves more than Bella. I almost don't want to read the 3rd book but I am so damn OCD it will just kill me to not finish what I started. I sit here reading it hoping Jacob and his pack show up and kill the whole lot...well maybe not Taylor, I like Taylor.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is hard but fun. also it take a long time go complete all the game.get this game in my opinion
0345803485|1.0|Clearly people are sex-starved. Otherwise, there's no reason to read this book.  It's RIDICULOUS.  Anyone could write this.<br /><br />At the same time - I'm still reading it, and will finish it.  So...yep, I'm right there with everyone else.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I just finished this book a couple days ago. The book was super informative and easy to understand. By the time I finished the book I had a much better understanding of how the body works and what it takes to succeed. There were Some questions I did have after reading the book and didn't know who to ask. At the very end of the book the author gives his email address. I thought it would be a waste of time to email him but I did so anyway. Much to my surprise I just received an email back! I figured it would be some kind of spam, or the author telling me to buy his other books for answers. It was actually Michael responding asking more questions so he could put me on the right track! I am amazed! He is truly out to help you! I would recommend this book to anyone!
B006VP1OYO|4.0|Aikidoka123 is right. This is classic music, and it's a great way to collect all of these EP's at once. But the remastering is nothing special. In fact, it might be slightly worse (these versions sound louder, which is good, but they also sound a little harsh to me) than the old versions from the 80s and 90s. The remastering isn't horrible though (for truly botched remastering, see the 2003 Cocteau Twins reissues), so I would encourage folks to pick this up. The styles here are even more varied than what you find on Isn't Anything and Loveless, while the highlights are just as good as (or better than) anything from those LPs. You also get the previously unreleased and rare tracks which are all at least interesting. And then there's Sugar, one of their great lost tracks. I can see why it wasn't on any of the official EPs or albums. It really wouldn't sound right on any of them. But it's so cool! The crazy production (helicopter-blade percussion, wind-chimes from hell) seems annoying and out of place at first, but it really grows on you. And the tune itself is disarming and hyper-catchy.
0385336942|4.0|I take issue with the dominant-culture Euro-head description of The Cloud Atlas being part \\"fantasy.\\" To any traditional indigenous person, what goes on in The Cloud Atlas vis a vis the \\"shamans\\" is simply and naturally what IS.<br /><br />But about the book itself: Characters are mostly drawn in living color, and what a way to discover an oddity of WWII that was covered up with the cooperation of the media for the war's duration. Right there you have a topic for an entire class period or book-group session.<br /><br />There are action scenes, mostly fights, a bit awkwardly rendered, and a sprinkling of high-pitched melodrama inside the love story.<br /><br />But primarily The Cloud Atlas concerns the collision of not two, but several worlds on a war front we scarcely consider when that conflict comes to mind.<br /><br />Strands diverge and come together and the ending is perfect-pitch.<br /><br />But for pity's sake, Amazon, have your reviewers learn something about the culture they're writing about. In fact anyone who really reads this novel should get, by implication, that no character considers any of the spirit-action \\"fantastic\\".
B006RUJST6|5.0|There are so many reviews on this book already, but I just had to put in my 2 cents worth! This book was a beautiful surprise. I found it to be very well written and the characters extremely likable.<br /><br />The idea of this story is unique and the emotional pull that I felt while reading it was so strong that I read much of it with tears in my eyes - sometimes from laughing and sometimes from crying. It is very rare for me to be so heavily emotionally invested in a book and to me this is the sign of a great story.<br /><br />Thanks Colleen. I can't wait to get started on Point of Retreat!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is AMAZING. it works.  and it does nothing bad to my fire I LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!!!!! and i have over 135 songs and has not slowed down my kindel fire. all i can say is that this app is BEAST!!!!!!!!!
B006PTL1QM|3.0|Period drama about early 1900s in Switzerland and Austria.  Freud is at the peak of his fame, practicing in Vienna.  His young follower Carl Jung works in psychiatric hospital in Switzerland and Freud considers him a golden boy and potential successor in a brand new way of psychoanalysis.  One day, Jung admits new patient, who is very receptive, very intelligent and yes, very neurotic.  In the course of him treating her, Jung falls for her.<br /><br />Cast of actors provides background in what is was to live in early 1900s just before the WWI.  There is also an aspect of class difference between Freud and Jung.  Freud is a self made man, pioneer of he new way of treating patients; he is pragmatic and intellectually sharp but also unforgiving.  Jung on the other hand is married to a wealthy woman and treats his practice as a hobby that over time becomes mix of scientific research and mysticism. Such apprach unlimately causes Freud and Jung ot part their ways on both personal and professional level.  Heavy in dialogue between all three characters, movie explores the relationship between all three of them, the infatuation Jung has for his young patient Sabina who herself trains to become a doctor and his intimate relationship with her in which by the end of affair there is a complete role reversal between the two.  Jung looses control of his emotions, purpose and life that plunges him into a nervous breakdown, while Sabina earns her medical degree, marries and moved to Russia where with her husband she trains young doctors interested in pursuing their career in psychotherapy.<br /><br />One must have undivided attention while watching this movie.  Every part of the dialog is important.  I loved dresses actresses wore in this movie.  Scenes of the gardens and glimpse of old fashioned european buildings are compelling.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|This coulda been a really cool movie had they changed a few things slightly. The best parts of the movie were when he was being a bad ass. There weren't nearly enough of those scenes. Still a good watch though.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I have just finished this book series, as I was curious because of all the hype.  What a waste of time.  It is a  \\"bodice ripper\\" for the 21st century.  Wealthy dissolute rake seduces virtuous young maiden, but is redeemed by her love.  That is it in a nutshell, but with a whole lot of sex and bondage to spice it up.  Frankly the sex just got boring, after the first couple of scenes.  I just skipped through the sex scenes after a while.  Made reading the book a whole lot quicker. Really and truly could anyone have that much sex?  I am surprised the heroine didn't have a chronic urinary tract infection.  The standard of the writing was just appalling. And don't get me started on the product placement.  The author must have shares in Blackberry and Audi. I kept reading, because I kept thinking that it had to get better.  But it didn't.  Don't make my mistake.  Save your money and read Jane Eyre.
B006R1T40I|4.0|I'm a fan.  I don't think I'm capable of giving her less than a 4 of 5.  That said, the album has some tunes that are fresh and others that came from a previous part of her life. And with that said, there were no songs on this album that I'd leave off it.  Nice to have you back, Ms Raitt.  See you at the Flynn in Burlington, VT.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|This is a fast reading book that keeps you on your toes - you won't want to put it down until you are done reading it.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|the game is very fun and is great but you have to spend money on the gold coins.  other than that the game is very fun. GO BWAAAH
0812550706|5.0|Great book and a must read for any teenage boy into sci-fi. With the movie coming out next year I had to read it again.
B003L20IFQ|2.0|The only reason this didn't get one star is that it has some appealing qualities considering it's a movie that takes place inside a box. But it's still stupid. Too man little annoyances. I'd rather be buried alive than watch this again.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love logic puzzles and this one is great. Very well done graphics: simple but elegant. It will take a while to get through all the puzzles, so it is worth it.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This is the kind of book that makes a rainy day special. The author had me shocked and entranced at the same time. Loved it!
B007SGM084|5.0|I am so happy that I purchased 50 Shades of Grey trilogy.  It is a most intriquing  book and I am finding it hard to put down at times.  I try to read during the day around lunch time so I have a few moments of quiet to reflect on the book and the characters.  I definitely would tell others about this book and Amazon.com and the ease of purchase when new books are out.  Thanks for making it easy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like the fact that the Bible can be read to me while I'm getting ready for work in the morning,  there are s lot of features to this book that I have not accessed as of yet. The word of God is always a treasure to me.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|The story is a little unclear about certan things and kind og gets jumbled around in your head.It feels powerful and still dark.At the time I was looking for a more peppy book, like the first two books in this series.Oh well it was still pretty good!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It's going to be hard to wait for this one to be released on blu-ray. Loki is an awesome villain, and thanks to Joss Whedon, has one of the most wicked villain monologues to the Black Widow I've heard in a while. It's clear Hiddleston was a great choice. Every single one of the heroes is interesting and developed. Even Agent Phil (a previously likable, but still rather non-descript character) took a big part. Despite all of these major characters, it not only works, it's an incredible movie. Loved this movie. Thanks, Joss.
0545265355|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, and I think she is on the last book, now she is loaning the books to friends.  She loves them.
1469984202|5.0|I have been an avid reader since I was 9....Trust me: This writer is sharp!  This will make a great movie....and book #6 is jaw dropping as well. I put this fellow up with Justin Cronin of The Passage as one of the best pieces of fiction I have read in years. Brilliant!!!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Fun and challenging game that will give you plenty of time for fun.  A great game for passing the time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a great game for long trips and rainy days.  It has lots of variety and many different mini gamed.  overall it is a fun game and worth it.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|That's the question...I'm still trying to figure that out. In twilight the vampires have the foggy,mysterious apperence.But in Shiver the werewolves do.I would have to say thr story fell heavy and rich like Twilight, but not as dense.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really enjoy this calculator. It has replaced my former favorite. I like the large buttons. They make it so easy to use!
B005LAIGLO|1.0|I don't understand how anyone can say this movie was good. I rented it and finally turned it off without completing it. The acting was poor. A friend told me it was non-stop action. He must not watch many movies. The action never really started. It is just a poor movie. It also has children experiencing violence which sure seems like really lame filler for a dragging plot. It is not even worth a rental.
B006588YUE|4.0|I don't have air conditioning in the summer, and I don't like the idea of water cooling, so I was concerned that I may be building a noisy air-cooled monster. I was resigned to live with a bit of noise, since I had another dead silent system which would be powered up most of the time.<br /><br />I figured that I would order the Intel stock air cooled thermal solution, BXRTSLGA2011AC, until I could find something better suited to my needs. Yes, I was aware that almost everyone criticises the stock Intel HSF. But for $19.99, I wasn't gonna keep about a grand worth of parts laying on the table waiting for assembly.<br /><br />When I got the Intel HSF, initial inspection left me with the feeling that this would be a VERY TEMPORARY stop gap solution.<br /><br />The Heatsink was of modest size, and the fan blew down upon it, Which I liked, but it was almost entirely constructed of aluminum. Only a thin sliver of copper was used on the bottom to make contact with the processor's heat spreader.<br /><br />What was even more shocking, and disappointing was that the heatsink's contact area was round, and only covered approximately 60 percent of the processor's heat spreader!<br /><br />I THOUGHT NO WAY WAS THIS THING GONNA DISSIPATE 130 WATTS OF GENERATED HEAT!<br /><br />The heatsink came with a thin layer of thermal paste pre-applied. With thirty years of dealing with computers, one realizes that manufacturers prepare their products for distribution assuming the worst situations in the field. They are much more concerned that something will at least work out of the box, rather than work well. Thus one finds heatsinks with too much thermal paste. This will assure the vendor that at least \\"some\\" sort of contact will be made, but not necessarily the best contact.<br /><br />I removed about 80 percent of the thermal compound that was pre-applied. I spread the remaining 20 percent into the thinest layer posssible on the heatsink contact area.<br /><br />Mounting the HSF went fairly well. I prefer the new spring loaded screws to the older push-pins and fancy latch contraptions. The screws had to be pushed down quite a way before they would catch. Attention also had to be paid to the order of tightening the screws.<br /><br />Intial power-up gave me one of the most pleasant surprises I have had in a long time.  The system was very quiet, almost silent. In fact, so quiet that if I wanted to tune for noise, I could probably make it silent.<br /><br />The temps were so low that I figured maybe I wasn't pushing it hard enough.<br /><br />The Heatsink was to cool an Intel XEON E5-1620,  very similar to i7-3820<br />So I ran 8 threads of Prime95 @ 3.6GHz<br />With an open case, and room temps of about 72F, the CPU never rose above 122F and the fan hovered around 1900 RPM!<br /><br />Bottom Line: If one knows how to apply it correctly, this Heatsink will cool a 130 watt TDP processor, running 8 threads, full tilt, very quietly. (Not quite silent at 1900 RPM but still very quiet).  Also, this is half the weight and size of full tower Heat sinks which can cause your board to flex and short out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty hard to get coins in the game but that's probably the thing that makes me play. so ya its pretty hard to play

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I have to say that Adam Lambert is truly the most gifted singer that I've ever heard in my life!!!  My ears are in shock and awe.  He is also an amazing entertainer and fantastic songwriter! I'm so happy that he was Executive Producer on this album! He did not disappoint! He truly has a gift for music and the arts!  What is crazy is that this album from top to bottom is creatively out of this world amazing, but what is more amazing is that his live performances are even better! Whaaaat?  Who can do that?  Adam Lambert, that's who! I'm giving him a \\"PERFECT\\" review because the album is just that. As I'm writing this review, I have the album in my home DVD player, and the volume is turned up so high that my house is shaking right now, including my booty! Then, he makes me cry with his amazing, soulful and vulnerable vocals in \\"Underneath\\" and \\"Nirvava\\". Buy the album & make sure you get the experience of seeing him live, as well. His voice and artistry will linger in your mind forever.  I love Adam as a person and an artist...best man in the game! So happy for his success...he deserves this! Way to go Adam!!!! :)

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Once I got through the initial shock of the first book I found the story line.  I am now on book three and am thoroughly enjoying it.  It is definitsly not a bookmfor everyone.
B008578H9G|5.0|I must say, the resolution to this is well-thought out, fairly surprising, and bides well with every character's own personalities.<br />The series ends in the best way possible, but watch the episode and find out.<br /><br />Ah that bittersweet moment when the House series is over... all good things must come to an end, but I'm going to miss this show.
B00543RC0Y|5.0|When the US version of the Harry Potter 1-8 films came out it was priced at $100.<br />I noticed that the UK version on amazon.co.uk was priced at 40 pounds, which translated to $84 which is a lot better than $100!<br /><br />This itself is the UK version of the films, but it's region-free, which means the disc play in any region, whether your from the UK, USA, Australia, etc.<br /><br />I really love this box set, it has 4 DVD covers, with two movies in each case.<br /><br />Really nicely packaged and a great deal!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|A blast, but tough. If you don't like using your brain, skip this app. I love problem solving and this pushes me...thanks. Works great with galaxy, only problem I have is the squares are small, but you can zoom so no worries
0345803485|1.0|I vomited nearly 6 times reading just the first 50 pages of this garbage heap called a novel. Lost 7 pounds but gained it back while gorging myself on M&Ms. A must read for the womb-laden sect of our society but anyone with a half a brain, will never read again after this one. Stick to the Housewives of OC for intellectual entertainment, ladies. Save a tree.
0061726834|5.0|I honestly don't know how I'd live in a world without love. I suppose if I was born into it and it was bred into my bones that love is a bad disease that would eventually kill me, I might I have different opinion. Lena is definitely all for the cure for amor deliria nervosa. When she was younger, her mother was unable to be cured (she had the procedure three times, but it never \\"worked\\") and she ended up walking off a cliff. I can definitely sympathize with Lena: I wouldn't want to fall in love or feel love at all if it was so bad that it caused my mom to commit suicide.<br /><br />In the days before her 18th birthday, her cure date, Lena must complete the evaluations in which she must stand before a panel of four lab scientists and answer a series of questions. This is so that she can be paired with her future husband, but I think it is also a prescreening to ensure that she has not contracted the disease. Her evaluations don't go very well, but there is an \\"incident\\" at the labs the same day, and she is lucky enough to get a do-over. She's also lucky because this is the day she meets Alex, who ends up turning her life upside down.<br /><br />Her best friend Hana is more outgoing and introduces Lena to new parts of her world that are \\"forbidden\\": she listens to illegal music, she sneaks out after curfew, and spends time with boys (breaking the segregation rule). Somehow, Lena ends up being sucked into this world and she and Alex become friends. Since he is \\"cured\\" (she can tell by the mark that all cureds have), she feels that this is ok.<br /><br />Aside from the more indepth synopsis of the book I've just given, I'm not really sure what to say. I know what I WANT to say, but it is totally spoilerific and not fair to you who haven't read it. I will say that I didn't know what to expect from this book. I haven't read Lauren's debut, Before I Fall, and I can't recall reading any dystopian novels before, so I was going in blind. I am no longer blind, my friends! The romance in this story is beautiful because Lena is just discovering it for the first time. Along with that is her fear of love and fear of her society. She gets really tangled up and doesn't know where she belongs because Alex is opening her eyes to things she has never seen before, things that the government hides from people to \\"keep them safe.\\" I could feel all of Lena's emotions throughout the novel, from pain to curiosity to fear to love to confusion and more. It was all very powerful, which indicates to me that the writing is fantastic.<br /><br />The last thing I will say is about the ending, and I will try my hardest not to spoil anything. The ending was absolutely amazing and shocking. I didn't know if I should cry or not, scream or not, be happy or not! There are upsides and downsides to the way it ends, and I think I understand why the characters made the choices they did. It's still really hard to read, emotionally. I had to reread the last two pages at least five times and still didn't believe it. If you're one of those people who reads the last few pages of a story before reading the story itself, I'd recommend for you not to. I'd say don't ever, for any book you ever read, but especially for this one, just DON'T. Just read it. Read it and enjoy it, because you and I both know you will.<br /><br />Thanks to NetGalley and HarperTeen for the eARC!romance in this story is beautiful because Lena is just discovering it for the first time.

B007MJ9LA2|1.0|I used to see Santana live at the Fillmore East in NY many years ago.  He was a truly fantastic player.  He always played from the heart with intense emotion.  In fact, he was personally promoted by the late, great Bill Graham.  Bill Graham had an ear for exceptional talent.<br /><br />Shape Shifter is a waste of your time and of your money.  I have always given Carlos Santana the benefit of the doubt, but he has been on a slippery slope for a while now.  To call this work \\"Elevator Music\\" is an insult to elevators.<br /><br />Very disappointing.  I had always hoped and expected that Santana's next album, would be the one, but this one is not it.<br /><br />I'll just have to content myself and listen to Abraxas instead of this trash.  After one listen, Shape Shifter is already in my trash can.
0446572993|3.0|My opinion of David Baldacci novels varies. I found the Camel Club stories terrible and was glad when they ended. Mr. Baldacci can write, he just doesn't do it as well from book to book. The Innocent started out well-enough, but the introduction of the 14 year old was a big warning sign. A killer and a kid? That is not going to go well. And Baldacci did try to make her precocious enough to keep the irritant level down. But women in this story were hard to figure. Agent Vance got the short end of the stick, in my opinion. It's almost as if she was just there to be used. Any romantic interest that Robie had was for his curious neighbor, a pretty White House worker living in his building and becoming a romantic interest. Surely there is no story there, she's just a character introduced for a little sex appeal. But Baldacci apparently decided he had to up the ante, and big time assassination came into play. I didn't think it was the strong point of the novel, which made the book lose two stars. Well, one half was lost when the 14 year old entered the scene. But, I did read it all with moderate interest, and no one paid me to do so.
B00656C6KK|5.0|I was transported in time.  What a wonderful day I had listening to Doris Day's beautiful voice.  These are songs she recorded in the mid-1980's, and were those she selected for this release.  I had no expectations of the one her son sang, but I was enchanted with it.  All of the songs were hauntingly beautiful, and such a pleasure.  I hit the replay several times.  And, what a reflection upon the lack of beauty in today's music with which we are presented.  There is, unquestionably, a great deal of talent today, but they do not combine their talent with thoughtful poetry, love, and clean/pure expression.  The emotion of today's music seems mostly to be anger, given to much profanity or sex.  They do not exhibit one/hundredth of the poetry, intellect, nor emotion of Doris Day's.  We can only hope some of them will listen, and learn what music should be.

0062213423|5.0|Real stories from the guys themselves. Awesome!!!! I loved every word of it. I could read it a million-billion times.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Really people??  I enjoyed the one who wrote that she threw up after reading the first 50 pages.  Obviously, some of these reviewers need to just stick to teen romance books as they can't seem to handle the adult books.  I have to admit I got caught up on these reviews and wasn't too sure if I could handle the strong content.  After I purchased and read this book, I'm like \\"Strong content...where??\\" I'm still waiting for the blood, the gore, the black eye, the broken limbs, the intensive care scene that everyone seems to think this book has from their reaction.  All I can say is that I do enjoy this series so far and everyone else can just donate their books to an adult woman and continue keeping their chastity belt locked tight with super glue. Too funny people, but keep up with the bad reviews, I'm thoroughly enjoying reading how uptight and over the top some people are.
B0042816YK|1.0|I haven't walked out of many movies in my life, but this was one of them...  Dreary, meandering, pointless and even more self-indulgent than the book, this film was truly awful.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Would like some enhancements to UI, such as dragging to fill and orientation lock but otherwise a great time waster
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I originally considered the leather cover for my KF that is around $40. I found this one and decided to give it a try, as the price point was substantially lower. Works fine, looks great and fits my KF snugly. No issues, highly recommend. This is also a \\"green\\" product for anyone who may be looking for that. They use some sort of sustainable production process or something. Talks about it on the package, I did not really care so I did not read the whole note.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am about hallway trough the book, and I can say it is well worth the read! The only problem with it is that I expect the cliffhanger to make up for an awfully long 2 years + wait for the sixth book...hence why I am taking my time reading it!<br /><br />All and all, if you've already started the series, you cannot overlook this guy.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Rented this from Redbox first, and had to have my own copy. Keeps you on the edge of your seat, the suspense is incredible. Not for children to see.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is an awesome app! Nothing compares! I love the fact that you can zoom in and also that they cross off the numbers once the row or column is fullfilled.
0345803485|1.0|After hearing about this book and all the hype along with it, I decided to buy it one day. It is a Best Seller so it's gotta be good, right? 18 dollars spent later, I had the book and was ready to read it. Fifty Shades of Ridiculous later, I found myself reading a not only overrated book, but a horribly written one. It was hard for me to get past the atrocious writing alone. Although I heard that the book isn't the best written book, admitted by E.L James herself, I never thought it would be so painful to read....I found the dialogue between the characters alone to be bipolar, a jumble of English grammar and American grammar. The author is English, and the characters are American, Washington residents, but you can swear they lived in Surrey, England for half their lives. How many American college students do you know \\"fetch\\" things, \\"ring\\" up their friends, and go on \\"holiday\\"? Oh let's not forget the 101 times the words \\"crap\\" was used by the main character. And if it wasn't just crap alone, it was \\"holy crap\\", \\"triple crap\\" or \\"super crap.\\" Has the author been to America or has she gotten her ideas while watching Twilight? And mix this in with language from the early 20th century, too formal to be spoken in 2012, and throw in some pretty hardcore out of place SAT words. My old high school English teacher, would have had his red marker out ready to make corrections with all the questionable syntax after reading this book. Was it proof read? And the amount of times the main characters are either muttering, murmuring, or whispering their words....Let's not even go there....<br /><br />Ok so the writing sucks, but how is the story? Let's get to the story and the characters....<br />So Christian Grey is this billionaire (not a millionaire, but a super billionaire), who is a fluent French speaker (which is quite believable), but he is also a classical pianist, a licensed helicopter pilot, athletic, gorgeous; a perfect Adonnis to be exact and the perfect lover. He is also a self made man, but he uses his money to combat world hunger. Oh yeah and all of this at the ripe old age of 27! Where did he have time to do all of this? And on top of that, he's never seen working. Instead, his time is spent having sex or thinking about sex (sex addict perhaps?) or texting, and emailing the female character, Anatasia. Expect Anatasia to have an email back from Christian instantly. How can the ultimate bachelor like Christian, the CEO, the extremely busy, powerful Adonnis that he is seem so available....Now let's get to the female character, Anna. Anna is a shy, naive, clumsy, inexperienced, pretty, but not drop dead gorgeous, intelligent, but not too sure of her self young woman, who just just graduated from college. But rather than this character being likable, she became annoying with her constant contemplating between her \\"subconscious\\" and her \\"inner goddess\\" and bickering. And then there's the repetition...expect Anatasia to bite her lip 101 times and her subconscious to say \\"crap\\" another 202 times. I will not get to the repetitious erotic words that were used that could of used a bit more imagination...Lets keep this PG rated.<br /><br />Then comes the sex scenes, but that's what the book is all about right? The juicy writing. The book started out a bit slow, and the the juicy stuff didn't take place until a quarter way through the book. The author really tried to build you up to what was coming up ahead. I would say the first steamy situation is the best, and I have to admit good and pretty entertaining, because it kept me interested to read more, but this is probably the best part of the book because after a couple more steamy encounters, it becomes too repetitious and too unbelievable that it becomes more laughable than erotic. It's a very long book. 500 pages to be exact, and if it was good, it wouldn't be a problem, but it loses its steam after 2/3 of the way through and it becomes too redundant and boring. By page 350, I was readyfor the story to end.<br /><br />So will I read the rest of the series? No. I think I'll save my $40. I guess this goes to show sex sells.

B0018QQQK8|4.0|This book is another amazing story by Nicholas Sparks, and one of my favorites by him! It's full of laughter, romance, action, and animals. An amazing mix of all the great things out there. Plus the movie is really good too! I suggest reading this book then seeing the movie. Hope you like it!(:

0345803485|3.0|Okay, I have to admit that I enjoyed this book, but in a way I'm disturbed that I did.  I think that all women have fantasies, and the fun is thinking about them while never expecting to act on them.  The idea of woman in bondage and being controlled by men goes against the grain of my soul.  I suppose in women's fantasies that we envision, if we're into that sort of thing,  being overpowered by movie star good looking men.  In reality, it doesn't happen that way.  The sexual details are very graphic in this book and I do wonder if it constitutes mommy porn, and that we read it on our Kindles in a clandestine fashion, where as holding up Playgirl wouldn't quite work.  The question is, will I read the other two books in the trilogy.  It's quite poorly written.

B000G8NXYQ|4.0|I love Federico Fellini.  I find his approach to film to be just beautifully composed; the perfect mixture of the serious and the lighthearted.  He understood how to combine these elements in a way that not only told a story but conveyed an emotion that was enriched by a feeling of true depth and authenticity.<br /><br />His films always felt grounded in reality.<br /><br />Of my favorite directors, he probably ranks second only to Jean-Luc Godard, who used that same balance to create films that were grounded in the complete opposite; the absurd.  Godard's films always leaned heavily on their absurdity, using it as a way to convey his messages, which Fellini leaned in the other direction, using the honesty in his scope to get his point across.  Both filmmakers were pioneers for the way we perceive film today and both deserve their respective places in that cinephile's list of influential filmmakers, and both topple nearly every director attempting cinema today.<br /><br />`Amarcord' is a perfect example of Fellini's ability to convey feeling.  Throughout the film's running length we are filled with the delightfulness that is found in Fellini's nostalgic trip down memory lane.  As he fills the frame, and our hearts, with these colorful creatures (not all as effective or enjoyable as the others) we cannot help but be intrigued by their presence and their inevitable effect on each other and ourselves.  Where `Amarcord' falls flat is in that development of story, which is something that isn't always necessary in film but something that felt particularly missing here.  I felt its lack thereof, and that to me means that it needed to be present.  The collection of random situations and events that link this seaside town together is all fun and games, but at the end of the day I feel as though I am left with little more than an emotion.  `Amarcord' doesn't affect my thinking or provoke my interest in anything substantial and it doesn't cause me to meditate on the events portrayed.<br /><br />It is sadly a tad forgettable.<br /><br />That isn't to say that the film is bad, for it is actually pretty great.  From a technical standpoint it is flawless.  The direction is sharp, the editing is key (it flows beautifully) and the cinematography is gorgeous.  The score is essential, for it draws out the desired emotions, and the acting as an ensemble is very good, with the exception of Armando Brancia, who is an annoyance and a bother.  Magali Noel is wonderful, and Bruno Zanin, who is probably the closest thing to a protagonist this film has, is also fantastic.<br /><br />I wish it had a linear storyline, only because I think it is missing that glue that would hold this collection of `scenes' together, but as a cinematic experience it is hard to fault Fellini's emotion filled ballad to his yesteryears.trayed.<br /><br />It is sadly a tad forgettable.<br /><br />That isn't to say that the film is bad, for it is actually pretty great.

B0064W67IM|1.0|The poor rating is not for content, rather that it is limited for just the Kindle Fire and android devices.  I have an iPad 3, and use my Kindle app for all my books.  This really ticks me off. You lose this sale, Amazon.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|I hesitate to review books I really enjoy, because I struggle to define exactly what it is I love and write something other than 'why are you not reading this book already omgggggg' (only with more caps lock)  With Gardens of the Moon, the first book in the Malazan series, I honestly did not know what I thought of it when I reached the end.  I read the entire thing, set it down, and went, 'what did I just read?'  I wasn't certain about the world, I didn't really relate to any of the characters, and I figured I'd not touch the rest.  It kept eating at me though until I bought the second book and now I'm hooked.<br /><br />The prose gets a bit thick at times.  The world requires you to think in order to keep up.  The magic is more intuition than explanation.  The plot is not straight-forwards and there are lots of seeming sub-plots. This is not what I would call an easy read.  If you're okay with not having everything presented to you, then this book is certainly worth it.  It's an interesting and complex world.  It's dark, to the point where it hurts to read.  I pause between each book and read something light and easy to give my mind a break before starting the next.  I imagine it's going to be a love it or hate it book for a lot of people.  If you decide to try it, stick it out until the end, wait a few days, and then decide whether or not you want to continue.  It took some time for me to realize I was still interested and after that, I've been absolutely riveted.
6305428298|2.0|`Little Voice' opens with a lot of noise, most of that coming out of Brenda Blethyn's mouth.  As the foul mouthed, self-centered, promiscuous mother to the film's primary protagonist, Blethyn practices the `more is more' philosophy and she drenches every scene with her fast-talking verbal drool.  She's like the British variation of Melissa Leo's Oscar winning mommy-dearest in `The Fighter'; always having something to say regardless of the fact that you wish she'd just shut up.<br /><br />But enough about Blethyn.<br /><br />`Little Voice' tells the story of a young reclusive girl named LV (short for Little Voice).  Her mother is oppressive and seems to have little regard for her daughter and her dreamy fantasies about famous lounge singers and the like.  Instead, LV is left to suffer in silence as her mother shakes her tail all over town and harbors her own dreams of shacking up with Ray Say, a local talent manager who books shows for a theater of questionable taste.  When Ray hears LV's big gift (she can almost expertly imitate the vocal stylings of famed singers like Garland and Monroe) he is starstruck.  He sees gold in his eyes and does everything in his power to get LV to make his dreams come true.<br /><br />At the heart of `Little Voice' is a story of lost individuals trying to find happiness amidst other people who constantly drag them down.  LV is the obvious heroine mostly because her mother is the chief antagonist and her shelter existence is the film's core obstacle to overcome.  Sadly, not much about `Little Voice' feels genuine.  It just kind of lays there.  We know that LV is haunted by her past, mostly which involving her late father and the relationship that he had with her feisty mother, but it doesn't really feel heartfelt.  It feels gimmicky.  The film also doesn't have the right balance between the dramatics and the comedic, for it breezes through scenes that should have felt deeper panned.<br /><br />Blethyn received an Oscar nomination for her crazed portrayal of LV's mother, Mari.  She does a fine job.  It's a spastic and attention grabbing performance, and it was designed that way.  I can't say she was anything special because there seemed to be a shallow depth there, which is mostly the scripts fault but it could have been mined by Blethyn a little better.  Jane Horrocks is meekish and reclusive, like her character, but it is a fault to the film because she disappears.  One writes her off and doesn't care much for following her character's arc.  She needed to add some spark or at least some layer of emotional relevance to get her character to register and she doesn't do that.  Ewan, and actor who I generally adore, is horrible here.<br /><br />And then there is Michael Caine.  When people think of this movie, if they aren't thinking about Caine then they obviously haven't watched this movie yet.  His delivery of `It's Over' is not only the finest scene in the film but possible the most memorable and emotionally impacted scene in the year of film that was 1998.  It is a searing performance, one that comes full circle in a way that feels complete, authentic and appropriate.<br /><br />His lack of Oscar attention was disgusting.<br /><br />At the end of the day, `Little Voice' lacks the voice to pull off such a story.  It really needed deeper impact, especially from LV herself, but the film is basically left in Michael Caine's hands, and while he delivers a staggering performance, this is not his story and he can only do so much.crazed portrayal of LV's mother, Mari.

B004JN1D2I|2.0|With all the hoopla surrounding this book and the HBO cable series, I expected more. It's not the genre, but the execution. I find myself losing interest every couple of pages, which is not normal--I often finish (good) books in one sitting.<br /><br />Kindle edition: There needs to be a master Table of Contents to enable you to go DIRECTLY to Book 2, 3, 4. Each book has previews of the next book tacked on at the end. When you HAVE the actual next book, this is annoying and redundant. You can only PAGE FORWARD to get past the added junk, to get to the next book.  DUMB. FRUSTRATING. AMATEUR.<br /><br />There are so many characters, relationships, and places to remember that having these books in paperback would make more sense.<br /><br />The bookmark function seems worthless--until you can add links/name the bookmarks, they have no discernable value.<br /><br />I'm 30% through the series. Simply don't care about ANY of the characters yet. I doubt that I'll finish the second book.  ZZZZZZZZZZ.

B005LAIGNC|1.0|Very disappointed with this movie.  After waiting weeks and weeks thinking it would be a quality movie about some great hero's of WW II; I watched maybe 50% before giving up on it.  Not a good representation of these brave men who were the Red Tail fliers.  Very poor acting, missing information on the actual individuals who performed a great service to our country and other fliers.  I can't understand how it could have been so highly recommended by others for there is no way would I recommend it to any one!
1594744769|4.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children centers on 16 year-old Jacob, a boy who was once entranced by his grandfather's stories about the children that he knew while growing up--children with special abilities. However, now that Jacob is older, he no longer believes the tales of levitating girls and invisible boys, dismissing the stories as mere entertainment. But, when his grandfather dies a horrifying, mysterious death, Jacob makes it his mission to uncover the truth behind his dying grandfather's cryptic final words.<br /><br />Jacob's journey takes him to a small island near Wales, where he discovers that his grandfather was telling the truth--that these children do, and still, exist.  And, just as he becomes entwined in the lives of the children and their headmistress, Miss Peregrine, a new danger arrives to the island, threatening their lives. It soon becomes a race against the clock for Jacob and his new friends to find a way of escaping the creatures that are hunting them down.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home is a charming, fast-paced, and exciting read from beginning to end. The children are enchanting, the main character (Jacob) is genuine, and the plot is well-executed.  Pictures of the peculiar children are scattered throughout the story, helping to feed the imagination.  Adding to the story's creepy ambiance is the fact that these pictures are old, vintage snapshots that the author has collected from flea markets and swap meets.<br /><br />This novel was an easy, quick read, and I would recommend it to anyone of any age--particularly those that enjoy science fiction, the paranormal, the creepy, and the peculiar.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Meryl Streep is an incredible actress and she does not disaapoint in The Iron Lady.

This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is diffently worth the time to watch.

0739378481|1.0|I'm going to give away some stuff, so don't read if that's objectionable<br /><br />Ok, Reacher was always an implausible character, but it was fun. He's able to do horrible and noble things and then just drift away. Who wouldn't like that? In this one, his implausibility goes over the top, jumps the shark etc. In this novel, Reacher murders four people in cold blood. A militia nut, ok maybe. But he actually kills a US Army special forces colonel IN HIS OFFICE IN THE PENTAGON, and then walks away. And then he goes back down to bubba town where he kills a sitting US Senator and his highly decorated national celebrity war hero son. And again, no consequences whatsoever. There's no inquiry, there's no investigation, there are no reporters, there's the sound of crickets and female regret as Reacher drifts away.<br /><br />It's getting into science fiction territory

B0050OMJIW|4.0|There are probably thousands of reviews regarding this book, and I will not endeavor to review such a literary giant. So I will simply give my honest opinion regarding the story.<br /><br />I have laughed, cried and been furious simultaneously on a few occasions while reading this book, and I do believe it is one of those books that everybody should read at least once. If you are an avid reader you will not be disappointed here. If you are more of a casual story seeker, you will probably find some sections of this book difficult and cumbersome, but I would still recommend giving it a go as the exquisite humor mixed in with some truly head scratching moments make up for it.

B00009NQQO|5.0|Despite other negative reviews, I found this Alex Toy to be great. It stays stuck to the wall even when my son pulls and tugs on it. I have a tile wall and I cleaned the title with rubbing alcohol prior to attaching the toy and it works great. Another review recommended cutting a hole in the bottom for the balls to pass through but I do not recommend cutting a hole in the bottom. My son was happier with the toy when the balls stayed in net. Great toy. I recommend it.

0385737947|5.0|Let me start off this review with the one bad thing about this book: the lingo that the characters use is, to me, annoying (and when you read the book, you will get what I'm saying). It's simple to get over and continue reading (because it is worth it) but it's worth putting that out there.<br /><br />As for the good, this book caught my attention quickly (which I loved because I don't like reading books that drag on and on), it kept my attention, and the story line was refreshing. There are a lot of books out there now with the whole dystopian theme (which I enjoy) and I find that a lot of them are sort of repetitive. The Maze Runner, however, is not repetitive at all. The author does an excellent job of giving you just enough information to keep you reading, keeping you on the edge of your seat waiting for more details, but not keeping too much from you that you get sick of not having all the answers. The end of the book scared the poo out of me, and if you are like me (and can't watch scary movies at night) then I would recommend finishing this book during the day. Overall, This book was an excellent read, and I would recommend it to other readers.<br /><br />As a reference, I also enjoyed Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games, and Veronica Rossi's Under the Never Sky.
0345803485|5.0|This is an AWESOME book! HIGHLY recommend it to anyone, male or female. I have never been sexually aroused by a book, but this one did it for me!  I can't wait to get the next one in the series!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Can't even believe there are people who like this book and it is a Bestseller? REALLY? Come on... Leaving out the erotica part of the book which is all it is really about, the writing in this book is awfully bad...

0061692042|5.0|THE STORY...<br /><br /> \\"First  I'll tell about the bank robbery our parents committed.<br />  Then about the murders, which happened later\\"<br /><br /> This was the beginning of then 15 year old Dell Parson's story told through the now adult eyes of 60 year old Dell living as a teacher and reaching back through the years trying to make sense of his traumatic childhood.<br /> Living a somewhat simple life in 1960's Montana, things go downhill quickly when an act of incredible and almost comical stupidity shatters his young life forever.<br /> Beverly and Neeva Parsons the parents of Dell and his twin sister Berner decide in order to get some much needed cash that they must rob a bank. Of course things go terribly wrong and the children are set adrift in an uncaring world when their parents are taken to jail.<br /> So begins the end of childhood for Dell. Berner eventually runs away and Dell is then rescued by his mothers friend Mildred and taken to Canada, dropped off with her brother in a whole new world unlike any he has been familiar with.<br /> His new guardian, Arthur Remlinger is an enigmatic and reclusive man who owns a somewhat rundown hotel mainly for goose hunters with many questionable people around and, who we later find out has been running from the law for close to 30 years with people still in pursuit and this results in the murders Dell is unfortunately a witness to.<br /><br />MY STORY...<br /><br />I loved this book. The way it is written kept me turning page after page, beautiful prose, no word out of place. My heart ached for Dell and his sister who through no fault of their own were caught up in their parents incredibly stupid, selfish act.<br /> The parents are so not suited to be together or to parent anything much less a child. I have always said...\\"just because you can, does not mean that you should.\\"<br /> The story is a classic coming of age tale, how or if we survive our childhood and how this shapes us as adults.<br />Dell handled the traumatic events in his childhood with grace and generosity unlike his sister Berner who seemed to have not been able to cope well with the trauma of her life.<br /><br />A most excellent read!raumatic events in his childhood with grace and generosity unlike his sister Berner who seemed to have not been able to cope well with the trauma of her life.<br /><br />A most excellent read!
B005FISC52|5.0|Amazon is the greatest. I have been ordering the One Tree Hill DVD every Season and they are always every prompt in mailing it out.  I am just upset that One Tree Hill has ended for good. What a fantastic show that was. Thank you Amazon for having all of the DVD's available through all 9 seasons.<br /><br />Sue
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is alwsys the first game I will check on my kindle everyday. I think maybe the paid version has more words options. however the free version is fun enough to play.
B00821OW8K|5.0|Falling Skies is a perfectly timed show from TNT. With all of the prepping tv shows and obvious economic instability, it's clear that society is becomming more and more weary about SOMETHING happening that may collapse civilization as we know it. Falling Skies responds to this societal wikiality through their post-alien invasion setting with dynamic characters and believable (albeit science fiction) scenarios of the logistical nightmare it would be to simply survive in a post-apocalyptic setting. I encourage you to give this show a chance. It will suck you in.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|Good board. Not GREAT... but good. Solid heatsinks on MOSFETs help with some mild over clocking. Board is quality made. Immediately updated to latest BIOS via super easy to use BIOS tool.<br />if you can get the UD7, then go for it. If you cant then this board will do.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This seems to be a very good cover.  It holds my Kindle Fire snugly and protects it very well, the elastic band keeps the cover in place when I'm not using it and even works to help me hold it in my hand.  The stand works although it does slip occasionally.  My only real complaint right now is that I decided the other day that it looks a little too utilitarian, they could put some kind of a design or embossing in the cover and give it some style.  Another color choice would be nice, too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|several easy games...and several more challenging ones.  great free game!!! with hours of play. Very good for a kindle or larger screened devices.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|seems easy enough then around level 24 it gets stupid.insane.  almost forced me to buy coins to continue....almost!!!!  great fun
0345803485|5.0|I never liked to read! Cannot take my eyes off of this book! So full of curiosity to read books 2and 3! Great book! I don't get it how some people can give it just one star!
B005KELW26|5.0|I'm pretty impressed with this cover. I got the deep purple color. I was not looking for a stand-case or anything fancy, so if that's what you want then this is not for you.<br /><br />It is a simple open and close cover case kind of like a book. It holds the Kindle Fire with four leather straps. The straps keep it tight and secure so you do not have to worry about it coming out or anything. There isn't even wiggle room once the Kindle is strapped in.<br /><br />I would not classify the case as high-level protection. However, for daily use and comfortable reading it is an awesome product. I can place it in my purse and I don't have to worry about my keys or objects scratching my Kindle.
0375842209|5.0|Have read for the third [but not final] time!  Am more affected each time--laugh (a little), cry (a lot), astounded by all the characters (for different reasons), breaks my heart, and restores my soul!  Absolutely beautiful and beyond horrible at the same time.

B001EPYQO6|5.0|Awesome movie and remaked on bluray with new colors, Sound, picture, uncut scenes and  most of all, the details on every character. A must buy item.<br /><br />Regards,
0307719774|4.0|This journal is an amazing idea!! I love working on it with my fiancee and hope to work on it with my children in the future. This will be such a cool family heirloom that I will want to pass down thru the generations. I might buy a few more copies so my kids, grandkids, great-grandkids, etc.... Will be able to write about things over 5 years. This is just such an awesome journal that I would definitely recommend!!! Only drawback is the book is a little bit on the smaller side so there isn't a lot of room to write. But it does force to be concise about what your writing. The book is a little stiff too but it loosens up after you use it for a little bit.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was a great book Enjoyed every page.  Just wish there were more titles by this author. Would recommend this book to any audult reader.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Really enjoy. Have not played a matching game in a while. Graphics are fun. Colors are bright.  Have a great time playing
0375704027|4.0|This is a book about death, about the idea of death. For this reason, I encourage everyone past coming of age to read it.  It will perhaps force you to contemplate the subject so often ignored. Norwegian Wood is a great place for such a start, with its honest, sobering meditation on the idea of death.<br /><br />The book is written in a vintage Murasaki style: slow, painfully at times, but beautifully prosed. Every page you get closer peak inside the headspace of a man, Watanabe, somewhat damaged by the death of his best friend. He is drawn to others who were just as damaged, perhaps seeking refuge in each other's communal defects. Unable to cope with reality, many characters throughout the book choose to end their lives, abruptly, as if to punctuate that their lives really meant nothing. Then the stories become about those whom they left behind, about their struggles and often failed attempts to cope. 'Death' doesn't end when people are buried; it continues on as scars, layering one after another, on their friends, families, and loved ones.<br /><br />Through all this, Watanabe learns to accept death as part of life. It's natural. It can't be fought. It can't be prepared for.  I love the ending of the novel: you get the feeling that he hadn't quite recover from the pain, and maybe never will, but at the same time, you feel hopeful for him.
0007144350|5.0|He didn't write that much, so it's easy enough to own--and read--it all. And it's all worth reading. I particularly like his literary criticism, which is just as entertaining as his fiction and drama. Sure you can pick and choose, and it's easier to read \\"Earnest\\" in a slimmer edition. But eventually (trust me), you will want it all.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|To live a holy life daily, we need to read and meditate on God 's word daily. Youversion Bible app. will help you to do that. I really love this app.It is very User friendly.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|This CD is another good work that this band has a huge repertoire valuable. Note, however, is not as inspiring as the band's other albums. The CD 2 (extra) is the same line. It is a sound mixing light with heavier guitar parts. It is still a good work, but only that it is not the best of Porcupine Tree. Valley for the fans and for those who like progressive rock. Good to Very Good!
0143118706|4.0|I enjoyed this book as it is an engaging memoir and the author is willing to be honest here.  She has done extensive research in the area of marriage and i enjoyed reading that. However, there were multiple points that appeared repetitive where she was attempting to emphasize which can be a turn off.<br /><br />After reading the book i felt that she is taking a very safe approach towards marriage which does help in relearning all the assumptions one may have prior to reading his book but of course be mindful and read it as per her context instead.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I can't seem to get enough of the games! Some are a little challenging but you earn points quickly to move on to the games.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|For the most part, I enjoyed watching this film once. However, I have a few issues.<br /><br />For one, Liam Neeson plays a skilled hunter, so why couldn't he have set traps for the wolves? In the wild, traps are a key to catching food and defending your territory from bears and other predators. The entire movie is about a bunch of people scared to death of a bunch of wolves, so they keep running from the wolves until they tire out and die. Not very interesting. They killed one damn wolf throughout the entire film, really? With 8 men, winter or summer, those men should have been having a barbeque every night with an entree of wolves.<br /><br />Second, I doubt wolves would act like this. There is far easier prey to capture than trying to hunt and kill 7 humans with fire, knives and spears. Full grown humans just aren't on the preferred menu for wolves. Being alone maybe another situation, but 7 people should have survived, maybe not the cold, but certainly the wolves.<br /><br />Third, I love Liam Neeson's characters in his films. However, it seems that in every movie he has lost someone, whether it be a wife or daughter. In every movie I have watched he loses something which brings about his motivation for the rest of the film (Batman Begins, Seraphim Falls, Taken and so forth). Maybe he likes playing vengeful or pitiful characters, I don't know, but it is getting a little old.<br /><br />I will continue to watch Liam's films, because he is a good actor. I also love survival movies, so this was on the menu tonight. However, my arguments above leave me placing a three star review for this film.
0545265355|5.0|I was very pleased with my buy of the Hunger Games Trilogy.  They're such great books.  I can hardly put them down! I am really happy with my purchase and would recommend these books to anyone.  Actually I've already recommended them to all my friends who haven't read them!  And if you're going to purchase the set I would definitely recommend springing the little extra for the hard cover books.  They're just so much nicer and remain in better shape over a longer period of time, especially since you'll pry be recommending and lending the books out to all your friends once you've read them!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great game! definitely get it. The game is challenging, but fun. There are a lot of levels that will keep you entertained for hours on end.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Definitely a time consumer. Love playing all day. Takes a lot of time to earn money but that is what makes it fun.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|For those who loved the books, you will love the movie. It put me in the mind of a swedish silence of the lambs. Very much looking forward to the next two films!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great game play, interface design, love it. It is like a blend of Minesweeper, sudoku, and Dell Magazine logic problems, all rolled into one.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I love Harry Bosch. Can't help it. This is one character that I'm fully attached to. He makes me furious on occasion, but for the most part, I adore him.<br /><br />THE OVERLOOK is classic Bosch. Misunderstood, side-lined by the Feds, but still bull-dozing right through a murder investigation turned biological terrorist threat. Or has it? Bosch is the only detective with the insight to catch several clever misdirections by the criminals. Misdirections that, once unraveled, reveal a surprising chain of events.<br /><br />In addition to staying on top of the investigation, Bosch must deal with the doubts of a new partner and the re-introduction of his former lover, FBI agent Rachel Walling. His hard-headedness wins him no fans among the Feds and serious doubt from the LAPD, but Bosch follows his gut and proves that he's still on top of his game as a detective.<br /><br />Well worth the read!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I started this, I knew nothing about the book other than reading the reviews.  I decided if that many people liked it, I would give it a try.  As I started the book, I felt I had bought just another typical doomsday book.  Boy was I wrong.  This is about a beginning, not the end.  It shows a struggle for a man's conquest over tyranny and how easily tyranny can be justified for the public good.  It provides a good lesson for all of us when we are tempted to give up our freedoms for safety and security.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|This series only seems to have that upward climb effect. I hope they keep getting better. I gave this season a 5 star mark because it well surpassed the first season with twists and turns. The writing is a lot more solid. The first season was also a good season just season two is better. I think both seasons had pivotal endings and season two was no different. Looking forward to season 3. :)
155890641X|5.0|Recieved the movie on time, and I'm very pleased with it.  I'm very happy about being able to still purchase the VCR.  Enjoying the movie very much.

159514188X|2.0|My rating: 2/5 stars<br /><br />*May contain some spoilers*<br />In the beginning we beet Clay. Clay seems like a sweet guy who had a crush on Hannah, a girl who killed herself. But before her suicide she recorded 13 tapes; tapes, that will tell you why she killed herself.<br /><br />Really love the sound of it, right? I did, so I just couldn't wait to read it! I had just read Hate List and Speak and was expecting something as amazing!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book just wasn't worth the hype. I was waiting for something huge, a great book dealing with difficult subject with some suspence. But that really wasn't what I got.<br /><br />First of all, there's two POVs; Clays, and Hannah reading her tapes. It was really confusing! It seems like a great idea, but these two were mixed so completely it was hard to know who's POV I was reading. So sometimes it took me two pages before I realized I was reading Hannah's POV, not Clays! And had to read it all over again. That was quite annoying. But otherwise the writing was okay.<br /><br />What can I say about the characters.. Well, Clay really is a sweet boy, who had a crush on Hannah. And that was actually his only mistake. Having a crush on her, I mean.<br />Because of that, he becomes one of Hannah's victims. You might think that since he's on the tapes, he must have done something horrible to Hannah, right? Well, not exactly. So I just feel bad for the poor boy! But at least Clay's character was believable and likable.<br /><br />But Hannah.. Oh, Hannah. I was waiting this tortured soul, a depressed teenager who had horrible life and that's why she ended it. But.. Yeah, it just didn't work!<br />I know, this book was suppose to be about how everyone should think about their actions because they might effect other people. But I didn't learn that kind of lesson from the book. All I learned was that Hannah really is a b*tch!<br />First she kills herself because she feels like it. But that wasn't enough! She records tapes where she blames other people for her own actions. Well, at least she acts like a stupid teenager! So guess that part is actually believable.<br />She's one of those weak characters who just likes to blame other people all the time. And now she haunts them from the grave! How wrong is that. Yeah, there was like two people who actually deserved to receive the tapes and who actually did something wrong. All the others were stuff like \\"omg, he said my ass is the best looking ev&ouml;, i so wanna die now!\\". WTH?<br />Sure, everyone's different, but if that is your biggest problem..<br />And who is she to blame anyone else, when she did nothing when she should've? Like witnessing a rape and doing nothing. She's just acting all passive bystander, who can do nothing. And that is why I hate her so much. Because I don't like people who act like victim all the time. They complain and then.. do nothing. Hello, ever heard of something like \\"the police\\"??<br /><br />When I read the book, tape by tape, I was waiting for some huge revelation. I mean, since she killed herself, there must be a reason. Something had to be the last straw that finally made her decide \\"today I'm going to kill myself\\". If that's something you'd like to read about, don't read this book. Seriously. Because you wait and you wait, but you'll never get the huge revelation.<br />Also, if you're one of those readers who like to cry because the book is so emotional, again, avoid this book. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't shed a tear. And believe me, I tried!<br />There was this one scene where Hannah was all devastated and crying and you know it's suppose to be all emotional and you're suppose to be crying, but no matter how much I tried, I couldn't cry. Because it wasn't actually that sad scene, it was just silly girl making a fuss.<br /><br />So, this really sounded like a great book, but really.. wasn't. I expected something awesome and meaningful, but it really wasn't believable. I did like Clay,so that's why I gave two cupcakes instead of just one.<br /><br />Love,<br />Monaliz @ Mind Reading?hat's why I gave two cupcakes instead of just one.<br /><br />Love,<br />Monaliz @ Mind Reading?

B007R3AZNK|5.0|Just got the MP3s of Joe's new album and can sum it up as follows...Slow Burnin' Blues!  This is not the young guy trying to impress with lightning riffs and edgy lyrics...this is BLUES. Blues Deluxe, while a great album for that stage in Joe's career, was just that...good for where he was. Fortunately for us, he is where he is, not where he was! Each new album that Joe puts out shows a deepening understanding for and creative genius in the realm of the BLUES. Keep it up, my friend!  I can hardly wait until you go on the road with this one, as I firmly believe that seeing you LIVE is the best way to GET Joe, the Blues Man. Favorites on the album include Disolcated Boy, Heavenly Soul and Too Much Ain't Enough Love - the collaboration with Jimmy Barnes on vocals is stellar way to end the album. The song Driving Towards the Daylight evokes a similar feeling (feeling...not lyric) as Sloe Gin...but for me, Sloe Gin is Master Class.<br />Also recommend Walter Trout's new effort - Blues for the Modern Daze.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is to much.  If you want this type of read please mark as graphic kinky sex novel.  Nothing good about it.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|The characters, plot and world building were absolutely spot-on.<br /><br />There were some oddities of editing that barely registered against the otherwise sheer pleasure of reading this book.  (I get that \\"Coummounwealth spoelling\\" is occasionally entirely bizarre to us Americans, but \\"led\\" for \\"lead\\" in EVERY case?  E.g. \\"What would led you to believe that?\\"  That has just got to be a search/replace gone haywire!  Please tell me this is not current British usage, and please, Anthony, fix this in future releases!)<br /><br />I look forward to the sequel (current working title is Tower Lord).  I may even sample the author's (dark?) SF series in the meantime, though these days I much prefer good fantasy.
1401937268|5.0|I have found this set to be positive, informative, and enlightening. It doesn't use pictures or words to scare the crap out of you. Only informative and enlightening information. I LOVE this set, my favorite of all my sets. Yes Yes Yes....this is worth every penny!!!!

B006YZHEB8|5.0|My grandson and I previewed this movie. It was his 3RD time to see it--He really likes it!!  It shows real life situations that require Godly men to step up to the plate and place their families first.  It inspires them to live out their faith in their everyday lives.  We placed the movie in our church library.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|loved this game and was super addicted but then it wouldnt let me load and kept saying &quot;updating&quot;. I then lost everything and I was on level 18. Loved this game so much I re downloaded it and then at level 12 it did the same thing. very upset. Not worth it anymore. So I uninstalled ire a second time and WILL NOT RE INSTALL. Thievish for the Kindle Fire
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great basic solitare game. Nice graphics, easy ito play. You can select a random deal or a  winning deal, which isn't always easy to win. Nice game.
B001AKTZOQ|4.0|I wanted a remix of \\"Cosmo`s Factory\\" and I could not find the 24k gold disc at a reasonable price,so I finely broke down and bought this 40th.anniversary reissue of \\"Cosmo`s Factory\\".I am very happy with the sound of this CD.In my opinion the sound has more depth,not just more volume.I could hear a difference,not that the original CD release is that bad,but I will play this issue from now on.<br /><br />I had stayed away from this 40th.anniversary release for a long time because of the extra tracks.I like to put in a CD and let it play through,so I figured I wouldn`t want to hear the extra tracks each time I played the CD..I was right the extra tracks are not very repayable.I guess I will program my CD player for tracks 1-11 to avoid hearing the extras every time I Play \\"Cosmos Factory\\".Don`t get me wrong the tracks are interesting,but belong in a lost recordings set not on the classic album.Adding these extra tracks was kind of like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app for reading the Bible. It has every translation you can think of and is very easy to use. I like that you can also listen if you don't feel like reading at the moment.  This also helps with pronouncing the words correctly.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|I usually don't write review, and even less buy apps for my Kindle Fire (there is so many good free apps!).<br />But I have to confess that I'm so glad I bought this one.<br />As a photography lover having a lot (a lot a lot!) of pictures on my Picasa account, I wanted to be able to access them easily and in full screen, which is not possible using Amazon Silk.<br />This app gives me exactly what I wanted: Fast access, very easy to use, high quality in full screen (a picture uploaded in 800dpi will look very great in full screen mode on a Kindle Fire).<br />I now just need a WiFi connection to access all my pictures anywhere! Perfect!<br />Thank you!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|yea this is good. good game. I would get it again. I like uding swords and stuff. play hood games
B000002KHH|5.0|Warm sounding CD recording ,and for the price this CD more then does the job!<br />This review is on the plane old ordinary Paranoid CD,not any fancy remixed, repackaged releases..No I have not heard the remixed CD versions of Paranoid,if they really sound that much better then that is great.
B0081X40HW|5.0|I loved Haley on American Idol and followed as best I could once the season was over.  When she debuted her first single \\"Free\\" I was intrigued.  When I realized it was time for her completed album to drop I hurried up over here to Amazon and downloaded.  In the last two days I have listened in its entirty a half a dozen times and each time I enjoy it a bit more.  First listen I was just amazed at how much she has grown up vocally from the beginning of American Ido to now.  My favorite two songs are Undone and Free.  This a spectacular start to what I hope will be a long and strong career for Haley Reinhart.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been thinking about why I've avoided reading Wool until now.  I even passed on getting Wool 1, when it was offered for free one day.  Somehow, just the thought of a silo civilization made me feel closed in, shut in, claustrophobic.<br /><br />Then one day, the heck with it, I bought the Omnibus.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />There's a whole civilization here.  Journeys take days and sometimes lives.  It's great.  Don't hesitate, read it.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really loved this book about two people who are just drawn to each other magnetically.  It was incredible!  I can't wait til book 2 to read more about Gideon and Eva.  Loved how neither of them were innocent, made for some really, really hot love scenes.
B004LWZWDS|5.0|A timeless tale and instant classic that looks like it was filmed yesterday.  When this movie came out back in 1988 I convinced the owner of a local rural movie theater to run it in his smaller theater.  He was convinced his rural audience wouldn't be interested in an 18th century costume drama in France, but I pointed out that his theater was in a college town and the snobby-wobby university intellectuals were starving for 18th century costume dramas!  Plus there were plenty of locals like me who were also starving for good stories and good acting.  The movie in his theater was a hit!  Not big enough to move to the larger downstairs theater, but big enough for him to make a tidy little profit, which is, of course, the aim of that game.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Very pointless, boring game, which nonetheless is a total time sink because collecting little coins is quite addictive.  It's a classic example of games which let you do far too little before you are forced to pay for access to any more of the game.  Don't download it!
B00846REIS|3.0|I read 50 shades of gray first and found this book to be as close to plagerism as you could get without directly stealing!! The story is so similar is is like dejavu.  It is okay but 50 shades is so much better because the story felt original.  I was looking for books similar to 5o shades but not necessarily an exact match!!

B007BFSYMS|5.0|I often have dreams where I am riding a bike. Lately, I've been falling off the bike after only a few seconds (which in a dresm is even less than a few seconds, especially if you are 2 or 3 levels deep). Now that I have this, I can keep at it. Last night I think I rode in the bike part of a triathlon! I Couldn't recommend this more!

B006UG90RM|2.0|I am an old fan of Van Halen, but come on guys. The rythms are the same just different words. Roth sounds old and stressed. I have read reviews by some who have said new fans will like this garbage. I had 10 yound fans listen to it and 8 out of 10 called it crap and said they wouln't waste the money either. Want my money back.................SAVE YOUR MONEY NOT WORTH IT!
B008458O3S|1.0|Opened once. After that wouldn't open at all on my Fire. Very disappointing. Enjoyed the little time I did play.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|I have no complaints about the book itself. It's entertaining, insightful and well researched.<br /><br />It is almost unreadable in Kindle format.<br /><br />I have a Kindle Touch.  I frequently found myself accidentally hitting a footnote when I simply wished to turn a page. This propelled me to the bibilography with no way to return to my \\"last read\\" point in the text.<br /><br />Again, if I actually meant to read a footnote, I was suddenly hundreds of pages away from my \\"last read\\" point in the text and could not find my way home with a map and a flashlight.<br /><br />The book itself is wonderful, and I would recommend it. But the Kindle format is extremely difficult to navigate.<br /><br />If you want to read this book, purchase it in the traditional paper form. You'll find it much more informative(as you can actually check the footnotes) and also easier to navigate.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like this app but frequency of ads is increasing. guess ill have to pay for an ad free app
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|didnt buy this but still gameloft put in  a warning for the file size (which is more than the fire can hold)!
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|I have to say I disagree with a number of people here in that I think that the original swedish version of this book was much better than this \\"Hollywood\\" one.<br />Most of the time I find the original first ones(european) better than the american ones....<br />But maybe the mainstream audience is not used to the different pace of european (or also asian)movies.<br />Of course that might also have to do with the foreign language and the subtitles.<br />It's just easier to see a movie in your own language....<br />The acting here was decent but not as good as from the swedish actors I thought.<br />Daniel Graig is not a Blomquist.<br />And the girl was also a bit flat in her dynamic I felt.<br />I am sure a lot of people won\\"t agree with me but that's ok.<br />If you haven't seen the swedish trilogy do yourself a favor and at least check it out.

0307346617|1.0|I like the premise, and the first chapter was promising, but the character development is terrible!  As others have suggested, the characters are so outrageously cliche-ridden and the dialogue is so monotonous that there is no possible way I'm going to be able to finish this thing.  It's slovenly writing.  To say nothing of the fact that they all sound the same, no person I know of speaks the way these characters do.  And if it's meant to be satire, where is the wit?  It's just so corny and dumb.  Seriously, what a way to squander an otherwise great book concept, and I can only hope the movie is better.
1401937519|5.0|I love this book; it has been eminently helpful to me -- as though it has given \\"permission\\" to trust that which we all sense/know as children but are trained to \\"forget.\\" Reading this book feels like coming home, and I am grateful beyond words to the generosity of the writer for sharing her keen perception and received insights, clarity and wisdom.  The dimension to which Ms. Moorjani re-introduces us is mystical beyond description, and as real as the floor beneath my feet. The true measure of alchemy. The weaving and reweaving of all that is. Thank you!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|What else is there to say?  I LOVE THIS GAME!!!  The graphics are clear &amp; sharp and the game itself is addictive.  It borders on being obsessive. If you are one of the many people out there with OCD, you might want to reconsider getting this game.
B000K7MMP4|2.0|This adaptation, while superior to the 2005 Kiera Knightley abomination, doesn't even enter the same zip code as the 1995 A&E masterpiece. There are reviewers here who actually think this better follows the book? Really? Sure, there is a lot of Austen's dialogue, but it is kind of awkwardly recited rather than acted well, and some of the characterizations are way off. Mr. Bennet comes off as a real jerk...barking at everyone and openly sneering at his wife, Mary gets far more attention in the script than she should....and what is up with her getting some of Elizabeth's lines and gossiping about Wickham and finally, making eyes at Bingley? Did I miss something in the source material? Kitty trying to flirt with Bingley and crying all the time and coughing so much....taking an amusing joke from the book and bludgeoning it until I assumed she had asthma or consumption. And I know looks are subjective but Jane Bennet looked distractingly like Lily Tomlin. There is no way on earth I could buy her as a beauty. Mr. Darcy was handsome but possessed none of Firth's ability to let us see what is happening behind his eyes. He recited his lines and looked so cold most of the time he uncomfortably started to seem like a Regency era psychopath. When he approached Elizabeth from behind and asked her to dance a reel, I thought he was going to sink a knife between her shoulderblades. Handsome but creepy. The production values are really poor, it looks cheaply done and the transitions are awful. There is little to no imagination in the script....resorting to Lizzie inner monologues in case the audience doesn't get it? It was awkward and weird, especially for someone who knows the book so well. I love how the 1995 version added some key scenes from Darcy's perspective....not in the book, but it helps us understand him and root for them more....this is a movie adaptation, not a book recital. Faithfulness is good, but there should be some imagination as well. Anyway, at least this is better than the dreadful 1940s version and the 2005 disaster. But the 1995 one is the definitive version. See this one if you want to have fun comparing, but don't expect too much. I was even getting bored and I can sit through the 1995 version over and over, and have read the book every year.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I agree with many reviews of this trilogy that I've read.  These books are, without question, cheesy and pretty poorly written.  That being said, they are also addictive.  I read all three over the course of a few days.  I have multiple college degrees and consider myself to be an educated, thinking person.  I really WANTED to dislike these books, but I just couldn't.  Unlike most \\"erotica,\\" the storylines in all three books are pretty engaging.  You really care about the characters and what happens to them.  I can absolutely understand why women are obsessed with these books.  I didn't want to be one of them...but here I am writing a review.  This series doesn't pretend to be something it's not.  And those people who are critical of these books were obviously looking for something in the WRONG place.
B006YCX01O|1.0|Nina Zilli is the best of the best. That said, paying 47 bucks for an album is just outrageous, you're drunk, or what???!!!! I'll just wait for her latest album to be available as MP3 for download at a reasonable price.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Definitely a great read!  Good storyline and thrilling plot, with questions begging to be answered, I have read 6, and can't wait for 7!  I'm very glad he packed these together though, by themselves I have a feeling I would have felt they were to short with to many cliff hangers.  I strongly recommend!
B007JM4CWY|1.0|Application sounds awesome, but app FC at load screen.  Motorola Xoom 4g, with ICS.  fix and I will change review.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is fun and challenging, but not so hard that you can't get it figured out in 5 or 10 minutes. I really like this game!

0345535421|3.0|If anything, this book taught me not to trust Martin's foreshadowing. The end of book one seemed to be at the precipice of some amazing climax, and I wasn't about to argue with an ominous red comet. But 800 pages later, now, finally it seems like there could be some ass kicking on the horizon. Or maybe Martin's just trying to teach us that vengeance is not the answer and war is horrible beyond reason. I can't disagree. It just gets dang depressing.<br /><br />Something horrible is happening on pretty much every page. No more stories about Jon making friends at the wall, or Arya being taught to be a badass sword master. If something good happens the consequences usually result in a net negative. I appreciate what Martin is telling us about humanity in a state of war, but even All Quiet on the Western Front had more lighthearted moments. Even this I could tolerate if the story was held together by some rock of morality like the first book.<br /><br />Another problem I have is the lack of character development. The main characters all seem to develop in slight, predictable ways. Many of them are just playing their roles as determined in the book one. Ultimately it was hard for me to relate to a lot of the characters and I was disappointed whenever their storyline came up. It would also be nice to see some chapters of random characters, no storyline, just check up on what they're thinking. Shae for example. Or Varys.<br /><br />Overall I'm glad I got through it and I'm looking forward to the third book. Martin earned himself more than enough goodwill with the first.
0345803493|5.0|Christian Grey is soo hot!! I wish there were men really like this out there, I would be \\"stalking\\" them like Grey stalks Anastasia.<br /><br />The incredible sex continues but better, yet, is the relationship progresses and we begin to learn of Grey's jaded past. The depth of my lust for Christian grows and my connection with Anastasia continues.<br /><br />If you're on the first book, continue the series!!!
0385339100|4.0|Picked this one purely cause of the great reviews on Amazon. Like always, Grisham gives you a beautiful break from everyday life.<br /><br />Fast paced, realistic portrayals and seriously cool !<br /><br />A fantastic read for someone who justs wants to put their feet up, relax and savor some great entertainment.<br /><br />Read it!
B007CKNX28|5.0|great i love this cd it feels like a classic very noire and bluesy but it still has jack whites roots its a very unique cd expecially if your not use to blues or country if your feeling adventurous and love what jack white does you will love this cd
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This is a challenging and fun puzzle game that can keep you entertained for hours.  The game saves what you do when you exit so you don't have to start over every time.
0393088774|4.0|Highly recommended. Paul Krugman makes economics matter, not least because he understands that \\"there's one economics-driven thing that matters enormously to human well-being: having a job.\\" Clear, compelling and mercifully free of jargon. Like Richard Feynman and the O-ring.
1401235417|4.0|I've always been a Batman fan, and this hardback book combines last year's Batman 1-7 from DC Comics - a nice way to have all issues on hand.<br /><br />Printing and inking is excellent, with additional bonus images and content included in a gallery of alternative covers and script in the back.<br /><br />It's also an economical way to acquire the original content, but perhaps not for collectors.
0670023329|4.0|I thought this book was pretty good... would recommend to other people.  This book makes you appreciate how well people live in developed countries.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I had given up reading Stephen King books about the time of The Green Mile.  So much repitition.  However, this book was so intriguing, that I couldn't resist picking it up.  Read it in just a matter of days!  So excited to read a Stephen King book that didn't inlcude an eclipse or the city of Bangor, Main!  Absolutely a book that makes you think about \\"if I can do it all over again.\\"
B005L38QK2|4.0|This mouse is awesome, the only flaw i see is it is meant to be both left and right handed so u have 2 buttons on the side next to ur ring finger either way u use the mouse but u get used to it fairly quick, this mouse is also well for other games other then diablo 3 i also use it on league of legends
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This installment of GoT was terribly hard to muddle through. The entire book could have been a prologue to an actual, meaty, important novel.<br /><br />A lot of drawn out story and not much action at all.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game and I love the fact it keeps my daughter entertained. I have no problems navigating in or out of the game.
B0037KMHRY|3.0|basic sounds and beats, not really music but a trance like melody that is ok, something to zone out to and maybe play video games and have as background noise
0345803493|5.0|I'm so impressed with this series so far, I bought this immediately after finishing the first book, and it didn't disapoint.  It left off right where Fifty shades of Grey ended, which was nice, I was worried there was going to be a huge gap of time in between the two but it was only a matter of days.<br />Christian and Ana's relationship never ceases to amaze me, they have so many obstacles but their passion and love gets them through it all.<br />I've never read a book with SOOO much Sex/Love making in them!!!! There was more in this one than in the first one.  Some people may think it's crude or dirty, but I've enjoyed ready this storyline, it's interesting and very different from every other book I've read.  I've already ordered the 3rd book and can't wait to start it!  Although I know I'll be sad because it's the last one.  I'll definitley savor it.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|The game itself is great when it works. Similar to Picross and gets challlenging as you progress. Decent number of puzzles too. My problem is that I cannot re-open the game on my Kindle Fire. I just get a black screen and nothing loads. Have re-installed twice now...works for a while and same thing happens. Once this bug is fixed it will be a great game! I am glad I got this as FAoTD rather than paid for it since it doesn't work.

B003BKF696|5.0|This is the type of album that doesn't initially grab you but upon multiple listens you will start to really hear it's nuance. It has a beautiful, thick atmosphere and no shortage of heartbreaking lyrics. I have it on constant rotation. It is my favorite album to wake and retire too. A great album for a scenic drive. The scenery will take on a different meaning...
B007J4T2G8|3.0|First, those who say the book condones abuse, are people who are closed minded to peoples different lifestyles. Not everyone has \\"vanilla sex\\" (as its called in the book.<br /><br />Now....the writing in this book is immature, and repititive. Ana reminds me of a teenager, and I got tired off seeing Holy f***, Jeez, and reading about her biting her lip, his grey eyes, his hair, the pants hanging off the hips, her inner goddess...I can go on and on.<br /><br />The sex scenes seemed kinda ridiculous after the first 2-3. Once again, immature writing and over the top with the orgasms and \\"Oh Ana!\\" Blah.<br /><br />Save your money for something better written.<br /><br />I wish I would've waited before purchasing the second book.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I can't put it down! If you love puzzles , or suduko, or stuff like that, you'll love this! I may have gotten it for free, but I think it's worth it to buy it.
B004CGUC06|5.0|To the degree that Amacord is autobiographical, Fellini accomplished an amazing slight of hand on film. Here we have the exaggerated  reminiscences shown through the eyes of youth - everything is bigger, brighter and more fantastic in memory than it likely was in reality. From the huge breasted woman in the tobacco shop to the unbelievably impressive cruise ship, every scene in Amacord resonates with memories that have grown bigger than life over time. The Italian family that provides some of the best domestic scenes is also exaggerated and stereotyped but at the same time may be the most realistic aspect of this film.<br />The film is absolutely wonderful as a study of capturing the intersection of fantasy and the haze of recollection. Here is ample evidence of Fellini's talent and particular genius. Watch in Italian or you'll miss the inflections that are integral to enjoying this to it's full potential.
0007294662|5.0|There is an American edition of this book, but the cover is ugly and jumbled.  Do yourself a favor and get the UK version.  Simply put, it's the most beautiful and interesting coffee table book I've ever seen.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This series is so great.  Bears watching again and again.  Great writing, great humor, great characters in both Watson and Holmes.  The second season is great too.  When you only produce three episodes per year, you have the time to get it right.<br /><br />The gay innuendo starts wearing a bit thin in the second season, where it seems they're starting to attach more seriousness to it.  Sorry, but that does not add interest for me.  More like one of the writers pushing their own gender agendas.  Or would that be agenders.<br /><br />Regardless, great twist on an old classic.
B004J1DBJI|2.0|app has been having force close issues for previous two updates.  the idea is great but it is far from viable at this point.  please fix &amp; add a way to contact dev from app with issues.  once it works as it used to its an incredibly useful app.
0470876417|2.0|I found that this book was too feel-good and focused on itself. By that I mean that it overuses fancy design. The book itself would be easy to mistake for a book on typography or sketching, and overall has a feel of something created by people enamored of book design rather than really helping people learn. It's very easy to turn through page after page of \\"eye candy\\" and feel entertained. But to actually understand and learn from the book requires intense concentration and willingness -- nay, discipline -- to refuse to be distracted. This makes the book require much more effort to read than I believe it should.<br /><br />Granted, the topics deserve concentration and there is no reward without hard work. These are not easy topics. But why make them harder with slick photos and graphics to distract you?<br /><br />I recommend Ash Maurya's \\"Running Lean\\" instead for serious entrepreneurs.

B005SZAEYO|5.0|This has been the best horror show ever. My daughter barely saw episodes 1 and 5 6 7 and we are about to see who rubber man is. We watch this every night until 11:30. It's addicting, she's always asking when the second season comes on. We love this show and cant wait to see any more. Does anyone know a scary series like this? This is so intresting and my daughter loves Tate! he is so sweet to Violet!
B004WDX5P8|5.0|Loved this movie! Definitely grabs your attention and keeps it until the end.<br />Ryan Reynolds is a great actor.<br />I first saw this movie on Netflix and knew that I had to own it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not usually one to follow the trends...but went ahead and spent the $30 to download the trilogy on my Kindle and honestly feel like I should receive a refund. If a product does not work or does not meet expectations the manufacturer or store will happily issue a credit or refund...well Amazon...may I please have a credit toward something worthwhile reading???  Seriously a terrible read by an author that is a very poor writer.  The topic is fine...but if the author is writing for an adult audience, she should rethink her approach.  So sad and such a waste of my money during this tough economy.  You should save your money or go get something that will really make you feel good...like a manicure and pedicure.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|As an author I like to see other authors become commercially successful. And this author really has. He's tapped into a vein, a need, a hunger that many readers have for excitement in their otherwise routine lives. Forget about the plot or the character development and all that sort of stuff. He's giving the readers what they need. And very few authors do that. For that he deserves my congrats.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0066PQSJA Writer Interruptus and Other Stories]]

B0079J27JW|5.0|These recordings are remakes of works that David Oistrakh recorded for EMI in the 1950's.  EMI had just signed Herbert von Karajan to a new contract after a nine year hiatus, and the opportunity to record him and his Berlin Philharmonic with the Soviet superstars Oistrakh, Richter, and Rostropovich in the Beethoven Triple Concerto was seen as a marketing coup.  The three Soviet artists were at the peak of their popularity in the 1960's.  The only downside is that the Beethoven Triple Concerto is not top-flight Beethoven. It is more entertaining than profound.  Fortunately, the artists  don't try to make more of the work than it can handle.  Everyone appears to be enjoying themselves, and EMI's recording, although a bit opaque and wooly, is perfectly acceptable.<br /><br />The Brahms pieces on this disc are sterner stuff.  Oistrakh had made the Double Concerto with Fournier and Galliera in the 1950's, a recording that still holds up very well.  This remake with Rostropovich and George Szell with the Cleveland Orchestra is as good as this elite grouping of artists would suggest.  This one of the best versions of the Brahms Double Concerto in the catalog.<br /><br />David Oistrakh was born to play the Brahms Violin Concerto.  Although displaying a prodigious technique, it was his ability to sustain a long lyrical line that set Oistrakh apart from other great violinists of his generation.  He plays with great lyrical intensity throughout the work, and he is superbly partnered by George Szell and his Cleveland Orchestra. This would be Oistrakh's third and final studio version of the work, and it would also be one of Szell's last recordings.  George Szell passed away in 1970, and David Oistrakh died in 1974.<br /><br />The sound on this recording is full, bright, with a warm orchestral perspective.<br /><br />The works on this recording are a stunning reminder of the great music that was being made in the Classical Golden Age.

1401235417|4.0|The New 52 in many ways rebooted the DC Universe, but Batman's continuity remained more-or-less intact from the pre-New-52 days.  Dick Grayson is still Nighthawk, Tim Drake is still Red Robin and Damian Wayne is still Robin.  Most importantly, however, Bruce Wayne is Batman, and in Volume 1 of his New 52 title, he has to face an adversary that is new and old at the same time.<br /><br />The seven issues in this volume introduce the Court of the Owls, a secret society that has apparently been in Gotham City for a long, long time, with ties even to Bruce Wayne's great-great grandfather.  The Court has existed in local nursery rhymes and is not known for being a nice group, but the World's Greatest Detective believes they're little more than a myth.<br /><br />Whether they're truly an ancient society or a new one coopting the myth is something that will challenge Batman's investigative skills.  But this is no intellectual exercise; the Court is up to no good and Batman will have to combat their enforcer, the virtually unkillable Talon.  His struggle against the Court will threaten him both physically and mentally.<br /><br />Long-time Batman fans know that he had an evil, alternate universe version of himself known as Owlman, so the Court of the Owl hearkens back to an enemy who is really his polar opposite.  In addition, in nature, owls can prey on bats.  As a result, Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo do a nice job of bringing to life a new Batman foe that is both intriguing and truly dangerous.
0307592731|5.0|I think good memoirs are written like this one--all encompassing and transparent. What an incredible journey. Strayed kept me nestled in, staying up way too late and skipping sleep. Her flashback stories were vivid and were introduced with perfect timing when on the PCT. I commend her for being so brutally honest about her life--the good and the bad.  The Pacific Crest Trail narrative was an eye opening experience for me and she inspired me to give it a try! When I am on my much shorter hiking trip Wild will be on my Kindle for the trip.
0345803507|4.0|If it had not been for the last chapter in the first book I would not have purchased the other 2. I struggled through the first book as I am not a fan of graphic erotic novels nor BDSM in the slightest. However everyone I know is reading these and raving about them. I skimmed the sex parts. I mean honestly who on this planet has sex like that or that often??? Very unrealistic but the character development is amazing and leaves you wanting to know more about everyone involved. I would like to see the Kate and Elliot storyline unfold. Or maybe a book from Taylor's perspective even! I learned a lot reading these books and I am quite fine with my vanilla life.
B007UXTG8M|2.0|Shame is THE definitive sexual addiction film, and Michael Fassbinder's portrait of a sex addict is unlikely to be bettered by another actor any time soon. All that media buzz around him is all true. His performance is one of the more brilliant any of us is likely to see in the movies.  While Carey Mulligan struggles extravagantly to hold her own as his pathologically messed up pain-in-the-ass sister, it remains Michael Fassbinder's picture from first shot through last frame.<br /><br />The essence of sexual addiction is an inability to find satisfaction, those few moments of post-orgasmic repose that allow--however briefly--a fleeting balm of peace with ourselves and a temporary truce with the world to settle around us, and just for right now, for everything to be o.k.  Ay, there's the rub. Shame perfectly captures the relentless, desperate yearning for just a breath or two of minuscule relief, the micro-timeout, that never, ever arrives. Godot has already come and long since blown this scene.<br /><br />There is the possibility that in your life, you've not yet had the occasion to ponder the hell realm of sexual--or of any flavor, for that matter--addiction. In which case, this could be fascinating unknown territory for you to explore. But if you've already experienced a glimpse of absolute despair, there's really no need to sumerge yourself in a 100 minute cinematic buzz-kill that goes absolutely nowhere, no matter how artfully it is rendered.<br /><br />There is also a surfeit of dark New York streets punctuated by the angst of lost subway lust. The neo-noir textures could not feel more authentic.<br /><br />Oh!  Right.  About all the nudity.  Should the mild titillation of semi-soft-core full frontal hold some attraction, this is the wrong place to look for gratification.  Sure, there's plenty of skin and the bodies are all nice enough, but it's 180° opposite from a turn-on. Unless, that is, you are of the more kinked persuasion, say the sort who appreciates a cin&eacute;ma veriti&eacute;-style shot of a buck naked Fassbinder's backside as he pisses into his own toilet without bothering to raise the seat (Yes, his sister is staying in his apartment at the time. Passive-aggressive? You think?), then jiggles the post-penal drip from his dangling dick's famously generous foreskin.  A telling moment, definitely, but for myself, more than I  care to contemplate, given my mental state after macerating my mind in those 100 minutes of Shame.cinéma veritié-style shot of a buck naked Fassbinder's backside as he pisses into his own toilet without bothering to raise the seat (Yes, his sister is staying in his apartment at the time.

0345803485|3.0|This book was a hard read. I am surprised a novel of this caliber is getting so much press like Dr. Oz and Ellen. I would be very surprised if Dr. Oz has even read this book. It was not empowering as the women on the show gushed it would be. It was sad and deviate but did have some funny laugh out loud parts especially the emails back and forth.  If it had not been for the last chapter in the first book I would not have purchased the other 2. I struggled through this book as I am not a fan of graphic erotic novels nor BDSM in the slightest. However everyone I know is reading these and raving about them. I skimmed the sex parts. I mean honestly who on this planet has sex like that or that often??? Very unrealistic but the character development is amazing and leaves you wanting to know more.

B004I1WIWU|3.0|Was very disappointed in the sound quality of the album. Adele is awesome, but the vinyl is not. Album is new and looks beautiful, but sounds warped on a couple songs and the edge was so uneven that the record was dragging because I have an enclosed turntable.

B004EBT5CU|1.0|I was floored by her first album, and still think its one of the best I have ever heard. I quickly bought this album, expecting an even better recording, but was extremely disappointed. There may be 1 good song on the whole CD. She is trying way too hard and sounds really commercialized or country or just crap. Sorry, but I will not rush to buy her next album.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I am a long time Norah Jones fan and have liked some of her past albums and loved some of them as well. This latest fare from her is something quite unexpected in a very good way. This album has been at the top of my playlist since I bought it a week ago. The music is layered and at times complex, yet there is a pop feel in many tracks. The vocals are, well Norah's and to me they sound a little like they did in the Fall.<br />Overall, it's a solid album and much different from her previous work. She has not gone stale. In fact, a few tracks were really surprising. Miriam is beautiful until you listen carefully to the lyrics, then it becomes rather distributing, as it explores the dark depths of an abusive relationship. The tracks on this album are heavy and deserve a repeat hearing.

B007JWKLMO|5.0|I have seen the Beatles in many online videos just prior to and after arriving in the U.S. in 1964. Two things I noted about George: First, he would kind of dance or shuffle his feet to the music as the band played and he was really smiling like he enjoyed the performance every bit as much as the members of the audience. He liked to perform on stage and had fun doing it. Second: After the first appearance on the Ed Sullivan show, the Beatles performed their first concert in the U.S. in Washington D.C. The first number performed in that concert was a solo by George Harrison and his voice was every bit as good as Paul and John. He did a fantastic job. It made me wonder if he did a lot more lead singing prior to the Beatles coming to the U.S. and then the group decided to record and perform only the songs that they wrote after they released their second album. The only song I remember them performing that they did't write after that time was John's occasional \\"Twist and Shout\\" and just maybe \\"Please Mister Postman.\\" George was an outstanding performer that just seemed overshadowed by John and Paul who were also outstanding performers, but since John and Paul wrote almost all of the songs, they did most of the singing. George was indeed special.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|When I downloaded this game I had my doubts after reading some of the User comments but after I read a comment stating &quot;this game is pretty much just a remake of the old classic game Super Mario&quot; I downloaded it instantly...To my surprise, it was just like Super Mario, I love this game...
0307950689|1.0|I've read and enjoyed every Dan Brown novel, and was excited to finally have something new!<br /><br />Wow, was I in for a surprise...<br /><br />It seemed Brown threw this piece of monkey dung together just to see if people would buy anything he writes. I actually found myself laughing out loud at the holes in the plot, the voices of the characters, the dialogue, EVERYTHING! The biggest twist was that the book was so terrible compared to his others, which I found smart and fun, if a bit on the easy-reading side.<br /><br />When Dan Brown publishes another, I'll be sure to borrow it from my library first.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|I loved the series and wnted to buy the book but when i was scrolling through the reviews, about 50% (or more) have complained about their kindles and ereaders crashing. i am waiting for a version where it is fixed and wont crash to come out, because i do not want to get the hard book copy.
1401203078|3.0|There's a lot of history in the book. The story itself is short. Very basic Alan Moore, except when you need the 3d glasses, which i like despite how awkward they are to wear. All in all, it's okay. Not worth 15-20 bucks, but worth some of your time.
B0083EW97W|5.0|Born and Raised has it all.  Give it a few reprises and you will be hooked.  John Mayer is, undeniably, a writer of excellence.  The trick is to match the music with the lyric and convey it all through the vocals.  Check.  This seems to be a highly personal work, born of a life that continues to evolve.  There is much that can be related to and it flows beautifully.  You will find the music filling your head with sound and will love every moment of it.  The only painful part is the hope that Mayer's vocal issues will resolve so that we may savor future works.  Treasure this if you love the lyric as much as the music and the perfect meeting of both expressed through the artist's vocals.
0345803485|1.0|I don't know about anybody else, but when it comes to my fantasies controlling, creepy, clingy, and abusive pedobear stalkers need not apply. And that means YOU, Christian Grey!<br /><br />Who knows why, but I finally broke down and read this terrible book. Maybe I'm just a glutton for punishment. But if I'm going to hate on something for the attention it's getting and the fact that I literally can't go ONE DAY without hearing about it no matter how hard I try to avoid it, the least I can do is give it an honest shot. At least I can now rightfully state my opinion that it's a *complete* travesty to literature. This is exactly how you define \\"utter garbage\\"; this \\"writer\\" (if she can even call herself that) is a disgrace to the craft, and much like Meyer she borrows from way better novels without injecting any decent form of originality. I'll watch Dexter if I want to focus on a character with dead mommy issues, k thx. At least he just kills people that deserve it instead of stalking and sexually abusing some stupidly compliant twit that I kinda wish he actually WOULD HAVE killed--woulda made it more interesting at least.<br /><br />Maybe I'm a little screwed up myself to keep on reading to see what the point of this was. But I'm obviously not as screwed up as this cast. I didn't think it could get any worse than Twilight, but of course its spawn from the bowels of the fan fiction universe would prove me wrong. I wish negative stars were possible. I'm not a prude, but it makes me wonder about and weep for what society has come to a little bit. This book has absolutely no redeeming qualities aside from it *finally* ending, and I really couldn't care less happens next, at least not enough to spend hours reading it. I can read the highlights and really not miss much. They could both die horrible deaths and I'd just think the world was a better place for it. One less idiot; one less sicko bastard. Maybe I can just write a fanfic about that and Warner Bros. will contract me for a movie on it since piggybacking is obviously \\"in\\" now and the masses eat it up.<br /><br />I certainly have my share of flawed billionaire book crushes (cue Trent Kalamack and Jericho Barrons), but Christian Grey is as far as you can get from making my list. At least they have actual goals and a purpose. And, more importantly, their love interests wouldn't be on the business end of their transgressions while IN the actual relationship. Christian Grey's psychological profile reminds me more of Christian Bale in American Psycho. This dude is just a creeper, plain and simple. If he weren't so \\"beautiful\\" on the outside like we have to hear about ad nauseam OR rich, I bet we'd actually see Ana make a smart decision as she gets a clue. The devil was the most beautiful angel after all.<br /><br />And I must have missed the memo where this is supposed to be hott. It didn't get my motor running and it didn't help that these characters are so damned unlikeable. I'm not big on erotica, but I've read many books with explicit sex scenes and some actually manage to be pretty hott, so for this book it HAS to be the terrible writing that leaves me cold and repulsed. I may have a permanent WTF look etched on my face because that's all I could muster while reading this inane POS for who knows how many hours.<br /><br />Not to mention, to me it's suggesting that to be into that lifestyle you have to have some sort of screwed up issues that manifest during childhood. I'd be insulted if that were my thing. I'm a proponent of doing whatever floats your boat, but this was just badly executed in every which way.<br /><br />I was sick of hearing about her terribly cheesy \\"inner goddess\\". I was sick of her stupid lip biting. I was sick of his head cocking. Being written in first person was probably the worst thing to happen to this book. She's got the type of mentality of those stupid girls that run off and end up missing, probably due to blindly following some crazy dude like this.It's not much different to me than a kid being abused trying to convince himself that he believes it's okay and that he wants it. She may be an adult, but mental maturity is relative. And believe me, there's very little that comes out of her mouth that sounds mature.<br /><br />As for a story? As if there's no other book out there with an angsty storyline that you don't have to TRY to find between all of this sick crap? All in all, I wish I got these hours of my life back and I anxiously await the day that this fad passes by like everything else NOT worthy of the attention it gets in modern pop culture.<br /><br />Sex sells. So this is really just an excuse to put porn on the shelves...with a warped but uninventive fairytale thrown in for kicks.<br /><br />As I said, I'm a glutton for punishment. It's my own damn fault, but unlike Twilight where I read all 4 trying to figure out what the big deal was, I promise this is as far as I'm going with this one.It's not much different to me than a kid being abused trying to convince himself that he believes it's okay and that he wants it.

B004XJRQUQ|2.0|Hindsight being twenty twenty...I should have stopped with book one...I would have walked way satisfied. Book one is a fresh concept. Although written for teens,  it contains a lot of violence. A love story laced with intense drama and character rich. Book 2 kept my  interest but ultimately let me down after a great book 1. Book three was a struggle to finish and left me with a sense of releif that it is finally over.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|I ordered this because I wanted something very sleek and slim to cover and protect my kindle fire for general usage.  This is the smallest profile case I could find.  It's very lightweight and barely increases the size of the case.  The outside is a rubbery material that's slicker than I thought it would be (I wanted rubber over leather for better grip on surfaces).  The inside cover is a nice soft velvet--good for the screen.  The inside of the back is just a hard plastic material that covers the entire back and about 75% of the sides of the device.  This thin layer may help to reflect some fall damage, but not a ton.  I will say that the case looks fantastic.  The elastic strap is great so far, but not convinced it's going to hold up in the long run.  The stand feature works OK.  It's not great, but it's certainly not as terrible as other reviewers have suggested.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line.  This case will provide some protection while virtually adding no weight or size to the device.  I personally think it looks very professional and modern.  However, at the ridiculously high price they are asking for it, I had to dock a star.  This is a great case for what it is, but there's no way it's worth 30$.  Maybe half that.  If I had spent 15-20$ I would be absolutely thrilled.

B0060N9868|5.0|I saw this artist on Conan not too long ago and was kind of blown away by his performance.  Most of the musical guests do well on Conan, but they have this big band behind them and they make lots of noise.  This guy just played his guitar and sang and...well, I came right here and bought his EP. I don't tend to do that much.<br /><br />I am completely captivated it.  The lyrics are mostly well-crafted as is the music.  He has a way of saying a lot with very little.  These songs are thoughtful, sweet, sexy and soothing all at once.  He has a clean, deep tone that has a little growing to do, but his voice is still pretty awesome.<br /><br />Oh, and he's, like, twenty.<br /><br />I am addicted and I can't wait for a full American album release.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|The icons mean next to nothing to me.  It really isn't a great interface.  It is hard to figure out how to annotate, and the annotation options are limited.  Especially on a small screen.  But, it flows documents really, really well.

Die once and start over.  I can't even imagine the hard level.
B0000247D1|1.0|This is a perfect example of why you, the Amazon customer, should take laudatory enthusiasms for favorite performers in any venue with about as many grains of salt as Morton piles up every week.<br /><br />Good grief! What unbelieveable slack conducting! Is this the first example on record of a conductor beset with locked-in syndrome? Poor Wand seems utterly incapable of getting the orchestra to phrase even the simplest section - lines simply pass by without the slightest curve or rise, impulse or sign of life. It's like the conductor died and the featherbedding fireman, having been forced out, is not there to step in - the landscape passes and the train just keeps rolling along down the rails. How such a performance possibly could be released defies any qualitative judgment. Listening to the first movement calls up adjectives like slack, listless, dumb, impotent. The Romantic Symphony? I have this image of poor Wand, staring off into space while the orchestra members look back and forth at each other, wondering if he's ever going to give any sign of life whatsoever. \\"Should maybe one of us call out, 'Yoo-hoo! G&uuml;nter?' and hope he snaps out of it?\\" But apparently decorum - not to mention German discipline - ruled, and nobody broke etiquette. (Which causes one to wonder just what it would take to stop a performance and lead the latest in a long line of hapless octogenarian conductors who overstayed their time off to a much needed oxygen tent.) Because that's what it sounds where we're headed as we listen to a first movement playing on and on without any sign suggesting a conductor's administration of inflection or point.<br /><br />After the first movement, which goes down in my book as the most unconnected work by a conductor in recent history, any humane producer caring for Wand's reputation would have mercifully turned off the recording machinery and junked it all. \\"Sorry, G&uuml;nter, a power surge knocked out the instruments...or maybe some fifteen syllable engineering term meaning 'we found the studio's head's Siamese cat hair was buggering the bi-amp's internals.' Whatever saves face for all. But, no.<br /><br />This live event - and I use the word 'live' merely to reflect the chronological and public nature, not whether or not an actual discernible heartbeat exists in such a state of quietus - is derived from three different performances. This leads me to wonder: If these are the best movements taken from the three concerts, what did the worst sound like?<br /><br />To sum up - avoid it! And in future I will NEVER trust any reviewer who had ANYTHING good to say about this recording - the polar opposite of the dithyrambic approach this triumphant and exciting work requires.ring term meaning 'we found the studio's head's Siamese cat hair was buggering the bi-amp's internals.'

B000FC10QG|3.0|The story here is interesting and has plenty of larger-than-life characters who are tied up in multiple interlocking conflicts of their own making.  However, the writing doesn't clarify the complications of the story as well as it should.  In addition, the frequency of incorrect word choice (e.g. \\"he was _issued_ out of the room\\") is high enough to be quite distracting and should have been caught by the editor(s).<br /><br />Read it if you're interested in the individuals in the book or in the world of LBO's in the late 1980's to early 1990's.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.

B002PL5GTC|2.0|this album reminds me of the reason that i avoid greatest hits releases.  they tend to lack cohesion.  an original album represents a work of art like a painting.  taking pieces of several paintings to create a new painting poses a challenge for creating a cohesive new art form.  this one doesn't work for me.<br /><br />worse that the cohesiveness is the sound of the vinyl version of this recording.  i only own the vinyl recording.  it sounds like crap. noisy. distorted. poorly mastered.  i don't understand how artists or recording engineers can listen to this and then decide that it sounds acceptable for public consumption.  it doesn't. it sucks.  what a waste of money.  i find it unbearable.  it screeches.  sound is congested. don't buy the the vinyl.  not sure how the cd sounds.  i suppose if you don't own other foo fighters albums then perhaps buying the greatest hits may make sense.  perhaps.  i doubt it.  be joy.

B007L96SI6|5.0|Haley Reinhart, my fave contestant on Idol season 10...she finished 3rd and highest of those NOT country (winner Scotty McCreery and runnerup Lauren Alaina)...released her anticipated debut \\"Listen Up!!\\", and after a year, oh boy, is it worth the wait!!  She's been a fave from the beginning when no one knew what to make of her, she kept getting trashed, and regularly made the bottom 3...I loved that Haley has always been a HYBRID artist, one that mixed soul and rock, or pop and whatever, and I remember the judges always had a problem with that...are you pop or soul??  Are you rock or pop??  Uh judges, what about both???  I KNEW, based on her musical family, that she had mega talent and she's always been a songwriter and had great influences and taste, and KNEW her debut, whenever it drops, would be special...and I was right and feel 100% vindicated by my faith in her gifts...Haley delivered and then some!!<br /><br />All 10 tracks on the regular edition are gems, but the 4 bonus tracks are notable too, in that they flesh out Haley's range in more styles...2 of them being more rock-ish.  What's also great is that Jimmy Iovine, Idol mentor & Interscope prez, believes in songwriters (not Clive Davis over at Sony, Idol's prior home), and knew Haley had that talent and wanted that to be front and center...including the bonus cuts, Haley wrote/co-wrote 13 of the 14 tunes, and all are strong, amazing, and so's the sequence...it flows like a solid album rather than a few strong singles and a bunch of filler.  The only downfall to this is that not one song stands out above others screaming \\"SINGLE, pick me!!\\"...but to be honest, that's a good problem to have, haha.<br /><br />Even better is the style of the album overall...a refreshingly retro (but modern-friendly) 60s girlpop sound, with jazzy flourishes, and danceable beats and a dollop of rocker grit and take no crap attitude...it's sunny in mood and perfect for the spring and summer months, playing at beach or pool parties, barbecues, and in the car with the top and windows down, speeding down the highway...a real FEEL GOOD album.  There is also a warmth to the production and songs that are perfect for VINYL...something cool, collectible and cultish about Haley and this record that I can see Jimmy and 19/Interscope releasing it as a beautiful gatefold LP...the fun 60s-evoking cover and artwork plays into the album's mood & retro feel as well...plus her cheeky humour with the kids, the pool, the playful goddess-posing, the swimsuits that show her assets in sexy, fun, and tasteful ways...like 60s glamour magazines, movies and TV shows.  I have a strong feeling that the Brits would take to this platter more than American radio pop fans...it resembles Brit-soul and pop artists like Saint Etienne, Swing Out Sister, Girls Aloud, the upbeat side of Adele & Amy Winehouse, and that plays into my taste like a glove...I feel I need to send a copy of this record to Bob Stanley & Peter Wiggs from Saint Etienne because it's in their taste...they raved over this band called The School, an LA band who's 2009 release \\"Loveless Unbeliever\\" was released on some tiny Spanish indie label, and is in the same vein as Haley's debut here.  They would eat it up...so would Saint Etienne singer Sarah Cracknell...Haley is like their American kindred spirit, really!!<br /><br />Like I said, the songs are all gems, even the opener \\"Oh My\\" with B.o.B.'s rap, which could have been a current trend pandering move and misstep, but like Austin Powers, straddling the 60s and today, it works, he only gets 1 verse towards the end anyway.  The one non-Haley-written tune, \\"Free\\", by her producer busbee, not an outside hack like Bruno Mars or Diane Warren, thank goodness, is a great song as well, with a great chorus, hooks and non-formulaic style, which fits into the album like a glove.  \\"Liar\\" is a killer tune with growly jazzy flourishes in Haley's attack...\\"Wasted Tears\\" is a delightful danceable stomper...\\"Undone\\" is amoving dramatic cut...\\"Now That You're Here\\" is catchy and girlgroupish, \\"Wonderland\\" a great pop song, \\"Keep Coming Back\\" ditto, \\"Hit The Ground Runnin'\\" like both the Supremes and Girls Aloud, amazing...\\"Walking On Heaven\\" a nice end to the regular album...with the bonus cuts, \\"Follow Me (I'm Right Behind You)\\" adds rockish grit to the album, which is missing from the regular edition and it's awesome...\\"Spiderweb\\" is more like an offkilter modern rock ballad, really cool and great melodic chorus...\\"What You Don't Know\\" is another girlgroupish gem...and the final cut \\"Let's Run Away\\" is different...a dollop of reggae and fuelled by both ukelele and mandolin, finishing the album on a sunny, island vacation kind of mood, like the album is a step-by-step escape, and you finally reached your vacation destination, but what a trip!!  Oh yeah, her talented guitarist dad is all over the album too...what a family!!<br /><br />This is one vacation you want to take over and over, with Haley as your fun, happy, sexy tourguide.<br /><br />Amazing!!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Some people don't like the ending of this book. I guess what they wanted to read was a fairytale. What this book is able to accomplish is to present to us how our losses affect us, how it changes us. But what I really like about it is how despite everything, we can still find our way back to healing. We can still find our dandelion in the spring.[[ASIN:B003XF1XOQ Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]
B005LAIHQ8|3.0|The humor in Men in Black 3 feels really forced early on. Maybe it's outdated or maybe this concept has run its course, but everything fell flat with the entire theater in the first thirty minutes or so. The special effects looked off at times, too. They progressively got better, but looked kind of sketchy during the prison break sequence. If the budget for a film is $215 million, a green screen effect shouldn't be so noticeable or knock you out of the adventure because of its lackluster quality.<br /><br />Everything starts looking up once J takes the time jump, which is odd since it involves his character going down. Suddenly, the supporting cast becomes extremely memorable (Will Arnett as J's new partner, Emma Thompson as Agent O, Bill Hader as Andy Warhol) and the writing gets much tighter. What helps quite a bit is Josh Brolin's incredible Tommy Lee Jones impression. It's subtle yet spot-on. The drawl is there, the facial expressions (or lack thereof), and pronunciations. You can tell that Brolin put a lot of time perfecting his craft.<br /><br />The second half of the movie is the half they were writing on the spot. These were the lines that were being written moments before the actors said them on camera. The odd thing is this is the stronger half of the movie. Michael Stuhlbarg's Griffin character is one of the shining moments of the film. Griffin is able to see every future that could possibly happen (along with the past), but is never quite sure which future is actually going to occur until moments before it happens. His personality along with his enthusiasm has him steal the show at every turn.<br /><br />Rick Baker is the other highlight. He created so many aliens and creatures for this movie. Once the sequel gets going, it's visually very appealing and Rick Baker is one of the essential reasons for that. These aliens are just a wide variety of bizarre, vibrant, and hideously fascinating. Baker more than outdid himself.<br /><br />Despite a rough and rocky start, \\"Men In Black 3\\" is still decent. It's mostly due to the likes of Josh Brolin and Michael Stuhlbarg's fantastic performances along with Rick Baker's exceptionally creative creature designs, but the ending packs an emotional punch. \\"Men in Black 3\\" feels like the type of sequel that isn't completely necessary and doesn't really offer anything new, but is still a nice addition for fans of a beloved franchise.ky start, \\"Men In Black 3\\" is still decent.

It took me on such an emotional rollercoaster I found myself distracted at work because I couldn't resist knowing what would possibly happen next... I look so forward to books including Abby and Travis in the future, you've definitely made a long term fan!!!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I watch a lot of movies and have for many, many years. This is the first movie in a long time that I would tell folks is a must see. I grew up in the Marvel universe, buying the number one issues of Spiderman, Fantastic Four, Thor, etc as they came out and many issues thereafter. This movie does the Marvel characters involved justice. Well done.

B0086700CM|3.0|I have this app on my ipod and I will have to say that the game is much easier to play on it than it is my kindle fire. it may have a little to do with the size of a tablet vs the size of my ipod ( much easier to tilt with one hand because of the size of the device). anyway the actual game could use some improvements,  but not bad at all considering that it has only been available for a short time.  the graphics get a little fuzzy and the screen freezes from time to time,  but nothing terrible.
0439023513|3.0|Suzanne Collins' book \\"Mockingjay\\", third novel in her series of \\"The Hunger Games\\" needs a sequel to resolve everything left up in the air by the author.  I only found a secondhand copy of the first book as the movie came out and read it to see what the excitement was about.  (Finishing \\"The Hunger Games\\" I felt that making a film of a story preaching against voyeuristic violence made no sense, only dollars, but ~Hollywood Uber Alles.)<br /><br />Wanting to see how Collins' resolved the tale, I found the second and third books and just finished the series.  The first two books 'work', being complex, revealing and propulsive -but the third novel fails utterly to carry through with the promise of the characters and storylines she spent so much time and effort developing. It's as if (to give her more of a metaphor than she deserves) Beethoven finished his 9th Symphony NOT with \\"The Ode To Joy\\" but \\"chopsticks\\".  All of this work with a firecracker instead of a supernova?<br /><br />Maybe Collins lost steam, or focus or interest,  -or just failed to appreciate what she had set up and where it would logically and symbolically lead.  Katniss is Bodaecia, Spartacus and, even more, she is Joan of Arc.  Imprisoned by Machiavellian forces who she brought to power.<br /><br />Where was her trial (other than the 'trials' in the \\"arena\\")?<br /><br />Where is Collins' impassioned defense of here heroine?  Her explanation to the citizens for her reverse-rebellion?  Her deepest meaning?  Her heart?  Her plea for a more human structure for her world (told in simple words but great depth)?  She was in the position of Socrates before his accusers, and the books should be rallied at the end to her defense.  Instead she is shuffled offstage like a prop that her served it purpose but is now of no more interest to the playwright.<br /><br />The tale leads up to a potent clash of cultures, wills, moralities, and is poised to examine the nature of evil and love, but peters out and turns into a \\"quick, take a bow and exit the stage\\" denouement that felt as if the last third of the book suddenly seemed too daunting to Collins, so she took her outline notes, threw in a few adjectives, and swiftly sewed up the book in an  unsatisfying \\"and so they went away and lived and had children, THE END\\" type of rush job that does not honor the story which she built up for a crescendo but finished with a fizzle.<br /><br />I think I have to write an unauthorized concluding book for Collins' series, now, to do justice to the characters she abandoned.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I am very impressed with this CPU. \\"Slick\\" is the word that comes to mind. THe stuff on paper about the native PCIe rev.3, and the new memory control circuit....etc. It looks good on paper. \\"These numbers are better than those numbers, this is different than that....\\" Well I put one of these into my computer...the one I use everyday, and haven't really upgraded for a while. I build i7s and Xeons, opterons, and Phenoms.......everyday. I get them to work, feed them an OS, drivers, applications, burn them in, package them and ship them out. I never really do 'my' work on them. (kinda like the shoemakers kids). I went back and forth between the i7s, the 2011 socket....but since this had been a bare bones bullet proof unit, I decided to go with the i5....something that would do what I needed it to do, and NEVER fail.<br /><br />So I put this into an AsRock Extreme 4. Put my old hardware in there. Moved the drives over, loaded the drivers, and fired it up. Holy $^%t! All of that stuff on paper...forget it. What a kick. Real SATAIII is way faster than a SATAIII card. The graphics....wow! I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. This is a total computing experience. Again, I build cutting edge stuff for a living. So I'm kind of numb to this type of stuff. But when it was MY desktop flying around like that (Upgrade was from a core 2 quad).......I was an end user again, and a very happy one at that.<br /><br />(just one tech note: You have to have a z77 or better southbridge to make all the newer stuff on the gen. 3 Intels to work)

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I went with the HYPE and got this book because a couple of co-workers were reading it and I thought it would be great to have a book in common to discuss.<br /><br />Yikes!  WRONG!<br /><br />This book is so BORRR-RINNNGGG!  Talk about a snooze fest!  I felt like I was reading a fake diary of some desperate teenage girl's thoughts on relationships/sex. Or like I was being thrown into the pathetic over-active mind of an overly-excited teenage boy. It's so far fetched, immature, and I am having a hard time getting through the 2nd half of this book.  I cannot believe that there are 2 more books to follow this one.  How do these people get published?  Mind-blowing!<br /><br />It feels like I am reading a Harliquin romance novel gone wrong!  There is nothing hot, sexy, or interesting about this fantasy-filled.  If you read this book...you will understand exactly what I am talking about.
B007O4XX6S|3.0|I was looking forward to this album for a number of reasons; Jeff Lynne's production, Ringo Starr, and I've been waiting for a new Joe Walsh solo record for 20 years... but, this album was a disappointing in a number of ways.<br /><br />There are some great songs on here. Lucky That Way, The Band Played On and Spanish Dancer are among my personal favorites (your results may vary), but this record sounds so bad it could've been recorded by Eddie Kramer. It's plagued with overload distortion and really bad mixes. In fact, the opening guitars of Analog Man are clipping, and ironically, not in a good analog way. It sounds like Pro Tools ran out of headroom and we're hearing complete digital distortion. India is another song that is covered in overload distortion.<br /><br />And cranky audiophiles who don't like compression should stay away. I love the sound of compression, especially in rock music, but there comes a point where it makes things sound smaller, and I think they've hit the saturation point on this album. It makes the album sound pretty lifeless and listening to it wears you out.<br /><br />Then there's the inconstant tonality of the songs. The job of a mastering engineer is to make the album sound like a unified collection of music, but each song here sounds radically different. Analog Man is so mushy and lacking in clarity, while Lucky That Way is so hyped in the top and bottom end that it has has a distinct lack of midrange fullness, and that's followed by Spanish Dancer, a song recorded and mixed by Jeff Lynne, so the defining sound is the midrange heavy mix. Funny enough, there are two mastering engineers credited for this lack of consistency. Too many cooks, perhaps? I haven't heard such ineffective mastering since listening to a Steve Hoffman flat transfer.<br /><br />As for the music, Joe sounds as good as ever. There *are* great songs here (some were mentioned earlier in my review), and as can be expected, there are some real stinkers like the lame-o drum machine driven Funk 50. I doubt any of these songs will become Walsh classics like Rocky Mountain Way or Life's Been Good, but this collection of music is certainly better than his last couple of albums.<br /><br />And finally, I bought this on vinyl. It came with a hi-res 24/96 digital download which I thought was very cool. I hope this is a new trend with vinyl. I'm tired of getting useless 320kbps MP3 downloads. There's no reason all downloads can't be at least 16 bit nowadays. Anyway, getting back to the vinyl, both sides of my LP were pressed off center and it had more surface noise than I'd expect from a new record. Even after I cleaned it on my VPI 16.5 there was still a constant background of Rice Krispies(tm). This poor quality makes me assume it was pressed at United Record Pressing in Nashville.<br /><br />Even though I'm slightly underwhelmed, it's great that Joe Walsh finally released a new solo album. Nevertheless, I'm going to put Analog Man on the shelf and play Barnstorm a couple of times.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was a very well written book. Really drew you into the story, wanting to read the other books. Loved it.
0756407125|4.0|The beauty continues in book two of the Kingkiller Chronicles.  It's slow and detail-oriented storytelling is interspersed with bursts of action and heated moments.  I see some people thought certain areas were too long (time with Felurian and time in Ademre) but I disgree.  You need to know how much those vignettes changed Kvothe and you need the full details to realize the depth of how they helped shape him.  I anxiously await book 3.
0307716546|5.0|Afterwards by Rosamund Lupton is a novel that is part drama, part thriller, and altogether fantastic! It is full of twists and turns galore and has you guessing until the very end. The novel opens with a catastrophic fire at the private school that Grace's eight year old son Adam goes to. It happens that the day of the fire is a special sports day so the school is supposed to be empty but it isn't. Grace's seventeen year old daughter Jenny, there in her capacity as a nurse for the day, is caught in the building. Grace, not thinking for her own safety, rushes in to find her.<br /><br />Thus begins the story...Grace awakens to find herself in the hospital but soon learns that she is caught in the in-between world along with her daughter Jenny able to watch and listen in on everything around them. Both are critically hurt and they learn that the fire is being classified as arson. The story is told by Grace as if she's talking to her husband which at first is hard to follow but after the first few chapters I didn't have any trouble at all. As her husband Mike sits by her bed talking to Grace she reminisces about the past and about what they need to do for their daughter. Jenny desperately tries to remember what exactly happened in the moments before the fire but her memory is blocked. As the mystery unfolds it becomes more and more clear that someone had been trying to kill Jenny. It's a race against time to find out who before they strike again!<br /><br />As the story evolves we put together more and more pieces of the puzzle. Grace's sister-in-law Sarah is a police officer and while they had never been close in life Grace realizes now that she had been wrong about Sarah. Sarah will do anything to protect her brother Mike's family, including Grace. What both Grace and Jenny learn is that the very people they had liked and trusted were maybe the ones they should have been watching more closely. It again brings to the forefront that people aren't always what they seem and what may seem like the perfect family isn't.<br /><br />I've really seen some mixed reviews on this novel and I guess that's what makes us all different in our likes and dislikes in reading. For me this was an amazing novel and I loved it. I connected with Grace's family and the pain that they felt over what was going on. I liked Grace for the fact that she was willing to give up everything for her daughter. Her love for her shone through the pages. I also loved the whole mystery aspect of the story and I think the way Rosamund Lupton tells the story by having it narrated by Grace from the afterward life was very creative and intriguing. At times I was on the edge of my seat waiting for what was next and at others I was shedding a tear or two.<br /><br />What I ultimately took away from this novel was to cherish each day and appreciate it. What may seem irritating to you now or too much trouble could be something that you would love to have the chance at in the future. We just never know what the future can bring us. Love each day and tell those around you how much they mean to you!nd what may seem like the perfect family isn't.<br /><br />I've really seen some mixed reviews on this novel and I guess that's what makes us all different in our likes and dislikes in reading.

The problem is another one follows right after. And Anna  needs to get some balls. You are not his child you are his wife. I know it is fiction but it became so infuriating to watch her loose herself.  I can't wait to finish the book and that is not a good thing. I usually hate when the book is over.

B0007GADZO|5.0|I've been a fan of Steve Vai's since he played for Alcatrazz, I just didn't know it then.  Only when David Lee Roth introduced us properly did I really begin following this guy...  But that gives you an idea of my age, doesn't it?<br /><br />First, and most importantly:  I am not a guitar player.<br /><br />Second, and also important:  I am female.<br /><br />Those two facts alone put me in the rare elite of SSV's fan base.  Now that we've established where I'm coming from when I say ths, let me tell you about Real Illusions: Reflections.  Well, it's really hard to because my first instinct is to just type a lot of emoticons and hyperbole, kinda' like when I reviewed \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" back in the day.  But I shall try...<br /><br />Are you by any chance a fan of Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts?  Then buy this, sight unseen.  Just trust me.<br /><br />This is an incredible, elaborate, sophisticated, insane, complex, intense, layered, freakin masterpiece.  To anyone who thinks Steve Vai is \\"just\\" a guitarist, this will be one gigantic pile of crow to eat.  To those of us who think of him more as Frank Zappa's greatest protege and one of the most underrated composers in history, it will be unsurprising but jaw-droppingly amazing nonetheless.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way.  Stevie can sing.  Put a couple of these songs on headphones, and... well...  I'll rein in the girly stuff, but...  Um. Yeah.  That Long Island boy is something else.<br /><br />I'm not gonna' give you some track by track breakdown here.  You can listen to snips of them above.  But dang, I love when this guy gets experimental and playful.  It's FABULOUS on headphones.  Or any other way really.  If I had to categorize it (VERY difficult) I'd say prog-rock concept album.  Who'd'a thunk?

I don't want to give away any spoilers, and if you've made it through #1 and #2, I know you won't even question getting this one! It just wasn't as addicting...

B0002BO05S|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a very long time, besides the Ten Commandments and the book of John. If you buy this DvD you will NOT be dissapointed Max von Sydow is one great actor and his portrayl of Jesus was MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!! OH, and I also own this movie and watch it a lot. awsome awsome movies!!! but remember when you want to know true facts about the Holy Bible please read the Bible, remember folks this is a movie. but close to scripture.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for bringing to us Biblical movies we can watch instead of the BAD stuff they have on tv these days.<br /><br />GOD BLESS ALL!
1442346949|5.0|The book and the audio CD are highly recommended. Rarely have I read a biography that is hard to put down, this one was an exception, thanks to Walter Isaacson, a truly gifted writer. After reading the book I ordered the audio CD for my son since he was at Disney when Jobs and Pixar released Toy Story. He too agreed that Steve Jobs is a well written, honest biography of one of the great innovators of our time.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I love Star Wars and this box set but very disappointed with what I discovers about it today. My mom bought this on May 4th, national star wars day, and got it for my birthday on May 19th. I am just now starting to watch all these on blu ray and got through the first two but than noticed that the disc menu for three was actually The Phantom Menace. After further inspection it appeared to be that they gave me two copies of Phanton and didn't include Revenge of the Sith. I plan on returning it and getting a copy that has all 6 of the movies but did anyone else have this problem?

0670023329|3.0|The overall story was great however, stylistically this book could have been written much better.  At certain times in the book it felt the the author had Attention Deficit Disorder as he went from one subject to another subject and then to a 3rd totally unrelated subject numerous times.  I'm not sure if this was becuase there was issue in translating the interviews that were held with Shin(The main character)or if the author purposly wrote the book in this manner.  Another issue I had was that the book could have probably been 30-50 pages shorter.  At times the author repeats storiees that were mentioned in the begining of the book.  I typically have no issue if an author foreshadows a story in the begining of a book and then elaborates later in the book but the stories were only elaborated on with one or two sentences and then more ADD actions.  Liek I said overall the book could have been great if the author had a better style of writing.
B0025X4PL0|5.0|FRAMES is simply phenomenal. I revisited this masterpiece today for the first time in awhile, and by a couple minutes into track one, decided I needed to add my glowing praises to its page on Amazon. I'm appalled to see only five others have commented so far, and can only hope this is in part because of the long (~18 month) and unfortunate delay between the original Fall 2007 release of FRAMES and its stateside availability.  To cut to the chase, FRAMES represents the peak of Oceansize's stunningly dense and brilliant career that spanned the years 2002-2010. Their previous two LPs were also undeniably five-star efforts, but this one is the most consistent and hard-hitting of them all. Those earlier records each contained multiple tracks which might contend for the title of all-time best OC song, yet they also faltered -- if only briefly -- with material just a peg or two short of the perfection they're capable of in their best form. FRAMES, on the other hand, doesn't miss a beat.  This is one of those rare discs I found myself jamming exclusively not for a mere week or two after release, but rather for MONTHS. My choice of favorite song cycled through all seven non-instrumentals, each time accompanied by the realization that I'd missed the best nuances on a track I'd previously found a tad lacking. It's also the most cohesive Oceansize record, rewarding an uninterrupted front-to-back listen every bit as much as DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. The way it communicates such a specific, palpable mood and atmosphere, while remaining dynamic enough to weave in both &#34;Savant&#34; and &#34;Sleeping Dogs,&#34; is nearly unparalleled in modern rock. As an avid fan of rock music spanning various sub-genres, I don't take saying this lightly: FRAMES is perhaps my favorite album of all time, and certainly in the top 5.  4.9 stars

B003E6K1VK|5.0|Nice packaging.  Reminds me of how apple packages their stuff.<br /><br />Comes with a \\"condom\\" style case.<br /><br />Comes with a rubber band to strap it to the back of your mp3 player, and a very short 90 degree cable to connect between them.  Very handy.<br /><br />Awesome oled screen with great contrast.  Fairly easy to use menu system.<br /><br />Sound quality is awesome.  Paired these up with my ATH-M50's and they sounded great.<br /><br />Unlike some other fiio models, this one you can actually use while it's charging.<br /><br />For the price, you won't find anything remotely close to this.<br /><br />NOTE: since this has a DAC built in, this is best used for computers. (laptop or desktop via usb cable)  you CAN use it for an ipod or whatnot but that defeats the point of paying extra for a model with a dac built in.  fiio sells straight amplifiers if that's all you need.

0439023513|4.0|Book Title: Mockingjay<br />Author: Suzanne Collins<br />Number of Pages: 390<br /><br />  In the book Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins, the main character Katniss Everdeen has just been taken out of the arena when she finds out that she has been chosen to be the Mockingjay. The Mockingjay is the person who will be the leader of the \\"rebel\\" side to take action in overthrowing the despicable Capital.<br />  Thankful to be alive and in one piece, Katniss is very unhappy. Peeta has been captured by the Capital and will be tortured if he is not saced. Almost everyone from District 12 (Katniss's home district) is dead. Those who managed to escape have been relocated to the mysterious District 13.<br />  This book is similar to other stories/books I have read, such as The Lottery. In The Lottery, there is a small village that still follows ancient traditions. The tradition in this town is that one person from the village gets stoned each year. This is similar to Mockingjay, because Peeta, Katniss, and the other remaining victors have to fight to death.<br />  Mockingjay takes on a new turn as relationships develop and shatter. I couldn't stop reading this book! I would give this book a 4 out of 5. Suzanne Collins writes very descriptively and vividly, so much that it seems like you are right there fighting with Katniss. Overall, I really liked the book but I didn't like the ending. It was shocking and a little disappointing that the book ended the way it did.
B006OB3K56|4.0|For those who like the gritty, satisfying-for-not-being-satisfying films, this is for you.  No story, little development, but I was heavily affected.<br /><br />If our favorite self-loathing, vain American Psycho and his self-abusive little sister had all of the sexual hang-ups of Rodger Dodger (2002) then we'd have Michael Fassbender (X-Men: First Class, Haywire) and Carey Mulligan (Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, Drive) from Shame.<br /><br />Brandon (Fassbender) is a NYC exec with an ostentatiously modern, white, sterile condo and a serious sex addiction.  He ever so casually saunters high society lounges and effortless finds company for the evening.  But that doesn't seem to be enough to quench his deep-seeded thirst for--something.  On a daily basis his only smiles are elicited by flirtations or discussions thereof with his partner in crime, his boss.<br /><br />Brandon apathetically ignores his sister's routine calls until one day he comes home to find that she, Sissy (Mulligan), has dropped in unannounced.  This turns into an uncomfortable, family-valueless argument during which Sissy is naked.  She makes no effort to cover up nor does Brandon try to avert his eyes.  They bicker like participants in an unhealthy marriage, which sets the stage for their even more unhealthy relationship as brother and sister.  At this point we can imagine that they've been through something serious together and that they, at some point, strongly depended on one another.  We can also imagine that moral lines may have been crossed.<br /><br />Working a few gigs as a lounge singer, Sissy draws the attention of Brandon's business cohort.  Their affections clearly displease Brandon.  In fact, it incites frustration, resentment, enmity and rage.  Masturbation, full frontal nudity, intense sexual tension and a brilliantly tactful score make this film all about a tone of depravity.  You never quite feel comfortable watching this film, yet you need to know where it's going and why Brandon and Sissy are the way that they are.  Keeping in tune with American Psycho, Brandon has an addiction to pornography and an often cold demeanor that accompany him even in the workplace.<br /><br />On another note, I can't help but to wonder if the man cast as Brandon's waiter (during a date scene) wasn't cast because he looked like a very American Psycho Christian Bale.  The waiter has a surprising among of dialogue, all somewhat humorous, and all interrupting a scene designed to demonstrate that Brandon is romantically challenged and generally disconnected.<br /><br />As Brandon becomes ever more removed from emotionally connecting with anyone else, his sister included, the sexuality becomes rather intense, more frequent and, for some, perhaps difficult to watch.  This film probably won't make you laugh or cry, nor will it lead you to anything resembling catharsis.  It will, however, impress you with the cast's ability to take on this intense--I dare not call it a story--series of scenes.  The character development is unsubtle, but impressive, and the characters may first be considered hyperboles, but they are nothing short of being a little too real for comfort.

0783233477|5.0|Movies like music and art are a subjective experience, so I can understand why there are differences of opinion. I'm a dance teacher among other things and some music makes me want to dance and some not. You can read all the negative reviews of this movie and come away with the idea that is not worth watching. I beg to differ. Watch this with friends and observe their reactions. I watch this movie every few years, and it touches my heart as no other movie has. When life is over I hope I walk out of it the way William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) does, and I pray I am escorted there by someone like Joe Black (Brad Pitt).
B006P4FBUE|5.0|It works really good and plays a wide variety of sounds. But take note: it only plays one octave. But overall, a great app to have on your kindle!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Gripping, brutally honest, leaving out no details, engaging to the finish. We have a mountain cabin near the PCT and occasionally meet the hikers, all of whom have a story.  This book should appeal to both women and men (I am the latter ).  Read on a Kindle, missing slightly the ability to scrutinize the map.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy required a conclusion that was balanced between the pervasive anti-establishment tone of the three books and the \\"hopeful for the future\\" outlook that adolescents need to finish. The more realistic all-dead finale would have risked an epidemic depression of teens in the countries that this freedom tome has infected. Within these boundaries I feel Ms. Collins has maintained the tension, and not sacrificed the heroes, as per 1984. While some may accuse her of pandering with a softball ending, I am grateful that she focused the resolution on the family, not the State. The young minds have enough imagination to consider that multiple \\"next generational\\" story lines are available to satisfy individual needs for security or vigilance or self-reliance, etc.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|it has not been updated for at least three months! The newest version @Google play is updated on may 11th.

I can hear her songs being blasted from car stereos all Summer long. Nicely done.

I didn't get the Valentine's Day update until May.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|If you have to see a comic book movie, let it be this one.  This is after all the sequel to five different movies, and it features an all-star cast.  Also, there's just something about an ensemble cast fighting to defend the earth from total annihilation that makes us tingle with excitement.<br /><br />Because there's been so much praise for the Avengers movie I'd like to make a few criticisms.  First, I think the plot was too contrived and artificial, and I think the movie would have benefited from just a lot more special effects and bang and boom.  Second, I think it would add a great deal to the drama if Thor and the Hulk were not so invincible.  Couldn't they just bleed a little?<br /><br />Nevertheless, like everyone else, I am greatly anticipating part two of this trilogy.
0545128285|5.0|Replying to several calls from fans asking to have copies of this book that she wrote and gave to seven people involved in the publication of Harry Potter, J K Rowling finally published in 2008 a first edition of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, whose sales would go to the author's foundation, Children's High Level Group.<br /><br />Illustrated by Rowling herself, this book also offers snippets and interpretations from Dumbledore's letters as he originally gave the book to Hermione at the start of the seventh book. Speking of those notes, it is interesting to read them as we learn that those Beedle stories had an impact on Harry Potter's story itself, especially one who led to the debacle between Lucius Malfoy and Dumbledore during the Chamber of Secrets plot. Though there were times I wished it had one or two more stories so that we could get more meat on this wonderful wizard world Rowling has revealed to us, I am glad to have in my library a copy of Beedle's fairy tales, which cover different genres, going from comedy to pure horror (such as for the tale with the hairy heart).

0439321603|5.0|If you've read all the Harry Potter books, or even a few of them, and would like to know more about the Wizard World in which Harry, his friends and millions of other wizards get to live, this book is a must to buy.<br /><br />As a copy of an official school book Harry has to buy and read during his studies, and written by Newt Scamander (Luna Lovegood's eventual grandfather-in-law), Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them covers a large range of magical creatures from all around the world. Not only that, it also covers Muggle and their perceptions of the Wizard world and its creatures.<br /><br />Written in a clear and simple way, this book also offers gorgeous ink drawings done by J K Rowling, who originally wanted to illustrate her book chapters by herself, along with some funny comments by Dumbledore and Harry Potter and his friends, as they take note of what is an Acromantula, a Billywig, or a Puffskein.<br /><br />In the end, this book is a nice short treat for fans of Harry Potter, but also to fans of all magical creatures.

0345803485|1.0|All I can say is that if a student in my creative writing class turned in this dreck, s/he would receive an F.  This is tepid, sub-par vampire pornography.  The entire concept is weak, unoriginal, and poorly executed.  This type of work is the stuff we as teenage writers used to hide in our closets for fear we'd be exposed as mawkish, unimaginative copiers.  How this writer has taken the worst of the worst, spit patched it together, and make so much money out of it is beyond me.  Have we as a society really sunk this low?
0345803485|2.0|I won't lie. I decided to read this book after hearing it described as \\"mommy porn\\" because I have a healthy and shameless interest in all things scandalous. And now that I've read it...I'm ashamed. Very ashamed.<br /><br />Where do I start? Firstly, I find the heroine to be completely implausible. And I'm a fan of fantasy. Goblins, dragons and magic trees are more believable than the character of Anastasia Rose Steele...even her name is absurd. Am I to believe that Ana is truly a twenty-one-year-old woman who has never touched herself? What ridiculously puritanical suburb of Portland/Seattle is this book supposed to be set in? And yet, by chapter three she's climaxing like a pro every sixteen seconds. If the author is going to abuse her readers' willingness to suspend their disbelief, she might as well throw in a vampire or two. Oh wait...that's been done already.<br /><br />Ana is naive and immature and without any sort of endearing qualities. If her innocence is supposed to make her more likeable; it doesn't. Her self-deprecating attitude elicits no feelings of sympathy. She's boring, clumsy and possibly the most undynamic character ever written.<br /><br />Secondly, I firmly believe that a chimpanzee edited this book. The repetition is unbearable. Ana is constantly besieged. Grey is always mercurial. She flushes. He gasps. There are countless instances of eye-rolling and lip-biting. Ana is supposedly a college graduate that majored in literature. So why is it that she can only express herself with combinations of the words \\"crap\\" and \\"jeez\\"? Holy crap, super crap, jeez, double-dog crap, jeez, crap, jeez.  And then we have Christian who, on every other page, is smiling a crooked smile with hooded eyes and his mouth hanging open. I was beginning to think that he had been in some sort of automobile accident that left his face badly mangled. And apparently he has long fingers because Ana comments on it. All. The. Time. I started picturing him as E.T. And when Grey's brother is introduced as Elliot--well--I couldn't stop laughing.<br /><br />Finally, the sex. It was entertaining at first.  But it quickly becomes tired, distracting and unnecessary. The one redeeming quality I feel this book has is Christian's mysterious and traumatic past. It's the only thing that kept me turning pages. I'd be reading along, excited that I was finally going to uncover an interesting and important plot point, when all of a sudden...oh...nope...they're doing it again. Sigh.<br /><br />This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but it's far from the best. I wish I had borrowed it from someone, because it's definitely not worth the ten bucks I paid for it (curse you, NYT, for deceiving me!). I do feel there is an interesting story buried beneath the overwritten sex and horrendous dialogue. So I do plan on finishing this series only because I am truly interested in what it is that shaped Grey into the man he is. And it better be damn good.brother is introduced as Elliot--well--I couldn't stop laughing.<br /><br />Finally, the sex. It was entertaining at first.

I have tried it on both 4g and WiFi but it just doesn't work.  it will find my computer, but then it is very laggy and eventually boots me from the connection.<br /><br />I wish it worked better.
B007EC27QM|1.0|it sad error and stayed like that l hate this lame app don't waste time and money. this. lame. app and it crashed my. kindle. no I am not gonna download. it ever again
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is a look forward to read trilogy.  You can't really say one book is better than the other, because it's a whole.  You finish one and have to get the next to continue on the story.  Great summer read.
B0018LX9T4|4.0|After seeing this movie you will want your boss to do things to you that are quite interesting (if you like him).<br />After watching this I felt funny about the whole thing but there was something inside of me that let me know there are tons of people in relationships like this and they WORK!  I would venture to say when people interact the way these two do there is a chance there will be no infidelity why go outside when you can find this thrill at work and at home.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a fun game. Similar to something like Sudoku. I like math type puzzles. I need to put this game down...but can't
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is really a bestseller? Personally, I wish I could wave my wand and replace all these crappy books with Anne Rice's Beauty series. Now that was a seriously sexy, well-written BDSM series. The 50 shades is like erotica lite. It tries so hard to be that it just falls flat. I'm sure it's great for someone who hasn't read any of the classic erotica, as a stepping stone. But for those of us that know what the real deal is....no thank you.<br /><br />Put it this way.....if you like vampires....this would be the twilight of the genre.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The writing is simple, fantasy-like for a teen. I love reading, but I never have the time to read as much as I'd like. after hearing all the hype I decided to give this book a-go, I read it from cover to cover in three days on my breaks at work. I actually agree with all the bad reviews read so far.<br />Main plot: Anastsia- college senior, virgin, who has not even masturbated once in her life meets Christian Grey, billionaire, super handsome who has had many sexual partners and escapades in his 26 years of life, commitment phobic and quite predictable with his carnal needs. Despite their differences, they begin giving each other many FIRSTS experiences together. Despite the fact that he never takes women serious, uses women for his sexual need, has strict non-disclosure contract with his sexual partners Christian Grey forgets all that with Ana and even has her meet his family, introduces himself as her boyfriend to her family. (what a ridiculos premise)  Quickly,  their sexual encounters becomes boring, repetitious and down right predictable and not sexy!<br />Ana's ongoing climax filled existence with Christian is so outrageously far from reality that she achieves this by simple touching, breathing, talking and just thinking.  That such a far outcry from reality for a woman who is in early stages of sexual experience.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the author was abused as a child or in her previous relationships with men because I find the writing on the verge of promoting domestic violence. No, I'm not talking about the illicit s&m the book tries to claim. I'm referring to the way Christian Grey knows many details about Anastasia that she never told him about. Details like her home address, her mothers address across county, how he emiails her 24/7, ends up in the same hotel as where her mother and Ana are having drinks at 3000 miles from Christains home, details like that are frankly not healthy, stalker-ish and on the verge of dating violence.<br /><br />I find that disturbing as many young women are abused nowadays or the men they date have the on an electronic leash, constant emailing, texting and calling. Many of the women nowadays misinterpret dating abuse with a man who loves them and is giving them attention. Clearly the lack of father and the 4 marriages Anas mother has had, play a huge part in Ana's relentless thinking this man's abusive ways with her are actually chivalry.<br /><br />Another thing I don't want to fail to mention is the fact that about a quarter of the book is Christian Grey and Anastasia emailing each other, each time changing the subject line on their reply. I'm sorry, but that's not the Way people email. Plus, when do men do more of the talking/writing in comparison to women??? Guess what, this Grey man does! Another complete fantasy the author has. Men are not like that.<br /><br />I think it's intended audience should be teens who fantasize about the day they will lose their virginity, virgins who think sex will be so easy, or housewives who are probably terribly out of touch with their husbands or simply bored with the Poindexter boyfriends in their life. Ladies, we can't possibly be that bored to believe this type of book, seriously. Besides, many women despite having sex do not climax as soon as they have any type of contact with a man and especially not every single time. Women are just not that easy. Women are built different.<br />(((Ana is Bella from twilight, apparently the author wrote this series w. her in mind, google it, and it even takes place in Seattle wa, what an imagination. Not)))<br />I am not going to recommend this book, maybe read the free kindle sample, or go into the bookstore and read 35 pages on your break
B007JM4CWY|5.0|A good version of this puzzle game. Very enjoyable and nice job. Highly recommend.  Would like to have an easier way to fill in several cells at once.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Has all the elements I look for - interesting and unique storyline, in this case with Warriors of the 6th Order the champions of the Realm and the Faith; thoroughly  researched and, most importantly, very well written, however spell check errors are present - though minor. Not overdone, well balanced (thankfully lacks boring details of both long battles and extensive travels);  Good characterisation, an appealing main character with solid supporting characters and all the wiles and deceits to enthrall; fast moving and entertaining - sufficiently complex to make it interesting. In a nutshell, a great read - easy and addictive.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think it could use some work. I don't like how the games are always locked and some games are confusing<br />yeah I guess its ok
0345803485|5.0|Intense, sweet, sexy, interesting, flowing, angonizing... loved it!<br />Gray is a force to be understood and cared for not demonized -  I want one.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I got on a few days after I got this app...<br />I swear I had a monster section, a wizard, demigod.<br />Now if I try to remake them, its says that doesn't make a combination.
B006N9KFPC|5.0|I LOVE this CD.  Music is so good, his voice is phenomenal.  I just loved Underneath and Outlaw of Love.  I haven't stopped listening to it.  His voice is just wonderful.  The fast songs have you bopping.  Really really love this CD!
B007P6VM04|4.0|The Music of SMASH, a CD with great music as well as a great show. Hope they make a volume 2 CD with more songs from the show.
B001OGRLOC|1.0|This is my least favorite release by Testament. I own everything else by them except this and 'The Ritual' (2 star release). They are both thin, boring and lack any type of aggression. There is not one song on this cd that I like. This isn't thrash...this was their attempt to get on the radio. I don't care if they rushed or not, this is just not good material. There are too many great releases by this band to waste time on this one.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|So far, its a great note application. I use it daily on mtablet & cellphn. I believe I made a sound investment.
B001A7ZJWQ|2.0|I was a fan of Testament as soon as 'The Legacy' came out. BIG FAN. While they had already started to slow their thrash down on 'Practice What You Preach' at least it had good songs. I found this release to be too mainstream, slick and just plain boring. Chuck has no intensity or edge to his vocals. The only songs I can still listen to on here are 'Electric Crown' and 'Let Go Of My World'. The best thing I can say about this release is that it is better than the 1-star 'Souls of Black' cd they did. Ugh.
1439156816|5.0|Fabulous book, very honest. I really came to love Stephen King through this volume--I really connected with the details of his life. For example I was very impressed with his honesty when he depicts his struggle with addiction. The last part of the book where he talks about his accident his poignant as well.<br /><br />A great book about art and life.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book makes 50 Shades of Grey look like mere child's play. I loved it and devoured every page. I cannot wait till 'Deeper In You'. Yes, it is very sexual but I think that that only adds to the pure raw emotion between our two main characters. I am hooked and ready for more!
B007O3QC8K|5.0|Yes, this is a great recording indeed.  Even the final movement is powerfully plausible and believable compared to the many previous renditions and recordings of it....however, although S/P/C/M incorporate themes from the previous 3 movements, they DO NOT incorporate Bruckner's INTENTION of including themes from his Symphonies 5, 7 & 8!  (We know this from letters and anecdotes of Bruckner's close friends).<br /><br />The only conductor to go out on a limb and follow Bruckner's original wishes is Peter Jan Marthe.  He produced a live recording and a new finale a few years ago which provoked a lot of controversy.  Some found it blasphemous and disastrous while others praised him for it.  You can find it on youtube for those of you, who are interested. It is quite drastic actually to compare the SPCM version with Marthe's.<br /><br />All in all...Rattle's is a great recording.
0439023491|5.0|This was an absolutely riveting read! It had everything that an excellent novel needs, action, drama, suspense. You will see Katniss like you have never seen here before and will love it. I have recommended this book to many of my friends and I will continue to do so. Enjoy!
B00828HWJE|3.0|I was finally able to watch this and I have to say that I enjoyed it. I do agree with some other reviews that the story did have some plot holes, which was the main flaw of the movie. It felt like a lot of the scenes were missing about 5 min that would explain why the next scene plays out how it does. Still, this didn't really affect most of the overall enjoyment factor for me. I thought Cung Le was a cool lead. He has minimal dialog, which is probably a good thing, so he comes off as the strong silent type. As we all know, JC only has a small part...probably about 10 minutes spread throughout the whole movie. His scenes and his performance are both very cool though. I didn't really care for how his back story was explained but no big deal. Peter Weller was a blast to watch as Mr.V as well. The fights do have a lot of slow motion thrown into them but it actually works for the most part. It allows you to feel the brutality of street fighting...plus you see everything clearly, which is great. Hyams knows how to stay on a scene, which I love. As far as the side characters go, they are all cliched but the acting is actually pretty solid. The guy who plays Beach probably delivers one of the best crack head performances I've seen in a movie. The ending is very abrupt but I felt like it actually fit the tone of the movie. Like Regeneration, I really enjoyed the subtle music score from Michael Krassner too. Overall, the movie isn't great but I thought it was a well made little indie action flick. It totally felt like a late 80's/early 90's \\"beat em up\\"  like Road House or Perfect Weapon.  3.25/5
B007NESBK2|5.0|I pre ordered the DVD and as one of the other reviews states the lighting and set are just magical. Sade voice and looks get better with age. Her Band Sweet Back just pulls the whole package together. This is a must have for your collection.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a challenging game that does involve a lot of complicated rules. Definitely a good game to pass the time with.
B002FGU3YU|4.0|Fit is good. The arch is a little flat initially. However, after about 20 miles it starts conforming to your foot. I use these sandals for everything: work, basketball, handball, biking, soccer, hiking, and backpacking. When using for sports be sure to cinch tight for good lateral support and grip. In fact these sandals offer better ankle protection than most shoes. I buy about 3/8\\" long than needed to protect from bumping my toes. At rest, just ease up on the straps.<br /><br />A feature of these sandals that you can't get in shoes is fitting the arch. Just center your arch on the sandal with all straps opened up. Then close the back strap. That strap shouldn't have to be adjusted ever again.<br /><br />Also when backpacking and crossing streams, just walk through! They dry out fast. This is the all purpose comfortable backpacking foot wear. At night just loosen the straps for camp slipper feel.<br /><br />The grip is about 10x better than vibram; especially on wet sloping granite surfaces. Spider rubber is amazing. They dry out very fast. I love open toe sandals because closed-toe sandals collects and keeps muck against your toes.  When doing sports, I recommend wearing with socks and cinching tight to prevent blisters. Socks keep the sweat wicked out from the bottom of your feet and eliminates shoe smell and athlete's foot.<br /><br />The Terra Fi 2's were MUCH MUCH better at keeping out rocks. Now I have to stop about once/hour and use my finger to flick out a rock (it doesn't take much time though). But with the Tera Fi2's, I could go for 8 hours w/o flicking out a rock. Therefore I think Teva went backward in their design; and that's worth a point drop to me. Tera Fi2's are a 5 star.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|the hungry games is a book that keeps you reading and wanting more . i definitley recommend this book for all ages .
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed the books on our Kindles on Ipad.  Havng the 3 books together made it easy to begin the next one without having to find the next book.
B007OSBS0M|5.0|Great show and Amazon video is a great way to watch it. No comercials and on my own time. The image and sound are clear.
B004CGUC06|3.0|Amaracord, considered to be Fellini's most personal film to date, impressed me in some way, and fell flat for me in others. While I did find the adventures of Tita to be funny and adventurous, I really didn't quite grasp on to the whole eposodic nature of the whole film. The story, if one can really call it a story, shows a year in the life of a small town in Italy and discusses some interesting people. Fellini, while harnessing the local color of the piece, fails to present us with any reason at all to care for the people he discusses or gives us any conflict or exposition to introduce us to the characters. With that being said, I didn't entirely dislike the film. On the contrary, I found it to be rather enjoyable, but not a movie that I can watch any time whenever I feel like popping in a good film. For me, it just falls a little flat.
B007SY3CEW|3.0|The song selection is good and its a lot of fun. However if you're using the kindle fire version it only registers two key hits,  making it hard to play the cords. All in all I 'd say its a fun app and worth the money. If they fix the 3 key strokes problem it would be excellent!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm amazed at how many reviewers supposedly read these books and have written negative comments when they obviously have no clue about the genre.  It's really very simple. If you have a rigid, uptight sense of morality and don't like to read about graphic sex, don't read these books. If you're humorless and take yourself way too seriously, don't read these books. If your mind is completely closed to BDSM and you're convinced that it is abuse, don't read these books.  If you demand unrelenting realism and don't like contemporary romantic fairytales, don't read these books. If you're overly concerned with how many times words and phrases are repeated and don't understand common literary devices, don't read these books. If you're a dried-up scold who oozes prudishness out of every pore, DON'T READ THESE BOOKS.  Problem solved.  For the rest of us voluptuaries that enjoy a lusty romance, these books are a lot of fun!!!<br /><br />I plan on reading the third book in the series this weekend while lounging on my porch drinking a chilled glass of Pinot Grigio.  I eagerly anticipate continuing the sensual delight of the Fifty Shades trilogy, and I'm confident that the third book  won't disappoint.
B007N0REX6|5.0|Slash kills it! Some of his best work to date is found on this disc and Myles Kennedy just grows on you through repeated listenings.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|There have been some glitches but the developers have been rolling out updates.  It's worth being patient. I really enjoy the game and look forward to growing my town.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I had never heard of this kind of puzzle before, but it reminds me of the logic puzzles we used to get in grade school. (You know, the kind where you had to match a person to their favorite color, for example, by using a list of true statements and the process of elimination.)  I am addicted!<br /><br />I got this app for free, but I would have gladly paid $5 for it now that I know what it is. Lots of puzzles, so it should keep me busy for awhile.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book should be required reading for all teachers, university professors and employers. This book not only validates those with an introverted personality, but elevates them to the level they deserve in out society. Only wish that it was written earlier so that I could have given copies to my 21 year old, introverted daughter's teachers amd university professors. She also read it, and kept saying \\"so that's why I...\\"
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had heard so much chatter about this book, so I decided to check it out on Amazon. I read the first few pages and decided \\"how bad could it be?\\" I purchased it for my Kindle. Now that I am  almost finished (my husband has my Kindle and is  reading it too) I can honestly say other than the porn, (if that's what you're looking for) it's a waste of time. It is so poorly written, there is soooo much repetition (thanks to one reviewer who took the time to count them)that I can only say it is NOT worth my time or money to see what happens to this quirky couple! My 23 year old granddaughter tells me it's just a copy of Twilight, with the names changed, and I tend to believe her. The author doesn't show much originality at all, other than to find new ways of repeating the same things over and over again. There are so many better written and more interesting books out there, I will not waste my time reading any more of any of the \\"Grey\\" series.
0345803493|5.0|I put my awesome guy and I in the books as the main characters so I could relate to all their experiences.  I read all of the books in two weeks and totally loved how the characters learned to understand each other so well.  The books read smoothly and were intently interesting from beginning to end.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|awesome game.  it did freeze a couple of times.  but when working it is great.  very well thought out.  and quite addictive
B003UBTX7C|1.0|Really bad. Poor writing. Boring characters. Silly plot. Did Baldacci just mail this one in or was it a ghost writer (I hope).
0061726834|2.0|As the title says, this was a good story, but it dragged on very slow. I enjoy reading more upbeat and faster stories.
0345803485|5.0|This series just made my top five favorite series of all time! It's funny, sensual...a MUST read!! It's just about every fantasy ANY woman has ever had!
0374384576|5.0|I purchased this book for my grandson's 6th birthday.  He already has a lot of books by this author. He and his 3 year old brother love them. I received the book in a timely manner.  Even before the expected arrival date. It arrived in excellent shape. And, of course, it was a big hit!!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Watched the bluray it comes with a very nice black slip cover with embossed letters in Gold very attractive I always prefer Blurays with slip covers. The movie is awesome with fantastic audio the first half hour is ok but after that there is solid action machine guns, mini guns, helicopters,motor boats,car chase, explosions the audio is just incredible. I recommend this bluray to anyone who prefers action with very good audio & video too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to say that I loved all 3 of these books, they are nothing like Twilight, I wish that I could find a man like Christian Grey. Although he is very over protective and sometimes overbearing he does these things out of love. Everything he does is out of love and because he wants to be loved. I don't know call me a hopeless romantic but I give all 3 books a thumbs up or rather 5 stars!!!!
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was very entertaining throughout. It is very well written and the interaction between the main characters was a hoot! This is my first Thea Harrison book and I'm looking forward to reading more from this author. This is my new favorite and is my go to book when I need something to read. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|AS a retired teacher, I decided to read the Hunger Games to see what was creating such interest.  As a senior citizen, I thought it might not be too interesting for me but decided to download and read it.  I really liked it!  Katniss was an extremely resourceful character and had great compassion for her family and friends. Now I am interested in reading more.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app was made to run smoothly on the kindle fire.  The offline feature is also nice.  I do wish there were more offline versions of the Bible.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Quite addictive if you're a problem-solver. I didn't expect it to be so much fun. Really great game. Highly recommend!
B004UID2LC|3.0|I absolutely LOVED this app until it stopped working. nothing would download today so i tried upsating it and the update failed. i then uninstalled it and tried t download it and the download failed. PLEASE fix!!!!!! :-(
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I found this movie to be fun and enjoyable. Although it was very similar to the original movie, I did like the slight twist of a few events; for example (location and certain scenes with the fly swatter). Jackie and Jaden were a great team. It brought back memories of the orginal Karate Kid (1-4), which I am in the process of searching to add to my history of DVD collection.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|One of the best games out there. Super fun and complex at times. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves passing time.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This USB Cable is smaller then the original one that came with my Kindle but this one looks and feels like it won't be coming apart like the original one did. I tested it out by charging my Kindle and so far so good. Its nice to be able to depend on Amazon.com to make things right if something isn't right.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This would be it. Great little time killer. Not very many features or modes or anything to justify the steep price but great format and interface.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|If you like these kinds of puzzle games it's fun. Controls were a little hard to use and it takes some getting used to
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use evernote daily.  With evernote on my phone I rarely make paper notes.  Having copied text,  notes, pictures, etc saved across multiple devices automatically is just icing on the cake.  Edit:  May 2017 still using Evernote.   Absolutely great app.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Like a train wreck, I couldn't pull myself away from the book.  The books in this series are very repetitive, and my eyes started glazing over when they had sex yet again. I was so disappointed when I finished the first book because of the annoying repetitive phrases. On the other hand, I could not stop thinking about the characters and what was in store for them. After I started skimming past all of the \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscience\\" references, enjoyed the story line. it took less than 2 weeks to get through the trilogy. I would read this story, but with a more realistic expectation.
B005LAIH2W|3.0|\\"This wild tale begins thirteen years ago, in the Arizona Territory, between the Pinale&ntilde;o Mountains and the backside of hell.\\" After Civil war vet John Carter (Kitsch) refuses to join the new army he is imprisoned. After an escape he finds refuge in a cave where he meets a stranger with a strange medallion. Curious, Carter touches it and is transported out of the cave. He soon learns he is on Mars and is in the middle of another war. Going in to this I heard all the bad reviews and that this is the biggest bomb in Disney's history. I really didn't think it could be as bad as that. While I won't say it was good it was a little better then I expected. The biggest downfall to me is that it was pretty boring and seemed to drag the entire time. I also have to admit that although this is my opinion this movie seems very much geared toward younger boys. My 13 year old son thought it was OK and really liked the little monster dog thing. I thought that was cool too. I have to say that if you liked \\"Prince Of Persia\\" you will probably like this too. I just had a hard time getting into it. Overall, A slow moving and pretty boring movie that was a mix of \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Avatar\\". Again though if you have a young son he will probably like this one. I give it a C+, my son gave it an A-.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|kids love it. they like planning how to use energy plus teaches management of resources and time.<br />I think its good for critical thought and decision making.
0374203032|4.0|Philosophers help us explore answers to important questions. Harvard professor Michaael J. Sandel asks some of those important questions in a new book titled, What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets. Democracy requires that citizens share in common life as we blend in with one another in the course of daily living. How do we want to live together? Do we want a society where everything is for sale? \\"Are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy?\\" (p.203). Any reader interested in these questions should consider reading this fine book.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
1400052181|2.0|The writer pulled off a very good subject: The enormous, but recognized, contribution of Henrietta Lacks' cell line to medical discovery, and the controversial medical practice of taking patients' cells without patients' consent.<br /><br />Similar to many 3-star reviews, I felt the book was a let-down in term of the writer devoting many more pages depicting her efforts in researching the book than writing about Henrietta Lacks.  The first 100 pages were tightly woven and well-written, and the next 210 pages went steep down-hill from there on, dragging along with every minor details of the conversations between the writer and Lacks' family.<br /><br />Writing the emotional struggles of Lacks' family from the eyes of a scientific journalist makes the book read like reporting rather than the works of a skillful story-teller that connects people to their feelings.

0439023513|2.0|Having read the previous 2 Hunger Game books, Mockingjay has to be the worst. Before I began reading, I heard reviews about how unsatisfying it was. I went in open-minded, and I actually thought the first half of it was decent. The second half was a complete and utter mess concerning Katniss's character and the death of major characters.<br /><br />--SPOILERS--<br /><br />1. Katniss basically becomes a rogue vigilante who enters into a random women's home and kills people. She kills the future President after she wins the war, out of vengeance for the death of her sister. Not only that, she's basically exonerated because a Doctor says she has a mental break down. No court cases, no further investigation.<br /><br />2. Can someone tell me why did they even choose to rescue Peeta and Finnick's gf? It's a pretty necessary risk of the rebels, especially how they had almost sacrificed the lives of major characters. The rescue really wasn't described and seemed too easy.<br /><br />3. Gale is given no further explanation and disappears completely after Katniss kills the President. Does he still love her? I think Collins completely dropped it on this one.<br /><br />4. Apparently Katniss and Haymitch vote for another Hunger Games for those high officials in the Capitol. Will the cycle of violence ever stop? What's the point in a main character who is willing to stoop to the level of the Capitol?<br /><br />5. I really didn't feel much emotional attachment to any of the characters that died. When main characters just started dropping out of no where, I was indifferent. The author didn't seem to invest much into them.<br /><br />In conclusion, the book was actually difficult to get through, and felt like I was in the trenches of World War I. Mixed with a lot of unreasonable dialogue, awkward plot twists, and an inconsequential frayed ending, I can't recommend this book.
0345803507|5.0|The final in the trilogy was just fantastic!!!  Things happened that were just not expected at all.  I was spellbound once again and couldn't put the book down.  Totally enjoyed the whole series and would recommend it highly.  It will change your relationship, guaranteed!!!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Really interesting. The twist at the end was remarkable.
1612130585|5.0|Hardly waited for the second book in the series to arrive.  Couldn't put it down when I did get it!!!  This was just a great continuation from book one.  Has definitely made a difference in my husband and my relationship after 40 years together.  A totally GREAT difference.  So thankful for these books.
0345803485|2.0|This book was just not for me.  I found it a bit redundant and a little over the top but most people love it so I guess one just has to read to see what the hype is about...

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Cant live without the word and to beagle to access it on my kindle is awesome. I enjoy the daily plans but do wish there were more choices to choose from. Overall truly blessed to have it. Thank you and keep up the good work!
B0001Z37HM|5.0|Sonja?! Sonja?! heeheehee ...<br /><br />This is awesome swordplay, especially between Sonja and Arnold's character. Overall, this movie has less gore than the Conan films of the same time period, and has a kid tie-in. I guess the filmmakers were aiming at a younger audience. Ah well.<br /><br />The Story is kind of corny, but plays out well. There is nice action, but no really terrifying creatures. Still, this is a great sword-n-sorcery film, and the colors are very nice. Besides, Sonja is kind of hot.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have the Conan films, this is a must-have!

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I am satisfied with the product as well as the shows themselves. This looks to be one of the best shows currently. Well worth the money spent.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This is an awesome action-packed film! Not much story, just a defense against a bunch of conquerors and a last-ditch effort to save the world. This is Historical! Of course, the script is Hollywood ... who knows what actually happened? Still, this has riveting and gory battle sequences that should not be missed!<br /><br />It is said that this battle saved Democracy and Europe. History is what it is.<br /><br />The film uses a lot of CGI, and I mean A LOT. It is a must-have for any action collector!

B002BI6SMI|5.0|An urban legend comes to life!  Young girls (and boys) should watch this as a precautionary tale to anyone who is going to travel abroad or domestic, or when you meet a stranger here or there.<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays a semi absentee father who has been working as a highly trained operative on missions around the world.  His time away from home cost him his marriage, now his teenage daughter has asked through his ex wife to take a trip to Europe.  At first she tells him that they will be going to museums and doing touristy things, but he finds just before she leaves that they are really going to travel across Europe to see U2 on the European leg of their tour.  Reluctanly, he agrees (even though he is angry that his daughter and his ex wife lied about it to him) and signs the papers to allow her to travel.  In typical law enforcement manner, Liam demands that his daughter call and let him know where she is at all times.  His daughter and her friend, however, being the stereotypical flaky teenagers they are, say hello to a random stranger they meet at the airport.  He seems friendly enough, offers to share a cab to their destination, then gets their phone number.  Little do they know they are being lured into a trap.  And what a trap it is!  In a panic, his daughter tells her father on the phone that they are being kidnapped.  Liam immediately jumps onto a plane and heads to Paris to track his daughter down from the sex slavery ring she has been lured into.<br /><br />The older I get, the more I see the signifigance of a story like that.  Having traveled abroad and been hassled and hustled by many a suave European man, be cautious.  You never know who is going to take you for a ride.  They may not be pulling you into sex slavery, but they are looking for something else.  And it also happens right here in the US, in your own backyard.  I have several friends in law enforcement, they question everything and anything I do.  \\"DO you know that man you were talking toover there?\\" \\"Yes, I know him from ___\\".  Paranoid?  It has merit.  A stranger is not just a friend you haven't met, you must be very careful with people with what you do and say, because you simply do not know what others are capable of or what they are after.  As a kid, you do not believe that people will treat you like a piece of meat, but they will.  Just wait until it happens to you.<br /><br />Some words of criticism?  It was a bit hoaky that Liam would actually find his daughter with all the hoops he had to jump through.  Granted, he plays a spy who had access to certain information that the average person would not otherwise.  But, after all, this is entertainment about a not so pleasent subject.<br /><br />Be warned, kids, the world is a crazy and dangerous place.  Be tough, street smart, and keep up a shield.  You will need it.

B004SDSSFY|1.0|I had a very good experience with Docs to Go on my Palm and on my iPod Touch, but it is pretty poor with the Kindle Fire. I cannot get Docs to Go on the Kindle Fire to open text files. Curiously, I downloaded QuickOffice Pro and it opens the text files with no problem. Then I opened an Excel file with Docs to Go on the Kindle Fire and the text wrapping feature in the cells was gone, so the cells were unreadable, and the cell sizes were completely distorted. Strangely, I opened the same Excel files in QuickOffice Pro and they opened much better, though not perfectly.<br /><br />On the iPod Touch all the files opened perfectly with Docs to Go. It's odd that something can look so good and readable on the tiny iPod Touch screen, and look awful on the much bigger Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I wrote Docs to Go (DataViz) and asked about the problem. They said re-install Docs to Go on the Kindle Fire, which I did exactly as they instructed, and Amazon has charged me another $15.00 for the application. In addition, it didn't fix any of the problems.  I usually have about a 15-20% success rate fixing stuff like this, so I wasn't surprised.<br /><br />What I really liked about Docs to Go is it's desktop synchronization feature, which, as far as I can see, QuickOffice does not have. I have emailed QuickOffice about this, and they have not responded. Docs to Go responded immediately with erroneous advice. Which is worse, no answer or a bad answer.<br /><br />So, at the same time I'm reading the Steve Jobs biography, and I'm thinking, time to go Mac all the way and possibly all these problems with disappear. This has been the story of my life for years, (incompatible programs and things not working as promised or hoped for) and it's getting a little old.<br /><br />Having mobile documents with me at all times is really important, my daily work depends on it, and it has finally become really frustrating how much time it takes to try to fix these things, time that I desperately need toget \\"real work\\" done.<br /><br />Gotta say that I recommend the Steve Jobs biography highly. It really puts in perspective this whole exciting and ridiculous digital adventure that we have all been through in the past 25 years. Once you realize that for years it has been just ordinary people, under great pressure, trying to produce too much software, too fast, for too many users at an affordable price, it's kind of amazing that much of it actually works as it is supposed to.<br /><br />Keep it simple. Sorry this was so long.

I can't believe it's free -- what a great deal.

0618918248|5.0|Wow!  A book with almost 2000 reviews, mostly favorable.  This alone makes it a must read.  The many thoughtful reviews make interesting reading, with many of the reviews having attached comments which allow you to really get into the swing of the arguments swirling through people's minds.  Thank you Amazon for making this forum available!<br /><br />Don't expect to learn anything about this or that God in this book.  You can learn more about the demise of the relationship between the gods and man, in a very entertaining way, by attending Wagner's Ring Series Operas, especially the last of the series, Gtterdmmerung (The Twilight of the Gods; as the gods are consumed in the flames, the curtain falls.)<br /><br />You will learn a great deal about the arguments popular with Dawkins and other modern atheists.  Dawkins has two \\"cranes\\" which are used to construct his arguments.  The first is Darwinism; the evolution of species by mutation and natural selection.  The second is the anthropic principle.  The extremely small probability of a favorable universe that promotes our existence is no problem, since the fact that we know we and our universe exist means that, out of an infinite number of universes (the multiverse) many such as the one we experience must exist.  Gods are not needed to construct such a universe, it will simply occur naturally.<br /><br />But give Dawkins credit here. As a true scientist he does not claim to be absolutely certain of his results and states that he is an agnostic who is 97% sure that he's an atheist.<br /><br />If, as for myself, a library copy of The God Delusion is not the answer, I recommend you buy a used copy.  Many are available for just a few dollars.  Then, if you find you must keep it on your shelf (I didn't,) buy a new copy.  But, in any case, browse the comments, you will be enlightened and entertained.

B002ZG99N6|5.0|This movie was excellent, fine job by Ben Afflec for his direction and not trying to steal the show with any over the top performance and letting Renner get his chops soaking wet Renner was great I loved his over the top Bostonian accent and performance was nothing short of brilliant. This. The Town grabs you by the neck and doesn't let go. The only thing I would have liked more of was Chris Cooper. Also I would like to say Pete Postelwaite ( RIP ) was great as usual.and was an under appreciated actor for the most part, he was scary in the Omen remake and great in the Name of the Father starring Daniel Day Lewis, anyhow the town is one of those movie you can watch again and again 5 stars, I will always tell it like I see it.<br />Scott M

0143038095|4.0|I'm always interested in books about China.  While this book is more about women and their lives than China itself, it still is very interesting and definitely an emotional read.<br /><br />Four daughters and four mothers, all very much different and challenged to understand each other.  This book weaves through their different lives and expresses the difficulties they face, not only in understanding each other, but understanding themselves as well as they struggle to be their own people, despite the expectations of others.  In a sense it also includes the grandmothers, because as the mothers tell their stories, of growing up in China and leaving, their mothers play a big role in shaping their lives and decisions.  It also shows their decisions with where to take their lives and the reactions when something happens that wasn't planned for.  A noticeable story is where the Joy Luck Club name came from and how the actual club was originated, told by the mother of Jing-Mei Woo.<br /><br />I have to say I enjoyed the mothers' stories more than the daughters'.  They just seemed to have more depth to them.  Their struggles seemed more poignant while the daughters' lives dealt more with divorce and jobs.  Not that those aren't hardships, but they're familiar hardships that aren't quite as interesting.  I think my lease favorite character was Waverly, I thought she was a bit conceited and I just couldn't identify with her character at all.  In contrast, Suyuan Woo and her struggles with the war in China were much more interesting and made me appreciate her character more.  The others had their ups and downs as well, but those were the two standouts.<br /><br />I liked the concept of pitting mother against daughter and showing why they acted teh way they did.  I can't speak on how relevant it is to the culture, but it did seem authentic and I really thought at times that I was reading about real people, even if I wasn't.  I can definitely see these people being based off of real life stories.  The writing was nice and full of description, but I did find it confusing keeping track of who's who at times.  There's a small listing in the front of the book but I grew irritated of flipping back and forth to figure out who I was reading about.  Perhaps it was just a bad week for me memory wise, but I think I would have rather had the stories fit together more cohesively so it was easier to follow.<br /><br />A very interesting book and I would definitely say it's earned its reputation as a book club read.  It's one that I could definitely say I would read again.<br /><br />The Joy Luck Club<br />Copyright 1989<br />288 pages<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012real life stories.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the first time I have ever reveiwed a book, but I just have to share before someone else spends money on this huge waste of time. This book is so horribly written it makes Stephanie Meyer look like Shakespeare! I love to read for entertainment, I am not a \\"book snob\\" in the least. This book however should make whatever publishing house that bought it SO ashamed of themselves. To sum it up, \\"He's so hot\\", and \\"I gasped\\" can be seen at least 11 times on each page. Also, any grown woman that describes her vagina as \\"down there\\" needs to go to a WRITING CLASS! There are SOOOOO many better erotica novels for us women to read, stop buying this garbage and focus on real writers, not copycat wannabes!
B007YJS7G4|4.0|My father was an enlisted ball turret gunner in B-24's. He told many stories about WWII but one off my favorites was how the RED TAILS saved his bacon several times. This film was a welcome tribute to the men who fought so well and were dedicated to a tough job they had to fight for to be able to do.<br />Lucas Film did a great job with the CGI of course, and the cast was superb.<br />The 66 men of the RED TAILS who gave their lives deserved this fine tribute.<br />WE FIGHT !!!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|A truly wonderful toy. I am a huge fan of Dr. Who. Tenant was my favorite, so naturally, I bought this sonic screwdriver. The fun that you have with it, is, impossible. First, let me note that I am 13 years old, and still I have fun with such little \\"useless\\" items. Ok, let me get the \\"useless\\" out of the way. Its not useless at all. I used it to win first place in a computer contest. Long story, but basically, I used the secret ink. Anyway, my robot made it in 22 seconds, and blah blah blah. Anyway, it comes with a \\"secret ink\\" pen. (WARNING: VISIBLE ON GLOSSED PAPER. I GAVE THE PEN TO MY FRIEND, AND HE WROTE ON A MAP, NEXT TO \\"ASIA;\\" IS STUPID AND POOR. BASICALLY, IT READ: ASIA IS STUPID AND POOR. YOU COULD SEE IT. Luckily, there is a way, somewhat disgusting, but works, to erase it. Simply use saliva) Anyway, there is also a pen nib. Another note, the pen nibs, after a day or so, come off REALLY easily, or they start wobbling a bit, and it doesn't feel too authentic. So, I decided that since I have a 40 dollar pen anyway, might as will just Crazy Glue the invisible pen in. It REALLY helped. Also, the little think that you use to extend the screwdriver comes off. You can't glue that, because underneath is a screw so you can open it and change the batteries. I just used some tape because it kept on coming off. Anyway, the light IS blue, even though the camera makes it look kind of purple. The light doesn't appear very well when there is a lot of additional light, but that's not that bad. The noise is REALLY cool. I once geeked out and watched an episode with the screwdriver in my hand, and the sound is identical. It's a little quiet, but that's all. You press the bottom button when it's not extended, and the top button when extended. The screwdriver itself feels really realistic, but it has a light toy feel, and that might be my only complaint. BUT, lemme tell you, you will not regret buying this. If you watch Dr. Who, you owe it to yourself to buy it. As a last note, DON'T try to use it on door locks, because it becomes addicting, and you start doing it everywhere, and it looks kind of weird. I still look like a little child, running about, \\"soonincing\\" everything. (just remember, I'm 13, so if you think your \\"grown up,\\" your wrong.<br />As a final note:<br />\\"DON'T DISS THE SONIC!\\" :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Like title says great thinking person's game. Very challenging but once you get the hang of it levels can be completed without hints.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just buy this book. I got the first two in the series when they were free and had to buy the rest. This<br />is some of the best books I have read all year. I can not stand tight enclosed spaces and this along with several other fears were brought to life on the pages of the books. I could not decide which book in the series was my favorite. The flow from one to the next was smooth and the transition flowed effortlessly. My warning would be once you start Wool you will not be able to stop until the very end.

0985114606|2.0|Okay, I really don't like to draw comparisons between books unless I think its absolutely necessary, and in this case I do think it is. I read this because of the rave reviews I heard after reading Fifty Shades of Grey. Now, I'll be honest. Fifty Shades of Grey was not my favorite book in the least, and Bared To You is much better written, but I do have to give Fifty Shades one thing: It was much more compelling in my opinion. I had problems with Fifty Shades, mostly with the dialogue and the constant mentioning of Ana's \\"Inner Goddess\\", but this one was worse. I can see that the author has talent.Sylvia Day is a better writer than E.L. James, point blank period. Some of her descriptions and word choices were riveting, but I think it eventually fell flat for me in a few regards. I ended the book pretty much scratching my head about a few details, which I think should have merited more importance. What did Gideon and Eva love about each other? Besides the fact that they were both physically attractive and could burn up the sheets? There really wasn't anything lovable about Gideon (for me at least). Sure he was hot, the heroine makes sure you know that in many different places throughout the book, but what else? I found myself liking Eva and Cary's relationship more, at least until the orgy scene, which I thought was overkill. You already knew that Cary sabotages his own love life without the in your face scene.<br /><br />When I started reading this I knew that it was going to be part of a series, but I thought that maybe it would be about other people mentioned in the book. I didn't realize that it was going to be a continuation of this story, which I guess if I had then I wouldn't have been irritated at the ending to this one. Even though it was the first part of a series I still felt that it didn't end in a satisfactory manner. I'm a very open reader and I know that is author writes other things that I might be willing to try, but I will not be reading the next book in this series unless my local library gets it and I can read it for free.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|....if you're 10 years old or less.<br />Daniel Radcliffe did a very good job on the acting...the special effect were few and far between, but were okay.....the story line was good, but just lead up to and lead up to and lead up to a not so scary movie.<br />I was disappointed in the movie overall, but maybe for those really young kids this might keep them in suspense.

B007549W62|3.0|An unusual end-of-the-world drama \\"The Divide\\" focuses on nine survivors holed up in a basement after a nuclear strike on New York. There's more to the story than that. While I don't think you'll come back to \\"The Divide\\" again and again, the film has some strong performances that make it interesting. There's an incident that occurs midway through that suggested this could have been a better, different movie but what we have is at least worth a rental. It's a depressing rental but it's not a bad film.<br /><br />The cast includes Michael Biehn ([[ASIN:B004RE29PO Aliens [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B0014BQR38 The Magnificent Seven: The Complete Series]]), Lauren German ([[ASIN:B003R4ZMNQ Hawaii Five-0: The First Season]]), Ashton Holmes ([[ASIN:B001VNB54A The Pacific [Blu-ray]]]), Milo Ventimiglia ([[ASIN:B003H9LIZC Heroes: The Complete Series]]), Courtney Vance ([[ASIN:B003PGNBO8 FlashForward: The Complete Series]]), Rosanna Arquette ([[ASIN:B005JZBPHS The L Word: The Complete Series]])and Michael Eklund ([[ASIN:B003L77G2Y Fringe: The Complete Third Season]])all of whom give terrific performances helping to create more dramatic tension in this thriller.<br /><br />There aren't any special features included except for the trailer.<br /><br />\\"The Divide\\" isn't a great movie but it's worth a rental.

B003X9W98G|5.0|Whomever plays the Doctor, whomever plays the companion, this series is fun, campy, smart, campy, over-the-top, and did I mention it's campy? I am thoroughly amused by reviewers who find the series too cartoonish. Seriously? Did you miss the whole point? Spoiler alert to the clueless: It's SUPPOSED to be cartoonish! If you want to watch something completely believable, without a hint of tongue-in-cheek silliness; something that never goes over the edge or even close to it, a show that features a guy flying around in a time machine/spaceship that looks like a blue call box is probably not the best choice. But for the rest of you: you GET it. So stop reading this and watch the next episode! Get your daily allotment of the good Doctor's cartoonish cleverness!

Which European country was the past colonial master and how did it respond?<br /><br />If you're like me, even if you lived through the Biafran saga - when was that again? - your knowledge is/was incomplete. Yes there was a tragedy which involved those issues and images from the first paragraph above. But the genesis of the conflict? The outcome?<br /><br />The beautifully narrated Half of a Yellow Sun filled in the many gaps in my knowledge of this tragic chapter in African post-colonialism. Adichie follows up her impressive debut novel Purple Hibiscus with a richly nuanced story of the Biafran separatist effort told from the perspective of five main characters: the teenage houseboy, the academic revolutionary, the twin sisters from a powerful and corrupt trading family, and the ex-pat gone native after colonial rule. Each perspective illuminates a group that suffered and survived, but not without tragedy and loss.<br /><br />With intimate understanding of her tribal and national culture, of her family history, and of the impact international diplomacy had on local events, Adiche creates a compelling and powerful narrative. The main characters come of age as does the newly independent country at a time and within an environment when self-interest among nations created a disastrous situation for the innocents on the ground.<br /><br />These individuals caught in the vice of history first met when struggling to make their ways in the heady world of independence.

1881273377|5.0|I learned a tremendous amount reading the 5 Love Languages; found it applicable to all relationships. It helped me realize what I could have / should have done in a relationship that lasted 25 years. We are separated now; my husband has the CD. I'm hoping that this will serve as the impetus to begin a conversation as well as marriage counseling with a counselor who is familiar with Mr. Chapman's books. I copied down several quotes that I have next to the bed and read nightly.  Looking back, remembering that as one grows older, we change. We need to take that into account with our significant others. It's something I shall never forget again. Mr. Chapman has helped me see myself as well as my needs and the needs of my husband.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|\\"Men In Black\\" is one of those very fun movies that can be watched over and over, and we just re-watched this before heading out to see the new \\"Men In Black 3\\" movie.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me; The story is centers on \\"J\\" (Will Smith), NYPD detective and a newly recruited Agent to a top secret organization responsible for monitoring Aliens (as in from outer space) living on Earth. As might be expected, \\"J\\" brings a fresh attitude to the relatively stodgy establishment, including Agent \\"K\\" (Tommy Lee Jones) and the leader, Agent \\"Z\\" (Rip Torn). I liked that the pace of the movie was not overly rushed and they gave time for the characters to develop an on screen chemistry. The special effects were also quite good, considering when this movie was made.<br /><br />My whole family really enjoys this one!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B0061IMJBI|5.0|I have nothing but good things to say about this show's ability to entrigue on such a deeper level than your typical flesh eating zombie viewing experience. The depth is in storyline as well as character developement and also a very \\"down to earth\\" realistic approach to a zombie apocalypse and how the world might be if overrun by mindless flesh eaters. All in all I believe any viewer should be able to find interest of some sort in this show, whether it be action and violence or just good old fashioned soap opera drama. Only complaint is that I have to wait for new shows when the season is over. This show is just down right addicting.
B0085T5ASU|4.0|This show has walked a fine line between melodrama and real emotions since the beginning.<br /><br />Emily Van Camp has shown us a very Bruce Wayne / Bat-Man portrayal of the Socialite with a damaged past as well as the Operative who likes to contingency plan all her moves for the Deep Strike while maintaing the adaptability to accept reversals and use them to further her own ends. I didn't expect that but she has shown me she can act both sides of that situation.<br /><br />Victoria as a charactor is somewhat murkier in that she says she loves  a man and actively connives against him. I find her behavior weaker than Emily/Amanda but c'est la guerre.<br /><br />***SPOILERS****<br /><br />I believe it is possible that no one died on that plane. We shall see but it sounds like the kind of mis-direct a Revenge story is famous for doing.<br /><br />Daniel & Ashley are going to hook up and shatter apart at least once.<br /><br />I hope Declan stands strong against the emotional blackmail from Charlotte but he may break down as he is very young and a decent sort himself.<br /><br />Jack & Amanda/Emily are going to blowup at or around the time of birth if she doesn't miscarry but she is so unstable that there is just no way she will be carrying Jack's kid, IMO.<br /><br />Amerikon Initiative is going to be watching Nolan and we know how that is going to turn out...<br /><br />***End of SPOILERS***<br /><br />All In all, I will watch season 2 and hope tha it continues to walk the line and not sucumb to soap opera melodrama.
0345803485|1.0|As my title says, I'm conflicted about this book.  As a published work it's horrible and did not deserve to be published in its current state.  But as fanfiction (which I think most people know this book originally was) it's actually really good.  As a FanFiction and FictionPress reader and writer myself, I can admire what the author has created and yet I've read better, more erotic fanfiction and original work that's still free on those websites right now. I guess I feel cheated that we had to pay for something that was and should have remained free.<br /><br />With regards to the subject matter, I suppose it's the raw fantasy that is drawing all of us women in and we saw that in Twilight too, of course.  We women apparently tend to have a deep seeded desire to be under someone's control, taken care of, and cherished to the point of terror.  I get that.  And yet with this book I found myself bored with this overused sexual dynamic.  I've read it so many times, in so many ways, I don't understand why this poorly written and poorly devised version is so popular.<br /><br />The book wasn't erotic for me either.  The sex was all rather vanilla for me because there are no real BDSM scenes.  I mean, it takes two to tango in that kind of sex play or he's just hitting her. Which I guess it what was happening given how many times she referred to him as hitting her rather than using more sexually charged words.<br /><br />I don't by Christian's conflict either.  Don't touch me but I let myself be not only touched but controlled and punished by an older woman who I still respect.  Was I the only one who wanted Ana to turn the tables on him and bring him back to heel where he apparently belongs?  I would rather have read about Christian and his Mrs. Robinson.  At least that would have been original.  But then again this story wasn't meant to be original.

030746363X|5.0|The Four Hour Body outlines a quite clever alternative to low-carb diets, in that it avoids the direct ketosis of most Atkins-esque diets, and instead bringing about fat loss through carb timing.  This book has the potential to transform your life for the better; all it takes is a can-do mindset.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I love the way Sopie Kinsella writes. She can make the most mundane things fun! Although I expected to laugh during the book, I did not expect to cry- but, I did. Often. The relationship that grew between Lara and her Great Aunt Sadie was lovely. I love Lara's conclusion that we're all twenty-something on the inside no matter how old we are on the outside. I, myself, have always felt twenty-something on the inside and been dismayed to find myself forty-something when I look in the mirror... :(  Really fun, touching book.
B0016OOS16|5.0|Got this to use with 3D modelling software, and CFD software for mechanical engineering degree.<br /><br />Didn't take to long to get used to as it felt quite natural (in terms of motion control) and it did noticeably increase modelling and set-up speeds for all 3D software packages.<br />The greatest difference in speed is noticed when not using the device, as scrambling for the ctrl, shift and alt keys (to change motion control of standard mouse) seems to take forever....<br /><br />The only thing that I do recommend is to download the beta drivers which can be downloaded from their website as the standard drivers lack in customisability (in terms of sensitivity, axis definition and program profiles)

1439153663|4.0|As much as I'd like to give Kathleen Grissom's first novel, THE KITCHEN HOUSE, a five-star rating, I'm dragging my feet.  It is well written, has obviously been heavily researched, has characters that seem alive, and is an effort fueled by great devotion.  What's holding me back?  I found it too formulaic and predictable.<br /><br />The story of the slave condition has been told repeatedly through the years, and Grissom doesn't much change the route.  It's an important subject for discussion as long as the elements provide new insight, but there's not much that's fresh here.  There's the faint and delicate white wife who suffers through too many tragedies to see the world clearly.  There's an absentee plantation owner who puts aside family and farm in a distant quest for a hazy goal.  That, of course, leaves the plantation and its slaves in open turmoil because of a sadistic overseer and randy male laborers who intimidate and impregnate the helpless females.  Of course the owner has his own way with the black women while his wife turns a blind eye to the results.<br /><br />There are beatings, incestuous encounters, murders, and forced starvation, all elements found in abundance in the history of slavery.  There are also, in Grissom's book, kindly elders who try to keep relationships cordial and familial ties bound together, but find good intentions are unable to cope with the reality of a savage atmosphere.  The author does not produce lurid or overly graphic details in her writing, a welcome change to some earlier renditions of the slavery story, but that makes the overall atmosphere, while threatening, somewhat tepid.<br /><br />I finished the book because the author was able to keep me interested in her well-defined cast of characters.  The concept of a white indentured servant coexisting with black slaves, and being accepted into both the white and black family structure, is a new twist on an old story, one that I wanted to follow.  Grissom did a nice job of keeping a complex character structure under control and comprehensible.<br /><br />Most of the readers in my book club thought highly of THE KITCHEN HOUSE and I don't disagree.  The quality of the writing is excellent and the scenes are well constructed.  If it weren't for a rather familiar story I would have rated it a little higher.  But I certainly encourage the reading of the book.  I might be getting too picky in my old age.  You be the judge.<br /><br />Schuyler T Wallace<br />Author of TIN LIZARD TALES

B0006N2EZ0|5.0|The bodyguard plain and simple is a classic love story , that broke racial and socieconomic boundaries. This movie was a favorite griwing uo, along with dirty dancing. The bodyguard however was a journey to humility, Whitney had to come down from the stage and reconnect with eing human agan. I love the dialouge, and the costume she wore. Rip Whitney her voice is what made the movie, some are now considering a true classic and one of the all time greats.
B0009MAP90|5.0|I apologize for taking so long to review this. Yes - the cd came within the time frame. And is in excellent condition. I adore this album and it isn't found singly on his official store - even in costly bundles. So having remembered to look on Amazon I found it right away once I had done a search to find which album title it was. I knew it was either his 1st or Freewheeling. It was his first. It is not an easy search to get this is what I am saying had to google a discography on the net to find the songs I wanted to match the picture; which is all the official store had. Not for sale. Then I looked on Amazon and got it for cheap!! So happy with it. The songs I love are on this. His 1st album. So honest and Americana that it just reaches back into American music history. Ode to Woody Guthrie; Gospel Plow many more. The best version of House of the Rising Son is his in my opinion. Love the others too - learned the song off the Eric Burdon and the Animals hit but when I worked in the music dept of our big library downtown decades ago they had albums to lend. Mostly classical but folk jazz blues etc historic stuff, opera and musicals even spoken. They had all of Bob Dylan's til that time - '66. I found these to be so amazing then and loved this one in particular.<br />So - the shipment was swift and it was easy to see it was packaged adequately and I could play it right away. Of course you have to get everything ready so you can enjoy finally hearing something you couldn't find it's a real treat.<br />this album is so authentic with such a true deliverance of good music that it has a healing settling soothing righting effect.<br />Thank you very much.<br />This isn't my first and it isn't my last cd purchase on Amazon. I go by customer ratings and location but our nation's mailing system is pretty easy to count on from where I live I have even been shipped and received from the NE in the middle of a snowstorm 10' high just as easily as from the next state.<br />Thank you very much.u very much.

Wonderful acting, terrific atmosphere, Martin Freeman superb as always. Looking forward to the next series!
B002NZK5TG|3.0|My 7-year boy did not like this film because he did not like the female lead (sorry, Ellen Greene).  Of course, his response is based on her annoying speaking voice.  When he is older, and learns to truly appreciate cleavage, he will perhaps change his mind.  I on the other hand, appreciate the film's attempts at comedy and as a metaphor for the corrupting, ravenous effects of the human desires for power, wealth, and fame.  The scene between a sadistic dentist (Steve Martin) and his new masochistic patient (Bill Murray) is an under-watched classic.  I'd link the clip here, but Amazon doesn't like it when I do that.
0756407125|3.0|Spoiler alert<br /><br />OK ok kvothe is at the university, researching stuff and oh no malfeasance! Ok cool his relationship with Auri deepens while Devi burns her way across the pages. Nice. Nice. Ok at what point does kvothe start giving anything back too his  friends for all the favors and dedication they show him? Ohh right they're just lucky to b friends with a guy this cool.  Ok sure whatever. He goes to meet the Maer. Very nice. Court intrigue and secrets and stuff. Not bad. OK wtf. Denna is a vigilante assassin? Is that what I just f-ing read? She sneaks through the night listening for cries of distress from teenage whores who are getting rough treatment from their customer? She then swoops in and saves them and talks them through their life like some Batman/Dr. Phil mix? Just wtf is this???? Ok f-ing whatever.  Now it's time to chase bandits. Find their camp and Kvothe pulls some bad-ass sadistic magic from the sky. Pretty cool.  Time to go back to the Maer and get sum just  desserts. Oh wait never mind.  Rothfuss uses deus ex machina!  It's not very effective.  Time for tedious sophomoric sexual romp with no-personality magic forest vixen. Hey, kvothe went there to learn uh....... Magic! That's it! That was the reason he chased the naked woman!  Huh huh. She said 'magic.' OK enough of this nonsense. We get it. Felurian is a nympho.<br />Does the story get better after this? Almost. Oh wait. Nm. Spoke to soon.<br />Now Kvothe is learning to be a freaking -ninja-??!?!? Are you freaking kidding me???? A ninja that sleeps with every woman who lays eyes on him while Rothfuss is too distracted by all the naked chicks too be even mildly consistent with his explanations of Adem culture.<br />Oh god the whole thing is just a train wreck at this point.<br />hey and for those that missed it, Denna is the archetypal 'girl stuck in bad relationship cause of self-esteem issues.'  When did she get self esteem issues? Didn't she supposedly wrap every man in a 500 mile radius around her finger with her wit and charm and beauty and amazing talent etc etc etc whatever while she used them to get what she wanted?  You know, when she's not busy moonlighting as Batman. Just wtf. What a stupid character.  OK we get it. She know Yllish knots. She's needed for the story so she can read the magic box and die tragically when it's opened.  Good. Can't wait.<br />While I was busy talking Kvothe made it back to Vintas. Ok maybe now something will happen again.  Nope. Kvothe acts like an idiot. Funny how he only has amazing self-control when it's convenient for the story. Oh sorry did I call B___s___ on all the contrived plot devices? How terribly rude of me.  Ok back to the university...... Wait a minute. I'm almost at the end of the book... AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.  Just....... Wtf!!!?!?!?  Name of the Wind had me in tears when he played the lute in the forest. Again in Tarbean.  My pulse raced and I gasped in fear when his string broke in the Elonian.  NOTW had a few rough patches but as a whole was utterly engrossing and captivating. So then... Wtf is this crap?!?!  This isn't Harry Potter and the protagonist isn't in elementary school so why do I feel that Elementary School Harry Potter did a better job of focusing on the big picture than a freaking hyper-intelligent almost adult!?!?!  Why do I keep hearing about his stupid feud with Ambrose like it's worth the hundreds of pages it's taken up at this point??? Why does Kvothe have the time.. Or even -care- enough to spend hours in taverns listening to stories about -himself-!?!?!? Wtf is this nonsense?!?!?!  Ugh.. Just.... Wtf!!!!

B0059XTUB8|4.0|.<br /><br />Who ever understood Marilyn Monroe?  She became a movie \\"goddess\\" but was unhappy in life and never felt accepted for herself.  My Week With Marlyn explores the most famous woman of the mid 20th century, her feelings and her craft.<br /><br />The movie highlights one week during the filming of \\"The Prince and the Showgirl,\\" staring Sir Laurence Olivier, Marilyn Monroe, and Dame Sybil Thorndike.  The movie  was to be Sir Laurence's film triumph and Marilyn debut as a serious actress.  The methods of Olivier and Monroe clashed, so the set was destined to be tense.<br /><br />\\"My Week\\" is essentially a love story.  Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) a young assistant new to films is smitten with Marilyn.  Marilyn struggles with psychological problems from her youth.  Eddie reaches out to Marlyn and tries to comfort her and listen to her fits of fear stimulated by a low self image.  They become friends.<br /><br />To me the best part of this movie is the acting.  Michelle Williams is outstanding as Marilyn.  Williams captures the internal struggles Monroe lived.  Williams is a believable Monroe who portrays her loneliness, frustration and insecurities.  She shows Marilyn's escapism to a fun self in an attempt to combat her emotions.  Somehow Williams senses that Marilyn Monroe is simply a character that Norma Jeane Mortensen Baker (Marilyn's birth name) sees as a role she projects to the public.<br /><br />Redmayne portrays well  Colin Clark, the love struck boy who somehow is blessed with being able to understand Marilyn and provide her the friend she needs.  Judi Dench is brilliant as Dame Sybil Thorndike, and Emma Watson is delightful as Lucy.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film.  I recommend My Week with Marlyn for a nice evenings  entertainment.

B007PS0X0W|3.0|For the 4th installment of this franchise, the action was pretty over the top. It must have looked good in 3D, which is why some of it was shot the way it was. But it had a surprisingly weak script, really didn't develop much. It felt like a really long TV episode of a sci-fi show than a movie. Not to mention it was also rather predictable. Also, the Lycan - were they immune to silver or not? Obviously a set up for a 5th, but a fun ride none the less, even as mindless as it was.

0345803507|2.0|As an avid reader, I'm willing to give all books a chance. I gave this entire series a chance, hoping that the writing would improve as I turned the pages. I was hopelessly wrong.<br />The plot of the stories are okay...nothing to write home about, but entertaining enough when laying in bed at night with a bag of chips next to me.<br />Why women find a controlling, masochistic man so appealing is beyond me. A grown woman Ana is, and yet she is controlled by a man (who is 50 shades of this and that) who uses his good looks and erotic tendencies to seduce the will right out if her. While this is fine on paper, I'd be running for the hills if my husband was anything like that.<br />Plot complaints aside, the author of this series is a laughable excuse for a writer. These books are so long because the repetitive nature of them means more pages. \\"Inner goddess\\", \\"subconcious,\\" \\"Please,\\" \\"Oh my...\\"<br />We get it. He's good looking. We get it, Ana is able to orgasm as freely as she breathes air. Why aren't these books in the fantasy section of the store?<br />And also, a note to the author...using a thesaurus to use complicated words does not make your writing sound better, and it certainly doesn't give you more credit as a professional. It simply makes you seem as though you are using the most inane words possible to make your readers scratch their heads. No flow.<br />Again, while I found the writing so terrible, I feel as though this series is worth two stars because I was mildly entertained in the depth of night. Had this book been handed to me when I was fully awake, it would've found a good home in the trash.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was a bit hesitant about getting this book because it seemed everybody was reading this erotic book and it was so erotic and forbidden, the likes we've never seen. It was credited with putting the zing back into stale relationships.I invested $10 so I could see for myself what all the excitement was about. I've always been a fan of erotic literature.  That is, erotic literature that contains a story line. I found so many things in this book just so unbelievable!  This really  interfered with my read!  It starts with this rather shy/withdrawn girl who is fully committed to finishing college and starting a new career.  Ana (the main character)has \\"0\\" sexual experience.  She meets (by chance) a mind blowing handsome billionaire in his 20's who falls instantly for her, and her for him.  First thing unbelievable is - how many 20-somethings in this world are billionaires?  Then the sex starts.  The sex scenes are tastefully written and there is no real vulgarity at all.  Christian (Grey) takes it slow for the 1st time, then,it's no holds barred!  They are having all kinds of sex. Christian as it turns out is big time into S&M. Being a Woman myself, I just find all this a little hard to buy!  She is suddenly doing everything imaginable with Christian. Remember,it's her 1st experience of any kind and she is in her early 20's. These things, along with the frequency of the sex tended to make the read unbelievable. The actual story line (what little of it there is), is amazingly interesting.  This book leaves the reader anxious to get to the next page and see what secrets Christian is willing to reveal about himself to explain why he is so messed up.  I found myself actually skipping over the sex scenes (I know, right?) to get to the storyline!  This book had the potential to be really good, but along with the aforementioned items, it's just too much!  However, I am kinda curious about the second and third books, hopefully it's explained why Christian is so screwed-up.  I would also be interested to see where the Christian/Ana relationship ends up.
B004H1U2HE|5.0|I loved this book which was both a personal and historic tale.  Although at times it was quite humorous I cried openly at the very end.  Amos Oz struggles his whole life with the death of his mother and I think writing these memoirs was a cathartic experience for him.  A superb writer, I highly recommend this book.
0345803485|2.0|I had heard so much about this book from friends that I decided to pick it up at a recent trip to Costco. Not only did I have to force myself to finish it, but getting through each chapter felt like a 'copy & paste', or at least the sex scenes felt that way. Too much repetition and not enough character for my taste. Had the book been written from Christian Grey's point of view, maybe we could have gotten a better glimpse of who he was and actually cared about his character. But I just didn't like him and didn't find myself wondering why he was the way he was. I simply didn't care enough.<br /><br />Not only did the author fail to get me to care about Mr. Grey, but Anastasia irritated me to no end. It just felt like it was written by a YA author, trying to go for a 20-something crowd. I read the marketing for this book and was shocked to read that it was marketed to an 'older woman' crowd. I'm 47 and I was bored with this. And they are also marketing this as erotica? Hardly. It was descriptive in a juvenile way in my opinion, but not even close to erotica.

B005LAIGPA|4.0|CHRONICLE is a modern-day variation on familiar themes, a CARRIE-like parable of a gifted teen whose newly-acquired telekinetic powers go from harmless pranks to destructive violence.<br />CHRONICLE is another in the ever-growing \\"filmed from a camera's perspective\\" but thankfully not a true \\"found footage\\" flick.<br />Considering the movie's modest budget, most of the effects are fairly impressive.  While CHRONICLE's furious climax is overwrought, it provides a satisfactory resolution.  Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan are obviously in their twenties, but fare well in their character's interactions.  Michael Kelly overdoes his abusive father role, but seems appropriate for the film's overall tone.<br />I enjoyed CHRONICLE's fantasy world, but like the clouds the boys fly through, it's ultimately lightweight fare.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Lame, contrived. Wish fantasy nonsense.  Ridiculous premise,  I read this because it was #1 on Amazon so shame on me for following the crowd.

B0071BY1T2|5.0|Flawless performance by the master and his band. Despite his mind-bending technical abilities his playing seems even more lyrical, more than what one can say about most of his \\"high speed\\" contemporaries, especially in the Metal genre where the boys just rip off endless arpeggios. Sound quality excellent and cameral work gives one a good picture of what's going on. The latest issue of \\"Guitar Player\\" has an interview with Joe about the DVD. Two possibly interesting factoids: He was eager to work with the brothers Lamoureux, but was a bit bummed out by the size of the stage (small), although it doesn't appear cramped. Because this was filmed in 3D, camera angles and the positioning of the players had to be tightly controlled to avoid articfacts, and he couldn't do things like point his guitar at the camera. Hence, there are only a few camera angles used and the boys don't move around a whole lot on stage, but that's OK as there is still ample coverage of what's going on and this set up is probably preferable to some concert videos where the camera bounces around every few seconds for some new shot.<br /><br />One word of warning about the DVD: The Blu-Ray version is advertised as either 2D or 3D. I don't have 3D and this DVD wouldn't load. Amazon sent me a replacement; same story, wouldn't load. I got the non-Blu-Ray version ($1.00 cheaper) and it works fine. Problem might be at my end as I've had some 2D Blu-Rays that wouldn't load, and I've been through 3 different DVD players in the last year. (Even weirder, I've got a Stevie Vai concert that used to play, now it won't - go figure.)<br /><br />All-in-all, one of Joe's best performances backed by a great band. I thought this version of \\"Crystal Planet\\" was a bit strange, but \\"Why\\" just blew me away. If you like Satriani you gotta own this DVD.

0307716546|5.0|On a what appears to be an ordinary day, Grace Covey is attending an event at her son's school, while her daughter is working inside.  When she sees smoke from inside the school, she is relieved that her son is safe, but realizes her daughter is inside, and is critically injured when dashes inside to rescue her.<br /><br />Awakening in a limbo-state, Grace observes her body in a coma, discovers that her daughter is severely injured and is also in limbo, and, over the course of the next several days, realizes that the fire might not have been an accident - and her daughter's life may still be in danger.<br /><br />I found this novel to be extremely gripping and moving, seamlessly transitioning between the criminal investigation (conducted by Grace's quietly heroic sister-in-law, Sarah), Grace and Jenny's status; Grace's concern for her husband and son, and her own period of self-reflection, enforced by her physical limitations.  Some may find her self-reflection tedious and drawn out - I felt it added emotional context and depth to the story.  The ending was among the most compelling I have read.  I literally could not put the book down.<br /><br />This was a well-written, tightly plotted deeply engaging book.  I will definitely seek out \\"Sister\\" and read future volumes by this author.

0143121006|5.0|This book should be placed on the best-written historical thrillers of the year.<br />I will not repeat the contents of it; others have done so before me. I do want to emphasize that to write such a non-fiction thriller is not easy at all and the author has to reconstruct things like a jigsaw puzzle. If you take the thirties, decadent China and Peking, intrigues, lies, murders, coppers, opium deens and prostitution halls, corruption and detective methods-all these make up the menu of one of the best thrillers that have ever been written in the style of Agatha Christie and the Film Noire. A colossal achievement. All thriller writers, please beware :there is a newcomer in this game and his name is Paul French. The only difference is that he writes about crimes that did happen in reality. We want more, Mr. French!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book it is a must read. The writing is exceptional. Which it is to be expected from the writer of the Hunger Games. It leaves you wanting more.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book was supposed to be erotic, hot & steamy type - but it didn't strike me as that partly because of the obvious similarity to Twilight.  The writing style from Ana's perspective was too distracting for it to become too erotic - & I meant that in a good way.  In my opinion, her reaction to the things she saw & experienced for the first time was normal for a young girl her age.  It was like reading Ana's journals instead of a novel.  The writing was obviously not properly edited - which was good in a way.  EXCEPT - the subconscious & inner goddess are SO unnecessary (that's why I only gave 3 stars).  I enjoyed reading the story but it would have been better without the constant reference to those 2 imaginary characters in Ana's head.  They are so annoying and with full description like half-moon glasses reading some classic, lotus pose, jumping up & down etc was so tiresome.  Maybe if this book was properly edited, they will probably be cut out or at least not mentioned as much.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was an awesome ending to a great trilogy. The characters are heartwarming and you want so desperatly for them all to survive but as you know that cannot be. Don't miss this last book of The Hunger Games trilogy.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|Funny, great sound, adventurous for kids. Highly recommend for kids or family nights to watch.  Very entertaining,  would recommend to anyone who likes the chipmunks.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|With just about everyone on the plane and at the pool reading this book I had to give it a try.  I could not put it down.  HOWEVER,  it  is much too violent for children.  The premise of children killing children desensitizes young minds and reminds me of the senseless killings between gang members.  It is as bad an influence as violent  video games.  Also, it promotes an anti-authority viewpoint reminiscent of the 60's and the current anarchist movement.  With that caveat I must say that, as a mature adult, I found it a fast-paced, original work and was even impressed with the resilience of its lead female character.  Recommend for adults only.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|The game is fun, easy to do and is good for school age children as well as adults.  Even my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter likes to play it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an easy read and full of excitement.  The characters are so well thought out.  Terrific book and one of the best in the trilogy. It totally leaves it open for more.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is simply brilliant. It is challenging and extremely fun. I love puzzle/logic games, and this one is way up there with my favorites!
B007G3H8Y0|3.0|I've loved Train since \\"Meet Virginia.\\" I've always loved their tunes, their silly lyrics, and overall style. I'm the one standing at the Fillmore 6 hours before the show starts so I can be in the front row. I've caught guitar pics, thousands of up-close shots, a photo of Pat with me and my friends, been personally crooned to with his arm around me, met Pat in person. I love Train. I am Train's number one fan. I go weeks without listening to anyone else, and they're the only band I can listen to while studying.<br /><br />I love Train and I **do not** love this album. I'm not even sure I like this album.<br /><br />Prior to \\"California 37,\\" iTunes informs me that I've only given two of their songs a rating of fewer than 4 stars. (\\"Idaho\\" and \\"Heavy,\\" for those wondering.) \\"California 37\\" has 5 songs that rate under 4 stars for me. There are only 11 songs on the disc. I've gone back and changed ratings a few times as I hear things differently, so this was not a 'first impression' rating.<br /><br />Sure, Train has changed. I went with Pat's solo stuff, actually I really liked it. I went with \\"Save Me San Francisco,\\" even though not all of the album is my favorite, I still really like it overall. This? What is this? I sat through a law school exam on April 17, barely able to contain myself, anxious to finish so that I could buy the album, and this is what I get?<br /><br />This'll Be My Year: too name-droppy. I really like the song overall, but it's too name-droppy. You've got a captive audience. Who are you trying to impress?<br /><br />Drive By: the single. When this came out, I said \\"if this were by anyone but Train, I would hate it.\\" I stand by that. However, it is an excellent running song.<br /><br />Feels Good At First: the closest to 'real' Train on this album. This feels like a more advanced version of something off of \\"Drops,\\" and I really like it. By far my favorite.<br /><br />Bruises: meh. What is this, Crossroads? Too mainstream, too country-sounding. Ilike country music, but not from Train.<br /><br />50 Ways to Say Goodbye: another running song. The lyrics remind me a little of \\"All American Girl,\\" but poppier. Good for running though.<br /><br />You Can Finally Meet My Mom: another name-dropper. Why? Just why? Shakespeare is timeless because he did not include many references to pop culture in his works. This song is the complete opposite of timeless.<br /><br />Sing Together: fun, catchy. I don't have many complaints about this one, though I wouldn't say it ranks as high for me as the earlier stuff.<br /><br />Mermaid: sounds like they're pandering to teenage girls. I hate this song, hate the lyrics. I tried to listen to it to give it time to grow on me, but after 20 seconds I'm cringing. The chorus bothers me the most. I gave it 1 star on iTunes, I'd give it 0 if I could. The only Train song on my iTunes with skips, and by far the least-played song.<br /><br />California 37: edgy, which I'm typically inclined to steer away from, but I feel like it's done well here. I do not appreciate the degrading line toward women, but I do think there are other good lines. Also, can someone clear it up for me: is Heaven's door Vallejo or Novato? I can't figure out if he took 37 east or west.<br /><br />We Were Made For This: no bones, but it doesn't stand out to me.<br /><br />When The Fog Rolls In: okay, here we go. Probably my second favorite track. THIS feels like the Train I love. Nearly as much heartbreak as \\"Something More,\\" and a great use of piano.<br /><br />Overall... Not the album I was hoping for nor expecting. Maybe next time.
B007JMW46U|5.0|While I highly recommend [[ASIN:B005HJU7HA THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE COMPLETE TALES OF TERROR AND MYSTERY (All Sherlock Holmes Stories and All 12 Tales of Mystery in a Single Volume!) ... Conan Doyle   The Complete Works Collection)]] as it is all of the Holmes stories for 99 cents, grab this volume in addition as you get over 100 of the original Paget illustrations as a companion.  The Illustrated Sherlock Holmes was free when I got it, so this was a no-brainer pick up for me.  The Paget drawings are classic and timeless, and really established who Sherlock Holmes was in the eyes of his legion of fans.

B006C45CFG|4.0|An original twist on the western and sci-fi genres.  This movie was better than the reviews it got.  Unbelievable, but fun to watch.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It's a great idea! Its very addictive to go back and forth between random people. But there are some issues with the free version:<br /><br /> - The ads are super-annoying. Moreso than most free apps. Video trailers pop up after almost every turn. Super annoying.<br /> - There are not that many words. I've drawn a baseball at least ten times in the last two days.<br /> - The Kindle will not turn off on its own if this game is running. Mine sat there for over an hour before I noticed it did not turn off. Big battery drain.<br /> - This is not the developer's fault, but people can be total morons sometimes. It's called Draw Something, not Write Something. It would be nice to be able to quit a match when someone stops trying.<br /><br />Other than, it's a fun idea. Here's hoping improvements come in the future.

B000AOEMXM|1.0|The vast majority of the Star Trek: Enterprise episodes are boring, predictable, and stupid. There is no character development. In the original Star Trek series, Captain Kirk is polite and respectful to his crew, and the crew follows him loyally. Unfortunately, Captain Archer is completely different than Captain Kirk. Captain Archer is arrogant, rude, annoying, and insulting to his senior officers. He constantly endangers the lives of his crew, and when his senior officers disagree with him, he acts like a child. There is a senior Vulcan officer on Enterprise, but Archer never listens to anything she says, even though she has many more years of experience than he has. During the first episode, the Vulcans said that humans weren't ready for space travel, and they were correct. During their first year in space, Archer managed to get the crew involved in armed conflicts with more than 10 different species. That is terrible leadership. Watching an episode in which the humans make mistake after mistake is very annoying and non-entertaining. UPN cancelled Enterprise after the fourth season, and they made the correct decision.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|My new favorite game. Makes you think. Some are hard to figure out, but once you get the hang of it, it'll be easier.

B006T3RM08|5.0|maybe there were teething problems with earlier versions, but this has worked perfectly for me.  Have had it about 2 months.  NEVER an issue with track pad clicking/sticking, very solid and well finished. Works extremely well, recommended highly
1613821816|5.0|This story in fact is a scientific fiction, because the change of personality and appearance was due to chemical substances. However, this is not a simple scientific fiction because it reveals the double characters in human life: a well-respected doctor could have some evil thoughts in his mind and behaved differently.<br /><br />On the other hand, the author did not mention why Dr. Jekyll wanted to do such horrible experiment to ruin himself completely. Perhaps this is the point that needs to explore.

AWESOME~! ;D &lt;- tear of joy
B007HO392S|4.0|Carrie Underwood releases her fourth studio effort on the support of first single \\"Good Girl,\\" which much like [[ASIN:B002DYJAIY Play On]] lead single balances country and pop. Similarly, [[ASIN:B007HO392S Blown Away]] balances country and pop among other genre influences throughout it duration.  For the most part, Blown Away is a sound effort with abundant enjoyable moments.  There are cuts that are flawed and lack the focus and precision of the best cuts, much like many albums these days. A testament to the album itself is the fact that first single \\"Good Girl\\" is not its very strongest cut - there are other standouts alongside that one.<br /><br />\\"Good Girl\\" opens the effort with a nice driving groove and fierce sounding electric guitars.  Carrie sounds incredibly commanding, aided by clear vocal production.  The song is `country' by name mostly, as there is inherent pop sensibilities written all over this cut.  If \\"Good Girl\\" does anything for Underwood, it certainly sheds her `American Idol' image and finds her a more polished performer.  \\"Blow Away,\\" the infamous title track that Underwood performed on Season 11 of American Idol, is less distinct and exciting than \\"Good Girl.\\" Better than her bland take of the song on the broadcast, \\"Blown Away\\" is by no means sub-par, but is lacking in character and development of the very best cuts.  On a positive note, the `four-on-the-floor' pounding beat is desirable as well as vocal production and overall production.<br /><br />The album's best track come through \\"Two Black Cadillacs,\\" a cut that opens with mysterious production and a somewhat understated rhythmic groove. The songwriting and Carrie's vocal performance are amongst their best here.  The refrain screams `country music' all over with its narrative lyrical approach: \\"...and the preacher said he was a good man/and his brother said he was a good friend/but the woman in the two black veils didn't bother to cry...\\"  Add to the clever use of background vocals, and the strength of the cut is further accentuated.  \\"See You Again\\" has a hard act to follow, but does sound job by contrasting the country-laden \\"Two Black Cadillacs\\" in favor of a more crossover-leaning cut.  The refrain is epic and big in sound and the production top-rate intact with pedal steel, guitars, and piano.  The tender bridge contrasts the somewhat predictable verses adding some variety to the cut.<br /><br />\\"Do You Think About Me\\" stands out more than \\"See You Again,\\" contributing a folksy-country sound.  The four-on-the-floor thud definitely adds a `plus' to this cut, as does Underwood's strong vocal prowess on the refrain. If a quibble was to be issued, it would be \\"Do You Think About Me\\" is predictable.  \\"Forever Changed\\" is yet another contrast, finding Underwood aiming for more `tender' approach.  The results are a sound that is quite understated and lovely, though not particularly exciting.  \\"Nobody Ever Told You\\" accelerates the tempo predictably, but does feature some excellent musical touches.  The main rub with \\"Nobody...\\" would be that the music drags on a bit too long.<br /><br />\\"One Way Ticket\\" has a lazy feel about the groove, not to mention the use of whistles throughout, which makes it sort of captivating.  Overall well produced, Underwood shines, particularly on the gargantuan refrain.  A bit gimmicky for the country singer, \\"One Way Ticket\\" is easily more successful than not ultimately.  \\"Thank God For Hometowns,\\" a `B' cut unsurprisingly slackens the tempo.  It opens initially without percussive accompaniment with a groove finally entering in subtly; by the second iteration of the chorus the cut becomes more involved musically. \\"Good in Goodbye\\" is solid, though not the most exciting showing while \\"Leave Love Alone\\" feels as if it lacks `substance.' That is not to say it is `bad' or `inappropriate,' but \\"Leave Love Alone\\" feels as if it needs more lyrics or quality songwriting for whatever reason.<br /><br />After a slight `fall-off,' the superb \\"Cupid's Got A Shotgun\\" resurrects any conceded momentum.  The uptempo cut instantly captures one attention with its overt country sound, which fits Underwood perfectly.  The instrumental jam session only adds to the authenticity placing this cut in the upper echelon.  \\"Wine After Whiskey\\" is none too shabby as a penultimate cut, though not the `best of the best.'  \\"Who Are You\\" features a casual, driving country sound to close out the effort.<br /><br />Overall,  [[ASIN:B007HO392S Blown Away]] attempts to please both the country and pop worlds.  Aside from \\"Good Girl,\\" some of the best moments of Blown Away are the more overt country turns.  \\"Two Black Cadillacs\\" and \\"Cupid's Got A Shotgun\\" are easily two of Underwood's best songs she's released and both are non-concessions to pop or country-pop.  For the most part, Blown Away should please audiences, even when it doesn't `blow you away.'' the superb \\"Cupid's Got A Shotgun\\" resurrects any conceded momentum.

B007OUFESC|2.0|the movie follows the development of freud and jung's relationship over a decade.  the movie nicely depicts the narcissism of freud and his difficulty tolerating anyone who was not an avid admirer or who challenged his beliefs.  unfortunately freud served as model for the development of psychoanalysis.  jung challenged freud and was excommunicated from freud's church.  keira knightly plays a patient of jung's who he stops therapy with and then beds...somewhat similarly  to freud bedding his sister-in-law in terms of boundary violations.  a dangerous method is a good name for remnants of psychoanalysis still in existence.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I am thrilled at the quality of the tunes on Bonnie's newest CD. Million Miles blows me away everytime I listen to it...there's a sweet rawness imbued with a bodacious little slide guitar solo and solid vocals.<br />I've been listening to Ms. Raitt for decades, and today her voice is better than it ever was...smooth, clean, strong, and PURE Bonnie. I heard/saw her in N'awlins a few week-ends ago and was blown away. This CD will not disappoint you if have EVER liked any song she's ever sung. AND her slide guitar chops are outstanding, better than ever.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I won't critique the show because enough people have already.  The DVDs are superb in quality given the source material available.

B007YOC4RW|5.0|I have been following JB for awhile now. He is a player that is at the top of his game. Just phenominal. With every release he has put out, there has always been a track or two that I really liked, but never just fully sucked in. Driving Towards The Daylight, to me, is his best yet. I love it. Followed him earlier and then into Black Country Communion, which I liked, but again fell short for some reason. This is top notch from beginning to end. I have not took time out to check the credits and see who is all onboard with him here, but the vocals are great as well. I seen him on the performace of Freddie King's Going Down on R&R Hall Of Fame along the side of some other greats and it pushed me over the edge to wait for this one. Well worth the wait, which actually was not that long, but sure did seem like it.

B00782O7IY|5.0|this movie seemingly has everything going against it commercially. it is in black and white. it is a silent movie. it has two French actors as leads playing the leads in an american set movie and all the other actors are americans, so why in the heck does it work both artistically and commercially? when i started watching it, knowing it was silent, i figured i was good for about fifteen minutes of it and would then go watch something else with dialogue. instead, i was mesmerized.<br /><br />it is a marvelous film about two movie stars at the end of the silent era and the start of the talkie era. valentine is a huge silent star. one day he meets a young woman while giving an interview and is charmed by her. she ends up in his movie. however, he is married so nothing happens between them. soon, however, the movies change and her star starts to ascend since she can talk and his descends as he stayed with silents, she wants to save him but he is very resistant to being saved. it resembles A Star Is Born but is not a tragedy.<br /><br />this film also has one other huge element for success. there is a jack russell terrier who is the third lead in the show and he almost streals the movie. he does great stuff throughout the movie and i would have watched it for the dog alone.<br /><br />my only quibble is that i think george clooney should have gotten the oscar instead of this actor.  clooney's was a much more difficult role, far more universal, plus brilliantly realized and executed.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B004VYYA2K|5.0|We bought this as well as some more Barbie dolls for a sweet little 4 year old Barbie fan. I love storage items that can do double-duty and was intrigued by the fact that not only was this a storage bin for her Barbies, but that it also could be unzipped and converted into a playmat of sorts for pretend play. Our young friend has enjoyed this as her little Barbie playmat, and her Mom has enjoyed the fact that this is a fun-looking (lidded) storage bin for easy clean-up, and capable of holding several Barbies and accessories when play time is over.<br /><br />The zippers are well-made, but younger children may require some assistance to help get this properly zipped up, at least until they get the hang of it. The box and lid are suprisingly sturdy to hold up to normal wear and tear, but not to put any great weight on the top of the zipped-up box. I like that all of the surfaces are easily wipe-able and the box itself is cute enough to leave out in the child's bedroom or play area.<br /><br />This Barbie ZipBin as a playmat is fun for younger children as well as useful for keeping their Barbie toys put away neatly. It was a good purchase, I'm glad I bought it.
0345803493|5.0|Christian Grey wants to unlock the truth, not only of Anastasia, but himself as well. So once again, what is truth? That is a simple question, yet the answer can be such a fleeting thing once the quest is set upon to discover and unravel the very nature of truth. Often one door opens another and yet another for the seeker of truth. As one woman seeks to unravel the truth of a man, she may learn that such an undertaking may lead to avenues and corridors often left in the shadows, often only whispered about. But, who is the actual seeker here? As she sets upon this quest what does she in turn reveal about her true desires, her true passions, her true nature that even she is unaware of? He sees. He seeks. She is the vessel of his quest. He unravels the truth in her petal by petal. Once laid bare, ultimately what lies at the heart of her true nature? These are passionately intriguing questions. There are many layers to truth and trying to define truth can be such a perilous venture to set about. As red as a room can get, Christians uniquely envisioned passion probes deeper into this flower. What do its petals hold? The journey can be a painful one. How deep must he probe? Indeed.

The cable storage solutions are awesome.  It has a mounting point for 2.5\\" ssd and the included clips for your 3.5\\" hard drives are great as well.  This thing will hold up to a 12.5\\" video card as well.  Plenty of space.  It's wide open all over to allow for great ventilation and it's covered in fan mounts.  Matter of taste here, but I wanted something that wasn't covered in blinking lights and spaceship-looking crap but with a good list of features.  Looks slick and refined with room under the hood for a monster of a system.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Self publishing has been a two edged sword for readers. On one hand...there is a lot of really crappy stuff out there now that anyone and their dog can throw a book up on amazon and get their mom/pet groomer to give it a 5 star review. On the other hand...there are some seriously great books by wonderful authors that never would have even tried under the old publishing model. So I am truly grateful for self publishing and the fact that I was able to read a truly great book like Blood Song.<br /><br />I was honestly surprised by how much I liked this book. It just hit all of the things I love in books and managed to not do any of my pet peeves. It was a perfect storm of a fantasy novel for me.<br /><br />Quick list of things I really liked (spoiler free):<br />1. I like my heroes to be just that...HEROES. I'm not talking good/evil here, but better at whatever it is they do than anybody else.<br />2. Single main character. A lot of books these days follow the RJ or GRRM trend of 10+ main characters to follow. It was nice and refreshing to just have the one.<br />3. Great supporting cast. The character development was great and the supporting cast did just that...added great support to the story.<br /><br />This is one of those books where I would have gladly paid much more than I did and wish I could pay more to support the author. My only recourse now is to buy and give many copies away as gifts. :)
B006ZKCXG8|5.0|The ONLY negative thing I can possibly say is that throwing the \\"air on the g string\\" on at the end of the album seems a little silly, especially since she's recorded it previously.  OTHER THAN THAT, just buy this album already.  Really fantastic arragements, and her Smallman really balances out nicely with the quartet.  Easiest 5 stars ever.
0345803485|1.0|After all the hype and recommendations from friends, I purchased this book.  It took me about 50 pages in to realize I must have very different taste and standards for what I consider to be a good book.  My problem was not at all with the subject matter (BDSM) or the genre (erotica), but instead, with the poor writing. Far too many repeated phrases, overused expressions, unrealistic dialogue and scenarios. Nothing kills a book faster for me than unrealistic or improbable dialogue!! I'm often surprised by what passes as quality.  It drives me nuts knowing that there are far better writers who have written far better books, erotica or otherwise, who have not gotten nearly half the recognition for their efforts that this book/writer has. I'm curious to know how many of the readers who have claimed to enjoy this series would have actually chose to read and praised it so widely were it not such a \\"what's trending now\\" item. For those who were sincerely entertained, glad you enjoyed it ;).  Different strokes for different folks.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|You know already when you walk in, just what you want to see. This movie delivers.<br /><br />We start with the ne'er-do-well soldier about to get drummed out. (You can already see where this is going.) Then, the big space thingie happens. It's now down to our plucky band (plus a few surprise guests) to save the world, which they do. And get the girl, despite getting off to a really bad start. The \\"old guys rule\\" meme comes in late and works well. For purpose of full disclosure, I must admit that I was recently identified by a waiter to my dinner partner as \\"the older gentleman,\\" so I own up to lots of old guy sympathy.<br /><br />Great CGI, massive heroics, lots of genuine US Navy support, a really cute female seaman, and a happy ending. It's all you could hope for from a movie co-produced by the Hasbro toy company. Don't think too much, and you'll love it. I didn't, and I did.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B005LAIHIQ|4.0|The Burton/Depp formula has been tried and proven so many times that it needs no further comment. When you see them pair up, just watch it. This flick meets their finest standards.<br /><br />As a continuation of the original: I wish I could comment, but I never became a fan. But, as entertainment in itself, this offers more laughs than just about anything else in theaters this season. Depp's utterly straight-faced rendering makes the movie, of course. The simian housekeeper has his moments, and the bratty teenage girl comes into her own late in the game. (Hint: when \\"that time of month\\" comes, she has some serious issues around shaving her legs.)<br /><br />Fine, fun, and forgettable entertainment. It has some great lines, it sustains its energy, but I can't say it did much for me the day after I saw it - and that's one big way I evaluate a movie.<br /><br />-- wiredweird<br /><br />Warning: the 1970s tunes that pervade this movie might echo in your mind for weeks. \\"The lion sleeps tonight\\" - arrghh!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Luckily I had book 2 ready to go so that when I finished Fifty Shades of Grey I could continue with this riveting story of love and intrigue - more of the same as the lives of Ana and Christian intermingle and become one - I love it.  Great writing and great characters.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I had seen the author being interviewed on TV and how everyone is raving about it so I bought it on my Kindle. I am not sure what I was expecting but the sex gets quite tedious (although I am now more informed re doms and subs but the vanilla aspects are pretty repetitious and ho hum) and the writing is just okay. However, I found myself getting attached to Anastasia and Christian and wanting to find out how their story unfolds. For this reason, I went on to read book 2 and amd almost through book 3.<br />I think the messed up character of Christian is quite  well developed but Anastasia misses the boat as the petulant virgin(I got tired of her crying and saying he's so hot).  I think a strong woman would have made a more interesting dynamic. I don't watch soap operas but in my mind's eye they are something like the Shades of Grey trilogy.<br />I do not see what all the hype is about. There must be dozens of writers with great manuscripts that can't get a book published and here, this mediocre product is on the best seller list.Go figure.
0374275637|5.0|As a finance practitioner and student of behavioral economics, I could've saved a lot of time reading this book instead of many others.  Kahneman deftly summarizes much of the best thought in the field, which he is well qualified to do as one of the leading researchers in the field.  A must read for anyone who makes decisions about anything.  (So everyone excluding gimps I suppose . . . )
1469984202|4.0|I really like this new series. The description of this 'world' is so unique and detailed. I wasn't as enthused about all the fighting scenes, but life in the silos kept me up late at night. I can't wait to hear more about silo 17 and the outside world. Will people emigrate?  Will they contact the other silos?  You have me wondering!

0446573019|5.0|Here comes John Puller!<br /><br />Puller, the protagonist in David Baldacci's 2011 thriller ZERO DAY, is my new hero.  He's a combat veteran (and former MP) now a military investigator in the U. S. Army's CID - Criminal Investigative Division.<br /><br />The SAC of the CID and a few other military higher-ups have sent Puller solo to a remote part of West Virginia to help the local authorities determine the who and why a family of four have been brutally slaughtered.  By page 116 there are six bodies lying on the floor and one hanging from the rafters.  And Puller has saved the life of Louisa, the old woman who owns Annie's Motel, from the throes of a myocardial infarction. Wow!<br /><br />Puller has also met the local police liasion...a female named Sam Cole. They've only shared crime scene notes, a meal and a few cups of coffee so far.<br /><br />I know, I know...Amazon's most critical reviewer of this book...it's a copy-cat of Lee Child's THE AFFAIR (2011).  But these guys are great storytellers...and we need all the heroes we can get. Besides, Baldacci owes his fans big time for that soapy ONE SUMMER he wrote a couple of summers ago.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  June 15, 2012...I finished ZERO DAY by David Baldacci today.  What a ride!<br /><br />In many ways, I like John Puller better than Jack Reacher.  John is a Warrant Officer: the only Army investigating personnel to be sent on this mission. He's not a loner in real life: he has family ties and stays in touch....an older brother, apparently a nuclear engineer, imprisoned for life for treason...a father with Alzheimer's who served the Army well but never managed to get those stars.  John travels with luggage; he loves cats and takes very good care of his cat AWOL; he drinks Deer Park water and lots of coffee; and he plays well with others and seems to like the ladies.  Besides Sam, the town policewoman...there's a friendly one star general who knew a certain highly classified officer had found \\"something\\" in Drake before he was murdered.<br /><br />Baldacci uses the word \\"gravitas\\" a good bit when describing a few Army personnel Puller encounters on his mission.  Even though I couldn't find the word in my Webster's New Collegiate.....I believe it applies to Puller also.  When he discovers the problem in Drake, West Virginia, he knows how to throw his weight around for backup in a dangerous situation.  The problem, as I had previously thought, is not illegal strip mining! It's a far more serious and potentially dangerous threat to the residents of Drake...some six thousand \\"proud Americans with a little red around the neck.\\"<br /><br />The technology is very accessible...guns and other military \\"stuff.\\"  And Baldacci manages to reach a high tension level in several sections. At 434 pages, this thriller is a bit short for Baldacci, and I have two small complaints that shave that initial five star rating a bit.  One, there are apparently no plans for the author to write another Puller novel...and two, the ending got a little messy.  About twelve pages out, the novel could have ended sadly but with a good resolution.  Baldacci kept tying up loose ends that were not loose!<br /><br />So I guess I'll look forward to another \\"Jack Reacher to the rescue\\" and keep an eye on the best-seller list for another Puller!<br /><br />Jane<br /><br />Comments welcome.before he was murdered.<br /><br />Baldacci uses the word \\"gravitas\\" a good bit when describing a few Army personnel Puller encounters on his mission.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|A fun app with a lot of variety.  I like being able to pick the next game to try once I've earned enough points.  Some of the game controls are not as good as others but that makes it more challenging.  The ads are a bit annoying but easy to bypass.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|I have this app for my Kindle Fire.  I like to read reviews before I download any app.  Thanks to those who shared on how to get out of the game.<br /><br />This game reminds me of Farmville and other games like that.  My only problem with this game is that I can''t visit friend's villages.  It says it has to update the game everytime I try to.  It can be glitchy at times and has crashed a few times.  The game is ok just fix the issue with visiting friend's villages.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|Had Liam Neeson not been in this film, it never would have made it into theaters. That said, I only watched it because I shelled out twenty bucks for the DVD (thinking, as with other Neeson films, that I would watch it more than once, loan it out to family and friends to save THEM the twenty bucks, etc.)  Wrong. About forty minutes into the film, I was so bored I actually walked away from the screen to a) do laundry, b) wash dishes, and c) balance my checkbook. In-between these tasks, I would glance back at the screen, and darned if the scene looked exactly like every other scene before it -- so I wasn't sure if perhaps the film had accidentally been on \\"pause\\" all that time...<br /><br />Of course I MISSED the last 15 seconds of the film while putting the wet laundry into the dryer - and this is crucial - when was the last time you watched a movie (or quasi-watched it like me), and the film didn't actually END?  That is, there was no distinct resolution?  Did he die?  Did the big bad (fake-looking) wolf die?  Was it a draw?  Did they leave the ending unresolved, hoping for a sequel? And last but not least, can I get my twenty bucks back?<br /><br />Gonna sell my DVD on Amazon - and soon, before all the 1 ratings dissuade any and all other potential buyers:)
0385344228|5.0|WOW is the first word that comes to mind after finishing this book. Defending Jacob is definitely NOT what I expected it to be. I was anticipating a somewhat inspirational story of the justice system gone-wrong. The book opens with a teenage boy who accused of murdering a classmate. His father (an Assistant District Attorney, ADA) switches roles to act as a defense counsel for his 'railroaded' and 'falsely accused' son.<br /><br />The book is written from the perspective of Jacob's father Andy Barber (the former ADA) with the storyline and perspective rotating between the past and the present. It's actually somewhat confusing at first. Confusing in the sense that you aren't quite sure what is going on and where the writer is going with that particular set of information. In present form, Andy will reflect on things he should have paid more attention to, and how he wished he could have stopped and derailed what happened in the end. Then the story will switch gears and return to Jacob's murder trial. So, as the reader, you become acutely aware very early on that something bad is on the horizon. Obviously, the assumption is that Jacob will be found guilty in the end. I don't want to include too many spoilers, but there is much more to the story than guilty or not guilty. Frankly, the story bares a candid resemblance to the Casey Anthony saga. Jacob's parents are caught in a media storm and are faced with countless lies and excuses from their only son. Who can they trust? Who are they to believe? Although it is their son who is on trial, they find that they themselves are also on trial. Are they really helping their son by defending him? In the end, everything is lost. Their savings, their reputation in the community, and their prized family, all snatched away in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />The main thing that really stood out to me in this novel was that it offered no ultimate closure. I was left with the impression that either Jacob was one of the most unluckiest teenagers in the world or that he was a wolf in sheep's clothing -- a calculated killer. I found the lack of closure to be a true reflection of many of the cases we see in US courts today. Many families and government officials walk away from cases without the definitive answers they seek. So in that sense, the ending was logical and true the world we live in. On the other hand, I found the end extremely frustrating and undoubtably sad.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is compelling, suspenseful, and heartbreaking ... Undoubtably one of my favorite reads this year.teenagers in the world or that he was a wolf in sheep's clothing -- a calculated killer.

0345803485|1.0|I only actually got about 100 pages into this book until I couldn't take anymore, so I'm not sure if it would be considered fair for me to review it. However, I just have to vent because this book is getting soooo much undeserved publicity! It is honestly the worst written book I have ever read. I can't believe it was even published, to be honest. It is very thinly veiled Twilight fan fiction, as we all know, but I was surprised at some of the similarities. I figured maybe Twilight was just a jumping off point, but no, they are pretty alike as far as characters go.<br /><br />I thought maybe the sex scenes would make the rest of the crappy writing worth it, but after reading the first one, that's when I gave up hope and quit. No, it wasn't \\"kinky\\", but it also wasn't well written or realistic (she's in her 20's and has never masturbated! she still orgasms several times though!) or very sensual.<br /><br />Seriously, it makes me sad this author is making so much money and getting so much attention for a book that is so very, very bad.<br /><br />(P.S. Who was the editor for this thing?? They should be fired.)
B003QP4NPE|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"Daemon\\" and \\"Freedom (TM)\\".  I've recommended them to several of my friends, and they've all enjoyed them, too.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It is hard to reap more praise on this series than the love already shown for it here on Amazon. Suffice to say, it is a best selling e-book, is being released in print, and has been optioned by Ridley Scott. There is a reason for all of this of course, and that is because these books tell an amazing story.<br /><br />Well the setting is technically sci-fi, the label is too restrictive to fully describe and capture the essence of these books. Much like the modern version of Battlestar Galactica was a story of politics and religion that happened to be set against a backdrop of an apocalypse in space, the Wool series is a story of the human spirit dealing with adversity that happens to be set against an apocalypse on earth.<br /><br />What amazed me most about this series was the way it captured amazing maxims of truth about human nature, motivations, and the tension between security and liberty. Pretty heady stuff from a fledgling author self-publishing on Amazon. Make no mistake - the quality of this writing is nothing short of amazing. I kept thinking to myself - \\"I know where this going and what is going on.\\" I was glad to be wrong. Just when you think you got it pegged, you get a surprise. My wife bugged me for over a year to give this a shot and I finally dived into the first 5 set edition in the Omnibus edition over vacation. I couldn't put it down. I was very happy to find out when I finished it that the next set, the Shift series, was available. I immediately dived into Shift, books 1-3. When I just finished that series today, I was happy to see I could pre-order the final novel (Dust) for release (and rapid consumption) on August 27. It was like catching up with a great TV series that was released on DVD. No waiting for seasons, and no loss of momentum, it was bing-reading at its finest.<br /><br />I am not easy to impress. Especially when it comes to books - but this series is the best set of books I have read in years. Don't be put off if you aren't really into sci-fi; this is simply great story-telling.into sci-fi; this is simply great story-telling.

0062060562|1.0|This book was horrible! A complete waste of time. It wasn't written well, I would have guessed a junior in high school wrote it, and it was the same thing over and over and over and over... I even found myself skimming and skipping entire paragraphs. It is beyond my realm of comprehension that people like this book enough to classify it as one of the best books in 2011. I figured out the \\"thrilling ending\\" less than half way through the book. I kept reading hoping it would get better, hoping I'd be proved wrong with a clever, inventive ending. Negative. And the book could have been half as long, what was the point of repeating the story over and over again? I can't stress the repetitive nature enough. Not to mention the countless number of flaws with the story... I've spent the past half an hour cursing myself for wasting my time reading this. I just really don't understand what people see in this??

B003EV6DBM|2.0|I'm thanking myself that I rented this season, as with most series they hit an all time low and Series 5 is defiantly it! I hope season 6 is better, I'm the kind of person who waits until the season comes out and watches it without commercials. I don't have cable or converter I just watch dvds.<br />I haven't seen the older version of Doctor Who but at a friends recommendation (and to understand all of his Doctor Who jokes) I started watching it. I LOVED IT! The first season was okay but by the end I was hooked, I just hated that they changed actors. I ended up LOVING David Tennant! :D So when they changed the guy YET again I figured I could roll with the punches and learn to love the new actor but REALLY? I HATED Matt Smith! The dang hair was RIDICULOUS (with David Tennant it suited him), the suite REALLY didn't work for him (same as the hair!!) but the attitude had really improved BUT the MAN CAN'T ACT!! I either wanted to just turn the TV off or fast forward the episode... which I really didn't want to.<br />And another thing I thought the Doctor HATED guns, yet in this season he picks on up! That's one of the reasons I REALLY loved the show, it wasn't some guy picking up girls and running around chasing monsters with guns. And Amy Pond the new companion WOW... all those SHORT skirts, dresses and inappropriate clothes yuck. I was finding myself wishing (I got the dvd's from the library I don't own them), I could go and get the first, second, third and forth series and watching them. Wishing I could watch Rose, Sara Jane, Martha and Donna!<br />*SPOILERS*<br />And whats up with the season arch this time? I got it by the end of the first episode! And when it was in EVERY episode not only was it a little condescending like I forgot or something but it got REALLY repetitive. Not to mention the dumb story line! A third of the episodes were okay, the others were HORRIBLE like the Weeping Angles one, it started out confusing, got good and got worse. I find myself liking River Song WAY more then Amy Pond, LOVING that end up meeting at odd and totally wrong times.River Song WAY more then Amy Pond, LOVING that end up meeting at odd and totally wrong times.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm not usually a big fan of young adult fiction but I fancied a change from my usual reading fare and decided to see what all the fuss was about The Hunger Games. Well, I most certainly was not disappointed! The Hunger Games is a young adult, science fiction novel by Suzanne Collins and is the first book of the trilogy. It is set in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian, totalitarian state where children are chosen to fight to the death for their lives. The premise of the book is barbaric to say the least; a televised fight to the death for survival. I loved the originality of the plot and how compelling it was to read. I was lost in Katniss' world from the very beginning.<br /><br />The characters were mesmerising and the world which the author created was absolutely addictive. I enjoyed being able to escape into a fantasy land and lose myself there completely for a few hours.<br />I liked Katniss, the main character and admired her constant bravery and courage in her fight for her family's survival and in the face of so much adversity. It was a refreshing change to have such a brave female lead.<br /><br />There are elements of light romance and some humour throughout the book. It is quite gory and graphic in parts, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under twelve or thirteen years of age.<br />The Hunger Games was a gripping read that was full of suspense and drama and I very much look forward to reading the sequel
B00127RAJY|4.0|So I bought this DVD to supplement my other workouts on days I didn't feel like leaving the house or just wanted something lighter. I was wrong about lighter. This workout is killer! I was super sore the next day and have much respect for those that do this for 30 days straight.<br /><br />I will say, if you are on the upper floors of an apartment or home, it may be a problem as there is a lot of jumping and stomping, but I tried to be light on my feet and didn't have any issues.<br /><br />Other than that I would highly recommend this dvd as either a supplement of an actual workout.
B007LE3PXW|4.0|I like my new Madonna album, but when I downloaded it I didn't get my digital booklet! Maybe I did something wrong, but am disappointed not to have received my booklet. If anyone can help me out with this I'd appreciate it very much! Sincerely, Philip
B007IXWL2C|3.0|So, I read the first two books in the trilogy. All the way through, the books were lukewarm, but I felt like the last one was boring. It spend a lot of time with the two main characters discussing a lot of mundane topics. The climax of the story came too early, so the last 10% of the book I was waiting for something else to happen and it really fell flat. This whole series was interesting, but a little PG-13. If you are going to write a novel about S&M, make it about S&M.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. It really pulled me in and I find myself thinking about what it would be like to live in an underground silo every time I go down to the datacenter at my work. There aren't many books that make that kind of impression on me. I can't wait for the next installment!
B002L4QP0M|1.0|not only was the story completely predictable but the author gave away major plot points way earlier then necessary.  I felt the story lacked a lot of supporting detail to really round out the story.  major dissappointment after all the good reviews.  Also felt that there were some major mistakes in the electronic version...words that did not make sense etc...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|so far it is an ok game.  a little bit difficult. and like what every body else says they have really bad controls .
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I like this game, but you can't play some songs on the kindle fire. The kindle can process two touches, when some songs need triple chords.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love everything about this book. I love that there is a female heroine who pulls no punches and has her heart (and head) in the right place. I love that there is a role-reversal with Katniss and Peeta (she's the tough one who has to hunt-gather for her family, he's a baker who has had an easier life). I love that the love triangle between Katniss, Gale, and Peeta is so plausible, and I can understand why she becomes conflicted about who she should choose. The setting is also plausible. Where will our own voyeuristic, scandal-obsessed world be if we lost everything else we are used to? Yes, the Games are brutal, but haven't oppressive governments/dictatorships been known to commit atrocities in the past, for the sake of one person's misguided belief and self-absorption?<br /><br />An amazing beginning to a series we will be talking about for years to come.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|cute game lots of fun but I play on my kindle and cant figure out how to request friends. enjoying the game anyway
B005LAIGPU|1.0|I have to wonder what movie the other reviewers watched, but what I watched stunk.  I drifted out of the living room to clean the garage rather than watch the rest of the movie.  Pretty sad when cleaning the garage is more interesting and entertaining than the movie...<br /><br />Save your money and pass on this one!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|beware this game and (every lava game) is very addictive. You will probably be in denial at first (this game is silly) but the first step is admitting it, then just accept it ;)
0385340540|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. So entertaining and hard to put down. It's so easy to get caught up in the story and the characters and really feel what they are feeling. This story really comes to life. Full of suspense, awesome story.

B007JM4CWY|2.0|I rarely download the free apps of the day but did so with this one because I love logic puzzle games and it intrigued me.  After playing it for a couple of days I've found it to be a really thought-provoking and challenging game.  The rules are very simple to understand (just fill in the right number of boxes in rows and columns) and my eight year-old was able to catch on in just about five minutes on her Fire.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the game is unstable on my Galaxy Nexus.  My Nexus has experienced three hard crashes in the past couple of days while playing the game (just up to level 2.2).  This isn't a force close condition but a complete shut down without any warning.  I haven't been able to figure out the conditions for reproducing the problem but I'm thinking that it may be associated with the accelerometer.  I've never had an app cause a hard crash like that on my Nexus.  At this cost level I think that an app should be flawless.  This one isn't.  I dropped two stars for that reason.<br /><br />That said, I continue to play it and enjoy it.  The crashes are correctable and I hope that the developer will figure it out.  Gameplay could improve, though. I knocked another star off for it.  Folks have complained about how small the squares can be and how difficult it can be to click the correct ones.  You can zoom in with multi-touch to improve usability, but then you often lose sight of the number references on the left side and the top.  It can be difficult to figure out what row or column you're on when you do that.  I might suggest a way frame the zoom to retain the numeric references regardless of your zoom level.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|Read the entire series years ago. Decided to re-read it after seeing the HBO Series and seeing things I didn't remember. The HBO Series is incredible, especially since George R. R. Martin is the Producer and can re-write the story to match TV requirements as necessary. Found that re-reading a story as big as \\"Game of Thrones\\" follows a familiar patern of dozens of ah-hah moments. Moments when you suddenly realize why a character does something strange or seemingly out of character. George has been characterized as the American J. R. R. Tolkien, and I heartily agree that his characters and story line, in the books and on TV match or exceed Tolkien. If you have not read \\"Game of Thrones\\", You have an incredible experiance awaiting you, even if you are watching the TV version on HBO.
B007N0REX6|4.0|i have always loved slash especially in his days with Guns n roses and also the lead singer of alter bridge miles kennedy is freaking awesome and i bought this cd and it was  really good and but i do wish it was alot heavier sounding musically but overall its fantastic and worth it and you wont regret buying it
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The Mockingjay was a very good book. I was pleasently surprised by the turn of events that made this book just as great and exciting to read as the first two.
0345803485|1.0|I should've known anything that was originally a twilight fan fiction would've been this horrible! I liked twilight, I'm not fan girl obsessive but seriously this book is a load of nothing. It was terribly written, I'm pretty sure my 5 year old sister could've written a better book! Apparently this book is considered Smut, yeah okay I'll believe once the editor decides to use a thesaurus and rewrites this crap. I'm pretty \\"Holy Crap!\\" Or \\"Oh my god, I'm biting my lip.\\" Isn't the best dialogue around for a best selling \\"Romance Novel\\" don't waste your money on this!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games is an excellent story, very well written, and is very hard to put down.  There is a great visual picture as you are reading.  Heaven help us if our future really went this way.
B004XS97KO|4.0|I was very happy with Amazon Prime (for almost a month) and enjoyed the Dr. Who series very much - until Season 6, when the videos stopped loading and I was unable to watch the last half of Season 6.  In the words of River Song, \\"Spoilers!\\"  After this, I decided to view \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" and was unable to load that, also.  Now, I'm frustrated and angry and unable to find a way to notify Amazon of my problem .  For these reasons, I would not recommend this service to anyone.  Has anyone else experienced this problem - or can anyone perhaps offer a solution, since it seems not to appear on the HELP menu?<br /><br />I'm very pleased to add an update.  My video loading problem has been resolved - without having to change anything on my computer (and without having to pay the $45 fee that was solicited by the HELP Center) so I am once again a fan of Amazon Prime.  The only change I would like to see initiated is a simple means of reporting a bad link or streaming problem, as this was the most frustrating part of my 'failure to launch' experience.  Thank you, Amazon Prime.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Could believe I didn't pay anything for this great game. I love it. just another reason for my kindle to never leave my hands. The picture quality was amazing.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this helps me stay organized, which I need over the summer,  which I need to keep track of my classes and when orientation starts. I couldn't ask for a better app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty fun game to play when your bored. i play it all the time when i have nothing else to do. and its pretty darn fun.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This sensation will make you fell exhilarating when it finishes concluding into want to seeing it again and again. Great camera work 'cause it makes you feel like your within in a dream within a dream. The acting is great with a great plot. Are you ready to be inside a dreamworld!?!!?!!?
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I had watched the original film and the Tim Burton take on it and had enjoyed both.  When I heard about this film, at first I wasn't too incredibly eager to watch it.  It just didn't capture my attention to much.  But nonetheless I saw it and was blown away.  The film is so much more emotional than I would have ever thought.  It starts by creating a character in this chimp and by halfway through the movie, you feel for him as if he were a real character!  This movie is a triumph in making you feel for Ceaser and in a way rooting on the apes as they begin to take over!  Another triumph of the movie is the CGI, which were breath-taking!  Great acting, script, and cannot wait for the sequel!  I am astounded by this movie and is one of my favorites now!  Even people who have never watched nor cared about the \\"Planet of the Apes\\" series, will find themselves in love with this work of art! And yes, I did tear up a little for a CGI chimp.  See it though! You won't regret it!
B00275EGWY|5.0|Shipping was quite good took them the time I thought it would, The case looked alright, but the Dvd looked Amazing considering I bought it used. I thought it was brand new.<br />All in all a FANTASIC!!! Job and a Good Movie to watch
B0060FXBNM|3.0|Let me start off by saying the trilogy is an awesome one, and happy to add to my blu-ray collection!  Each film kicked butt on the big screen! I give each film a 5/5 also! My 3 star rating is for the set. I bought it knowing it had no special features...but here is my gripe. This set was $40! I wasn't about to pay more for special features even though I wanted them. Good movies, but in my mind, for $40, they should have included each two-disc edition.  There may be one out now, I don't know, but at the time, this was my maximum spending limit.  Just know it is just the movies when you get this!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is easily my favorite game on the kindle fire! I'm completely addicted and it's very easy to lose track of time when your playing. Highly recommend it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was not at all interested in seeing the Hungar Games in the movie theatre but my daughter said it was really a good movie.  So instead I ordered and read the book since our book club chose Hunger Games for our May selection.  I LOVRD it.  Crazy idea, off the wall way out characters in the story but I could not put it down.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|this book touched my heart. it made me laugh, cry, scream and smile. It's so realistic and truthful and I absolutely love it and I plan on reading it at least 10 more times
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Great classic read.  I enjoyed this book decades ago when I was in high school, but enjoyed it even more this time.  I love, love, love my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus - didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I do.  I have always enjoyed reading, but having this has renewed my love of reading!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I was hooked from the very first move. The graphics are crisp and the action is smooth. My wife has this app on her iPad and she just loves to play this game.
B0014KFV6I|4.0|Tapestry  is a wonderful album. It is timeless and Carole King's voice and lyrics have a special quality. I have discovered her by chance from listening to James Taylor and this album does not disappoint. The tracks have both a soulful and a folk quality. I highly recommend Tapestry.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Hello Dick (no pun intended) and Jane!<br />This is the first grade reader of the porn world, a poorly written skeletal story on which to hang (again no pun intended) a series of poorly written sex scenes. Full disclossure. I only got as far as Jane losing her  virginity and I couldn't stand the thought of the  sado masochistic shennanigans to come.  This author, who seems like a perfectly nice woman -  saw her on The View - should be spanked herself.<br />It is on my Kindle and cost 9.99.  How do I get my money back?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|favorite game ever played on my kindle. best game ever played. missions are a bit hard but other than that its awesome
0060751967|5.0|This is one of the funniest Vamp books that I have ever read.  My face was hurting from all the smiling that I did while reading this book, which I did in one sitting!  Check this one out.
