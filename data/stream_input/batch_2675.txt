B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I rented this movie because a few friends of mine, and a teacher, thought it was a great.  I thought it was okay.  The story was a little strange and not what I thought it would be like after watching the trailers, but I did like it in the end.  I didn't think it was as &#34;great&#34; as everyone says it was, but it kept my attention.  It was something totally different than what you would expect.  I like Jamie Foxx in movies and he didn't disappoint.  I was surprised most of the reviews list DiCaprio and Jackson, but omit the main character who is with Foxx most of the movie.  I'm sorry I don't know the actors name.  He did a great job with Foxx and was a main character in almost the entire movie, but they seem to downplay him in the previews and ads.  I'm not sad I paid to rent the movie, but would have been happier if it would have been free on Prime.
B0050AV5MW|4.0|The auther took me on a rollercoaster ride and left me screeming nooo. I need to read more of this.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Truly enjoyed reading this! Very easy reading and filled with amazing facts about Tesla (and many others!). Recommended book. The ending could have done without all the quotes from various famous people.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I spy game is cool have fun playing with my son and Love the skulls are fun to look at
B000OT6V00|4.0|Hellboy is a lot of fun.  The CGI is excellent, and the action is as realistic as hand-to-hand combat between giant, tentacled lizards from hell and a big, red guy with a tail can be.  Hellboy is a hoot, with his ever-present cigar making him seem a blue-collar sort of guy who takes his work as it comes with no complaints.  The idea that shortening his horns will make a big, red guy with a tail and an enormous fist \\"fit in\\" is evidence that even refugees from the netherworld have skewed views of themselves.  Ron Perlman has often been misused throughout his career, but he and Hellboy match up very well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The hilarious presence of the minions and the cameos of the movies characters combined with the fast pace fun action make for an enjoyable experience.
B003V2HWP0|5.0|I had seen this movie years ago and when I watched it again, it didn't is disappoint. It was Beautifully acted .
B005IQZB14|4.0|I've read a lot of hiking books recently and this one was the best.  I heard an interview with her on the radio and was compelled to buy the book.  I then read the entire book from cover to cover in nearly one sitting.<br /><br />If you are looking for a how to walk the Pacific Track with tips and a guide to gear you'll be disappointed.  There is none of that and she says more about what not to pack than what to take.<br /><br />The short story is she lost her mother, split up with her husband and decided to pull her life together with a long walk.<br /><br />It's a brilliant read and really well written.  It's full of interesting people she met and her own experience on the trail.  I loved it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF DIFFICULTY TO BE CHALLENGING BUT NOT FRUSTRATING.  VERY ENGAGING AND ADDICTIVE.  LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|While zombie have been done to undeath, this film provides an interesting twist by having an intelligent zombie as the main character.<br /><br />While the key plot device is rather dubious, the film works quite well as a dark, yet hopeful, romantic comedy.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved loved it! but hate that we have to wait for another book!! It's not a trilogy what so ever
B009I2UH2W|1.0|It's handy and was great the five times I used it. Unfortunately, on the sixth time I plugged my phone in the part that slides into the bottom of the phone just broke off of the charger.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun to play. Easy way to kill time throughout the day. Very imaginative. I like a fun challenge from time to time.
B000005J08|4.0|Long since the source of inspiration behind such promising grind/metal outfits as Psyopus, Leng Tch'e, and Fantomas, John Zorn's Naked City is one extremely experimental musical outfit, one that draws as much influence from the likes of free-jazz, progressive rock, and avant-garde metal than from grindcore. Heck, Zorn even covers composers such as Ennio Morricone, Henry Mancini, Johnny Mandel, Ornette Coleman, Jerry Goldsmith, John Barry, and Georges Delerue on NC's (full-length) debut, 1990's eponymously-entitled \\"Naked City.\\" In other words, JZ takes great pleasure in screwing with the minds of music listeners everywhere.<br /><br />The lead-off track is a big early standout because it marries punk-metal riffs with a soaring saxophone line to create a sound that evokes John Zorn's take on what the \\"Batman\\" theme song should sound like. (Yes, you read that right: the \\"Batman\\" theme! But hey, it's Zorn's band/album, so he can do whatever the Sam hill he pleases!) And a couple of later tracks, including \\"A Shot In The Dark,\\" further this \\"old-timey T.V. show soundtrack\\" vibe. And \\"The Sicilian Clan\\" is another piece of easy-listening pop rock (it actually sounds not unlike the radio-hit \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\"), thanks to its extensive use of cool and jazzy-sounding saxophone soloing. But there are plenty of tunes that launch the listener back to the extreme side of the line, too, including \\"You Will Be Shot.\\" This is a viscerally-satisfying number that careens all over the friggin' map, from full-on metallic riffing to dissonant noisecore to grind to thrash. And it is also filled with noise-derived saxophone squeals and smashing percussion blasts.<br /><br />Elsewhere, another of the record's more noteworthy tracks is the very punky and funky \\"Snagglepuss,\\" which almost comes across sounding like a Primus b-side. (But the keyword there is \\"almost,\\" because \\"Snagglepuss\\" is much more brutal and off-the-rails than anything that that band has ever recorded.) A few of the remaining tracks, like \\"Latin Quarter\\" (a comparatively epic tune, since it clocks in at past four-minutes in length), \\"I Want To Live,\\" and \\"Lonely Woman\\" delve into Fifties-era jazz, with a jazz bar-esque piano line and elegantly jazzy saxophone soloing. But for every moment of breathtaking beauty that is present, here, there is also at least one moment of punishing, unnervingly dissonant brutality. In fact, \\"Naked City\\"'s mid-section is almost pure grindcore, as it is comprised of a string of songs that bring to mind \\"Scum\\"-era Napalm Death. Indeed, \\"Ingenous E,\\" \\"Blood Duster,\\" \\"Hammerhead\\" (which is only a mere eleven seconds deep), \\"Obeah Man,\\" \\"F The Facts,\\" and  the aptly-entitled \\"Speedball\\" are all extremely discordant, frantic, and frenzied blasts of noisegrind overflowing with driving, pummeling grindcore blasts and saxophone squeals. (Also make sure you take note of two of the aforementioned song titles, as the modern-day grindcore bands Blood Duster and F The Facts both got their respective names from these tracks.)<br /><br />But immediately after this slew of uncompromising bludgeons winds to a close, Zorn drops in a piece like \\"Chinatown,\\" which instills a very sharp sense of dynamics and contrast with its very calm, cool, and soothing musicianship. And one more example of the album's more noteworthy tracks is \\"Reanimator,\\" because it features both a drum solo (and a really dexterous and thunderous one, at that), and a piano solo (in its outro).<br /><br />True, \\"Naked City\\" is anything but a normal-sounding and/or commercially-accessible release. But even if you do not walk away from this record humming any memorable melodies or even recalling any of the individual punches that comprised your fifty-three-and-a-half-minute long beat-down, just remember: That is part of what makes this such a genius, innovative, and unique-sounding effort. As such, it should definitely be considered a definite listen for all open-minded music fans, and purveyors of jazz, avant-garde metal, and grindcore. After all, this is one album that is as unpredictable as it is rewarding.eyors of jazz, avant-garde metal, and grindcore. After all, this is one album that is as unpredictable as it is rewarding.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|It's frustrating and fun. Love playing the weekly tournament against my Facebook friends. It just makes it more enjoyable and fun.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|A beautiful read. Beautifully written. The language is a joy to read and the story will make your heart ache.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I really really really like it a lot and I love doing it and I hope everyone likes it lets go.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Though fictional, this story is based on actual events in 20th Century American History. I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about our past social treatment of orphaned children.  It's also an examble of how our society has evolved into programs that still need inproving in the protection of children.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|L don't know how to get out of room.  I find things but don't knowwhat to do with them!!! Please.
B008RJFRTK|4.0|This is a great upgrade from the light version and is particularly helpful when travelling in countries and areas with which the traveller is unfamiliar. I am pleased with its content and precision.
B0061S073A|5.0|Works well, and prevents kids from getting around it. Very impressed! Will certainly recommend to other people with small children.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I hope this new developer continues to create useful little applets like this one. The terms 'feature rich' and 'applet' are by nature at odds with one and another, so it is strange to hear requests for added features to a battery applet.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|When is next book out? Is it already?! I wanna see where Gideon is taking all this?? Are he and Eva making it or is he using her!?
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really enjoy this game because it gives you a chance to get gold by having neighbors who are nice. I just wish that instead of asking around you could see that persons storm8 ID card so you can friend that person right away. or to make it even easier, as soon as you go into someone else's village a friend request would pop up. the game is really entertaining but I don't like the way some of the missions take forever to complete. I have a mission that I have to be level ten to do. when I got the mission I was a level 8. they need to fix that. the missions are easy to understand which is great for the younger kids. I could ramble on all day. lol I better go...
B00AVFO41K|1.0|This product did not load properly and it will not install.  I tried several times and it remains on the install button and will not move.
B001AZFO14|2.0|Too much gratuitous blood and guts with an improbable story line.  Offensive to any real soldiers. Not worth the time to watch it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great app. the puzzles are challenging. I like this a lot more than 100 floors. I do admit to needing to cheat a few times but have always been close definatly a fun time waster
B0018RFLN0|4.0|Tom Cruise does a good job of fulfilling the Mission impossible role.  Lots of action and difficult stunts.  Good fantasy escape for the viewer.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series, I really enjoy the interpersonal relationships and watching a family struggle through the early 20th century. I can't wait for S4.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Same issue reported by other users.  Version 1.9 on Kindle Fire nonHD.  Flipboard worked great on device but later un-installed.  Decided to install app few weeks ago.  App installed OK but when I log in...app says &quot;Signing In&quot; but never completes.  If I close the app and open again it shows me logged in with my Flipboard account but none of my magazine subscriptions.  I am running Flipboard on an Aneroid phone and iPad without any issues...and have been able to re-install Flipboard on both without sign in issues.  Even looked at Kindle install directory to check if previous install left behind cache or other conflicting data but there was no folder or files that remained.  Suspect a problem where uninstall does not properly update operating system or remove all data.  This is a bug in Kindle Fire.  When will it be fixed?
B00B81B0HC|5.0|I love this CD.<br />Radioactive grew in popularity and I just had to listen to the rest of their music. All of the songs are really good and catchy.<br />I got this as an MP3 download because you have it instantly on the computer. It's very convenient.<br /><br />I'd recommend this CD to anyone that likes music. It's just that good.
B004FDPOHC|5.0|This soundtrack is simply incomparable!<br /><br />Epic, mysterious, calm, yet wild.<br /><br />The soundtrack is a mix of emotion. Worth the buy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it! This game is fun and addicting. You won't want to put it down! Minion Rush ftw! Make sure you have plenty of free time
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Season One of Castle is a fun, lighthearted and addictive genre program whose characters tend to grow on you.  It stands out for clever, witty dialog and truly inspired acting.  Unlike older shows along this formula, this one does not reset to zero (like Magnum PI).  There are story arcs that cross episodes and seasons.  Events and relationships generally have meaning.  Start with season one.<br /><br />As of this writing, there are five seasons of Castle on the market and the sixth begins in the coming months.  The show provides an island oasis of smart, sensitive entertainment in a sea of TV drek.<br /><br />The entire cast is outstanding, with such depth and plausibility that you fall into their world with them.  The show is richly with subtext and symbolism, rewarding attentive viewers with layers of meaning.<br /><br />The relationship between Castle and Beckett is witty and clever.  Lots of chuckles arise from their repartee.  It is also tender and moving.<br /><br />This is a funny, intelligent, literate show.  Well worth the time.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|All right so, being the huge SW and LEGO fan that I am, I've decided to pick up this set and give it a go. First of all, the packaging was excellent, so was the service. It arrived quickly and in great shape; exactly what I expected. I actually started on this set the moment it arrived in the mail. Took me around 12 hours to finish it; it looks absolutely great! It's actually quite big, I am still not sure where I'm going to put this set, have to think about this soon haha.<br /><br />I highly recommend this, if you're a SW fan I really think this will be a great addition to your home. Yes, it's THAT big lol.
0345525558|5.0|This book starts out slowly drawing the reader in, and building up the characters. Then unexpectedly you are hooked! I could not put the book down. This story is so touching and close to the heart it cannot be explained... you must read it to find out. :)
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This app closely resembles playing the actual card game. Being a long time OFF player I wish other companies would do something similar for games. The only thing using like is the animation can get a little repetitive.<br /> Other than that this is a great fun game.
B00B81B0HC|4.0|Several songs are really good, good CD to listen to while you are working and several songs are good to play while exercising.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like the game but when I went to to the goals and it said that I have to beat a friend and i have no friends and I cant get one because you know what Gameloft, I DON'T HAVE A FACE BOOK ACCOUNT!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO YOU SHOULD JUST MAKE A BABY CRY AND GET RID OF THE GOAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Since someone saw fit to mess up the weather app on my Fire, I needed another.  The free Weatherbug thought I was located back east when I am actually located in the Pacific northwest.  So I sprung for this app and like it very much.  At least it has my location correct.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|On minion rush i cannot complete the objectives BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A STUPID FRIEND! And i cannot afford to pay for the goal to be cpmpleted
0738737909|5.0|Love at first sight was how I felt when opening the Tarot Illuminati Kit. It arrived in perfect condition, by the way, both the deck and book.  What a truly gorgeous tarot deck.  It's a feast for the eyes!  The book gives good solid information on each card.  It reads like a dream, too.  It all stores in a lovely, sturdy  box that is easy to open.  So happy with my purchase!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Nice variety of relaxing sounds. My personal recipe helps soothe me and makes my usual insomnia easier to overcome. I highly recommend it!
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Overall this is a very good game.<br />Graphics are really nice. 5<br /> System for actual game mechanics is easy to master. 4.5 stars<br />Love all the ways to play: campaign style to sealed deck. 5<br />More in app costs after forking out $10. 1 star<br /><br />The bad<br />Sealed deck has two slots with no way to rest them. Yup, $2 more to open more slots. This really pisses me off. I am ok only getting two slots but at least let me start over when I finish the mini campaign. 1 star<br /><br />New cards you win in campaign mode  are automatically added to your deck. Why? I have to constantly go to deck manager to remove them ever time. They should go into your collection till you want to edit your deck.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to go to this app every day. The updated version doesn't have the hourly, 5 day or other long range forecasts. Also, I don't see the radar choices with cloud cover. There is more, but the annoying scrolling ads are too much. Going to look for a new app for weather!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I picked this up last year while just browsing on Amazon for a book to read.  I was used to reading suspense type books, so this was my first 'contemporary fiction' type book.  I was quickly sucked into the story and found that I couldn't put it down.  Girl falls for a bad body and he falls for her, although she isn't his normal type.  There was one part that seemed a little far fetched, but other than that the book was a good read.  I've already read it quite a few times!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is the first book review I've ever written. I get embarrassed by the cheesy love scenes and women gushing on in romance novels... but this is totally different.  I find myself on every book site imaginable searching for something that tries to hold a candle to Tangled.  No dice. I can't find a book as funny, clever and interesting as this; everything is a major let down after Tangled.  If you liked Beautiful Bastard, Wallbanger (well anything by Alice Clayton really), anything written by Tara Sivec or Kristain Higgins, you'll probably love this.  Don't get me wrong, it's still crass and the sex scenes are still a little embarrassing to me, but I laughed way more than I blushed. This was a book I read in one sitting. As everyone else stated, it's from the guy's point of view and it's very refreshing to have found a book so unique.  The only disappointment is the depression that settles in for having to wait for the sequel and not being able to find something quite like it.  Just going to have to switch genres completely for a while. Trust me, you won't be able to put it down and be prepared to literally laugh out loud, whether you're alone or at work. ;) enjoy, you lucky, lucky readers who haven't read it yet! I'm Jealous with a capital J! :)<br /><br />PS - if you know any books similar, please comment so I can immediately try and pull myself out of this post-Tangled slump. :)
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  For a star, Channing Tatum had very little screen time.  Would like to have seen more of him.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I adore subway surfers. It's fun addicting and you never know what's next!!! What more do you want from a game?? Plus its free! I have no issues but I will appreciate it if I got the new update please... I'm still in Miami... I wanna go to Paris!! I would love that :) Thanks!!
B005LAIII0|4.0|great cinematography,good story line. Enjoyed the format style and story line. Always a delight to get a different view of the world.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Great way to start my day! Quick snippets to increase your knowledge/vocabulary and a history lesson to boot. A must if you want a quick lesson.
B000JMLDCS|3.0|Chesterton never disappoints, I found this book very interesting and a page turner.  I would recommend this to any Chesterton fan or fan of the Classics.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|This was my first time seeing the movie and I really enjoyed it.  The music is wonderful and the cast did an excellent job.  I hope to see the play one day
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this to get an idea of what everyone was talking about. The Plot was okay, the detail, alright, I found the book not worth reading to the end.
B00AB7IA1S|2.0|I tried to play the game but it was upside down. No big deal, right? Wrong. I turned my Kindle so it would be right side up but it flipped. It's stays up side down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can you say about Season 3 other than it is simply amazing.  I love this show and find that every episode makes me get even more interesting in the time period and the lives of the people at Downton.
B000003CM8|5.0|The Allman band was always a favorite. and it's great to listen to like a blast from the past, and it's as good around the second time as it was the first ! Love this band
1452110581|5.0|Bought this for my wife, she loved it, could not stop laughing and point and telling me how much the poems reminded her of our cat.  Great for Cat people.
B009OA57MI|5.0|The thing is...is that to pull out your amo you need to swoop to the left,to have a great landing first put the flaps to half mode and then when you are close to the runway quickly put the flaps to full.And finally to land on an aircraft carrier put the flaps to full decrease thrust all the way down to zero put nose 30 degrees up.And you know how to fly and takeoff so have fun with this app.HAW HAW THIS IS JUST LIKE FSX !

B001NLKXK2|5.0|Story of a woman with alzheimers disease and how it changes her life and everyone in it. The story really hits home to anyone who has lost a loved one to this disease. It is very moving and filled with emotion. Very well written, and I am so glad someone recommended it to me.
B008Y78M60|5.0|Great acting with significant historical subject matter.  Easy for audience to be moved, and get caught up in this well written emotional movie!  I missed this one at the box office, but I would see it again!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|i got this game for my son and he loved it! its hard to find good games for kids!!! i love the facts that it has about the sea!! the best 5 stars!!! :)
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|What a great show that depicts the daily lives of outlaw bikers, and their interaction and support for the community
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I liked the graphics. It was also pretty long for a hidden object game. I think it is a little expensive tho.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I very much enjoyed this series.  The combination of drama and humor coupled with a very interesting and riveting story line kept my attention throughout the shows.  Recommend it to all.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Love this movie! It's really erie how much Zachary Quinto looks like a younger Leonard Nimoy. Opening up this franchise to fresh, new stories by having their destinies changed because of a disruption to the timeline was a stroke of genius.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its great! I had it going with the best horse and lots of saphire attire but theres a glitch that deleting my account, so i had ro start over all the progress. Other then that everything else is fine
B008MIMWOO|5.0|Upon receiving this in the mail I immediately went hone and watched then all!!! One if the best trilogies in my bluray collection! Totally satisfied and would highly recommend the purchase.
B0014DQSGW|5.0|Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock in top form!  Great &#34;opposites attract&#34; comedy.  Bad boy plus uptight good girl = Chemistry!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics. Fun game that's not dependent on inviting friends, or buying things with real money. You can't beat the fact that it's free either.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hussein's descriptions of the characters made me feel like I knew each and everyone personally. I had a clear picture of each scene. Makes one think how we all can be connected without realizing it! I wasn't too thrilled with the ending....
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Maybe the movie was made for 10 years old, but it moved me and pinned me to it the whole time.
193700788X|5.0|This was a rollicking good story, as we've all come to expect from Charlaine Harris in this series.There were so many ways this story could go, and none of the possible endings would satisfy all of Sookie's fans. Harris wrote the ending as she had always imagined it would be. All of the loose ends were tied up (at least the big ones). We'll have to wait for the next book to see if this ending is a happily-ever-after scenario, but I suspect readers will be pleased. My only complaint is that I wanted the Sookie Stackhouse series to last forever, as I am a huge fan. Good luck to Ms Harris in her future endeavors--I've been a fan since Aurora Teagarden, and I'm sure whatever comes next will be superb!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesomest game ever so much better than subway surfers its so awesome and fun! I love the cute little minions!
B0090KZDSK|2.0|Trilogy means 3, yet not in this series. It was like the author didn't know how to end it so just kept adding things that could go wrong then abruptly ends the book. Now I suppose we will have to wait 12 months for the next one, will be over it by then. Very disappointed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I give Season 3 a strong five rating due to the writing, acting, and the lovely scenery. I just wish none of the actors would leave the series. Hate it when they are killed off or die. Looking forward to Season 4 and the impact on Matthew's accident. Wish he'd be back but seems unlikely from that last scene!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This Netflix drama topped anything that was on networks this past season. The series has amazing characters, and I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for the next episodes. If you like the West Wing or the Newsroom, this story will definitely catch your attention.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This app lets you challenge other people no matter were you are but if your playing this watch out cause there's pillage that can steal your money
B0058W74UY|1.0|I have had it for a while. It does not seem to open any thing. I have other apps that seem to do what I need.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is very cool and is entertaining. I would definitely recommend it to creative people. And it is free I'm earning money by doing this too.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Nice effects, beautiful color and graphics. a wonderful untold story behind disney's classic. Not just for kids. Not for young children.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A little strange, pretty far fetched in  places but it kept my interest.  It was different but entertaining and well worth my time.
B00846REIS|5.0|I can't get enough of Gideon and Eva!!<br /><br />I am a Fifty Shades fan but this book seems better written and the story is very different.  Two wealthy people, no BDSM, and some more diverse characters. Some people call it Fifty Shades rewritten but I wouldn't go there at all!!<br /><br />Second and third books are out and make sure you have them downloaded because you'll want to jump right into them!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I love this movie. it is a tear jerker and good family entertainment. My family and I have watched it more than once.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I could not put this book down. Yes, it's targeted to a younger audience, but the simple language and gripping story line means that you can't put this book down. Great sequels that follow too.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I enjoy this movie and my students enjoyed it on the fun day off from work reward day. It is enjoyable and funny and I have watched it more than once.

B00DE76PM8|1.0|You really don't want me to comment on that app, it is rather close to being useless. Should say it has very limited uses!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|On my cultural event and reward day the children in my beginner Spanish class enjoyed watching this movie. They were glued to the action and engaged throughout.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun. even my mom plays this game and she never plays anything. so yea it's amazing. so five star rating.... lol
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The movie was engaging and had a lot of action. The movie was great because the hero was female and challenged many stereotypes that affect females.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|This game is fun but it doesn't really make sense. It's also too addictive. You should get it, but limit how much you play it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A very well written story that keeps you on your toes. Loved every second of it. Can't wait to read what happens next!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It had such a great developing love story that captured my attention. The creating of the characters was steady and progressive which made the book even more interesting. I couldn't put it down. The book was so heartwarming and emotional that set a different feeling inside of me. Again, I loved this book. I recommend to any Sparks fans!!
B00BLGY8X2|4.0|Weirdest thing I've seen for a long time but I totally loved it. I'd provide an overview of the plot but I really don't know what happened - the great thing is that I don't care. Its a fun ride!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is definitely for the romantic at heart! I loved everything about it! I could feel the feelings Megan and Conner felt because it was told with so much detail!
B00499QUK2|5.0|They cleverly take the book story lines and modernize it- keeping the same essential story elements. The banter is witty and the actors are great.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|When you first download it you only take care of rabbits, hampsters , and guinea pigs. But if you are addicted like me and wanted more animals there is one thing I need to tell you DO NOT BUY THE HORSES. Nobody ever wants to buy a foal as a pet, you may get dogs and cats and reptiles but DO NOT GET THE FOALS OR HORSES OR WHATEVER.<br /><br />  END OF REVIEW  :-)
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the wizard of oz and thought it was a fun angle on the story! It'll be interesting to see if any of the other Oz books are made into a movie. They should be. Seems like a better idea than a remake of Footloose.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I play this game all the time and I hope you will like it 2. Everything in this game is the best and sooner or later I hope the make a HILL CLIMB RACING 2. See you later<br />  END OF REVIEW
0743297334|1.0|Profound, stirring, insightful, mysteriously moving...nah.  I have this terrible habit of finishing every book I read, even the ones I hate.  This is the most tedious thing I've ever read.  Couldn't wait for it to be over.  Near the end my eyes skimmed past entire paragraphs because I knew it would just lead to more of Jake and Company ordering drinks, talking in half sentences about nothing, taking a bath before dinner, or sitting in a cafe or restaurant with more talk about...nothing.  Hemingway is a great author.  But this heap of nonsense?  Nope.  And yes, for all the literary snobs out there, I 'get' what the novel was trying to say, so dial down the indignant hissy fits.  It's just that Papa could have said it more succinctly.  Unfortunately, his final statement with the shotgun did say it succinctly.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|great movie the grand kids thought it was the funniest movie that they had ever seen love it too great
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I did not think this was going to be my kind of movie and I ended up really enjoying it. This is a great movie about slavery and all they occured. It has also very funny parts to make the movie not so down
034580709X|5.0|I love Harry Hole, even though it's kind of heartbreaking to read about him. He's a brilliant detective, but like most brilliant detectives, a tortured soul He's an alcoholic, melancholy, cynical on the outside but with a hidden streak of tenderness, carrying around all sorts of guilt, while daily facing the worst things that humans do to each other. Due to the quirks of the book trade, we Americans were first introduced to this gripping series of police procedurals midway through, when one of the later novels was translated into English. Later books were translated before earlier ones, and this, the very first Harry Hole mystery, is last of all. So it's satisfying to finally discover how the series started, the origins of Harry's career as detective, and to hear the full story of his search for an Australian serial killer that has been alluded to so many times in later books, even as it's sad to realize there may not be any or many more new books left to come.<br /><br />This is probably not the best book in the series (the plot is more outlandish, and it is a debut novel) but it's still damn good. Harry is sent to Australia to inquire into the murder of a Norwegian citizen, a young blonde woman who was a minor tv star. Harry begins to poke around, meets an interesting cast of characters, learns a bit about Australian political history, and things start to happen. Working with a team of Australian detectives, Harry concludes a serial killer is at work. Is it the hippy-wannabe drug dealer? the cross-dressing circus performer? a complete stranger?<br /><br />Lots of suspense, heartbreak, death, general mayhem, and twisty plotting make this an excellent read. If you're interested in the series, I'd start with this one and go in order, and I may reread the series in proper order someday too. Author Jo Nesbo (sorry I don't know how to make the proper Norwegian letters) has hinted that the Harry Hole series will not go on indefinitely, and there's lots of debate about whether his most recent Harry Hole book is the last, giving an extra bittersweet flavor to this read for diehard fans.
B008220BLG|5.0|I wen tand saw this with my grand-daughter and son and this was a great family movie,I had to buy it to watch again.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I kept hearing how great this series is, and friends with similar taste told me it would be right up my alley.  I read the first one, and some of the second one, and just couldn't go on.  Although the writing is good, and the concept and story are original and intriguing, I found it painfully slow.  I suppose I just need more action and a faster paced read at this time.  So I will come back to it at a future time and try it again.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|I had went and saw this at the theater with my son and had to buy it . This is a great movie
B009NY43NY|5.0|I enjoyed this final installment to an amazing series. Answered all my questions! No spoilers given here, read it and you will know everything!!

B00COHIFQS|2.0|This has to be one of the most rediculous movies I have ever seen.  The ending had me rolling my eyes.  Umbelievable and I stopped caring about how things would turn out for the characters half way through.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Life changing! I feel like a new person. Everyone should try this. It makes you feel like a new person.
B0063GORYU|1.0|I turned on the app the first time and there was a huge ad taking up the whole screen and it was kind of annoying to get back to the game screen. If it were a small ad on the side I would not have minded.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|Hey. ... where do I start. ..this album is SOOOOO good!!! When I read the reviews I had to order it. I am a HUGE fan of Joe and an even bigger fan of good music. When I put this album in,  I was expecting a nice album but he REALLY out did himself on this!!!! You can put it in and press play and you will enjoy it from start to finish!!

When I heard this hook..I WAS HOOKED! ! LOL<br />Get the picture? LOL. It has 12 tracks and I REALLY like all of them, but these are my repeats so far.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|YOU must read this book. Interesting, humorous and incredibly useful. I have read it front to back many times and constantly refer to it as a reference material for life situations and opportunities. Great Read!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this game!  It's just like the original, except how you have to account for gravity near objects, no gravity in space, multiple gravity fields, and even water on the 'planets'.  Great twist on the original!
0375869026|5.0|This book was a wonderfully written book. It is easy to read, and gives any reader a lesson in how to appreciate all people no matter what physical difference they might have. I loved the book and would suggest that adults as well as older children read this to get a better understanding of what people with physical differences have to deal with, and once you get to know someone their physical appearance doesn't matter any more.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Solid game and has excellent new mode that will keep you hooked for deck customization. The campaign was better than the previous ones in longevity and the encounters make it fun to play .
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This story is one more reason why Nicholas Sparks is my favorite. Thank you Mr. Sparks, for adding another treasure to our world.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a great app. I would recommend it to people how are looking for a simple game. It is fun it requires some focused.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|The Big Lebowski is a Cohen brothers classic. It's funny, sad, makes you angry, and by the end, you just have to love the Dude. It's Jeff Bridges and John Goodman at their finest. A must see!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|this was a good book to read with facts and not to much rubbish to sort through it is worth a read
0425256162|5.0|'Blue Remembered Earth' shows the reader a realistic and imaginative story about:<br /><br />Space Exploration, Underwater Cities. Interstellar Travel with Slower than Light Ships, Space Elevators, Brain Augmentations that prevent Violence. A Crimefree World. Smart Clothing and Furniture, Telepresence via Robots, a Solarwide Sophisticated Internet Network, Machine Evolution, Robotic Asteroid Mines, Self Repairing Coral Reefs, a Solar-wide-telescope, a Mandala Artifact on a Distant Planet, Darwinian Robot Battlegrounds on Mars, and even a Genetically Engineered Human Whale.<br /><br />All this in a Near Utopia setting where Africa dominates the economy, where climate change has pushed us into space and the world is finally at peace. Utopia's can be rather dull sometimes, but sometimes a book doesn't need to be full of violence and excitement, but instead offer us 576 pages of fresh and exciting ideas of human potential. It is a lively roller coaster ride through the solar system that will lead the readers mind to the stars.
B0074V3712|5.0|Impressive, short analysis of how we became human and what that means for the future. Multi-disciplinary but not overly academic -- very thought-provoking. Could have given opposing views a bit more respect and attention, but that's a mere quibble.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|works great on all my devices regardless of o.s. Never seen so many feature updates- for free no less! Thank you EStrongs development team! Keep up the wonderful innovations!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|West Side Story is the best musical ever made.  I've watched this moive a thousand times and will watch it a thousand more.  Everything about this movie is excellent -- the acting, the singing, the story line/plot and especially the dancing!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I can see now why OSC considered Enders Game more of an extended prologue. Enders Game was needed to set up this story. Parts of this book were very emotionally engaging.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's to much fun I can't believe it's much fun  y'all data out there u got to play it now please thank you
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A fabulous book. Well written and totally inspiring!! Truly endorses my belief and faith .would love to have a conversation with Dr. Alexander.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|eben alexander is a respected neurosurgeon worldwide, his coma for 7 days is one of a kind in medical history.  He is most believable about his experience and recovery.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|If your and Eagles fan you have to get this History Edition. Makes a great gift or Christmas present. Don't miss this one.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Very homey yet excellent performance.  And the lyrics to her songs and the feelings she loads into them, and expresses are great.....I loved the live response from the audience also.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Alfred Hitchck never fails to deliver excellence.  I loved the beautiful scenery, Gary Grants acting, and of course the fantastic bends and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat.  I also appreciated the fact that this was a movie that I could watch with my whole family.  Even though it is a old movie, the color quality was very good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its a fun game that keeps you guessing at first. but once you start recognizing the clues....it becomes addicting. glad I downloaded it.
B0042RJWTC|3.0|the dvds skip while playing them.  My son has not watched them all yet he has been very busy sorry took so long for feedback
B00AYB1TP0|1.0|It is boring. Nothing exciting for the kids. Not what they really want to do just moving part of the letter up to it. Not exciting at all.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Saw season one of the TV version on HBOand had to read the books.  Glad I did.  The tv show covers only a small portion of the books.  This first one sets the stage for the ones that follow.  If you are into this genre then this is a must read.  As with the show, the books are not high fantasy, this isn't Lord of the Rings or The Wheel of Time.  It is gritty, brutal with the violence portrayed and yet the violence isn't gratuitous, it is important to the story and the setting in which the books play out.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This illuminates what kind of person Steve was and how he accomplished what he did. It pulls no punches in telling the stories of how harsh he was. But what I find most interesting is Steve's thought process. The lens he used to change the world is unique and inaccessible to the bean-counters running most companies these days. Great fluid read. Highly recommended.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|Back to the REAL Joe...the balladeer!  You have been missed and your new album is much appreciated.  I still can't understand how such great talent is so underappreciated.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Game play is simple to understand, but gets very challenging as you progress.  I love the look of the characters.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Reading this book was like experiencing a dream that you never want to end.  Like a circus it was scary and fun at the same time.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This really makes you think. Entertaining and addictive.  Our whole family enjoys playing this game together as a team. Like
B00486070K|1.0|I bought this to use with my macbook air.  It works fine unless you are connecting to a switch.  I connect it straight to my router and it works fine but through a switch it's hit or miss.  Really frustrating.  I hate having to use wireless all the time.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|This show is both clever and funny to watch.  It is very entertaining, the only downside is that the episodes are long.
B004DM1ZQY|2.0|I had. to erase this app off my kindle. I couldn't take playing backwards anymore . I don't know why they did that but ill see how the. new one works out.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I like the game but I get no background music as stated in the description. anyone else have this issue or resolution? Really bummed!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Very addicting. Be prepared to play for hours! Pretty challenging as well. The puzzles seem to get more involved as you advance. I recommend it!
B005544TRQ|5.0|My wife and I both agree this is one of the better series on tv. The chemistry of the cast works well and at times it will keep you guessing what turn the series will take.  We have watched both seasons but missed the first episode but were able to watch it on Amazon prime.  The character &#34;Mike&#34; keeps the series moving along with snap neck quips but &#34;Harvey&#34; is able to fire back.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Masterpiece: Downton Abbey 3-DVD set (Seasons 1,2,3.)  We have enjoyed these DVDs so much that I ordered two more sets as gifts. Everyone loves them; they are addictive. It doesn't take long before you find yourself 'hooked' and looking forward to the next chapter... The sets and clothes, etc., are exactly as they would have been in that time. They follow history as the story unfolds and grab your attention most definitely. It's amazing that this on-going story would capture such a large following without resorting to foul language, pornography, sexual promiscuity, depravity, blatant immorality, etc.  Just a good story and a good, likable cast. We can hardly wait for Season 4 to begin in the fall. I would highly recommend these shows to anyone.
B00821OX98|4.0|This was a series I never had a chance to watch while it aired but after reviewing on Amazon Prime I can't stop wanting to watch the next episode.  It definitely has a Steven Spielberg feel to it.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Great CD, had all my favorite Garth Brook songs. Encourage other Garth Brook fans to add it to their collection.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Just got the game and haven't put it down. It's very challenging so you might get frustrated but it's Greattttttttttt!
B000QCSA54|5.0|Knowing when to lean in and knowing when to gracefully exit  are critical to one success. Seth Godin succinctly puts such complex thinking in a book
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game was like a piece of scrappy crap in sane. I never experienced this game to be taken along with my other game.<br />Other than this game, the only other game I have better than this one is Gangster Rio city of saints.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A great read. This story kept my interest all the way through.  It seemed to be a true-to-life account of how one family's nightmare changed their lives forever. Makes one think about how quickly, life as we know it can totally turn upside down in a flash. Surprises throughout and especially at the end.
B008RF0M9O|1.0|If you hope to fit this on a Sony MDR-V6 as this site suggests, try elsewhere my experience was not even close to a fit- to much of a hassle to send back look for Sony repacement
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Computer Graphics were ok but nothing special, lots of trite dialogue, and no chemistry between the young lovers. Perhaps that's as fairy tales should be: clear delineations between good and evil, not too intellectually challenging, the good guys win and the boy gets the girl, fun for the kids. But really, I can't believe anyone still puts the phrase \\"wait for it\\" into movies. That said, as a big fan of CG and special effects it was entertaining enough.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Got the message, tried to do it through silk or Amazon, but all u need to do is slide down bar at top of screen and press sync. Playing glacier land now, spare time has a purpose again !
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|The music is good.<br /><br />I had a problem with the case which was broken.<br />They answered me in less than a day and propose me different solutions to fix it.<br /><br />I chose a partial refund.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We enjoy this series because it shows how the wealthy families lived in the early 20th century.  The actors do a wonderful job.
B00DU74U74|5.0|It has been a couple of years since I read the book but the movie really brought the book back to life for me. I love the story plot!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie went by fast, there was a lot of action, humor and yes a love story thrown in there too..  I enjoyed it from beginning to end
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Love the game but I can't play because I can't update! Will be 5 stars when fixed. I hope they fix it soon!
B00364K6YW|5.0|The new Pride and Prejudice they made may be shorter and easier to sit through in one sitting, but this is by far the better version and definitely worth watching.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Just a great movie would recommend it for just about any one.<br />It has a lot for you to reflect on.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|The writing is riveting and the plot intriguing: especially fun for those living in Washington. I found it hard to put down.
0470876417|5.0|This book is something that provides the activities and visualization of what it takes to build a business model.  It is great for &#34;big picture&#34; thinkers who need to visualize the process of building a business model.  There are also several activities detailed on how to build every component of your business model with robust team inputs.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|nothing like an amazing drama that captivates you from one season to the next. I plan on having a Downton party for season 4
B00BW2LX74|4.0|I also feel John Hiatt is one of my favorite Musicians and he is prolific in his songwriting, but I will not find fault with this guy.  I've seen him live in Utah out in the open arena of Red Butte Gardens and if you are a fan, you become a deciple.  I listen easy to the new albums he puts out.  Then I do sometimes listen critically with a good set of headphones, not ear buds.  This way I kinda get lost in the music.  I don't normally listen with these headphones, just when I am really listening.  I don't know too many who wow me when I first listen to a new CD.  When I listened to Walk On, it was a rare experience the first time.  I just sat there listening and was so taken by this albumn, I knew I'd never hear him do it for me again like that.  I still listen to this album regularly.  Now, Mystic Pinball is good music, just not that good, but I am not going to rip him.  His genius is that he writes these songs so often that nail the topic so completely, that a 4 star song or even a three star song is real music.  Not some stereo type repetitive drivel or Top Ten playlist crap.  Music is an experience for me to savor and this guy cooks a great gumbo!  I do like this albumn and hopefully it will rate way up there with time.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Original version of app was a daily go to for quick reference to local &amp; world wide weather info.  New updated version is NOT USER FRIENDLY!  Deleting updated version without hesitation.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|It is impossible for me to describe this music, part cinema score, part hip hop, part torch song, all sex, all sensual.  It is nothing I ever expected to like and sounds like nothing I've ever liked before.  I love this album.
1439102813|4.0|it was a good story. it had points re: the disease that i thought were useful in dealing with family members who were thought to have the disease but i am now rethinking. our book club liked the book and it brought up wonderful discussions re: different types.
0525958002|4.0|Just started this stand am already impressed by John's candor,recall and vivid description of life in England in the late 70s. Was amazed to fond out the first Virgin record store was more a hippie co-op than huge capitalist conglomerate it is now. I am only a few chapters in and can't wait to get to the outrageous 90s. Still, John makes even the normally boring formative years interesting.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are amazing and the game is easy to follow. It gives realistic time on how long it v takes to take care of a real horse. It will keep you busy and entertained for hours on end!!! I would record v this for younger children looking for a real horse game.
B001992NW4|5.0|After reading William Friedkin'sautobiography, The Friedkin Connection, I had to go back and watch this again.  Read the book and then get this DVD that is busting at the seams with extra features. Both are well worth it.
B005SAYRA6|4.0|Provided an action packed movie that kept you extremely excited and eager to see more as the movie progressed on.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|Dr. McDougall spent decades researching the diets of healthy civilizations around the world and through the ages and found that people with whole food plant based starched centered diets with fruits and vegetables and little to no animal foods thrived and had non of the diseases and conditions of the western world. If you seek vibrant health without the complications and suspect nutritional advice from other sources, you would be wise in checking out this wonderful book. Highly recommended and very informative!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this programme. The characters are well developed and the storyline always keeps me interested. If you enjoy period drama, this is the show for you.
0880796863|4.0|Very nice cards. Not for a person who is new to this activity. Would be better used by a professional reader.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is great I'm addicted to it. its also funny doing it with the minions. and its free ya
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Basically what the title says. The way it's written, you really understand what it was like inside the camp, but I also think the author does a good job in portraying Shin's point of view as well. He explains how Shin thought and acted, and learned about feelings of guilt, family, and love. I am shocked to know that these camps exist. I even tried to look them up on Google Maps!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I recently downloaded this on my Kindle.  It really is a terrific site for just about anything you may be interested in pinning, following etc.  I could spend a lot of time on Pinterest.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not sure who is into this series of books but I gave up on the first one about a 3rd of the way into it.  A waste of time in my opinion.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|This was a good SciFi drama, at least I thought so. I have not read the book, so cannot compare the two, but the movie was good, and I might try to read the book now.<br /><br />In regards to the BluRay disc. Depending on the type of player you have, and the speed of your internet, might want to disconnect your internet from the BluRay player before you try to watch the disc a second time (My GF watched it before I did). I have high speed internet access, high enough that I can stream HD movies from Amazon without buffering, but the disc took almost 5 minutes to load, as it accessed the internet to download more bloody trailers, and being a Universal Disc, it would not let me bypass the previews by pressing Top Menu or Title Menu.
B0095G5AFU|4.0|I can typically be reading as many as five to ten books at anytime.  I may want to take notes on the books I am reading and I want to take the notes while I am on the run.  This little app on my Kindle is a great help.  Since the books I am reading are typically on my Kindle, having a Kindle app for note-taking is a great help.  I can open a \\"book\\" for each subject I am studying or reading.  I am further capable of subdividing subtopics within each \\"book.\\"  Within each book there is an automatic \\"indexing\\" feature. which helps the notetaker to find previous notations on subtopics.  The app itself requires a password for entry.  Once in the app all \\"books\\" are available without further security.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game for families. We also recently purchased the expansion Explorers and Pirates and are very pleased with that one as well. Looking forward to many family game nights with this one.
B004S2VZXC|5.0|When I came to the last sentence of the book, I was so stunned that I was in shock for a few seconds.  I can't get it off my mind.  It is one of those ending that the reader must end for him/herself but it was BRILLIANT!This story, written in first person is the conversation of a Pakistani man who studied and worked in America and had \\"made it\\" according to Western standards with an American man (a government agent of some type) at a cafe in Pakistan.  The style of  writing itself was so very interesting- a conversation in which only one man is talking but \\"repeats\\" what the other man is saying so the reader gets both sides of the conversation. The story (about the speaker's life in New York, is engaging and thought provoking.  A definite MUST READ!
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|It was an okay purchase, nothing to write home about. We ended up getting another mic because this one didn't seem to work well with our iPhone 5. Our test audio run went well and made audio significantly better, but when we tried to film to iPhone 5 with lepel audio, it was a flop. We didn't waste our time any further and purchased another product. It would work for simple YouTube video recording or something like that, but nothing for big screens or important shoots. OK for $20, but if you're looking for something legit, this isn't it.
1781162646|5.0|I was at first hesitant to purchase this book as I'm not a huge fan of scary reads which is what Stephen King is most noted for.  I am very glad I changed my mind however.  This was the PERFECT light, easy summer read I needed this particular week.  I loved the characters and although it did(SPOILER ALERT!) make me tear up in the end, it was all in all a true pleasure to read.  It has love(not only romantic), lust, friendship, suspense, hope, a touch of sadness, eeriness, and fun all in one short novel. Quite an accomplishment!
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Love this rainforest jumper. Keeps my baby entertained and occupied. He loves all of the little gadgets he can look at and play with. So happy we purchased it!!!
B00B81B0HC|4.0|great first full length album, should have a great future if all goes well.  Good range of music from ballad to radio hit
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I enjoy the game but I am stuck at level 10 because I don't know where to look or what to do for the clues. I had to accidentally figure out what to do on the other 9 levels.
B000TGJ8AS|3.0|Received before expected date and started watching last night.  So far so good, with no disc problems.  Very impressed with how fast I recieved this product.  Unfortunately unable to watch the 5th disc.....won't load.  No problems with 6th one and all others ok!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I had been waiting patiently for this 3 rd book to come out and was excited to read what I thought was the final chapter of this Crossfire series, only to find that the saga continues. I have not found out yet when this &#34;last&#34; book will be released. But I am aggravated that I have to wait yet again as  Entwined release was postponed for months. I will never read another series again unless I know it is complete. I don't like waiting months to find out what happens to the point of not remembering a lot  of what I read because its been to long and I have to go back to refresh my memory.Just my opinion. With that said I did enjoy reading the first 3 books.
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|I ordered this the same time as the Slots game, again after reading the reviews.  This is always getting stuck and again going back to the beginning.  Not Happy Again!!!!
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I love the Die Hard series, yes I know, mindless entertainment, but I can't help it.  Anyway, the reason I'm writing is that the Blu-ray disc wouldn't play on my VIZIO VBR200W Blu-ray player (DVD version played fine).  Screen came up and said I needed to upgrade software to play it.  Same issue with my ASUS Blu-ray connected to my PC.  VIZIO doesn't have a software upgrade so that's going into the kid's rec room - excuse to buy a new one, won't be VIZIO.  ASUS had a software upgrade and I got that to work.<br />So, be aware, new Blu-ray format/protection may cause your Blu-ray device to not be able to play this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses but have never seen such a realistic game in my whole life!!!<br />This is a great game and I recommend it to everybody
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I thought the movie had no real surprises. I liked the location of the movie but I didn't find the relationship very convincing. I also thought the husband's performance was bad.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I was devastated at the end of If I Stay.  I'm so glad that I downloaded the sample of Where She Went and purchased it. This is exactly what we wanted and answers all of the questions we were left with. If you read If I Stay, you NEED Where She Went.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Enjoyed movie throughout. Thought singing was great. Liked the pace of movie. Liked the costumes and scenery. Like conflict between hugh jackman and russell crowe
1589946006|4.0|So, I didn't buy these for their intended purpose.  I'm making a staff and needed a little Cthulhu to go on top of it.  So, on that note I can say that they work excellently, the base of the larger pawn is 1 5/8 inches and, if you shave the square off the bottom, it will fit on a 1 1/4 inch dowel.  Now, doing that accurately takes some time and a good saw, but it's easily possible.  Anyway, the little figures are detailed, the colors are cool, and they have some heft to them.  Larger ones have holes in the bottom to reduce the amount of plastic, so they could work as pencil toppers.  The smaller ones are identical to the larger ones, except they have an 11/16 inch base, don't have holes in the bottom, and you get a LOT of them.  Um, well, I like them, they make cool little figures to have scattered across a desk or sitting on top of a staff.  Only real complaint is that the plastic doesn't cut well with a jigsaw.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I loved this movie because it had so many great actors. The plot was interesting to watch and the movie awas alot of fun. I especially liked their dance at the end.
B002YVAT72|1.0|I am an avid music and vinyl collector, upon reviving this piece of crap I touched it and could feel the cheap parts, this player has no needle counterweight or pitch adjustment which is essential for  any record player. Do yourself a favor don't buy this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and interesting game but it is short lived. The game only has a few levels and than it is over. I wish we could get more levels. But otherwise a great game.
0062082353|5.0|Bought it as a Christmas gift for my son who is a military snipe - figured he would enjoy the story of his fellow marksman.
6305949980|5.0|I was trying to find a copy of this, lend my out and never got it back. love this movie.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This series has to be among the best I've watched. The twists and turns in the plot are astonishing.<br />I have to recommend this series to everybody. If you enjoy adult-themed drama this is your show.
0345803485|5.0|I'm a mature woman and most of my years very clode minded because religion and preconcive ideas. True the years I have known better. If a man loves you deeply and you too. Everything else is heaven. Yes indeef you can be turn on and orgadm for simple things in life. If you haven't love or bring loved like that is impossible to understand. We need to admit thst we humans came from all size and colors. Some women like to be dominated. Nothing wrong with it since the oppodite is true as well. Thanks God we sre all diffetent that makes this reading very intetesting. on't forget is non fiction.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is a very fun and challenging game. very enjoyable but not a perfect game and it is very addicting
B006CHML4I|3.0|It's a pretty watch, but the problem for me is that I dont use this watch like my usual watch, so, I have to set it with the correct time before I can use it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I got this book because it was recommended but it started out slow and I had a hard time getting interested in the characters and plot.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I am a pretentious student of the classics, and I loved this movie. Do not be deterred by its popularity.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love it!!  I do wish you would get a version of Candy Crush too.  This games plays well on the tablet.
B004TF3HZ2|5.0|I've been a big fan of Genesis as well as Steve Hackett for a long time and this 2 CD set without a doubt,is very impressive. Along w/Steve Hackett,there is excellent musicianship and vocals on these CDS and it almost sounds like studio recordings because of such a great performance and also because the audience applauds and whistles,only at the end of each song and not during the songs,which is good thing.<br /><br />Frank Albert
0920668372|5.0|This is a wonderful book to read to your baby well I think so I love this book I also,love the price they have it for, came well package no damage came way earlier then the expected day.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Very fun and relaxing.  I get started and never want to stop.  Have to keep building on to the tree of life.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|james wan is an amazing director hes directed dead silence saw insidous the conjuring and more. . . and mabie dead silence 2 : the return of mary shaw
B00785P2QC|3.0|It's an ok game, bit tedious but I will persevere, I won't be spending any money on it, have played City Ville on Facebook, and this game seems easier
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|It was not the best game but it is still addicting. it force closes I would still get it, it's a great game
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Like upgrades and weaponry, also good challenges. Like the graphics and oline battles and support.  The expansion is good too.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|my niece and I were beginning to despair of ever finding our favorite love story. We were so not disappointed. We fell in love all over again but what ever happened to happily ever after... Oh Vlad... Long sigh
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app I got the app the same day I saw the movie. I love the app and both movies.  I love it. If you like the movies you will like the game.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Amazing!  Love the show.  Love Jon Snow too.  What a cutie. Just need the 3rd season????  And also on instant play please.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|As far as westerns go it was a good one but jamies acting had a lot to be desired I thought I was sometimes watching sat night like comedy acts. why do they try to take a good movie like django and change it djago was never a colored guy or a slave I am a django fan but this movie was like dusk to dawn in a southern setting. sorry but not a good movie special effects way over board...
0385535147|5.0|It is an extremely fast read. It was everything I expected from John Grisham.  I am a die hard Grisham fan
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Can't wait for next book!! Awesome book upset I have to wait  for next series to come out. Love it
159463176X|5.0|This book is beautifully written, another classic by Khaled hosseini.  The characters are amazingly well developed, each with an intensely relatable flaw that pulls the reader in.  The book was painful at times, feeling like I did not want to read one about one more tortured life - but of course, it was impossible to put down.  My only complaint was that I felt a little unresolved at the end, I wish the book gave me more closure.
B003AJKPL2|2.0|Wasn't thrilled with this at all.  If pits came out, cherries were stuck in the pitter.  Cherries came out mashed.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|This app encourages 'slow doodling' watching the designs flow (yes, you can be as hyper as you want if that's your thing). It can be a very refreshing break in the day.  While I can think of options I'd like - mirror image - maybe it is actually best to keep it simple.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I loved the actor who played Captain America.  He definitely drew my attention and held it through out to the end of the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Just disliked couldn't get into it at all would not recommend I dont usually find feel this way about books
B007QDNKQA|4.0|liked the movie. A lot of action. You mess with a bull you get its horn as they say. Never mess with a Recon Marine !
B003VR5PPY|4.0|I originally saw a preview for this game's sequel - Zero's Escape: Virtue's Last Reward. It intrigued me, so I looked into it and found out this was the original/first game. Of course I had to buy and play this one first!<br /><br />Personally, I love puzzle and tactics-related games, so this immediately falls into my favorites. Love the multiple endings, but it's a pain that you have to play through ALL the other endings before you can actually see the real one. I wish there was an easier way to skip through everything you've seen before (at least, there isn't a faster way other than &#34;fast-forwarding&#34; that I know of), hence, my rating.<br /><br />Most of the challenges through the game aren't necessarily insane until you hit a certain point...and that's when the Internet and game walkthroughs come to the rescue (haha). The storyline(s) are rather interesting as well, and more or less make sense at the end once you get there. The controls are quite easy to grasp and are somewhat reminiscent of the Phoenix Wright series'. I did not come across any odd glitches or control difficulties that I can recall.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great game to occupy your time with multiple character stories and easy controls along with some challenging puzzles that will definitely tempt you to &#34;cheat.&#34; It would have been excellent if skipping scenes were readily available, but considering everything else, I don't regret purchasing it.<br /><br />Now it's time to move on to Zero's Escape: Virtue's Last Reward! Hopefully that will not disappoint and keep some decent connections to 999.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Good introduction to the effects of a wheat diet and transition to healthier eating. Excellent recipes, though I want the calorie and nutrition content.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is fun challenging and addicting. I can play it for hours. It is like temple run and subway surfers at the same time. I totally recommend this app.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Was a fun book...good, light, enjoyable read for summer vacation.  Self-deprecating, good story teller.  I enjoyed learning about her career progression.
B00AVFO41K|4.0|I decided to give this game a chance because it has reasonable permissions and the negatve reviews seemed a little excessive. I am glad I did.<br /><br />This game is easy and relaxing. The play is easy enough to figure out without instructions. The special function balls make it more interesting and help keep the board cleared enough to keep playing.<br /><br />I am not sure what all the complaints are about. It is what it is - a simple game that takes a little concentration to keep ahead of the added balls. If they didn't add balls there wouldn't be any play. It works well on the kindle hd. The point of the game is to beat your own score.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|When we were 7-years-old everything seemed bigger and brighter.  Years and maturity have blurred the wondrous world of adolescence for most.  Now, as adults, thanks to Neil Gaiman we can begin to remove the tarnish that has dulled our sense of awe.  Time can never take 7-year-old 'you' very far...no matter your age. Finally,  vindication  for those who swore to scornful faces that the monster in the couch ripped the cushion!<br /><br />NK Clancy
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Pretty good game other than the last level which sucked because it is like impossible to get through. But it kind of kontradicts the movie story line. Other than that get this game.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Interesting plot, and some good action also. It keeps you guessing! Now let's see what Red 2 is all about.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Nice beginning to the game. Not as easy as I thought it would be. Wonder where it will lead? Give it a try. I must get the next part to  find out!
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|This is not the sequel to Dark Twisted Fantasy, first of all.  Yeezus is a combination of really good and really bad songs.  Highlights are Black Skinhead, New Slaves (both industrial rap), Bound 2 (very trippy!) and the beautiful and chilling Blood on the Leaves (with samples of Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit).  I'd like to give it four stars, but it just doesn't work as a single album.  I had higher hopes for this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun exciting game for all ages.running thru the trains being chased by a Cop and dog.jumping running flying great game
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this weather app. There is lots of detail. Multiple maps on one page and down to earth weather descriptions.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Magical realism in the English countryside...it's a great read. Not the usual protagonist. Not the usual plot. Not the usual ending. But strangely engaging. It's like a nice amusement park ride that doesn't get you too wet or bent out of shape. And makes you consider another turn.<br /><br />Try this book. It doesn't disappoint.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is one of the best scripted shows currently in production, with outstanding writing, directing, casting, acting, and production quality.  Here's to many more years of excellence!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I loved watching this film.  You really could see Hanel and Gretal going and hunting witches as they grew up.  Lot of action and fun, dry humour.  The actors were well choosen.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|As a fan of the entire Harry Potter series (books & movies), this purchase was a no-brainer.  I elected to get the basic blu-ray without any bells and whistles.  All I wanted was the movie, and that's what I got.  Thank you, Amazon!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The best game...very challenging...one of the best games I ever played...you need to use your brain to win...very good!<br />Play this game...very intelligent...entertainment for at least two hours...amazing...
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|As a fan of the entire Harry Potter series (books & movies), this purchase was a no-brainer.  I elected to get the basic blu-ray without any bells and whistles.  All I wanted was the movie, and that's what I got.  Thank you, Amazon!
0345440927|5.0|This book is still helping me in the process of educating my toddler. Very useful, conforting and at the same time strict. Every mother should have this book.

B0084TWN9K|4.0|I 've always enjoyed Alice Munro's writing.  This one is different.  It's a bit dark and depressing, though still well written.  Don't take it along for vacation reading or lend it to a friend who's getting over a failed relationship.  Buyer beware.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|didn't even ask for the updated version. And I really couldn't rave enough on the old version. It was awesome and very easy to use and navigate. The new version is just ad space. and I don't like it. I get on the app. to check the weather. I use to use it everyday. now would rather watch the news.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|Not for young children under  years old.  Anyone else will find it entertaining.  Can't help but love Danny DeVito, no matter what he does.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I played Solitaire years ago in my early teens (many years ago!).  Last month, when I needed something to do all night on an overseas flight, I started playing it again.  This program was great because it helped me re-learn the game.  I asked for &#34;winning deals&#34;, and then if I was losing, I'd &#34;replay&#34; and use the hints to see where I had gone wrong. It was exciting to learn.  I'm getting pretty good at it.  I alternate this with my puzzles and word games as I try to out distance dementia.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|But if the blade is  cheap sometimes the wedge angle is too great to fit into the sharpener so it wont actually sharpen the edge it will just shave the sides off. This isnt a flaw, more just the nature of the product. If you want to sharpen a cheap hunting or camping knifenfor the first time this  ay notmwork, but if youmwant to sharpen a quality blade then this is the perfect product. I gave five stars because I cant find any flaws with the product when using it how it is supposed to be used.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|little bit of a light read- both in content and number of pages.  Nothing new here but interesting take on success and managing it thereto
B006LSZECO|2.0|Well written but too predictable.  A very unsatisfying ending.  I kept waiting for something more to happen.  Might  have made a better movie.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|fell in love with the actors and the music. Sometimes I put it on in the background just to hear the music!
B001MTENOC|5.0|I have always thought I was alone in thoughts and feeling about what happens to us after life.  This book hit some key points that validated my feeling and thoughts.  I had to walk away at times because it was too much at once for me to comprehend.  My mind can't comprehend but I know in my heart is right...I don't know what my purpose in life is.....but I want to find out.  I need to find out.....for the last 5 years I have felt so lost in my direction of life.  I am skeptic at heart......I hoping with more research and meditation I will find what I am looking for.
B004SIP7PS|5.0|I cried. This movie struck my emotional chord deeply.  I would definitely recommend this film to my friends and family~
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun. Easy to get the hang of. Challenging enough to hold attention. Does take a while to install and need facebook friends to play along, which annoys.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Not sure what criteria it uses to figure things out, but it will even be correct with obscure characters that one would think it would not get. Nice app, and fairly entertaining.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I can't recall a Denzel movie that I didn't like. This movie was no exception. I would watch it again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You should get it because it is amazing.  I'm happy that it is free! It is very fun to play.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I have always adored The Wizard of Oz and I love this fantastic prequel to the earlier Judy Garland film.  The CGI video is great, makes me think of &#34;heaven&#34;!  Enjoy!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Once I start reading I have a hard time putting this series down so far.  I'm. Not a reader but there's books keep me interested.
B0042FZWC0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Chris' book and can really appreciate his reasoning on strong individualism, minimalism and independence. What I like about Chris, is that he has built his lifestyle based on self sufficiency so that he can can pursue his dreams and have the freedom to help others. I really appreciate his view on minimalism - getting rid of unnecessary clutter and being free from consumerism and dependence on material things. Definitely an eye opener! It really shows that you can be successful without needing to become rich or materially wealthy. Life is not about wealth, but it's about having the financial freedom to make meaningful accomplishments - for Chris, it's being able to travel the world and to get involved in charitable giving plus helping others work towards a non-conformist lifestyle.<br /><br />We don't need to depend on external sources (i.e. an employer) or gain the approval of others based on following the social norms on how to live or gain an education. I strongly agree that a University degree is not the be all and end all. Ofcourse, it has its place but it should be viewed as an a necessary tool for a specific profession i.e. to become a doctor, lawyer or accountant. To be a doctor or do anything medical requires a degree and I personally would want to be seen by a doctor who has such credentials! But what Chris is trying to say, is that not everyone needs to box themselves into thinking they need a degree in order to be successful. Nor do they need to follow the expected path of 'job security' by being dependent on  employer/s, moving up the corporate ladder and then retiring aged 60+. We all know that such a 'secure' path is not even realistic based on economic instability and the unsure job market.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing your viewpoint, experience and life story, Chris. It's great to see people like you getting your voice out there. It gives us other non-conformists hope that we can get out of the rut we are currently stuck in.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Have seen this so many times I could cite the script. Unfortunately, there were so many interruptions for spooling that I gave up this time. Netflix doesn't do this. I have been very satisfied with Amazon for years, but their streaming needs work.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Phantom remains one of my all time faves! The costumes, the setting, the singing: all perfect! I am glad it is available on Amazon Prime Video! I will watch it several times because it is worth the watch every time.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Very enjoyable read, the man himself is fascinating.  Agree or disagree with the morality of the mission of the sniper, there is no doubt that it takes a very special person indeed to be the best of the best in that field.
B00CPH1UD2|5.0|Need I say more.  If you don't already own The Big Lebowski (or even if you do), this is a movie that NEEDS to be owned in a steelbook.  Whether you bowl, drive around, or have the occasional acid flashbacks, this is how The Dude was meant to be seen.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|While Naomi Watts certainly deserved her award, the movie seemed more like a documentary, mostly moving in its portrayal of the small kindnesses of the victims given to one another...ultimately defining what constitutes humanity in those moments where we know how frail we really are.<br /><br />I liked that it gives those Americans who are glued to reality shows and the Cardashians a picture of actual events of note occurring in the world.<br /><br />But despite being moved by the horror and pitifulness, I did not really connect with the characters...maybe it just induced a shut down. Hard to tell, but I expected more. Do not watch this if you are not in a pretty good place emotionally.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Seriously I was so enveloped with every page....sucked in to say the least....I'm so in love with the character peeta!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|It was kind of slow and not very entertaining. I think Tom Cruise did ok but the story and the other actors fell flat.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Cannot wait to watch Season 4 in January to find out what happens next.  It will be interesting to see how the writers proceed with the characters.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun game.  it is very challenging at times and easy at others.  would like to see move levels
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I wish I was living in this hotel.  A delightful film with wonderful acting.  More of this sort of thing is needed for those of us not obsessed with zombies and the like.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|prompt service, great packing, wonderful series.  i think i am addicted--can't wait for next season--shouldn't have killed off crawley--not fair.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|This is a delightful and surprising film.  Well worth the time to view even if you do not like MM - and who does not like MM????
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|The music that plays as you work on the games reminds me of biofeedback.  Relaxing and staying that way while playing
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|What can I say?  Thank G-d for Alan Arkin (and to some extent John Goodman) - great performance again - so very witty.
B006PE6VW6|5.0|If you are looking for a little light hearted humor then this is the movie for you.  My wife and I were dying laughing the entire movie.
B007REV4T8|5.0|The BEST James Bond since THE original.  Looks and acts the part.  Sad that we are to have a new M, but the new M should also be good - he can act!!!
B0090KZDSK|3.0|I enjoyed the first two \\"Crossfire\\" books but book 3 was a little disappointing.  Now I see there'll be another 2 books, not happy about that.  Don't know if I'll buy them.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|A delightful film with great acting.  Well directed.  More of the same PLEASE as soon as possible before we are all to old to enjoy it.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I wanted a CPU that would support PCIE 3.0 for a good value and this took the cake. Has worked perfectly for me since I got it. I have it water cooled and overclocked to an EASY 4.2 GHz totally stable using my motherboard's integrated OC tuning.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I like Meryl Streep and I liked Margaret Thatcher - so why did I dislike this film.  See it and you will understand!!!
030758836X|5.0|Wow, 12,000 Amazon reviews.  I am pretty critical about books, but found this one to be a classic thriller along the lines of Hitchcock, with more twists and turns than a Colorado mountain highway.  The characters are well-developed, and while I found the ending astounding - not what I expected - it was consistent with both Amy's and Nick's character traits.  There are no characters in this book you will like.  What Nick did was wrong, but Amy's retribution was way out of proportion.  At the end, it comes to her always wanting to \\"win\\" as she defines it.  Often in life there is no justice or fairness, as is the case here.  This was a page-turner supreme.  Well-written and this book will still be read 50 years from now.  My only criticism is too much gratuitous sex and sex references - definitely \\"R\\" rated.  Believe the movie based on the book will also be an \\"R\\".
B0016LTNL4|5.0|Great dry British comedy.  Much better than the American remake. Peter Dinklage is amazing as usual.  Watch this movie now!
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Agood read, kept me reading at the end to figure out the ending. Ending was a surprise. May have had too many sub plots
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I really enjoy this series. Unfortunately, either because the prior two books moved along faster or had more intrigue, this one didn't quite live up to expectation. It just started getting repetitive.  Still like the characters just ready for them to wrap it up.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  this is onne of my new favorites
B00881PTRC|4.0|The best hangman I've played, love the animation and the skill level is awesome, have to brush up on the academics to play this one
B00AB55BS0|5.0|bought this and it came as advertised, have had at least 4 people want to borrow the dvd copy, since they have no blu ray, and the digital is a nice bonus, looked and sounded great
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|There was such hype over this film.  I found it slow and boring.  As a matter of fact, I didn't finish watching it.  Perhaps it got better, but who has time to waste?
B008J5T4Q4|3.0|Most of the artist release an album of hits and that's the end, but I'm happy P!nk knew how to give us a good album and not to die after \\"Greatest Hits...so far\\". It's not better than \\"M!ssundaztood\\", but it's good. She should release other albums in vinyl, at least \\"M!ssundaztood\\" and the one of hits.
B000050HTO|5.0|I'm a baby boomers it's my kind of music.  Good selection.  Having prime and getting quick delivery is so good. Will buy more when I feel the need.
B007BWUK3W|5.0|Since I listened to this album for the very first time I fell in love with it: the lyrics, the music, different styles, it's sexual and sensual, aggressive, sad, nostalgic, happy, dark and...just Madonna. The cover and the inside, and the whole package, are wonderful. This album, and its songs, wasn't as succesful as other albums because a woman did it, 'coz that woman's always been advanced in time, and 'coz she's the best artist (man or female, solo or group, dead or alive, american or not) of all time and some people hate that idea; hurts but it's the truth. By the way, it contains one of the best songs I've heard in my life, or maybe the best: \\"Erotica\\". On the other hand, there's the best song about equality, I mean \\"Why's it so hard?\\", and many other great tracks (\\"Rain\\", \\"Thief of Hearts\\", \\"Waiting\\", \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Words\\", \\"In this Life\\", \\"Secret Garden\\", \\"Fever\\", \\"Bye Bye Baby\\", \\"Bad Girl\\" and \\"Where Life Begins\\"). Madonna should work again with producers like Shep Pettibone, Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I'm very upset! I've put a lot of time into this game, and when I opened the app today, I got a message saying that my version was old and needed an update. Clicked to update, and there was nothing either in the app store or on Amazon to update, so I simply can't access my game. There is also no way (that I could find) to email for tech support about this. I also tried deleting the app and reloading, and got the same message! What gives?!!!
1451695195|5.0|Would recommend this book for all who question if there's something beyond this life.  Eben Alexander presents a much different look at what heaven is and how science and christianity can be brought together.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|if you love minions you will love this fast paced game! relive the movie while playing this fun game! pthttt!

B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a simple game, we are having lots of fun playing it an its free so it's for me !!!
B0063S3DMK|5.0|I was looking for something to share with my 12 year old granddaughter.  This was perfect!  Beautiful cinematography, well directed, oozing with charm and inherent life lessons, it actually tore her away from the iPod that is attached to her at all times and gave us something to discuss that had touched us both.  Can't recommend this highly enough.  The acting is superb and the story tells a moral tale that isn't too cloyingly sweet to be tolerated.  All in all, a great film for older children and adults.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Cut The Rope Time Travel Is A Great Game For All Ages! I Really Enjoy It. Can't Wait For New Ages And Fun New Levels!
B000U6BT40|5.0|I liked this as it does not take itself too seriously, but has a well thought out theme and nothing in it is too adult for children.
B008XNPO20|5.0|The album transcends the barriers of most psychedelic rock and adds a new dynamic to self-imposed exile from society. Laying back to this vinyl is simply prime.
B00433SVP6|5.0|this is the perfect book, i am totally anxious for the next book, is a incredible adventure of jason,leo and piper!! i though that leo is totally HOT!!! kkkk kidding!! rick riordan is just the head master of all the books!!!!!!!!

0061537969|5.0|What a great book!  If you are a dog lover and ever wondered what your K9 friend is thinking, this is a must read.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Hi, I'm Chuck Norris, and I approve this message (and game).<br />- Needs more updates,<br />- this game mirrors the alpha stage in minecraft way back when.<br />- this game is really buggy (signs might crash your kindle)<br />- this game has a survival mode with TNT.<br />- this game also needs a super flat world, the nether and TNT needs to be able to be triggered in creative.<br />- final verdict... get this then go buy the CPU version of Minecraft. It's totally worth the 26 dollars, this one is worth the 6 dollars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|a great time killer lt a lot of fun too hope every body else enjoys the game like I am;)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it's great me and my little sister play on it a lot. it does take a while to load though. and it has boss battles. and can be challanging at times.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Really liked the story approach coupled with verified and confirmed history.  Easy to follow after a break from reading.  Recommended!
B00B2166BS|2.0|The magnet is too weak on this; it falls off the Nexus with just the slightest movement.  I bought two of these and both have the same problem.  I hoped to be able to use this while using the Nexus but it just will not stay on.  It works ok if you don't touch the Nexus and have it sitting somewhere it will be stable during the entire charge cycle, but that's enough of a hassle I just don't even bother using the cables at all.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Just love love love theses easy reads!  Lets the mind wander. Vivid and intense soft and gentle. Love the desire and restraint.
B005LAII80|4.0|fantastic movie.  written well and intelligently, acting is just rock solid and karl urban gives dredd a depth and subtlety that lesser performers wouldn't have even tried for.  and the actress playing judge anderson... my god, the camera loves her.<br /><br />a true shame that it didn't do better in theaters.<br /><br />but the cinematographers dropped the ball in that the light coming into one of the cameras was polarized (or polarized differently) than the light going into the other camera.<br /><br />what this means is that virtually all shiny surfaces in the movie (and there are a LOT of shiny surfaces in this movie whether it is metal or even the sheen off leather) will &#34;buzz&#34;... that is, the specular hilight is brighter in one eye vs. how bright it is in the other and this will make the image seem to &#34;buzz&#34; from the mismatch.  it's, at best, distracting... at worse, it makes one of your eyes feel like it has a film over it.<br /><br />and stereo in general for the movie isn't very accomplished... i expected better from a movie that was shot in stereo.  oh well.<br /><br />but aside from the stereo, the cinematography is fantastic and really makes a small budget movie seem much larger and more expensive than it is.<br /><br />gladly, there is a non stereo version of the movie on the same disc and the digital download versions are 2d so you're good to go regardless.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|This song makes you get up and dance.  Love this song! Thank god I had heard it on the radio before I bought it.
B005HSL626|5.0|I bought this game to give me something to do during night time nursing of my almost 8 week old daughter. I have become addicted to it and love playing it to help keep me alert while she's got me up at night :) I also play it during the day when I get a little time in between my other daily tasks and when my little one's are napping. Definitely recommend this game!!
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie but I love anything with Barbara Streisand. Cute way to explain relationship between older kids and parents.
B007J7LFTW|5.0|Any fan of Jethro Tull would love this album, especially if you already have Thick as a Brick..you just need this to complete it!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Loved it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy this game overall. The display is great, the music is cute and catchy (but not annoying) and overall it is good. The only factor I didn't care for very much was at the beggining of each level, the multipliers in the game are right where your finger would tap or accidentally hit. I accidentally hit one not meaning to and made me lose a bunch of Gru points that I was saving up!!!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Slow start but got very good as it evolved! Grandkids watched it over and over and over and over and
B003XVYLDU|1.0|I never quit on a book, but I stopped reading this 15% into it.  It is incredible to me that this book has become a &#34;classic,&#34; but it is not because Vonnegut is a good writer.  Literature professors might love this book, because you could try to divine what in the hell Vonnegut was doing by his bizarre writing style.  I prefer, however, to read books which are well written and which do not have to be interpreted.  Take my advice -- leave this book to others, and do not waste your precious reading time on this book.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Whew! Is all I can say. Loved the tie in to prior versions. This version actually had a much more personal storyline!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|as the story continues it was a great book read it too fast I need more hope we don't wait to long for more

B004ADH1RI|5.0|It has become a classic of youth adventures and I find that I haven't out grown it. Love the scenic backdrop of the Oregon coast. The conflict of greedy developers vs. the common man used to be a popular theme of that part of the country. Well acted youthful cast and the direction & cinematography well done. Bravo!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I'm a voracious reader, however there are few books out there that have actually altered my frame of mind. This is one of them.<br /><br />If you're an ENTJ or a ENTP, you will LOVE this thought-provoking piece of work. Highly recommend it.
1878424319|5.0|This book is a put down but pick right back up. This book has helped me in both my personal and professional life. Don't take anything personal was the best agreement although all of the agreements were mind blowing. If you are having any issues in your life and need some cheap but resourceful therapy, this book is it. Worth every dollar you will pay for it. Give to a friend in need. I brought 5 altogether and people are still thanking me
B005D0TETA|5.0|It was more than I expected but it looks like 720P format to me which is HD but not Blu-ray 1080P, Otherwise I think it was great!
B004LWZWC4|5.0|I completely enjoyed this movie with my kids. They were more interested in the birds and Jack Black but overall delightful comedy. And timely delivery. TY

B002ZG98UA|5.0|Resident Evil: Afterlife is an action film based on the video game series ''Resident Evil'' by Capcom. It is the 4th film in the series, and it is my second favorite.<br /><br />In this film, Alice meets up with Claire and Chris, and a few other survivors. They are trapped in a building surrounded by zombies, and they want to reach a ship on the other end of the city. There is a message coming from the ship saying that any survivor can go there to be safe. The group fights off many zombies until they reach the ship. When they get there, they find out it is a trap set up by Wesker. He is now fused with the virus in some way, and he has superpowers. The group must fight him off and save the people trapped in the ship.<br /><br />This movie has lots of action and cool looking zombies. The 2nd film called ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' is still my favorite, but I like this film a lot too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is sooooooooo addicting! All ages are urged by me to get this! If you don't, then you are missing out on a lot of fun and entertainment!<br /><br />P.S.- the little minions are sooooo funny! You will love them ;)
B005DJREJS|4.0|Based in the other titles produced/shown on Mtv, one would rightly flee from the mere suggestion of watching a show with any similar affiliation! Therefore, it was accidental that I watched a few minutes of the first episode of Awkward.<br /><br />I've only watched three episodes from that first season, but to my surprise I've enjoyed them immensely! It is exponentially more risqué than Freaks and Geeks, but has the same clever dry humor that made the best episodes of that series repeatedly watchable.<br /><br />That said, the subject material here is way too adult to be the purview of a high school sophomore! I know that the show is from the same network that glorifies teen pregnancy, but must they encourage that degenerate behavior? It seems they think so.<br /><br />In the first three episodes, our protagonist loses her virginity to the school hunk, then proceeds through the emotional issues and relationship questions of an adult. It's funny and cute to watch someone so young try to navigate these grownup waters, but unrealistic and irresponsible to suggest it is possible.<br /><br />This awkward teen is going through what every 20-something does. Only she's portrayed as a high school sophomore. That means the writers get to juxtapose high school angst against the maturation that takes place in college graduates. Funny, to be sure, but sad, too.<br /><br />Am I a prude? I am the father of two girls, yet I remember my high school conquests. And I assure you that teens today are just as immature and stupid as we were. The protagonist enjoys the maturity of a 21 year old, while stuck in the childish world of high school.<br /><br />Navigating this mine field while offering up the insights of a more-mature woman offers hilarious observations. I just wish the writers had taken a more removed perspective. Something more like the way A Christmas Story uses an adult narrator to explain/expound upon the child's perspective. But I suppose they'd have lost their teenage audience if they let an adult's voice sneak in there.<br /><br />On the whole, the show seems quite clever, if too adult. The humor is probably too dry for teens while the subject matter is uncomfortable for adults. As for me, personally, I am employing generous amounts of denial and suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy the show. I just hope the material doesn't continually push boundaries. Kids need boundaries--teens even more so! Removing them makes for a great fantasy for teens, but a horror show for their folks. This show is definitely not for anyone younger than 14, but might have lost both teens and adults due to the issues above. I don't care. I will continue to watch as long as I can stand seeing this beautiful little girl act like a college student. If it gets too uncomfortable, I'll simply turn it off. The first three episodes were funny enough, though, to hook me in for at least a short ride!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Was skeptical at first but it was only .99 and I enjoy the show so thought I'd try it.  It's a kids game, very simple, but loads of fun.  A lot of levels and mini challenges keep it interesting.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie has take the title of *watched most times* at my house.  While it isn't everyone's favorite move it is near the top of everyone list so it has been watched a lot.  We purchased the digital copy and love just streaming it from Amazon's website so we don't even need to go look for a disk.
0142410373|5.0|If you're an adult, buy this book for your child, then see the movie with your child.  Both are great in their own way, and in the movie, Mara Wilson does a great job playing the part of Matilda, as does Embeth Davidtz playing Miss Honey, a teacher any child would love to have.  But this is suppose to be a review of the book, not the movie, but it doesn't matter.  Both are great, and they do have their differences, as any book and movie version of that book would.<br />If you're a child, read the book and see the movie, in that order.  I can't vouch for the musical that's now on Broadway.<br />I myself saw the movie on TV and liked it so much, I decided to read the book, and I don't regret it one bit.<br />I have read many times that this was the last book ever to be written by Ronald Dahl, author of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" (or in the first movie version, \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\\")  There, five children, all brats except one, are given a tour of the factory.  The roles are reversed in \\"Matilda.\\"<br />First, the book is set in England, as opposed to the Americanize version of the movie<br />Second, in \\"Matilda,\\" the adults, with one exception, are the scoundrels, and the heroine, being Matilda, with her classmates/friends, are much more sympathetic, and for good reason.  Matilda herself came into the world as a gifted, but unwanted child, with negligent, self centered parents, and a bratty brother to boot, where the father, Mr. Wormwood (note the surname) was a used car dealer, dealing in lemons, and cheating the customers out of their money big time.  The mom goes to bingo every day, leaving the child at home to fend for herself, and she does, with flying colors.  She teaches herself how to read by looking at every magazine and book in the house (how she does it is beyond me, but that's beside the point).  The girl also learns to do mathematics in her head.  With the family watching TV every minute at home, Matilda, of course, couldn't stand that and goes to the library to read almost every book there.  All this she does before the age of seven.<br />Of course, what's all this knowledge without learning to deal with your enemies?!  She also learns how to play tricks like putting peroxide in her father's hair tonic and glue his hat to his head, even putting a bird cage with a bird up the chimney and acting that a ghost is haunting the house, with the family scared and believing it.  All this they deserved, because she knew her dad's unscrupulous ways in selling cars that are clunkers.<br />When she finally gets to school, she meets the headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, a very strong and sadistic woman who hates and tortures children, and Miss Honey, a very loving teacher to sees Matilda's gifts and steers her in the direction she should go.  A closeness develops between the two, and Matilda later finds out of her teacher's past, with Miss Honey being Miss Truchbull's niece, and the horrible ordeals Miss Honey endured as a child.  There are scenes of Miss Trunchbull terrorizing the children, publicly humiliating them, bullying them, (one child is forced to eat an entire cake before the whole school; another is swung around by her pigtails) torturing them the throwing them around and locking them in the Chokey, a closet full of broken glass and nails. Because of all this, Matilda quickly becomes friends with all the classmates, in spite of her gifts (no jealousy here), mainly because they are all in the same boat as she is, being terrorized.<br />Matilda then finds she has the power of telekinesis, being able to move objects with her mind, and then things get really exciting.  She uses all her powers to help and protect her classmates, and Miss Honey, and then deal with their tormentor, and many exciting things happen in the meantime.<br />I don't want to spoil this for you, but the book is exciting, has a happy ending, and includes scenes that the movie omitted.  You'll love both.  Read the book!  See themovie!  Both are exciting, and both are an inspiration to children everywhere.movie!  Both are exciting, and both are an inspiration to children everywhere.
1452115567|5.0|A visual delight and a good giggle. The wonderful patience of Maddie and creativity of Theron!  Everyone will love Maddie.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|As always he's excellent. There are some newer sounds for him and yet some with the classic style he's famous for. I highly recommend it if you like Josh Groban.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|this game is awsome you should buy it but it wont update. for me or ells I would have gave it 5 stars
B005LAII80|5.0|Gritty, stylistic, awesome. Just how a comic book film should be. As a big fan of Dredd for years this was an amazing film brought to life brilliantly. Karl Urban really kicks ass and you really do believe he is your hero brought to life. So need there to be a follow up film.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Great actors! So many great moments and quotes in the film.the best out of the trilogy if you ask me
1466986743|5.0|As soon as I started reading this book, I just knew that I was going to like it. I came across it by sheer luck when someone had shared a Face Book post.<br />It focuses on a close to the heart story telling of paranormal experiences. I must say that I got goose bumps when I read through. I highly recommend this book to ALL. And if you're not into this type of work, then this would be an ideal first, you won't be disappointed.
B0012UNWJ8|5.0|My 7 year old, who happens to be very good at chess, absolutely loved this movie. So check it out!

B005544V6A|4.0|My favorite part of this show is the fast and smart dialog.  The random movie quotes and witty puns and repartee makes the watching experience a lot of fun.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I would suggest his book to anyone who likes good quality fantasy and history books if not both I have read the series over and over again and it is always a pleasure to read
B00CW665VI|5.0|That was so good :)<br /><br />I laughed till I almost peed my pants during the thanksgiving dinner. There were many lol moments in the book. I wasn't sure but I actually enjoyed it being written in Drew's pov it makes your feel as if you know him, as if your his friend and he is laying the story out there for you so you can understand that he has changed his one time only rule, that finally one woman has bewitched him mind, body and soul.<br /><br />He is nothing but persistent he sets a goal and goes all out. He may of seemed arrogant and a complete jerk but he layed it out there in black and white never denied anything but all it took was Kate to swoop in and show him what he has been missing.<br /><br />I knew he was sweet and loving by the way he was with his niece, so I had no worries that he would win Kate over and give her all her hearts desires.<br /><br />To the author. Wonderful job!!!!
B00280LYIM|5.0|I am not going to go into the details but I would definitely recommend this book and all other books written. By Rick Riordan they are all a joy to read!
1401233384|5.0|This was a great story made even better by having Batman as an integral part of the plot line. Recommended to anyone with even a passing interest in DC comics.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|It is hard to give enough superlatives for this book.  Building on an already incredible Name of the Wind, this book shows the growth of the main character as well as builds the foundation for tragedy to come.  Truly one of the best books I have ever read and I am on the edge of my seat for the third.
1401234550|4.0|Classic Sinestro, manipulating everyone around him to further his own personal goals. Must read for any Green Lantern fans (primarily because it is a green lantern comic!)
B001L5YW9I|1.0|I read the book a few months. It was entertaining. This movie wasn't. It was difficult to follow, difficult to hear because the audio was recorded so weakly and difficult to see because some many of the scene were too dark.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Directions included not very helpful.. YouTube videos were more helpful! Otherwise it is a really motivating thing! I recommend it for new runners to help with training!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book! My heart melted in it. My heart broke in it. My heart was then put back together in it. It was by far one of the best romance books I've ever read. Defientely couldn't put it down.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I thought the book was really good and told a great story! It gave u some thrill and romance! Great book! I've watched the movie but the book is better! Can't wait to see the movie again!
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|it was really fun and I still like it..but it has about a kajillion and one pop up ads and you have to buy mostly everything(I don't buy things from apps) it is highly annoying..but yet again its still fun..just annoying :(
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Love this show and Kevin Spacey. My husband and I recently started watching and have downloaded all of Season 1 to enjoy while we are on vacation.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game, take some brain to figure out how to go on to the next level. Still stuck on level 5 :-(
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This is a fun, fast-paced read in the spirit of Douglas Adams. Includes background material and commentary by both authors.<br /><br />Footnotes in Kindle edition are at the end, and thus awkward to read.<br /><br />\\"Mercury Falls\\" by Robert Kroese is similar in theme and tone: [[ASIN:B003HHQ12Y Mercury Falls Book Series ebook]]
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a perfect game for horse lovers. I absolutely adore horses!! This is the perfect game for me. It is very addictive and fun to play. I have it on my kindle Fire HD. This game by far my favorite horse game.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|This is very disappointing.  I have tried several times to get this to work. I have no idea how to get it to work.<br /><br />Next day update:  I had been clicking on Appstore to upgrade the game.  That was giving me major problems by sending me back to my game where it told me time after time that I needed to upgrade my game!  On a whim, I clicked on the Silk button.  Amazing!  It took me to my Kindle account, let me upgrade and was very clear on how to have it download.  It's now working perfectly and I have the new Ice Age level. :)  I've upgraded my rating from 1 star to 3 stars to reflect the original problems I had otherwise it'd be 5 stars.  The new level is interesting and I've already found DNA to research.<br /><br />Now that it's been working and it's been 4 months I'm updating my review. I'm having problems with the Glacial park.  The characters want you to buy an animal with at least a 15% bonus, a Watch Tower with at least a 5% bonus and a building with at least a 5% bonus.  NONE of these exist!  Otherwise I'm really enjoying the game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I both enjoyed all three seasons.  Waiting for season 4 is taking to long. But I am sure it will be worth the wait.
0312430000|5.0|Gawande is one of the best writers out there when it comes to healthcare issues. He provides some interesting, but important points of view about our current healthcare system. This book was a game changer for me.
B005544V6A|5.0|Dramatic and well written.  I'm hooked can't stop watching this series.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Highly recommend.  On season 2 now.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a great IDEA for a game, but it is very frustrating as there are no hints or directions or options. If you're stuck in a room, you might remain stuck for good. I played it for about 20 minutes and enjoyed it for 15. If there's an updated version, I'd like to try it again. Glad it was free or 99-cents... don't remember.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like it and found it new and refreshing.  I found each level more complex as it should be.  Good game for all ages
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I just love these adorable minions. A great movie for the entire family to watch w/ their children. This is definitely a buy! You w/ not regret the watching nor the purchase.

B00ADS98FC|5.0|My daughter wanted me to watch the movie with her so she could show me the &#34;Cup Song&#34; that everyone was doing last year. I reluctantly agreed. We both loved the movie.
0061950726|4.0|I very much enjoyed the first 90% of this book - right up until approximately page 250. It was so engaging that I stayed up late to read on two consecutive nights and then finished the third morning. Part of my disappointment might be that with the e-reader I did not realize that there was a Q&A with the author, book club discussion questions, and history of orphan trains at the end of the book, so I thought there was far more \\"book\\" left than there was in actuality.<br /><br />The first 90% was magnificent. Rarely do I read a book that alternates between two characters and two different time periods and feel complete engagement with both story lines. Molly and Vivian were such in depth characters, and I felt I really knew them. Many of the supporting characters were quite one-dimensional, particularly Molly's foster parents, Ralph and Dina. My issue is not with how the book came to an end, but rather the abruptness of it. Once the telling of Vivian's story in the past was finished, the book rushed to an ending. I would have appreciated a little more fleshing out. It really felt as though the author had a page limit, was getting close and decided to wrap things up. In spite of this, the first part was so good, that I would wholeheartedly recommend Orphan Train.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Well done!  The screenplay did a very good job of translating the book into a movie without losing the true nuance of the story.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love the show and the music, so the cd is great. The voices are beautiful and some songs really strike a cord, a few are just ok, but it depends on how you relate to the music.
B003TGMFG4|5.0|it evoked all kinds of inspiration and thrill within me. Finished reading it a couple weeks ago and now here i am quitting my job so i can go back to school to persue my dreams. And i feel amazing because of this. If i hadnt read this book im not sure i would be actively going after my dreams with such enthusiasm. I was going to stay at my job for another year and live comfortably yet unhappily while doing so. But not anymore! I highly recommend this book to anyone. Im also contimplating a cross country road trip thanks to this book. Christopher McCandless was someone i really wish i could meet.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun to play. Not too hard not too easy. I let kids play it without issues.  They have fun with it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is such a fun game... I love all the thinking you go through. Need brains for sure to do this.. and pay very well attention to detail... some math but it's awesome
1609611543|5.0|Bought this for an older friend who was very interested in the book.  She loved it and thought it was a great buy.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|If anyone is interested in mental illness,or knows someone with mental illness,the brings better understanding of how difficult it. Is to live with this illness. I find this subject fascinating,
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love Ms. Collins' ability to tell a dark tale in such a way as to not overwhelm young readers. The plot and story is engaging for adults as well, definitely safe to stack this up against Harry Porter!
0060751967|3.0|I admit, I must be the last person in the world to read this series. After seeing everyone rave about them, and even hosting the author on my blog, I decided to dive into the Love At Stake series by author Kerrelyn Sparks.<br /><br />The first half of this book I thought was rather cliched. While I found it funny at times, other times I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the story. Not only was the dialogue cheesy, but so was the plot. Then after I got past the first half of the story, it really started to pick up and really grab my interest. I did like the authors writing style though and the side characters were ones I can't wait to read about -- especially those kilt wearing/sexy talking Highlanders!<br /><br />While I am not completely sold on the series yet, this is definitely one that I am going to continue reading. I am interested to know how the Vampire \\"Civil War\\" is going to play out now that there has been a dramatic change in hierarchy. With the fall of one and the partnership of another, you can't help but wonder what side is going to win. I also like the side story of the Stake-Out Division of the CIA and the impact they will have for future stories.<br /><br />For an old time paranormal romance mood, this one fits the bill on the quirky side. Not one to take seriously, but one that will definitely leave you smiling.
1626810915|5.0|I decided to buy this book on the recommendation of my little brother. I bought the paperback instead of the kindle because I like writing in books and I love holding a book in my hand.  I've read a lot of business books and biographies but this book by far has to be one of the best books I have read.<br /><br />It's inspiration, motivational, and has business philosophies in a well-written honest manner.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book or anyone, no matter what age.<br /><br />Knowledge is Power.
1455502758|5.0|thanks for great service. the book is in great condition and i look forward to reading it as soon as possible.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I was looking for something to break the spiritless monotony of the tower defense genre. Good game sir and good day!
0375851569|5.0|Nicely packaged gift set of books. Great present for kids. Was going to buy this same set in a store but saw it on here for half the price! No complaints.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|sound quality with this is not as good as plugging iPod directly into Mercedes iPod kit, but it does work well for my android phone.
B000VUCIZE|5.0|Fascinating discussion on religion and what the consequences are to believers. An important book to understanding today's world events and the motivation behind behavior.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really like the way the author builds on the characters and world she started.<br />Good sequel that keeps the story going.
B003O86FMW|4.0|All in all a good book, but mushy at parts, and some aspects may not be appealing to many people.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|I'm a die hard fan since I'm a kid, but the last one wasn't to good, but this one is die hard again, first I though wasn't a good idea put a son who is like him cuz is difficult change bruce Willis but at the end u think they find the perfect guy for that, and the movie is so great
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|who doesn't enjoy the minions? awesome game. kind of a mix of other games already out there, but with minions instead.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was one that I could not put down.  The story was riveting.  I was sad when it ended.<br />.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Every bit as good as Ender's Game, but a different type of story.<br />Can't wait to read the next book.
1451695195|5.0|Well written and very enlightening.  Dr. Alexander was bold to write what he experienced<br />in this book.  We would like to believe this is truly the hereafter.....
B005MMY9A8|3.0|I know the whole thing is fantasy but you have to buy into it based on something. Consistencey of what each of the charaters can do would be a start. Then the love interest is suddenly , a thing, and we have to accept it like we did the magic hammer. As lovable as Natalie Portman is I failed to see why Thor was pining away for her. Nothing happened between them. She found him in the desert then bailed him out of jail, that was all it took evidently. This is not a spoiler because just like most of this movie it is nothing but a collection of tired tropes. What else was supposed to happen?<br />I think the only reason this movie was made was so the Thor character would be established before &#34;The Avengers&#34; came out.<br />As mindless entertainment it is fine, nothing more.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love this hidden object game. I like the fact that the rooms and objects are in different formats from time to time.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|I remember seeing this movie as a kid and loved it so much that I begged my mom to buy the VHS when video tapes became popular. Michelle Phifer is beautifully tragic in her portrayal of the winged half of a cursed couple while Mathew Broderick is adorable to make even a petty pick pocket endearing.
1607066017|4.0|Intersting Storyline, great character development.  All and all a great start.  I wouldn't say as good as Y, but maybe it will get there.  Overall I would definitely recommend it for a great sci-fi read and the art is fantastic!
B00AVFO41K|2.0|This is ok for a time wasting game if you get it for the FAOTD. But I wouldn't waste any money on this one. I was questioning whether to download it at all with the app description being broken English that didn't make a lot of sense in some spots. But decided to let the game speak for itself. As other reviewers have said, there are no instructions. Basically you are given a checkered board with a few colored pegs. You need to move the pegs around to line up 5 of the same colored pegs. There are different bonus type pegs to help. Some examples of those are: multi-colored (to use as a universal peg), arrowed pegs (to clear a column/row from the arrow on), bomb pegs (to clear all adjacent squares), some that are combos of bonus pegs (multi-colored with another bonus). With each move you make more pegs are added to the board. So the goal is to make as many match-5 combos as you can before the board fills up. There are three difficulty levels. That's the game. Most of it is all up to luck since you can't make a lot of strategic choices with not knowing where the next set of random pegs are going to pop up.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Great game love the illustrations BUT it takes a long time for anything to be done in this game unless u spend money or have lots of friends that play also which i do not.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a great game for kids and teenagers.you can defet victor and collect bannanas and coins.its an awesome game:)))

B000VSAEYI|5.0|This pool is so fun. My kids love this pool. My 9 month old and 2 1/2 year old really enjoy splashing around in it. You def need an air pump to get this thing up and running. Perfect for toddler pool party.
B008Y1NY14|4.0|This is a great book for learning CSS3.  It really explains many of the aspects in terms that are easy to understand.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wish my kids read it when they were in school. Great story to make kids think about other peoples' feelings!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|It does what it is supposed to do, not much different than the battery indicator on the kindle. Very basic, but not a bad app.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! I am an art teacher, and now I go to Pinterest for most of my ideas! Inspiring!
B0081KTHEQ|2.0|It was nice to see Daniel Radcliffe, honestly a fine actor, land this dark role, and in a few instances the brooding interiors and misty landscapes did make for appealing eye candy, but it's an unfortunate commentary on The Woman in Black to point out that those were the best parts of the film. Toned down a few degrees this might have worked well enough in the classical sense as an English country house ghost story, but as heavy-handed as the movie wound up being, it suffocated under the weight of its own lurid efforts to frighten. I will not swing all the way into the camp of those who call this a bad film, because it isn't, it's merely a mediocre one that fell victim to its own ambition to be great. If you're curious about The Woman in Black, rent it, don't buy it, because I can't imagine you'll find much in it that compels repeat viewing.<br /><br />Let me put it this way...<br /><br />Creepiness: 3 out of 5.<br />Setting: 4 out of 5.<br />Plot: 1 out of 5.<br />Surprise twists: Zero.<br />Flinching moments: 2 out of 5.<br />Performances: 3 out of 5.<br />Overall effort and ambition: 4 out of 5.<br /><br />Better luck next time, Daniel. Hang in there!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This worked great, many sound choices, and I loved being able to have it start out quiet and get louder!
B006G2124E|5.0|This is a fantastic movie! It's hard to imagine that this happened not all that long ago. Wonderful cast! Amazing story!
030758836X|1.0|I was very disappointed in this novel.  I found it disjointed.  My low recommendation mainly has to do with the filthy language, which could have been cut drastically.  That would not have changed the story at all.  This book is just not my kind of reading material.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very cool is very addictivy is cool Downal this apps but this downal very slow and enter of the game. In android is bad copy thanks for this apps

B0092SQ5EG|2.0|This movie did not maintain my interest as I fast forwarded through most of it.  She had a nice story to tell but
B006LSZECO|5.0|Such a well-written novel that explores the depths the main characters' minds. It starts a little slowly, but picks up pretty quickly. The juxtaposition between the present story and Amy's diary entries gave the novel an interesting viewpoint into the 2 timelines colliding.  Believe the hype about this book!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This was an entertaining, fast paced movie.  Kept my interest throughout.  I would recommend this movie to others to watch.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Highly recommend the whole series. Am  impressed with this author - the feel & flow of the last three books much like the previous eleven. Well done!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I loved this before on my phone, but now on my Kindle and this latest update which gives me even more details I'm in love!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The best book I have read this summer.  Very different and very well written.  The story line and the ending were not what you would expect.  More books from William Landay
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|I Loved it! Too cute! I laughed through out the whole book then hugged and snuggled my puppy after wards.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My son and I LOVE this movie!!! He's only 18 months and this is one of his favorite movies. This is the only movie he will sit through the whole way.
B006LSZECO|2.0|After receiving a few recommendations for this book and having read much hype, I dove into the book. I stopped reading about a hundred pages in, the first time. Found it boring and predictable after the first few chapters. Picked it up again, later, to give it another try. This time, I read it all through. I do not spend my time with people who are endlessly narcissistic, manipulative, and whiny, and it was no fun spending time with these characters. I had hoped that I was wrong on my initial reading of the novel, but the second reading reinforced my opinion. For me, the characters and situations seemed contrived, and there was absolutely no transcendence. Many readers loved this book, but it did not work for me.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is the best hidden mystery games I've done so far. It could stand to be longer for the cost.
B006S009IY|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT!!  LOVE JOHNNY DEPP!!!!  HE'S THE ONE OF THE GREATEST ACTORS OF ALL TIME!!!!  SO GLAD I WATCHED IT!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the house, love the characters, love the situations, love the history.  This has been a great series! Can't wait to watch the next season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love  how I can literally feel everything Katniss is going through.  I could feel the dehydration in the  beginning and I felt her desperation to know that Petra was going to be ok. I love this book.
0596805888|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  Potter's approach to cooking science appealed to my inner Geek.  He breaks things down in a way that aligns with how Geeks think.  But even if you are not a Geek, the common sense tips are worth the time to read the book.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Work as advertized. Don't have any means to measure the transfer rates. However, it seems all USB3 hard drives running pretty fast via the hub.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. Best way to watch is on line one season at a time. This version contains scenes cut from PBS.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Matthew McConaughey isn't your &#34;typical&#34; lawyer. While the movie gives a different setup, Matthew's character turns out to have heart.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So interesting and entertaining! I am disappointed each time i get to the end of a season. This season has so many unexpected story lines! Can't wait for season 4.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Now that Vince has passed I think it is a little clearer why it was written this way.  Didn't like Mitch almost getting wiped out and his recovery was disjointed for me.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|We sat down an watch the movie over the weekend.  My wife has read the books and seen parts of the movie on TV, but this we are working our way through the series, and she is enjoying it.  My daughter has seen the movies several times, and likes it each time.  It is a really good movie that can be watched repeatedly.  It is a great movie, even if you know the whole story line.
B007HUD6OS|1.0|skip  this one it is not worth reading  I think he wrote it on a depressing winter night.  Don;t bother
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Needs more rooms but the ones it has are really good . Takes some thought and time to get through them.
0425263908|5.0|I loved this book, it is a lot like 50 Shades of Grey. I plan on ordering more Sylvia Day books.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Worked to reinforce counting with preschooler. This was fun family time. Solitaire is great alone as well. One touch moves made it a quick play.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|I'm a big fan and since I have all of her CD's and attended 2 of her stimulating concerts I had to listen to her tribute of one of America's finest jazz trumpeters and vocalists, Chet Baker.  This product certainly lives up to my expectations of excellent work by her and her band that includes husband and bassist Mark Johnson (Bill Evan's last).
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I am too old for all these tricks.  The organization and use of dialect or made up words was a problem for me, as was the organization.  Perhaps if I had the luxury of reading the book straight through I would have had less problem following the stories, but that was not the case for me.  Thank you for the instant video which brought some clarity to all the stories.  I watched it after reading 400 pages, and took a few notes from that source which helped me sort out the ending.
B00BI745AA|2.0|Lead actors can't sing very well. Bad choice for a musical. Beautiful CGI and setting though. Sacha Cohen and Helena Bonham-Carter were great Thenardiers.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far, the best Bible App out there.  Hands down, you can do so much more with it: reading plans, devotionals, sharing, highlighting, etc.  Awesome!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I found this movie surprisingly funny.  Although it was more entertaining than expected, I only gave 4 stars because of some crudeness.  I don't understand why this is in a majority of Hollywood movies these days!?
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I did not read this in my high school years.  I am kind of tired of the current fiction these days, I don't get where the gruesome topics come from and why do I want to read depressing subject matter all the time!  Decided to read classics and thoroughly enjoyed this novel and it was FREE!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show takes you back to a different era effortlessly. Great cast and the story and picturization are amazing.  This season ends with Matthew in a major auto accident.  I think his death and having a hier to downton opens new possibilities for the next release.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I did not read this in my high school years.

B00006AW2G|5.0|I have nothing to add to all the superlatives of other reviewers... apart from saying it's my favourite album.<br /><br />But I can tell you that the cake featured on the front and back cover of the LP was made and decorated by Delia Smith, a currently noted English cookery writer and presenter.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|Comparing this film to Pride & Prejudice (Kiera Knightly) -- well, it leaves a lot to be desired.  It's not &#34;unwatchable&#34; but very slow and blah!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|umm I mean its a good game and all.... I really like it and umm yea there notnmuch to say... everybody should play it
0800141660|5.0|This film is comes closer to Pride & Prejudice (Kiera Knightley) than Persuasion, Emma or Becoming Jane as far as being entertaining and great story.  Love the cast and the countryside is just lovely!  It's a keeper!
0440246318|5.0|Why Hollywood ever picked Tom Cruise to play Jack Reacher in the film is beyond me. Thank you Lee Child for a great character
0767020308|2.0|Very disappointed.  What a busy body!  I bought this movie after reading the reviews regarding Kate Beckinsale's role.  Perhaps I would have been happier purchasing the one with Gwyneth Paltrow.  Very disappointed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I think the title says it all but, Pintrest is amazing! I have like 30ish borads and I'm on like everyday and I get to see pictures I love! So get this app!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun way to pass the time. Great for grandkids to play while you need them to be quite. They love the trains and finding the coins and other things in the game.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Well, here we go again. Another great app that was &quot;improved&quot;.  I really liked the ease of the old app, now it's just another social media app. I don't care about &quot;sharing&quot; weather info, just wanna know if it's gonna rain tomorrow.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is my new obsession.  Can't put it down, so it's also my new diet plan, cause I can't eat and play too!  LOL
B0061US58C|4.0|Not quite as good as the first. Good but more attention paid to the plot on this one and my son wasn't as interested.
B0035LJZ1Q|4.0|This interpretation of the classic spooky tale of the &#34;Headless Horseman&#34; has everything a good spooky film should have. The spin from the Irving story was pretty original and the atmosphere was perfect. Strong cast who all earned their pay with the skill one would expect and a rather nice job by Christina Ricci which was a pleasant surprise, not having seen any of her other work.<br />This is honestly, in my opinion, a 4 1/2 star film but there was some excessive silliness in the script that tipped away from a higher rating. A bit gory but in a suitable manner and not disturbing and fitting for the story. I'm not being unfair in my rating as I did enjoy the movie, I was just a bit put off by some of script. Having written all of that, I'd put this up with, &#34;The Woman in Black&#34; as far as spooky is concerned but with a light hearted touch, a bit of humor. Humor is one thing but the silly lines and scenes could have been made a bit better. As a lover of this story for many years, this version is one I will own and watch often.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Series 1 of Downton was so flawless. Series 2 was a bit more soapy and contrived, but good still. Season 3 has quite a bit of soapy drama, contrived drama, and some ridiculous circumstances to accommodate actors leaving the show (which was originally supposed to end after the first series, so I can't blame them, but it's tough to see them handled in such a way after building relationships with them for 15 years in show-time. Still loved it (marathoned it in two days) but it's hard not to compare to the incredible start of the series.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is super terrific epic awesome amazing insanely good it's the best game ever.I will never stop playing I sat here waiting for it to donload
B00D2K40WY|4.0|this game is great for children who get board on long car rides or even just need some thing to do durring the day.

1612680003|5.0|Great book that provides common sense financial management and wealth building.  Well worth the money spent to acquire the book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Ok yes I'm mad how it ended.... BUT only cause it ended. Is anyone not completely STOKED that there is going to be yet another book?!?! I'll take any ending if she'll keep writing this story!!!!!! Can't wait for the next book!!!!!

B00821OX98|5.0|Ya know to be honest there isn't that much on Amazon Prime instant that Netflix and Hulu doesn't offer (I know I have them both haha) but the one show I found that they do (as of now) exclusively offer is Falling Skies. This is a great show, there are some slight dry episodes, but majority are really gripping and they leave you asking and wanting more. I've just started watching the second season and it only seems to be getting better.
0345541588|5.0|Ordered by my husband who has read most of Lee Child's books. He enjoyed this book and has passed it on so others can enjoy it too.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This a fun movie for kids of all ages and adults alike great animation like the Disney films or should I say DVDs buy the bluray is better
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A sweet story that appeals to one's rose-colored view of past ages while it tears at heart strings in the present. Sometimes a bit unbelievable, therefore the 4 stars.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|What can I say about the Star Trek seasons they all great 123 buy the bluray is better the picture the sound and the extras are worth the price

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I had to read this to find out what was going to happen between our heroine and the handsome Christian Grey!
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game for those who like to create and expand cities. similar to Sim city but better. highly recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|And, of course, I had to read this one to get to the ending of the story!  Good ending and I liked it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|How many of us take for granted that clouds really do have silver linings. I'd wager, plenty of us.<br /><br />Truth: I saw the movie first (and a second and third and fourth time) before I read the book.<br /><br />Some movies touch down with a lightning strike and this movie was all that.<br /><br />The author's writing style is smooth and does not impose itself on the reader, and soon you're down with the story and what happens next, turning pages at near-lightning speed.<br /><br />The story is bigger than Philly.  It's everyman and everywoman who's ever known anybody with a mental health issue.<br /><br />As you read, you see and hear the characters from the movie. You may see them walk into your diner. (I saw a dead ringer for Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany Maxwell walk into my fave 40s diner.)  It's an example of how true-to-life the author has drawn his characters.<br /><br />As you read, you see people you know. You injected the movie into your veins four times and you've read the book. The story bites.<br /><br />It's not for nothing that this year has been a watershed year for books about mental health issues.<br /><br />The book is like a carousel. The music starts and you're riding your steed. You're reading and you hear the the music as you ride your steed.<br /><br />As your horse rises and falls around the carousel toward the ring, you rise and fall with the hero. You want the hero to catch that ring and you hope to heck he does because you know people who have been on that same ride. Some came back in one piece. Others returned fractured.<br /><br />And after you've shot up the movie into your veins four times and read the book once or twice you remember that yes -- clouds do have silver linings.<br /><br />And for the first time in maybe -- years, you see the silver linings every day.<br /><br />This book lives in you.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|An awful lot of sex almost overrode the story line.  The story itself is a good one.  I can definitely envision &#34;lost's&#34; bad boy as the main character.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This games makes you think outside the box. I don't know if I should be sad or proud that I need my seven year old's help'but we enjoy playing it together
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Can put it down,good for a rainy day. Interesting out come.very big on emotions . This is how a real man would be
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Really good plot and although it might be over the kids heads, you do not have to worry about them being in the room, like most shows on television. You can still have drama, love, and romance, without the rated r scenes. Wish more shows followed suit.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|alright, I picked up my game today and found out I couldn't play it because it was apparently outdated. I found a way around it. If you've been playing this game through the facebook server and are now stuck without a way to update, remove the app from your device and the reinstall it via the appstore. All your data will still be there a d with better graphics and a new glacier park. Enjoy!
B009I2UH2W|1.0|I usually trust griffin products, but my second replacement broke for the same reason. It works well for about 3-4 weeks, then the charger begins to fray at the end where the connection to phone is, and stops working all together within 2 months. Don't buy this product. I've been through 3 replacements and all the same problem.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I've really enjoyed this series!  I've watched two seasons and it's just kept me coming back installement after installment.  Well done!!
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|This is another DVD I bought for the grand kids and they like it very much.  I watched it with them the other day and even I got a kick out of the movie.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Rely easy and fast just 1 click no problems so far and no bugs, recommended for youtuber's enthusiast good app
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My children ages 14 and 15, and I, often read the same books.  I found a few years back that this was a great way to connect with them.  My daughter and I are both reading this series and can't say enough about how good a read it is!  I encourage teenagers to share these books with their parents and parents to share them with their teenagers- I assure you great conversations will erupt at the dinner table!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game would be a great game if the menions were not so hard to control. I am playing on my Kindle fire and there is a lag when you swipe the screen to move around, so you may think you are moving out of the way of an object but because of the lag time you don't get moved and then you end up loosing your menions  to pointless stuff..
B000FBJHT4|5.0|Stunning details and certainly well worth the purchase. Whether you believe the whole thing or not, you owe it to yourself to at least be aware of what this highly regarded and principled Retired Army Colonel has to say. There is a very interesting background to the writing of this book that is not mentioned by the author and is not readily available, but much of the credibility of these things rests for me in the knowledge of this background.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Written better than the first, very confusing toward the end. It usually has a way of coming around though.  Bring on the last book.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|What a nice surprise.  If you like Bowie, you will like this album... his sound is still true to form.
B00AVFO41K|5.0|I do agree it needs instruction. Found it frustrating at first but gave it another try now I'm hooked. Not forsure if I will ever clear board but find it a challenge to beat my previous high score. The bombs arrows and multi colored balls use to your advantage. Get 5 in a row or diagonal of same color.
1467934925|1.0|As mentioned in the title of the review.  The way this edition of the book was formatted (I assume someone got a copy of a PDF and printed it somewhere to make money from something they did not create) is terrible which renders the book rather useless for my purposes.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Works very well. It is very clear and no static at all. I would definitely recommend this product .Sd card works great.
B005G8AFFG|5.0|Thanks to Pandora Radio, I happened to run across Ana on one of my personal &#34;Blues Channels&#34; and jumped right on it!<br />If you are a Blues fan, check this out!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I definitely enjoyed reading this book, but I liked the first two better.  It ended without a real cliffhanger and didn't really leave you with much to hang onto.  But I'm excited to know a 4th and 5th version is coming.
B007SPPANM|5.0|Oh my what a movie!<br />I absolutely love this movie and have watched it many times, never tiring of seeing it.<br />It is one of my all time favorite love stories.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Love these books always an interesting read. Can't wait for the next one. Wonder if it'll b the end of Percy
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|True passion combined with a great story involving characters you really care about ! Will definitely recommend to those who love books with amazing heat!!!
B00847KFDS|5.0|Enjoyed the songs and the people singing them!  Just proves that good lyrics and tunes can stand the test of time!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|If you enjoy Tina Fey's humor, you will love this book.  Great summer reading, I found myself laughing out loud.
B00667KMUO|5.0|This was a present for Father's Day.  My husband loved it.<br />Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Nothing like the movie (thank God), but a wonderful collection of stories. Witty, Sad, Heartfelt, and Thought provoking all in one. Loved it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was never an avid reader until I turned 40 and started reading books with my niece. I then picked up the 50 Shades series because everyone was reading it. After I plowed through those books in a weeks time it left me wanting to read more in the same genre... I turned to the Crossfire series after a friend recommended it, stating it is better than 50.. I fell in love with the series and read all the books in a short time span and it left me wanting more. As soon as this book was available on my kindle I downloaded it and two of us at work read it in two days. Loved it, can't wait for more. Please don't end the series and if you do please start another series in this genre. In my opinion this series is Sylvia Day's best series.
B005IMHBI4|5.0|I laugh from beginning to end. Absolutely LOVE this movie. Tom Cruise cracks me up because he nerves are shot and Dustin Hoffman is GREAT! I don't usually watch movies more than once, but I keep watching this one over & over.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|It is a shame that they only made 4 series Scott Bakula did a fantastic job. He has grown over the years from a good actor to an exceptional one. Every one of the series is entertaining  and diversified.
0345803507|2.0|I cannot imagine what all the fuss was about. I think the book was boring. The writing awful. Sorry, but not for me.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app it is so relaxing! I love how you can combine different sounds to make a super sleep inducing &quot;song&quot; that's custom made for you by you ! If you have trouble sleeping you should totally get this app. There is a lot of different relaxing sounds and its free!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the Weather Channel app on my Kindle Fire!  It went with me all over Europe.  I look at how cold/hot or stormy it is where my far flung family is.  I look at it before I go to sleep and see how chilly it is in Utah, and how hot it is in Luxor - fabulous.  Today it was gone!!!! Replaced by a pretender, all graphiky, trying to be exciting.  Folks, it's the weather.  I just want the weather.  I am an artist, I don't need weather art.  Let me buy the old one back!  Please!!!
B0043EV774|5.0|What else can one say about Johnny Depp.  I did not like his performances in Pirates, but he was first rate as Willie Wonka in Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but he showed his true acting abilityy and range in Aice in Wonderland.  He was flippant, deep, concerned, sorrowful in each of his scenes.  His voice as he quoted from &#34;Twas Brllig&#34; as he marched with Alice through the woods was profound.  Only Johnny Depp could have pulled that off.  Bravo!  As for Alice's intended, well, there is nothing more to be said.  He was her intended.  Her intention was not for him.  Her erstaz Father-n-Law was made of sterner stuff and recognized good business sense when he heard it.  I wonder how Alice is doing in China.  Hopefully, making much, much money for her late Father's company.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A solid continuation of the original, glad  I am late to the series and can jump right to the conclusion of the trilogy
B0064X7FVE|5.0|One tap = full weather details. It can't get any better than this, especially living in Chicago where the weather changes at the drop of a hat!
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|As always, Mavis is awesome. She expresses her faith, without being offensive about it. she is truly a gift from God.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|A real classic that never gets old.  If you are a Jack Nicholson fan and a lover of scary movies, I highly recommend this unforgettable flick!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun addicting game<br />Good graphics. Wish there was less st buff to buy with gems only but otherwise perfect. If u love horses get this game
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Now I realize that they have to make changes from a book when they create a movie but all that is similar from the book to this movie are some of the character names.  The ending is COMPLETELY different amongst other things.<br />Watch only if it's free.
B00594XOZU|5.0|omg i love this...me n all my friends have this to talk to eachother...this is supperrrr fast....i bug my best guy friend on here and scjnce its fast and he types fast but slow at the same time anyway it always gets to him before he can send it to me....!!
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Gives some historical substance.  The acting and costumes are great. However, I think it would be better without all the sexual content.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Every level gets harder but overall,I had a very food time trying to get out of the rooms. It's a great game and I think that anyone who has some patience and the time will have a good time playing this game.
B00005JK8K|4.0|It was enjoyed by my teenage grandson. The rest of the family watch it too. Everyone enjoyed the movie with popcorn.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It's kinda like call of duty.  Don't deny this game is money well spent.  It's like one of those games you never what to put done.
B002VECM6S|4.0|This movie was bought to view on the movies screen in the Van. You  and family will really enjoy this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a great game.  Some areas are like the movie.  It's mostly like temple run.  Hopefully you get this game.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed this game. I loved the attention to visual detail but I would have liked it if the screen could be enlarged more than what was allowed. Many of the items were difficult to spot on the Kindle Fire screen. I was disappointed when the story ended.  I expected to play longer for the money I paid to unlock it after the free intro.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I LOVED THE CONCLUSION TO EVA & GIDEON, I CANNOT WAIT TILL THE 4TH BOOK COMES OUT. GREAT READ & PAGE TURNER. LOVED IT!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was so excited when this was released, but a little disappointed when I read it.  The story line was drawn out and ended abruptly like the others.  I though this was going to be the last book but apparently not.  While I love Gideon & Eva, I think it is time to bring their story to a close
1401937268|5.0|Beautifully drawn artwork. Enjoy just looking @ each card. A little different than traditional tarot cards but same concept.  Affordable pricing & super fast shipping
B008YYCUES|5.0|I loved Weeds, I enjoy Dexter, I love Homeland and now I am hooked on Suits. I'm so glad I bought seasons 1 & 2 I will definitely buy 3. I had no idea who Gabriel Macht was before this series. I watch a lot of movies and enjoy some Showtime and HBO series. I can't believe I missed him. He along with Sarah Rafferty are a joy to watch. Those two have such a great rapport and Gabrial \\"Harvey\\" is a fantastic actor who apparently is underrated. This is such a great series! Hopefully a forth season will get the green light.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|We love Eureka's quirky far out there science twists.  In addition, we also really like the interactions between the main characters.  Eureka has funny parts as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was such a great book! I couldn't put it down! I read all three in three days! I haven't been this captivated by a story in a long time.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I liked this book and I think everyone should read it. It helped me understand the power of forgiveness and how to keep peace in my heart and my life.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Just started to watch to pass the time, needless to say I'm hooked now.  Very interesting story, have a lot of post apocalypse shows out there, I really like how they threw aliens on the mix.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is truly amazing and the minions are so cute... its really fun and I recomemd you get it ITS SO ADDICTING!!!
0439023513|5.0|I bought this book to continue The Hunger Games trilogy and it arrived in great condition, at the time it arrived a little later than expected since it has been so popular, regardless it was a good product.
1936608898|5.0|I read this book and did my first Whole30 in Feb/Mar 2013.  I lost 7 pounds, but noticed MUCH improved digestion, elimination, skin, hair, and mental clarity.  My sleep was off almost the entire time, but not in a wy that kept me from functioning.  Truly, the principles in this book are SO TRUE and EXACTLY what we should all be focusing on for better health.  Why is it such a crazy concept to our country to EAT REAL FOOD???  I recommend this book to almost everyone, and I'm about to embark on my next Whole30.  Who knew I'd be excited to cut out grains and dairy?!?!?  The energy and mental clarity are seriously worth it all.  SUCH a FANTASTIC book!!!  I'm on my 2nd read!
B005544TRQ|2.0|This is a great series and the picture was great.  However, the picture stutters every minute or so and that's a bit distracting.  Please fix this.  Thank you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is great fun and funny more places better powers and crazy costumes greatest ive played so far
B008BQ8YHQ|2.0|This is a great series and the picture was great.  However, the picture stutters every minute or so and that's a bit distracting.  Please fix this.  Thank you.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love it.  I am glad they worked all the bugs out.  And they keep adding more vehicles and terrians and upgrades..
B002W1UEW4|3.0|If you are looking for an Oscar movie, this is not the one. Now, if you are looking for entertainment and fun, this is your thing!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|WOw!  Wow! Wow!  I loved this book.  It kept me on the edge of my seat, I hated when it ended. PLEASE  don't make us wait to long for book 2.
B001MKQS4O|4.0|Great acting and 2 stories in one.  Some may find it slow but for me it was like a lazy river slow steady and enoyable..
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Been playing everyday and score has not changed in 4 weeks, even tho I'm completing all missions and daily challenges
B00AALX5SI|4.0|Very nice movie about Katy Perry. Give the filling of be there like be part of the work group of her.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I hate when  work interferes with my reading time, especially when I can't put the damn book down. The deep 3rd person POV is textbook beautiful.<br />Excellent.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I really enjoyed being able to see the history of the Eagles.  I've alway been a big fan.  I had no idea there was so much ill will going on in the band.  I'd heard rumors over the years of why they were breaking up, getting back together, etc.  I always thought it was Don Henley who was the A__ Hole of the group, but soon found out by watching these CD's it was Glenn Frye.  He seemed to me to be a spoiled, self centered, person who only had his best interest at heart and not the legacy of the Eagles.  Who knew!
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|I never owned this set on vinyl as I had an aversion to doctored (or patched up) live albums.  However, the few additional songs (not available on studio albums) and the overall atmosphere, not to forget that the double remastered CD is available at a fraction of the cost, then...<br />It is good to hear a happy McCartney in fine voice and the songs live show the passionate performer side of this iconic composer/performer.  The show has a dynamic that sadly slowly disappeared in what he would call the 'mist of time' as he grew older and relied more on gimmicks and theatrics.  A fine collection it is and it makes me even more eager to see the re-release of 'Venus and Mars' (some time next year?).  This remastered series sound great and belong in every McCartney fan's collection.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's enough different from Upstairs Downstairs to not be redundant, but I think if you liked Upstairs Downstairs, you'll like Downton Abbey.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|For all of us who have had the most messed up things happen in our lives and wish we could write them down so the world could laugh at the insanity of it all...David Sedaris does it and does it hysterically.  Thank you, David.  --Sherri, Cary, NC.
B000002VCQ|5.0|This  if  my  favorite of  Whitney  Houston!!  This  is  the  firsit tape  I bought of  hers!!  Myf avorite  song  is Greatest love  of  all!!
B009G3T01M|5.0|Surprisingly good CD. Liked a few of the singles that were played on the radio, but others that I had not heard just as good.
193700788X|1.0|I have to agree with most of the other reviews.  What horribly, disappointing ending.  The last few books have obviously been lacking and unfortunately the finale was the same, maybe even less because at least the last few books still made me want to read the next.  The way the characters from past books were just thrown in this one, really without any rhyme or reason, felt sloppy and thrown together.  And if C.H. wanted Sookie to end up with Sam there should have been more of a build up in previous books like the love story between her and Eric.  Eric was also the next main character, I believe, in the books after Sookie, so for him to disappear without so much as a fight, in just a few pages, made absolutely no sense at all!!<br />I started reading the series after watching the first season of True Blood and right away fell in love with the books.  Now I'm happy the tv series has taken such a HUGE turn away from the books because I don't want to be disappointed by that as well!!
B0059XTUB8|5.0|I had read a few biographies on Marilyn, so I was familiar with her sad beginnings. No one really understood how caring she was in every way. This film is a nice distraction because it focuses on her warm heart and gifts. In so many ways she was a legend and a star. A real star can laugh at themselves. She was golden. This film is just about one of her movies. The acting is excellent. Christine C
B00A757EFW|3.0|I downloaded this game because I spent endless hours playing Pac-Man when it first came out.  Since I didn't have a joy stick, it was much more of a challenge.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was an amazing book! It made it easy to read all day! Getting book 2 immediately! Sorry it took me so long to start this trilogy!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The series is great for a weekend &#34;watch marathon.&#34;  The reason I recommend a marathon is because once you start watching, you won't be able to quit!  Great purchase!
B007JMW46U|5.0|A must read was meant to read this book for years but never got around to it, but was well worth the wait. Great book
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have used Pinterest on my laptop, but this ap made it easy to browse on my Kindle.  I recommend to anyone who is curious and appreciates the creativity of others.
0736092269|5.0|Anyone wanting to learn about the body, muscles, and groups worked per exercise...this is the book. Easy to follow and really helps with finding that right exercise to target a certain area.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am so freaking addicted to pinterest it's not even funny. I've had pinterest for 7 months and I get on whenever I can. Recently though, pinterest has been updated and it crashes a lot. It's really hard to enjoy it when it freezes a lot. But other than that I lurve it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What else can I say about the Hunger Games that hasn't already been said.  The book and movie were both great!
B004ADH1RI|3.0|a 1980s coming of age flick with some good one liners to make you chuckle or groan. Good rainy day movie
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun! Great spin off game from the movie. Fun for all ages. I would definitely recommend it, plus it was a free download.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Read this book 3 years ago and absolutely loved it. You get lost in the characters. I was so hurt when the story ended, and can't wait to see what this film adaptation will be like. You'll love it!
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I have to say I really loved this movie. It was great, the cast was great the story was great. Loved the dynamic of this love triangle.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This App is very easy to use! I go to this App frequently for lots of uses. This App is also free.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This book is very cleverly written about an intense situation from the perspective of a five year old. I was intrigued by the story and moved by the main characters. I would definitely recommend it!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I saw this movie knowing full well that it doesn't live up to the book. In my opinion, a lot of vague things happen that reference what happens in the book. This includes characters. If you didn't read the book, this movie will leave you scratching your head. Gale only shows up like 5 times for less than 10 seconds each in the entire movie, and he ultimately seemed unimportant to the plot. Flashbacks are vague, for example;<br /><br />&#60;spoiler&#62;<br />In the book, Peeta sees Katniss in the rain and throws her some bread. Very straight forward, she appreciates it, no question. In the movie, a 10 second flashback shows Katniss, and Peeta staring at her. Then something that looks like a shoe or a lump of coal lands in the mud(it's supposed to be the bread)... If you didn't read the book, you probably wouldn't even register what is going on and just assume that a lump of coal landed in the mud, &#34;what does that have to do with anything?&#34;, you might ask yourself.<br />&#60;/spoiler&#62;<br /><br />Despite the movie being almost 3 hours long, events are rushed and scenes aren't even long enough to register what is happening. I didn't care about the characters at all, not NEARLY as much as I cared about them in the book. However, the movie attempts to get me to care anyway, and even expects it, only to produce cringey results. Cinna, Heimich, Gale, Primrose, even President Snow. Just a handful of characters from the book that evoke strong emotion, all fall flat in the movie. They simply aren't allowed much character development. Interestingly, even President Snow is given more screentime(and lines) than Gale. Effie Trinket, the lady that does the reaping, is given proper time in the book. You even begin to see things from her perspective and even start having empathy for her. In the movie, what little time and lines she has just develops her as a high-class prissy jerk, completely unrelatable.<br /><br />So, all-in-all, this movie just isn't that great. It's more of a companion to the book instead standing on its own. If you've read the book, this is an OK watch. If not, don't waste your time. Read the book first/instead.<br /><br />Personally, I could see this doing well as a TV series similar to Game of Thrones.ore of a companion to the book instead standing on its own.

0321525655|5.0|Everyone who has to present something (that's pretty much everyone these days) should read this! Opens your eyes in many aspects.<br />Warning: after reading this book, you may fall in the pit of cool-pictures-only presentation creation. At least I created presentations without any text after reading the book, and they were also not very successful. So be calm and find the right balance!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it! Its a brain teaser. Good for playing while waiting or just bored. Very entertaining! I hope they make more.
1932100660|5.0|This book was one of the cornerstones why I started to follow vegan diet. Pretty well scientifically substantiated and convincing.
B00280LYIM|4.0|Couldn't put the book down! It was a fun read and I loved the adventure. The author does a good job.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I started reading this book wondering if it would be just another WWII story of enemy-vs-enemy-become-friends. Not so. A very well-written page turner that combines very personal, compelling accounts with historical fact and detail wovin in. After reading the book, I looked up the story of the two flyers on You Tube and was quite surprised to find a very touching video documentation re-union of the two enemies 4 decades after the war. Great stuff.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|U can shoot with shells like Mario and there's so many world's  and it's addicting it kills my battery test it
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Purchased to replace the Kindle machine I broke, and works pretty well. No magazines or newspapers, which I miss dearly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i cant connect the game to facebook...i keep getting error and im on a kindle fire...is any one else having this trouble....email me at tamathiam at gmail
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is better than good -it's fantastic!  I missed season 2 (but quickly caught up).  Now I can't wait to see Season 4.  I love the actors, costumes, setting, everything.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is so fun! its like subway surfers but very different and the tracks are creative.sometimes the game was really slow which I had a problem with but it revolted its self.So if you like running games and Despicable me this a great game for you
B00CWY76CC|3.0|not very challenging it is easy to find clues needs more interest in what trying to find or figure out
B00992CF6W|5.0|actually they probably love it too much.  they haven't put it down since i bought it for them 3 days ago.  i
B00181JGI2|5.0|This movie is great. It will be and I'm sure already is iconic. The dude rules!!<br />A must see,  this movie is fun and let's you escape reality for a while.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|For some reason, I have always avoided Mr. King' s books.  The subject matter of this book fascinated me, so I have now read one of his books.  I will read more.  I recommend this book to anyone who has to read a historical novel for school or to anyone who is interested in history.  Just a great book, and I hope they make a movie.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Excellent !!! Love the cast, really can make you think as well as entertain. This is well worth the price.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|What I liked most was the perspective the author took in telling the story of World War Z.  The different points of view telling the same story was a nice alternative to typical narratives. Also, the way Mr. Brooks explores the physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual affects the war had and still has on humanity was enlightening.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game yet. I am so addicted to it. I can't put it down. You should download this game. It is free.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Hey for free, it is a good escape game. I wish there were more like it. I like that it did not rely on a lot of Math type puzzles, where you have to add up a bunch of numbers or look for number patterns, to figure out the solution. To me, that is an easy cop-out to a puzzle game.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|This is so stupid !!! It doesn't even give you instructions how to play !!! And it dissent even get you nowhere in playing the game !!!!
B005COO1X6|1.0|Sort of a Christine rip off. Not sure if Mr King is running out of ideas, but killer cars, is really a dumb idea for a story. There was no real explanation to why the car had its power, and why it ate people. Don't waste your time on this one.
B003DNN0L2|4.0|First off, I had no idea it was based on a work by Ronald Dahl.  That was an unexpected bonus.<br />Excellent voice acting by a host of marquee actors, The film was a fun surprise.  It had enough<br />depth to keep it interesting and the style of the film was well suited to its subject matter.  I would<br />recommend you give it a try.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It's written simply, but it draws you in even if you're not into S&M and all that other stuff.  Hot!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Got so far and now will not let me play till  I updated the game.  But Amazon does not have an update.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|total crap new update ruined it.. it was a great app now its got ads buy me crap it junk I deleated it. installed weather bug .. its much better like this used to be .. even the graphics such looks cheap as hell don't bother.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This used to be a great app!  What happened the change was just to much and it now feels like a social slash ad app.  Wife could not find the pollen report.  Evernote kept popping up because I added something to it once from the New app?  Sorry Accu-Weather for now!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I both loved and hated this book in turn. I really hope that people like Amy do not really exist, I did not like her, even though at first I could not see where the story was going, I nursed a deep suspicion about Amy . Nick seems at the very least odd, disconnected, entitled, and emotionally stunted. I wonder if the situation as developed by the author could have been possible if Nick had been more connected, more aware of the difficulties he created for himself. It is a mad. Crazy story, peopled by characters I hope I will never encounter. However, I will read Gillian Flynn again. She is a master.
B005SAP45I|4.0|Beautiful special effects and really interesting in how tjey incorporated car life into diff locations of the world. The story was more exciting than the last one, though could've been better.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like it. my kid (3 yo) loves to watch me playing it, really entertaining. I don 't know about the shop buy so far I haven't needed to buy anything.
B009VA1FN6|2.0|I have been reading this book - tedious with some scattered parts of interest. The pacing of the plot is just too slow to keep you interested. I got half way through it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I absolutely love this and highly recommend the Kindle.  It is fast, pictures are incredibly clear with so many features.  Speed in amazing - What else can I say but if you are thinking of getting a Kindle - this is the one
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Okay game, pretty short although all of these games seem that way.  Hidden objects were a little hard to see at times. Overall it's decent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|addicting cant get off this game some times when you buy it it might take a little time to download but its worth waiting good for kids I know because I'm a kid myself
B0063GORYU|5.0|good touch screen play on kindle fire. undo button lets you experiment before committing. the price is right. an essential tool for insomniacs.
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you're looking for a realistic portrayal of life in a big city lawfirm, keep going; this one isn't that.  What it IS, however, constitutes fantasy - and tightly-written story lines.  Boring would not be a word one would attach to this series.  I'll be starting with Season 2 shortly.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is the first book by William Landay that I've read and it was really enjoyable.  It kept me interested from the beginning and unable to put it own as the ending loomed.  I will read his other novels, although I usually prefer historical fiction.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. A great humaness movie. An unusual friendship.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great app faotd. wouldn't mind paying for it though. must play once if you're a fan of the minions and want some fast paced fun on the run.
B0063IH60K|5.0|So easy to play.  I have not played solitaire in years.  Now I think I am hooked.  I have played every night for a week.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is great for my kindle fire. It helps me keep track of how long it will last or how long it will take to finish charging it.
B005AUWY90|3.0|This movie is ok for older kids, but we were quite shocked as we took our four year old to see it, who loved the first Cars movie. We would have appreciated a little warning that they are extremely different.  It's basically an animated Mission Impossible spy flick complete with torture, murder, oh and a Hollywood commentary on Big Bad Oil.  Upsides, mater steals the show, international storyline is great and the animation is fantastic.  I don't recommend it for small children, but overall not a bad movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Sometimes challenging, sometimes easy. Really fun game that makes you think about what you're looking at. Would be better if there was an alert telling you the door was open without going back. Other than that....Love the concept...Love the game!
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is an instant classic sure to snap you out of the toddler film blues. In addition to excellent art and writing...the story line truly aids children, and maybe some adults, in dealing with the natural fear of monsters.  It's funny, exciting, and well rounded.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|Wonderful idea for a movie. Loved seeing all of the old school video game references and the movie didn't fall short on storyline either.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|There is mutual respect between the family and the household staff.  Unlike today in America where there is no respect for anyone or anything.  If you have values, then you will appreciate this series!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was a fun time. i just wish there was more levels. addicting for me as someone who loves puzzles.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|The first book in this series was excellent, the second book completely boring, and this one well, right when it started to get good it was over.  What happened in the war?  What happened after the war?  Did the resistance win?  Who did Lena choose?  Very frustrating!
B00785P2QC|1.0|I had a HUGE city and I logged on and it never loaded.So I waited until the next day and it still wouldn't load . That's why I don't like this game
B002YMWPUA|5.0|To say I loved &#34;Hunger&#34; is to say I appreciate its unblinking spotlight on the horrific travesty of justice which forced Bobby Sands to make the ultimate sacrifice for the cause of equal human rights for the Irish people in their own country.  At times I could  hardly bear to watch the abuse he and his comrades suffered or to witness the conditions under which they were forced to endure while &#34;on the blanket&#34; in their &#34;dirty protest.&#34;  But watch I did:  if he could endure it, then the least I could do was witness it.  Shame on those who made such protests necessary.  Well-done Michael Fassbender for persisting in holding our fingers down to the hot braille your film represents.
B000V39KDO|4.0|Action packed, good plot, and based on true events. Enjoyable entertainment with a good cast who performed well throughout the movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|How did I not watch this when it was originally aired? We watched season 1, 2, & 3 all in a week! Addicting show!!!
B005LAIH9A|5.0|fits in perfectly with the rest of the American pie movies. Very funny, it's great to see the gang back together one last time.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Most of the current \\"in\\" videos are there as are classic & a fairly wide selection.  Currently the best working at video streaming anything on my kindle fire hd.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|I wish I could give it 0 stars because it sucks that bad. There is no way to win. There's no tutorial or how to play. All it does is make you frustrated. I have almost 400 apps on my phone and this is the worst one. Even the bloatware is better than this. Not even worth it for free. Uninstall
B00B9366VO|5.0|I have heard the studio name &#34;Sound City&#34; mentioned before in the back history of Nirvana and knew that it held some sort of significance in Rock and Roll history but never knew were to explore it further.  This film lays the entire history of the studio out with in-depth and interesting contributions from some of Rock and Roll's biggest icons who have recorded at Sound City.  This is a &#34;Must-Watch&#34; for any fan of Rock and Roll.  Enjoy!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|My mother originally got me hooked on the crime show genre, and we have watched every episode of N.C.I.S. Seasons 1-9 from library DVD rentals and have watched all episodes of season 10 here on amazon! A great show that has the ability to bring families together to watch.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|Ordered this for a friend, and she loves it!  I will be watching this movie soon.  Thanks Amazon for a great movie!
B00992CF6W|4.0|this app was great but the pc version is a lot more updated but it is still really awesome. One thing I think that Mojang should ad is Redstone because when you mine it you get nothing.<br /><br />  This has been a review from some GUY
1423136802|5.0|This large set was bought for my 9 year old daughter to 'encourage' her to read throughout the summer holidays.... book 1 was started during the last week of term and the entire series was polished off with great enthusiasm before the 4th  of July fireworks!!! So much for a summer long investment but huge congratulations to the author for developing characters and amazing storylines which drew her in and captured her imagination... this series managed to secure priority access to her leisure time ahead of both Wii and Xbox.... I just wish there were more books or less summer vacation!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|awesome love waiting for awesome stuff but it just stopped working and i would recomend this for anyone 5 and above
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A tale that ebbs and flows over time of a brother and sister. I am a huge fan of Khaled Hosseini's books. This one took me quite awhile to get into, yet I found it very good.
B008220BP2|5.0|Romeo and Juliet meets zombies - the most brutal battle between two families you can have. It's funny, adorable, exciting, and heart-warming. Highly Recommended.
0989524116|5.0|I was hooked into Outin on the last page of Outview but the story never let go.  It's fascinating to see the author take ancient philosophies and weave them into a contemporary thriller.  The Universe and time are both like subtle characters which adds another level of depth to this already magically complex story.<br />Highly recommended.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My girls love this game.  They play it all the time.  Was easy to download didn't take too long like most games.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I HAVE NEVER READ OR HEARD OF THE POWER OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND IN OUR LIVES.  THIS BOOK IS LIFE CHANGING
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The game was brilliant, cannot wait for the next room, the puzzles were well thought out and very difficult to solve, thankfully they provided clue to help
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Oh my gawd. this was one of the best books I've ever read by Rick Riordan. He is an amazing author, and like I said this book is amazing. There is so many surprises, and a suspenseful ending that really surprised. This book is a must read.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|It is amazing to me that the devs can &quot;work hard&quot; on a product,  test it,  research it and still put out such a worthless product.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that if you love temple run or subway suffers this is a unique game with awesome levels reasons:<br />1.fun to play<br />2.great for kids to play<br />3. it has MINIONS!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Please hurry with new levels!<br /> Stretches the brain without being frustratingly complicated.<br />Recommend and would pay for game if more levels were available.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|get it it is fun and not a waste of time awesome buy it get it free awesome fun cool
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I just downloaded this app and it is already freezing. I'm trying to play a video in my Favorites and it says vTube has stopped working.. please fix this. I don't know what other YouTube app to use.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|This movie was amazingly well written, directed, and acted. The story made me think very hard. I was rather stunned at the end, for it left me with all these feelings, and thoughts. I found myself throughout the movie relating deeply to Yentl with her curious nature, and hunger for knowledge. I feel this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love despicable me this game is a lot like subway suffers but better a whole lot more missions to complete and the minions are solo cute!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Game is very good. Easy yet tricky enough to keep your attention.  Only thing I would like see changed is where you stop when you are out of fuel.  I wish it would play all the way out.  When it stops you right before you hit a gas tank is annoying.  But great game overall.
B009IJJ712|5.0|A very refreshing adaptation full of interesting twists and rather realistic characters (as realistic as a SH adaptation can get) with believable personalities. Heavy on the character development, in a very good way. Reads like a procedural cop show at first, becomes anything but. A very nice, diverse cast.
B004NS7120|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat! Very good film. I will buy it next week. I keep adding more words so my review can be published.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I had bought a small camera at a yard sale and couldn't find the right size memory card in any stores.  This was what I was looking for and now I can carry my new camera in my purse and not miss a thing.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|What an excellent movie!  The animation was top notch, and then story was a mix of drama and comedy.  Just great!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Graphics GREAT, fun to play when I have only a few minutes. Good exercise for my eyes and my mind too!
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Great album from top to bottom.  &#34;preacher&#34; has been on repeat on my computer for two days.  Get this album!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It's not bad just a few glitches and it's free but it lets you buy things with real money<br />MUST  buy!!!!!!!!!!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This novel was hard to put down and is responsible for many times not getting to sleep when I initially thought I would.
B000I9U75G|5.0|The movie was really pretty good, but the soundtrack is great. Do not miss the music in the closing credits. The take on Led Zep is fantastic, and Bowie's \\"Heroes\\" is smooth. Turn it up!
B0089PJFFY|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading this diary.<br />I feel like I know Anne personally. I would recommend<br />this book to anyone because of the history<br />behind this girl and her family.
0812416805|5.0|I first picked up this book when I was in 6th grade on the recommendation of my teacher (he said \\"YOU will enjoy it and get a lot out of it\\") and have read it every year since then. Four years of advanced English in high school and it was the one book I read out of the 4 books per year assigned. Then in college it was yet assigned again and I enjoyed the book yet again.<br />There is so much to learn from this book. I get something new everytime I pick it up and thoroughly enjoy the story everytime. Every character in this book are wonderfully written. I even took the time to watch a documentary about the book and the movie. Found it interesting that the character Dill is based off of Truman Capote who was childhood friends with Harper Lee.<br />Atticus is full of knowledge that he passes on to his children such as: don't judge a person unless you step into their shoes and walk around in them and it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because they don't harm anyone but sing beautiful songs. I always see Tom Robinson as that mockingbird because he hasn't done anything wrong.<br />My favorite part is in front of the jailhouse when the lynching mob comes for Robinson and Atticus is sitting there waiting for them. It is the innocence of childhood that stops the mob from proceeding with Scout saying Ain't you Walter's pa...could you say hey to him. That little bit of her acknowledging his boy in such a positive light is enough for him to turn to the others and say they should leave and go home.<br />I have to purchase another copy as my copy is so worn that 3/4 of the pages have fallen out making it difficult to read anymore and I want to enjoy it again.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|This is a great show. I never get tired of watching. I cannot wait for the new season to come out. :)
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Just finishing up season one and will watch the rest of the seasons! Great acting and good plots! Don't miss it!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|good game. This is a game that can be played for hours. Numerous levels and patterns make it addicting for all.
B00BJLJIWK|5.0|I pre-ordered this, waiting to hear what it sound like in multichannel before investing in any of the other Doors SACD's that came out in June 2013. After hearing this one-I ordered \\"Strange Days\\". After my wife heard the first 2 she wanted \\"Morrison Hotel\\" as she loves \\"Indian Summer\\" and wanted to hear it in multichannel. I was glad I had read a previous review of a re-master that noted the speed change on \\"Light my Fire\\" as I noticed the pitch was changed and it was definitely a shade faster than the other versions I own. The surround mix is awesome, with Jim's vocals on center channel and various passages highlighted on the rear left and right channels. I have read some reviewers distain of such sharp separation of guitar riffs, piano or organ solos' etc. but I find them quite enjoyable and that they add to the \\"surrounded by music\\" ambiance. I realize some are looking for concert hall sound reverb and reflection, but if you liked the SACD's of Elton John, Dire Straits \\"Brothers in Arms\\" or Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" you will find much to love about these new Doors releases. I also listened to the stereo mix on my computer through Logitech's THX rated 2.1 speakers and found the clarity to be excellent. This album and \\"Strange Days\\" offer, to me, the most listenable songs per album than any other of the Doors albums. I love some songs on Morrison Hotel and LA Woman, but not every song like this album and \\"Strange Days\\".
B003Y5USG4|5.0|This movie is awesome. I makes you feel you are right there. The effects make the movie. Actors are great too!!!
B00902UH5M|5.0|tommy hafey (a famous former Australian rules football Victorian Football League player and coach) came to the office one day as a surprise guest. Tommy has this amazing personality which kept everyone entertained throughout his speech. At the end he says: \\"Its all about that burning desire guys. And if you haven't read the latest book of Arnold... which I can't remember the title now... \\". Then I snapped: \\"Total Recall!\\"... \\"Yes, yes, that one\\" he said, \\"have a read at it is really good\\".<br /><br />Straight after I bought the kindle version on my ipad.<br /><br />This book is not about a movie star. It's about life! Worth every penny
B00ADS98FC|3.0|It is an alright movie. Singing is good. Actors are good. Would not recommend it for smaller children to watch.
0979019710|5.0|I hesitated to read this book.  I've read hundreds of books on what I thought were similar personal development books.  I was sincerely impressed with MyPal Hal.  He's straightforward and doesn't mince words.  Every word is something that directly relates to achieving the highest level of life success.  I couldn't put the book down and I've loaned it out to many others already.  I set a 1-week time period for them to read it and then ask for them to give it back.  I re-read it in-between loaning it out and encourage everyone to buy it for themselves and do a likewise model of introducing it to everyone they know.  It has made a huge impact on my life.  Being a night-owl for many years, I am surprised how I'm considered an early-bird for everything now!  What a huge change!  The supporting materials (websites, guides, etc.) along with an unparalleled access to Mr. Elrod himself (that shocked me, when he responded to my e-mail personally and quickly!)  Great guy, great book, life changing, buy it now!  The day you receive it, just do what it suggests and you'll reach new levels of performance and reward in every area of your life.  You deserve to live a \\"Level-10 Life\\" and Mr. Elrod will show you EXACTLY how to instill the discipline and practices to get you there.  The S.A.V.E.R.S. alone have dramatically enhanced my effectiveness in all areas of my life.  Thanks Hal!  You are truly \\"MyPal Hal!\\"
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Action packed, fast paced movie, Bruce Willis never lets you down, car wreckers paradise,script a bit ordinary, but it a good day to watch and laugh hard,,,,,,lov it,,,,,,Enjoy,,,,,,,,
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This game not only has great graphics and game play, but actually focuses on learning a very useful lesson. The game is as much about economics as it is about racing a fan boat, and encourages the mantra of &#34;Buy low, sell high.&#34; I highly recommend this game.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I loved this sound track when watching the movie and couldn't wait to get it.  If you like Hawaiian music, the real thing, you will like it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Iron man three is awesome.Iron man is very strong and brave so it makes the game  easier in the game..
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I am a movie fanatic and this movie is a masterpiece, in my opinion.  I have watched it three times and know I will watch it many more times through the years.  George Clooney is like a magician in making this character believable, through many difficult scenes.  Each actor is perfect.  The writing is real and pungent.  The scenery ideal for the story.  The music is perfect.  I can find NOTHING wrong with this film.  It deals with very very difficult and sensitive issues in an honest and profound way.  It is unforgettable.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Great game!!!  Would like to see the game save across devices - iphone to kindle.  The commentary is hilarious too.  Actually would not mind more of it.
B001TODOCM|4.0|It works great.  The only problem was that it started spontaneously beeping at one point, and wouldn't stop.  The seller told me how to fix that, by prying up the little metal tab. That seems to make it work ok. She offered to replace it if it didn't.<br /> It is a huge weight off my mind to know I can find my keys now.  We went on vacation recently and I showed it to people everywhere we went, because everyone complains of losing their keys.  We wanted to make sure we took it with us, and in fact used it once to locate the keys.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun for my two kids to play they really enjoy it thanks for a game that is free and entertaining.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Show: 5 stars.<br />Amazon's streaming service: 3 stars, especially compared to Netflix.<br /><br />Amazon's subtitles are problematic and are the reason I took off a star.<br />-They display after the dialog's been said.<br />-There's no &#34;yellow on transparent&#34; option.  The black boxes around the subtitles aren't as nice looking at Netflix's subtitles.<br /><br />I also find Amazon's interface more cumbersome and awkward to navigate than Netflix's.  Alas, it seems I'm stuck with Amazon streaming as they've bought the rights to this show.
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|Great game, good gameplay, good multiplayer. Only problem is, LAGGY!!!!!. Can't do anything without freezing up and going a frame a sec. Fix it and this game will be worth 15 stars.
B00004RF98|4.0|I know it's probably sacrilegious to admit this, but Singin' in the Rain is not my favorite musical.  Nor do I think it's the greatest musical ever made.  It is a good musical, that's undeniable, at times quite fun and fanciful.  It has a well constructed plot, better than most, and an almost perfect cast.  The dialog is hilarious.  The pace is well maintained throughout, there's barely a pause to take a breath.  My favorite scene is Donald O'Connor's Make `em Laugh number (which reportedly put O'Connor in the hospital afterwards).  It's easy to see why O'Connor won a Golden Globe for Best Actor for this film.  Jean Hagen as the talentless Lina Lamont is nothing short of hysterical.  Debbie Reynolds is effervescent.  Kathleen Freeman as the diction coach is priceless.  And Gene Kelly, well, for a singer he makes a passable dancer.<br /><br />This movie is in my collection but it's not one that I watch often.
B008TRUDAS|2.0|A very slow reading book. I didn't even buy the sequel!  The short poems. This was one of the most boring books I've read
B0058YPG2K|5.0|and this one does not disappoint.  As usual you cannot second guess it and it is brilliant.  I can't wait to see how it all ends.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is very timely. We live in time of many single parent families with absentee fathers. This movie really speaks to the importance of the fathers role in raising their children and setting  a good example of what a father is to be.  I recommend to all Dad's, it makes a man think about how he impacts the lives of his children in very profound ways.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|This were purchased for my son who uses headphones all the time.  He says they are great and just what he wanted
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Hard to put down. Expect to have a late night once you start. Lots of unexpected plot twists.  Well written.
B005544V6A|5.0|People kept telling me I just had to watch Suits. It took me two Seasons to finally say ok........wow!  What I was missing!!  Drama, spins, twists and fantastic acting!  I couldn't get enough! I'm onto Season two and can't wait for the third season to start next week!  I'm definitely hooked on Suits!
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|TERRIBILE MOVIE!!!<br />AVOID AT ALL COSTS!<br />Tom Cruise has got to be embarressed of this disaster.<br />I wish I had never seen tis movie.
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|This album is incredible, every song is almost an experience, i was so overwhelmed the first time i heard it, Armin is a musical genius, Pulsar and Wont Let you go, are extremely addictive songs, i cant get enough of it. Its an excellente record.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I bought this movie for my kids and they really enjoyed the movie and loved it. Good to have in the collections
B00AB7HESI|5.0|love it and have it on the DS too I have been waiting a long time for this<br />game thank goodness
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|I already watched this movie so many time. to get it in bluray i bought this movie. It is great and good movie
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great great awesome game. Time flies when you're playing. From the makers of cut the rope it does not pale in comparison. AND IT'S FREE!!!! If you like cut the rope then you won't be disappointed. Promise!!!!!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I'm a long time Metal Gear fan. I've played every single title, and I've loved every single one. Chances are, if you find yourself here, you are probably a Metal Gear fan, and don't need to be told anything about the superb story. Metal Gear Solid is one of the most interesting and engrossing collection of games spanning across many generations.<br /><br />Disc Two of this collection is the HD Collection (MGS 2, MGS 3, and Peace Walker), plus the two Digital Graphic Novels in movie form. This marks the first time that the Digital Graphic Novels are released in the States. Once you input the disc into your PS3, you will find the Digital Graphic Novels under the videos section of the XMB. This, for me, is worth the price of admission alone. I own a physical copy of the graphic novels, but it's so much better to see them in action with full voice overs.<br /><br />Disc One is Metal Gear Solid IV. No frills, no extras.<br /><br />The voucher was not working earlier today, but this was a mess up on Sony's part. The scheduled PlayStation Store update came much later than usual. The voucher nets you Metal Gear Solid, and Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions. This also marks the debut of the VR Missions on the PS3 and PSN. I'm not sure if it'll be sold as a stand-alone, but it might happen.<br /><br />The 100 page art book is the size of a blu-ray case. It has a neat collection of promotional materials for all games of the Metal Gear Solid series. It's not hardcover, but it does have a neat embossed cover. All in all it's pretty great.<br /><br />If you're not all that interested in the Digital Graphic Novels, then you could pass this collection up. Essentially, what you are getting here is a repackaged HD Collection, and a repackaged Metal Gear Solid IV. It's really awesome to have almost every single game in one box, but I can understand why some people would not be eager to double-triple, or maybe even quadruple dip.<br /><br />I, for one, am very happy with my purchase. 50 bucks is cheap for 8 games and 2 Digital Graphic Novels.<br /><br />The entire list of games is as follows:<br /><br />Metal Gear (Accessed through the Metal Gear Solid 3 menu)<br /><br />Metal Gear 2 (Accessed through the Metal Gear Solid 3 menu)<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid (Digital only)<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions (Digital Only)<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 2: HD Edition<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 3: HD Edition<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 4<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker<br /><br />as well as:<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid: Bande Dessinee (Digital Graphic Novel)<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 2: Bande Dessinee (Digital Graphic Novel)ks is cheap for 8 games and 2 Digital Graphic Novels.<br /><br />The entire list of games is as follows:<br /><br />Metal Gear (Accessed through the Metal Gear Solid 3 menu)<br /><br />Metal Gear 2 (Accessed through the Metal Gear Solid 3 menu)<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid (Digital only)<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions (Digital Only)<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 2: HD Edition<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 3: HD Edition<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 4<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker<br /><br />as well as:<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid: Bande Dessinee (Digital Graphic Novel)<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 2: Bande Dessinee (Digital Graphic Novel)
B007A4SDCG|5.0|It's almost as if Pressfield can hear that little, nagging, negative voice in your head and in a way he can since its not all that different from his own. In simple, practical ways Pressfield points out the dangers in listening to that voice and practical ways to conquer it, I thoroughly enjoyed 'The War of Art' and don't doubt I'll return to its pages again and again. A must read for any artist!!
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|These books make sense to me and need to be available to everyone. The meal menus are everyday choices in some cases. I think everybody who tries this could find themselves like me taking note of what I was eating or about to eat and having second thoughts and going for the healthy option.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|Very good gets right to the point..... Hands down the best horror movie that I have seen in a long time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|WOW!!!! This game is intense, I ALWAYS GO FOR SLOT GAMES , I HAVE MORE FUN ON THIS THAN ANY GAME FOR A LONG TIME. It's a must have
B009AMANH4|5.0|Daniel Day -Lewis was in a word...&#34;phenomenal&#34;.  I almost felt as if I was with Mr. Lincoln during the time preceeding his unfortuate death.  All the actors were superb, but DDL stood alone.
B009NY43NY|4.0|This book was good just not as detailed and in depth as her other books. I also hate for them to be over.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Great game. Stays connected and moves as fast as I do on removals etc. I have enjoyed this much better than any other Mahjong games available.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love this app great graphics makes this game one of the best , also I love the original game too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|get this app its really fun there are minons that use tart guns :-) also there is a.rocket that u can fly on!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This Game Is Way Better Than Temple Run And Subway Surfer.It Is Both Of Them Combined.YOU NEED THIS GAME IN YOUR LOFE RIGHT NOW!!!!!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I like the many configurations and games on this one!  Would recommend!!  Great time consumer when waiting and takes my mind away from stressful events.  It's my way to relax away from home.  It works!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game the minions are so cute. This game keeps me entertained and it is really addicting I can't stop playing it.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Hill climb racing is an ok game I used to play on my friends games but then I found it for my self.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Loved 'Skyfall'. Was a little surprised (pleasingly) by the ending, Not at the loss of 'M', but at the &#34;resetting&#34; of the original Bond feel. The next installment can't come soon enough.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play this game all the time, it's so fun. I have watched both movies and they are my two favorite movies! YOU should get this game:)!!!!!!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|We were not disappointed, as usual Bruce Willis delivered lots of action with his unique sense of humor surrounded by an exceptional cast. Looking forward to Red II.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|it was fun at first but then there was an update and when I went to update it it said open instead of free so I had to delete it and start all my hard work again and I also paid money on it to purchase better stuff and I played as a guest
B008B8AOQI|5.0|This young English singer/songwriter is headed for greatness. He writes and sings from the heart.  He is a great inspiration to me.  He has both a beautiful voice and Soul.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i really enjoyed the game only wish there were more levels.it wasn't too hard nor too easy but challenging at some points.
B00846TRHY|4.0|Pretty good flick actually. A little cheeses in parts but overall good storyline on a real guy doing good work with orphans in Southern Sudan. At 3.99 through Amazon, you definitely get your money's worth.
1781162646|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long while. I laughed, cried, and enjoyed every minute of it. It's touching, serious, and well written. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good story.
B00969GFFU|4.0|Franzen's attempt to write a 21st century Tolstoy-style novel almost works except that in Tolstoy's day there was no widespread discussion of the issues so it made sense to have Tolstoy's characters debate land possession, the rights of the proletariat and so on, but today we have the internet where the pros and cons of population growth, the Iraq War, or the Environment have already been thrashed to a halt, and so when Franzen repeats them in this novel, they don't carry the same weight and I skipped all the political sections.<br /><br />What Franzen is so good at is family relations and for me, a female, he gives a wondrous look into the masculine mind and sexual drive. Anne Tyler, who insists on writing novels from the male point of view should read this book closely.<br /><br />I found both the sex-crazed Richard and the anal retentive Walter more convincing than the heroine, Patty, whose later persona as a mixed up mother and wife does not follow well from her teenage years as an outstanding athlete.<br /><br />Still, Jonathan is a formidable writer and I think deserves all the accolades.<br />Freak Out! My Life with Frank Zappa
1781162646|1.0|Joyland was an awful book and not a joy to read. i struggled to finish it and do not understand other peoples' good reviews.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It's a good app you can say, it is very easy to use my kindle and listen to music nice app!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I found this book to be different than I expected. I couldn't put it down. Each chapter had something unexpected. The communication with flowers was so deep. There was never a boring area. I really liked this book and recommend it to others.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|My daughter enjoys this game, very fun and simple if your kids like to play hair salon games,especially when you are going in a trip.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I do not like the new foremat for the weather channel! The old foremat was much more User friendly and informational. I will be installing a different app to get my weather!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a good game for every one to play and it is free so that makes it even better
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Love the series. Haven't watched the TV version and don't expect to anytime soon. The complex web of relations in these books piques the same interest in me as genealogy--another passion. Martin's writing is glass--clear, allowing the reader to see straight through to the characters or action. Hats off.<br />  I hear a few rumblings about how depressing the books are. To me, that's the beauty. Life is light AND dark. Martin doesn't baby the reader. He also handles the pacing of the books well. Makes me happy to be able to order the next digital book at 2am if I need to. If you liked Lord of the Rings or Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you'll probably like this series.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|This story is told with such sensitivity and frankness that the reader lives each moment with Harold, and feels deep sympathy for his struggle to come to terms with his tragic past.  Ms Joyce has touched a deep well of humanity and has given us characters, especially Harold, that we believe in and sympathise and empathise with to such a degree that we care for them as we would someone we love.  Poignancy is the hallmark of this tale.<br /><br />Reading this to the end, I was left with the feeling that I wanted to say, &#34;Well done Harold and Maureen for your heroic struggle to come to terms with each other and your shared, but difficult past, and for seeing a future together that doesn't seek to obliterate, but rather looks to honour, memory, and will go forward from there.&#34;  So, then, well done, Ms Joyce for giving us such a story!
B008OM0EDO|2.0|I am not easily shocked or offended, but this movie fails to grasp the subtle distinction between tacky and funny.  This movie would appeal only to boys in their early teens.  The only parts that were somewhat funny were used in the previews.
B000683VI4|1.0|I love this movie, ordered it with a few others so took me a while before I tried it. The movie would not play. I tried it on three different DVD players with no luck. Wouldnt order from them again.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|The master of course. Still a majestic mystery of how this happened. But it did...he's still with us. Peace, Love & Happiness echoes through the Universe.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|big Fan Of All Kanye Albums, But This Is PrettyBad. Plus, 10 Songs Should Be A Half Album. Go Be With Big Booty Kim, kanye
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill climb is the coolest game in the wold its fun easy and hard at the same time I recommend you get the app before its to late and its FREE!!!!!
B007REV4T8|4.0|Daniel Craig is unique as James Bond. Distinct from prior James Bond Actors. Enjoyable and unpredictable movie! I highly recommend this dvd.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book was fascinating.  Not only did it help me understand myself, I am gently more aware of those around me, particularly my dear grandchildren and how they are developing.  Though the topic appears to be about introverts, it heightened my appreciation and admiration of extroverts!  How wonderful that we can all function together so beneficially.  Thank you.
B00BZBP44K|5.0|Ghandi was a great figure, like Martin Luther King, he had a vision, and he changed the world with his ideas of non-violent passive resistance, compromise and fairness. Ben Kingsley played the role with sensitivity and brilliance. I think he would acknowledge that it was the performance of his career. The movie deserved every Oscar it won.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Only complaint is certain things are too expensive ,besides that love it. Can't wait for the upcoming pc version. Dinos are great and new updates look fun. Be sure to have tons of friends to help with tasks makes it a lot easier.
0307454568|5.0|I needed this book to complete the three book series.  Got an excellent buy on a used (very lightly used) book.  I enjoyed this third one as much as the first in the series.  I would rate the 'Dragon Tatto' and this one as very good to excellent.  The second book in the series  'Played with Fire' was just 'good'.  It dragged a bit - I thought.  Very enjoyable series - a bit quirky, entertaining, and good action!
B00338QELU|4.0|It's rare to find such a good combination of literary qualities and thriller appeal. Psychological and social analyses abound (to the point of digressions) , including global international politics. They take us from Sweden to Beijing to London to African countries through a plot that slowly develops. Recent and less recent parts of history of China and the US are also neatly tied into the plot. The plot itself has all the good ingredients that  will  keep you turning the pages, it gets darker and more brutal,  and with more and more global ramifications. it accelerates in an intense grand finale where madness is is not absent.  The main character is very human, not a hero nor a one dimensional character. She has a life and personal issues greater than just her accidental,  willy-nilly  implication in this story. My only frustration is with the lack of explanation for a couple of elements, which diminishes the cathartic ending. Still, a great reading.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun. Not hard and its giving me some new ideas for hiding places. Now if I could just get an elevator in my house!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Easy to fall asleep listening to it. I use this app when I am over tired and need to sleep. It calms the nerves and puts your mind at ease.
B002NPUCIA|5.0|Great and super funky dvd from Mr. Culbertson. Fantastic music, great sound and also a very sympathetic inside view of Mr. Culbertson's musical life.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I liked the book, but was worn out by all the defeated characters.  ..... Had to keep reading to see &#34;who dunit&#34;.  Liked the twist at the end.  Flynn  is a very gifted author.
1452101248|5.0|This book is awesome!!  It gives you so many ideas for multiple items!!  I'm excited to host a party!! yum!!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I think that the best way to say this is this game is not fun I think it is a terrible idea.
1439102813|5.0|I read this book to try to understand what it must feel like to have early onset Alzheimer's.  It was excellent.  Very well written and really puts you inside the head of someone with this very difficult disease.  Highly recommend.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|My wife and daughter had the pleasure of seeing Hugh Laurie in concert in Iowa City, Iowa.  Enjoying the CD as it takes them back to that evening.  Also ordered his next CD which is to come out in August.  Can't wait!
B000FBJG04|5.0|I was never much of a history buff until I saw the Band of Brothers episodes on HBO.  Peaked my interest in reading the book and then a trip to Normandy to see the beaches and take the Band of Brothers tour with Overlord Tours.  Now I can't get enough!  The book is great - gives awesome details about the characters and the battles.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Love the color and the texture  of the movie, it really was a perfect compliment to the original Wizard of Oz.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Did not download on my Kindle fire 2 so I never played it. sorry i can not give a review for this.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter my favorite serial killer is back for a 7th season. Looking forward to watching it, I hope that it is as fantastic as previous seasons.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Fearless showed the way towards  overcoming adversity and having faith in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Adam's life was a true witness to his Christian faith.
B008PEXCBM|5.0|It's a musical version of Romeo and Juliet, with New York Gangs. My kids 6 and 8 love the music from it and so we rented it. They both liked it a lot. And, of course my wife and I did too. The movie won 10 Oscars and you'll recognize most of the songs, as they are iconic (Tonight, Maria, I Feel Pretty).
B003E2UQMS|4.0|I loved the way in which the characters overcame their day to day struggles. Loved it much more than the movie.
B00A83075M|5.0|i love it because it shows children even bad people can behave as good.  Also there is possible a change if a person is willing to try it.
B005GQ5HB0|5.0|I felt much more of a personal connection with the characters instead of a metaphorical view of the struggles war victims and perpetrators alike must have felt.<br /><br />I was captivated and the moral issues addressed really gets you thinking.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys coming of age stories.  Great character development and easy to visualize the events while reading.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|Usually I have no desire to see a movie after having read the book on which it was based .  I read Cloud Atlas first and then was pleasantly surprized when I also enjoyed the movie.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Great movie. A little slow in the beginning but that sets up the characters very well. Wonderful colors and well laid out. The whole family enjoyed it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Words can't describe. It's a fascinating read. Stay out of my life!  I've been there to some level. I feel the pain of the past from this book. I long for the happily ever after that I ended up with in reality. On to the next book!
B00AQ2G7D6|5.0|A classic!!!!!!  The second version does not come close. Pierce Brosnan attempting to take a role played by the King?  Are you kidding me?
B00AVFO41K|5.0|ONG. I love this game. l love this game. I love it. I don't care it is fun. I have not played not yet.
B00542X2DQ|1.0|My 16 year old daughter is an aspiring pastry chef and received the Miette cookbook as a gift.  She made the hot milk cake twice (following the directions to a T) only to have it fall grotesquely in the center both times. It was very heartbreaking to be witness to such disappointment. However after reading most of the reviews here it was a comfort to know that it wasn't  a lack of attention to detail that caused for the failures.  I agree the book is very pretty but as we all know.... we can't judge a book by its cover or its scalloped edges.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My grandson loves playing minecraft and loves Legos when he found out there was a Lego Minecraft  he requested it for his birthday now you need to make a minecraft backpack.It arrived on time in great shape.
0596805888|5.0|Jeff Potter's approach to food and cooking is much the same as he must have approached computer science studies at Brown University, using a logic-based, well-researched, slightly academic approach.  He starts the book with the explanation, \\"We geeks are fascinated by how things work, and most of us eat too.\\"<br /><br />Cooking for Geeks is an expansive book, nearly 400 pages, written for digesting much like a 14 course meal, to be broken down into manageable bites with time to reflect in between chapters. It begins with the basic tools a good cook needs, paring them down to only the essentials and then steadily progresses to more complex topics such as sous vide and cooking with liquid nitrogen and dry ice. He frequently cites research done on different techniques so if you want to do more research on your own, there is a starting point.<br /><br />Most interesting are the many interviews Potter has sprinkled within the chapters from a wide range of \\"geeks\\" who are experts in a particular area sharing their unique take that can be related back to the kitchen. From Adam Savage, of Mythbuster's fame, on scientific testing, Adam Ried from America's Test Kitchen on equipment and recipes to Herv&eacute; This, a French physical chemist at the Institut National de la Recherch&eacute; Agronomique, on molecular gastronomy, Potter allows each of these experts a forum to succinctly regale the reader with their particular expertise as an accent to the topic.<br /><br />Cooking for Geeks also includes some science experiments to illustrate the techniques and help readers to actively participate and get excited about the concepts within. Potter also shares his experiences with preparing some of the dishes he breaks down in the book and there are many recipes throughout to try.<br /><br />His fascination with the way things work is interesting and infectious enough to make even non-geeks spend some time reading this book. As a foodie and science buff, I can highly recommend his book for those of us who aren't satisfied only knowing the \\"whats\\" but want to delve into the \\"whys\\" of cooking.e of us who aren't satisfied only knowing the \\"whats\\" but want to delve into the \\"whys\\" of cooking.
B005M5PER2|5.0|This is a great show, I love all of the characters. They have very different styles and personalities but work great together. I'm not big into police shows but this one I like because of the great acting and the awesome setting of Hawaii. Love the shots of the islands. High action, highly entertaining show.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Good movie, very entertaining. For some reason though the volume was very low and very hard to hear, probably a streaming issue.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book is just great.it contains many facts about tesla some I knew and some I didn't. Also in my opinion contains a great message
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I wanted to see this in the theater but missed my chance.  Glad I finally got to view it at home. Good show
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very cool and different game. I love this movie and love the little minions. There are a lot of little tricks.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|a little darker than the last couple, yet quality hard rock as only quotsa can,  by the best hard rock band actually the best band since 2000
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|We love The Piano Guys at our house.  It is music we can all agree on, and with three teenagers that's saying something!
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I only finished it because I felt compelled to at least get my entire rental-fee's worth out of it.  It still took me 3 viewing sessions to finish the movie in its entirety as I would just get too bored to continue.
B00C7NKPPS|4.0|I always liked Paul solo and fully enjoyed the Band on the Run album.  I typically do not like &#34;live&#34; recordings, so that maybe is why I did not &#34;love&#34; it.  I have fonder memories from the Band on the Run Album.  I'll try to buy a CD of that.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I have the game on my iPhone and enjoy playing it, but when I try to play it on my Kindle Fire it gets stuck kn the loading screen. Once it gets stuck I have to power down my kindle to get out of the app because all the controls are gone. I would enjoy playing it if it worked, but on the kindle it just doesn't.
B004ZQRFGM|5.0|This is the third of her CD's I have and I am not disappointed.  I love how she mixes blues, jazz, rock and classical (?).  Her lyrics are meaningful and she mixes everything beautifully.  A true talent.<br /><br />The cover art work would be demeaning to me  as an Artist as she should be looked at as a gifted musician and not eye candy.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Bingo Blitz is too much glitz and not enough substance.  Too many parachutes dropping and stars flashing.  Would prefer a basic bingo game.
B00CW665VI|5.0|The lines in this book were genius...yep genius. My favorite: \\"And for God's sake, don't let her watch Cinderella. What kind of example is that? A mindless twit who can't remember where she left her damn shoe, so she has to wait for some douchebag in tights to bring it to her? Give me a friggin' break.\\" (Drew)Omfg too funny. Oh and \\"Any other time, any other girl, i would bury Warren. Without even trying. he can't hold a candle to me. I'm a goddamn Porsche; he's a pickup truck that can't pass inspection.\\" (Drew) HA. Okay, I could keep quoting all day the fabulous lines in this book, but I think you better read it for yourself. What a refreshing love story in the guy's POV. Being in his head was so much fun. And Kate, yes a heroine that rocks--strong, sassy, has backbone and still vulnerability. Wonderful read, thank you Emma Chase
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Excellent cinematography, acting, character development, and story.  The fictional portrayal of events actually does coincide with some historical events during that time period....fascinating.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Good game play and graphics.  Scenes are challenging and pinball physics feel real.  Only negatives are the small screen and lack of good instructions.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Certain levels are hard you have to tap everything just to find the items. Good challenges though. Nice for free application just need more levels...
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I've read these books and short stories many times and they never cease to entertain me.  Sherlock is always my first love!!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have tried many note apps, but this is by far the best note app out there!!! I highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazing game my friend recommended it and I downloaded it and I beat my friend on Facebook. You should download
B009XIXVU6|3.0|After being completely enthralled with Hosseini's previous books, I was so looking forward to this one. But, it was disappointing. Lots of skipping around among characters and throughout time, but it just didn't come together as he may have intended.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a really good book . I really liked it maybe because Charlie's different from others and I liked that . I would recommed it . I'm hoping to watch the movie Simon.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the way this book switches from the perspective of the wife and then the husband. It will keep you in suspense all the way to the end.
B00AB7IA1S|5.0|I could not put it down! I love this app because of the challenges that it gives me. Worth the money 100% of the way.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|How much do you (or anyone) know about life in North Korea? This wonderfully written book of stories from those who escaped will help you to understand what life is like for the many who suffer endlessly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is a cute interesting fun game. It can get somewhat challenging but I love a good challenge. I enjoy it.
B000FC12Z0|2.0|I had never read an Agatha Christie book so I though I'd give it a try. This was probably not the best one to start with. I found it quite boring.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would like to qualify that and say that I'm sure I would love it even more if I could understand it. In other words...if it were closed captioned. When we watched the original series on PBS, the dialogue was closed captioned. I'm sure the reason Amazon doesn't offer this is due to the additional expense. And, since the series is available free to Prime members, I suppose I shouldn't complain. However, I hope that one day, if enough hearing impaired individuals echo my sentiments, that Amazon and others will make this service available to its viewers. It would be greatly appreciated.
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|I would love to have given this a higher rating but unfortunately, I never got to play it. For some reason, when I'd turn my kindle one way, the screen stayed upside down. When I flipped it the other direction, it flipped upside down yet again. I never could get the the screen to stay right and as this never happens with any other app I have, I can only assume it's a glitch in game.
0765325950|5.0|Fantastic book so far (about half way through).  Jordan is the genius behind this series and I don't want to take anything away from him.  But the middle books in this series were not nearly as much fun to read as the first few, or the last ones written by Sanderson.  The last 3 were just such a pleasure to read!
B0027MJU00|4.0|An interesting read with an unexpected twist to the ending not as good as gone girl but worth your time to read
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|BBC America's critically acclaimed sci-fi thriller Orphan Black: Season One arrives on DVD and Blu-Ray on Tuesday July 16th, 2013 starring Tatiana Maslany (\\"Ghost\\" in Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed), who recently won a Critic's Choice Television Award.<br /><br />Tatiana Maslany plays Sarah Manning, a young woman who grew up as an orphan and is now a con artist/thief. She's in shock when she witnesses the suicide of her look-alike Detective Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" Childs, whom just happens to leave her purse containing her identification. Being a con artist, Sarah takes over Beth's identity, mostly to clear out Beth's bank accounts before the authorities learn of her death; plus, Sarah is trying to runaway from ex-boyfriend. She hopes the money is enough for her to start a new life with her seven-year-old daughter, Kira.<br /><br />The longer Sarah stays as Beth, the more dangerous her life becomes as she learns there are more look-alikes, a housewife, a science nerd, and a crazy assassin. Allied with her foster brother, Felix, and two of her chameleons, Sarah is determined to figure out what is going on and who she really is.<br /><br />Episodes on the 3-disc DVD are:<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />Natural Selection<br /><br />Instinct<br /><br />Variation Under Nature<br /><br />Effects of External Conditions<br /><br />Disc 2:<br /><br />Conditions of Existence<br /><br />Variations Under Domestication<br /><br />Parts Developed in an Unusual Manne<br /><br />Entangled Bank<br /><br />Disc 3:<br /><br />Unconscious Selection<br /><br />Endless Forms Most Beautiful<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />Interview with Tatiana and Set Tour from \\"The Nerdist\\"<br /><br />Send in the Clones<br /><br />Insider Vignettes<br /><br />I don't get BBC America in my area, but I saw the series advertise on a recent Doctor Who DVD release and it looked intriguing. BBC Home Entertainment nicely sent me a free copy in exchange for my honest review. I didn't know what to expect from the series, but I was hooked by the end of the first episode. Tatiana Maslany does a wonderful job playing multiple characters, though my favorite is the housewife (aka soccer mom) Alison Hendrix. Despite having a science fiction plot, the series is more of a thriller, similar in style to the X-Files or even Torchwood. The supporting cast is great, especially Matt Fewer as the so-called villain. For me, the episodes were more likes chapters in a good book as it kept getting better and better. The bad news is it ended in a cliffhanger, but the second season will air in the spring of 2014! Overall, I loved watching each intense episode of Orphan Black: Season One and I recommend it to everyone!es, but I was hooked by the end of the first episode.

The bad news is it ended in a cliffhanger, but the second season will air in the spring of 2014! Overall, I loved watching each intense episode of Orphan Black: Season One and I recommend it to everyone!
B003VANOFY|5.0|easy to use and worked fantastically, would definitely recommend to other people to use. Battery lasts for a long time, barely notice at all
0307476073|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's intimate story of her amazing struggle of self-redemption and transformation is a must read. The setting along the PCT, her struggles with heat & cold, fear & loneliness, joy & sorrow weave a tale of grace along the West's most profoundly beautiful upheaval of volcanic rock, mountains, tress and streams. You will likely feel renewed and refreshed and a deeper sense of self acceptance as you walk with Cheryl through her struggle to know herself again and to love that person she is.
B004S5C8WG|5.0|Having read some of the Authors books many years ago I still love  his work.  Throughout the story there is the odd twist and keeps you reading. Loved the final chapter that made me want more.
B00A8FXT8M|5.0|An absolute gem of a novel.  Beautiful writing and in spite of the fact the story could be thought of as ordinary, I found I couldn't turn the pages quickly enough.  A book to be recommended to all who appreciate GOOD literature.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|The instructions are not helpful at all.  I can't figure out how to get the items I am supposed to find to show up so I can look for them.  I have tried but can't find them.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|I'm a long time Satch fan. I was in high school when \\"Surfing\\" came out and have been hooked on Joe's music ever since. I'm a big fan of his more recent albums, particularly Black Swans and Super Colossal. As for his latest work, the more I play the more I like it.<br /><br />What I want to call out in this review is the sound quality on the album. IMO Joe's studio recordings up through Black Swans sound generally unspoiled by loudness-war inspired mastering. But Unstoppable Momentum... Im hearing too much clipped drums, crescendos that don't actually get louder, sonic \\"congestion\\" in the music.<br /><br />I love the music but I'm very disappointed to hear Joe's music recorded this way.
B008MM9630|5.0|I like the fact that you can revive crops for free, its so annoying on other games when your crops wither.<br />The only bad thing about this game, is that you are all alone. Except for pets
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|awesome app also very fun and hard but this is something enjoyable for the wole family love this app must get
0770437400|4.0|I haven't had an opportunity to read the book.  I plan to start on it soon and hope I will enjoy reading it.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|love the app but please I have two nieces and I can't have porn ads keep popping up my screen every 3 mins!!
B0094KF4WG|4.0|I already knew the outcome, but I like to peak into that dark world of CT.<br />Hard to stretch that short time frame into a book.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Dude once I started the game (I did the street map just to let you know) I felt something like following me it was freaking me out! Plus I saw him over a hill and I just kept on goin' ya know. till came the part were I got so scared because I don't like getting scared even though I need a thrill once in a while. plus slenderman I heard from my camp counselor said it isn't that scary so I got this to find out and its fun BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!<br />  Plus slenderman is always watching.................always...........
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|What a fun, quick read...light and informative.  Africa looks so very real and human.  This woman is an exception to the rule in fortitude and whit.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|my whole family is addicted to Castle and can't wait for season 6! The absolute best show on TV! downloaded season 5 while at the beach house..no TV or internet there. worked great on my Kindle Fire!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|As an Illinois resident, I can definitely relate to the Chicago corruption.  The characters are good and while there are ongoing plots, each episode is good on its own and you don't have to watch it for years to have some sort of understanding of the characters.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Seems very plodding. I am only half way through, but whereas with his other two books, I could not lay them down, I have trouble getting back to this. And with the plot so &#34;ungripping,&#34; I am more aware of the actual writing, and I am finding it to be less than brilliant, which had not been an issue for me previously...
B00CEQ1HQE|5.0|When previews for this Lagoona doll first came out, I didn't think I'd like her because of her new look and bright yellow hair, but the doll is lovely.  I love how colorful she is, she really stands out and I think it's a great change for Lagoona.  Her clothes are great and I love her pet fish in its fishbowl.
B009AMAGQM|4.0|First off: I didn't read the book first (didn't know there was one, but I'm reading it now!).<br />I thought this movie was pretty awesome. The plot moves fast and maybe some character development got lost in the mix, but the acting from the cast was great! If you're looking for a supernatural love story, I'd definitely reccommend this! And if (like me) you didn't read the book first, watching this movie will encourage you to read the book and get to know the characters better!
B004TNGLW0|5.0|Let me start by saying if you are not a cigar fan I completely understand that this is a waste of money for you.  If you are, however, a cigar enthusiast and a Scarface fan this is your set! The blu ray is what it is. It's Scarface, a wonderfully crafted and entertaining film starring the amazing Al Pacino. The Humidor is the steal at under $300. A limited edition hand made humidor made by master craftsman Daniel Marshall, this humidor does not disappoint. It is everything you expect out of a Daniel Marshall humidor, beautiful, well-crafted and a top notch storage unit for your sticks. Check out prices for other Daniel Marshall humidors then grab this one while you can. You will not be disappointed.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Be forewarned of annoying pop-up ads before you get this version of solitaire...I have already deleted it from my kindle.
0515125024|5.0|another great read by Lee Child .. I'm near the end of the series .. will have to soon find another author of same caliber.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|love this game, good for whenever you need to kill some time.  Highly recommended for all ages, get this one you won't be sorry!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Martin and I wasn't disappointed.  I enjoyed this book and I can't wait to read the next.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I highly recommend this book both for thrills and facts.  I Always enjoy Rollins while learning interesting and new information.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book but feel both this and volume 2 of this saga could very well have been combined.  This ended reather ubruptly so this series is a definite &#34;must read all&#34; and not in any way free standing.<br />Having said all this, it did hold my interest.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I read the book first and was still surprised in the movie. It followed the book pretty closely also. Loved it!
B00633W614|4.0|Enjoyed both of these tremendously on the heels of the first Clifton Chronicle Saga.<br />However, I do believe 3 volumes was a bit much for the story thus far.  Would have been better to combine into 2 books & not have as much repetition.<br />I will, however, look forward to volume 4 of this saga.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Visually stunning but a little slow in places. Great story of survival with a twist at the end....would recommend it.
B002N21UKM|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who has a close friend, needs a close friend, or has lost a close friend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this game because it includes everything that u would need to care for a horse and its fun
B0010T0OCY|2.0|If you like the sensation of big mosquitoes sucking life out of you, or if you really enjoy wasting time,  watch this movie.
B00DU73T08|1.0|Geesh, is this ever a lame movie. I think Amazon should take it off-line since it is incorrectly advertised as entertainment. It is actually torture worse than water-boarding. If I could get the 30 minutes of my life back that I wasted watching the first part of this movie, it would still need to be burned from my memory. I am NOT over reacting. It is the worst movie made in 2013 bar none.<br /><br />Where do I begin? The constant narration and second voice talking is annoying and the acting is as if they were doing a short film for free. The plot line is explored so clumsily that it has no excitement. The two leads have as much chemistry as Hillary and Bill Clinton. The flash backs come at the wrong times. The \\"aliens\\" are very style conscious and materialistic. You can see the blond chick \\"seeker\\" wearing thong underwear thru her slacks. They drive a pimped out car that would attract attention, yet the other \\"aliens\\" drive 1980's Volvos.<br /><br />If you do one thing this summer, call a friend and warn them of this piece of Donkey dung being sold as a \\"movie\\" or entertainment. Friends don't let friends watch \\"THE HOST\\"!
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|I usually like Denzel Washington and the movies he is in. This one is the exception.  Talk about getting depressed! Talk about wanting the characters to fly far far away! Talk about a movie that somehow allows everyone in it to shine about as much as a clod of dirt from the swamps of New Jersey! I repent, Lord, of wasting my time with this flick!! The best part of the movie was the beginning air flight and the big crash. The remainder of the movie was one long sickening dive into the bowels of human depravity and the pointless pounding portrayal of a man out of control.  John Goodman's role is stupid and sick; the soundtrack is stupid and sick. Can you tell I didn't like this movie?
B00622D3BS|5.0|Funny, touching ... overall enjoyable movie.  You can watch this with family, friends, or a significant other. It is great!
0061950726|5.0|very good book  I wish it hadn't ended looking for a new good book  I will keep looking for a new book
193700788X|1.0|This review has SPOILERS!!! But if you re reading this I'm pretty sure you know what happens.    Okay so as reader I have read a few series were the ending wasn't satisfying or was just predictable.This ending was however an insult. It insulted the readers many of which have been following this series for years. Personally i have been following this series for about 8 years. I loved the first 10 books and i was looking forward to a wonderful ending to the series. That is not what i got. Books 11 and 12 had high points but were whiny and redundant. I wanted there to be a solution to the whole Freyda and Eric marriage thing and for Sookie to grow up and tell Eric she loved him and would help figure it out.    Dead Ever After felt like it wasn't even apart of the series. The writing style was completely different and there was so many contradictions. I felt like i should have reread some of the other books because characters that i don't even remember showed up. There were so many opportunities for cool plot-lines. What about the \\"devil\\", a new supe is introduced and we learn nothing about it. Mr C. who is Sookie's godfather ( i dont know how to spell his name :).. ) says hes going to teach Sookie how to use her telepathy. We never saw that. And the big fight with Eric what the hell!!!! SOOKIE DOESN'T LIKE VAMPIRES ANYMORE WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She pretty much tells Eric that she doesn't want to be a vampire because she thinks there vile and disgusting?! Okay chick out of all the guys who  you've slept with 50 % were vamps! And when did Eric need permission to do anything. He's ERIC!!!!!!!!!!! That's why we love him. Hes calculating ,always has a plan and has obviously been in love with Sookie form the very first book. Now he just gives up. Why didn't he just kill Sam? He couldn't have stopped Sookie from using the Cluvil dor (sp). Which by the way it was stupid to bring Sam back from the dead. I like Sam well enough but what if he had become a zombie or evil. That wouldhave been a cool storyline Sookie has to save her friend by killing him!  okay Granted i can forgive Eric for not doing certain things 1. because Sookie was being stupid and whiny.2. He is my favorite character in the series. 3 . That was not Eric.. not the Eric i love so much. I forgave him for being a defeatist out of love for Eric books 1- 11. The writer OBVIOUSLY HATES ERIC. I heard that Ms Harris hates that Eric is so popular especially because of True blood which by the way pays her i guessing a lot. Not J.K. Rowlings but still. So she decided to write him out the last book. YOU WROTE IT LADY! WE LIKE THE CHARACTER YOU MADE UP. And the setup was for Eric and Sookie to be endgame right? We don't get to see what happens to Eric? Which pissed me off the most. Why couldn't Sookie stage a coup and rescue him... this book proved she has a lot of friends and many being supes.Why didn't Sookie wish to have a fae's lifespan so she could stay with Eric without becoming a vamp.She just gives up??? There were so many ways that Sookie could have been with Eric. or Quinn or Bill or hell actually have a relationship with Alicide.  But Sookie ends up with SAM! of all people? Though the whole series its been established that Sam is a friend. It was a point that was almost stressed to much and those who would say that Sookie stressing that she didn't like Sam that is a hint excuse my french but that is bulls***. The magic changed Sookie and sam my ass. These two never had chemistry.  Sam has always loved sookie but it was one sided he got over her and then this....?????????? WTF. This relationship was sloppy and rushed. Why does Sookie need a man  anyway then. The tone was totally a human southern purist attitude that was actually sexist with placed traditional gender roles when in the beginning the books were all about accepting the weird and abnormal. And a positive LGBT outlook. The end was anticlimactic and when i was finished i was so mad i ranted and raved for over an hour to at least four people. I threw the book at the wall in anger (and i don't abuse my books like that) when Sookie and Sam had sex. and the sex was amazing Sookie REALLY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? nothing happened. What happened to those sexy steamy great sex scenes? It doesn't need to be 50 shades of Grey but come on woman is a spark to much to ask for? There are so many problems with these books its like reading a badly written college midterm paper where the student obviously didn't proofread and didn't give a crap about their grade. There are to many lose ends, bad writing and inconsistencies to even attempt to list them all.    To say I'm highly disappointed in this ending is an understatement. I'm Livid. If Ms Harris is smart she will offer an apology and write the ending we as readers deserve. Until that happens and i assume hell will freeze over and George R. R. Martin doesn't kill about 75 % of his main characters in his next book will happen first, I will pretend the last three books didn't happen and Eric and Sookie live HEA.
B002O2THRO|5.0|I went and saw the new 2013 version of The Great Gatsby a couple weeks ago and wanted to watch the 1974 version again to compare. The 1974 version is still a great movie. Mia Farrow just makes a great Daisy and Robert Redford as Jay Gatsby you can not beat!<br />Thank you Amazon for letting me be able to watch on my blue ray.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|It does as said----It will keep your headset charged for 3 days on one charge--as long as you let it rest therin
B006SV2LWA|3.0|From seeing the previews I expected more! Not a bad movie but I expected more! It wasn't as good as I thought it was!
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Ferris Bueer is loved by everyone except his sister. He skips school convinces he's friend to go along with and helps his girlfriend get out as well, so they can have a crazy day. His principal knows he is skipping and tries to catch him in the act. Funny 80's movie.
B002RKSZS0|3.0|It's a Classic and interesting reading. The story is slow but the pace was slow then. I might read it again someday. I much prefer Pride and Prejudice if you are considering reading just one Classic love story.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the closest game to the great Myst<br /> series. Wonderful graphics and story, really enjoyed it. Eagerly waiting for the next installment.
B0000AFX64|4.0|I nice show, enjoyed the wide-screen. However, I thought I was getting the long version which I believes runs close to 3 hours. Viewer will get most of this content in the series, episodes 1-3.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very erotic and a great love story.  Couldn't put it down.  Read it 3 times.  I have never reread a book once, but these I had too.
B00CBSYDSE|5.0|I saw these guys live in Brooklyn and they didn't disappoint. Scale the Summit is definitely at the apex of musicianship, definitely check it out!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I liked finally reading the story about Harry's solving the serial murder case that is referred to in nesbo s other books.  I had trouble keeping the characters straight in the first half the book.  I didn't know enough about each one until later.  All in all this like nesbo s other books are consuming.  I can't put them down.  The character Harry becomes someone you know well and love in spite of his shortcomings.  I guess maybe we recognize the Harry in ourselves.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Tom Cruise is just a good actor, and it was an interesting story. Being retired military, I enjoyed the technical details of the Soldier's art they brought in, but the story is a modern detective yarn.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|If you do you will be disappointed.  I followed all the steps, put in the promotional code and the pushed complete sale.  It spun until the time set by Fandango ran out the sent me to the beginning.  Went completely through again and the same thing happened.  It would not finish the sale.  I had to leave for the movie so I couldn't do it a third time.  You can't buy the ticket until you are sure which theater and which show time you want.  Waist of time but the DVD was good just lost the $7.50 on a free ticket for Despicable Me2, which was also great, even better than the first.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|This movie is a lot of fun. The adventure is fun and the characters interact silly together. The action is exciting.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|This was a film that everyone who has felt love could relate to. The actions scenes where great. Why did they get a new Victoria though?
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This game is asinine. It has the animals in ridiculous scenarios and all inside a pet store? terrible. We should not be encouraging kids to BUY animals or glorify the despicable business in any way. Plus the game itself is not fun.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Thor is a clean, lighthearted, fun movie with good action. Nice way to escape for a few hours.  Good for kids or adults.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Me and my 2 year old love this it is so fun, he enjoys the responsibility I am very satisfied
3453268725|1.0|Buyer beware.  This book is in GERMAN.  I found nothing in the listing for this book indicating that it is in German.  Suffice to say that I was very surprised upon receiving this book that it is not in English.  I contacted the seller regarding returning the book.  They responded that \\"you are welcome to return the title\\", but \\"we are unable to reimburse customers for expenses incurred returning titles to us\\".  I live in California and it would cost approximately $18 postage to return this book to the United Kingdom.  I only paid $33 for the book, so it seems I'm stuck with it.  How can they only charge $3.99 shipping?  Confused and disappointed in California.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Great puzzles to do and lots of fun. Different levels of puzzles to do. Like the animals the best. Thanks.
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|I have been a Superman fan since 1953. Everyone has the right to produce their own interpretation. I have read a lot of bad reviews and was expecting the worst. It was entertaining for sure. The effects are the best possible. The film drags at times but mostly action. My thoughts are the S on the back of the cape is gone and it gives Superman a Roman Gladiator look. I can deal with the red shorts gone, but you need the S on the cape. The biggest negative on this film is the music, or lack of. Superman is synonymous with a strong music score. In this respect, it is a flop as the music is neither memorable or impressionable. This is a huge negative on the film and was the culprit in the lack of excitement. Zack, listen up from someone who knows. Trust me.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This thing is great! It's compact size makes it a plus for storing in my backpack. I'll never go camping without it. I might order a 2nd one for my Bug Out Bag.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|so far ive had a lot of fun playing this game. I also payed for it and it's worth it.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This season had some definite surprises and **spoiler*** killed off a couple of the main characters, but looking forward to next season.
B000HZHBIM|2.0|It tries. You must remember this was filmed in the late 70's. The feel is classic star trek, with the Spock logic playing the counter to Kirk's emotion. As with the series it all turns out to be a misunderstanding, that could have gone horribly wrong if another path were taken.
159463176X|5.0|Bought this book for my daughter who is a fan of this author and he does not disappoint. Would like to see this book made into a movie.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I began reading this book for entertainment. The more I read, the more I could relate. Having been through some tough life experiences within the last few years, this book has shone some light into this\\"dark room\\" called my mind. I will be recommending this to my family and friends!
B00915G6WQ|3.0|Dexter has generated so much good will during its first five seasons, that it's easy to overlook the shortcomings of last season as well as this most recent one since we're so invested in how things are going to end for everyone's favorite serial killer.  And let's face it, season 7 has a lion's share of flaws to forgive.  The writing is inconsistent and lazy at times, there are too many uninvolving plot lines, way too much padding in terms of the story lines of the supporting players and the whole season feels like it is about twice as long as it needs to be.  Thankfully Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter continue to give excellent performances in this penultimate season.<br /><br />The action picks up following the bombshell that ended season 6.  Debra witnessed Dexter murdering one of his victims thus opening up a fascinating new venues for the series to explore.  Unfortunately, not enough time is devoted to the quandry of how Dexter and Debra can reconcile the dark passenger with their complicated relationship.  The best moments of season 7 focus on Debra's conflict over her response to Dexter's secret and the residual effects it has on her physically and emotionally.  The rest of the time the show spins its wheels with underwhelming storylines such as the romance between Dexter and a fellow murderer, Quinn's involvement with a stripper, Bautista's retirement, and a serial killer who hunts down his victims in homemade mazes.  One saving grace is the dynamic that is explored between Dexter and a Ukranian mob boss who start out as enemies but come to respect and understand one another.<br /><br />Thankfully, the season ends with a bang and puts things in motion for the eight and final season which will ultimately reveal Dexter's fate.  Will his humanity win out over his dark passenger?  Can he ever be forgiven for his actions?  Should he be?  Will he lose everything that he holds dear?  These are the fascinating questions that I'm look forward to mulling over and they are what make the show worth sticking with until the end.and they are what make the show worth sticking with until the end.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I love this movie, got it through amazon as preorder and all.. Ir would be interesting to see this green lighted now hat Lone Ranger flopped...please Disney make a sequel...
B00CW665VI|5.0|First of all, I would like to say that out of all the books I have purchased for my kindle, this is my First review. I soooo enjoyed this book so much!!! There were parts in this book where I was laughing so hard that tears formed in my eyes, I ended up re-reading them several times over. I totally agree with someone saying that this book HAD to be written by a man (I think Emma Chase is the real authors Kate LOL)...But anyway, I think it was very well written...outstanding job!!! I could not put this book down! So if you are looking for a refreshing, funny, well thought out story about a man coming to grips with.... well becoming a man in a relationship...Please pick up this book. It will not disappoint you!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|If you would like to save your pictures, don't waste your money---you can edit them till you're blue in the face but recently they completely stopped saving or sharing properly.  I just noticed a few weeks ago but have no idea how long it's been going on (I didn't use the app for a few months).  Customer support won't respond to inquiries, either.  The lite version saves..but unfortunately doesn't allow photo overlay, which is why I purchased this app instead of using the lite version anyway.  Now I'm stuck trying to find another app that does this and allows me to share.  Just a friendly warning, if you're paying for it....don't.  Galaxy S4
0345803485|3.0|This book was ok-I would suggest the Bertrice Small \\"Skye O'Malley\\" series-which I read years ago and gave this book a run for it's money. 50 shades of BORING!
B0054SMID0|4.0|The movie was pretty much in line with the book, so the story line was good. The characters were believable; the movie was entertaining. What more could a movie fan want?!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|This movie is better if you have not read any of his books first. TomCruise as Jack Reacher what a stretch!!  He played the part OK, but what us Jack fans love about Jack was not present, in looks (Jack is 6' 5&#34;) or in brute strength.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the series, I thought &#34;Entwined&#34; was going to be more about Gideon and his life but it took a direction following up with the death of Eva's rapist and segregated Eva and Gideon, which I wasn't prepared for.  The book didn't get into Gideon's life much, other than support his ongoing love for Eva and needing her.  I loved the book and can't get them fast enough but I was somewhat surprised by the direction it took.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|This book, told mostly in letters, was a charming read.  I was almost sad when it ended, particularly as I know the author will never produce another book.<br /><br />I do have a criticism; the author's niece was charged with finishing the novel. While I loved this book there are areas where the characterizations fail and the style changed, particularly near the end.  I suspect this was due to a new voice.  I still loved the book and would reccommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this new solitaire. The numbers are large, it has a redo button, love the winning picture, does all it said.
1433502410|1.0|I've read some of the one star comments prior to purchasing the bible but decided to buy it anyway. I read a new translation of the bible every year and this year I picked ESV because of the rave reviews, well I just have to speak out. The translation in itself is decent, I mean granted as one reviewer pointed out there are 17 verses completely removed from this bible, but that's the case with pretty much all translations (except NKJV and KJV), but if I was to review the the translation I'd give oh at best 4/5 stars. But what really ticked me off was the commentary. The people that wrote them, well let me just say I have no idea what kind of scholars they are but I'd never let them close to myself or my kids with such erroneous comments. Right from the get go in the introduction to Genesis it talks about Genesis and science and the authors made it so convoluted, I can totally see the hidden agenda, I don't know about others but I got the feeling that the authors aren't exactly on the side of a literal six day creation. The commentary is off - and let me remind everyone its a slow fade, you might think oh its no big deal but a word changed here and a verse taken out there, or a commentary that is not always 100% correct but seriously whether you realize it or not you are letting someone else shape your belief system - and its not God, its the authors of a commentary<br /><br />I do recommend this translation to people, but I don't recommend this study bible. Just get a regular bible, no study commentary and read for yourself, pray, and find out through a relationship with God and your church what those passages really mean - studying prophecy for many years I can tell you that this bible commentary does not teach the truth and despite the fact it says that \\"scholars are almost unanimous in recognizing the little horn [in Daniel 8:9-10] is Antiochus IV Epiphanes\\" it just doesn't make sense in biblical prophecy... I won't go further then that into it but none of our reformation church fathers, Wesley, Luther, etc. believed it to be Antiochus IV either, look it up yourself. It's these erroneous statements that are all over the place and I bid the reader be cautious with this study bible if you buy it.
B00AB7IA1S|5.0|Even though the rating didn't make it look like a spectacular game, this is actually a really nice game.<br /><br />It's one of that rare games without in app purchages. The puzzles start out fairly easy, but they quickly get harder. I liked the addition of the special fans, they kept the puzzles challenging through the game.<br /><br />Nice cute graphics too, although they could use some more variation. Since I was too focused on the actual puzzling, it didn't bother me much though.
0394873742|5.0|I didn't realize this was going to literately be the BIGGEST book in the world.  HA!  I love it but it is very big.  My daughter has fun laying on the ground and looking at all the pictures and words.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. A brief glimpse back in the past makes you appreciate the present. Fascinating details were icing on the cake.

B000005RG7|5.0|I would have to say this is one of Uriah Heep's best. I have been a life long fan of theirs since I was little. I am in my Mid-40's now. And this band has had 4 different lead singers in their career. The first was David Byron. I have to chuckle to myself because I thought of his vocal style. If you ever heard of Adam Sandler doing his little bit on SNL called Operaman, you'll know what I'm talking about. I heard one time that the group Queen followed the same style of Uriah Heep especially in the one song \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". It makes me think of a good example of this in the song on their first album called \\"Bird of Prey\\". If you haven't heard this, check it out. Then in the late '70's, John Lawton came into the band for a few albums and his style was a little different than David's. I would say he had a more powerfull voice and less of a tinny and thin voice like David's. Then the singer on this album was Peter Goalby. His style was different in a more modern approach than in the '70's. And the guitar solos from Mick Box were becoming more complex too. And it was refreshing to listen to. Because in the '70's his solos were quite simple but effective. And the last singer in the band was Bernie Shaw. His style was like David's but slightly different. So, if you get a chance, check this album out. Plus, all of the other Heep albums, you'll enjoy them.

B0061S073A|5.0|I've used this app on my android phone, Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy Tablet for over a year - AND LOVE IT!  My kids can't make purchases (even in-app ones)....heck, they can't even exit Kids Place without a PIN.  Just select the app (games) you want to put in Kids Place.....and ta-dah!  The kids can move from game to game within Kids Place, but can't go anywhere else!!!!  It's AWESOME!  Now I don't have to worry about or monitor their play time on any device.  This is BY  FAR the most used app we have in our house......well, worth ($0.00) the peace of mind.  Can't go wrong!
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|It's Kate Beckinsale in Underworld - need anyone say more!!  Arrived when it said it would and couldn't wait to watch it!  A must have.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It is amazing! I think it is just so fun. It feels like I really have a horse.
B009MO57H6|5.0|If you've seen any of these movies you need to see this one and add it to your collection.  As soon as it arrived I watched it!
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I bought this book on Amazon.com for our Kindle. While it took me a full year to read/listen to the first book of this trilogy, it took me less than a week to read the second in the trilogy. Mr Sanderson continues to expand his vivid characters. Those same characters that I grew to know and love in the first book continue to evolve in a believable manner and new characters grow and join the ranks of those we care about. As in the first book, the action is fast paced. Action scenes are exciting, battles show strategy, nerves, and excitement. While this builds off the first in the series, it can easily stand alone, however I hunger to find out how xx and crew will solve the difficulties unleashed by the Well of Ascension. I cannot wait to read the third book of this trilogy, I long for the conclusion.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I'm an old fashioned CD girl and I love this Lady A one!  Every song is awesome!  Probably the best one yet!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  The copy that I ordered through Amazon.com is perfect and there have been no viewing issues.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not usually a fiction reader, but Wool consistently kept my interest.  Howey did a great job creating interesting characters, great plot twists, and a fascinating post apocalyptic world.
6305161992|4.0|The late 80's and early 90's couldn't make enough of 2 types of movies Action & Buddy Comedys.  \\"Showdown in Little Tokyo\\" bangs both these together for this film. What isn't mentioned in most reviews is the talent of Brandon Lee shows his expanding range in both a Martial Arts and acting. While Big Bad Dolph Lundgren is the star, Brandon is certainly a close 2nd.  It's sad to think of what might have been with Brandon (see \\"The Crow\\")  So if you like action Dolph & Brandon dial it up in \\"Showdown in Little Tokyo\\"<br /><br />Please sure to check out  Perfect Weapon, Street Knight, Cyborg, Under Siege, Hard to Kill  Double Impact
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Way more insight into the story than the HBO series.  Surprisingly much more easy to keep characters straight than the series.  Great read!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|It doesn't sync automatically. I have to do an number of things including uninstalling then reinstalling the app. It is beyond annoying.
B0041D843M|4.0|The information in China Study is something every person should be privy to.  Dr. Campbell did a fantastic job laying out his findings on how the Western diet negatively impacts health.  With that said, Dr. Campbell is a bit wordy and repetitive.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Using this on a Dell Ultrabook -- speeds are fantastic.  They truly make great use of the USB 3.0 interface, I am getting speeds in the 110MB/sec (bytes, not bits) range.  Driver installation was a piece of cake.  Using this on Ubuntu 12.04, go to the Anker website to download the driver package.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Let's speak plainly here.  Somewhere on the way past middle age, my mind quit having the \\"snap\\" of earlier decades.  Partly in response to that, and partly because I just love to play, I keep trying new games on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" tablet.  Puzzles, find the object games, crosswords, jumbles, a half-dozen different MahJong games...and all of them are fun.<br /><br />This one is, however, infectiously different.  It involves finding keys, or cards, or numbers to unlock the elevator to the next level.  Clever.  And the path one follows to finding those keys is often devious, fairly challenging, and sometimes just outright funny.  In every level, you are tested.  No, it's not the game to challenge members of the Triple 9 society, but the average reasonably bright person, including a good many Mensa members, will have a blast with it.  I'm fairly slow to recognize some of the obvious clues, and my color blindness is a hump to overcome--but I have fun every time I play this game.  Get it!<br /><br />Frank Howard, author of \\"Screamin' Lisa's and Other Tales,\\" exclusively at Amazon.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Man of Steel portrays a young Superman who is forced to confront his secret extraterrestrial heritage when Earth is invaded by members of his race.<br /><br />After seeing the previous attempt at remaking Superman (which failed miserably), I was hopeful at the new reboot that brought more of a Dark Knight style of movie to the Man of Steel. I was not disappointed, this new remake blew me away with its visual effects (including the 3D), a great story, great action and an awesome villain. Henry Cavill played a great superman who is trying to find his way. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner both played their roles as Superman's fathers very well with Crowe playing a huge role throughout the movie. Costner brought an almost Field of Dreams like quality to his role. Michael Shannon played one of the best villians I have seen onscreen in a while. His scowl throughout the movie made me believe he would do what it takes at completing his mission no matter who or what stood in his way.<br /><br />Although some of the original elements of the Superman story were changed (no surprise as most movies seem to do that), I wasn't bothered by most except the dramatic ending, which I wont give away here, but seemed to be out of character for Superman.<br /><br />They finally did the Superman story right for the most part and I look forward to this on Blu Ray and look forward to the sequels.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This app is so awesome!! It's very, very easy to use. I have had this app for about 2 minutes, and I already know how cool it is. If you want a good editing app, you're definitely not wasting your money with getting this helpful one :D
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I wanted to see the 2nd movie so decided to watch the first one. Very entertaining! Loved the little guys and the animation was wonderful.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use the alarms all the time.  Not just to wake up each morning, but also as reminders about specific tasks. My 4 year old hears it and knows what's coming up because of the ringtone. So many tones to choose from. I also love all the different settings available, I hate a loud alarm, so the setting for raising the volume as it goes off is fabulous. It repeats as you set it, it's easy to turn off for vacation, but you can save it and turn it back on when you get home. You can even change the color for the display, much nicer waking up to a favorite color and a less annoying alarm...especially for this night owl. THANKS!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the series since the beginning--even my 11 year old daughter will watch along with my husband and me:-) the characters have depth and redeeming qualities can be subtly found with so many which allows for great story lines.<br />A definite \\"must-see\\"!
B005V20JKI|3.0|I love this game but I cannot even play the Castle level even though I have unlocked it. In addition, I can't even advance past level 20. I'm told I reached the Max level regardless of having the correct experience points. Love this game...but not so much anymore.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I normally don't like Matthew as an actor.  There are only a couple of movies that he has been in that I really sat all the way through, but this one was really good :)
B00D739JE0|5.0|I listened to this album 4 or 5 times already since getting it and I love it. Sure it's not the most thrashy Megadeth album and is no Rust in Peace 2, but who cares? The songs are still catchy to me and the music is not bad at all.
B00DGN51O8|2.0|This movie was weak, I was not impressed by the characters. Once you got past jack and the princess the other characters had no character except for maybe the one soldier who supported the princess.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this game at first. But boy did it prove me wrong! This<br />game was awesome
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|More worried about special affects then storyline.  Characters had limited personality lets go back to the original version it works better.
1400067820|3.0|This author is a joy in his element--finance--but frequently not so much elsewhere.  For instance, he apparently imagines that \\"work hardening\\" (his terminology is carefully restricted to \\"antifragile\\" variants of course) is a brilliant, newly discovered property of carbon composites, as opposed to the common and millennia-old metallurgical (and more recently polymer science) physical property.  References to the \\"exchange of matter and energy\\" grate the senses.  Name-dropping and verbose exhibitions of dramatic experiences abound.  In the words of a good friend, the guy is a \\"blowhard.\\"  Picture a medicine show doctor who throws his chest out and follows it across the stage.<br /><br />He has some valid observations of course (I especially agree with most of his economic perceptions), but he is obsessed with this whole Black Swan Antifragile idea to the point that he raves like a numerologist--\\"It's everywhere, EVERYWHERE!!\\"  Yes, in some perspectives, this analysis is insightful, but he didn't discover the wheel or invent fire.  He is blinded by the prism of his own construction.  And his construct is a seemingly endless collage of anecdotes and rambling commentary crafted to drive the dedicated reader to the OED--highly recommended for language enthusiasts, just for his obtuse vocabulary.<br /><br />If you can rise above his tedious self-absorption, and his annoying self-referential labeling of concepts (note-taking is recommended,) you may be entertained by his banter.  To describe his style in colloquial terms (apologies for the temporal media fluff) I expected the last page to read \\"Stay thirsty my friends.\\"<br /><br />He has a few additional obsessions, including admiration for criminals (apparently to demonstrate his shockingly original thought), and tellingly, autodidactism (self-education.)  On one hand, this is great for book sales, as there are lots of autodidacts out there (I confess to being one) who may feel underappreciated.  But to be an effective autodidact, one must recognize his limitations; humble this guy ain't.  Only well into the book did I connect his admiration of autodidactism and his occasional smug pronouncements of ideas that are fundamentally wrong, or misconstrued, or misapplied, etc.  It seems he doesn't know that he doesn't know what he doesn't know, unless he purposely throws kinks in to amuse readers with a sense of superior knowledge (possible but doubtful.)<br /><br />Of his central theses, my only significant objection is to his market crash focus, similar to the \\"Chinese dead fish\\" aphorism--a smelly dead fish is valuable not because you would ever want to eat it, but because you can sell it to make money.  The 2008 housing market crash was primarily caused by Congress' \\"Community Reinvestment Act\\" that required banks to give loans to unqualified borrowers in the \\"protected classes\\" (i.e., women and minorities.)  Because he is so grounded in the financials markets, he sees the crash as being caused by the marketing of the defective mortgages--deceptive banking practices caused the crash.  But in fact, that was not the cause, only the result.  Truthful marketing would have prevented the loan bundles from being sold, and the fish would have fallen apart in the hands of the original banks (underwriters,) instead of the subsequent investors--no difference!  Acts of Congress, not the banks or banking regulators, caused the crash.  Banks and regulators only placed it in time and position.<br /><br />Economics is his home field, politics not so much.  This might also leak into his foreign policy comments; I would have to look closely at the historical record before I would accept the assertion that meddling in the third world increases its volatility.  As Ann Coulter said, Mozambique is the norm, and Western society is the exception; stirring gunpowder doesn't necessarily make it more or less volatile.<br /><br />When one is highly trained and experienced in a given arena, as he is in finance,there is very little that impresses him as being new under the Sun.  In fact, it can seem that the whole thing is run by a bunch of dufuses and it should have crashed long ago.  But when you walk by another department, like the Physics Department--why, those guys are dazzling!  They must be geniuses!  This is one of the many curses of the autodidact, and apparently one of his.  Where we are actually trained, we have a much more realistic perspective than we do when peeking in at the other subjects.  I will grant that he is an interesting, if not Renaissance, thinker, but he's still a blowhard.  I had to put the book down for a week to regain control of my blood pressure; read at your own risk.  That said, I learned more than I expected or perhaps realized; he is thought-provoking if nothing else.
0345803485|1.0|I cannot believe that any woman would write books that glorify and promote violence against women. These books have led to other awful practices like Christian domestic discipline. Please women don't read these dangerous books that suggest that women want to be violently abused. If you desire abuse, get therapy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game, it was challenging with out being overly so. Can't wait for more rooms, this game is addicting.
B000LZZOIC|1.0|Was told it was the banned cover and we got the other one I could buy down the street!!! Then I would have to pay to send it back to get a refund after waiting weeks for it  to get here terrible service and waste of money
B000ICXQOM|5.0|I rented this to show my gf..... it's one of the greatest movies EVER for people with a sense of humor and imigination. Bruce Campbell is just plain awesome and the story has everything - romance; action; comedy. Get it now!!
0345803493|4.0|This book is a very interesting and entertaining continuation of Fifty Shades of Grey.  There is more emphasis on the evolving relationship between Ana and Christian with many surprising turn of events.  I found this second part of the trilogy actually more fun to read than the first book.  I would recommend it for mature readers.  The content is definitely adults only.
B0009H1CKG|5.0|Not enough room here to describe all the cool features of this CD.  As much fun to watch as it is listening.<br /><br />George and his gang at their funky best.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great game. Numerous different lay outs and levels. For an added bonus try and clear the levels in under 7 minutes; earning extra stars the quicker you clear the levels. The only negative about this game for me is making myself stop playing it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is special then the subway surf, it is very funny and you should GET IT!!!!!!!!!!! By I mean get it get right now!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000JCEUE6|4.0|Not exactly what I expected but it turned out to be even better!  I thought it was just one vinyl but having 5 pieces made me think of a cool way to display them for my boyfriend and I one year!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was too cute of a movie. Definitely Universal's best (even beating Harry Potter!). I recently alsso saw the 2nd one- also adorably hysterical!

B00CHI5B7A|5.0|I RATED FIVE STARS BECAUSE I BELIEVED THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING. ALL THE ACTORS WERE PERFECT FOR THEIR PARTS. JOSH BROLIN LOOKS LIKE HE REALLY BELONGS IN THAT TIME.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Best book ever is all I can say I mean absolutely speechless so heart warming and depressing can not put the book down once you start!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is like a toned down version of Downton Abby but more about the &#34;commoners&#34; of the day. It reminds of a British &#34;Little House on the Prairie&#34; very entertaining! I recommend for good old family fun TV night--wait do families still do that--if not they should & this is the perfect place to start!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG this is the best running app ever I like it better then temple run one and two so I think you should all get this app
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This is a visually beautiful film that is well acted by a stellar cast.<br /><br />It's an interesting premise - a home for retired musicians has a surprising new resident.<br /><br />As with all places where there is more than a small group, there is the usual infighting and intrigue. However, humorous moments abound, making this a surprisingly nice movie.<br /><br />Maggie Smith gives a stellar performance!<br /><br />Don't miss this one!
0062068423|3.0|A little slow. Will not read any other books by this author. Thought I'd learn more about Norway and its society.
6305212112|5.0|All four of these actresses do a superb job. The film is a visual delight with many wonderful scenes and vignettes.<br /><br />Don't miss this one!  A classic!<br /><br />The Secret's in the Sauce!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Always keeps me on the edge of my seat. My whole family is hooked. Never was interested in watching until I gave it a try after my friends told me how good it is. Love it!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love, love Downton Abbey.  I've purchased all three seasons.  And cannot wait for Season four! I will probably buy the fourth season too.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very well written, I cared about the characters and wanted to put it down but could not. The ending was little rushed but still good.
032147404X|3.0|Not sure how else to present material such as this so I guess it is OK.  Each section gives information on how to take the best picture and what settings to use to capture them with the camera.  Since I don't use the camera every day I will have to come up with some kind of cross reference to make finding the proper setting for the scene or picture I want to take easier to find.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great this all is like subway surfers but more fun then that. It's pretty addicting if you ask me I at it alot
B007RKPO84|4.0|This album is a bit complex. It may not go over that well on the first listen but the more you listen the more you come to realize that these guys aren't playing around. They have a vision and they have the ability to take the listener into some pretty strange and wonder filled landscapes on this one. The songs and complex melodies will come to stick with you after a few listens and I am almost tempted to call this one of the most progressive thrash albums I've ever heard. There are heavy elements of Slayer on here but it goes way above and beyond into a level of musical academia than even those other (more popular name brand ) bands have been able to achieve. I'm sure this is one of those albums that will be looked back on someday perhaps in the far away future as a true Thrash classic. It is a true artistic endeavor.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|i I downloaded this when I saw it as the free app of the day but immediately deleted when I started reading all the reviews saying it collected personal information and required an internet connection to play.  What kind of game is this?
B00992CF6W|5.0|Kids find it fun and interesting. They play together in joined world's between two kindles. Awesome for a road trip and peace in the car.  Can build and create objects as well as  &quot;mine&quot;  for items and resources.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show has become one of my all time favorites.  It is well written.  The acting is fantastic.  There is great drama every week.  its funny and witty.  Really what's not to love??  Seriously, stop reading and start watching.  You will be hooked.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this for a one day deal when it was just $19.99!! I couldn't give up the offer, and with prime shipping it came the next morning, so that was awesome. The box itself is very well made and the booklet  inside has very thick &#34;Pages&#34; I guess you could call them. Overall this is great whether or not you've seen the films yet.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Great game great graphics fun story line, but for all you parents i would say the story line could be sketchy i would say just let them pay on live
B0063IH60K|4.0|I think this game is entertaining and makes you think.  I also like it more than setting up my own game.  It takes less time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game because it really makes me use my mind.  The game is very clever in making someone think about the process.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Chose these to replace some Nike Sport Motion headphones that Nike (actually Phillips is the manufacturer) doesn't make any more. Had them for 2 months and still work fine. I expect for the price one of the ear pieces to short out after about 6 months or so since I work out with them on and sweat all over them. That is what happened with the Nike ones anyways. Very light and are the style I like.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Avery good book by John and presented through the Amazon Kindle is a very good way to be able to read any book available at all times
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is a great app. I've never spent money on an entertainment app before, but I liked the trial version of this so much that I decided to buy it. I never played MtG before this and I think it is a great low cost, minimal effort, no pressure way to learn how to play.<br />There are a few downsides but they don't really interfere with enjoying the app. I use the app on my Galaxy S4 which is only about a month old. Using the app for a long time makes my phone heat up a lot and seems to drain the battery much faster than other apps that also have the screen constantly on. My guess is that this app is much more computationally demanding than most so there isn't anything to be done about that. Also, the S4 has a fairly large screen as far as phones go, and making selections on the screen can sometimes be a challenge. Having more control over view options would mitigate a lot of this but the inconvenience doesn't ruin the experience.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series continues to be fascinating.  The series is great and watching it through the Amazon Prime instant video is really easy and enjoyable.  The show comes through very well with none of those annoying freezes while the streaming catches up.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I love to hear these songs again without a commercial interruption like on the radio. The<br />best tim e in rock and roll since the 50's.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so fun and awesome a wonderful game for children to play! My dad even loves the game! It is so cute!
B00CTKHXFO|2.0|rephrase my words, anyone who target the art-book within this deal should not buy this version, not worth the money.<br /><br />------<br /><br />1. Art book is a crap.  No layout and no thought to lavage the art book, it just one image per page layout booklet.  It doesn't contain much valuable graphic art from the series.<br />2. Code doesn't work<br />3. Game disk is directly from HD version<br /><br />Get HD version to save you that $20 bucks.  Or wait a while as this game likely to go on sale very soon with such dis-value marketing manner.
B005BDZN62|2.0|This was an anwer on Jeopardy one evening and I wondered what 'West Side Story' was so I purchased it and 15 minutes of viewing was to much, I donated it .
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I enjoy reading all of David Baldacci's books and look forward to reading the new ones. Although I read &#34;The Smithsonian&#34;, I decided to read the first book to learn more about the characters as well as why King and Maxwell left the Secret Service. I recommend reading this book if you are a fan of the King and Maxwell TV show on TNT. It will give you an excellent background to understand some of the plot lines and some of the characters in the TV show. In addition, it is an exciting read with an excellent and surprising ending.
6305531412|5.0|The introduction of annimation blended with true life has opened a door to even more classics since this one was produced, thank you!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|As with his previous books, Dan Brown provides information and education on topics that most of us have no real knowledge.  While I assume there is some literary license at times, his books are enjoyable and compelling reads.
B005VGMYZM|5.0|This DVD has numberous presentations at different places on various occasions and the sceens are truly beautiful. To gaze upon people from different parts of our world proves that we all are the same and music is our lifetine!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|He does have a way of stating things simply and getting straight to the point. Highly recommended!<br /><br />I'm definitely going to see what else Mr. Murphy has to offer.
B007N0REX6|5.0|The item was good and in excellents codition. Love the cd and I recomend it to everyone. Slash and Myles Kennedy are great
B005GQ5IA0|5.0|in no way comparable to the movie with Will Smith. This story is far more realistic and therefore darker, better. Despite the fact that it was written in the fifties, it explains many dogmata of the vampire genre in a very plausible way. Never knew a good explanation why vampire fear the cross or garlic, now I know. More than that, Matheson explains also the origin of vampirism and it sounds real.<br />After watching the movie I couldn't explain to myself, why it was called \\"I am legend \\", after reading the book, I know the reason. And it makes sense.<br />It's a fast paced read you almost can't put down. It seems to short, I'd loved to read more about Robert Neville and his life in his post apocalyptic world. A very surprising end, nothing like Hollywood would had ever written.
B009R659L8|5.0|Twists and turns abound in this quirky story about antiques and family.  As usual, another page turner from Mary Higgins Clark!
B00BG08FKK|3.0|I really struggled with whether to give a 3 or 4 rating. I decided to give it a 3, because my review is not abt the quality of the music, etc, etc., but rather the editing choices. Obviously, I wouldn't have bought the CD if I didn't love the soundtrack in the first place. And it's awesome. (Although I must admit that I have tired of Anne Hathaway's \\"I Had a Dream\\" due to its overplay.)<br /><br />Several reviewers have noted the incompleteness of the recording and I completely concur. The eliminated sung dialogue was highly disappointing, as I had looked forward to it -- in particular the opening of \\"Fantine's Arrest\\" between Javert & Fantine and the Valjean segue into \\"The Bargain.\\" (The truncated version of \\"Look Down\\" goes without saying. When I listened to the music for the first time, I was surprised beyond measure and cannot fathom why the song was edited.)<br /><br />If the eliminations were a matter of time limitations, I can understand this. What I can't understand, however, is the inclusion of fighting sounds and the thunks and grunts of the barricade boys & Javert as they took each other on. These sound effects add nothing to the recording but instead detract from it. I want to hear music, not sound effects. Likewise is spoken dialogue. I know the story. I'm just interested in the songs.<br /><br />Without these disappointments, the complete soundtrack would be a solid 5 stars. After all, I saw the movie 7 times.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|It has really improved my searching for various items having the app handy on both my phone and kindle fire.  I have used it many times since installing without any failures.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I'm a fan of books that build characters and tie things together.  WWZ had none of this, a lot of different stories.  It was ok.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great ending to a great series. Loved the books can't wait for the rest of the movies.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|so many words in so many languages have been written to share ones own truth about this novel. and there seems to be a lot of truth within those words.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|For a small child this is a fun and entertaining game. I even have fun playing it. If you aren't one for childish games then I don't recommend this game to you, but other then that it's a great game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best rush game! There are costumes to buy and the &quot;missions&quot; you need to complete to get a higher multiplier are not too difficult...yet. Very fun, entertaining, and addicting!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|IN the end, the kindlefire was replaced, because nothing worked...it would not charge ... and I have not used this on the new kindle.. so good of you to send it however...

B00632HWOG|4.0|I used this product for a while now and really like controls. Even though there are products that integrate different emails into one, I prefer to use Yahoo mail separetly.

B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Best game ever but really ment for older kid so don't let the little kids play it what till there ten or something. :)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thought this book gave u alot of answers you have been waiting for.  I absolutely loved it, I was a little disappointed when it ended as I thought this was the last book in the series, now I am just waiting for the next one.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|How many of us have crossed paths with the rich and famous? I can honestly say I have been fortunate enough to cross paths with several rich and very famous people. I can also honestly say I have God to thank for granting me my wishes and blessing me so many ways.<br />In this short story -Terry Sparkes is quite the actor. I also think the author, Duncan Whitehead is quite a talented writer in that he was witty enough to mention his other novel \\"The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club\\" in this one. In an \\"Actor's Life - A Short Story\\" the main character is an amateur, but he is smart enough to follow a successful actor in Hollywood. Not only is Sir Michael Brooks a renown actor - he is also the richest. Little does Terry know his life is about to change forever.<br />Riches and Fame! How many of us wish for this, but so often never reach our goal - maybe it's because we quit trying and just give up on our dreams. I believe it is the irony to a lot of people in a lot of situations. But that doesn't mean we cannot be happy with what we achieve in our lifetime.<br />I hope this author wins an Oscar for his performance. He has my vote and so does this short story that is witty and very well crafted.<br /><br />Jeannie Walker - Award Winning Author - \\"Fighting the Devil\\" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played cause love horse and they are my favorite animal awesome. game

1781162646|5.0|Not what I was used to by the KING however I was hanging on every work and LOVED IT!!! Anything by the King is worth reading at  least twice!!
B002IKLZZY|5.0|A fantastic film, IMO it is Hitchcock's best. Cary Grant is soo sauve, and Eva Marie Saint has never been sexier. James Mason is pure evil as \\"Vandam\\", the master spy. Martin Landau is very creepy as \\"Leanard\\", Vandama' assistant. 5 Stars
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|So disapointin. Honestly I didn't know what I was expecting. I thought I should give it a chance since I read the first two. The fact that it picked up right where it left off had me thinking it was going to let me know more about what Gideon did for his woman. But instead they went through  the same jealous insecure problems and then abruptly end the story for a part four that I'm definately not going to read. At this point I don't care what happens to them.
B00871C09S|5.0|IMO Aflred Hitchock was at his creative height during the 1950's and \\"Rear Window\\" is one of his best from that era. Jimmy Stewart is a professional photograper who is wheel chain ridden due to an accident while working at his profession, he lives in an apartment complex in which he can view the other tenants during an extremely hot New York city summer as all the tenants leaves the drapes/blinds open. Raymond Burr, as a tenant who lives directly accross from Stewarts apartment, has an ailing bedridden wife who suddenly goes away on a trip. Well Stewart has an idea that Burrs' wife has not gone on vacation and that she was murdered. Stewart girldfriend is played by Grace Kelly who is also at the height of her girly charms and is always enegantly dressed, he plays a high society fashion model in the film. I sure love 1950's womans fashion. Thelma Ritter plays Stewarts wise cracking nurse and Wendell Corey is a police detective friend of Stewart who is skeptical of his friends fears. 5 Stars - As I mentioned I adore 150's womans fashion and Grace in this film is amazing, not only in her looks,but the wardrobe that she wears is one that I would die for, especially in my salad days.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|Your tech either didn't know what to do so insisted on new cord and cable or he was not understanding the problem. Please refer to comment above regarding  new charger.
B00A6CT012|5.0|I bought this ebook hoping to get some savvy tips and cool ideas I had not known about. Well I got those things but I also gained mentality of living with less... Much less! She says that they can put their wardrobe in a carry-on bag and head out at a moments notice!!!<br /><br />This book provides a holistic approach to zero waste living, not just homesteading.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Kid at heart, this movie is all he talked about.  We have a 3D Tv and my granddaughter came over and we all watched in 3D, would highly recommend.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This works great on my PC or on my 7 inch. Android Tablet.  I was going to get a Smart Phone, but now I don't need to!!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|First book of this series i ever read.  Nice to visit with Temperance  Brennan. Love the forensic level of work done.  Holds your attention.  Would venture to say I would read another one of Kathy's Reichs works again
