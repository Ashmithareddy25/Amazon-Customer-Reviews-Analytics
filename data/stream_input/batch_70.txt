B000AS3D3S|5|great
B002QUJ92C|3|they seem child size and make my eyelashes rub alot every time I blink... The padding functions well.<br />It is nice that they include the clear pair - I keep them in the saddlebag- clear for night-time and the dark ones as a spare
B003BZQ8XY|4|As described hood pins
B000CFS06E|5|It is good as it is supposed to. Easy installation, very high quality, I have being using them for years and I haven`t needed to replace any thing
B00YI2UTSE|2|Difficult to roll and unroll and store.  Not using it!
B00ELJLU3W|2|No grip on the bottom at all they slide right off.. Look good though fit nicely.
B0042KJV9U|4|Works well but needs to be used in subdued light, flash is quite dim.
B00FQ5IFJM|5|great siren  highly recommend getting very out , strong PA system and very good price!!!!<br />A+++++
B00MB0EXGE|5|I purchased diamond fasteners to use with this frame and I'm having a hard time...<br />I'm still working on it...will keep you posted.
B00P2RYKYS|5|Product came exactly as described and on time.  Works great.
B00KLT3JVC|3|I would have liked to know that it haves a constant LED under it that will still be on even with the car turned off.
B005R4L1N4|5|Came right on time! Fit great if you know what you're doing! Work great the signal doesn't flash too fast! It looks great if you install LED reverse lights! They seem to be really well made I would recommend them! Five stars!!
B00KSY3HFS|5|Bought for my 2004 Ford Escape, to small so I use it in my Jeep Comanche P.U..  It's a perfect fit!  It's funny how windshields have such a long angle to them these days, not the fault of these guys.
B007KPX5OG|5|nice !!!!!!!!!
B00ECTRBHA|5|For now, it looks great. It was easy to install.  I don't know how long it will last.
B00C88AA52|4|This replaced the screen door latch on our RV. I first ordered the wrong size, but this one is an exact replacement for the particular style on our RV door. I only used the latch part that goes on the door itself, not the part that attaches to the frame, because the original frame part was ok.
B0041PKF3W|1|This only lasted a season and half, poor customer support, would not recommend to anyone. Buy and winch and fit it to your ATV.
B000C57KGK|3|A rougher ride than I anticipated, but help keep my trailers under control behind my Suburban.
B00EECLMWK|5|They didn't fit my is300. But although they didn't fit Kensun went above and beyond to remedy the issue..very happy with their overall customer service . thank you Kensun
B00KB8BREO|5|good product
B00JBHY0PO|4|My 17 yr old nephew ordered these for his first car -- the blue was to match the car color. He is very happy with them and likes the way they look. No complaints.
B00P19W9TA|5|Might as well be weathertech, look the same and quality the same, fit 100% perfect in my 2015 polaris ranger 570
9539751047|5|Great colors and great quality!
B008LO2RJ4|1|Well part came 2 days before it was supposed to. But it didn't work... don't even know how I would return it
B001PYSAGQ|5|great product
B0016ID5O8|5|This is the second time I've bought these.  Stop great, no brake dust, and great quality.
B0057T45SM|5|nice bmw tag.
B00KRQFI7C|5|Easy on and look good.
B00KTIWM8Q|4|I bought this because I lost one of my transmitters for my 2005 Chevy Impala.  It was shipped quickly and works fine aside from the buttons being a bit sensitive.  Not a deal breaker for me...  Good price, quality product.
B00B8593GS|5|bought this, it showed up on time, fits my fixture and is plenty bright.
B00JXS39VC|5|Great. What can I say.
B003RVX0XI|5|This worked perfectly.  It is actually the second one I ordered (additional one for husband).
B0007ZAJQ8|5|This is better than a steering wheel lock. I like it. It will last for 20 years.
B00B9H590E|5|works great
B009AQS4IU|5|It goes really well wit my car,Love it :-)
B00IMPEWHM|5|fits great
B00NY0S2OY|4|Good cover, more for indoor use. Can't be the price though .
B00QFEJVG4|5|Use in 2015 Escape and love it!! It really helps keep stuff from rolling around. Can't believe how inexpensive it was.
B00OB8E1ES|2|Looks good on bikebut not made very good.<br />Alittle chincy looking<br />The cigarette. Lighter broke same day it was installed
B009B4B18G|5|Will buy again
B006Z9TZ9M|5|Awesome product.
B000BC976K|5|Sucks up water like no other. Hard to wring out but I bought 2 for precisely this reason. Does not leave streaks on a black car, which is very hard to come by.
B000J43FNG|1|Fits good. Doesn't roll up well and the material is too durable.
B000CMHEOG|5|They look great on my Mustang. Good quality too.
B000C83V2Y|5|store wanted $25 for this sensor, bought it here for much less and it is full quality item, worked perfect
B00062ZVC4|5|Great filter.  Fits my sons 06 Volvo s-60 as promised.  K&N is known for performance parts.  Easy to see the quality and feel it also.  Recommend<br />to Clean after 50 thousand miles!  And suppose to last the lifetime of the vehicle.  So, you spend a bit more up front for the filter but, you do not replace ever and you can clean them after 50 thousand- that speaks VALUE!
B00IKZTRLA|5|I absolutely love this and put it on the back of my pickup. I do wish it were just a teensy bit bigger, but the quality of this item is great. It went on well and will not be coming off until I take it off. One word of caution...you better get it on right the first time, no re-dos!
B00192KYFO|5|Good upgrade to the crappy standard shower-head that comes with most new campers.  More water volume --- which is great for a nicer shower, bad because hot water tank empties quicker and grey tank fills up quick
B003R2U3LE|3|Very stiff and cumbersome but does the job. In hindsight I would have bought cheap XL sunshades until I paid the equivalent of this ($50)
B0010DZZQU|5|Easy to install (30 seconds).  Works as expected, it seems.
B00WILYDVG|5|These chamois towels by far surpass any I have tried in the past 40 years!<br />Yes, I am 63 and have tried many and many! You will love these!<br />Don't even think about another brand. I have tried them and wasted my money.<br />THESE ARE FABULOUS!!!
B000FGIBYQ|5|worked great for me and my old Mercedes!!
B00VFCG3AS|5|Installed easy!
B004WCV1OG|1|They are almost Scentless. Would not buy again.
B004LGHPQ6|5|Solves idle issue and stuttering. I know my way around tools but definitely not under the hood of a car, so I watched a Youtube video on how to replace the coil packs in my 2007 Honda Fit and I easily saved $300-$400 by doing it myself! These are still working great.
B007Q1MLOO|5|Very pleased
B000EQ6IMY|5|I don't think i can say anything bad about them
B009XG714K|1|TO SMALL, NOT AS DESCRIBED, NOT WORTH THE EFFORT TO SEND BACK
B000FQ1T6I|5|About as good as it gets
B00EZD4CYI|5|This mirror matches my black 2012 Hyundai Elantra GLS perfectly. Installation is a breeze and the mirror works just like OEM. Very satisfied.
B00SKK4EXG|1|No good the gastket was poorly seal.
B007BZETK4|5|Very Nice
B00TI1ZZMA|5|Worked great
B001AS2798|5|Very Nice
B00H5XFG9U|5|Excellent product
B000CQ243S|5|Very Nice
B00QCNCY4E|5|Great device !!
B0027QR2SI|4|It hangs okay on the back of the seat, you can cinch the top closed, you can use a bread bag to line the garbage bag.  My complaint, it's smaller than my last one, which is crazy, right, who wants that much garbage in their car, but three kids, three juice boxes and it's full.  If I use it and there are no kids in the car, it's perfect for the occasional scrap of garbage.  It doesn't leak. It does everything else that it should.
B007O5GXOG|5|Excellent product. Delivered rite on time. Very happy with my purchace.
B00BVPOC20|5|Was able to repair my broken shifted myself
B0018C85VK|5|Easy to replace and works great on both pick-up shell doors I put them on.
B006WAMHVW|4|Definitely not great quality material but you get 2 covers for $20 and considering they fit my 2015 Hyundai Sonata Sport very well, it's a good deal. And they do not interfere with the heated seats just as they claim.
B00XQQ8192|4|Great quality, but ordered green and received blue. Extremely bright!! The bottom high beam bulb in the pic is supposed to be green.
B00DMIDUUY|5|Perfect!!!
B00NO8U6FO|5|Worked well and good pricing!  Fast shipping.
B00CS7ET9Q|1|Totally not satisfied. Sticker arrived in an envelope that was inside a packing bag. This poor packaging resulted in my sticker having creases in it. After I removed from said packaging,  I found the print quality to be poor and the white border hideous.
B00NT9IN12|5|Not only a car jumper but so much else!<br />This thing saved my car a few times already, not to mention it charges me or my passenger's phones when needed. It also serves as SoS light or just LED light for dark places!<br /><br />A MUST have for anyone who drives a car.
B000C9KSLU|5|awesome
B00RJUZY9Q|3|Does what it needs tom is very cheap and will break easily. is all plastic and the holders are a cheap made foam... all in all it will do what i need but has already cracked on the clip
B001PY9D2Q|5|So far so good
B003YBMDRU|5|Simply Awesome Product!!!
B00B6X7PGM|5|My edger now runs like new.
B0012ZEZ8A|5|This is an amazing kit that you could buy for your car. It has everything that you will ever need for maintaining your vehicle. I definitely recommend Meguiar's
B00B51YQVW|4|I found this spoilers quality to be quite good but the instructions were marginal. The six plastic hole marking system was more difficult to set up than if a paper template was used. The fact that the car trunk is double walked steel means drilling extra holes and thus making bolting the spoiler to the trunk lid challenging (the bolts were not steel) and I had to make my own device to install them. But I would recommend this spoiler it looks great now and I don't think of the cursing that was involved in this installation.
B00681BDXI|5|Thank You
B008BT5B6A|4|fit is good, appearance is good, but instructions are poor. I didn't know when I ordered that the cover came as one piece. The instructions didn't cover installing a one piece cover.
B00JDPUJKE|4|does reduce wind coming into helmet from the bottom. Its a mesh material so obviously air still make it in.
B00H1I5UCW|1|Does not fit F150, if you are wanting to retain the factory center caps.
B00AYI1DO0|5|I love the way they stry I'm place.
B0009N30EQ|4|Bought this on Amazon because no store I went to {WalMart,  Advanced Auto, etc.}  carried anything similar to what I wanted?!  this seems OK but am wondering if the Velcro back straps will eventually 'wear out'  and only time and use will tell that story.
B007HRNDJ4|4|Much better than the original ones I replaced!!
B0060YJ89O|5|Works  great, easy  to  install.
B000WJFSLU|4|I am always needing bulbs and these work for me
B003SS83SC|5|For son, he's very happy with these!
B0000AXTUY|5|Keeps batteries charged in Ford dual batteries all winter.
B003YNCPPS|5|This is an excellent filter.  Although it does not have as many pleats as the OEM filter, I find that it allows more air in without allowing debris or dirt past the filter.  This in turn has led to &#34; slightly &#34; better acceleration and fuel economy. I prefer this filter over the BMW OEM filter.
B0035XGPNA|5|I applied this to my wheels with a healthy level of skepticism, but it definitely works!<br /><br />The trick, though, is to make sure you get it on all surfaces.  I see plenty of black spots peeking out where I missed with the spray; next application will go better.<br /><br />It takes about 1/2 can to do 4 wheels, so you will probably want more than one can.
B000WJFYNW|2|Granted it did not cost much but I felt mine was low quality. My old one looked much better but broke at the bolt hole. Tge New one some of the holes were off a bit.
B0009IQXCM|5|Great product, easy to apply and remove leaving a fantastic shine. Really repels rain by beading up and blowing off leaving the car looking good. Very pleased with the product.
B001EAQTRI|4|Works Great.  My Astro MixAmp is prone to ground loop buzzing and noises, and adds quite a bit of DC offset voltage to it's output.  This Ground Loop Isolator eliminates both.  One issue is that the left and right channels are reversed, so I needed to use an adapter to correct this issue.
B00EKTM6PY|5|Exactly what I needed, I'm very happy with my purchase. Thanks again
B00AQ7972O|5|Worked like a charm. 2010 VW GTI with a CTS downpipe with a high flow 200 cell cat. I used the middle sized jet. I'm at 200 miles after clearing the code and the CEL hasn't come back.<br /><br />A note on the install: I had to remove the downpipe's front hanger plate so that I could push the pipe aside in order to thread on the spacer. Once installed, there is plenty of room for it to fit, but for the first few revolutions the J spacer was hitting the wall of the heat shield.
B00KNFJUGW|5|Fits quite well and looks good.
B003DNJ728|5|I haven't tried. But it looks good, thick enough
B00J00X7QK|5|This is by far the most cost effective way to buy Mobil 1 that I've come across.
B000KKDP5M|4|good
B001FIDNGO|3|Seems a bit clunky fell apart after a few months.
B00LH99TW8|5|So far so good. Bright and nice color. I've had bulbs from Apex burn out in less than a year but their customer service is superb and for the price/fast shipping, very worth it.
B000BO68VU|5|good
B00JGJGCV2|5|What can I say its a cable, worked perfect for my needs to make a disconnect for the RV battery, nice quality.
B006TXCMF8|3|I'm giving 3 because the back seats cover very difficult to put. Please post the video also how to  put cover on the back seats. Otherwise cover is good as price.
B000F14AG4|5|looks great
B00C598L9G|5|This product has been around for a long time, because it works great in the rainy states and in the Mojave desert, after many miles and a few years. I imagine this would last for a decade on a mobile home or a park model, just because they aren't moving. Just follow the directions.
B000TYOQVQ|5|Knobs fit perfit
B004GZKVEA|5|Happy Happy Happy.....
B001GJ7HCI|5|Bette results than chemicals...!
B00RV46YBC|5|These leds r extremely bright n look awsome! Fast shipping as well.
B00DP61IAW|5|works fine love it
B00092RESK|5|Extremely easy to use.  It's been 3 weeks since I applied to car and it has a good shine and beading water very well.
B00XP9XKHI|1|Ripped putting it on
B000C5G106|5|Genuine part perfect fit and function.
B00F3XBPBW|5|Good product
B000C1WD9I|4|Very fine
B00PT18QAQ|3|Looked used and it was scratched. Purge button seems flimsy
B00ISJX67E|5|Great look, fits just right.
B00CJHCXD4|5|Fit Perfectly on my EK Hatchback DX 2000! Would definitely recommend these mounts to anyone
B004QPB59U|3|Shipped on time and in great condition. My problem with this shield is that it is SUPER fragile. The first day I rode with it on, a few bugs splattered on the shield, which is totally normal. The problem was when I got home and used a microfiber towel and water to wipe them off, the Shield started scratching like crazy! these were tiny little insects, not bees or horseflies...<br /><br />It seems like the coating process was pretty fresh (or low quality) when I received it or something, other than that I love the look and the perfect fit!<br /><br />for the low price, I would probably just buy one every year or two...
B003L2XPLA|4|good
B00C7Z4O4Y|5|WORKS PERFECT
B00K534WKG|5|Great. Fast delivery
B00A3TB64M|4|FINALLY! A product that removed the water spots on my car windows! I was losing hope but this product, with a little more effort than expected, works better than anything else I have tried.
B00OOBXAGW|5|Good quality!
B00J1KUX6G|5|Easy to install and love the look it gave my truck.
B00JWWD9AU|5|Its working just great for my car and the best place to order because it comes in as a set!
B007TZ2XK4|4|I stuck this over the logo on my Mac Book Pro over a year ago.  I'm more proud of being a Cowboys fan than a Mac lover.  I cut the star out of the paper with a little edge on it, peeled it and stuck it on.  It was 6 months later that I realized I had left a backing on it.  The backing was starting to lift and I thought &#34;what a piece of crap&#34; then I noticed that the star itself was stuck just fine!  I removed the backing and now I'm very happy with it.
B002AQ42MO|5|As described
B005TY29FG|5|Fits great and looks nice
B002EW5FWU|5|This stuff works great. Spray it on, wait a few seconds and the bugs wipe right off. Even after being baked on for a few days. Hardly any residue from the product left on the vehicle. I just followed up with a microfiber cloth and the vehicle was positively clean. Going to order another bottle to have on hand. Hope they don't stop making it.
B00MB0E1WK|3|Personally, just did not like the feel, but loved the colors!
B000FUNZF2|5|Best lubricant on the Market!
B000C9P17Q|4|Good fit, but it did pull the cumber of the wheel off to the point where they had to drill new holes for the shocks to fix the cumber when I took it in to get an alignment.
B000C9PZ9K|5|exact replacement
B000GZRBII|5|I thought I would save money getting a cheap version of this. When I got it I discovered it came from China.  I tried it.  It lasted three months.  I don't even remember the brand so I can't warn you.<br /><br />Yuasa would last me years even given my tendency to neglect them.  I was short on cash and thought I'd go with a bargain brand at an online battery store.  Learned the classic lesson.<br /><br />The battery is shipped dry. Remember to order the battery electrolyte too.  In well stocked auto parts stores you should find motorcycle battery electrolyte in smaller bottles rather than the car battery sized electrolyte bottles which would fill several motorcycle batteries. (Boat parts stores would have that too for the small boats.)  Anyway ask, as I did, as they may not put motorcycle or any battery electrolyte out on the shelves. Or order it the same time as the battery just for the convenience.
B00EECM5FI|5|if every body know that u may get hid  bulb from amazon  cheep price then people may happy about that parchace  thank u very much amazon people god bless u
B00HVHNP5C|5|Very good in protecting remote when keys are dropped.
B000COS07O|5|Great product, they went on my 2007 Dodge Ram 1500 crew cab with ease and they look great.
B009YEYLWQ|5|Easy to use, does what it is supposed to.
B00IVWFLV2|2|I ordered the frame on  January 26, 2015 and I was very pleased after I installed it. The Quality appeared great but I was wrong because the paint is already falling off and it looks terrible. Also a screw cover has fallen off.<br />I've requested a replacement because I really like the looks of it but it's still disappointing that it lasted less than a year and for $40.00 it should have lasted at least until after the coming Chicago winter.<br />It would have gotten 5 stars in looks alone but due to paint issue and missing cap it should really be less than 2 stars but I'm feeling hopeful that it will be replaced.
B004GCEV76|5|Installed in 12 mins. Works real well. GM chg's $200 + $100 shop labor!!
B00CC2ZUHM|1|Absolute worst headlights I ever bought!! Don't do it! I had three different sets, and all have either not worked from the start, or have lasted a week or two. Terrible product and I won't buy again. I used to be from plasma garage, but didn't want to pay the extra cash, so I went cheap. And you get what you pay for.
B000CK4Y3C|5|Fit perfectly looked like the original
B0097TWG7K|5|Amazing light. Last about 3 hours so I bought 2 for a normal work day. You only need to use one at a time to get more then enough light to work even in complete darkness, no heat, small, and you can use em while charging but I tried not too.
B0001UZUW2|5|For the price, this is a solid tool to keep in the house.
B00DSD5ASS|4|Nice.
B007S2PVKC|5|Fit perfectly on my 03 KTM 525! I'm very pleased, and it even arrived very quickly!
B004A2YSA2|4|Works great so far, did have to change plug in trailer to use, was not showed the end when purchased.
B00AR9G6XO|5|very nice add on
B00IT6O5F8|5|It's a filter, and I assume it filters stuff pretty well.  My tranny fluid is always clean when it comes out. (that's what Caitlyn Jenner said)
B001CJHU9W|2|the clamp that holds on the valve stem does not work well on some which makes it um-usable for those application without a third hand.<br />Should be setup to take an air chuck and trigger but I think they were going for use anywhere.<br />I wanted it because the gauge goes down low and needed something for my ATV's but it wont hold onto the stem's/
B00DU24YKW|5|I am a true believer into putting back factory parts into your vehicle, which is AC Delco in my case. Very good product and you do need a Spark Plug Gap tool because these are not pre gaped so you will need to do so. I also recommend replacing Spark plug wires as well because most people break the old wires trying to take them to get to the spark plugs, plus if your do for knew spark plugs you're probably do for new wires
B009GJ322Y|5|Best Mud Flaps on the market and the best customer service I have ever gotten. Just buy them. It fits perfect and looks amazing. Blocks all kinds of debris from hitting the side of the car.
B005DTLB2O|5|I use this brush to clean my interior of dust.  Keep it in my glovebox so it's readily available.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|Great for all leather products!
B000C2YCH8|5|I replaced a Dayco belt that had slight dry rot and was making noise. This new belt is dead silent, I'm thrilled!
B00J09G62S|5|perfect fit
B0014I1BRI|5|So, initially I thought was going out on a limb with this purchase. I read all the other reviews about the intake noise and increased performance, but who's to say that my car won't be different? Well, it wasn't. I installed this in my 2001 Honda Accord with the 3.0L V6 and it's like a have a new car (sort of). Except for the slight &#34;hiss&#34; of the intake when the car starts up, there is no perceptible difference in the car unless the engine is under heavy load or after V-TEC kicks in. Once V-TEC kicks in, there is just this _fantastic_ intake ROAR. I haven't measured the noise level, but I'd guess at least 75-80 decibels. I can't verify if the car is any quicker at higher rpm, either, but it sure seems like it.<br /><br />My favorite part is that the car is as docile as ever when you're on the highway, but a roaring monster when you're leaving a stoplight.<br /><br />Tip - If you're thinking of getting this, I'd recommend grabbing the Injen Technology X-1033BLK Black Hydro-Shield while you're at it. Definitely worth the money.
B00VE39A12|4|Incredible mirrors!!! Come with smoked clear lenses abd leds too! Mirrors are perfect no cracks or scratches! Everything hooked up perfectly.....WIRES DO NOT MATCH AT ALL.. PLUG AND PLAY
B006SYNF9K|5|Works perfectly in my Hyunda Santa Fe! Cute design too.
B000E2CVI8|5|Come on its k&n
B0067UD0NG|5|06 Trailblazer SS 2WD with 130k miles here.<br />Was skeptical that the parts store wanted $300/ea. Cross-referenced part #s online until I came to these. I was even more skeptical when they were $60/ea online. I work in the manufacturing sector, so I know it's generally only a couple places in the world that make these things. Anyhow, these came with the ABS sensors and everything. Had them both changed in just an hour with air tools.<br />This same part number works for both sides, and comes with all new wire clips already installed. Order 2 per vehicle
B003CSYP4E|5|perfect fit, easy to install
B00DQEOE7W|1|Do not buy, it does not work properly turn off after 1 minute, bad costumer service.
B008EEYTRE|5|Had my local guy install this kit and was told by him this is the most complete and OEM set he has seen. He said the HYDRAULIC tensioner is almost never included.  I stupidly waited till 152k to have the 105k service done.....the only service I have ever put off by the way.  But mechanic told me the original parts were still in great shape, including the belt.  Huge sigh of relief....not to mention saved several hundred $$$  Buy with confidence
B000CM3IEG|4|great replacement
B0009XQUK2|5|as described. Thanks!
B005RJ3GBE|3|Product itself was okay but came with no instructions. Almost had a bad day when I didn't know there was a transponder chip left in the old key. Luckily the trash guy hasn't come yet.
B000COMXCM|5|Great little item used to store your wheel lock key. It slides on your lug nut wrench for easy keeping and I also use the pouch to store the original lug nuts I took off when I replaced them with the wheel locks.
B00TMFBHO2|5|Great magnet. Love it on my car. Came fast.
B00J5CVLUC|5|Easy to apply and leaves a beautiful shine.
B00YA4E08U|5|Easy plug and play.  I put them on a 2015 Polaris rzr and they are extremely bright !!
B00DCX96I4|5|Nice quality product.
B00Y90JVH0|5|Great
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I've been skeptical of these sun shades but living in Central Texas and dealing with the 100+ degree heat I figured why not give it a try. My car sits in the sun all day at work and by the time I leave for the day the inside is like an oven. The steering wheel is almost impossible to touch. Ive been using this sun shade for the last two days and my car has to be at least 15 or 20 degrees cooler. I don't get darn near 2nd degree burns from the steering wheel and can actually touch it now without having to run the AC for ten mins before leaving. It is a little tricky at first getting the shade packed back into the carrying case/bag so the trick is to fold it in half and again like a figure 8. You think that you are going to bend the wires inside that make it into the shape but it pops right back out when you need to take it out again.When it is in its bag its about the size of a small dinner plate so its not like those other foldable stiff sun shades.All and all happy with this thing and I will be ordering another one for my wife's car.
B001BS9K3I|5|Great Product
B0131EZTVQ|5|I love this mini trash can.  The lid is very secure so I don't have to worry about spills.  I just push my tissue, gum wrapper or toothpick into the hinged opening and voilà, no more trash laying about.  Very convenient and super easy to empty.  I received this product at a discounted price, in exchange for my honest review.
B0031HNHQI|5|Works great and was easy to install
B007FFWJ20|1|Starts to peel and leaves it on my dashboard
B00GCAUW1Y|5|Well made and easy to work with. Installation is a breeze when using the right installation method. I highly suggest you visit the 1060graphics.com website to watch there installation video if you've never installed any type of stripes or graphics before. If you've ever installed stripes or large graphics before, this item will be very easy to install with the same methods and techniques.
B000ALBSDW|5|No more having the rear window hit my head. This was just like the OEM ones i took off. Works great and I would buy from this seller again.
B00G9AIBMO|5|good fit
B003H6HYJY|5|Sturdy
B003OXUPOQ|5|This item is a great help for the DYI'ers. But Be ware that on the 2012/2013 Honda Civic 1.8 engine the rear motor mount on the lower right side of the engine will not allow you to thread the drain valve in without removing the lower mount. Depending on the closeness of the 90 degree section of the valve, the mounting boss on the engine block may also restrict you from being able to thread it in completely. In either case, a quick drain valve with the shut off lever assembly straight out (no 90) will assure this item to work on your Honda.
B00HLV1BMW|5|A truly amazing helmet! Not only does it look awesome, its vibrant in color, distinct, and is a head turner. Plus for the money its worth its a steal! Get yourself one!!
B00BJCHTFW|4|I wish these were a little thinner for lower profile tires but these have held up extremely well compared to competitors ive used in the past.
B00J5KRUHM|5|Very satisfied.  The model I received has clever snap on side braces to keep it from collapsing ( comments from others have been addressed).  Perfect size for me.
B005G21JP2|5|this part worked as it should
B00W31VMYC|2|It works good but the apps that come for free are out dated and no longer available I had to buy the app also
B00ARUQSQS|5|Exactly as described
B002CFQNM0|5|Looks good. Heavy duty. More then I'll ever need. Safer then steel cable.
B00JVQG1UC|5|Excellent quality. Easy on-off and easy to secure. Kept our stored travel trailer clean-dry and protected. Love it!
B00KPQYZ6O|3|Easy enough to install and works after a fashion but if your trailer is low to the ground like my race trailer be prepared to lay on the ground and bench press this mother up and onto the mount bracket. Fits up close to the trailer bottom and my spare is no longer taking up space so that's a plus. Would have been worth 5 stars if it were a bit easier to wrangle back up under the trailer with a tire on it.
B005VMJ5U8|3|Not quite right. Fits, but the connector on the back is opposite than the plug on the Jeep. Had to reuse original light socket. Maybe this is for pass side?
B008FCD0SE|5|aaa/dealer part .direct fit.very easy to install
B00669H5T8|5|too cute!!! I love it!!!
B00U6VOYI2|5|2015 Ford F150 5'6&#34; bed. Love this cover. It took me only 15 minutes to install first time. Simple instructions. I was curious about the included foam tape having to be installed at the bulk head as some reviewers for other covers have stated. I did not install and still no leaks for now. We'll made product.
B00YOZ4BXE|2|They are easy to put on but a little pricy. They were worth it until I got them and put them on my jeep and they don't fit a 50 light bar. It's made for a 48 in light bar.
B007AMC8C4|4|Easy to replace and worked perfect right out of the box.  Installed a month ago with no issues yet.  Only gripe is I had to go buy a screw. It came with 2 screws for electrical connections but it needed 3.<br />2002 mercury 2 stroke 90hp
B00Q7HV6NA|2|fair
B00I62XFF6|1|Lame it's plastic
B000C16XBM|1|There was a lot of slop window tweaks and gets stuck half way up doesn't work any better than the one I replaced
B002UC17GW|5|very good product easy install nice and bright
B00W2XDK96|5|Exceeded my expectations and have lasted &#34;  many carwashes
B00ICISVTY|5|Incredible light, bought a second one for a family member. Very durable and bright.
B00KGJFEZ6|5|The sticker is very useful, nice price and nice service.
B0023WAGBG|2|Nice!!
B00AN5UTXA|5|Great price and great product!  Easy install and fit perfectly!
B005FM0WLU|5|Had some front end damage after an encounter with the back end of a larger truck, this replacement part fit my truck perfectly and after I painted it to match, my truck looks even better than before. original grill was chrome, but a new chrome grill was going to cost upwards of $200 and this one was less than $50. My truck is black, so painted new grill black to match and it looks great.
B00KPR0ZEE|4|just as described...quick delivery..thank you
B00N58M6CO|1|Connector burn out after first use...
B00IOBQDTY|5|Awesome
B00JN0U4SQ|1|This product is horrible.  First off it does not work in an 06' Tacoma.  The screws they provide are not long enough to make any type of radio connection.  Second off the black paint faded off completely leaving the antenna a rustic gold within 3 day, such bulls***.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!  I wasted my money and missed the return day, don't make the same mistakes as me!!
B0076DAI1A|4|Love it!
B00C4YPLK4|5|Really great spray to replace the reDONKulously-priced Plexus I used to buy. Good price, odor is tolerable and decent, good performance for cleaning windscreens, helmet visors, etc. and is all around useful where I can't use Windex or a Quick Detailer.
B000A8OVHU|5|Best plugs you can buy.
B007Y85U2E|5|Awesome price and exact fit.
B004W8M6KS|5|Love them, the are a perfect match to the floor mats.
B004HDY8XQ|5|Acdelco quality. Exact fit. Great price. I would purchase these again. I bought these to replace squeaky Wagner brake pads.
B008QDE43W|1|Don't use in a dark car Leaves a smeary residue that is very hard to get off.followed directions my car looked terrible after using it.Ended up having to clean it and re wax it with another brand
B006ZPP680|5|Worked as described
B00B36CC56|5|good paint -- lovely color -
B000R5G0DO|5|Good weapon to have in your tool arsenal.
B003UM9GDM|4|Great product!
B0086OE2FQ|5|Nice upgrade
B008VLVDII|4|Nice, but I wish I had known it can't go over the side airbags. It is a little big for my Chevy Cruze, but otherwise nice.
B000IYPSB4|5|Fits nicely
B00PLD3WEW|2|So I've been using this product for a little while now and I can honestly say, I can tell much of a difference from when I leave it unplugged for a day or when I have it plugged in all day. The blue light is nice at night when driving, because it kind of illuminates the cab, but as far as anything else, I can't say it does much.
B00L32KR70|4|Easy to install and works great!
B000GZTB8Q|5|Great
B00884ZDT8|5|great for small area but for big attic not so much, maybe 6 of them would work better.
B004C6TZE0|4|it's a pin for use where thieves are not a problem
B00UWVTS0K|1|PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WATERPROOF. KEEP YOUR MONEY IN YOUR WALLET.
B007Z2PTFW|4|works great , but takes up room
B00MAG6RMM|4|First off I chose this instead of the other 10 pcs for 11.99 because I thought it would be more premium and brighter. Wrong... only 5 of ten works and the brightness is just ok. Same as oem bulbs when I bought my car but instead it's just white. Hopefully amazon fixes this cause $19 is most definitely not small money. I'm starting to even doubt the duration of the ones I have installed today.<br /><br />Update: company offered to give refund or give me replacements. I need replacements so I chose that. They're asking me to give them better review but it's now 2 weeks since we talked about giving me replacements. Seems pretty shady to me.<br /><br />Update: changing 1 star to 4 for replacement only.<br />Product I would say is decent lighting as oem and just white.
B0009IQZH0|5|Great for car detailing!
B0031I8046|5|Great rotors at a good price. Exact fit. Nice quiet braking.
B00ZKTXJA4|5|They worked better then I anticipated, and look really good. I used them for my dome and map lights. They seem to be built really well also. I put them in a 2000 Subaru Forester, and thy didn't require any modifications or bending of the metal to make them fit.<br />I am very happy and satisfied with my purchase and am looking to ordered 2 more for my 2009 Subaru WRX.
B00713G3GE|1|BEWARE!!! YOU WON'T GET ALL YOUR MONEY BACK IF YOU RETURN ANY THINGS FROM THIS COMPANY!!! Be 100% that what you are ordering will work.
B005CHFD62|5|Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised. Very high quality. I recommend to others in the community.
B000C5C9EI|5|Fit for a 2007 Chevy Malibu.
B000GZSZO2|5|I will say, I biased to these grips, I have fitted them to many bikes and they are always awesome, comfort, fit and looks are rock solid.  There is a reason why they sell and you see so many fitted to bikes.
B000CJ6CWE|5|Bought these to put in my Saturn SL2.  These are the only spark plugs I use and I replace them every 30,000 miles (174,000 on the odo and climbing).  It keeps the car running smooth.  If you cannot use Iridium, these are a great alternative.
B003NX41K6|3|Pink faded rather quickly. ...
B00FTAXHE2|5|Received earlier than expected and were very easy to replace and work great!
B009IFIGIG|5|Absolutely pleased.  It was a perfect fit for a 2007 Chevy Silverado new body style.  The heating element strip isn't as large as it was on the OEM mirror and probably won't last as long, but overall a great value OEM replacement.
B00V30J86I|1|Not good at all. Tried to put it in my SUV and the straps are too short and non of our cars have any kind of open holes to attach the straps. At the bottom.  It will not stretch long enough to clip at the top and at the bottom even if I had the supposed holes on the seat railing. Very disappointed in this purchase! Beware when buying this and try it in your car as soon as you get it. I was buying it for a future car and by the time I received the car my window for return was over.
B000FCH1Y6|5|Good fit
B0012TURT2|5|Great product. Fast shipping
B00CMTM9QA|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B00BI519Q0|5|Happy customer will definitely do business with again.
B00GHR30NY|5|fit perfectly and so far so good
B001DRFIZQ|5|exact fit high quality brake
B0076UN4H8|3|Wish it would've come w new bushings
B000HS9ZGU|5|Comes out of the hole like a rocket now!
B00274JM7E|5|I traded in my more spacious car for an electric vehicle, so I had to lose the kleenex box and get creative.  This uses dead space on my passenger side visor and my husband didn't even notice it until I pointed it out.  It holds standard rectangular-sized tissues, so save the plastic that came with it and just refill it to save some money and have softer tissues.
B00ESZUFH6|4|Great helmet. The rear mirror works nicely even in the night and you need 2 weeks or so to get used to it. The fit is very good and it is very silent. I'm using with a Bluetooth Sena and works very nice inside the helmet. It's has the space to put the speakers and you can't feel the speakers pressing your ears like some other helmets.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Very silent specially when you close the shield<br />- Very comfortable<br />- The rear view works great even in the dark (of course you don't have a sharp view but you can distinguish everything)<br />- Your head don't sweat as much as other helmets even when is 30o outside so I think the wind flow system works very well<br /><br />CONS<br />- The finishing is not so well done like Shark or other famous helmets<br />- If you use glasses, because of the shape of the helmet they don't get to the end of your head. The glasses stick at the middle of your nose<br />- You need to constantly clean the shields because any touch leaves a big mark specially in the rear shield
B002BVXM92|1|This product had lots hype.i tried it and it didnt fix my catalyc converter problem.
B001U8QS9I|1|Virtually NO installation instructions.WTF!?  Sitting next to clothing  dumpster now. ..BYE BYE. 35 BUCKS LOST. BETTER THAT THAN AN ADDITIONAL 50 TO FIND SOMEONE TO FIGURE EM OUT N PUT EM ON.
B002W30A4E|5|All good
B00009PGNR|1|Absolutely terrible item. It broke even before I used it.  I returned it and got my money back less shipping.
B000IYPQXO|1|When I received this item it was severlely bent!
B000C9QQSE|5|Part had different color wire than what my truck had, it also would not clip completely to the light board. However, that being said. Part works fine,<br />delivery was great, good value.
B00HY6ICSK|5|It was a breeze to put on and looks great.  Order this stripe you won't be sorry.
B000YS7N7G|4|I love the way these boots look, and they were very comfortable. I never wear anything but sneakers, so at first I felt like they were a bit clunky, but after I wore them a while they were fine. The  only reason I'm not giving a full 5 stars is because they are big enough that it makes it difficult to shift.
B00QRHDIPY|3|Purchased to help maintain a travel trailer battery during the week when not in use. After 4 weeks of use, I've only had one weekend where the battery had charge in it. I've checked for parasitic drain (there is very little) and the battery is less than a year old. Seems like a nice solar charger/maintainer but isn't working for an travel trailer in storage application - maybe I need to go with the 14W version.
B00G6IT3F8|1|was not the color advertised. its way to light. my gm interior is black. this color is gray. it needs to be labeled different  I still have not bought anything yet as a replacement. I'm going to go to the auto parts store and actually look at the next can of dark graphite.
B001KS2R34|4|This was incredibly easy to install and I avoided paying a lot more to have an auto shop install a new one. Definitely recommend anyone looking at these to get them and install it yourself.
B0031GRUD0|3|it was what i was looking for but the key in my opinion did not work well. after a month the key broke pff inside the cap and i could not lock  it.
B00BZVYM98|5|Great item and quick shipping.
B00GUF74HQ|5|Works great.  Easy to install on a 2014 Dodge Ram 1500.
B00LMGG8G6|3|This motors a great purchase for the price but I do recommend buying the upgraded performance carb.<br />Pro's vs cons. More power but the mileage drops depends on your riding style. Other than that it's great!
B00Q2NZ6LC|5|Perfect fit and works like new. Easy to change.
B000CQ6C9K|5|Bought these for my Mom's '04 Toyota Corolla.  They fit perfect, I only had to trip a small bit off the driver's mat - I used a razor knife and it came clean off.  There's no issue with the odor that other people are mentioning, I hung them outside for a day before installing them and it made the rubber smell deplete a great deal.
B00OBWKHRO|5|Shipped Fast, easy to assemble. Once I set the width to match the grooves on the spools I am able to get the bike on and off the stand by myself with no assistance.
B00HJE5GI6|5|A good red color but so bright it may look orange/pink close up, but that is just your eyes not knowing what to do with so much red light. A very rich red color when when you look at the light it casts. So far no issues, works well and is about twice as bright as my stock bulbs were. I'm using these as turn signals so no idea if they get hot if used as running lights
B00P2VLFK6|5|My lights were crazed and turn signals cracking. This set gave me all 4 for a fraction of the OME. The lights arrived in timely fashion, well packaged, even with a headlight bulb in place. You must transfer you turn signal bulbs.<br />The lights are pretty much ready to insert with the exception of the clip that the turn signals connect to. It was inserted backwards. Pry it out and turn it around and ready for business. The head lights are fulling adjustable. On my 2000 Olds Silhouette, the lights were never aligned because of the self leveling. The pump went out and I had air shock put in so I pulled out my torx driver and adjusted them. One headlight would not fully adjust. An email to the seller and a replacement was on the way. Great service.<br />When you first put them in, the turn signal seems to be misaligned. Get the headlight adjusted and the turn signal will pretty much align up with home.
B00QFY2BCK|3|product crears up lens but then lens start to get foggy again after a few months
B00HWI3J38|5|fit just as stated  sure makes it nice to get into truck
B004QV4NIO|5|works great
B00D3YEGO6|5|They stand out on my Mercedes very sparkly
B000E3CYIY|5|I have been using this for a year or so, and it is really comfortable and when I need to can put it off the steering wheel quickly and put in the washer.<br />Living in Phoenix, Arizona, you need something like this on your steering wheel in the summer when it is 110 degrees.
B003SOKEXI|2|This is NOT Illuminated like the original OEM switch!  The arrows and letters are not visible in the dark unlike the OEM which has green light.<br />This has to be disclosed in the description !  Other than that fits and works just like OEM.
B002L9D72Q|4|worked well for my application
B00CHDCCQI|5|very good
B00M8UHSX2|5|Great
B004G1Z0FY|5|This is a nice quality item.  The material is a lightweight fabric that likely would not stand the test of time out in the weather, but my purpose is to hang this flag inside the garage.  For that use, it is perfect.  The printing is good quality and the colors are exactly as represented in the image.
B000E4CON8|4|I really like this large rear view mirror but it would not fit over my Honda Accord 2009 rear view mirror, but I will still keep it for a friend.
B0011YTZAU|5|Happy with my puchase.
B008YFT054|5|These light are crisp makes my car look upgraded thanks receive fast on time and nothing was broke easy to install
B002FPC85I|5|It's marine rated 5/8&#34; fuel/vapor house, what else can be said? They did get it out to me quickly
B00Y5MPMS4|4|Better than I thought it would be. Nice construction.
B006ZXQ5CI|2|paint did no stay where i put it, and the brush was too big for small spot
B0054DALPW|5|very good and fit on my 2014 road king
B001CQWM8E|5|It is a huge help
B000M5ZXIM|2|I only had it about a month and the frame where the casters ride became loose and elongated one of the frame caster mounts. The frame is no good anymore because you can't tighten caster.  I went over every caster and they were all loose. I recommend assembling this with blue loctitte to prevent this from happening.
B0009KMHLQ|5|Definitely the product to use if you need to get your leather seats back in shape! I did not realize to use this instead of the Lexol Conditioner until your seats are where you want them to be.
B008EEYWKI|4|Finally decided to do timing belt in my 2003 Toyota Tundra;  232,000 miles on it.  Yup,  that's right.<br />The original belt was in good shape,  no cracks,  could have gone another 100k miles.<br />Bearings had a bit of play in them, but no noise it grinding,  Idk how much longer they would have been good.<br />Pump had a leak  at the bottom, but I had no overheating issues at all in the southern California sun.<br />The mechanic that did the job was impressed at how good the original parts were still.<br />He works mainly on Euro sedans,  Audis, Bmws, and what not, and he said euros timing belts break at 110k miles.<br />Aisin stuff is dealer,  I just hope the Mitsubishi timing belt will last like the Toyota one,  so I don't have to do timing belt another 200k miles.<br />Btw, I didn't use my truck for heavy stuff,  95% of the driving was just commuting,  a lot of that was on highway no traffic.<br />I gave it 4 stars because the belt was not original Toyota,  but I'm hoping that it's actually the same belt but branded for Mitsubishi. If that's the case, then big 5 ol stars from me
B000IY9HK2|5|Great rotors. Quiet and the epoxy coating should hold back the rust.
B00Y5FXL48|5|Great cuality
B004SX5HM6|1|Got these lights for my boyfriend. We put them in his truck and the switch box broke when he went to use them for the first fire call with the new set up. Very unhappy with them.
B00Z7KIZPA|4|I like the purse pouch, but unfortunately my purse won't fit in it.  I do have girls that will be able to use them.
B00I93W3VO|5|Valves fit and work well.
B00C7Z4LY2|4|This cover doesn't fit my whole bike because not it length but its width. I wouldn't recommend this cover if you have a wide bike.
B00NLP6SNE|5|Great product!  Easy install.
B00K889FCI|4|It was not as easy or simple as the advertising indicated.It was a lot more work but the results were good.The advertisment should show the full procedure it falls a little short of false advertising
B00092893E|5|This is the only additive that has science behind it working. Techron has pretty good results.
B00TK2MN4U|1|Missing the Cam Locks. Buy one with them already installed
B00KHUQ9NK|1|Dryrotted
B007TG7HV8|3|Worked well at first, and lasted well through a Michigan winter. However, after a very wet spring and summer, it started to streak really bad to the point where using them actually made my windshield worse. A little disappointed these didn't even last a year, as my previous and cheaper wipers lasted at least 2 years under similar conditions.
B00D2QL0DU|5|works great makes cleaning my turtle tank eazy
B000C8T8OO|4|Was the same or better quality than oem
B00NXRXXMO|5|Blades work GREAT! Easy install and look nice. time will tell ... Great Value for the  2013 Mustang
B00UC4IK1K|5|Product worked perfectly. The instructions included with the tool are actually better than the instructions in the service manual. Great purchase, I will be back!!
B004X5QMY6|5|the radiator was an exact fit  for half the price!! and let's not forget the free shipping, Part arrived in three days!!
B00HAWJODU|5|Perfect fit!  Very easy to install.
B00MWNZ1E8|5|Bosch never fails !!!
B00NA6QEE2|5|Looks adorable!!!
B00B7R71LG|5|Hit it with some 100 grit, and black enamal. Looks factory.
B00HHNRPWY|3|Caps included are meant for very large bolts. Camaro RS lettering is raised and feels like a sticker. I will see how it holds up. My PA plate did not entirely fit into the cutout measurements but I was able to make it work. Frame feels like sturdy metal that has a solid construction aside from the lettering. If lettering holds up well I will update this to 4 stars.
B00XP97HEA|3|Fitted these mudguard on a 2014 Q5 2.0T with 245/55/19 tires.  The guards were made of good quality material and the fit was adequate but not custom so it does appear as an addition to the vehicle and not as an original fitted OEM accessory.  However, given the price compared to the original mud guards from Audi, I can't complain.  The mounting holes lined up with the original vehicle screws so there was no need to do any modifications or drilling.  It was easy to install the front guards as the wheels could turn to allow access to work.  The rear guards were more difficult given that the space was restricted and one may have to remove the rear wheels to install the guards but this can be avoided using a short handled screwdriver (but make sure it is a torx head to fit the original screws).  I suggest reusing the original screws as the supplied screws were too short and the screw heads too small.
B0089LSKFY|5|good stuff.
B003RVYL4A|5|works perfectly with my Nissan pathfinder
B000NPGX9E|5|Just like the one it replaced
B00RHQBNMY|5|I love these tubular tissues! Having a compact vehicle and liking to take turns non-too-slowly, standard box tissues simply get tossed around a lot in the back like a rag doll. The Kiss-u sits nicely in my backseat cupholders, and with a plastic lid to close it when not in use, this is an idea travel companion and I can also stow extras in the trunk or in the glovebox. I am very happy with this product.
B00FTDJ9FA|5|These are the best bulbs around!
B002OPAIWE|5|as described, looks great. accents the cowl and windshield perfectly.
B004V4ENGI|4|Thin wires,  but it is the correct guage for the power draw. They seem solid, and pretty bright. Good, chrome finish
B002V0TREC|5|Did lots of research over the web and visiting shops. Why? thought the price was too steep for the product. Finally pulled the Trigger and bought it. Assembly was easy. There is one stage where you will need another set of hands but that should be expected. With the cowl and windshield my bike look completely different.
B005OKBNXE|3|The fit was ok, the welds look good and at one point it looked like it had a nice paint job, but when I opened the box the hitch was beat to hell.<br /> It looked like it had been tossed around the warehouse for years, chipped, scratched, dented, gouged and dusty dusty dirty.<br />I almost thought it was used but there was no signs of mounting ware.<br />I haven't towed anything yet but as long as it does what it's supposed to do and does not break I'll be ok with it.<br />I just cant believe a company would sell something as new that looked that bad and you would think they might have mentioned that it was scratched to hell.
B0070Y341G|4|Very nice and fit without issues
B004C46ISS|2|I realy don't know to used
B00HLABBK0|5|Used these to replace the OEM ones for my 1972 BMW 2002.  Worked great.  Same size, though the top is slightly different.  But they fit and work perfectly.
B00278MDFS|5|Good price and correct fit
B00WGPFK4I|5|I purchased three of these for my wife and I for our vehicles.  Two for my truck because I bought it from a smoker and one for my wife.  All three worked great initially, however within a couple of days one of them started clicking.  I will say that they do help clean up the air as my truck is smelling better.  I have shampooed and scrubbed it several times but some of the last vestiges of that smoking still remain.  These things seem to be clearing that up.  I give it five stars because the product works as advertised.  I did get a bad one; but the company has been proactive about emailing me to see how I like my products.  I told them about the one I had an issue with and they promptly provided me a replacement one.  Good product and especially for this day and age; fantastic customer service.  Highly recommend.
B003RY53U8|5|they are real good coffee mugs they work real good
B00FQ0ROZS|3|I I am me speechless don't know what to say
B004MYJ7QI|4|Super heavy chains. Fit well on our fifth wheel trailer that has a gooseneck conversion on it.  I don't ever want to know how well they do in an accident, but it keeps us legal and properly equipped.
B005AZ4M3Q|5|I have used other products in the past, but they never seem to totally get the smell out.  I have a female cat who is older and sometimes has accidents.  I just sprinkle some OMG on, leave it sit until it turns white then clean up and the smell is gone.
B006X8AJ86|5|Yes.
B003H2486K|5|Great little fuse panel.  I like the hot / switched feature.
B006E5VX0G|5|These pedal covers look amazing in the challenger. Really adds a nicer effect to the overall beauty of the challenger.
B0085FOZG2|5|These look and work great. Very tricky to wire and set up and the instructions didn't help. But I love them. Would recommend to anyone
B001CDAD2Y|4|Just getting it broken in. So far so good. Expect this performance tire to outperform my previous GT tire. Hope it's as good in the wet.
B002HVJ7G8|2|The catalog on  the web page said it would work for  what I needed it to fit. But it did not!  It was the wrong part. I need a 5 speed and it was a 4. I didn't have time to sent it back and had to tried to adapt it to make it work.  This broke the item voiding any chance of a refund.  Not happy!
B0110CO95S|5|Just a bunch of random stickers so wasn't expecting too much. But they're made real good and haven't had any problems with the stickers I've used so far. Great product!
B00GSAUHB8|5|I had tracked my package today with my shade it and I ordered  a book, when I got my package I said oh no where is my sun protector? I decided later to look at my book, when u open package I saw this little compact folded up round. My Shade it fit in the same box as book that's how compact it was! :) I opened it up and it was the size to fit in car windshield! :) I was not sure how to fold it up and I had read a review and it was explained! :) Thank you, I will test my shade it tomorrow. I am impressed so far! Thumbs up :)
B00Z8TGR4G|1|I've had better. It didn't fit my truck as described and had to be modified to fit. I would not buy again. Other products are just as good for less money. Plus, sending it back would be a pain after it was unboxed and awkwardly sized. Update as of 5-17-17, This has been on my tuck for about a year and a half.  I drive a work car and rarely drive my truck. I have put less than 5 thousand miles since I purchased this and my truck is always garaged.  With that being said, I took my truck in for an oil change and the tech told me the lights were out.  When I got home I checked and the whole right side does not work.  Considering the truck is always garage and has less than 5 thousand miles on it since I installed this, I think it was a complete waste of money.  As you can see from my initial post, I had to modify the mounts as not to drill holes in my truck, now it more of a liability than a safety benefit.  Don't waste your money on this junk.  Second one I've had, one from another vendor, both plugged into factory trailer plug, no alterations or modifications to the product at all and they fail.  No extreme weather, no rough driving, no alterations, never dropped or abused and still did not last more than an average person's 2 month driving habits.
B00VNPODMC|3|Loved it at first, but it faded really quickly. It's on.y been a few months and it's not sparkly at all any more. My daughter bought one from another company for less money and hers looks a lot better. Hers is exposed to more weather and is not garage kept like mine is either. Very disappointed.
B000FPYHOU|3|Light could be a tad brighter but it works.
B00YG8KRBY|5|My truck has been blowing hot air on the passenger side and sometimes on both sides, so I did some research and discovered that this was a common part to fail. Since I found it for a reasonable price, I decided to order it and give it a shot. So far, the passenger-side feels like fan-only air, but the driver's side is still ice cold. It seems that this part was not what I needed. Still, it apparently does what it's supposed to. I would say this item is a safe bet, when it comes to functionality. Just make sure this is the part you need.
B001NJJ94U|5|Amazing!!!
B000CIR49K|5|perfect
B00BG25CJ0|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B00WVJR0D8|5|Bought one of these for my 83 Nighthawk 650. First bulb I received was defective, but Opt-7 sent out a replacement and I had it in 3 days. Installation was a breeze. Plugged into the existing wiring harness, and the driver module was so small it fit easily even into the packed housing on the Honda.  The only trouble I had was getting the existing spring clamp under the heat sink/fan assembly on the LED, and that took maybe a minute.  Night and day difference from the old Halogen bulb. Great visibility in the daytime, and the road is far brighter at night. All the reflectors just POP! So impressed I went ahead and bought another one for 95 BMW R1100. Gonna upgrade my car too.
B008Q9X4EQ|1|Arrived completely opposite of what was described! Made of plastic, took over 2 months to arrive. Very disappointed! Not worth the money.
B0001MQ7E0|5|I bought this cooler as an added bonus for  when we go camping to keep our bread cool I kept it plugged in for the entire week our bread stayed nice and cool no mold I recommend this to anybody who needs additional things to stay cold I didn't use the warming benefits but I'm sure it works just as well recommend this to anyone
B0040CZ59A|5|Awesome
B00B29USC8|5|We love Weather Tech products.  The liner fit perfectly even though our Trax is a 2015.
B00BTSH53W|5|Excellent
B000NW8H3C|5|This was exactly what I needed for my car and in it's original packaging.
B00BZA260G|5|It  fits very well in my BMW. No more leaking borders.
B005TY2GQS|5|Can't beat this price.
B008FUVIAI|5|I was very impressed with the delivery of the product and the quality. Just like the one sold at the dealership but at a fraction of the cost, very high quality and it looks great on my truck, I definitely recommend it.
B00G9TKG8C|5|Fixed my inaccurate speedo and my fuel mileage went up.
B002G5DLMQ|5|This is a great quality decal, comes with very detailed instructions and I love the way it looks on my truck. Its been on my truck for at least 3 weeks and I've had no issued with it, the delivery was sooner than expected which surprised me and I'm a very satisfied customer that recommends it. I will continue to buy more decals from this place. Plus customer service it top of the line, their goal is customer satisfaction.
B00D29P5CO|1|Didn't fit over a 2014 Silverado headrest.
B000EQ8XMC|1|This part did NOT fit the automobile it was said to fit.  Spent a ton of money and because of the crummy AMZN return policy, I'm stuck with $150.00 of parts I can't do a thing with.
B00JJQ8PAI|5|Nice size sticker for the back car window.
B004BCCB0K|5|I needed to replace one of my headlight assemblies after catching a rock on my suburban.  I was disappointed when I checked on the price of these locally, then used from various places.  I was surprised to learn that not only did I get a great price on this, I could purchase the set for almost the same price.  Better yet, it included the lamps, which if purchased separately, would have covered the cost of the assembly.  So, basically the assemblies were free when you consider purchasing lamps.  They were OEM quality which is always a concern.  Installation would have been a breeze if I hadn't had a Ranch Hand grill guard on.  They still went in, but with a little extra time.  They arrived on time and the vendor was great.  I would purchase again.
B00B3YKUDY|5|Roomy and worked great. Love the expandable sides and the rain cover.
B0044A5ZK2|5|as always bently is the best manual to have. its my bible and i have a lot of different versions for all my vw audis. good price here for the 2 piece set!
B008G3KCHE|5|Product was as advertised. I installed them in my truck two days after receiving them. They work just fine.
B00G0P0GHQ|5|Super easy install. Had to use needle nose pliers to get the old one out, which was the hardest part...then just push the new one down (with a little effort) and screw the antenna in. All of 5 minutes! Toyota dealership said $100...so glad I decided to look elsewhere!
B00HZRZ8QW|5|Absolutely LOVE our Jeep Tire Cover !!  It looks like a real baseball....
B000HBM5TQ|1|I don't know if there was an issue at the factory, but my bottle arrived all but empty. It had maybe 1/4 of a teaspoon of product inside the bottle.
B00A3HSMQY|3|They arrived pretty quickly and I absolutely loved the print on them. Unfortunately I'm already seeing huge tears and it hasn't been more than 3 months using them. If they lasted a little longer I would have rated them at a 4 or 5.
B00KQ81M94|5|Great product! This puts the chamois king to shame
B0028R5ELI|5|awesome
B006U42QUC|1|Easily mounted but the nature of the device leaves a significant portion of the bottom of the window unprotected.  The unfurling process is remarkably simple but in the heated environment of a sundrenched car..the refolding is far from :automatic!  I've only had the device a few werks and have already had to get out of my vehicle and sit in the passenger seat to adjust the &#34;self folding accordion folds&#34; back into proper shape to snap the device back into its driving held position.<br />This is a great IDEA but falls far short..at least in the Tropical heat of Southeast Florida!
B000O5I65M|5|great no problems
B0081KAW18|5|Not cheap, but discounted organizer is well-made & practical . Prompt shipment.
B003TODXQW|5|this is one of those tools you don't realize you need until you buy it! I have been using the hell out of this- had a couple of issues at firs before fully reading the instructions but now it works great and with no issues! you really don't have to reef down on it- just a light crimp action and done!
B00NWQ9LG8|5|Loved it looked great on my atv
B002G1PC4U|5|Item worked as advertised.  Excellent product.
B00KTIY4ZA|5|as good as the factory one
B00CDAFT6K|5|Good sun shades especially in my left arm and face while drving in sunny SoCal
B0024ECBCA|5|We love the product, it fit and was easy to install. Thanks
B00KH9OMDA|2|Doesn't fit as expect... Cheap...
B00KGGTF9U|4|Works okay. Is not a perfect fit but fits well enough to protect the dash and help the interior cook less.  Also folds up nicely.  Just wish there was a more secure way to hang it.
B0009MZI4M|2|so so, ended up using a soldering iron and plastic, would not buy again
B00PP66AVC|5|Love these bungees that have a real clip.  They seem so much more secure than the other ones I've seen and the variety of sizes is super helpful.
B00JDSESFS|2|Was good cause it fit.
B00MAG6RMM|5|Got this to replace the anchor light on my boat.  The old light (non led) would draw my battery down so far by morning that I had to use the generator to start the boat.  These made such a difference, no generator and still close to 12 volts the next morning.  When coming into a bay with about 50 boats anchored at night my anchor light literally stands out.  I was so impressed that I bought the Yorkim festoon bulbs to replace the deck lighting.
B0074WPKAC|2|Noisy and not quite windy enough.
B00RN4TUMA|5|Perfect fit
B00NMZ4ODY|5|Fits perfectly in the engine, nothing wrong at all. It stopped all the oil from leaking everywhere on my driveway! I recommend it as it relieves the &#34;prelude curse&#34; so to speak.
B00GTIBULK|1|Sensor received was faulty. Had to return and purchase locally.
B00P1TDM28|5|Love it!  As soon as I started using the seat, my sciatica pain vanished!  I drive long distances for work and the seat definitely helped alot!
B00ORP122E|5|This jump starter kit is fantastic! I used it when I was camping (we'd left the lights on too long), and it worked like a charm! I would highly recommend this to anyone who plans to be out of range of at least a dozen other cars. They say good car ownership involves keeping jumper cables in the trunk, I say go one step further and get this kit. It is worth it!
B00NJ9MZH0|4|Much better than standard incandescent.
B00TBHXC4E|3|I don't really know how to review a product whose effects are supposed to be in the future. It's a protectant, right? How can I tell if it's working, especially in the short term? How can I tell even in the long term if I don't experiment and protect some parts of my car but not others?<br /><br />Despite my doubts, I applied it to half of the dashboard and some of the surrounding vinyl on my 6-month-old car. Following other  reviewers' suggestions, I applied it first to a paper towel and then to the dash. As promised, I didn't get any streaking. I wiped off all excess. Now, I can't tell the difference between the parts I applied it to and those I didn't. This is probably a good thing because, on one hand, the dash wasn't particularly dirty, and, on the other hand, I was really hoping that 303 wouldn't destroy my dashboard.<br /><br />Should this product get 5 stars because it didn't destroy my dashboard? No. Should it get 1 star because I can't tell whether it works or not? No. Three stars seems a little unfair -- I don't have any reason to be critical of the product -- but I don't have any evidence that it's actually *good*, so three stars it is.
B0093XLGVM|5|Good
B00BCRMA9Y|5|Fits my KIA Sportage perfectly. Have only had these on for 3 months but so far they're holding up great.
B00LBNL3VK|3|Seemed rather cheap and did not work as a replacement for dash lights. I've returned them.
B011P90I0G|5|Arrived early and is a great product
B005JU5YCU|5|easy to install
B00V42WB2I|5|Very nice quality, fast shipping
B00D7QHFMK|1|The product was split/broken.
B009KBUNX4|5|The grille looks good
B00XRKV4UK|5|Orignal good
B001GDJGJQ|5|I think my wife is still using it.
B00EXC1ZN2|4|Looks great on my truck
B0063L1JO6|1|So small it doesn't fit a mini water bottle without falling down and does not hold a cup of coffee
B00651BIKO|5|Great antenna. Easy installation. Reception is as good as the original.
B00M9WLAEM|5|Works great!  Just what I needed.
B003CGDPVK|5|fits perfect on my 01.
B00Z7KIZPA|4|This is well made and easy to install. I gave it 4 stars because it really only fits small purses. Many of the purses I own and use would not fit in this. However, a great idea and currently works with my summer bag.
B000M5YZKO|4|Item was as described.
B001QDHJW2|3|It's alright! It pass the test
B00IKQZLCI|5|The antenna fit my 2008 Dodge Ram 1500 perfectly.  It has multiple fittings for different automobiles.  Good quality just like OEM and price was good.  Took a while to get it but within a week after order.
B001HLIMD8|5|It is great for keeping the seat beat away from the neck, avoiding a rash or uncomfortable rubbing.  I take it everywhere with me because I know how uncomfortable I would be if I didn't have it.  I love the sheepskin and the price was definitely right.  It helps to keep the velcro closure away from the neck, but I am sure one would figure that out quickly enough.  It also slides easily up and down the belt.  Great convenience.
B0009IQXFO|5|Excellent product. I use this every week and my car looks great.
B0002UEN1A|5|I used the sealer for my atv muffler. It works great
B0009I5WPQ|1|wrong part
B001FF77W8|2|Did not fit my 2007 Mini Cooper S R56 Turbo even though Amazon's Garage said it did. Returned with no problem.
B00EQQIUGK|5|Excellent intake with an easy install. Had to drill two holes but other than that it's mostly self-explanatory. Minor noticeable performance improvement. Can really hear the Ir getting sucked in at high RPMs. Love the black aluminum tube. High quality. Would recommend to anyone looking to ditch that restrictive stock intake.
B0034NKDKC|3|Bigger then I was hoping for.
B000GZTLYA|5|Worked great on the hardtail!
B002G47GE6|5|perfect fit. looks just like the factory wiper blades
B00SLKE1Q0|5|thanks
B001UFXSBW|4|I installed these Hellwig 3520 on my Silverado K 1500.  If you put frame on jackstands and let suspention droop/hang. Then Iinstall. My kit was black so I painted them with ceramic engine piant. I have huge Cap on bed of truck and it's 12 years old and would sway bad around bends. Back end stays strong when get on throttle.  Highly recommend this if you haul or tow high profile anything.  I painted them chevy engine red.
B001EEC45A|3|This was made of good quality however the price is only for one seat cover. Also it does not cover the back of the seat.
B00LWQ1686|4|At first the buttons (especially the trunk at remote start) are very tough to press.  They loosen up after a while, though.  Furthermore, when I first installed my chip into it, none of the buttons would work at all.  I thought the battery was bad, so I replaced it, and still no luck.  I began to think it damaged my chip.  Eventually, though, after taking it apart for the millionth time I was able to bend the contacts outward (which I had tried previously to no avail) and since then it has worked perfectly.<br /><br />After all, it is a good product, and it shipped faster than expected (the original estimate was 1.5 months! Received in 1.5 weeks), so I give it four stars despite my initial frustration. Hope this helps!
B00S58V56W|5|Perfect fit, very easy to install.
B007EXOPCK|5|Exactly what I needed. Replaced original equipment. Easy to install. Shipped fast.
B00BF3A8YE|5|as described and on time.
B0060BTWZC|4|As with most touch-up paint that I've used, it doesn't match perfectly. That's probably because applying paint with a small brush is much different than the precision spray equipment and process used a the factory. Anyway, painting the chips and scratches makes them less noticeable. The container I received appeared fresh and was in good condition.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Fine
B00EKN8FXC|3|They produce a little more heat than I was expecting.  I wanted something that would be completely cool to the touch and these are not.  Much less heat compared to the incandescent bulbs though.
B00407TUQO|5|Used this on a Honda Odyssey front bumper after using the Dupli-Color CP199 adhesion promoter. It has been on two years, and there have been no issues of flaking through the years even with car washes.
B00RM327NG|4|it can hold a Large phone and holds it well, it fits very good in the vent without any damages or shoving,,
B0055MLNFE|5|Great product.
B005WG88KQ|5|So far it is working as advertised. It inflates my car's tries really fast. Haven't had any issue so far.
B000E0P6UK|5|Fits my 2015 Tacoma very well. Keeps the inside cool in the Georgia heat. Very pleased with this purchase
B00EIR7PWC|5|These are wonderful brighten up the fenders on my black Can Am
B00FTA1I6Q|5|as pictured and described
B000LG0BGQ|5|Work's great,had no trouble programming it and it took less than two minutes. Highly recommend this product.
B00EC0Y8TS|3|Fits well but the image is distorted around perimeter. Bummed about that
B00MDPI336|5|They look great and are durable.  Plus way less amp draw than standard lamps. Good buy.
B000182DS8|3|Not bad, not as sturdy as i would of liked and the edges are comming up a tad bit. But not too bad.
B000C9MEN0|5|Right fit, no noise, Steel pulley.
B00HRSPC2Y|5|Brightl little LEDs they do a great job
B000E0GBPO|5|Awesome product
B00G4L23PY|5|Work as expected.  Brighter light than my OEM bulbs, not sure if I can actually see further but things are more clear like road signs.<br /><br />I leave my lights on all the time so I'm a little worried about lifetime, but we'll see.  I've been running them for six months no w/ no issues, I'll report back when they burn out.  I drive about 40 minutes a day for 5 days a week.<br /><br />2008 Honda Ridgeline RTL
B006O0DXPO|5|Product fit great. Good quality.
B000TYOS3C|1|Looks good but doesn't fit correctly. Rubs the handle pretty hard. Makes it hard to open.
B001FCB4JS|5|I am using this on my Sailboat to seal the Windows.<br />Nicely package, quickly arrived and Amazing Quality.<br /><br />I would definitely buy it again
B00EVYBXZM|1|I felt the description of leather bags was a stretch.  Leather was thin and will not hold up if you are an active rider.
B0013V6M7U|5|Love this license plate frame.  However, make sure it fits the space on your car/truck where it is to be mounted.  Fit great on our truck, but know I have left a scratch on our car because the face of the club (bottom left) is a bit longer and I forced it on when I put the bottom screw in.
B007P8718O|5|Excellent
B007N3I4QY|5|It makes doing brakes so much easier.
B00XXNF8C6|5|easy to install, exact size didn't even need a clamp.
B00Y3H1VB8|3|I got them for my motor home, the will work very well at the rear but they may be difficult to use at the front of the vehicle.  This is not the fault of the jacks it is because of the way the front of the vehicle is arranged.  the jacks are fine as they are.
B007D3WL4A|5|A+
B000C34KSI|5|These are the best belts money can buy .... used for a LS1 application with a underdrive pully and a larger dr44 alternator. Worked flawlessly and quietly.
B00FOOUVTW|5|Low cost and easy to install
B00AKGBHSS|5|Exactly what I needed . Had a blowout on back trailer tire and it tore the one-pull apart. Fortunately I had installed stabilizer bars it was tight enough to hold jack leg up.
B009S4SYP2|5|This is an awesome tool I've needed for some time and the quality is great. Ty
B00A5AKLUE|4|perfectly matched the color
B00CIJPU74|5|great
B001KRKCGE|5|nice
B00C4XFMO0|5|I thought my AC went bad in my 2008 Prius. I was looking into changing the whole compressor in my car. When I called the dealership about my issue, they asked if I recharged the refrigerant. &#34;Uhhhh...no&#34;. They insisted that I try that first and I promptly did some research. I found out that the Prius needs pure refrigerant with no additives, otherwise it may be a costly fix. This product is indeed pure refrigerant.<br /><br />I purchased the charging hose in addition to the refrigerant, there is no way to add it otherwise. The hose should be in the &#34;Frequently Bought Together&#34; section for this item.<br /><br />1. Attach the hose to the can. Screw the end of the hose that has the valve and the piercing point (Should be obvious)<br />2. Attach the other end of the hose to the car ( See picture and look for red square) it is somewhere under the black panel. You will see a grey cap that you twist off. Then simply connect. Make sure the connection is secure and won't come off.<br />3. Turn on your car and make sure the A/C is running. The fan setting is not important. What is important, is that you have the temperature at a low setting. This is crucial for the refrigerant to flow from the can to your A/C system<br />4. Then open the valve on the hose above the can. All the way if you wish.<br />5. Check the meter for the proper level. When the valve is open and refrigerant is flowing, the meter will not give you an accurate reading. Close the valve and the dial will show you the accurate level. For a Prius the level should be between 198 to 228 psi<br />6. On the can, it says to rotate the can upside down and back to upright every 3 seconds. This is important! The first time I added refrigerant, I wasted some that was still in the can.<br />7. One you are done, unplug the hose from the car and you are done! Test the A/C to verify<br /><br />Make sure that you do not take the hose off the can unless you are sure the can is completely empty. These cans have a lot of pressure built up inside.a lot of pressure built up inside.
B008ND2RIE|1|Fits my camaro fine.  Put paid $10 more (each) for this unit because I was under the impression it was new.  Nope, reman!
B00YDL43A0|5|very satified with product and service
B00U8695HK|5|AWESOME!!! i love it and it actually works and fits perfectly! it gives the car a fresh clean feeling. if you like air fresheners don't use it together,cause it will eliminate any scent in its path! its works that good lol.
B00HFLA8Z4|1|Didn't fit threw it away.
B00DVVY7MM|5|what a great idea.  I buy them and give them to the women i know....daughters, girlfriend, friends, etc.
B0027XK788|1|Very cheep made!! The first one I installed for a client blue open in a wind storm and destroyed it ! Replaced or because it was at my shop when it happened!! The replacement leaked because they never welded two of the corners under the lid I fixed it in place so I didn't have to take it off the roof again!!
B004TR8F5C|5|Used this sway bar on a number of times and works very well. Wish there was a betyer way to dampen sqweeks
B00A14P49W|5|Great
B00DU6R7SE|5|Good
B007P73YD6|5|RECOMMENDED (EXCELENTE)
B000UOE1WY|5|Great product and easy transaction....Thanks
B000JFJLP6|4|Ok
B01290E5NG|5|Best downpipe gasket I have ever seen for my Subaru. Bought it with the Gruppe-S 3inch gasket. Really excellent quality, probably the best I have seen. Personally think they are better than the Grimmspeed gasket because of the price and looks pretty much the same if not better. The finish is really nicely polished and most gaskets are not. I would recommend it to all Subaru owners.
B003B2YMQW|1|Loudest break pads ever. Squeaked every time the brakes were applied. Replaced with NAPA pads, no more noise.
B00FFSD2X4|4|Wow...is all I can say. This was extremely brighter than I could imagine! The case seems sturdy and you do jave to assemble it yourself. The light is a bright I would say only 10-15 percent dimmer than law enforcement squad cars. I have have one complaint. The way the housing is doesn't let the light actually stick to the window cleanly. I cant use the suction cups at all. I did just drill the housing to my interior roof and it sits perfectly. I would post a video of it but it does it no justice at all. Definitely will be buying more!
B005BN46TM|5|Husband got his dream car and loves anything with corvette on it, he immediately put the seat belt covers in his car, really look great
B00029WSXQ|4|Works well  fits my needs
B00F09D9YA|5|Thanks
B0012P69TI|5|I BOUGH THIS WHIN I ORDERED A ACDELCO 15-80173 HEAT AND AC BLORER MOTOR GREAT FIT AND IT WAS HALF THE  PRICE , THEY WANTED AT MY LOCAL PARTS STORE.
B0013CRFDO|4|they are not as bright as I thought they would be.
B002OUDU74|4|Two of my clocks work fine. A third clock of this model had to be returned as it would stop working occasionally.
B00QQXFDUW|5|Ordered blue knob first and then this for my friend. Great new looks for your car and very solid material! One thing I should say is keep those extra screws and tool included to tighten it in handy since they tend to get loose
B005S5DDGK|5|very easy to install took 10 minutes
B002UC1AYQ|5|Perfect
B0031HEIDY|4|Good product and easily to instal once you figure how to open the headlight area, depend what car you have. This fit my Honda Accord perfect, just took longer time to open the area where I can unplugged the old one before put this in.
B007Y85XMG|4|Well built, quality part. Exactly what I needed.
B00C7I4XQ0|2|its ok. cant believe the size of it.  if i knew it was this small i would not have bought it
B00EZUL6ZY|5|Got it right away! Im satisfied by its quality and it really seems durable😊 it fits on my honda hrv 2016😊 my car is ready to any season😄
B000C541AI|4|Fit as required.
B004J6KP1A|5|Installed these on my brother's wife's H3 Hummer. Fit was OEM, no issues.
B000C9F5TU|4|Great product and fits perfect.
B007EEVMPW|5|One of my sons had me order this.  Whatever it went on, he had it repaired and going quickly.  Happy with the part.
B00DHQ0CGQ|5|Does a really good job of keeping my van cooler. I have a 2005 Dodge Caravan and it fits perfectly.I keep my front window cracked about an inch and that helps too.<br /><br />I like to sit in my car and eat lunch, and I leave this up while I do, and the car stays cool so I don't have to run the air conditioner.<br /><br />I've also used it in the back to cover groceries while I'm driving. It does help keep the cold things cold until I get home. (Don't stand it up, you won't be able to see out the back window! I just fold it horizontally and place it between the back seat and the groceries and pull it over the groceries.)
B004W5SGBO|4|great product
B0085KGOH0|5|great product for the price
B004W985DY|5|Makes my honda look alot better
B00JXW0S5S|3|The item is ok, I will like a little more yellow, but is ok.
B000CB05DO|5|good.havent tried it .
B000B5QFE4|5|They fit great and looked like factory finish.
B000NEAMBA|5|These filters fit great.
B00DLZSAAI|5|Many of these lights purchased and installed. They are very bright and draw little current. They appear well constructed. Producing pure white light that is focused per the degree array which are ordered.
B001O0BJUK|2|i have a problem with this coils when i used it 2 month today replace Spark plugs the coils rubber out from coils !
B008BMGQMU|5|Puts out a nice bright blue but not over the top. I was very pleased.
B00TNTUTJG|5|A green strobe is required safety equipment for vehicles serving the various mines in our area (used only while on mine property).  The light is basic and bright.  It has a variety of flash patterns, some likely more seizure inducing than others.  It seems to be built well.  If it holds up, we may order the amber version strobes for our on-road highway needs.
B0000AXNLT|5|Good product
B001CI7KRU|5|This product is well worth the money really makes your car standout. I would recommend it to my friend really, awesome I give it five hands downs.
B0036VRQ70|5|My Previa was developing signs of a head gasket going bad...moderate amounts of white exhaust in the morning that cleared up after a few minutes. I put the Bar's in, the symptoms disappeared and I have driven it over 5000 miles so far including a 3000 mile round trip. I hope it keeps going another 5000, at least. So far so good.
B0077FIKTE|5|Perfect fit
B00BYNJ6C0|5|The best shock money can buy, hands down. Had the stock bilsteins on my tundra with 160k+ miles. Decided to change them out, and they still had good pressure. I changed them anyways since I already had the old ones off. Great shock!
B0058WXNOK|2|Had to really work with it. Not perfect by any stretch.
B00P4S4HJI|3|Good product, easy to install, should provide plenty of protection from mud. HOWEVER, DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID, AND BUY THEM HERE, THEY ARE $20 CHEAPER ON THE ROCKBLOKZ WEBSITE.
B00KL3ALGO|1|These are terrible. They stick to the windows fine but did not block the sun at all. Don't waste your money. Seriously.
B00CQ8EBAO|4|Works great to keep the sun and elements off your Lowrance depthfinder. Fits tight but I would recommend that you remove them before trailering your boat anywhere as that's why I'm replacing one. Lost it on the road after about a year vso it may stay for awhile or it may not. Kinda pricey for what it is but they have the market to themselves, there is no generic replacement that I've seen yet.
B002R0LFKA|5|The light assembly, came in a timely manner. It looked and fit good. It matched the other light very well and the price was right.
B00BBM4FF2|1|Worked fine in testing @ 12V as soon as I installed on 24V system they all 3 failed in 3 min.
B00EIBEXL4|1|Incredibly brittle and soft material in soles which is kind of sad because I really like the design of the boots.<br />They're a product you get and you're immediately excited about when you do get em because they look kinda pretty but within a day the logos drop off... and you have a bit of cognitive dissonance.<br />Slowly you see the stitching start to come loose in a week and they already look a month old...<br />Within 2 weeks glue starts peeling off and the dissonance grows so you try gluing them.<br />3 weeks and there are holes in the soles. The waterproofing doesn't work and the soles kind of flop around as you walk...<br /><br />I would not recommend but hey if you buy them come back and review so that you too can stand and warn of these sad sad booties.
B005FKXRIC|1|They did not fit my trk...please update your vehicle chart!
B0002JN2EU|5|We have a small-engine mechanic who turned us onto SeaFoam motor treatment -- and against most gasoline preservatives and treatments. He said he'd drained, or seen inside, thousands of gasoline tanks, and the stuff sold as gasoline storage additives was often still there, sitting as gel on the bottom of the tank. Just gunk. He also said most brands of engine treatment weren't worth the money. However, he swore by SeaFoam, which I'd never tried at the time, and my experience since has proved him out. I've had many rough-running engines find their power and performance again, with nothing different, but a shot of SeaFoam in the gas tank (and the crankcase).<br /><br />We own a number of vehicles and equipment with small engines, from a compact backhoe, to a ride'em Husqvarna mower, weedwacker, chainsaw -- and on the larger size, a Honda SUV and Ford F150 pickup. All of them have benefited greatly from the regular use of SeaFoam.  However, when we're running the road vehicles a lot, especially in the summer, we go through gas and don't necessarily add SeaFoam with every fill. Recently, the Ford began to run rough. It stalled as I pulled up to corners and lights. In the past, that would have meant a mechanic and an expensive tune-up. All I did was go for a fill-up, and started by adding a full can of SeaFoam. Problem solved, just like that.<br /><br />The Terramite (made in the USA) backhoe is not used a lot -- and as with most motors, that is a problem. It's bad for an engine not to run it -- and especially, in most cases, for it to sit with gas in the tank. The  backhoe has a Kohler Command 25-horse gasoline engine that powers the hydraulics that run the wheels, steering, front-loader, and backhoe. I change the spark plugs each season, but it, like my Stihl chainsaw, and 6500 watt backup (gasoline) generator, and for that matter, all the small engines, can be hard to start after a hiatus. And even when they get going, they'll run rough. I used to drain the tanks frequently, then run them dry, then fill again before use, and hope for the best. But SeaFoam has changed all that. Throughout the summer, I can leave treated gas in the tank, and have little problems with starts or rough running.<br /><br />In the smaller equipment, I dose the gasoline with each fill (1 oz per gallon), as SeaFoam cleans both carburetors and full injection systems. It is good for gasoline and diesel engines. Added to your crankcase (1.5 oz per quart of oil), it cleans deposits and quiets noisy lifters.<br /><br />These days, most gasoline is mixed with ethanol and that's a bad thing for small engines. Ethanol goes hand in hand with water -- and as we all know, water in the gas is anathema to motors. Again, my small engine mechanic told me, 90% of the no-start problems he had to deal with were caused by ethanol-caused water in the fuel system. SeaFoam actually controls moisture and prevents this problem. It also de-ices and is anti-gel.<br /><br />In my opinion, when it comes to gasoline and diesel engines, large and small, SeaFoam is THE Silver Bullet. My equipment is often running, while my neighbors are running with theirs to the shop. I've told many about SeaFoam, but some people seem to want to do it the hard way.<br /><br />By the way, I also swear by PRI-G fuel additive for long-term gasoline storage. I keep 100 gallons of gas in tanks for emergency use. We are in a rural, wilderness area. I was introduced to that by survival expert, Steve Harris. He said he's had gasoline that was 10 years old still run equipment, because he'd added PRI-G to it (you can buy here on Amazon). Of course, you have to remember to add more PRI-G each year -- that's the catch.<br /><br />So our rule of thumb is, PRI-G for long term fuel storage -- and SeaFoam for month to month. Also -- this price is right! Of course, when you compare the cost of equipment breakdown, and having to take anything to a mechanic, this is almost free. However, apples to apples, this price ischeaper than Walmart -- and up to $4 cheaper per can than many auto supply and hardware stores.<br /><br />Can't say enough good things about this product! Highly recommended.pply and hardware stores.  Can't say enough good things about this product! Highly recommended.
B007S1919K|4|I love this stuff for my boat. I do question/wonder why on these the ratio is one ounce per every 3-6 gallons and on the 32 ounce bottle the ratio is one ounce per every 16 gallons... Things that make me go hmmmm....
B007TS6FNC|3|There was a bar that you use to keep tge garbage can from collapsing. ..it broke right away. Otherwise, it's a stylish way to keep your garbage off the floor of your car!
B001L9E3PM|5|The greatest oil for the E-TEC and the price is the lowest that can be found on the net.
B00Q6X8I4K|5|Had to replace a center cap on my 2007 Suburban.  Found a great deal on a set right here.  Now I have three spares that may come in handy.  They are exact replacements, great deal.
B000CJB1B6|5|Good product
B000UU40TW|5|Perfect fit.  Absolutely tailored to my vehicle, I'm very happy with this purchase.
B008B8JDDI|5|I like it very bright I love it
B000GKD5NI|3|Kind of makes it hard to see thru the window during the daylight. I'm not sure how it works at night time, yet. Haven't noticed a difference in reducing the heat inside the car after it's been sitting awhile
B00IMJT61A|5|Awesome all the way! Sounds great on my car!
B00EZUL6ZY|5|I liked them
B012LG24T0|5|I really like this backseat organizer. The white design on the side is pretty cute, and It has alot of pockets that's what i really want in an organizer. I had one before and it only has 2 pockets! and i hate it i couldn't fit all my stuff so i just gave it away and bought a new one. I bought this organizer because i have alot of things in the car and its very messy, alot of things everywhere, I'm very happy to finally have an organizer that can fit all my stuff. Soon i'm having a baby this will be very useful for us, i can just leave some of the baby stuff in the organizer. It can fit bottles, toys, etc. I'm very satisfied in this product. And this backseat organizer is super easy to install.<br /><br />I recieved this item for a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review
B00IK69IRC|5|Was told about this product by a leather repair man.  He gave me a small amount to use.  It works great!  I was so glad to see that Amazon carried since I could not find it in Northern California stores.
B000182EVY|5|fits perfict
B006B7YLZQ|5|Awesome replacement filter
B005HBBZEM|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B002TS2ZSG|5|Watch the video for installation and you'll love it too.
B0041G3G0U|5|I've got one on my F-150, and love it.  I use it more than the bed steps on the side of the truck bed.  I couldn't live without it.  If the tailgate opens, this step is down.  Mine has lasted 4 years and is still going strong.  So I bought this one for a friend as a Birthday gift.  He's a carpenter, and always getting in and out of the bed of his truck for tools.  He's a whole lot happier now.
B0014JUHA4|5|Looks great on my GL350
B004P1WMBU|5|Awesome top love it.Easy to install and easy to use.
B000F285EQ|2|The only reason I gave it two stars is for the material. It seems extremely durable. Now for the bad news- don't waist your money. A .05¢ ziptie will work better. This thing fits so loosely that its almost worthless.
B003SYNNOK|4|Great product.Fast shipping!
B004NABN5Y|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B002Z5VIS6|5|Great quality, stays secured with more than ample coverage!
B00OZVC2QK|5|Great product, & shipping.  I haven't tested yet off-road, but it really feels strong
B000GTVECS|2|The rule when buying things consists of 3 words, Good, Fast, Cheap. In most cases you can describe any product using only ONE of those words. This was cheap!  I got it for $60. I was soon reminded why I quit using Show Chrome products on previous bikes.<br /><br />If you installed it using existing holes, it would not conform to the windshield and left a 1 1/2&#34; gap between the center section and windshield. So I took it off and used a little heat to help mold the plastic backing to the windshield. Looked okay until I tried to insert the screws. The holes no longer lined up. Get out the drill and re-drill the plastic backing. That helped but I still had to use a little Velcro on the center section to hold it against the windshield.<br /><br />Oh wait, there's more. The outside edges have a reverse angle. This means the top edge sticks out past the windshield. I could only trim so much because of the stitching. I added a piece of Velcro on each side so the wind wouldn't pull it back.<br /><br />I will say, it does look good. It is unfortunate Show Chrome & Hopnel don't take the time to make things the way they should.<br /><br />I'm sure the frustration factor will get to me and I will replace it. But I needed something now for a long trip.
B00DRFSRIC|5|Great
B004RH99OK|4|Had to re-wire for the harness, but it worked fine,
B00H2UYXZY|5|Super nice. Recommend them.
B00S5R56B8|4|its worth it instead of paying a mechanic 60 bucks to look at your car and not do anything.<br />Buy it!!
B00063X7KG|5|This removes all the gunk you can't see
B00FKP9SU8|5|I like it
B00QAYN00W|5|Fit my 2016 cx5 great. Works just fine.
B00K86DB6G|5|Perfect fit for my 06 325i. Super easy to install. Just snaps in and stays put.
B00E3UM8A8|5|The most awesome pair of safety glasses, ever! I'm still using them. I wanted something different from everyone elses on the job. I got better and more stylish.
B0029TQDLA|2|Six months and we have to replace one since the plastic snapped due to heat.
B0042XORMI|4|good price and handy to have
B009X23B2U|1|The fit and finish is poor, in true Rugged Ridge stile. Overtime I say this is the last Rugged Ridge product, but this time it is. Shame on you, Rugged Ridge!!!! If I haven't drilled a hole in it, I would have returned it.
B00GXN28CG|1|Don't expect the &#34;heavy duty truck headers&#34; to be heavy, they're thinner than regular headers. They're also not black like the picture.
B0010T7Q7K|5|Great deal for nice replacement mirror fits perfect!
B00PFFG1EO|3|Works pretty good. I used dash commander for iPhone to see all the gauges and data. It's $10 and worth it. I bought a $250 dollar scanner to clear codes on my Ram and could have done it for $40 with this setup.
B001JSYMXI|5|runs good.
B002N4NV20|1|Do not buy from this seller.  Not genuine License2Bling. Frame is smaller than standard size plate.  Crystals are not as bling as the genuine ones.  Very disappointed.
B00LM4OQMG|5|Great
B00NOAJK1S|4|- Not &#34;extremely bright&#34;. Slightly, but noticeably less brighter than stock halogens. Probably good enough for DRL and street use, so it doesn't look to blinding to other drivers like other higher wattage and focused LED.<br />+ The color is almost completely white with a very small tint of blue.
B003C01FD6|5|great product
B001C6Q7US|5|Installed this actuator in my 2004 Chevrolet Silverado. Fixed the problem of intermittent heat coming out of the driver's side vents while operating the A/C. Worked perfectly! A/C is blowing nothing but cold air since I installed.
B0002JMSHW|5|Fit for a 2007 Chevy Malibu.
B004BTDOTK|5|Don't throw the box away until you drive your car in rain. the rubber slipped out of the holder in a thunder storm. I bought 2 pair of these PIAA blades and one of them was defective. One for my Infiniti & one for my Honda. They are fine blades.
B000N9RXOO|5|Perfect, just what I was looking for,  Marine supply stores usually don't carry them.
B0066RKVL4|3|I just noticed that my right side has broke today 6 months in. But its not a total loss, and its partially my fault for sometimes placing large drinks on that side. More solid than the OEM, not as solid as a actual cupholder.
B00CLVC1NK|5|It matched exactly and was easy to apply.  The only one problem was, I had to order more than what was needed.
B0000AY9W6|5|grate
B007CLM10M|5|Excellent product and great seller to work with!
B000FRS7DA|1|Received this 6 months ago. For the past 5 months been having problems, took to mechanic was told injector was bad must have lasted for about a month then quit.
B002Y2QD76|5|Fits and looks good.
B001MPY4ZO|5|Great product!
B0017T7WHW|3|This was showing rust the second day out of the box.
B000KK9Q5K|5|I was able to tell the difference whe I was riding my atv. Great product
B00CXYVKKA|3|This sticks on the outside of the car. Would have preferred it be an internal sticker so it doesn't get weathered. Do not remember seeing that in the description.
B005K08O6M|5|Easy to install and works perfectly.
B0068ESK1I|5|Nice. I loved the retainer clips. Very good quality<br />Made in usa
B00557YLO4|5|many cars, many horns, love my longhorns.. so fr no issue with the actual product.
B005O017J4|5|Work Great, can easily move the snowmobile around the garage.
B00AVND760|3|A fair product, but the mixing of colors is required to get the correct tint!
B00PQ63SZ2|3|I put them on a bike that weighs about 550 lbs, so it's heavy for clip ons and they moved around a lot at the place to set the bar angle, they are great for the price but be prepared to modify them
B00B36CL8Y|5|This paint works great ! Covers well !
B00S0UVNN0|1|Double checked that part was supposed to fit before ordering ... it didn't ... bearings were installed and both wheels collapsed when vehicle backed out of service bay.  Bearings ruined so unable to return.  Wasted time and money - very frustrating.
B002KOHIAE|3|Doesn't hold as much as I had hope for.
B0036NEUW2|5|got it on time (actually before estimated time) and the mats were as expected........thks.
B00480J4J6|3|It works so far. Good
B00864LJO8|4|Great fit, easy to install
B004GC6IJA|5|Brand new and a perfect fit. Cheap one day shipping

B00ZJ0HGVM|5|Very nice bag. No problems installing it on my Harley.
B005G5308S|4|as advertised,good value
B000C9LBHK|2|it s not a original ac delco product is made in mexico.
B000BTK8WA|5|LOVE THESE! I bought these to help with the load from towing a trailer this summer on a 2400 mile trip. The heavy duty springs i bought in conjunction with them broke in and started to sag slightly around 400 miles into the trip and i needed to air these up. With a touch of air they lifted the rear end back to a level ride height and improved handling drastically. Would definitely recommend these!
B00D2QL0DU|4|Work fine with no problems. Used it to transfer some water and had no problems with it. Hopefully, it will continue to perform as expected.<br />I'm not sure as to why the negative reviews on this because I'm seeing a top-notch product?
B00EPDLKH0|5|Now that this has been on my car for a few weeks I feel confident leaving a review. I LOVE this plate! I thought it would get scratched easily, but it still looks perfect. So happy with my decision to buy this.
B001O04880|5|The replacement product was as advertised.<br />I was able to replace the damaged tail light assembly easily.
B000C6ZDXQ|5|Perfect fit on my 05 MDX. True out of the box just as advertised with absolutely no pulsation. Best stock type replacement rotors you can buy at an incredible price.
B00CCSD6CW|1|Horrible lifted after it cooled down from heat gun
B000IY99U0|4|Just like factory OEM
B00LIC29H6|5|Great product, i use it in my audi a6
B00I7Z6UWC|5|Perfect fix
B00SVF0U6U|3|Doesn't seem to clean very well, leaves a residue unless you use one wipe per square foot pretty much.
B007KPU0PS|3|It works ok
B00JBGAR9I|4|Not bright green like in the picture, but worked great!
B00MVAU5DY|5|Had a mechanic install these parts, so far everything runs well.

B00J3JIHI6|5|The right part for the job thanks
B00BKO3Z8E|5|Perfect
B006WFJETA|5|Deanna wanted me to order it for her. I guess it was ok.
B000WJ6D78|5|Most comfortable grips that I have ever used.  They look good too.
B000N3DDI0|2|would not fit my 2004 polaris 500 .
B00AF3SS7O|5|These were as advertised.  They do have a bluish tint to the light.  They are much brighter than the factory bulbs.  I really like them and they are cheaper than the other brand.
B006FXHGH6|1|Does not apply well. Ended up throwing it out
B005EV28CS|4|Door Post fitted perfect
B008L0D2GA|5|I love this helmet. I wear it for hours at a time. The noise level is low and all the vents provide good airflow. Best helmet I have ever owned and will definitely buy ARAI again the quality is amazing. The finish is beautiful and the padding is top notch quality foam. It feels premium.
7138258879|5|Easy to apply.  Looks good on my car.  I put mine between rear tire and bottom of door.
B000KI7DZM|2|not too sure about this stuff. Do not have leather saddlebags on a motorcycle, maybe it is designed for outdoor abused leather.<br />it did not dress up my work boots like saddle soap or mink oil. It made vinyl car seats looks nice. Made my boots dull so I know I do not want on<br />my leather coat. this is something you may want to experiment with.
B005UYVIXO|5|Best buy. Great for epoxy everything.<br />I just recently added a chlorinator to my well and the well cap was not flat.<br />I filled voids with the epoxy and then belt sanded flush.<br />Then hole sawed a 1.5 inch hole, put a condom on a 1.5 inch pipe and sealed top side flipped it over and took a 1 inch tall crosscut of soda can over pipe threads from bottom then filled with 2 oz of jb weld.<br />Next day i unscrewed pipe threw away condom and was able to screw in my 1.5 x 1.25 reducing bushing.<br />On top of that i added a space nip a 4 way cross and then added my electrical air vent and peĺlet drop tube.
B00T6FPC76|5|Put them on in a matter of minutes great product
B000CMIG66|5|Good price quick delivery
B003LLQVIK|5|A great experience
B0002Q80RW|5|Needed this for my Harley Davidson GPS.  Works great.
B000BOC2E2|2|didn't work on my bike no matter what amount of it I put in. Clog the tire valve. Can't even air the tire properly now.
B00GRHRTEU|1|Came in damaged, because of urgency I ended going to Home Depot to buy parts to make it work. Would not recommend this junk to anyone. Worst product bough on Amazon so far.
B00OCDRB94|4|Works great only drawback on my tank is the screw on the clasp, it could be a bit longer
B000BZG8Z0|4|Excellent
B00FALW192|4|these products are great and work very well together as chemical guys designed them for. some people complain of chalkiness and i saw no result of that while using moisture control technique . the small bottles all though sample size dry up faster than expected inside the bottles but my fault i beleive for leaving them open between panel details on the vehicle. i fell the v32 didnt do a impressive job as the v34 did on heavy swirls so dont really see a need for the v32 unless your single stage paint is heavily oxidized as far as two stage i feel the v34 was all thats needed . although i did not use the v32 on hard paint
B00CQ8EBAO|4|Fit like a champ and hold on when driving down the road. You just have to make sure that they are attached tightly. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was the price. I thought it was a bit expensive for a piece of plastic.
B0091JCDVK|5|Love it
B000JWI8C6|4|Product is great! Install is not as easy as it seems. The exhaust was a pain in the rear (haha) and made it hard to loosen and tighten the bolts. Getting a torque wrench on the bolts near the exhaust was nearly impossibly. I had to darn near drop the entire exhaust system. Luckily for me, my Xterra is brand new. So it made it a lot easier. Good luck.
B002XM5G70|5|Everything was perfect with the quality and the customer service for this product.
B00V9IVIGW|5|Really sharp!
B00Y1Y79Q4|5|Great sweatshirt and received it quickly.  Very soft and the sleeves are long enough for me which is a plus!
B005F9IKUS|1|It stayed on for one week. I noticed it wasnt a tight fit so each night i tapped it into place.  After a week of my son driving and not tapping it firmly back on each day (who the heck wants to do that.), it had fallen off and is no where to be seen.
B000GZGUP8|5|Spark plugs work like a champ. My Nissan runs better and start quicker and has more power. I love them and will buy them again.
B000B8U61O|5|It was an exact fit for the vent I was replacing
B00TEAW5DM|5|AWSOME, Dropped right in. Bike runs like new again . If you looking for a Crab for your Breez grab this one.<br />Just like OEM.
B00063X38M|5|Was able to put back the weather stripping on my Toyota Sienna.
B00D9VB8WG|5|Went on perfectly! it has only been on for a day but after our drive it stayed on even on the freeway! Arrived exactly when the tracking said!
B00UIEZDVE|5|These mats are super good. They look good and feel good. I just love them. Keep the quality going.
B00DBFU6HI|5|Easy to install and look great.
B004RCUTGW|5|Perfect for the job.
B0023UO0NS|4|I would have liked a little bit of a stronger scent, but all-in-all, they work well.
B00WZXAAMS|5|Nobody could tell that the original hubcaps had been replaced. The installation was quick and easy. I'm very pleased with the purchase.
B00877SL2M|5|Excelente...
B000CPI5Z0|3|My catalytic converter broke down after I used this product. I don't know for sure if is the cause, so I give it 3 stars.
B009P9DHGQ|5|The product is as described and they are very easy to work with.<br />Thank you
B000BZEHZ8|5|easy to install cheaper than parts store
B003UNNQIC|5|Nice quality metal ends
B007HRN4N4|4|Worked out nicely on my 2005 Coachmen.  Fit perfectly and did not have to trim any excess at all.
B005U80C8C|5|Nice solid adapter
B001AJ48E4|4|What's there to say. It's a car net. This works with the both the MK5 GTI and MK5 Jetta (I own both models). It's a lot cheaper than the one made by VW. I had no problems with the clasps as other reviewer described.
B00INVF40E|5|Nice wire!
B000C8Z92Y|5|perfit fit
B0057FJMIO|1|Alternator for a Ford not my dodge avenger 3.5
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Easy to use, EASY TO READ, and accurate.  The price tag was a bonus too!<br /><br />I needed a gauge that I didn't need extra glasses to read and this gauge fit the bill.  The swivel head and release button also make it easy to operate.<br /><br />Thanks JACO!
B00011KM06|1|Wrong pad for my bulldog alarm
B00D1CQVIY|5|great
B000PUTZQ0|5|I ordered these boots for my husband to wear at our wedding. We had a biker theme and they were perfect. 4 months later now and they are holding up great and are now his everyday riding boots.
B010H34COO|5|They are a perfect fit and very easy to install. Not to mention, they work well.
B007WMY64A|1|Warning- this sticker will make you a victim faster than your angels can fly
B007Q92GT6|4|Good for the price.
B00ORZ8QYG|5|Love it
B003VC7138|5|fit jeep xj 98 like a glove. I love this mod. makes oil changes easy and no mess.
B00ENPPKV2|5|Great product.
B003066NIY|4|its okay but not what I have in mind.  its not a clip on, some wires needs work like connectors and stuff.
B007RA2YZ0|1|Photo on listing shows a wiper intended for a J-hook style arm. What I received is a top-lock connection mount. Obviously, not the same - see photo attached.
B00MNAEPV0|2|I bought these to replace incandescent bulbs in my motorcycles, and was sadly disappointed when I connected them. There is a slight difference in brightness from low to high, but not enough to get another drivers attention IMHO.<br />Might work for interior lights on an RV.<br />I'm returning them.
B00032K4VA|5|The plate does what it's supposed to do.. Mounts license plates. It can be improved though, as the plastic on the upper and lower parts of the middle portion are a bit flimsy and could be thicker.
B002DZJQ0A|5|It is really holding up well. The heat on the windshield hasn't affected it at all.
B004R3AKPG|5|This rack is just what I was looking for. It's reasonable in comparison to others, it was easy to install and it looks like it belongs. Doesn't stick up like many others that I've seen and it's quiet because of it's design. The diagrams and instructions are easy to understand and it took less than an hour from start to finish to install. I would suggest that you turn the special screw into the nut and then back it out before final assembly. It will align and make it easier during final installation. Great product!
B00J138G6W|3|The bracket does cover the area on the plate that says what state the license plate is from. I don't think this is good.
B00BGZ3FBO|5|Arrived on time and as pictured and described.*****
B0094JINKC|5|Excellent starter at a good price
B00042KGMG|4|very handy tool. had to jack up partially filled above ground pool to put heavier 4&#34; solid cement block pads under supports, as they cracked the 1.5&#34; pads originally used. worked great. I can see other uses for this jack.
B001V3131A|5|Love them!
B00CUNALVI|5|☆☆☆☆GREAT SELLER 100% RECOMMENDED☆☆☆☆
B000LS8ZRG|5|Really solid cable to use with padlocks. Some thief would have to work extra hard to cut this cable.
B000BOC8KU|2|Product description say it fits up to 2/0 guage battery cable, but the product package says 6 to 1ga cables. The part number on the package matches the product on the page.
B008QURFBS|1|So I finally got the correct covers sent to me but they still don't fit. The head rest supports are farther apart than the hole in the cover can open to accomodate. Too bad, these might have been good covers.
B00VKNU1PU|1|Description says one key fits both locks.  Not true. Received it and it has 2 separate keys. Now I've got to send it back and order from another vendor. Caused a delay in my project.
B00571APDE|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B0002JMLJC|5|It's a fuse
B00DLMHTGC|5|Love The Lights!  Easy to put in, Great customer service had a ballast go out and I was expedited a new one and had it within a few days!
B00DMHS1JK|5|Fit like a champ and work like a champ
B000C2Y41C|5|Nice sturdy hose. I had to trim about 2&#34; off this to fit my 1981 Caprice. Good purchase. Liking Amazon for auto parts these days. Fair prices. Prime membership means no shipping costs and generally no tax.  All good.
B00NQ8F2JW|1|Unsafe, does not perform to stated rating.<br /><br />In a 48v ups system the wire feels quite a lot lighter than 8 awg from the hardware store, but importantly, heats up rapidly under load where the store bought wire does not exhibit any temperature rise.<br /><br />Now I need to replace this portion of my build and source a bunch of new crimp connectors.
B00DD4CS4Q|5|Works good
B001J60YYQ|5|Delphi , always a great product and what a good price
B000C9DEFC|1|Doesn't look  like the original. Although it is of similar size,it looks like an aftermarket knock-off !  Also, and more importantly, the orifice tube won't slide far enough into it's tube to allow proper hose attachment! (Or am I missing something?).  Unless I'm able to make it work properly, it's going back!
B000CO7E6W|2|Junk. Perfect fit but cheaply made. Broke on install.
B004BHZR1A|5|67 other customer reviews have basically said everything that you need to know, I'm just here to post pictures of what the product actually looks like on my car (which if you're like me I'm sure is why a lot of you came to the reviews for anyway). tldr; It looks awesome.
B000VSY4HG|5|Used these on our travel trailer. All worked great, thanks
B00ZGH7FFK|4|This inner fender liner was a perfect match to my original 2005 lexus RX 330 splash shield, however, it came missing an additional bolt-on T-shaped stiffener that bolts to the liner and hangs directly in front of the front tire at the very bottom of the splash shield?  I did not know that it would not be included because this picture shows the (hidden when mounted) inside of the fender liner.  My issue was that when my liner was damaged that piece was unfortunately ripped off.
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Just wish there was a better way to indicate size.  This says Jumbo but it is not.  I have a 2013 Ford Escape...hardly a huge car, but this was too small.  Yes, yes, I should have measured, yada yada.....
B012BNZIZU|5|Lights look amazing and are really bright at night. No issues wirong and lit right up first try, figured id be the first to review. Definatelu would reccomend these over the cheaper knock offs
B00BMU9DOG|5|Arrived on time. I don't think it came with instructions but the 2 step process of putting them on is easy enough even for the non-mechanical person. The only thing I warn you about is make sure the air valve is lined up with the precut groove in the hubcap. Other than that, the material is a durable plastic. Its not chrome but it still pops. I have never had a hubcap wheel before this. So my only concern is how easy it was to install.  The lugnuts you see in the picture are pre-glued onto the rim. The ones that hold your wheel on are still underneath it. So I am giving it 5 stars on the assumption that the clips it uses to hold on to the wheel are stong enough to stay on at speed.
B004N5WHE0|5|Used on a motorcycle. Cleans well with no residue.
B00BG6IJA0|5|Worked fine for me, will update next use!
B00LG39X6W|5|These guys at cyber cave were outstanding! The kirby was as adorable as the picture, they gave me a mini one for practice which I also have on my car !  They even went and wrote thank you on the envelope!  This product is awesome!!  Thanks!
B0007XU4EC|5|Rv hot water heater works now
B001CG52QS|4|Great refrigerator magnet for The Eagles lover!
B000C7X25Q|1|it was a great fit
B000IYS26W|5|Have to have it programmed to exact vin and engine and mileage. Acdelco quality. Good price. Exact fit for my application.
B000FCF0DK|5|Fits my 2009 Yaris windshield perfectly. I bought another of HeatShield's sunshades for my 1991 Volvo 240 wagon which is also a perfect fit. It rolls up nicely and still holds it shape after months. The current summer weather in Houston, TX is 100 F+, and I have no covered parking at my new work location. I suffered for the first week, and it would take the entire duration of my 25 minute commute home to get the car's interior temperature to a reasonable level. Now it takes 5 minutes. Really impressed with HeatShield - highly recommended.
B00V2XHMBY|5|VERY bright and the construction is SOLID, I bought this with the factory wire kit / button, super easy install fit perfectly in my 2005-F250 bumper and if anything ever happened to this light I will buy it again its worked flawlessly no need to spend 3 times more on a different brand this little guy packs a punch and is SOLID!
B0063J42C4|5|Thanks so much. Your sale arrived just as promised. A+
B00405CD2E|5|Just what I needed
B000FQ7IQI|1|wrong part. Its the inner seal.
B00NIZZZ5Y|5|Perfect fit.
B00MXGFLLM|5|Awesome padded seat covers, easy to put on except have  to  remove rear seat in 2014 Silverado to back cover on.  Purple color is brighter more like a plum I live them
B0002L2MMG|5|Awsome
B00PUOQRK8|5|I've been using this product for over a few weeks and I have to say, I absolutely love it. It fits right in my honda civic and It works fantastically. I was waiting to test the product out for longer than a week to see how well it worked and thus far I have no concerns and I am completely satisfied. :)
B00YI3IGA6|5|I purchased the ShadeSox Universal Fit Car Side Window Baby Sun Shade to put on my husbands back windows to protect our two boys from the hot sun. They were super simple to install, simply grab the open end and stretch over the window of the open door then with both hands pull down to cover entire window. They help cut down the sun exposer much better than the film window attachments, because they actually provide two layers of cover one on each side of the window. It gets very hot in my husbands car because it is a dark color with black leather seats. These shades help to reduce the heat in the car when it is left in the parking lot while he is at work as well. By moving one to the drives window when he gets out to park the car it keeps his seat from being hot when he gets back in and cuts the inside temperature of the car by a least 10-15 degrees. I love the fact that my 2 year old cannot pull them off the window, like he does with the film applicants. Overall I am highly impressed with the ShadeSox Baby Sun Shade, and would recommend it to anyone with kids or anyone wanting to help keep the inside of the car cool on a hot day.<br /><br />I received this product at a promotional discount in order to test the item and leave an honest and unbiased review.
B000GSJQCO|5|Great item, just as advertised.
B008YK4XLK|5|Good purchase.
B000E0IDT6|5|these are pretty nice.
B000CIJ4AM|1|It didn't work I still have not received my refund
B000BRJVUW|3|Nice but not for heavy duty applications
B0007N5758|5|Cleans under nails well without scratching.
B00II5YADC|5|Works great!
B0058WXNOK|3|This order was what I expected. It did not work out as well for me however. I think I waited too long  before getting it though (rips and holes were quite large) So good product, do not wait to get this. If the rips and holes are on the big side it will not work the way you expect it too.
B00GEV9PP0|5|Good.
B00OTMHO2C|1|LOUD! also very low. Good material but POOR fit due to lousy welding jig I would guess.I had to &#34;section&#34; and reweld it to get it even close to stock pipe height.
B000E9C21M|5|Nice color....Not to dark !
B007AHH7CK|5|Absolutely enjoy riding at night with the led lights  I have installed. Installation  was very easy and the the fit and finish is excellent!!!
B0029EJYM0|3|Economical but not an exact fit.
B004HCOE8Q|5|Very good
B00KWMO7V4|5|Excellent buy. What a deal!!
B001DMFPQ8|5|Came in earlier than promised, was exactly what we needed, easy to follow instructions, thanks
B00DD1E716|4|Good not great.  They are actually more comfortable when you have the logo against your chest rather than showing outward.  Which sorta defeats the purpose of having the logo.
B0012TZ04E|5|Works with his costume.
B0055B0XA6|5|works great for my 2004 pontiac grand prix gt1
B0071J166A|5|Love this. Made my Tacoma stand out
B00BCRM9YA|3|for the price. not bad
B0055PD1H4|5|The black plastic liner in my trunk had gone all cloudy and I'm getting ready to trade the car (9 years old) so I thought I'd try this. My jaw dropped. Results were instantaneous--the white, cloudy plastic panels returned to like-new appearance as soon as I started wiping this stuff on them. Hopefully the effect is lasting but if it's not, I'll just apply another couple of gobs the day before I get rid of the car and it'll look great. Again, this stuff is astonishing.
B00W8DBZQU|5|These floor mats fit our 2015 Renegade perfectly!
B0012TRJBQ|5|Great tool kit, fits almost everything on my bike except for rear axle nuts.  T handle is fast and easy to use.
B00008RW9V|5|This is something everyone needs for their interior.  I can't stand having dust on my dashboard or console, or even the top of the steering wheel, this takes all of that out of the equation.  A quick swipe of the duster over the hard / soft surfaces of your car and it's completely dust-free.  Definitely worth every penny.  I bought 2 - one for my Mom's car and one for mine.  The price is great, you can sometimes find these in AutoZone or PepBoys but it's going to cost you almost double what Amazon is charging.  After a dusting session, just give it a vigorous shake out your window and slip it back in the case they provide, and you're good to go.
B00ELASYIA|5|I haven't needed to use these jumper cables yet but they appear to be well-made with no indication that they will not do the job when called upon..  The cables come with a decent storage bag and a set of gloves.
B00LLJ6COW|5|Just like it shows. Went on easy, and stays on.
B00R0WMO96|1|Will not stick to my Audi.  Not sure why but keeps failing off.
B002PQQASI|5|Fit perfectly fine , just like the original , but cheaper,  I recommend this one to anyone
B009TAVUA6|5|Great trail computer. Relatively easy installation.  Had to remove the front brake calipers and drill a hole in them, but the entire process only took about 35 minutes.
B00EC2CN2K|5|Very well made product.
B000F5JM0O|5|Used this to remove and install the dreaded leaking radiator hose on my 2008 Grand Caravan.  Makes the job a whole lot easier.
B00HNP91VO|5|Don't judge it by the size best bar for your money
B00IOBNR1G|1|Didn't fit that good
B001DHEBLI|5|A most excellent product in all respects. Exactly what is needed for the application and the named automobile. Quality at an affordable price.
B00GX4Y9AY|1|Stopped working after about 4 month, seller is trying to make me buy another one instead.
B000BYGD5Q|5|Fit perfectly great price
B000GU3KHO|5|XL covers my Yamaha 650cc Cruiser leaving about 2-3 inches of tire exposed. Hopefully this helps your sizing
B000GZV8GO|5|Yuasa.....I've depended upon them for years; fine product
B00L2PRN2K|5|A great performance carb for the 80cc mega motor defiantly recommend this!
B001V8U12M|4|Excellent addition to the jacks as this will make using them much easier.
B00YEC6TFK|5|Perfect fit good quality good price .
B001CS92IU|5|Very easy, not cheap!
B000C34KSS|5|Fits my 2010 Dodge Ram Hemi perfectly, and completely quieted the squeal. Great purchase I would do it again.
B00LP3D3RS|5|Very nice leather seats
B0010E00T6|5|Got 2 years out of this before the dealership wanted $60 to install a new one.
B00JHK81X2|1|Not worth it
B00O2JUI6G|5|Exactly as described and looks great! Very happy with this purchase.
B004ZF35GM|5|Cool lights, and I liked the product!!! It was just a surprise of the briefcase because it looks larger in the photo, but when I received it, the briefcase was small, but cool!
B00EOTTYG4|5|perfect. exactly as pictured
B00LMY1YJ4|5|Husband installed in minutes!
B00IIVEVQW|5|Great buy, fits great, and easy install.  Amazing Amazon service as always.
B00K85BPB0|3|These have a very strong odor that does not smell very pleasing.
B000WK6ULQ|5|A+
B0071I3OWA|5|Good replacement piece
B001EYYRDW|5|My trunk kept falling down when I was trying to get groceries or something else out.  This has saved the back of my head for sure!  Now it's harder to close the trunk than it is to open it.  Good sturdy strongarms for sure.  It's easier to replace when it's hot.
B003WHDDKM|5|Good glasses, have no troubles with them while riding.  Fit great.
B00MUF1APW|5|Perfect fit on my 2015 Silverado Reverse Lights... Got these because there is plenty of room for the reflector led end of the bulb
B005ONBXB8|5|Excellent!!! Just got it installed!!! Im very happy with my purchase it fit my 2001 toyota sequoia like a glove!!
B00RW5K37Q|5|Beautiful
B000BUU5Y0|5|Great ! ! !
B004I11UUG|5|Very suitable
B0039VGCUE|4|Excellent ,, on the same day ,,, no problems
B0040MF13K|5|I love my Tinkerbell covers. They look great.!!!!!
B00YIA2VH8|5|IT WORK'S JUST FINE. ALSO GOT A LOT OF LOOKS AT THE LOCAL MOVIE HOUSE IN OAK CREEK WISCONSIN.
B00B8BCCJ2|1|Item pat numbers are incorrect.  Not for GM SUV as part numbers indicate;  OEM #15196385, Partslink #GM3010420 are NOT FOR THIS ITEM.
B00QUARWZ0|5|Fit great
B00JYPUWWI|4|ok
B00K7X92HM|4|Tough to get on, but it is pretty durable once you overcome the initial obstacle!
B0087XOTWW|4|swapped out my cars larger interior lights for these and so far so good after a couple months.
B00HFLH5LE|4|Decent but not great (good enough for an 18 year old Explorer with 215K miles) Occasionally one of the directions doesn't work. when that happens, tap it to another direction then back and it will work. Otherwise fits and looks like factory. Next time I'll spend the money on factory. Trying to save a buck often ends in compromise.
B003E1IQBM|5|Excellent product! Works very well and was easy to install.
B00D5V6UNC|5|Thank you works great
B003ZWJEYI|5|if it fits it's golden.And it does thanks to your system
B003ZWC6RA|5|thanks to your fool proof system they fit.
B00R867GGK|5|fits perfect and was in perfect condition
B00GYHKQ0M|4|Good
B00A6BVB74|5|Couldn't be better.  The FR-S is not exactly known for its window tinting...My car is probably 20 degrees cooler after sitting in the Texas sun while I'm at work.  I'm sure my dash is feeling the relief, not to mention my hands on a black steering wheel!
B00199F2WW|5|Haven't tried it yet but I think this the perfect product for my car.
B002ZTNWC2|4|fast service, great price
B000IHUQ5E|5|Perfect tool
B005RA6W8W|5|Fits 2010 R1200RT factory bags -- nice quality
B000X25LB8|4|Bought this for my wife's car and she was elated....and after only a few weeks in the trunk it has long since paid for itself....several spilled items were totally captured by the WeatherTech liner.
B001N0E188|5|Beautiful condition and appearance. This will more than adequately replace the one I lost. I may need to buy 2 more.
B001KO3426|5|Does exactly what it is supposed to very well.  No complaints.
B00IO98DIA|5|Perfect fit
B00ANBMRMK|5|For me, every penny I paid for the WeatherTech  liner was a penny well invested.  This liner are more expensive than many other, but they adjust perfectly to our minivan.  I don't have to worry about the liner steping between my foot and the gas pedal, etc.  Like other reviews said, it's a little annoying to remove the liner every time you want to open the floor store, but it doesn't take more than half a minute to take it off
B0007VM3EI|2|I did not receive the bracket in the image, it was very different. And did not match up to my 2000 Toyota Tacoma as it was supposed to.
B0081OSRQQ|4|Works good  smaller then I suspected
B000FQ7TMG|5|good
B0108U7XVA|3|First off, would it kill people to add what they bought the bulbs for? Here, let me try it. I bought them for a 1991 Toyota Pickup. Nope. Still alive. I found these to be no brighter than a filament bulb. They will require resistors, as the rear turn signals flash too fast now. They won't fit in my front turn signals; the base of them was too broad to fit into the socket. I may just go back to normal bulbs for normal people.
B000C9SD6W|5|Muy buen producto
B002P8J26I|5|This mirror is a perfect fit and works great. In fact the motor that powers this mirror is really quiet. I was able to install it in less that five minutes. Great deal!!!!!
B00ZG6JKUO|4|Great stickers. Nice quality and selection.
B00WHHAFPE|5|Item as described at a great price
B0016LE80K|1|Good
B00E5PK8TE|5|So far it does what it says. Perfect size and made in the U S A
B005M2259A|2|No good for me.  My 2004 CLK320 has a rubber molding that goes around the heated mirror.  I measured the visible part of my mirror and it was 6-11/16 (from the inside edge of the rubber molding) so I thought this was going to be the right one based on the description. Of course, I knew this one was not heated when I ordered it, but I expected it to be the same outside dimensions as the OEM so that I could slip it into the rubber molding, then glue it onto the backing plate using either the adhesive pads they sent me, or some 3M automotive double-sided tape if I needed something thicker (the heated mirror that I broke is twice as thick as the unheated mirror).  I was also ready to put a small bead of glue all the way around the back side of the rubber molding to seal it from rain and dust.<br /><br />But, no go.  This mirror glass is smaller than the OEM glass.  It's designed to be glued onto the OEM mirror I guess, unsealed, with the edges visible, and a thin airspace between the old mirror and the new mirror.  Since my OEM mirror glass was smashed, this wasn't an option for me.  Not sure I'd want to just glue it on there anyway--you'll have sharp edges all the way around because the glass edge is not beveled or polished.  Ended up ordering a new heated mirror assembly (glass, molding, and backing plate) for $75 from an online parts dealer. Live and learn.<br /><br />If you want to search the web for the heated mirror assembly, that MB part no. is 209-810-01-21.  If you want to get the &#34;auto dim&#34; feature, that mirror assembly costs three times as much, and that part no. is 230-810-05-21.
B00BG8XUIO|5|great fit no issues, also no gap between hood and shade easy to install/
B000FW7V50|4|Thanks for not charging me a list price of $150.93 amazon. What is that? I do like the product however.
B000EQ6446|5|looks like original and fits perfectly
B000F19XDE|4|It does what it suppose to do, and the color was a good match.
B000CISG9W|5|A perfect fit and it keeps the black interior much cooler when I remember to put it in.  Something that is infinitely better this summer.
B00480N0SC|3|Don't expect anything even remotely like HID/Xenon look.  They are brighter thanks stock, but not noticeably &#34;whiter&#34;.
B00TUNSOMO|4|I used this wax on my 14’ sunfish.  This is the safest boat to experiment on it does not have the expensive fancy paint and it is the one that gets the most scuffed up.  Not that I ever hit anything.  No. No. No.  Nope.<br /><br />This wax worked as well as the fancy pants more expensive ones that I get after everyone else has waxed their fancy pants boats.
B001H1I40O|5|This fit perfectly for my 2013 Edge after I realized this piece dissapeared at the car wash! Easy to snap on, anyone can do it!
B000C5K5Q2|5|Direct fit for my 1997 Altima.  I bought mine used from Amazon warehouse deals. Half the price and looks new. The difference from new and used is the box. Amazon warehouse deals shipped it to me with no box. No box, looks new and half the price. You do the math.<br /><br />Excellent quality. To me, it is better than OEM quality
B00IS93BCE|5|installed very easy looks great arrived sooner than expected would definitely recommend
B00429NKWK|5|A bit of work involved, be careful with the clear coat portion of the steps as any streaks will dry and show, but otherwise VERY happy with this product, my headlights look awesome now!
B00TD8ELDW|5|Ohhhhkayyy.
B00F4JOOG8|5|LOVE it!! It is so cool.  Applied easily
B002OPOAR8|5|Good blade and heavy duty.  Better quality than the original.
B003A8D6YG|5|Love this thing. Wish I had found it sooner.
B000CMF31M|5|seem ok.haven't broken yet
B00CLBTHJ6|5|Fits and looks great in my car & also shipping was fast , I love the carbon fiber look it has in it!
B00ABRFG1U|5|I think this is an awesome product I can fit much more in my glove box now
B00UA84V70|1|Very poor quality
B00WBFYZO4|5|Good!
B00BD9HYJW|4|good, but i need to clue some parts...
B003VGM8K0|4|looks like the OEM and bolts right up. When you turn on the lights the pair look different. This light is dimmer and the lens pattern is different than the original. By day it's fine at night they don't match. Still it's a good price, better than $160. from the factory. I guess I can live with it not matching at night.
B0111JL5F2|5|A+++
B007IDI3E2|5|Working great now.  Never know what type of metal these are made of.  Time will tell
B002P8HJ0E|5|Very good item, I'm so happy with it
B00HQYTUYA|3|Amazon is more at fault with the problem I had with these, they sent me 2 of them that were the same product number but made of completely different material.  One was very soft and fluffy the other very thin more like a sheep skin.  Returned the thin one  hoping to get the same thicker fluffy one I had described in the remarks section instead got 2 of the thin crummy ones back.  They then billed me for the extra one they sent me.  Which I had just thrown in the closet.  So I kept the nice one and one of the crummy thin cheap ones.  So BEWARE..
B00DBENCZC|3|Good
B000N2WAMQ|5|very good value.
B00WFC7QYY|5|These goggles look great for the cafe style. They fit well, and I use them at night they have great visibility, but if your used to wearing sun glasses while riding your motorcycle. You will notice that there is less peripheral view, but they still work well just means you need to look a little more over your shoulder. I get compliments on my goggles and friends ask where they can get a pair.
B009DK0SGY|4|Excellent service and part fit right in. Appreciated the quick delivery and quality of the part. Thank you.
B000NMDFNY|1|Before I say anything else let me start by saying that I've been hand detailing my car for 5 years now- and have had my share of good times and bad, as well as good products and bad ones.<br /><br />Tonight was bad....I mean BAD.<br /><br />The first time I purchased and used this compound it was great- with some elbow grease and patience I could easily buff out all kinds of little scratches and paint marks from neighbors dinging my dark blue car. But now on my second bottle this stuff is complete cr@p! I've never hated a car product so much until today- I worked for a good 10 minutes on 1 spot to no avail- actually, it made it worse! It added a whole new pattern of scratches around the one scratch. Killed me inside a little bit, seriously I was ready to throw in the towel and call it a night.<br /><br />The only salvation out of this particular detail routine was the polish I had on hand from Meguiar's- it took away all the crappy little scratch marks the compound left. I nearly cried from relief- the paint was back to its former self- granted with a bit more wear, but the shine was still deep. If I had taken a picture I would have posted it- but I honestly had no idea that the polish would knock out those scratches.-didn't expect it to.<br /><br />I have no idea what happened with this compound. I'm utterly pissed about it though. What once worked so well is now nearly useless- I use it to brighten up and buff my headlights, and did tonight as well, but even that didn't come out as well as it used to.<br />Maybe this is a new formula. I don't know- I used the exact same towels/cloths I always did, and always with a bucket of water nearby- but this stuff did nothing but make my paint worse. I think I'll be staying away from trying to buff out my own scratches for a while- it darn near gives me carpel tunnel every time anyways. If you want to give this a go I'd say try it with an electric buffer instead- maybe that will help. But as for hand buffing, don't come near this stuff.this stuff.
B000EFOZEI|5|Transformed my car! Looks beautiful!
B00AG1OKR2|5|Haven't installed it yet, but the quality seems really good.
B002XUXUTS|5|I would give this a 5 Star based on the simplicity, installation, and price point. You can't compare this to an OEM install that you may typically find on new cars. This item has just two sensors and can easily be removed with no holes to your bumper. An OEM install would require 4-5 sensors and holes in your bumper.<br /><br />The Hopkins gives enough coverage to monitor any obstacles directly behind your car. It will not pick up any obstacles that are on the far corners of your bumper. The sensors can be adjusted depending on the heigh and angle of your license plate.<br /><br />I installed this on a 2013 Tacoma 4 door long bed. Initially, the wiring was not long enough to reach from the rear license plate to the cabin. I called the company and they sent me the extension at no charge. It took me a few hours to install as I routed the wires tightly underneath the truck.<br /><br />I am happy I installed the back up sensors. It only costed me about $35 and a few hours of work. The installation can be removed easily if necessary in the future. Due to the fact that the truck is very long, it makes it much easier backing out of parking lots and tight spaces. I am much more comfortable lending my truck out to family and friends with the added protection.<br /><br />The sensors give off 1 beep when you put the car in reverse, to notify you that the sensor is active.
B004OE46FS|1|I think these filters may be knockoffs
B008EEYXIO|1|It's a good part but amazon lists this as compatible with with the WRX STI. It is NOT compatible with the ej257 motor/ wrx sti from any year!
B004F63RYQ|5|Love this! It keeps all kinds of stuff for being all over suv. I have dvd's, kleenex, remote, pens, and whatever else my 5 yr old tosses in.
B00Y5FNVV6|5|really good item
B0094MECXQ|2|Not what I expected poor
B000C5BSS6|5|part was an oem replacement, fit perfectly as expected. shipped in a timely manner.
B00JFDHQMS|5|Perfect fit. use a little super glue and it won't go anywhere. I had to buy paint to match my car color
B00DD9LC0C|4|Perfect match for the faulty one on my 2001 BMW x5. Working as expected.
B0012TWPPQ|5|THE stuff for plastics. Period.
B001879CUS|4|ok
B000L9AD2K|5|Its great, works well and easy to use and carry around. Very nice little machine to have.
B00KUL9XSO|3|Installation was fine and performance is good but they squeak when taking off from a stop.
B003BDMPMO|3|Nice well drawn easy to read color print
B010TRL3JU|5|Working as described.
B00192KZQ2|5|The Clear Sewer Hose works good, tell you how the sewer flows.
B0046ID5EK|5|Great price and quality product.
B00KJW97DA|5|Cool keychain.
B00BSY719A|5|Received earlier than expected and worked to pull my 1997 trailblazer primary
B00823QIK8|5|Fits my 2013 Lincoln MKX like a glove. The only issue I have is rolling it back up after use as it is fairly large and needs to be rolled fairly compact in order to secure the velcro closure strap, but I don't mind one bit since it does such an amazing job of keeping the Florida heat from turning my car into a sweat box and ruining the interior in the process!  Very satisfied!
B00RLE6HBY|5|These came out great. Except for one minor issue, the license plate bulb broke while I was trying to fix the connection. It really sucks that I have to replace it already.
B000JFNAAS|5|Great product
B004J0V8JO|4|Fit 1999 Vitara well, good value, quality seems ok and similar to original radiator.  Only problem on the unit I received was that the transmission cooling line hose fitting on the passenger side connection was a 90 degree connection that should have been straight.  Picture shown is correct in that one fitting is 90 degree and one fitting is straight.  The straight hose fitting off the bad OEM radiator had a finer thread and could not be used.  I could not get a correct fitting at Advance Auto nor NAPA, so I bought an 18-inch length of hose and splice fitting so I could loop the transmission cooling hose and connect to the 90 degree fitting on the radiator.  Added about $20 worth of parts and some aggravation.  I did not contact vendor on this issue as I was mid-way into the repair by the time I realized the problem and had to get the Vitara working, just dealt with it.
B00ZXO71XM|5|It is as advertised and worked well so far helping redirect my winch line to clean up some widow makers.
B00FYCN8BM|5|Perfect fit!
B00NY7QPVE|5|Good
B012DJBIB0|1|Unable to rate yet
B000C9HWQE|5|Great price. Exact fit. Quick shipping. Can't go wrong with acdelco
B000VKRQ7Y|5|Good Product - Fast shipping!
B00TJ266YE|5|Fits perfect. Looks great
B000KL2ZHU|5|It did what it is supposed to .<br />No complaints.
B00Y9LPP4W|5|These microfiber wash mitts have quickly become one of my favorite cleaning tools. They're amazing for cleaning cars but also for a variety of other tasks, such as washing down and polishing hardwood floors by hand. I know, who does that? But I do, I'm old fashioned and when I clean, my house glistens! The dry microfiber also works perfectly for grabbing dust off of electronics- think your big screen tv that's so hard to keep clean.<br /><br />I love that they can be used both wet and dry. The wet mitts are wildly absorbent and so super soft that they'll never scratch or harm whatever item you're cleaning. Plus the dry microfiber is great at trapping little dust particles and will remove dirt from most surfaces without damaging the finish or leaving lint or streaks. I also like that the company offers a 100% money back guarantee.<br /><br />My personal experience with these was perfect. They give you amazing control while cleaning and do a fantastic job both wet and dry.<br /><br />I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.
B00WGPFK4I|1|Have noticed NO difference at all.  It lights up and looks pretty, however I have noticed absolutely no difference before and after having used.
B001C3XC86|4|Great product but had to do some reconfiguration to fit my Harley
B00AMNKULO|5|Glad to have found this.  Wife's Highlander experienced increase intensity of front end vibration just like ABS engaging with every press of brake pedal.  Took awhile to find that even slight warp of rotors (undetectable by eye) can cause this.  Once I replaced both front rotors with these, problem gone.  Very reasonable price and 1 hour of time to replace.  Great savings over dealer or repair shop.
B004SFKJIQ|4|nice thing
B00KLKMXQS|5|Fast shipping. ...great!!!
B00O2I5FXI|4|this size does not get in way of sun visor.  i would like a little more blue tint, and the broadway does not seem to come off easily.
B000DINKPQ|5|On all my helmets!
B00877TP4K|1|Holes not drilled to correct size. Ended up breaking the entire latch trying to get the little spring through it
B004Q3MDIY|5|Awesome product.
B000C9TCH6|5|I buy these every year and they work wonderfully
B00YME6LU8|5|This silicone case fit great, and looks great too!!!  It slipped on very easily in aboout 10 seconds.<br />I chose this one because the black & white contrast looks great, the white  ring on the back surrounds an opening which lets the vehicle logo on your remote show.<br /><br />I bought two and woould definately get another, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B001JSPPMA|5|Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised. Good quality.
B001THQP84|5|Bought these to string up lights in my tent.  They do the trick.
B00GJKOBX2|4|Lights are awesome, very bright.  I mounted 2 on the bow of my boat for navigation at night and they work great.  The reason for 4 stars is I ordered the 2 pack but only one light was shipped.  Had I received the order correctly I would have definitely given 5 stars.
B004M3F5CO|5|this product will certainly do the job. I work for the police department and i had to remove a police decal from our vehicle and replace it with a new one. everyone know that the decals used on an emergency vehicle are extremely difficult to remove. this product mad the job lake it was nothing. i would defiantly buy this product again. also it leaves no residue but do not get in on any plastic because it will discolor it.
B003VLBPJA|3|Good net,but ships from China so it takes a while to get
B008VIB7YG|4|a little on the small side, and could stand to get a little darker, but over all, well worth the money!
B007XE5LTG|4|Could use better instructions for all the detailed functionality but right now it is just a plug and play mode till i go thru all the menu options.  I tested it on 2 newer  cars and the car plug was easy to find and quick to hook up.  I really bought it to check and see if my mechanic was lying to me and maybe even prepare myself for emisssion issues down the road as the car gets older.  It says it has functionality to save data on a computer but i have not figured it out yet; still figuring out how to do that.
B00U6QFQAM|5|Hey, it's a thumb screw! Similar items at Quadratec for a lot more. This do the job.
B00029X5V0|5|Best wipers money can buy!
B007TTDR1Y|5|Just what I expected!
B00T4VFH5E|2|Doesn't work as described.
B00UIURRG2|5|Awesome plugged right in no problem had no issue out of the product
B00VGL6TSO|1|this thing is to large foir a 2 inch hitch and does not hold the hitch cover we bought from amazon snuggly, so it generates a metal sound that radiates through the car.  Very annoying.
B003175VT4|5|Can't go wrong with Ricks rectifiers.
B000931OEO|3|No noticeable difference in leak speed.
B00SZ70TP6|4|good looking,easy install .
B0002F68JK|4|Fits great.
B000CO76Q0|2|it has china stamped right in the center...plain and no markings would have been better. With the markings I cannot send it out to have chromed.
B00L5LQGJM|5|Good quality
B00I1B6SK6|5|Two thumbs up on these supports!!! Super strong and very very easy to install! Now I want to convert my hood to utilize these supports!!
B005OKK5T2|2|Disappointed with the fit. Product says fit existing mounting holes. Off about an inch on each side. Package had been opened when received so I don't know if a different item had been returned in that package.
B0008KLOG6|4|Does what it's been doing since cars were invented. For the price...worked for Lindberg and Hughes Aircraft  so it's good enough for me !
B0009IQXCC|5|great
B004YGRCMA|5|very sharp
B00L4JL1RC|5|Works great - still get excellent reception & no worries about it getting ripped off @ the car wash. If you don't have this, you better remove the existing one or it *will* get yanked. Then there's a big gap for rain to get in the hole & ruin everything. My other car did & luckily it was under warranty & they fixed it. Can be very expensive otherwise. My son-in-law says they have to go inside the car, rip out the soft ceiling covering, re-install the base & seal it, re-install the inside ceiling (or was it put in a new one?), etc. I keep the old one in the glovebox just in case I take a trip to someplace with mountains or spotty reception. Then I get said son-in-law to swap them out. Just gotta remember to swap back before the next car wash!
B00MEVO6YY|5|Love love love these! I put two on my motorcycle and gave the other two to a girlfriend.
B002J8RTF0|5|fantastic!
B00X5EO6VC|5|Works great - Thank you!
B002QOYS42|5|GREAT PRODUCT INSTALLED EASILY AND WORKS GREAT.
B00HYIFK4C|5|This is a very nice looking faucet. We replaced an out dated faucet in our motor home with this one and are very pleased. It was easily installed and works well with no leaks.
B0007TQWJM|5|It works perfectly for our camper.
B000WJ75J8|5|I love, love, love this bag. It fits under the seat of my 2015 Honda Ruckus perfectly. I used black zip ties to attach it to the frame of the bike, I used the shoulder strap clips on either end of the bag to attach it. I figure I won't be removing it from the bike very often (though having a shoulder strap for the bag is very handy), so I might as well secure it so hopefully no one wanders off with it. I also bought a small luggage combination lock that I use to lock the zippers shut when I'm away from the bike. The velcro straps on the bag are well placed and it was very easy to tie them around the frame of the bike. The bag doesn't look very big in person but wow does it hold a lot. I can fit my gloves, goggles, and helmet inside with room to spare. I finally have a place to keep my purse in while I'm riding! I'm very happy with this purchase!
B00HY06SWS|5|The Blue LED'S are great and they look awesome.
B004GCT2S4|5|Very nice exact-fit
B00AWRFAHY|5|Works awesome.  A little pricey but worth it.
B008FCG3XI|5|Nice to have custom fit.
B00IZGDXZK|5|i've used this wrench on my dl 650 and works very well, very easy the oil filter change
B008427CZ2|5|just like the orginals
B00GSAUHB8|5|One of the best and easiest sun protectors to use.  I have bought others and they are a pain to close and open.  This is wonderful.  You place in in your windshield and it keep the vehicle cool.  When you put is away it twists into itself and into the provided bag and will slip into the pouch behind you seat. Great product.  I bought two for the SUVs.
B00HWIFBVQ|5|Good  Amazon excelente app 👍🏻
B000CIXYTE|5|Same as sold in stores, just easier to find.
B002AMPLH8|5|been looking for a turtle and finally found one.  Thanks
B00BZSE5CK|5|Made my Wrangler look even more bad a$$!
B00ALLUJ7W|4|It does what I wanted it to do. Keeps my leather<br />seat cooler.
B006N933F6|3|Thought it was greaseable but is not... that's the main reason I bought these
B002UC30AS|5|We love this! It works great on the side of our camper. The kids love filling in the states!
B00TKNNLVS|5|Looks great easy to install
B00BQN5OX8|5|A lot thinner than the original but quite strong. My wife has trouble pushing closed now. Hope they hold up but would recommend. Easy to install.
B002FY4N3E|5|Excellent...  make the front of the car look like new..  it has been a little less the. A week since installation, but was surprised to see a after market headlight assy sealed properly
B007TXRWGQ|5|fits good on my 2014 road king
B0093XZDS4|5|Help the engine run smoother. Will buy again
B0012P4UDU|5|Great product and easy transaction....Thanks
B009M1VO6C|5|Best led's for interior lighting
B002JH5W0A|5|Perfect! Exactly what was described and exactly what I needed.
B00XKQUE16|4|Great Price for a versatile Helmet Bluetooth<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Loud and Crisp<br />- Easy install<br />- Versatile install (clip or velcro)<br />- CHEAP (comparatively)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- VERY touch sensitive<br />- Non-standard Micro USB (can't use headset with any other device, can't charge with standard micro USB)<br /><br />Overall, it's worth it. I would recommend it.<br />I'm really considering a 2nd device to make it easy to swap out, and install in another helmet too<br />I'm wishing I had gotten the 2-set deal now
B00834RK0S|1|Was the wrong size and almost possible to return
B007USCTW2|5|fantastic sound !
B00IYZ68W2|1|Lousy.  Paint color did not match!  Found better match in generic can of paint from local auto parts store.  What a waste of time and money.
B0083BWUYW|5|Good deal...
B00767D74G|3|to expensive it's just like everyother sun shade
B00M78820I|5|Works great, folds up easy for storage under my seat. It also makes me want to grow a beard.
B0042AJFPK|1|If you're looking for a valve cover gasket to fit a 95 Cherokee (which the advertisement said it would) dont get this one if you have the 4.0 straight 6. Its way too short. Almost looks like it's for a 4 cylinder. Thank god I checked before I pulled the cover off.
B00SX6ZSUK|4|This is cute but, it's really bright pink against a white car. I reordered the light pink tag frame.
B008QURXHY|2|Although the quality seemed to be fine, the covers were supposed to fit our 1986 Mercedes 560SL, but simply didn't.  Returned for refund.  If they had fit, they would have been okay is our guess, as we only wanted the covers to protect the original seat leather.
B00ZVJ33LI|1|Dont like seat covers I can only use the front seat ones backs don't fit wasted my money
B008QDWGN2|5|A plus part and service
B008OYNG32|5|Excellent oem part. Went right in - no trouble! Fit perfectly - good as new!!!
B003UXZ6RG|5|Looks great
B00CGH40LU|5|Easy fit!!  Great sound!!!  Wished I'd done it sooner!!!
B00OYGNCSI|5|Excelente
B00RJB8XU2|2|Helmet didn't have very good padding and since there isn't a model for this product finding a visor in different colors makes it difficult to find anything that will fit if there are any.
B000CITKCE|5|Left it hooked up to my motorcycle outside all winter in colorado and no issues. Motorcycle was under a cover with this tucked under it.
B00SI84BU6|4|I was very happy with all of these items. They met or exceeded my expectations.
B007K2COLO|4|They didn't fit my truck but they are good new
B00O1YQ7NU|1|DO NOT BUY. Hub is junk the washer stack is garbage.
B0114L8OUG|5|Functions exactly as advertised. Using them on my 98 f150, 06 cobalt.Works flawlessly.
