B0000AQS0F|5|Cancelled too soon, but still holds its own in 2015 as the single best thing ever played on a television set.<br /><br />My wife and I have personally introduced 46 individuals to this show (not carefully selected, merely every last person we met who had not already seen it), and of those 46 only one disliked it (stopping after the pilot, which is arguably the worst episode - in a character driven show, the pilot is essentially an introduction-fest), and one other wasn't big on it (stopping after ep. 6).<br /><br />That's 44/46 nearly randomly selected individuals who LOVED this show - including many who strongly disliked sci-fi and westerns. I'm not all that great with probabilities and statistics, but I challenge you to find a show that is more universally loved.
B00F91RYL8|5|The movie got off to a fast and exciting start.  We loved that it was scary without being a gorefest.  Very glad we rented it.
B00GM4H5YM|5|Really great movie.
0316204366|5|Very inspiring book. Shows that hard work and determination are the key to every successful person. High self esteem is critical.
B00000IPAX|4|ENEMA OF THE STATE must the most famous album from BLINK...this one got many hits like WHAT´s my age again, ADAM´s song and All the small things...it´s trully a nice punk pop album like green day on dookie and Ninrod...
B00YTSHPJS|5|From the first pulse, I was hooked.  I will not lie, I was unfamiliar with Michael Giacchino or any of his other work.  Listening to this, I know I'm going to go look for other works by him.  I say enjoy it.  Bobby D
B005HSG3TC|5|Fantastic little case! Not too bulky, but still protective and sleek.  A perfect cover for my new Fire!  Definitely recommended for all Kindle Fire owners.  Protect your investment!
B00GD9F59S|5|Perfect ending to a great series!  My daughter read it first, but then I got hooked!  Really enjoyed every book!
B009GYKESO|1|Yes!  Noisy!  Any movement of these shorts makes a noise similar to shaking a plastic garbage bag.  Just putting them on is deafening; forget about wearing them.  The only time I could imagine them being quiet is underwater, which is okay because the product is meant to be a swim suit; but what about the trip tot the beach?  What about hanging out poolside?  Forget about it.  Save your money.  Returned for refund.
B00DKSVPRG|3|It's a pretty basic hoodie as far as materials go.  Make sure you go 1 if not 2 sizes larger than what you normally wear.  I noticed that the sleeves are also a bit shorter than expected.
B00E5AR4M8|5|I was a little worried that the medium would not fit my adult sister whom is average weight and about 5'6.  To my pleasant surprise, it was a pretty good fit with a little extra room to make a comfy fit.  The quality was very nice as well, the material is extremely soft!  I might get one for myself!
B00B18ML4I|3|I am not sure if I'm keeping this dress yet. I tried it on my 2 1/2 year old daughter who wears a 3T now. I got the size 3, but it doesn't stretch (the cotton) as much as I would like it to, so getting the dress on my daughter on the top part is a little snug. It's a really cute dress, but a little long too. I like shorter dresses.
B00MOV4X88|5|Such a great fit and it is warm and fits snuggly
B00JB3AV60|4|The shirt looks great on me but its is not as thick as it is shown on the picture but I can work with it!!!!! I also ordered 2 sizes up because I read the previews and saw that it runs small. Only problem is that i have chubby arms and it is tight around them.
B008ATDB0E|5|The item was everything I thought it would be and more.  The clothes are very true to size and I am most definitely going to order more..the box with my items in it were arranged and folded perfect.
B00H1PDKQI|5|Wore this I  a wedding.  I had to get it altered to fit my shape exactly,  but I expected that.  Well made, lookec great, arrive exactly as described and WAY sooner then expected, which I appreciated, will purchare from the vendor again.
B006386SBI|5|This robe was everything I hoped it would be, thick, warm, soft and the length is perfect! The price was a little more than what I was wanting to pay but it had the best ratings for that price. I would definitely recommend it.
B00DW5CSOG|5|Very happy. GreAt price
B009WQ20SS|3|I like this hat, it's really cute and warm.  I just wish it fit my head a little more snuggly.  I find that it's longer than I need and a bit wider, so it tends to move up on top of my head as opposed to being down.  I am going to put some stitches into the back of it to make it smaller.<br /><br />I'm petite and probably have a small head so this feedback probably doesn't apply to everyone.
B0064KVJDC|5|This belt is great! I bought it for my boyfriend who is allergic to nickel amongst other things and he loves it.  It's hard to find belts that are nickel free and look nice but this one is both.
B00QUJYQGO|5|Nice quality feel especially considering the price.  Just as functional and actually better made than my fossil wallet before this.
B008V9GQLY|4|Thanks
B0091HQVWY|4|Daenery's is my favorite character so I had to get this! The egg is heavy and great quality and the chain is nice, but the only thing that bugged me was the chain is silver and the egg is more of a bronze type color, but it was worth getting and I love it!! Plus I got a $5 gift card for TV Store Online, not enough to get something from that site, but it's still cool!
B009LEFW0O|5|I ordered this shirt in a 3X knowing it runs small from previous reviews. I usually wear a 1X. It fits perfect and looks amazing on me! I highly recommend this shirt!
B00ABNEQGK|2|Another product I really wanted to like. After reading about the sizing problems I ordered an XXL. This pullover is tighter than some compression shirts I own. Unfortunately they don't sell an XXXL. I am 5'10&#34;, 200 lbs and while I can no longer push weights I remain stocky. This will go to my smallest SIL who is a Police Officer and much smaller.
B00BLW2SCY|5|I love all the blouses that I have ordered and I get so many &#34;I love your blouse&#34;,thanks for a good product !
B008H1Z30G|5|I am a size 40 H this is honestly the only bra I have found that fits me right.  When you are the size that I am you can not just purchase a bra at the store.The bra very comfortable and gives me all the support I need.  Although it says it's a sports bra I wear it as my every day bra as well as to the gym. This is my 3rd bra I have purchased. It is 100% worth it to purchase this bra just for the fit! I only wish it wasn't $60 it is very hard to spend that much money on only one bra. I will  definitely purchase again because I could not find anything else that fits as good as these.
B00KTOMLZO|5|It is better than pictured!  It has such a comfortable fit; no gaps in the underarm area, the length is perfect, and the neckline is not too low.  This style can be worn for a dressy occasion, a fun date, wandering out in the yard, or the Renaissance Faire!  I am thinking of purchasing it in another color just to have two.
B00ARDD51Q|2|Found the cloth material to be very inferior, the color faded on wash. I also found the printed designs to be very dull compared to how it is in the pictures here
B00B4EHXNI|3|This is cute but the material is cheap. I love the color. It would be nice if they used better material.
B004Q2HVXW|1|I was not impressed with these they were not the bows in the picture an they were very cheaply made i wouldnt recommend buying them you wont be happy with what you get although some of them would had actually been cute if they werent so cheaply made.
B00NGYI3OW|1|Do not waste your money on these things.  If you have medium size hands they won't fit.  My hands are small and I  still barely fit in them.  The worst part is wearing them for two hours, the tip of the thumb on one came unraveled. (not cool)<br />What a waste.
B002RBYHOK|4|Bought this for a color run, was exactly what I needed
B0063ICIIA|5|love it!!
B00IODAHQC|2|very comfortable material but it is shiny and looks more like a nightgown than a coverup.  I will not be wearing this to the beach unfortunately.
B00HVMG97S|4|The sweatshirt was a big hit on Christmas morning!
B00596BNUQ|5|very good<br />i vove it<br />it is what i want<br />so nice<br />i like it<br />thans so much<br />it is great
B00IR70SH8|3|It would be nice if the flowers can be interchangeable (attach/detach) with other bands using thin velcro coz a lot of color combinations are just over the top.<br />NO to bright Yellow, super bright Lime Green and Orange headbands.
B000RIQWK2|5|These are quite adorable.  I plan on sewing them on a pair of tennis shoes that I like that now have very small holes in them on the toes.  Probably get a lot of comments on them.  They would be good on any type of apparel.
B00BFW9EO0|3|Came right before Halloween but the lights didn't work on one side. It was too late to exchange so I wore them off. Not as pretty!
B00E6A1LEE|3|I wear a size 10 and ordered the large. It is really big at the top but covers well without flapping open. I added extra Velcro so the excess at the top could have a place to stick. It washes well and is very soft. I use it every day and like it, but I think the wrap with the snaps is better.
B000HZEBEY|3|Seems like a nice (though pricey) product, but the sizing is off.  We bought the 2T-3T size for our 18-month old daughter hoping it would give her some room to grow.  Unfortunately, it is way too big for it to be useful now or in the near future.  It was even too big for our 3 1/2 year old daughter, and she's very tall for her age...
B001I06J8I|5|Others said the fitting was a problem but me I love as a runner it's perfect soft very now I know that it's true to follow instinct after reading reviews which I do and at some point that sense is gonna kick in this time I'm happy I trusted that feeling and not just accept the bad reviews I am. Happy customer.
B00ES8XPNY|2|It took these leggings forever to get to me..over a month.  They are very small-fitting even though they are &#34;one size fits all&#34;.  I wear a size 8-10.  Because they are so snug-fitting, they are rather see-through.  I love the pattern, but the first day I wore them for a couple of hours I found a runner going down from the waist to the bottom of my butt.  Be aware that these run like a pair of panty hose.
B00AEH2DVS|4|It's a little larger then I thought it would be, but outside of that I love it. Plenty of space and separate compartments.
B00063EMRI|5|The colors are very nice.   It's definitely a winner. It looks like silk!
B008L0HD3S|4|fits great!
B00NON62LG|5|Fit nicely, also very attractive under see-though blouses.
B0041OFBNC|4|This is a warm Jedi robe.  I'm 6ft and it drags the ground.  A must for any Jedi.
B0072J9IFU|5|Fast shipping and fit perfectly. Would definitely buy them again. Decently heavy duty so they are great work pants. My husband likes them.
B00V07HZVY|2|The shirt was kind of tight in the arms, and scratchy.
B004WMEPN0|3|Loved the jacket...until I turned to the side.  Then I saw how extremely bell-shaped the butt is.  At first I thought it might be due to the elastic at the waist cinching the coat together that made the back end puff out like a bell, but I've tried on other coats with elastic waists without the same problem.  This jacket is just weirdly out of proportion.<br /><br />It's very warm and the front is stylish.  I wish I could have kept it, but I just couldn't get over how much the back end billows out.  Regretfully returned it.
B001FOR2RO|5|Nice belt for the Dickies work men pants with the wide loops for this kind of belt.  Well made and good looking.
B00ET066TG|4|beautiful
B00L46JJLU|5|I love this Jacket !! It's comfy like a sweater and its stylish as pictured!! No regrets with my purchase at all. Only thing is that you need to keep the jacket in a garment bag or the plastic to store it - it's a magnet to fuzz . Other than that great jacket!!
B00JMC8JDC|5|Love it!
B00KFUSTRG|4|i like that the zipper goes off to the side as i have a boy baby. i dont think this will go 6-12 months but it fits well now. good quality so far used only once. sunsuits for boys are limited & expensive. this is good quality
B00B42Q4LM|5|Really great looking beach hat , well made and fits great. Just used it on my last vacation and basically lived in it.  Very good sun protection.  I use sunblock everyday so keeping out of the sun is very important to me, the width of the hat is perfect for keeping my face protected from the sun. I don't need any more wrinkles than I already have.  :)
B00F4HA964|3|fit tight and the material is like tissue paper, but my granddaughter loved it.
B003K1CSFQ|5|This tie and accessory set are even more gorgeous than the pictures!  The deep red and rich gold blend together elegantly.  In my opinion you shouldn't (and almost can't) dress this set down.  It almost demands a classic navy blue or charcoal gray suit around it to do its justice.
B004M6XUI2|4|Not badly at this price
B001SN4KQS|5|Beautiful Color & Very Nice Material
B00F4CDP6A|5|I'm a curvy girl and this shirt is so flattering on me. I'm really excited for Halloween so I can wear this. My mom saw it on me and decided to get one for Halloween as well. She decided to size up because she didn't want it to be as tight. This arrived much faster than I expected it to, literally a couple days after I ordered it.
B00IIR1A38|4|I have a smaller chest, (small 34 b), I got a size Medium, and it fits fine.<br />No padding at all, but the material is really stretchy and well made. I got the black with design on the left breast, and it's very cute.<br />I wear it with all the shirts that have an odd cut to them, in which all my other bras show too much. Nice cross straps detail in the back. Good overall review and good bra for yoga and light exercise.
B008D30LXM|3|They are comfortable pants. The only issue I have is that they wrinkle way too easily. Every time you sit down ad get up you see all the creases
B00BSLENSA|4|This is a great-looking wallet and well-made, seems of good quality (I've only had it a few weeks, so yet to be seen how long it holds up). The upside and downside are really one and the same. The 2-in-1 feature is great because I can just carry my Driver's License and debit card if I don't want to carry the whole wallet. On the down-side, having the sliding mini-wallet inserted in the front pocket makes the whole wallet a pretty bulky item. I don't carry tons of stuff in my wallet but when I have the front piece slid in it definitely feels pretty bulky. Overall, though, I really like the look of the wallet and the 2-in-1 versatility.
B007WPHSPQ|5|This dress was a great price and fits great. I also love the fabric it is so light and airy!
B009SI915A|5|Before they're up and walking, these are the only socks that stay on my kids.  The little elastic around the ankle isn't too tight but provides just enough friction to keep the socks on.  Worth the money!
B00KM2V7QM|4|Good looking. Fabric could be thicker. I have a feeling it won't last much.
B00EXJCCKK|3|I buy many bodysuits because I am small (5'2&#34; 98lbs) but need something to make my torso sleeker. This one was a little long waisted for me but the non-binding striped fabric around the leg openings is a very nice feature.
B0099NLZ4E|1|I ordered this product and received it on the day correct day. However the corset i received was not this one. They sent me a  leather over the neck halter corset with matching tutu and leather underwear. If i was into bondage i might have kept it. However it didn't fit me at all either. and i ordered a two sizes bigger. Over all not impressed. not sure weather i would order another one or not.
B00EPVTJDO|5|you have created a great style and a great fit with the underwear. I look forward to purchasing many more pairs from your company. I love the look and the feel of your product. I can't wait to see what you come out with next!
B001MXF1DA|5|One size fits all was a little scary. I am most happily surprised. I have explored other lingerie on other sites. They are above my price limit. I gambled on this and won. This fits perfectly and even came with an unexpected thong, that fit as well. The material is thin, as expected. But, it is so soft. Not at all like I expected. I see my long distance boyfriend in two weeks, and know he will love me in it. I am a size 6. This will stretch quite a bit. Elegant Moments gives you an idea of size scale. Elegant Moments will be my go to site for this typed of item. By the way- the packaging was well done. And it came way before schedule.
B00CIYFRI6|2|Too tiny for a large and large  is what iI wear
B00AFQFX2E|4|This is my first pair of Levi's 511 slim fit pants and fit perfect. I can wear them with sneakers of dress shoes. Good quality
B00P4ZYO0I|1|This was the worse made dress I have ever seen. The zipper wouldn't stay zipped.
B00CEZH11A|2|This item is cute but the fit at waist was very odd.  I did not return but would not buy again as she was not able to wear these.
B00I1BMNFK|5|Comfy, beautiful, great sock!
B002QYMCVI|5|I've been in need of a robe but the sleeves were always 3/4 quarter length or the robe was too short.. This one is comfortable , sleeve length sufficient and overall is the best one I've ever owned...If you want a cheaper one, then you get cheaper quality, but.you get what you pay for ,I believe...And furthermore, its not like you buy a new robe every 6 months..If you DON'T get one, its your loss...
B005358EQY|1|I have been dealing with \\"cuffcrazy\\" since November 3rd,2011. I ordered a specific Dorfman Pacific hat from them. It took me a very long time to locate this particular hat. It was to be a replacement for a friend for his birthday and I am fairly computer shopping illiterate. I carefully placed my order, and checked and re-checked my order information before sending it on.<br /><br />They sent the wrong one! I tried to contact them and after finding it difficult, I wrote a not good review, sent it, and someone from \\"cuffcrazy\\" called me immediately! Great! (I thought) The lady looked up the hat I REALLY wanted and said that she would send me a postage free label to print out and return the unwanted hat. I was to get the label on the 12th of November. I would then send back the wrong hat and get the right one.<br /><br />It did not come. Several attempts to call them only gets me a recording. I would really rather have the right hat instead of the money, but at this point, it looks like I may get neither.
B00C2VFH3A|5|My daughter is a big Harry Potter fan, so I thought this might make a good sleep shirt. It was a big success! It's plenty long and quite soft. A bit expensive for what it is, but still a gift I was proud to give.
B009LEG2K8|5|i bought this because i didn't have many shirt that i could wear out.  i love it, very flowly and fits nicely
B00LHVAMTU|5|One of my wife's favorite Christmas gifts this year! Fit as expected.
B00GNV0HW6|5|cute
B000WWDL4I|4|This is my first leather jacket, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I like it a lot so far.  I've been surprised that even in relatively cold weather (some mid-single digit mornings lately) I have still been OK wearing this with a good lined sweatshirt underneath (and a hat and gloves of course).  I usually take a medium in jackets and sweatshirts, but in retrospect I'm wondering if I should have got a large in this (I did get a medium), as it seems that the jacket wears just a little tighter than what I see on other people wearing similar jackets.  The only other issue I have is that the zipper can be a little finicky coming off, sometimes the first segment goes on just a little crooked even when I think I'm being careful, then doesn't want to come apart at the bottom unless you spend some time working it.  Overall though I'm glad I bought it, I wear it all the time.
B0034WDCR4|5|Nice Shirt Very Comfortable!
B00GUQO0UO|3|Bought an XLR for a friend.  The image is not sized up with the shirt.  If you're buying anything other than a small it won't look exactly like the photo.<br /><br />Dissapointed.
B00KMDB1L2|5|Dad loved it!
B002ATW86S|4|I used to be a 30 inseam.  Now I'm a 29 Not your fault but I need them shortened whenever I buy 42 30.  if you have sales on pants sized 42 29 pleas let me know.  Thanks
B004G09H0O|2|If you want to feel like a Champion, look elsewhere. This is a junky product. The fabric has what is called in the garment business a really cheap \\"hand\\". It kind of billows around you. It's a solid fabric, not mesh--it doesn't look on you like in the picture. Trust me, you want mesh. My best advice for great quality and low price is to go to Eastbay and buy their house brand men's mesh short. I have no connection to them--I order from them from time to time and tried a couple of pairs of their own shorts. Far more comfortable, fabric feels great on you, big pockets, washes well and the red color looks terrific.
B000VXG83E|1|The product inside was a different style than described on the packaging....which is what I had ordered.
B00PXTE7W0|5|Super cute and soft! Wear it as a shawl or a scarf! I get complements on it all the time.
B00KXRQY14|2|Ordered an extra large but it firs like a medium.  Didn't state that they run small.
B00JUJ8SVK|5|Got way better quality then expected.
B002KIZOSI|5|Very comfortable and perfect fit for the occasion! Highly recommend.
B0058YHJNO|2|not breathing at all. All the evaporation of the body stays inside.
B00MXX0OTE|5|I received this 2 days earlier than expected and just in time for the really cold weather! My son is 2 yrs old so i got him a 3T and it fits amazing.
B004Q1PO3C|5|This lovely silver net wrap met my expectations and more.<br />It's a lovely accessory for my \\"Mother of the Bride\\" dress.<br />Added just a little extra covering for my arms for an August evening.<br />Beautiful sparkly silver net, tasteful.  Article arrived super quick!
B006UJ3T76|4|I was expecting a storage area that was the width of the belt but it was not.  You have to fold money in half a couple of times and then line them up one at a time to get them into the storage area and I was concerned the zipper would catch the money.
B004M6XUI2|5|Really nice quality and the price is right! Still need to see how it weathers long term use though, only time will tell.
B00M8BAOLO|5|I calculated my shopping and was in shock.  Go figure!
B00186ZHZ8|5|I gave these to my grandson for his 5 th birthday.He loves anything dinosaur and was having a dinosaur party he put them on right away and wore them until bedtime! Fast shipping with my Prime !
B00SVZ9Y94|3|Shirt ran large. The arms and underarms were baggy. Too lose around the shoulders as well.
B004ZA0966|1|Alright so i was kind of excited to get this hat in the mail but when i opened it, it did not have the same logo as it appeared in the picture for the description. It just had the simple Yankee logo on the front...Nothing else. I did not take the hat out of the plastic and I am hoping that I'll still be able to return it for a full refund.
B00KHYFQ7G|4|Everything if fine other than the lase that goes around the body is too short.
B00M2FFCUY|5|They are a little thinner than I expected so not as warm. I wear them with my boots but still wear other socks as well. I was hoping for some that were a little thicker though.
B0077196B4|3|These are fine for now....they suit my purpose......I would recommend them because of the comfortable fit........good buy too.....results are ok.
B00JEGGA8C|5|Super cute had gotten plenty of compliments
B003VYATSK|3|It fit a little large to size. I'm a 30E, and the bra I got would probably have been closer to an F.<br />Pretty, good construction, but not right for me.
B00F1CRRW6|5|I purchased this upon the suggestion of a female friend. Never having felt I needed it, I decided better be safe than sorry. I recently witnessed someone get punched to the ground while the perpetrator ran off into a dark parking lot. Still a little shaken from the incident but I now carry these on my knuckles when I am out alone; like when I am walking the dog at night. I feel I have a pretty good form of protection should I be in a threatening situation.
B00MVAU7O6|5|So soft and they stay up all day!
B00FASSTH8|3|I like the tanks but they are pretty tight. The bust would not fit over a D cup without some &#34;spillage&#34;.
B00HPQII7E|5|Perfect fit, lots of complements about the outfit when I use it. I combine it with the ultragirl shoes in pink from Mini Melissa and is the best mix.
B002X329EW|5|The hoodie is really cute. It is made of that thermal like material, only softer.<br />I'm no young chickee babe (mid 50's) and was worried it was 'too young' for me, but its actually<br />very age appropriate. It goes really well with the black rhinestone tank worn underneath it.<br />It does run really small, so order up 2-3 sizes larger.<br />I typically wear an X-Large and ordered the 2X. Fits nice, not too snug. If you like a looser fit,<br />order up 3 sizes. Otherwise, 2 sizes up seems to work.
B005OPERTG|2|Cute style, but very, very thin.  The fit was short compared to the picture.  Nice color, though. I returned it.
B0011IST5I|5|Great item and I received it very fast and  just in time for Halloween. Worked perfect   all night and did not fall off till very late  and I'm sure I was not being careful that late!
B00C814WCQ|5|Good quality, colors look like the photos. Color has held up after several washes.
B00V9PJ3O4|2|It doesn't fasten. I was not a fan.
B00O4CLENM|5|Wish it came in black and white!
B009JJRIN0|5|I love my shirt it's perfect!!!!
B00H7IMYS4|5|I absolutely love what I got.  Great product and great service. Recommend this product to anyone.  I am ordering more for my daughter.
B00JUM30VA|4|Good product  for the price. Fit was a bit smaller then I expected since I usually buy one size bigger to insure a baggier fit instead the hooded sweatshirt fits a bit snugly. So I suggest to others to buy 1 size bigger then you would normally order.
B00HZT6GDO|4|Bought this shirt for my brother-  He loved it, and it fit very well.
B00GW7ZVTK|1|This dress is nothing like the dress I ordered.  It is ill-fitting and has a full skirt - not a slim fitting skirt with a mesh inset at the hemline.  In fact, the dress is labeled as a BCBG label dress NOT a Vince Camuto.  This is frankly theft.<br /><br />What is most distressing to me is that there was NO PURCHASE ORDER included with the dress in the packaging so I have no way to return it.<br /><br />I WILL NEVER order clothing from Amazon again - there are too many other online resources for ordering clothing that are reliable and RETURNABLE.<br /><br />Extremely disappointing and distressing.<br /><br />Victoria Lavan Liberty
B00246M97U|5|Great
B00CDOEA3O|5|it looks nice
B0042GT3QU|5|love it
B00MQXYWK8|3|The material is a thin jersey.  It fits just like a t shirt dress.  Since its so hot this is great for the office but it does hug around my waist more than expected so i needed a foundation garment for it to hang right.  The length is just past the knee.  I think I will wear it with my black blouse and pearls to work.  Very easy to wear and pulled together.
B0047EH2TM|5|So I had to.<br /><br />Very nice and fun for all! Good fit, nice for the price and look forward to getting others as well.
B001TD1KZG|5|This cami is of exceptional quality and a very reasonable price. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another on. It is worth every penny!
B0009945W6|4|I bought this umbrella as a gift.  I was specifically looking for a clear bubble umbrella with white trim and expected it to be so when I placed the order, but upon receipt, I found that it actually has silver trim.  That's why my review gets 4 stars because there isn't a clear picture of the item on the web and you don't know what to expect exactly.  But to be fair, I was pleasantly surprised because of the quality.  Its construction is so much better than the bubble umbrellas I've seen in stores.  The frame is quite sturdy and the handle is very substantial.  The handle seems to be made of lucite, and starts off silver and fades to clear, which is pretty cool.  It even has a lifetime warranty.  I would recommend it.  It's a great umbrella that looks stylish, and you can see where you're walking without any obstruction.  What better way to enjoy the rain?  The person I gave this too loved it.
B00GFGPX0A|5|Ready to wear them when the warmer weather gets here.
B001EHBJSU|5|To me, this costume was even more hilarious after I put it on. The hat that comes with it is a little flimsy and small as previously stated. It's strap was tight around my throat and I don't have a big head! I ended up buying a different hat to go with it also.
B002DZLCFM|5|EXCELENTE  MUY  BUENA  ATENCI&Oacute;N  Y  EL ARTICULO DE BUENA CALIDAD LOS RECOMIENDO :D PUNTUAL TODO BIEN RESPONSABLE  Y Y Y
B005D0KV5Q|5|Good quality. Not too thin. I like the thicker material so my shoes don't rub too much. Colors are nice too. Definitely recommend!
B00DRGXE5M|4|Fits perfectly. Has turned into one of my daughter's favorite uniform shirts.
B00M1KO3XC|5|Very good
B00NO4GYU4|3|It was too big. I went by the chart. I need a 38 but they didn't have it in stock, so I guess I'm stuck.
B006U9R576|5|My friend wore this tie set to a wedding and received compliments all night long. Looks much better in person, I highly recommend shipper. The item arrived promptly and just as described.
B001U2ZYIU|4|My daughter bought this for gymnastics, and she loves the fit and how comfortable it is.  It is &#34;soft&#34; and not itchy, and it does not ride up.
B002YBEGT4|5|made prefect Christmas gift for my co worker
B007PP4BBM|4|Little tight for XL, great graphics, although RED color was not as portrayed in photo. Spartan Head graphic imposed over the Molon Labe title.  Need to get latest printed version on Website photo listings.<br /><br />Fantastic T-Shirt products, great crafting! Super packaging and shipping!<br /><br />Fast shipping and great product, A+
B002VLYX6I|1|I've never written a bad review ... until now!  I purchased the correct size but the \\"support fabric\\" constantly rides up and is really uncomfortable.  I've worn them once and cannot wear them again.  I wish I could get my money back...
B0091CODCY|3|In a typical dress size, I am between a 4 and a 6. The last AK dress I ordered in a 6 was large and had to be exchanged for a 4. This dress turned out to have the same problem as the other one: even in the 4, the dress is slightly large (I'm a little scared to go down to a 2) and very long. I'm 5'4&#34;, average weight and I have a shorter torso (longer legs.) The dress (and the other AK one I got) hit me below the knees. I'm taking the other one in for adjustment, but this one is being returned.<br /><br />One of the reasons I'm choosing not to keep this dress is because although the fit is flattering (although the length is not), the skirt part of the dress is pretty see-through. I'd have to wear a slip with it, even though it looks like it comes with a slip (the &#34;slip&#34; is actually a thin black material that would normally make a slip, but since the dress is lace, the &#34;slip&#34; is what you see through the lace.)<br /><br />Overall, AK dresses are well-made, but it's definitely for taller people. Keep in mind as you shop!
B00DSJ1162|5|Love this material, and it looks very elegant.<br /><br />The pin that came with it is adorable, and I can wear it with other items of clothes.
B00CK4WH3M|4|It was  a gift for my daughter. She said she likes it and she's pretty picky. 4 stars for poor custumer service.
B00BYNET1S|5|Men should probably not review women's clothing... on second thought maybe we should.<br />This dress is very flattering and accentuates all other wonderful curves.<br />I plan to look at the same manufacturer for other &#34;date-night&#34; appropriate clothing.
B00E4XR6F6|5|Very nice and doing business with those affiliated with Amazon is always a pleasure.
B001K2EBNY|5|Boyfriend won't take this thing off in the winter.
B00CBETY8W|5|Really good<br />thanks
B00BQS4YY8|4|Very nice fabric and color. Pleasantly surprised how nice it is and what good fit. Would buy another in different color.
B00HQ9GN5Y|5|Love it
B00K5T4AQG|5|The short is great and very confortable for the gym. But you need to fix your page because the colors don't match. I selected the blue and you sent the green.
B000W5OTX2|2|We ended up sending this costume back.  The quality of the fabric was not good and it smelled like melted plastic.
B000VKR49O|4|Originally bought 2, though a little too tall a hat for me, it met my needs and I liked it well enough to buy another in a different color.  Overall, satisfied
B004N86644|5|I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon and seldom leave a review even if I really like a product. But I liked these pants sooooo much and noticed they didn't have any reviews so I thought I would leave one. These pants are so comfortable. They fit me perfectly and made my 43 year old bum look pretty darn good :)  The fabric is stretchy and comfortable. They are form fitting but not TIGHT! They are of great quality and have some really cute details. And they are a GREAT price! I paid $12.99 --- WHAAAAAT!?  I bought the navy ones and I'm going to buy the gray ones right now.
B00CYKOTA6|5|Clothes came fast, nice material for the winter time, and true to size. Have been washed a couple of times and have not faded or unraveled in any way. Great price too.
B000UJGN7U|5|I bought 5 different colors for 3-week vacation. Lighter weight for Spring / Summer, wash well, inexpensive. I did take them up an inch. I don't like them as long as younger people can wear them.
B004AR8Y4S|4|I like the hat it fits my head like most hats do no complaint there. If I would have to complain about it, it would be that he front patch area wasnt sewn on evenly its crooked otherwise solid.
B00028AVL8|5|They survive NYC Sanitation work, through the elements. Happy I was able to get them at a bargain. thanks again.
B00PLM1NEO|5|Loved the way the leggings fit.  I'm 5'1&#34; but the length was nice and the feel of the fabric is very nice.  I'm on my way to purchase a few more pair!!
B00XLTWU28|5|Very nice dress. Well worth the price.
B00LGRXZQW|5|Great weight for keeping you warm in a freezing acting class.  Easy to move in and works well for tall young women too.
B00GNL59WY|4|It's not even close to the true size.
B00012LERK|5|These are, without a doubt, the best socks I have ever worn.  I have large calfs and have always had a very hard time keeping socks up, especially when riding.  When we go horse-back riding, we usually ride anywhere from 2 to 8 hours at a time.  It is very frustrating when your socks continually fall down around your ankles.  It is hard to bend over and keep pulling your socks up while going up or down a mountain on horse back.  I have been wearing Justin socks for approximately 8 to 10 years and will never wear anything else while riding.  I even prefer them any time I wear jeans, whether riding or not.  They are definitely the &quot;BEST&quot;.
B00FRA3L2M|5|Great shorts.  They breath well and seem to be durable.
B00141A9P0|2|The head mask is too large and covers her whole face. It does not sit on the head as pictured.<br />My 2 yo removed it the minute she put it on - same for my 3 yr old niece
B00TPRIMA4|5|This dress is AWESOME!  It's lightweight-sort of like a tee shirt- and very flattering for my full figure.  It showcases the positives (cleavage) and camp's the negative (tummy and thighs).  The only thing I worry about is that because of it's thin material I don't see it holding its shape once washed..so I've just dryell'ed it.
B005LX71M6|5|The Filson vest is one amoung several Filson outer ware garments worn over the years. Good quality for a reasonable price. After all , you might as well have the very best.
B000GTNUPW|5|Needed footless for recital. These are great fit, great quality and nice material. Just exactly what we needed. Seems like they would last a while.
B009TB1K2I|5|Hat is olive green, nothing like the shade of green in the picture.  Love this hat though. Have it it almost every color
B00GUDSV1Q|5|Excellent item wash and wear. Nice and sturdy
B00H4W7M4E|5|i am very satisfied
B00C40PB1W|4|The only thing I don't like about this hoodie is that it is very plain jane. Other than that, it fits well and Quicksilver is always a good brand to have.
B00C5QC48I|5|I like the sweater very much-has a very good fabric, perfect fit,, love the color to.My dother love the pin.
B00G2NTIW0|5|My husband really likes this scarf wants more colors
B001EO0TMA|3|I bought this dress to wear as a bridesmaid dress for a wedding. However, I wasn't very impressed with it. The fabric looks cheap and is very stiff, the sash snaps together, and good luck breathing in it when you sit down! There is no stretch to this dress. I normally wear a size 12 pant and large top, and even the XL was a little snug on me. I do like the look of the dress, and I feel like if I was someone with a flat stomach and not so wide hips, it would have fit and looked a lot better.
B00TI5C1Z0|5|Love this suit!  I am 73 & wanted something not with high cut legs, it looks great on & I usually order a petite small (4'10&#34;) & 115lbs.  I read the reviews & the size chart, have never ordered a large but I wear a 34F bra & according to the size chart it said a large.  I was worried but it fit perfect!  I would definitely recommend it to a friend or anyone!
B00IFME0XS|5|I am wearing this in my fourth grade May Day show. I love it and will wear it all summer! Yay!
B0021WIZYI|5|I try to remember to put a water resistant Sunblock (I use Neutrogena's dry touch spf 70) on the backs of my hands each morning before leaving my house to reduce the development of brown spots on them (some people call them liver spots but they are caused by sun exposure.)    However, about half the time I forget the sunblock as I don't keep all that stuff on the bathroom counter (I like to keep everything put away in drawers.)  So I bought these goves in the extra small size (several reviewers said they run large - thanks for the warning!) and keep them in my car so I can slip them on if I forget the sunblock.  (As soon as I see my hands on the steering wheel I think \\"sunblock\\"!)    I didn't buy the white ones - I choose the off white color so they'd be less noticeable, and would not look dirty as fast.      Here's my advice on keeping your hands from looking the way your grandmother's hands did:  Use Retin A (generic name tretinoin) on the backs of your hands EVERY night before bed - after washing your face and brushing your teeth (you don't want to get your hands wet after applying it as it would be less effective.)    1- the brown spots you already have will start fading dramatically - don't waste your money on drugstore or dept store \\"fade\\" creams as they can cost as much as generic Retin A, and aren't nearly as effective.  You should be seeing a dermatologist once or twice a year for a thorough skin cancer check anyway so just ask for the prescription at that time.     2 - the skin on the back of your hands will get thicker - the tretinoin causes an increase in collagen.    If you have the money, you can get a prescription cream (that most insurance companies don't cover) like Lustra Ultra or Tri-Luma.  These creams combine tretinoin and hydroquinine - the latter of which has been used for years to light skin.  Though these creams are expensive, they work faster on those brown spots than just generic tretinoin alone.
B00CO59J2E|5|Comfortable and quiet
B00BZ5V0LM|3|The dress fit like it should. Although I did have the same problems other people were having. Went to put the dress on and the zipper came right off and the length of the dress is about a foot to long. I fixed the zipper and stitch up the end so it wouldn't come up and had to helm the bottom. When I did all of that the dress looks good on me.
B00FR6NCDE|5|pretty
B004U0IRGU|5|Kids love these. Good buy, getting more for gifts.
B000HBTLCK|5|This is a good quality shirt. Very well made. The material is soft, yet thick and tough. The picture on the front has survived the washer and dryer numerous times.  Too bad it's so darn expensive. If I hadn't gotten an amazon gift card for my birthday, I wouldn't have gotten these. I feel positively spoiled rotten just wearing this shirt.  If I could afford it, I'd have 7 shirts like this one, each with a different picture. I love you, The Mountain.
B00EAATQTM|5|Great experience.
B001D0RNW4|4|The coat was great except the color was very light, almost light cream colored.  It was returned
B00WIYJNIG|5|Love it!
B00CMQ9ITO|5|Awesome looking belt. Very smart.
B008P4ICMQ|3|Great fitting shirt. Women comment on how soft they are when you first get them, but that goes away over time and washing obviously.<br /><br />They're pretty durable. I'd say mine last about 2 years before they're in a condition in which I want to replace them, but can still be used for a long time afterwards as general purpose shirts (working in the yard, working out, etc.).<br /><br />Still expensive for what it is though- a rather plain t-shirt.
B00AQZFYJQ|4|The crinoline works as it's supposed to, in that it holds out the skirt.  However, if I wear it at my true waist it sticks out of the bottom of the skirt four or five inches.  Essentially, whenever I wear the crinoline with the dresses, I have to pull it up to my bra line, and make sure it stays there all day, which is somewhat inconvenient.
B003DWBFYM|2|didnt realize it was going too say pussy on the back dont believe i have seen one like it before
B00PK9KESE|5|Love it!
B00BHILMP6|5|I ordered the same size as my regular Lee jeans and these fit the same.  They are very comfortable and soft.  I am normally not a jeans person as they usually bind me in the midde (mummy tummy) and end up being uncomfortable by the end of the day.  But these were completely comfortable! I hope Amazon offers these in a capri length for summer!
B00HNTZAQA|3|didnt cover my whole nipple used only 1 time but it was cute though
B0081HP92I|5|I purchased this hate because I try to avoid sunlight.  My purchase was based purely on functionality, but when I tried it on, I was pleasantly surprised at how cute it is as well.  The hat breathes well, so my head doesn't hold in all the heat.
B003B9J846|1|Looks nothing like the picture, wild and frizzy, my daughter refused to wear it with her Halloween costume.  Waste of money!
B000MXB5DG|5|I have been wearing the same style bra for years and have purchased from others online and have had a problem with the fit.....this is by far the best fit and most comfortable bra I have gotten....vendor will definately be book marked for future purchases.    I did have a problem with shipping BUT when I called customer service they were most cooperative in tracking the shipment and keeping me informed.....it was well worth the extra few days wait!!!!
B00ABNEQIS|4|Great product but ran very small. Size up AT least 1 size. Tru spec makes one that is more true to size but the condor is better quality. I usually wear a large in a regular under armour hoodie and ended up needing a XXL for the condor.  But the grid fleece is awesome for those in between days
B0058D1PU8|3|I was able to return this without any trouble and got my credit it seemed to be made well was pleased with the prime great service even on the return used local ups's store to send back great directions on returns
B003L6ZGX6|5|I took another reviewer's suggestion and ordered the next size up thinking these belts may, as he said, run a little small. My inclination was to order a Large (size 38-40\\") as that's the size pants I usually wear. However, when I measured my actual waist, it was 44\\" (shame on me!) so I ordered the belt in XL 42-44\\" size. Turned out to be too big, considering there's a LOT of stretch in these things and I don't wear my pants directly on my waist. I returned it to the vendor and they sent me the smaller size L, which fit perfectly. So good, in fact, that I am about to order another. Incidentally, BeltOutlet.com's customer service is excellent and the quality of the belt is very good for the money.
B005CSV3YW|5|I bought this to wear during cool days when something really warm isn't necessary, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover it's warmer than it looks like. You could even wear it during winter. The quality, as with almost all CAT products, is excellent, and it looks great. I love it.
B008N05FJK|5|I love this dress! It is great and I get a lot of compliments. love the zipper!!! I wore it on vacation and also on my bday!!
B00EALKI2K|5|Verrrrry nice blazer , your son will stand out, as advertised , color is nice, a light blazer more like summer and spring
B00PMCBPHS|5|I love it
B008Q0E61U|5|Needed some  now I have  8 which is good.
B00TINFFSC|2|The bodice & armholes are a tad too big.
B004X2GARS|5|My wife enjoys the fit and the feel - relaxing in class
B00IFGGN1Q|1|Not nice material and fix extremely large. . . I'm donating them they are such poor quality.
B00B7EO9G4|5|My son and husband love these hats.  They fit an adult head just fine and can be adjusted to fit a child's head.  Great quality and the letters are embroidered on the hat along with &#34;super Mario bros&#34; on the back of the hat.  Super deal and highly recommended!
B00RDLALT4|5|It hangs a bit low, but the straps can be taken up.  There is room for a bust, and that is not always the case for things made in the orient. This dress is good for a size 6.  I'm size 4 and sometimes 2, so it's a bit big, but that is better than too small!
B00AUEL4GK|5|Excellent cargo pants, fit as expected, the thick fabric feels very nice and durable, i really like these pants!
B005COJWXU|5|Looks exactly like the picture. It's super soft and well made. The shipping really isn't great, but I got it the day before leaving for my next con.
B00DKA41SE|5|This is the most functional wallet I have owned in such a long time AND it looks UBER COOL too!!!  I would not trade it for the world.  It fits all my cards, money, and even just the check part of my check book) without straining the zipper.  The zipper is extremely easy to use, well designed for this wallet and smooth to work.  (We all know that zippers make or break a wallet)  Perfect wallet for $25 and free shipping, especially a Loungfly brand.  I would easily recommend it.
B002K01DSG|5|Great pair of 'dummy' socks, just like the original Defeet Aireators I still have from 10 yrs ago.
B000GTDX0E|3|These were drf worth the money, they are very warm on pretty cool too. A good buy
B008VPQNLG|2|I had ordered the striped black and purple but received all black, I got them mainly for the striped purple. Also my boyfriend is a Large which I had ordered but these def. fit like an XL..... guess I'll see how he likes them and just cut my $10 loss
B007OWNIHE|5|I bought it for my pregnant wife, and she loves it, is very comfortable and cool. Would recommend it without a doubt.
B001D07Z40|5|I bought this wallet for my husband, to replace the one he'd worn to shreds. He's very happy with it. He tends to fill his wallets much fuller than most people, so this one is pretty stuffed. It's a nice quality leather and the hole detail is a rather elegant touch. It came in a really cool box that had a drawer, and I liked that too.
B003H6DCBS|3|Sizing was off, could have been better.
B00U1TRAC6|5|EXCELENTE
B00D9LH91A|5|I love these jeans.  Fits true to my expectations. Looks awesome.  Wears soft and comfortable.  Couldn't ask for more.  And looks MUCH better in person than in the pics on Amazon.
B00E1LAMEI|4|Nice.
B00MF8K6W2|5|Fit exactly as it should have and we received so many &#34;Awwws&#34; and compliments.  This is a well built costume for your little one.<br /><br />We bought a size bigger to allow more under clothes as we live in the midwest.  This helped with the colder temps.
B0032AMW10|5|What a great hat! The quality is great. The fit is great. The flexibility is great. I use it when my family and I go to the beach house. It packs very well and does not lose its shape. I saw the same hat being sold at little surf shop nearby for nearly twice as much. It was great knowing that I got such a great deal. Any ways, I would definitely recommend this hat to a friend.
B00B90Q01S|1|box was ripped up . wallet looked used. black was kind of faded an leather is very thin. cards hardly fit unless i force it.
B000NOGF2A|3|Even though I read the reviews stating it is small, I'm a small person (5' 2&#34;) and thought it would be fine.  It's ok, and I use it - but it definitely seems like a children's size, not a small adult.
B002BM2F6C|1|i bought this for my daughter for her birthday. it broke off the chain the day afterward, and you can't see the inscription because the inside of it turned black. and it's made out of very cheap material. don't buy it. a waste of money.
B0094PJYJK|5|I just love this buclke.....If you like a chunky buckle...This is it. I would recommend it to a friend, I would buy again.
B00N444O24|2|I needed a new nursing bra but didn't want to spend a lot. So I guess you get what you pay for. The nursing clasp on one of the straps lays a certain way that it digs into me. It leaves a red mark and it hurts! Otherwise it fits well and is ok. Not very flattering but what nursing bra is?
B003IBR38A|4|Great quality mask, perfect for our uses. Shipped just in time. Only problem was the braiding along the edges was pulled too tightly on one side and wouldn't stay attached. We were able to pull the end of it loose enough that we could superglue it back in place properly.
B00ACAV606|5|My daughter was super geeked that she received this. It didn't arrive in time for Christmas, but she was excited anyway.
B007TT7DC8|5|Perfect
B001XJD6YE|5|I have an extra large bust and nothing seems to hold up the girls.  This bra did it and is very comfortable!  No wires!  Also minimizes.  Wish it was less expensive but will buy another one anyway!
B002MGB5C2|5|I bought these mainly to wear around the house for comfort and to sleep in and they work just fine. They are very comfortable and fit well. If you wanted to use them for yoga they would work wonderfully because they are very flexible.
B0056ZAPWW|5|Love love love it! Easily adjustable and keeps my ears nice and warm in the North Dakotan -30 weather. A good buy
B00FL28VI0|5|Came on time and as advertised.
B009TLTIY0|4|Silver jeans are my favorite brand by far. The pockets are in the right place, for one. I'm a fairly athletic girl...regular visits to Crossfit has left me with muscular thighs and a smaller waist. These jeans fit perfectly and I've tried them all. These have just the right amount of stretch and are amazingly comfortable. Not to mention really cute.<br /><br />My one complaint is that they tend to run for the first few washes. I run them through with vinegar in the washing machine, which helps, but it's not my favorite thing to do.
B0014M31A4|4|Fits as expected,  has kangaroo pouch pocket which I don't like
B00M2P7M0M|2|Item was too large, but beyond that, the color was not as depicted  in picture.  It was splotchy in appearance.
B006LN3HW8|5|It has really come in handy this winter with as cold as it's been.
B00DC0TKGK|2|This is a soft bra and that is about it.  It is not supportive in any way and after a day of wearing, doesn't stay where I would like it to be no matter how I adjust it.  At first it fits and feels pretty comfortable, but then I realized it does nothing for my shape  and doesn't stay put underneath as the band stretches out during the day.  The double layer on the cups shifts and makes bulges on the edges and wrinkles in the middle. Too much effort for too little return.
B000UZT70E|5|Supportive t-shirt bra, adjustable straps, affordable, comfortable, easy. Just bought another. It's my new favorite bra. I wish it came in a few other colors.
B003G42UPA|5|My husband is so pleased with his new pj's. The fabric is so soft and comfy, the colors and design are manly...and I like 'em too. #1 wife Texas
B0042CNZJ0|4|I got this and my husband and I love it my only issue is that it is very short. Its not as long as it shows in the photo.
B00BPIHV1M|5|I got this to wear because I wanted to make my son laugh. He is so into Game of Thrones. He's the one that introduced me to it and we love talking about the show. It's a nice T-shirt. Thanks.
B00387EF12|1|Much like the review below mine this belt sucks. Bought it on April 27th, it broke on June 9th so mine didn't even last 2 months! I'm 5'5 140 pounds and a 29in waist so it's not like there was a lot of stress put on this thing. For $30 this is a complete and utter rip off. Funny how the window to return was May 31st and it broke 9 days later. Don't waste your money. The one star is really only because there's no option to give it zero. The belt looks good but it just terribly built.
B002R0F9UM|5|excellent article, I arrive as expected and good quality, I leave satisfied. 100% recommended, is a serious and responsible seller.
B00F4O2VCM|5|I love this robe. I'm small in size plus only 5ft tall. Its nice and soft plus it keeps you warm. The sleeves come down to my wrist which I like. Its a little longer on me cause I'm short but I like it that way.  I like the strap cause its sewed on the robe. Would recommend this robe to all women.
B0088FT3G6|5|Delivered what I was looking for - 6-8 Credit and Bank Cards with some Cash. Superb craftsmanship with the soft feel of leather. Item delivered in excellent condition and nice packaging to avoid any scratch. I think this to be one of BEST purchases on Amazon.<br /><br />I would love to buy one more in Brown color when ever it is available as a spare one. Great product to recommend. My recommendation to make it 5 Star PLUS is to add an ID slot at the back of the wallet.
B006LHN9YK|5|My son loves perfornance boxers over regular boxers, they are great for sports
B00AXIU8SI|4|Good vest for the price
B00B7AHTUQ|5|Adorable and it fits perfect! In love with it!
B00JVKX28C|4|Blouse is really beautiful, I liked it a lot, but the size is very small, typically I use medium size I bought the L size and feel a little tight.
B00KW3TWW2|4|Swimsuit fits perfectly - great for the price!  I'm 5'4, 120 lbs and 36B - both the top and bottom fit.  It's exactly like in the picture.
B00ST2E1D8|3|This bra is soft, pretty and well made.  unfortunately it runs small.  I wear size 44 bra, and ordered the size 4x because of some reviews stating it runs small.  It is too tight.  I am going to wash it and see if it will stretch, and I might order the 5x which should fit better.
B00SFN3XDK|5|Lovely
B000OPGXPC|1|completely not what you expect will arrive.  I ordered for only the one pair and received three bright striped pink pairs
B00JJ3P22U|5|I bought this as a gift and the recipient said it was &#34;perfect!&#34;
B00B36168K|5|fits well, but quality could be better for this brand. not exellent but it is ok,someone could say that the shirt is too long.
B00NTUJTFA|5|Ordered this in beige this one fit tighter I ordered them both in xl I am 5'11 230lbs. It fit my too fine and makes me look great
B005Q65C4M|5|Ended up purchasing two sets - a Large and a Medium - to fit my mis-matched measurements. So I'll be &#34;covered&#34; in any event, e.g. weight gain or loss, either &#34;upstairs&#34; or &#34;downstairs&#34; - or maybe even both. 'nuff said....
B00SLTPN9U|4|Fits great. Got tons of compliments wearing it.  It is a little thin though, I had to wear a tank under it.
B00K8PIV0I|4|WE LOVE IT
B001ULDA2S|2|S***ty quality, a rivet popped off in the first week of wear, the zipper does not stay up.. or maybe super skinny doesn't work to conceal a python...
B006AD4EEY|5|My daughter is 22 and she's hard to please as far as gifts are concerned. Gift cards are cash are always a hit, but I think there is a great deal to be said for the traditional process.  So... I was a tad worried about her reaction....<br />She LOVES,LOVES,LOVES everything about this silly t-shirt! It's hysterical! Appears likely I'll be ordering from you all on a frequent basis. Thank you for delivering a solid, high quality product and topping off the buying experience with an outstanding level of customer service.
B0033BBD36|5|I give this tie a five star rating because of its value.  I have only a couple of dozen ties and rotate through a few each year.  Some of my ties are from high end men's clothiers but most are from dept stores like Macy's.  This tie by Y&G equals the best ties I have owned in quality, and at a much lower cost.  It is heavier than most I own, but not so heavy that it is difficult to tie.  It does make a larger knot, so keep that in mind.  The silk has an excellent sheen and is pressed very nicely.  My tie showed up with one very small snag unfortunately but I don't think it's even enough that I will return it.  Overall, very good value.
B00PQWG6LO|5|Very nice and soft, warm and fits - I ordered med/large as my man is 5'9&#34; and 144lbs, he likes it so good gift for me to give him.
B00E8GRADC|4|I was expecting it to be thin and flimsy like most of the other clothing companies sell. I was surprised to find it was a quality sweater that was thick and decently warm. I am between a medium and a small, the small fit pretty good. I also managed to get the upper half in a family Christmas photo. Hilarity and anger ensued.<br /><br />Make sure you do not machine wash this. Hand wash only.
B00J2F0GVM|4|I gave it to my mother in law and she loved it. Didn't fit me.
B00LK0BZLC|4|These are great for casual wear as they are neat but not too dressy. I understand they have been discontinued by Dockers. Too bad.
B0030BELDS|4|It's pretty easy to reverse the belt. Keep in mind this is a very wide belt with a large buckle.
B00KN0PW28|3|Cute dress. The sizing is too big and will need alterations. Please read fine print with return policy with the company before buying. Even though it says Prime shipping with Free Returns that is NOT the case.  The company has a return policy of its own that is not in line with Amazons.  Cute dress just needs a little more work.
B000J41P1U|5|Brand new pants and less than 20 bucks!
B00DQYQJ4I|5|Keeps you dry and not sweaty is what I want from a rain jacket. Here in Hawaii we have torrential rain sometimes. But it never gets that cold. This is perfect.
B00BCXNVBY|5|it a great shirt beautiful color and style in the future I will buy more original penguin shirt good quality and the price on amazon is excellent
B00OAJUYR6|4|I bought this for my wedding or after my wedding and I haven't worn it yet hopefully it fits very well when I put it on
B00BXPO480|3|I wear a small in yoga pants and the reviews were pretty mixed about whether they run small or big or long or short so I just ordered my regular size. They are a bit too tight and too short so I just returned them and ordered a size up. The color (mocha) is pretty true if not slightly darker than pictured but no complaints and the material is fine.... they're yoga pants, not sweat pants! My advice, just order a size up and you'll be good.
B008VVVWPC|5|Bright and easy to apply and fast service from seller
B008KATCO2|3|I would definitely order one to two sizes larger when ordering. My husband is usually a L-XL and we needed a XXL and it just fit.
B00DOVM2XK|2|looked pretty on the website but that´s not really, runs so small , material very cheap, don´t lose your money.
B00DS30YTS|4|Fits very nicely. Neck a bit low for my taste, so wear over a shell. Doesn't feel like typical cotton sweaters (not fuzzy) and feels like it will keep its shape better than cotton.
B000O7PBDA|5|My husband loves this belt...So hard to find an adjustable belt... Reversible....PERFECT
B002NTS5W6|3|These bindings are okay. They take forever to get set up. Also snow build up on the bottom greatly affects how they work. The back heal rest angle adjustment doesn't lock very well, so it is apt to change during a long day of riding.
B009YVVD52|5|Very good quality
B009BKWE9U|5|Excellent to travel!!!
B00JEHD1UG|4|great design so so quality but for the prize, its great and worth every penny. Would buy it again or recommend
B005536PL0|4|Like the outfit. It was a little too small.
B001CJC9BG|5|Great product!  Product does as advertised and is useful.  And the price cannot be beaten.  Will buy this product again!
B00O0ZTGZ6|5|So much fun to wear
B0006U5HKC|4|Love these but wish they weren't so expensive.
B00EZT1OOS|5|HOLY CRAP THIS IS FREAKEN AWESOME!! I need to grow a full goatee now so i can be evil just like in the mirror universe!! Great Price! SUPER FAST SHIPPING!!! and the pin is perfect!! BWAAHAHAHAA
B00EFEPHT6|3|The top is just like the picture. But it does run small. I ordered a medium based on the measurements and it fits tight. It isn't unbearable so I won't exchange it, all I recommend is to order a size up. It is perfect for a Fionna cosplay, which is what I bought it for.
B00HX9ZF0Q|5|These are a really good quality pant as I find most Lee products are..  Great fabric with just a hint of stretch but not too much as to have bagging issues. They fit at the natural waist with a comfort waist band.  The fit is true to size. For 25 bucks they are a steal.
B00GMED1OA|2|With a three digit price tag, I sure expected better.  The print is gorgeous, the colors are great and the suit itself, while oddly sized, should in theory be very flattering.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />As previous reviewers have mentioned, the sizing is WAY off.  I am normally comfortable in a regular 16, but based on other reviews, I bought a 2x.  I shimmied myself into the suit (and let's be honest - the extra squeeze isn't bad if it flattens out my wrinkles), but the cup size is ridiculously large and unflattering.  The suit itself was a fairly decent fit, but the cup size was made for DDD cups or something.  I'm a solid D and I could still fit a sock in each cup if so desired.<br /><br />No big deal, because the print is so darn cute that I'm going to just cinch the sails down with the optional strap. BUT when I opt to try to wear it with the included strap, one of the slots for inserting the strap was completely sewn shut in the seam. Just poorly executed workmanship.<br /><br />Still at this point and even considering the triple digit price tag, I am prepared to deal with it, until I notice the third and fatal flaw in the pool - one of the seams on the outer skirt portion is completely come undone.  The sides have clear elastic tape serged into the seams in order to create a gathered look.  The elastic was broken, the seam was completely undone and I was stepping into the pool in my expensive and very flawed designer suit.  At this point, I had been wearing it for about twenty minutes.<br /><br />All that considered, have I mentioned that the print is adorable?!?  It will be going back for a replacement and I hope to at least get one with better workmanship.
B00ORI2P8Q|5|Warm and comfy
B0093JFTY6|4|I've only had it for a couple weeks and it turns heads where ever I go. I like the design and the fact that it's very lightweight and doesn't feel overly bulky in my pocket. The card pockets can occasionally make you drop one or two out of the wallet from time to time, which is irritating and the only reason I have for not giving it a perfect rating. All and all, I am satisfied with it and reccomend it to anyone who may have been curious about it like myself or just want to pick up a new wallet.
B00AM5NCSU|5|Very soft. Warm and comfortable
B001D521RG|5|The mens Carhartt Quilted Lined Duck Zip- To-Thigh Bib Overall are great. the zipper work even when covered in snow, hold up well to rouged use and wash up to look new[ I hang up to dry] having long inseam lenght available is a plus as stores do not carry 36 inseam very often. The guys are able to do a days work out in the cold and stay warm.
B00NG2Y3HU|3|Hard to put on
B00GD7DGJQ|3|This isn't what everyone is saying it is, &#34;For a five year old&#34; and all. Unless you are seriously HUGE in the stomach area, you should be fine. I'm about a medium and this sweater is kind of a crop sweater, more for people who are typically smalls. Yes, the color is slightly darker but I still love it. Honestly, it's a little itchy every now and then, but what sweater isn't? Seriously, don't freak out so much people. Your over exaggerations aren't helpful. It's fine. Just made more for smaller type people.
B0010Z6QMU|2|I had been wanting the pjs but read the reviews on those that they fit very small. So last time around I got one of the men's vintage Ts, in an XL and it fit great, little snug on my belly, but being 8 months pregnant, of course it will be.  So when I saw this shirt and that they had a 4X I decided to go with that. Figured it should fit decent too, since it was a 4X. Wrong! It fits me more like a medium or large. Once I have my baby and loose the baby weight, it'll fit great. Though the size is very misleading.  Do love the print though, Pepsi just needs to learn to size things, like maybe calling these shirts not Women's, but more like Girl's or Junior's.
B00EBNOQNO|5|Love it and the price will recommend to my friends
B00J9TU0JE|5|Fresh and clean
B00FF9IT6I|5|The backpack is fantastic. All the pockets are good and it is a good size for people who are different sized.
B00MGRXZJI|5|it is the fitting tie my son loves it. I cant wait till he wears it to church next Sunday.
B00DY7UKB0|5|These socks are great. They shrank a bit in the dryer which was good. My son has little feet and even the small seemed too big before shrinking even though the size chart had him in this size.
B00KZP4Y4I|4|Very cute top.
B004LVOX4I|2|Mud pie usually runs small so I would recommend ordering a larger size than usual. The straps of this particular suit would not stay on because of the way the back is designed. I had the end up using a safety pin on the back of the suit so I wasn't fixing the straps every 2 minutes. It is also not made out of swim suit like material. Very cute looking though and great price but wouldn't recommend.
B0065V1NMM|4|Awesome price and quality my daughter love this belt but..... is TOO SMALL she usually wear Size 2 I'll try  M next time
B00IJE9G0E|5|I have two of these tops -- one in black and the other in coral.  I absolutely love both of them!!  As another purchaser mentioned they look great over a long sleeve top or a camisole; with jeans or with dress slacks.  One cannot go wrong with these tops!  They are fantastic!!
B00M2HQ5OO|2|I don't even know where to begin with this. It's basically a few pieces of material. I could have gone to the fabric store and made this. It would be too much hassle to return which is the only reason I'm keeping it.
B00VHWE3JE|4|i  love it
B001JBNDLM|1|fruit of the Loom resized mediums from 34-36 to 32-34. Website does not reflect this change
B00FX9U43Q|2|wasn't what I expected, wanted a sheer top for a cosplay outfit, this isn't fully sheer. only partially
B000N8X7Q8|2|The shoulder straps are too short on these, and of uneven length, The straps are too short for my torso, and because of the way they are stitched, they are of uneven length at full extension.
B00FRN9LDC|5|Bought this for my son's 1st Birthday party that was John Deere themed. I love it!<br />Washed it and it stayed true to it's size!
B00OS2MSOC|3|I didn't like shoulder part.It looked like football shoulders.I'm 115lbs.I bought a small and it fit me big.
B008RZWWT2|5|The fabric is really beautiful. Somehow the word &#34;fleece&#34; made me think more in terms of the polar-type fleece, but this is a looped terry-like fabric with a very soft, cuddly &#34;hand&#34;. I really wanted a warm robe and this is definitely it. The added lower back panel gives it a very special, figure-enhancing look. The soft petal-pink color is flattering. Workmanship is beautiful. All in all, I'm delighted. I checked &#34;fit as expected&#34; because I would say it runs true to size - I ordered small, the shoulders are in the right place and the fit is just right overall, so if you want it a little looser you might want to order up a size from what you normally wear. Well worth the money!
B0057X9RFY|3|I have old Dickies shirts like this from Walmart they fit great (2x Large). I ordered all 2x large but was sent 2 – 2x large and 2 – 2x tall large. The 2x regular large are a little short. I am 6’ 2” the 2x tall fit great. If your tall 6’ 2” or over 2x large shirt is a little short unlike my older ones, so you will need a tall. Other then that great shirt did not shrink much when washed and fit like a 2x in the upper body.
B005S0TF5S|3|These socks are OK for the price but are really low quality.  As some other reviewers have noted, they are really thin, fray easily, and do not breathe well.  On top of that, they are made in China.
B00AN8H6V0|5|My Dad loved it! He didn't try it on, but it appeared to be true to size.
B0056EVNYM|5|This was a great quality, well fitting t shirt.  When I put it on, I went from a puny patriot to a fearless superhero (results may vary).
B00AETR3UW|5|These scarfs are beautiful and are meant to be generous in size....  hence the name 'nomad'...because they have many uses and can acclimate to many needs depending on the user...buy it if you're a creative and bold dresser...but if you're looking for something to 'wear' you...this is not it.  I LOVE this scarf.
B001FOR45E|5|The problem I had with this style of belt was picking the right length for me, but then I did this at a store of all places. Go figure. I was hoping not to make the same mistake online. As it turns out, this time the belt I picked was just the right length, not too long as previously.<br /><br />The thing I really love about this style of belt is that you're not limited by a preset series of holes - you can make all the fine adjustments you want when tightening the belt, and in either direction. Also it looks great. The only questions is why this hadn't been thought of sooner than it was - or maybe it had been and I just hadn't heard of it before.
B0001YRYGS|5|I had oringially purchased this jacket for my husband who is a mechanic he works 2 jobs as a mechanic. He loves this jacket, he had a cheapier version of this jacket from Wal-mart but couldn't fine any more jackets like this one. unitl one day I was shopping on Amazon, and came across this replica of the Dicies Jacket it was the same color and warmth inside. I ordered it and he received it for Christmas! This was the first gift I gave him he extremly liked and had me order 2 more so he could use 2 for work and one for leisure. Thanks so much for making me and my husband extremely satisified. Thank's again! Brandy Mccoy.
B0089197P6|5|Loving them - the fit and feel are excellent and the colour came down as was expected! Will buy more of this brand again.
B00HG008S6|5|I would glady recommend this product since it fit perfectly and got it in perfect conditions as expected / Im US Medium and got a extra size and fits perfect! and kinda unique since the style is diferent considering normal wearing
B000OVB69Y|5|Great fit
B001NQJEOI|5|I am going to pull a trick on my friends and a delayed bike present is also needed. I am getting this mask so I can copy the part in The Dark Knight with the bank robbery scene. Check out my review on The Dark Knight just by clicking \\"See all of my reviews\\" next to my name. So this is the one worn by the Joker in the movie. This is made of rubber as an FYI. The one in the movie is made of hard plastic just like those Batman masks you can get for $5-$6. I hope that Mattel makes this mask of that same material and sell it for $5. No no no. I kill the bus driver. Bus driver? WHAT BUS DRIVER? I just meant to type that down. So later guys and a very late Happy Holidays.
B00GZ0OGD6|3|Pretty but way too small for the size requested. Too tiny.  Maybe make it more stretchy if you are going to make it that small
B00JH4DXWC|5|They are great!
B00M92T6X4|5|I love this top.  I ordered both the beige and black, they are perfect. Finally a perfect sleeve length that works for taller people, so tired of everything being 3/4 sleeve.  I may need to order a back-up in case anything happens to this one. Overall fit is completely flattering.
B003JXDC5U|5|My concerns when I ordered this wallet was that it would be too big. But honestly I notice it less that than my previous wallet which was 3x4 inch. I think the reason being is that it equally distribuits my cards and money. The leather looks and feels great. Retarded amazing quality. I highly recommend this wallet to everyone.
B00UG29AA8|2|this is just to long for me and cuts into my breast when I sit. I was bruised for a week after wearing it for a short time. not functional for me.
B00MA62CTE|5|I love it.  The look is just what I was going for and it is nice and soft. I will have to order another color. And I ordered on Friday and it is here on Tuesday that is so great.
B00M51QFJM|2|The dress looks like the picture. Its cute but very cheap material. The material is thin.  The order arrived on time.
B00GJ7YD06|5|Very comfortable and good support. Very pleased :)
B003A1UURO|5|Very comfortable!
B00ATC6RV0|1|Too big for the size that indicates 12M, I had to buy one for my son ... Very disappointed with the purchase.
B00HUMGZW8|1|I am always hesitant to buy pants online, and I am once again reminded why. These pants are huge on you legs, like the pants your dad used to wear. They should really change the picture for this product.
B00MK2DWUG|5|Great item couldn't be happier shipping was extremely timely
B003FVQ9RY|4|I loved the way the shirt looked and felt but it was way too small to be a medium. I gifted it to my daughter-in-law and she loves it.  Wish they offered a larger size.
B00GB819MS|4|I had the 32 DD and it was a bit small, this fits well, although I would say it runs a bit small for a DDD
B00LJ1I182|4|Nice pants
B00C6ASC4S|5|My grandson is a Dr Who fan - big time. Whenever I've bought him clothes in the past he is very gracious but never wears them. He has only had this a week and it's all I've seen him wear.
B00N6ELPY2|5|muy bueno mu bien
B00CIOEDGI|4|Would recommend this to women who are tired of form fitting skirts that are a little too snug around the waist but still want to look professional in the office.
B00KFEFHYK|4|I like it.
B00KNBHFHC|5|my husband is a fan and we actually have some free bees from wearing this......fans love Daniel.........one guy said because your a fan you get free drinks today
B00GTKZQQI|5|My daughter loves the retro look, and if you do too you won't be disappointed.  The fit and quality are very good.
B006ZU6X00|4|For the price I think this dress are beautiful, material little thin though. I habe no problem recomending to other
B001FOR2CY|1|This belt is obnoxiously wide. Not on a single pair of pants that i own does it slide through the belt loops properly. I can manage to get it through with a lot of fiddling, but I don't want to put that much effort into putting on my belt. Columbia, you had one job. Make a length of fabric that goes through belt loops to hold up pants. You failed. A ball of twine would have been a better purchase.
B00BMD3OE8|5|Great looking shirt for St. Patrick's Day and any day that you need some luck.
B004J008K4|5|My husband purchased three of these in various colors and loves them all. They fit beautifully and wash well. Colors true to photo.<br />He appreciates the lack of logo on these items!
B0050GDL82|2|These are the right size and correct quantity but unfortunately the picture isn't what you'll get. I liked these since they were more subdued colors than other toddler panty choices, and thought the nautical theme was cute. However, we ended up with a package of gaudy colored panties that were predominantly aviation motifs. It's disappointing that the photo was misleading.
B00BEYZ4LQ|4|Bought them to go with my corset and button-down top, and they looked great. Fit well in boots, no unattractive bunching. They made my ass look FANTASTIC.
B00L22LUXQ|5|I love this out fit . My body look crazy good in this . It was perfected on me
B000MQOHZQ|5|I love it so much I'm going to get me some more thinks with a Basenji on it
B004WAI1ZU|2|According to THEIR size charts, I should be a Large. I went with an X-Large, just to be safe. HOLY COW! These are barely a Medium!  Talk about incorrect sizes! These aren't even close! I gave one star for the quick shipping, and one star because the patterns were very cute.  Too bad...
B00BI1UZG4|3|Coccoli is such a french name that I was a bit shocked when the item arrived and it was made in India.  In other words, this item is being made for 3 dollars and sold for 30 dollars.  Would not have purchased this item if I had known.  It did not say made in India in the description.
B00D8E8930|3|This dress is the exact color of the picture but the length isn't as long as I hoped. I am 5'5 and the dress hits right below my knees. It is definitely tight and the material is a bit thin. All in all its not bad and a very casual dress. Nothing fancy.
B00UJ60ZZK|5|I purchased this hat for my son he seems to like it alright I can attest to the fit but he does wear it so that means something.  it also help me avoid the dreaded trip to the mall so I'm very happy.
B0018N6FGG|1|For the price, we assumed these would be made well enough to last the duration of our production of The Wizard of Oz.  They didn't make it thru dress rehearsal!<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this purchase, other than for a one-time costume party, and to be extremely careful at that, as these are very inexpensively made, sequins barely covering the shoes on thin, weak thread.  The sequins immediately came off, leaving large bare patches on the shoes the first night of dress rehearsal, and we were forced to spray them with glue and plaster red glitter over them instead, every night, twice on Saturdays!!.  We could have purchased inexpensive red shoes at PayLess and done that.<br /><br />If you want to give these as a souvenir gift for your Dorothy, to be kept in a glass case and not worn much at all, these are your shoes, at this price.  Or as I said, for a one or two time occasion, very careful not to bump or scrape on anything.  Sadly, we discovered this too late.<br /><br />I bought red sparkly &#34;Dorothy&#34; shoes for both my girls, several times when they were growing up, usually at Target or Payless.  Those shoes lasted months and months.  I don't know what else I can say.  It's a mystery to me, but not the first of this type I've had with this vendor (Ruby's).
B00MHW12XS|4|Soft but runs a little small.
B00CONNILE|2|The fit was good but the construction was not good. i thought there was more boning then 3-4 plastic boning strips and they poke your side and back which im guessing a quality product wouldnt do. Pure waste of money on this purchase!
B004BFEJZ2|5|Very good and very comfortable
B00WHPJ8ZE|5|Love this bathing suit top so much! Bottom is totally see through but I pair it with another white bottom I have. Wish it came in other colors!
B00EHX2EXC|5|I'm 5'11&#34; and 182#.  The size large fits just right.<br /><br />These things are cheap, well made and very comfortable.  Trust me, you need to get a pair maybe two.  I promise you'll wear them all the time.
B00OC35GZA|5|Love it fit just right
B005Z2LVP6|1|I dont like these, i mean you get what you pay for. It is made with cheap materials, super thin. It doesnt keep your ears warm.
B004Y8WRHI|5|Love it!
B00FQWJU2G|5|This is the second hat I purchased from buyer. Always happy with product and the shipping/packing!<br />My husband is in a band and wears this to all the gigs. The first one just got too dirty, but the shape is still great!<br />Just wanted to see him in a clearer hat. He loves it! His comment was &#34;now if I can keep the fans from taking it off my head it will stay looking like this&#34; Hahaha!
B0089F8FLE|4|Given as a gift.  Recipient said they were great and fit well.
B003U2T4ZC|5|Bought these on sale and just in time for the snowy season.  Bought them to replace my son's bibs which he outgrew last year and was a little worried about not having the body coverage of the bibs and I was afraid they would fall down.  But these fit great and were roomy in the legs so they fit great even over jeans and the waist was perfect on him.  Bought him a longer winter coat this year, so it was fine not having bibs underneath. Quality on these is great and are more water resistant than his bibs. After many trips outside this year and ice skating every week, these have held up great!
B00FRKCZM4|5|I bought this coat for my granddaughter in a size 12...the coat is made small, so i exchanged for a size 14 and it fits perfectly with a little room to spare..So if you purchase the adorable rain coat get a size bigger. Everyone that sees her in the coat wants to know where i purchased it. Its sooo cute and durable for the bad weather..<br />Love It.....
B00L9ZB1BC|5|Love my shirt and the colors. I ordered the small and  it fit perfectly, not too tight and just enough loose!
B00MA9196S|1|Very cheap and my daughter didn't even recognize the characters. Super disappointed
B00K7HBAUU|5|Great cotton fabrics.
B00EPFP8Y4|2|WAAAY too small. I've returned it.
B00AJ36WG4|4|I normally wear a medium but since it is Junior size I went to a size large and it fit well, not tight and not loose.  I wear after the gym to keep sweat off the seat in the car but also think I might wear as jacket with long sleeve tee as the weather gets cooler.  Cute hoodie.
B00IGVB2IO|4|It is too little and there is only 2 steel bones in it and that's in the front but I rigged mine up and just got longer ribbon since it wasn't that much off by the size
B0002ZRSJE|3|For the price, they are worth it. not the most comfortable khaki, but it hasn't ripped yet
B0045EIBS0|5|This is the best hat for short or long hair.<br />I have long thick hair and even I can fit it all up in my hat if I choose to.
B00KGAZ0Z4|5|Great coat, heavy weight, nips in at just the right spot  - a great &#34;fancy&#34; coat.  It runs true to size - I ordered a 5/6 originally, which was too large for my 5 year old, but the 4 fit perfectly, and she is very small for her age.  If you're wondering which of the zillion peacoats to pick this is the one I recommend (and I ordered 8 different styles/brands trying to find a good one).
B00OX7CH9S|5|Amazing fit! :D
B00HV633C8|4|Well, when you order from abroad you should know a few things. The sizing will be too small, sometimes fashion may take the place of function and color may vary. With that being said, I will give a fair review of this product.<br /><br />If you order this product then be advised. You will need to order one to two sizes bigger than you would normally wear. I am 5'11&#34; and 195 pounds. I am fit. I had to order the X-Large. The size that came fits me like a Large (slim fit). But it did fit fine. The pockets are very small. They barely fit my hands.<br /><br />If you are beyond 200 pounds and not athletic DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - IT WILL NOT FIT YOU!<br /><br />The zippers on top work. But they have no pockets behind them. They are for fashion (don't ask me why).<br /><br />When I got this item the color is darker. If you know how prismacolor markers translate color they look like a cool grey 50% instead of the cool grey 30% advertised.<br /><br />The zippers in the front are backwards to american so it does take some getting used to. But they do close and the interior looks as stylish as the picture. It is a very warm material, and does look good open or closed. The hoodie is also a short hood style. I would think it's inspired by Assassin's Creed games.<br /><br />Overall for the price and the look IT IS WORTH THE MONEY. Just be fair on how you grade your own sizes and don't try fit it based on how you think you look versus how you really are or else this will look good on a hanger.
B00EIITVD2|4|Nice hat - a little large for me, but that was easily fixed by adding a piece of fleece or felt to the inside and attaching with spray craft glue.  Looks cute!
B008AGZVFK|5|The size is good,  craftsmanship is really good, iron on process was easy, but II still hand sewed it, happy with it.
B003BSSHSU|4|its was a little bit large in my legs but still worth it against the cold weather.
B004QSL8NU|5|Yes, it's big and bulky, a lot of fabric, but boy do I feel warm and cozy after my shower, waiting for my hair to dry.
B0042LLKMA|5|Much sturdier than the natural straw and white versions of the same hat - should last a good, long time!
B00EDR31G6|2|Belt stretched and discolored (turned white on a brown belt) after only two months of use.
B0092FW77S|5|Love it -- So pleasant to have full coverage but no gaps!  Fabric is substantial but not binding.  A good buy!
B00LHTBD8Q|5|Great product for the price
B00H40QHC4|4|Very nices
B00A8EFVTS|5|They are great for the price, dry fast, and pockets held a go pro well
B00G3EGYW0|5|Luv it!
B002CMLOOK|5|I have worn these Levi's before and find they have a great fit.  The color and styling are great for dressing up a casual look.
B00ACIH0IK|4|these are very good quality underwear. they have been washed several times and they seem brand new. i definitely recommend them.
B00QGEJEKG|5|I read all the reviews about these fitting small.  And that's exactly why I bought them for my 9 year old daughter.  They fit her perfectly, as though they were made to fit a child.  I don't see these fitting most adults, certainly they would never fit me, but for her they're ideal.
B0035QP0EC|4|I usually have the problem of my shorts riding up while running, and this is just the perfect length - it doesn't even ride up that much. I think it's really the worth the money paid for!
B00P915VQS|1|cheap material
B00H6BX0U8|5|They offer great support and just enough compression for running. They are form fitting, and true to size. I like that they have a drawstring too. Very comfortable.
B00L60R9NY|5|For a new born were a little be it big but that's what you spect with a newborn never know but I thing that they are so help full
B005F29CIO|5|I like em!
B002N34GF2|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B00B2JI3N4|4|Very light but works wonderfully under a jacket. I bought a larger size as i wanted a comfy fit and the size was exactly as i wanted it(Estimated it based on the US sizes)<br />Its a polyester rayon like material(but only you would know it). No complaints, it looks wonderful.
B00852J8X0|4|Very good
B008QYILNU|5|These are for underneath my daughter's school uniform. They give her added warmth and fit perfect. I would recommend. Thanks!
B00D3H0F98|1|I hate this product.  Regardless of what the ad shows, it's the most uncomfortable thing ever.  The only reason that girl in the picture is smiling is because she is wearing it 3 sizes too big!  It feels like you're in some Medieval corset and you can't breathe.
B00GSW7NC2|5|perfect!
B00131I124|5|Lovely belt and exactly as it was described.  It is a gift and I am sure my husband will love it!
B000YSLDH2|2|This costume is cute, however it is poorly made.  The straps came unattached almost completely upon trying it on.  I sewed them back on but after wearing the costume for an hour the front straps tore as well :(.  I am 5&#34;1 and 115 lbs. Not fun to worry about your costume falling off of you because the straps broke :(
B00KI415HU|2|if  only there was a bra to come with this. my girlfriend hated it. too bad my dog like to wear it when he gets going with his female counterpart
B00IN9CVLQ|5|Great jeans 4 a great price!!!
B00NXMK6IS|1|Wife never wore.
B0020B9YTU|5|Good quality :^)
B00G49OSCC|5|great fit, great design
B0037TIDY6|5|Very good quality.  My grandson loved it.
B00KDEFGIE|5|Cool design and fits perfectly
B000WZZCU6|3|I returned because it wasn't the kind I thought it was.
B008Y0RU7O|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  Perfect5 for a smaller purse, and does not take up much room in my bag.
B00L36JKOC|5|Great fitting. NIce purchase.
B00BFWRL3G|5|Love the design of the belt.  Great addition to my Mopar and Dodge collection.  Wear it all the time! Mopar all the way!!
B00K72KW1I|4|It does fit as expected though I didn't think the outside part was going to be the same as the inside. 4 stars since I think it was my fault for not reading the description
B003ZKRFDW|5|Received - happy with the product!
B00AQ4BAQS|5|It's cute. Fits as expected.
B003BEE6SO|4|The cut and fit of this cami was almost perfect. I wanted a bra and vest combo and this fit the bill exactly. The only complaint (hence the \\"almost\\" perfect fit) is that the bra part acts as a minimizer. Not a major problem for me though, just an observation. It is comfortable to wear all day with no problems and I don't feel hot in it (and I live in the Caribbean). Great product!
B000PQGAU8|5|Perfect. Just what I wanted. Txs.
B00K4TKN18|3|Because I am a little thin, a little short (158 cm, 50 kg), although see the size table, i selected the 4 number,short, but some big,  so i return it.
B009HM2V68|3|some what small I don't like material you can see threw
B0037VLNZA|5|Great looking item
B00J3PQO5S|3|label been hand marked with different size.
B00CG6G3E8|1|This material of  this  dress it's very  cheap  don't buy it  I bought  one before was very nice  material  but this especific one its bad..Please  don't waist  your money ....I ask for my full refund
B005E1KR2Q|3|The wallet is fine.  The chain is too heavy.  A lighter chain would have been better.<br />The heavy chain kind of pulls on the pocket
B009PPZ0JM|4|The good:<br />Two layers - cotton inside so you don't itch from the wool and wool outside to keep you super warm.<br />Mostly natural material<br />I am completely warm in 40 F weather wearing a tshirt and that on top with no jacket. I bet you can drop another 10 degrees and still be okay.<br />They come in a nice package that describes the extreme loe temperature handling specs of the shirts. Great if you are planning to give it out as a gift.<br /><br />The bad:<br />They run a size large. If you normally wear an XL then order a Large, etc...<br />Blue and Gray look faded and nothing like the picture. Stick with the red or black.<br /><br />The ugly:<br />I bought a ton of these as Christmas gifts. The quality of the stitching on the collar vary from shirt to shirt. You can have two Medium blacks next to one another and one will have nice qualty tight unicolor-thread stiching around the collar and another one will look like crap. The good thing is when I bought these they were provided by Amazon so I was able to return them without paying any of the shipping costs. I returned 50% of them! So what I would do next time is order some extras so I can pick and choose the good quality ones worthy to be gifts and return all the others. This way you won't be waiting around to get your second shipment.<br /><br />Update to my review:<br />Well now I know why these are a size too big. As soon as you wash them with warm water they shrink a size. The XXL fits me right now. While the XL I bought later is now a bit tight. It would be nice if they were pre-shrunk so were all not so confused about the sizing.
B00AYYHGWM|5|excelent
B005POLLMC|4|Soft cotton, excellent price. The only thing I didn't like was that the label was scratchy and I had to remove it. I will try to find more of these in the future.
B00T2W8AZE|4|The pants came in really HUGE but I like how roomy it is and I can tighten the band around enough so it stays put haha.
B00PXSMEJO|5|These were a little bigger than expected, but that's a lot better than too small. I got them because my son was having back surgery and he had to have something loose and comfortable to wear. They are exactly the right weight -- not too heavy and hot. He finds them to be extremely comfortable. I would definitely purchase these again!
B00D2CKBL6|5|Love It!
B00EM8LKFU|4|I own this bra in peacock, 30F. I love how it looks, and it gives great shape. I look great in this. However, it's about a cup size too small. Visually, this is a very attractive bra. The lace and bow are cute touches, but they don't make it too young. I think it gives good support, as well.<br /><br />However, the straps are very wide, and they rub into my shoulders uncomfortably. The gore also goes very high. I have an issue where I get blisters from high goes, and this one has given me blisters. I think I might purchase a second of this bra in a larger size. Hopefully sizing up will get rid of the issues I'm experiencing.
B002EL2WYU|5|Good wallet ,good size. It looks very good quality. I arrived in excellent condition. very well packed. good buy. I recommend it.
B002Y42GG6|4|It is warm and great for cold wheather I love it<br />It is great to have when your ears are cold in the snow
B00F617Q4Q|4|This is serious high quality craftsmanship, beautiful leopard print design, has been a very comfortable great fitting hoodie. I am loving Southpole garments. I have already just yesterday placed an order for Southpole red camo cargo shorts, which I'm sure I will enjoy this spring and summer. No complaint's from me on this company.
B00BHLFE0C|1|The dress is the right size, but it is missing the Silver belt and character earrings. Does not come with all the parts as advertised.
B002VIXV8W|5|A Little more feather coverage would have been nice and they do fall out a bit easily, but over all very nice effect. But be carefull not to put somebodies eyes out every time you turn around ;)
B000OKZ6U0|5|These are true to size. Non-binding-no bunching. YOu feel so natural in these briefs. Yes, I would recommend to a friend.
B000UJP03I|5|A++++
B00OKWFF1S|5|These are lovely. They fit well, and they feel soft and smooth.<br />I will be buying again :)
B00SX0H7OQ|4|Quality is good, but runs a bit small.
B00FEE53ZY|5|Excellent product and fits well.
B004OVDI82|5|these are a nice soft material and at a great price for Ed Hardy items.  They run a little small.  my guy wears a med to large.  I ordered a large and they are a little short and a snug fit int he waste.
B00ACIHDT6|4|These aren't the best quality boxers but are much better than the cheap Hanes / Fruit-of-the-loom offered at Walmart. They are much more comfortable and are much better quality. They also seem that they won't get tissue paper thin after a couple of washes like the cheap store bought ones.
B00CXJOC0U|4|This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves it, said  pajamas are cuddly soft.  I did get the large instead of medium and they fit perfectly.
B0073MLZ70|5|This wallet is very nice, I love all the card holding room it has! It's very good quality, and a great price vs buying it at a big box store!
B007YFEFDW|4|I'll be wearing for the annual Turkey Trot.  Should draw some attention :-)  My only negative was that the turkey's neck was folded when packaged so, he couldn't hold his head up.  I cut a small hole in the base of the next, inserted 5 coffee stir sticks and stitched him back up.  Much better!
B0032ZMCLU|5|Excellent Rare Eminem T-Shirt- wow what a bargain, authentic product, quick shipping, good communication from seller. no one else has this t-shirt. does not shink or lose its logo after being washed. perfect sale.  Thank you Amazon for promoting \\"Shockhound\\" on your site!
B00DR72J52|5|Great quality. I got this scarf for my niece for Christmas because she loves Manchester United. She was thrilled with it.
B001E510MM|3|I absolutely love it! I read reviews on everything before I order so I was expecting it to be a little tore up when it got here. I am pretty handy with a needle and thread so I decided to have a Crack at it! I have little tatas so I cut up aN old bra and sewed it into the front of the the top to give more support and not feel so naked I also used the same clasp from the bra and sewed that onto the straps where the velcro was. It isn't very great at staying together without the clasp haha and the top part ties like a bikini but Im going to sew a clasp onto that as well<br /><br />The skirt was a disaster the 3 PLASTIC pieces were all sewed on the right hip not the front center so I just resewed then in place after I cinched the front secton in a little more because it covered waaay too much. I'm going to cut the shorts down to a thong soon. But that's just because I'm comfortable with my body. All in all I spent about 3 or 4 hours redoing everything.<br /><br /> The colors all matched on mine and the choker fit right it just had a smaller chain than the pocture. And the arm band was too big I still have to re sew the velcro for that as well. But once you give it a little tender lovin' it Is super comfortable, I felt very sexy in it! I just can't figure out what to do with the head pieces.. haha  I'm about a size 5 in pants and I have a b cub. The small fit perfectly with my added bra cushion to perk the girls! I love it and I so does my star wars boy fantasy fulfilled boyfriend. ;)
B00896PHXC|4|Great for my husband to wear to work. I think if you wore them casually and did a lot of walking, they might not hold up as well, but perfect for office use.
B000JC0YJQ|3|Perfect around the house shorts!
B00F3ZMXOS|5|I would recommend this to anyone...fits well, comfortable and &#34;in&#34;.  I'm glad I purchased there capris and would definitely buy them again...
B0009HN7OU|5|Comfortable and still good looking.  They last forever, I think they're nearly indestructible and the only panties I've tried that have everything I'm looking for.  I ordered a bit larger than I should so check your sizing.
B00GR785Z2|5|Love this jacket! Well tailored with zips for tightening, zips over face when hood is up with soft fabric that touches face.
B0051U18KA|5|Good quality socks. Great fit and wearability.
B000LZ0PQS|5|This is a great product, it fits my 13\\" MacBook perfectly, snugly and provides a nice layer of protection for it. It is also very stylish! The sleve doesn't add hardly any bulk, my computer still fits easily into my purse or book bag. Maybe the only downfall to this product would be the price-- $35 seemed to be a bit steep compared to similar products ($20-$25), but in the scheme of protecting a computer that costs $1500, it's still quite minimal and this little number is definitely more stylish than many others (I really love the black to go with my black MacBook.)
B0058ZYBJS|5|I purchased these for my boyfriend who is very slender and 6'4. The fit was perfect for his body type and the wash on the jeans looks great. I would recommend.
B00C6PWHOE|1|I was really sad at how small this was I would order it one to two sized larger.
B00FS4CA9W|4|The flower on shirt hangs weird after three or four washings.  The dress bottom is like Velcro and sticks to things.  Cute but little peculiarities.
B000G7MUUA|5|Aesthetics are fantastic.  Was told they are comfy.  I don't know if I've ever seen a sexier stocking . . really.
B00FRAOS7O|5|very nice ties
B0019GNH3Q|4|Some of the reviews I read said the shirt runs small but it does not.  I wear a Large, went by the review advice and ordered the XL, It was huge on me. Like the design but need to get a large like I normally wear
B00BJM4BD0|5|This shirt is perfectly fitted.  True to size.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice (cool) shirt to play sports in.
B0093KU36Y|1|i wish I had the chance to were this top I ordered it because of all the great reviews, I love skulls and they sent me a totall opposite all lace with bows not me at all. very disapointed. I was so ready to go rock it this weeekend.. and I have to pay to ship back the wrong item they sent me ..
B004HO6K72|5|PRO. These pants need very little break-in to feel comfortable. 32\\" is pretty true.<br /><br />CON. No left side back pocket, but the extra cargo pockets make up for that.
B009VLWXO0|5|It looks very nice. The quality is good and I like the texture. It's also functional with multiple card slots. I would recommended it to others.
B001AXUBDM|5|Love it!  Looks and fits great!  I recommend.
B00JPAGTKG|4|I like the cloth but after I washed thenT-shirt was to small for me I recommend to buy a large or xl
B00LI979VK|5|It's a really one size fits all size.  I'm a bit on the smaller side and this fit me perfectly without looking too bulky, but I could also see it fitting someone who has a bigger size than me as well
B0030BG7DU|5|great !
B007RW2FF2|5|I tried several strapless bras (including from my favorite bra line, Fantasie) but none were as good as this one.  It's not like I'm going to be doing cartwheels while wearing it (and I can't do them anyway) but I did try dancing in it and moving my arms around, sitting, standing, walking and the bra didn't shift and everyone stayed where they belong.  It's not exactly pretty, but it isn't hideous either and as long as it does the job, that's OK with me.
B00GMJ6Q8S|2|I did not like them they kept riding up above my breast.
B0052I16OO|5|I was a young man when I picked out one of these jackets that were first introduced by Levi Strauss & Company. The jackets themselves weren't all that popular since they sold for about three dollars more than a pair of $5 501s. In fact, most of the ones I saw had the sleeves removed, and there was a reason for that. Without the sleeves these jackets become more wearable as a vest, and I can't figure why Levi's doesn't just supply them as such. But anyway, it was discovered long ago that these jackets would not fit everyone, and removing the sleeves would work a little magic with them, making them wearable by the Average Joe. No, these jackets are built for people with a thin frame and who probably have longer arms than normal, and not for those of us with an average stocky build, or who might even be a little bit pudgy. Sizing up doesn't help because you are likely to feel like you have just donned some sort of cardboard harness after struggling to get it all buttoned up. Thus, my original Levi's jacket is still dark indigo and it is still rigid after all these decades because unlike the jeans that I am always wearing, this jacket saw very little use over the years and was seldom ever removed from the closet.<br /><br />There are some differences in these newer versions of the jacket even though this particular model is still designed for the thinner guys. Most significantly, more colors are available than just the Indigo Blue of the original. Two lower outside pockets have been added, and two more are available inside. Also, there are now several versions of the Trucker Jacket, and I even saw one with a pocket on one of the sleeves. Levi's supplies them with flannel or Sherpa liners, some have hoods, and others have knit collars, and there are now even some leather versions in this style. So with such a variety available, I'm sure a little searching can reveal one that is suitable. Obviously these jackets maintain a popular following because they are well put together and amazingly durable jackets that have a style that will probably never die, but I'm not one of those fortunates who can wear one, so I'm a little reluctant to purchase another because I just don't want to be bothered with another that won't fit correctly.<br /><br />The other difference is that denim jackets are now available from several other popular jeans suppliers. Wrangler probably has the biggest variety, and their jackets provide lots more room for us average folks that have a normal build and who prefer wearing them with sleeves in place.azingly durable jackets that have a style that will probably never die, but I'm not one of those fortunates who can wear one, so I'm a little reluctant to purchase another because I just don't want to be bothered with another that won't fit correctly.

B00PBFYUDC|5|I am 5 feet tall, 120 lbs fit perfect, well made love them
B00S9I2ZDA|4|Very comfortable socks, I stand all day at work and these soft socks feel great.
B008EWPEA2|5|I ordered this pin a few days ago to go with a plush cthulhu doll I have.  It was larger than I expected, and seems to be well made.  It is a very nice button.  Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
B00NCAF75I|2|Poor quality - had to throw them out after first time I wore them.  Spend a few more dollars and get some that are durable and better quality.
B00CC6ZQFY|3|It's a cute outfit the material isn't great. My daughter doesn't even like to where it long because the material just is kinda scratchy and rough.
B00CS7DVHW|5|Great Socks! Perfect fit, not too bulky. Comfortable with my flip flops & regular shoes. I'll be back for more!
B00795E5F0|5|This is a very cute satin dress.  My 9 year old daughter purchased it with some birthday money.  The color is true to what you see on the website.  It is true to size.  No larger or smaller than the size indicated.  Therefore, if you want to have some room to grow into it, I would suggest ordering up a size.<br /><br />Nice soft material even the lining.  No scratchy parts, as my daughter likes to say.
B008BZTYO4|5|Excellent!  &#34;All that, and a Bag of Chips&#34;
B00NM85JJY|1|I was VERY disappointed with this purchase. It didn't even come with a clip for the rest of the wig and it was very tight and I have a big head so I couldn't even get it on. Not a good purchase. Sorry.
B00E0IYFBI|5|These are great! I wear them under my dress pants since I work in a cold office and they are perfect.  I wash these with my other clothes and have had no problem.
B0050JLBOU|5|Great shirt!!
B00BG5D7DA|5|This suit is true to the size.  My son is 5 and I purchased a 6 so he'll haev one more year in it.  I took it to the cleaners to get it hemmed (not cut).  It looked AMAZING on him.  :)<br /><br />Love it!
B000686I6G|4|I was really pleased when with the quality of the robe. The cuffs had double thickness, and there was a patch of double thickness at the back of the neck too for wet hair (a nice detail), and the robe in general was very thick and heavy. For me, it was almost too thick, and felt a little like wearing a winter coat. This is what I thought I wanted so I definitely got that, but after I tried it on I realized I wanted something more soft and pliable for indoor use. I think this would be great for use outdoors at like a hot tub (probably the warmest robe I've seen). I couldn't even wear it inside for very long because I was overheating.  I was pleased with it, like I said, and I would have kept it except there was one other thing not quite right for me which was the fit. I'm 5'2\\" ~195lbs, and I'm a bit bigger in the middle. The OSFM did fit me, and I could wrap it with 5 inches overlap (or so, maybe more), but it did not wrap enough to make me feel comfortable in front of company. I really wanted a little more overlap, and because I am so short I did not want to order a bigger size and have it drag on the floor (and the sleeves were already too long for my short arms--but not a problem for me because I rolled them).  It did come to my ankles.  Overall a good product, I would have given 5 stars except I did end up returning it when I found a softer/lighter one that fit better at a local store. Great customer service and return went through without a problem. I did have to pay the return shipping (because I am in Canada) which was around $30 I think, and I didn't get a refund on the original shipping, just the product price. I didn't mind too much about the shipping loss because it was sorta my fault, I ordered a huge thick robe which was what I thought I wanted but then ended up wanting something thinner... but be warned, it is thick, like wearing a jacket indoors.
B00385XMFO|5|Looks good, feels good, smells good.
B00E0IYG6M|5|I love the fit of these. I'm 5'10&#34; and 165 lbs and they're very high-waisted while still covering my ankles. I almost think I could have gone down a size (I got a large) because they slide down and bag a little, but I find them otherwise very comfortable. They seem to be dark enough that I don't need to worry about flashing undies when I bend over, too.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have three extremely cuddly cats with their claws intact, and they've made the material &#34;pill&#34; where they knead their claws. It's not too bad and not the manufacturer's fault, obviously, but it makes me think pilling is going to happen with regular wear over time, too. I still ordered two more pairs so I can swap them out. :)
B002FU62SM|4|Nice pants, warm and well made. These run small.  I ordered my normal size 10 (and sometimes I wear 8,) but had to return and exchange for a 12 because they were too snug in the hip area. Recommend ordering up one size.
B008EM7TJQ|5|We put this shirt on our 13 month old to announce to the family that we were expecting again. It was perfect! At first glance it just looks like a train; then someone looks closer and reads it out loud! So much fun!!!
B0069KJ9ZM|5|Well-fitting and flattering.  Relatively high-waisted.  Have held up after months of wearing and washing.  Stretch helps the fit, but does not bag or cling.
B00ESMW5EU|5|Actually it's for my grandaughters birthday the end of the month. I do think it will fit fine, I found adorable purple shoes to match and I can't wait to see her in it.
B003LA7ZP4|5|These shorts are super. They are really short and low rise. They barely cover my booty and the bulge presentation is outstanding. I went running in them this week. The price is better than other locations. I'm going to get every color.
B005QRRFAU|4|I love my insulated bag on wheels and I just love my wheels. I have used it for a smaller bag when I don't need the bigger one. Just throw my ice packs, drinks and lunch in and I am set for the day. I have a lot of compliments on my bag/wheels too. Everyone must know where I found it.
B004QF0TG0|5|Perfect
B0063BDSNQ|4|Only issue I have which is my own fault for not looking more closely is that it is bigger than I expected as far as width goes. But overall it is a nice lookin wallet and sturdy.
B0073AFCZI|4|Ordered this hat for my 16mo old for our trip to Mexico. It was great, but my son could still pull the hat off even with the clasp right under his chin.
B00K0ZJTT8|4|A little larger than expected but very comfortable and good quality
B00IB2YPA0|5|I was worried when I purchased this tie but I was pleasantly surprised. It is a very nice tie.
B00L8LQH5W|1|I loved the look of this dress. So cute. Wrinkles a little when you wear it. But on my first wearing a small snag and the fabric was so delicate it ripped a 4 inch gash in it. Did not even get a full days wear out if it. So bummed out.
B00ATM1NNM|5|Ties are in great condition and of good quality. The delivery was quick, too. I will certainly be getting more in the future.  Thanks a bunch.
B00OHI7CQG|5|It fits perfectly and its so soft!!!
B00M6SM9FS|5|Not only does the shirt fit as expected, but the material is super nice.  A very good quality comfortable shirt, and it's one of her favorite shirts to wear now.  :)
B008LWSBAK|3|Excellent work shirt, could be worn as a casual shirt. Good looking shirt. Just fits small for a 2x
B00EASZ1UM|5|Handsome sweater
B007OSHNGA|5|nice
B007P0G5UW|5|Not many others make a 32L 29W.
B000RGL48Y|5|Sigo en concordancia con mucho de os comentarios, me compré la talla 38D y a pesar del volumen de mis senos, ellos están firmes todo el día. Una excelente compra. Lo único malo es que el gancho de los breteles es dorado!! pero no los usaré, no es necesario.
B000JCOBE0|5|This is a great product for an amazing price! My husband is very pleased with this purchase (gift). It fits very well and it is of good quality.
B0007VDN2O|5|This was exactly what I was looking for. A boonie hat with a smaller brim and buttons on the side for a cowboy hat look when the sun is down. Medium size was perfect for my 7 1/4 head.
B000I3EIPW|4|Really lovely and soft. Wish it had a wee bit of padding.
B00M2ZI2Y2|1|Plastic cheap itchy material. Does not deserve a rating.
B00HR8RT20|2|Like the shirt but my XL is skin tight. I'm always wear XL but I'm not even sure a 2X would work for me.
B00G6OTSCK|5|This sweater is acrylic, so it's not itchy.  The colors are vibrant,will go great with skinny jeans and boots.  Pretty cute .
B005SXYEKQ|3|This product works very well when using touch screen devices.  The only downside was that they are cheaply made and we have had to sew some of the seams
B00OSDERU4|5|This shirt was absolutely perfect. The print was great, good quality, and fast shipping! Thanks for making such an awesome product!!
B000S9LZTS|5|I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and it was expected to come between Nov. 29th and Dec. 14th and it arrived November 23rd. Needless to say...I was very happy. I ended up giving it to him early so he can wear it for Thanksgiving, he loves it. I am glad it came early and it is really nice looking, for sure worth the price.
B00O6EXXEG|3|These are cute but because they run kind of small, they don't stay up the way I wanted them to.
B004CJ0PK0|4|Excellent quality and my grandson (6) says they are comfortable.  Have held up well to washing, no shrinkage so far and have not faded.  Size is true and you can order with confidence.
B00COGQYNK|1|Beautiful Color sad to say the sizing is very wrong! The top fit perfect !!! Bottoms would have fit a child not a women and I ordered a size up so I am very pissed off! I actually ordered 3 suits from amazon all ordered a size up and none of them fit due to the sizing and do we really need all that padding? I am a natural 36 dd padding 2 inches deep is the last thing I need!!! Very disappointed as I am a size 6
B00IGHBS3M|1|Returned it definitely run very small.
B00R25FODY|3|Nice vest, but need to order two sizes bigger
B00HHOL9W0|5|Love the style. Light weight and warm. I fit in xs somehow. I'm 5'6 120 and have hips. Looks better when I unzip hip zippers because a bit snug there. I live in nyc and people on the street notice this coat. Warm for zero degrees. Huge hood is great. I feel like a warm turtle in there!!!
B00KRCGA3W|5|GREAT PRICE AND VERY WARM
B00KAW0VLQ|5|Love the jacket, washes fine in machine, and has a very handy pocket inside that holds books well.
B001RNO4EW|5|good shirt!
B00INIG8XO|4|30*32, pants is a little big long。
B0087UH814|1|This took a few weeks to come first of all, which was disappointing because by the time it actually arrived I didn't have time to order a different shell bra. Once it came it looked different than the picture shown. It looks more like a white plastic coconut bra than seashells. Didn't even end up using it for my mermaid costume. Shipping is expensive for such a small item too. Don't waste your money!
B00L1KQCRI|5|Love this dance wear, will order from this seller again!!
B000PQKY7S|5|Fits my small head perfectly.
B004GXA732|4|Perfect!
B00JZQG68A|5|F'n fantastic hat!  Understated yet bold, this can go with just about anything.  Love the fabric.
B000H46E22|5|Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.
B0087H88UW|3|Is the real one the 9fifty if yes please just put a comment under this I ill check it latter
B00D1I680Y|4|Fits like a glove, well the panties are a little too big, even when I ordered a small, but it still looks nice. I know it says 3 piece set, but I was still kinda hoping the stockings came with it. They don't. Still, super cute. My favorite part of it is the Open bra bikini.
B003G8TQW6|5|Great craftsmanship, beautiful design. I love it!
B00CIZLCN4|2|no lining. Very light jacket not the best
B00ARH92OG|5|this made my week.  Best shorts I've ever owned.  no kidding.  I need to pick up another pair
B00BMAT2R4|5|Really good for travel.  Light-weight, easy care, non-wrinkle fabric.  I did not find this skirt to be too &#34;see through&#34;, as mentioned in another review.
B008HZ6X6K|1|I was not pleased with this bra at all.  After years of wearing underwire bras, I decided I would try this bra because of its rating and the amount of support it was suppose to have without the wire.  No support of the breast or the side panels at all.  I want to send them back.  The bra fit over the shoulders and around the body.  48D is the correct size in this way.  I would not recommend this bra, especially to someone that has had the support and lift that an underwire bra provides.
B000P50WGC|4|T-Shirts was what I expected
B00812108A|2|The reviews said one should be mindful of the size, not to order too small, so I ordered XL. Its HUGE. The material is an unpleasant cotton.<br /><br />I bought lots of T-shirts in my life but this one is a total disappointment. I am not returning it as the postage fees are too high and the Tee was only 10.95, so I will keep it but never wear it.
B00F13NABC|1|Didn't fit good at all really short
B006SFSAB2|4|I am so enjoying my Brushed Back Crew Shirt, and Bottom. I walk my dog in an open field here in Michigan, and I have been<br />so cold. Now I can face even the worst winds, and still be comfortable.
B004RFJM62|3|I liked it @ 1st but its a ltl deep (one sz fits all) maybe in mens world, keeps falling down over my eyes. I just washed in washer (air dryed) & the seam on outer edge of apron frayed about 2 inches worth. I expected it might not last too long after use in the pool, but I only swim 3 times a week & i've only worn it 5 days in the pool on warmest days. I @ least thought it would last 90/3 mo.s worth in the pool.
B00SLHN3SA|5|So so soooooo cute these look better than on the picture , the colors are deeper and the cape on the back is totally creative and different !
B00F064N70|1|I am really happy about the design and the color but was totally unhappy about the size. I wear US Large and it specifically said to go for  XXL(China Large) which I did. The hands are too short and the whole jacket is tight. I also had to wait for a month to get this which was very annoying.<br /><br />If you are planning on getting one, please always get one size greater than the one mentioned in the list.
B00NL3PMI8|3|I ordered the shirt to go swimming with. It was to be a xxx large but it was like a med
B000FBYHHG|3|I ordered XS since I use XS scrubs but the warm-up jacket is too big.  It would be nice if they offered smaller sizes since the sizes run big.
B00A1G8IPM|4|Excellent material but it&#34;s a little baggy.
B00LRIES5W|5|Order DOWN. It comes large, but does it dirty.
B00F45RIZ6|4|The only thing I dislike about this hat is that I have to double roll the band because otherwise it's pretty slouchy. Other than that it's a good quality and very warm hat.
B007FVVAJM|4|The coat is what I expected for the price the fit is snug but usable would have went one size bigger
B001VZADXC|4|I am very happy with my purchase. I read the feeback left by others and ordered accordingly; I am 5'9 and saw another who ordered this was also and said that a large was too tight so I ordered the x-large and couldn't be happier.  The dress was knee length for me and fits great.  I am usually a size 8 or medium and an x-large worked so take note that this dress does run very small when ordering.
B00H8OWAJ0|5|I love this dress. It makes a great work dress. I received many compliments on it from those who thought it was from a more expensive store.
B002QREFKG|5|Great belt!  I've had it for two years now, and the elastic is still as good as ever!  Keep in mind that there are no holes for the prong on the buckle, so the prong becomes a bit loose after extended usage.  Also, the strap to hold the end down is secured too close to the buckle for my taste, but I've learned to live with it.
B00DJ5H7FY|3|The quality is NOT as expected. But it looks nice!!
B00EJTY716|5|Excellent quality and brilliant colors. Very comfortable on the baby. Very fancy too.<br /><br />The fabric are very soft and it's easy to handle
B004UUK61O|1|I bought this ring for my husband's Halloween costume.  It didn't light up, it was too big and it wasn't as nice as the ring that we actually ended up using for the costume.
B00DGPHHES|4|I have a petite little girl and this was super small on her. I already washed it so I cannot return it. Bottom line order a a size up.
B00MFL4SUU|3|They arrived quickly and look good. The waist is just right but the length is about 12 inches to long.
B009BFTRMM|5|This dress is cute and beautiful. It more than met my expectations. Excellent quality. It arrived on time. I would recommend this item to anyone looking for beautiful formal attire for their little girl.
B007YXN9KO|5|Love the shirt.  It's gotten lots of comments.  Good quality, and it arrived when expected.
B00EIRQ9Z6|5|Great scarf at a great price.  It looks exactly as pictured, and seems to be of good quality.  I love it.
B00QTFEOES|1|I wish I could give negative stars, I ordered a small, I'm 5ft2in 98lbs. When it arrived I tried it on and although the tag says small it is obviously an XXL. It's so big that the straps and beast of the dress are at my belly button. Mean while the width of the dress is about three feet. I don't know anyone that large to even give this &#34;dress&#34; too (and yet somehow it's still too short?)
B006950WQW|5|Was worried that these wouldn't fit through the belt loops on my jeans but worked just fine. Also worried that they would be a little bulky and awkward, but actually worked pretty well. If you're looking for a traditional styled belt -- this is not for you, but if you're looking for something a little off the beaten path, then it's definitely work a try.
B0037T2TS2|5|This shirt is an absolute work of art. People love this shirt, and I've literally had to ward off some people trying to rip it off my own back... BEWARE, jealousy is a powerful emotion. Flaunt this shirt all around town and you'll be a hero. No complaints about it whatsoever.. I was skeptical at first because $15-$20 for a shirt is a lot in my book, but it's worth every penny. Enjoy it!
B005SN5I4M|5|i ask what my spouse wanted or needed for Christmas and he sd t shirts and wanted some boxers so i did
B00OTTRE3Y|5|Fits great, love it.
B00JV5XSEK|5|Great product and nice material.
B00AFJLEZQ|5|Good Quality T shirt
B00M8RHN12|4|My grand daughter loved them
B00FB3B5SW|5|This is a gorgeous top to wear under a sweater.  Note:  It is quite long--tunic length and it is even longer in the back.  I'm a petite so I am choosing to have it altered.  Otherwise it hangs out of even my longest sweater. It can go with jeans of dressier pants.  Love it.
B003A7W9YU|3|I just got these shorts for lifting and boxing. Like everything Rival makes, the quality is excellent. Comfortable, relatively thick jersy cotton material, excellent stitching, and good looks. Well, good if they fit better. The waist is fine.<br /><br />I usually wear a size medium in athletic shorts as I am 5'7\\" with a 32\\" waist, but if I had been able to try these on first I would have bought a large. If you are a wiry little person with a basketball player build they may be fine, but for me, being a lifter that has fairly large thighs the legs and butt are ridiculously undersized. Even if I wasn't a lifter they would be too small for working out.<br /><br />You need to be aware that these are NOT a relaxed fitting pair of shorts like most athletic shorts are. I usually wear the old school nylon or polyester mesh shorts, and the mediums in those shorts are fine as the legs have about 1-1/2 times the room that these do. I would compare these to biking shorts, albeit cotton ones.  I am considering seeing if any of the other boxers I train with would like them cheap as, if they actually fit a person properly, they are VERY nice shorts. If you are towards the upper end of the size scale, like me, I would definitely consider ordering a size up however.
B00MB40S4Q|4|Nice dress. Fit as expected but in bigger size was not as cute as if on a smaller person.
B00KYH9VHC|4|love the item, but it runs small so I wish I had ordered a large size.  But still like the item
B009YK046M|5|These run small as all the other reviews mention. So I was expecting it to so I ordered a D. Which is funny cause I am more like a B/C cup. However, it is an awesome product. It takes a little practice to get it to lift natural boobs but once you master it you are going to be thrilled with the results. Looks like a boob job in you tops and I have 48 year old boobs. :)
B001D6CRK6|1|sizing seems to be off. I ordered an 18 and it is very small. I am still loosing weight so I am hoping to get into them soon.
B00I6MCLRE|5|Right now, the hordes that follow George Takei are trying to produce the ultimate review... that is the only explanation for such a small number of reviews.<br />The fit is larger than life.<br />The fabric is smooth as baby's bottom.<br />I wonder what John Malkovich thinks about this shirt.
B000O9TNQO|5|I bought them for my husband and he likes them a lot. They fit well and seem to be good quality.
B004V4P2KY|5|The show is my favorite will be ordering episodes soon got one set for me and one for my husband
B00UD969VW|5|These are a perfect fit & look great on me!
B001BADU82|5|I wanted a nice pair of cufflinks that didn't look like something an old fart would ware because I am Master Mason and in my 20's.  These Cufflinks are sharp and all the other Masonic Brothers (even the older ones)  want their own set now.  Great product and I highly recommend them to all Freemasons.
B00ARDCFHG|3|I bought these in preparation for my little one's arrival.<br />Pros: These mittens are well-made, soft, and great for protecting a newborn from scratching his/her face. The elastic is just right for staying on the baby's hands without cutting off circulation.<br />Cons: The mittens were roomy brand new, but shrunk quite a bit after the first wash/dry. They fit my son (born at 8lbs3oz, 21 in) for the first couple weeks, but then were too short to continue to use - he could not fully open his hands/extend his fingers in them. My son is a bit larger/longer than the average newborn, but I think a size 0-3 mo should have fit him at least through 3 weeks.<br />Overall, I think these are very nice mittens that should fit an average/small newborn throughout the face scratching stage; another brand may be better for larger babies.
B00HU6URMS|4|Girdle type shirt. Thank goodness I know how to pop a bra loose with one hand this has enough hooks to build five to six DD/EE cup bras on one side only. It is possible to hook all the hooks before stepping into and pulling this thing on. Not uncomfortable and like the adjustable hooks
B00M2C7VVU|4|Love this bathing suit. I followed their instructions on the fitting and had to get a bigger size then I normally would wear. I'm 5'1 and 145lb and got an XL. It's a tiny loose around my upper waist, but nothing bad. I got it in a week.
B000OV90OC|5|wonderful!!!!! Exactly what I wanted when I ordered it. Came very quickly and I am very satisfied with my purchases. I actually recommended these to my coworkers
B001PO54Q0|4|This shirt fits really well (I am a AUS size 12) - not too tight, well tailored at the shoulders and is a good length.    It doesnt shrink on hot wash and the shirt in Lemon Juice colour is true to the picture
B004NINTGM|5|Great product! Just as described!
B00AMC8U80|4|Good!
B00NNEDJDU|5|But she's short so it's aye tad long and she hasn't wore it yet it's her birthday outfit thanks so much
B00EX4LGG6|1|They send me a totally different bathing suit blue bottom and white top so disappointed. I'm Not buying here anymore!
B00FITPRCE|5|My daughter loves these pjs except they are very very large on her and long as well.  Nice flannel material
B002ZU9K7M|5|I bought this for my Dad for Father's Day. It was the perfect gift for the man who has everything.
B00K6SDZGM|5|Fast delivery, high quality -- thanks!
B00WM3P2CY|4|These are really nice, soft tank tops.  I bought them to sleep in, so I ordered a large, which usually fits slightly big.  However, this were really loose.  Since I'm sleeping in them it doesn't matter, but I would probably order a small if I wanted a clingier fit (I wear 6-8 on top, 36B)<br /><br />The navy is really faded navy, which I love.  If you're looking for dark navy this isn't it.<br /><br />The white is very thin and see through. Still very soft, but doesn't leave much to the imagination.
B00IUOROPW|5|Fits like a charm! Color in picture online is true in person. The fabric is soft and reasonably stretchy and seems to be well made. This is my boyfriend's favorite dress on me because it hugs my curves in all the right places ;)
B000N3XA2E|1|I wanted to like these for a lightweight summer dress pant but returned them because the shiny fabric and cost-cutting construction make them look cheap.  They are not suitable for wearing to work.  The $65 list price is absurd; if you don't mind shiny, poorly made pants then they might be worth $25.
B002QB0UZG|1|The shirt looks nice and the price is reasonable, however it shrunk significantly after it's first wash.  I have no idea why this shirt would be any different than any of my other brands when it comes to laundering.  The neck probably went from a 17 down to a 15, and I can't even wear it.
B00JHDBXUW|5|Excelent deess,
B00D7UX1YM|5|This wallet was purchased for around $10.  I received it in a matter of days, complete with that fresh leather smell that only a quality wallet can provide.  I'm actually surprised at how nice it is; definitely a great wallet for the price!
B003BDPYLI|4|Looks great but sheds a lot.  Be prepared to shake it outside or in the trash before use.
B00CKKW36C|3|I ordered the long sleeve shirt in the largest size the offered (US XL) I'm 6'1&#34; and 190 lbs but I have 34&#34; arms. The body fit well enough but the sleeves didn't even make it to my wrists. If you have long arms like me do not order this shirt in long sleeve!
B00JQEBL22|5|Super cute my 6year old loves it
B00551P946|5|I like the bras, especially when my wife doesn't wear them. But she told me they are the same as she normally buys from local store but for a more reasonable price. The store prices for bras is outrsgeous. They are priced out of line because they know women must buy them, so I say more power to Amazon.
B002MGF9T2|5|The gloves are exactly what I needed. The color and fit are perfect.
B005I33OWU|1|They're warm as long as you don't get them wet. Unfortunately, the waterproof claim fails pretty quickly. The liner also isn't removable, so even if they get wet and you figure you'll throw the liner in the dryer to dry them out, no luck. They stay wet for a long time because you can't easily air/dry them out.
B004TVIQG6|5|I am so happy with this dress, is so elegant...the bonnet, color, wreath, every detail...is just perfect! and shipping took only 2 days! Thank you...my niece will look so adorable!
B00INGAC5G|5|Gorgeous details make this petite but big on style hat a winner!  Beautifully made with exquisite details!  Highly recommend for ladies of style.
B0029YBPKY|5|Very cute, stylish hat.  Great with jeans.
B00KCYN77W|4|It feels somewhat small, but has good quality and feel.
B00943CZZW|5|I bought this for my boyfriend who loves South Park, he loved it, we were both happy. Exactly what I thought it would be! :)<br /><br />Kacey
B00JD9QDY6|4|Good i guess
B008RPMOZE|5|Love it!
B003ZJKLQ6|5|Jeans have usually been on the baggy side for me, but these fit well.  I have short legs with large thighs, but a small butt.
B00801T6CY|5|great fit (for me), and great color. Don't feel like Mom jeans. Comfortable and soft, which is not true of many of the dyed colorful jeans. As far as the fit, I am junior-y with some hips. size 2 in Gap..size 5 in these fit great.
B00ENE9AT6|1|This hat looks like a brown mess. So can someone  please give the address so I can return this item.  it's in the beg never opened.  thanks
B00FNREXK8|5|Super cute and my daughter loves them.
B00DV1KYK6|4|She loved it.
B00NIN1KJG|4|It's a great holiday sweater for nerds
B001FAYNJ8|3|Cute hat,great color, but my head is normal size and it is a bit tight. I still wear it though
B007PSEF6U|5|Soft and substantial fabric that is v comfy but the fabric is heavy so that it gets longer and narrower on the body when you wear it. Feels so nice and cool on the skin and doesnt bind anywhere. As noted here elsewhere, the pockets are weird! I sewed them shut and cut them off since who needs pockets when they sleep? wth? I dont baby them, I wash them in the washer in cold water and line dry them and they are holding up beautifully. They seem well made and feel soft and smooth when Im sleeping. Comfort is the main thing for me.<br />The color green is totally strange tho and I wish they came in something more pretty like pink/rose combination, something pastel instead of brights!
B0031U0PRY|4|Good belt, havnt had it too long so I'm not sure about the ware and tear which is a huge concern when shopping for belts. Feels like good quality. Would recommend.
B004SWGN16|5|Really good fit but super long
B00QMR1JP0|5|Best socks I have ever owned. The color pattern is really fun, the quality of the materials and craftmanship is amazing. They're in a league of their own. Fit is really nice, and they hug the top of my calf (without pinching) and stay up nicely. They feel really good on my feet. And its just a lot of fun to glance down at your ankles every so often and see this bold pattern winking back at you.<br />They're made in the USA in small batches - what craft brewing is to beer, these guys are to socks!
B0007V9TYU|5|The guys love this hat and use it for fishing always. Nice colors and quality!
B004WSD7NI|4|Good
B0027IYWKC|1|Take a pass on this one, Ladies. It's junk. Extremely poor construction. Love Fifi's items are much better quality. I won't try another brand again.
B00KCXGF18|4|I am returning these because I found a pair on sale at Coolibar that is cheaper.  (Coolibar is usually so expensive - that it's hard to believe, but it's true).  I am a curvy size 14 & ordered the XXL - and they are just a little too big.  They look small out of the package, but have tons of stretch.  There are perfectly acceptable, and if I end up actually swimming more frequently - I will come back to buy these in an XL.  The quality seems good, fit is good, although I have long legs (5'8&#34;) and these were just barely long enough.  I usually find the &#34;amazon&#34; fit chart to be off on certain brands of clothing (especially Asian made) - but for this company, I would say the amazon chart is pretty accurate.
B008OFYBJ4|5|love this top!!fabric silky and very soft against skin.  beautiful pattern.  true to size . fits beautifully. well worth the $$
B00UPCX8ES|5|Great product, good fit and seems to hold up on our toddler son!
B005IDI25Y|5|Met all my expectations! Picture does not do this hat justice. If you are looking for a great looking, comfortable Irish Flat Cap, look no further. Great service and prompt delivery.
B005KGL1H0|3|I bought this thinking it was an XL but it fits smaller because its a slim fit. Not the sellers fault just mine for not thinking this through
B00283HJLA|5|ya mun nice
B00C9I3P2G|5|Great belt, Thank You
B007IDNOGE|4|The sweatshirt is comfortable, and as thin as I wanted for warmer weather. The only issue is that the waist part is a but tighter than expected, while the shoulders are a bit larger but it is comfortable and perfect for what I bought it for.
B00D82W2US|4|LOVE  this coat! The sleves were tad but nothing that cannot be easily fixed. It looks and feels amazing. Giving it 4 stars because I have to have it hemmed but other than that, this coat is just marvelous.
B003X72SKM|2|This mask was purchased for a musical.  First, the nose comes down so far, it blocks the mouth, so it was not practical for singing.  Most of all, it was so uncomfortable!  It dug in around the eyes and the nose.  I spent a couple of hours trying to rig it, soften the edges, cut parts off, all to no avail.  Ultimately, we wound up not even using it.  It was a waste for our purposes, though the look of it was ugly and gnarly looking.  Oh, well.  Live and learn.
B00RSK73J6|5|cannot expect any better
B00AOJGXJE|5|Light weight, Looks great. Fits perfect with no tailoring necessary for a 6'3'' 210 lb guy.
B00C391KH8|1|This underwear is very tight fitting.  I went by the size recommendations but that didn't help.  I guess I'll have to deal with that or throw them away.  If you do buy this product buy 1 size larger, just in case.
B003IG26IM|5|They fit my wife Exactly how I wanted them to fit her.  They are Very High, she could pull them all the way up to just under the Buns.  Awesome, thanks!
B00BTM777M|1|Low quality, flimsy, bull coming off, pin on back saudered on backwards so it won't go into the belt hole. Makes a nice wall decoration since it's the size of a plate.
B005NFVDOE|5|Girlfriend wanted big fluffy earmuffs for the winter - she approved of these. They are more round shaped rather than the flat disks you often see sold in stores. Looks exactly as pictured.
B000SKCSWA|5|It was a perfect fit and the correct colors ordered.  Also, it came earlier than anticipated!  Wonderful!
B001FOR1R0|1|I have wore this belt for 2 weeks and buckle has come off strap. Made cheap is not a good product, waste of money and now need to buy a new one.
B002BUYSAA|5|Very flattering and yet still very professional.  Best I've found.  Good, sturdy material, with deep pockets.  Washes and irons well.  Would definitely order this again in the future.
B00FMJOORY|5|Perfect for dance and pool workouts.
B00EB1OWRQ|4|I'm used to Lane Bryant jeans, and always take a 22P bootcut, which land about 1/2 an inch above the ground in my Danskos. So I ordered the same in WallFlower and these things drag like a train, gonna need to hem them. They are also roomy throughout. I expected them t be really tight on first wear, so the stretch to form fit you as you wear them. These are already loose like that, and I'm afraid wearing them will result in additional stretching that will make them too loose. If so, I'll consign them and try a smaller size. On the plus side I loved everything else about them. The rise was perfect, the denim was strong but soft, the dye was fashionable without being inappropriate for work. I felt sexy in them, and thats how ya should feel in jeans :)
B004EIIL32|5|I purchased this cap for my grandson. He loves it! He and his twin brother wanted these caps to match their leather jackets. This one is black, the other was in brown. They both love these Leather Driving Caps from ULTRAFINO.hey are very well made. The leather is soft and supple.They look like they will last them for many years.
B00HVX8US8|5|this bag is very cool in white, its bigger than i expected so I will use it more for getaways than everyday use...this bag is priced much higher on other sites.  It's very different shape, sporty and classy i think too
B00H5O4ZZK|5|My son wanted this hat for some time, and I finally bought it for him.  He has a large head, so I was happy to read in previous reviews that it is made on the larger side.  Probably too large for most kids, but let's face it....it's a toy!
B00AK430WQ|4|great hat very nice fit the color was perfect, the H for hurley very nice  style just a very nice hat in general
B009OYLN4A|5|It does fit as expected, but I ordered one size larger to ensure that my DDD bust was covered. It is very flattering and I love the print!  The gathering at the small of the back is a nice touch - it keeps the suit from gaping and adds a nice touch for the low back without revealing any crack!
B007O3RDK6|5|for the price is was fantastic and it fit fine ( I have a larger head for a female) I got compliments on it all night for Halloween.
B003LO1XXU|4|I like the selection of colors for this particular brand of Carhart dress slacks.  These pants wear like iron where as most dress slacks last for a year before wearing out these last two to three years before any type of wear.
B000ZHBKTS|3|No elastic to hold them up. Even with a garter belt they tried to roll down.
B0006N23YW|5|nice hats block the sun well nice hats block the sun well nice hats block the sun well nice hats block the sun well good price
B011QYBMLY|3|I use this for working out, unfortunately the metal rods has come out stitching is not sturdy. Like how it makes me sweat when I work out.
B00H02ZDT4|1|The clip did not work well. The &#34; ball joint&#34; couldn't be tightened so the angle of the iphone couldn't be controlled and the clip would slip off the visor. I returned the product to Amazon. I can unfortunately not recommend this product with confidence.
B0027E2474|5|Very nice case
B005UD73NY|4|Feels so comfortable on.  I have large breasts and this bra feels great and holds just as good as an underwire bra.
B00MG7GI1A|5|I really like these leggings! They're very comfy. they're the right length too. I'm 5'6&#34; & 103lbs. & they fit like they were made just for me! I wash them by hand & hang them across a drier rack over-night to dry & then use an iron for a little touch up. They're a good weight too...you can't see thru the material.
B008MPV9A0|4|I have this and the BS474.  In retrospect I wish I had purchased the weather version of this belt.  I like the weathered look better but this belt is great.  It made of thick quality leather and I think in a few more months after it is well and truly broken in it will look great.  I'm not sure how they measure the size but the 34 fits me perfectly but the 36 is long enough I am going to have the leather trimmed to shorten it.  But it is leather so that will work.<br /><br />For size reference I have a 33&#34; waist and I like to wear my belts loose.
B0084EFW84|5|Cute girls backpack (BP). My daughter loves it! All of her things for daycare fit well. I'd highly recommend this product to anyone.
B0053XF85G|5|I really like this garment.  It held me in nicely without being terribly uncomfortable.  It definitely was more effective and a nicer quality than Spanx!
B00DNVGJIA|5|Purchased the mask for my wife since we are going to a Masquerade Ball themed party.  She absolutely love it.  Looks so much better in person.  I most certainly recommend.
B00TK5WDM4|1|No no no. Way too small. I got a xxl couldn't even fit over my shoulders.  I read pervious reviews on  ordering it bigger. I normally wear a large.
B00M1QVETM|4|It was as small as expected, it's just I ordered a size too small.  Other than that it was a good shirt
B00SKI5MHK|1|Not worth the money
B00MJA4K9G|3|nice lingerie but runs very small.
B004TXYBIG|4|My in a month 5 year old boy is average to above average height and it was a little small, but he loves it for swim team!
B00CPSSOSA|5|nice
B00GRDC372|5|Great wallet, nicely made and very slim
B00MJEC7CO|5|Absolutely adorable, as pictured, and well made. I ordered a size 3-4 because my daughter is 4 (newly), but is definitely on the slim side. Most clothes fit her large. I am happy I picked this size, but I can foresee very shortly in the future her having to wear this with tights ad it being more of a tunic than a dress, but that's fine with me :) Absolutely love the gorgeous pattern, and the fact the dress has pockets. Overall, an adorable, true to size garment!
B003ZYDUGY|4|The sizing is way off
B00XYK553A|5|I bought 3 versions of jeggings for my daughter who strongly dislikes jeans.  This was her favorite pair.  They were soft and fit comfortably as expected for her size.
B00VGRC4EQ|5|Lightweight and cool. The colors pop and they make my girlfriend's legs look great!
B006G5NUPA|3|I ordered a 3t in this cute little outfit however the hoodie fit like a 2t and the pants like a 4t. The Hello Kitty zipper on the hoodie broke of on the first wash. Very disappointed as it is a cute outfit for a great price.
B00JM9SYIK|5|This is a FANTASTIC coat, especially for the price.  We got this for my husband so that he had a more versatile winter coat.  We liked the description, but assumed it would probably be a little on the flimsy side since the company wasn't asking $150 for it.  WRONG!!!<br /><br />I'm not going to say it is &#34;extremely high quality&#34; or that it's made of anything really amazing or expensive, but I think this thing will go a long ways.  The 3-in-1 is an awesome system, and all the fabrics and materials are nice to the touch and they do what they're supposed to do --- keep you warm, repel water, detach, reattach, etc etc etc.  The zippers all appear to be of pretty great quality.<br /><br />This fits my husband a little bit big, but that was &#34;as expected&#34; because he has a very very thin build and small frame except for his broad shoulders, so mostly everything is a little roomy on him.<br /><br />I would buy this again in a heartbeat if I had the need or knew someone who needed a new coat.  Easily worth the money.
B00ACIFZ3W|3|I guess different manufacturers make sizes differently.  Perhaps washing will adjust the size.
B0074OC4AY|5|cannot find these in stores - my daughter wants to keep her 3-year old in the onesies. These were great.
B0073MLZ70|5|Great product !!!  Very well constructed,  leather very soft !!!!
B00DSSLZQY|5|Amazing . Love this skirt .
B00147FC4M|2|These gloves only work for me for about the highest twelve degrees of \\"glove riding\\" temperatures.  I'd say between 33 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit.  If it's any colder out, I lose feeling in my middle finger.  And that's when I put them on while I'm still at home.  I won't blame them for overheating, because then it's fine to just remove them, but I recommend looking elsewhere if you commute via bike in a cold weather city or if you're prone to winter joyrides.  These are too expensive for the amount of help they've offered me.  I've felt better with a cheap ($11) pair of neoprene fishing gloves.  After riding with them, my hands might smell like feet, but at least I can still move them.  These 40 dollar Pearl Izumis?  Not so much.
B00F97U88S|3|I'm disappointed that these jeans were too short in the rise. The legs looked really good, but they were uncomfortable so I'm returning them.  The tag says &#34;sits below waist&#34; but these were too &#34;below&#34; for comfort and don't look like the photo.
B0018P6CDU|5|When I got these and put them on, I was so happy with the fit that I ordered two other pair of Levi's. The other Levi's were the Men's 511 Skinny Zipper Back Jean, Rigid Villian, and the Levi's 514 Slim Straight Welder Jean, Sail. Unfortunately, neither pair fit nearly as well as the Levi's Men's 514 Slim Straight Leg Vert Jean, and I returned them. On the 514, the little extra upper back pocket is perfect for me (I use a thin, small wallet that fits great in there) and the cut and taper and break for my size is perfect. I also think the color and sheen of the Rub Out version is stylish and contemporary and versatile -- they are sort of shiny and smooth-looking, but not cheesy. The only con is that they are a bit thin. All-in-all, they are very cool jeans, and I may buy one more pair or try the 514 in a different wash.
B001H0F6BA|4|This would have received 5 stars, but the material is cotton not typical Jersey material as one may expect. Not sure if i overlooked this in the description or not though. Fits well and good work out/lounging around pant.
B0059DWKMO|3|I feel like Columbia makes their current line too large.  I'm definitely not a small person and this jacket was quite oversized on me.  Otherwise, it probably would have been a nice jacket, but I returned it without using it.
B00HUF6174|4|Love the colors, but runs large for my 13 month old who is 21lbs and 30.5&#34; tall.
B00LAUJF3M|4|Fit perfect was very satisfied
B00JDTRZJI|5|Happy colors,feels good good fit.y
B003E80NK2|3|Color is described as beige, but unbleached canvas would be more accurate.  I wear 7 1/8 hat and, following sizing guidelines, chose small medium, but its too small.  There is what looks like a size adjustment strap tacked onto the back but it is pure ornament, it cannot be used to change the fit.  I like the short brim design and would still like to have one of these, but I'm not going to the trouble to send it back.  Maybe if I can give this one away I'll order another.
B00FWMY7SM|4|The shirt fabric is thin; and probably thin by design ... thought up by cool people who know fashion better than me. However, depending on what you want showing underneath should determine whether or not to purchase this item. For example, I have massive muscles that should be on display, so the shirt is a plus. However, if you have eaten too many Skittles or the hair on your chest can compete with that of a woolly mammoth ... maybe you should just move along.
B00EO99BQW|5|Love the shirt. I have already received about 10 compliments from coworkers. Gem! Great for work and play. Super high quality.
B00BMLQOCE|5|Received  this  item in a timely  manner  and  was exactly  what  I  expected
B002ZG8INI|5|Really lovely fit
B00CBEL9FS|5|Love it and fits great
B009WUIGVY|5|My daughter loved this robe. It was well made, fit well, and seemed luxurious! The monkey design is cute as well.
B00F98THL6|4|If you are a size 6.5, you should get a small, but I didn't notice if they offered that size.
B004IYIY16|5|First the shorts were $5 to $10 less than I was seeing in stores.  I must have ten pairs.  I wear them for golf so they take a beating.<br /><br />I also prefer double pleated.  Most of what I was seeing in stores were flat front shorts which are nice when one is 25, but less so when you are 66.  It appears that Nautica has done away with pleated for the future.  If so, I will need to find another brand.
B00CA6VKF6|5|These are the pants I ordered.<br /><br />The exact ones.<br /><br />No surprises here.<br /><br />Grayish jeans. Nice and soft. Levis.<br /><br />The ones I wanted.<br /><br />Cool pants.
B00L4IJ7HO|4|I bought this for my wife and it fit her well and performed great on several hikes in the rain.
B008DZZIRY|5|It is perfect! I am using it for the cape which is part of my solo dress. I think the cross will add more class and style.
B007QSNJ8E|5|These are super soft and comfortable!  I kinda feel like I'm wearing sweatpants, but they have a flattering fit.  The cords are small and they don't make that annoying 'whishing' sound when you walk and it's not obvious from a distance of more than a foot that you are even wearing cords.  I can wear these easily into the office for work.  As most of the NYD jeans, they do run long though...I actually bought the same pair in petite to wear with flats...I'm 5'6\\" and the petite actually is perfect for true flats.
B000OQQNTW|5|They fit as expected and she love it. She was so happy and told me that fit perfectly.
B004M6UDC8|5|Good wallet
B00A6TFSWK|2|Fit small
B008BOX70W|2|M is pretty large on the shoulders area and in length. My bet is that S would be too small for me
B00OWN16E0|2|went up a size as the reviewers said.... its better to get a size down then large :/
B00D40JIJC|5|This suite is flattering! The long bow/neck strap provides a little coverage for those that are more modest. The underwire keeps the girls in place nicely. Love this suite.
B00JB8VZ0G|5|great
B00D7ZJFLK|5|GREAT PRICE!!. I love the fit feel and size.
B00F929NB6|5|I am quite pleased with my Cuddl Duds top.  However, I'm glad I didn't go by the size chart.  According to the size chart I would have ordered a small, but I went a bit larger based on other reviews and am happy I did.  The fabric is relatively form fitting in a cozy way, not restricting at all.  I love wearing my thumbs in the sleeve when I'm chilly but it's easy enough to wear them normally when the task requires my hands.  I would definitely recommend this top, it goes especially nice with yoga pants.  If you're usually a size medium but the sizing chart tells you you're a small, I'd go with your usual size medium.  Otherwise, it's great!
B00BY9ISSC|5|I LOVE the fit. Its sexy yet comfortable & my husband loves it. ;)
B007N1CCDM|3|Wish they had this in size small for petite guys, medium is just too big
B0006FUCHK|5|So every single rubies helmet of every type is not screen accurate and is usually hideously warped. However many of them can be saved just by doing a quick google search. I recently bought this helmet and turned it into a majestic master piece that is almost screen accurate.  If you look at this site here it will show you how to make this helmet look good. [...]
B0013FHN3S|5|Everything was good.
B004WSD8MI|3|A little baggy
B00AVBFH9M|4|I bought this for a Halloween costume, and it was perfect for that purpose.  Better quality then you get with costume stuff purchased from iParty, good enough quality to wear as a regular hat (although barely).  The back is a trucker's hat, the front is made of a foam similar to those novelty hands you get at football games.  Fit a large person's head perfectly and comfortably.  Looks just like the hats in the cartoons.<br /><br />The one thing that made me nervous was the shipping estimate I got online was really, really slow.  I asked the company about that and they were quite nice.  I ended up getting it in 13 days.
B0082C1CAA|5|This was a purchase for my daughter who is crazy about tupac. The shirt fits perfectly and looks awesome. I'm so glad I was able to find it junior girl's clothing. Otherwise I would've been forced to buy a men's t shirt and it wouldn't have been the same. It's beautiful and price is appropriate for quality.
B004DMON7M|2|They looked so neat, but the earpiece broke the 2nd time I tried them on - I had to use tape to wear them.
B001A1U0TY|5|it is a great buy for your  mask collection when it came in it was well kept looking forward to buying all the other ones from the movie
B007TKSX4E|5|Great shirt and material. Fit great and has not shrunk.
B00MZZ6J62|3|The fabric is lovely. A great feel. However, the sizing is way off. I am usually a small to medium. I ordered the large because I wanted it loose as it was my plan to wear it as a nightshirt. The large is tight fitting and nowhere close to being what I would consider large. I would suggest buying at least two sizes larger than your normal fit.
B000IBKPNI|4|Bought this for my wife and it fits perfectly, just what I'd hoped for
B00EUMI5F6|4|I kept this one even tho I spent way too much for what it is. Its a very simple dress. The color is a nice heathered red. I got a small and its great altho it does show cleavage. I am 5'8, 120 lbs and a 34D. I also got the brown one in an XS because it was on sale but they were sold out of the Smalls. Its a tad small on me but doesnt show the cleavage as much.
B00MFTS8ZS|5|Perfect socks to compliment my teenage daughters Halloween costume!
B00PFCDPU0|5|Love it
B00CZ7VO42|2|The product looked nice in the picture, but upon trying it on, I have found that even though its wire free, I still felt like something was digging into me. It also does not provide enough lift and support for large busts, but I also suppose thats personal preferences, some people may not care about support and lift, but I prefer a bit of padding and lift, especially if it is wire free, not to the extent of being a push up bra though. Hope this review helps! But with sizing it was correct, you can order your usual size and it will be fine.
B0045G1XH4|5|Nicely made. True to size.
B0044XBYX6|5|Soft and comfortable. Barely wrinkles
B00LZRVTRK|5|Fit was contour
B00BLJFATA|2|Do yourself a favor... Order a size larger. Pants have draw strings to tighten waste. I don't mind a fitted pant but if you have an athletic build they will basiclly be tight and uncomfortable.
B00DYPU41S|4|Very pretty on my 6 years old daughter  we love it
B00EN9IOL6|4|As expected
B00CHQ4MTA|5|i love this robe,,,its as soft as i was hoping, i love the colors and i love the length,,it was definitely worth it,,,oh and its a light weight robe but yet keeps you warm,,,i know it will be one of my favorite robes:)
B0064Y4EZ8|5|I love these shorts, great fit, comfortable great to walk in! Still fit the same after several washes. I have already ordered another pair.
B000T6KFVY|5|Hubby is thrilled with it.  It is not an orange shirt but the design is....  it is a nice contrast.  I would buy it again.
B00BXQTUPG|5|size was very good i must say and i also ordered another style from your store,just waiting to get it
B00D3RXBTE|5|Fits true to size - very pretty - found the matching bottom and love it too!!  Would recommend this for sure.
B006B2RX88|5|This shirt is amazing and i will definitely be ordering other items from this site. The material is like silk and is so soft. The sizing info is right on and i got the right size that i needed to fit me. luv it luv it
B004XH50EC|5|I really enjoy these blouses, soft mostly wrinkle free, great for traveling, or just wearing to church or every day. Very comfortable.
B00WFP2EE8|3|If you are hippy, order two sizes up. The pattern is lovely and the construction is nice
B00KCSEHZE|5|If you are not Thin/in shape stay Away! If you are, These are for YOU!  Look super sharp!  Nice dressy Jean.  Highly recommended!
B003TFE5HW|5|I was VERY pleased with this order. I bought this to go with  a shirt I bought from amazon that show enough back to worry about your bra showing. This shrapless bra worked wonders. I have never owned one before, and was a little worried at first, but I would now recomend this to anyone.<br /><br />The stickyness is slighty odd at fist, but adjusted to with ease.<br />Removal is not painful<br />They stayed in place perfectly, and never feared they were pealing off.<br />They see to fit better than some of my regular bras.<br />material is soft, light, and comfortable.<br />I recomend standing in frount of a mirror in order to set evenly<br />I had no problems with the cleaning and drying process. I just let them sit over night.<br />My order arrived shortly after my shirt even though I bought the shirt almost a week before.
B00BBGCHS0|5|Perfect.
B00BF73FO0|4|I really like this for around the house and sleeping.  I need to hem because it comes unharmed but that is fine since I have to hem almost everything since I am 5'1&#34;
B001U33TT0|5|Just as good as American Apparel.
B00SZRLKXQ|5|I was really weary about ordering any clothing online but this really well surprisingly and it looks really cute and it's really flattering. The only thing is that when you're ordering it, order one size up because they run small. That's what I did and it fits perfectly. It's decently well made too. And for what I paid that's really good. I would definitely recommend it :) I'm 5'2 and 142 so I got an XL which is a size up from what I would normally get. So my shape is a little curvier so It's really flattering as well.
B00PIMLJUA|1|Should be listed as children's size! Not for adults.
B005CW5AX8|5|Love
B007EDKOVG|4|These are a bit pricey in comparison to other shrugs, but the quality is very good.  For the nice thickness of the fabric, it feels quite light wearing one of these, which is nice.<br /><br />The only problem I ran into was the slightly odd sizing.  The do run a size or two small, but the fabric seems to be stretchable enough to conform more to the arms overtime.  However, I got an X-Large, and the back is a little too loose, even though the arms fit well.  I guess they assumed bigger arms=bigger back or smaller arms=small back.
B00DJPQHAK|5|Very light weight, but cozy and warm.....  Very stylish too!  I would buy another one in different color!  Great looking coat!
B00VZFW4OE|1|2x would have trouble fitting a small child
B00J4BZN4Y|5|Super cute! I ordered a size 18months based on reviews and glad i did. He's only wearing it once and don't need him to grown into it. He's 32in tall 25lbs and wears cloth diapers. And it fit just right!  The hat is a little flimsy, but fits perfect. His head measures 19in.
B00B002XEA|4|The matching pants came in another color----Not expected nor appreciated.  Otherwise the fabric is nice and it fits properly/
B0027APHFY|5|My husband really, really likes his John Lennon tee-shirt a great deal. It fits him perfectly! Would buy another someday!
B003QJUHI2|5|I cannot say enough about Sakkas dresses. I know I have purchased about ten. I will be purchasing a few more for my cruise to jamacia in August.
B007HP1BH2|4|I love scarf... it's beautiful and goes great with jeans, etc.  The fabric is soft, kind of a light gauze, and the colors are so pretty.  One thing that I'm not thrilled with is the ends because it tends to fray.  I've thought of doing an edge stitch but that wouldn't look good so I guess I'll just deal with it.
B00KAJ0EFC|5|Very high quality shirt with dual stiched seams from the shoulder to sleeves.  Great design too !
B008HTPHGS|5|This was a gift and the recipient was very happy with it.
B00KOL2E3G|2|Too....large, can't wear
B005CWUTT8|4|I had wanted for the yellow to have been more gold.  However, it is of a fine quality and it is OK.
B002V0FNZO|4|Great shirt.
B000VR9MBK|3|it would have been nice to know how much it would shrink when washed and dried.  I feel it shrank a lot
B00ES83OK8|5|I get so many compliments!  I ordered the plum/purple. It's beautiful. It fits snug, I might have ordered up a size to an XL if I had known it would be this snug, but it's not awful. I'm 5'11&#34; and wear a 38C bra. I think it's because I have rather wide shoulders that it fits a bit snug.  However, I get a ton of compliments so I'm happy with it.  The fabric is really nice.
B00OK5BBJA|4|They are nice looking, however too thin and not soft enough.
B00B64UOSM|1|I was misled to believe that this was an official Duck Dynasty product.  It is not.  And I bought 2 of these t-shirts.
B0050AFXDY|5|Excellent work shirts and very economical.  Fit well and like the variety of colors.
B004P3A2II|5|Dickies have always been so well made!  These pants are perfect for work, they take a beating and still look good.
B0011MXQAW|4|I usually don't where GLO jeans, but I'm happy I made an exception with these. The jeans are cute, but I wish it had embellished back pockets.
B00T23PH86|1|Way too tiny. Also, the crotch area is so short that they ride up like crazy. A waste of money, I still have 2 pairs I haven't worn that I would love to send back for the moneys worth
B00389VMN4|5|Really like these briefs.  Like the 'tagless' and extremely soft waistband.  The waistband doesn't cut into you but lays softly around you.
B00FN9THXO|4|Very nice hat. Soft material.<br />Only drawback is the perspective of the lettering in the arc. Should have been clear and distinctive.<br />It's still a very nice hat (or cap if one prefers).
B004O9U4C2|1|Very flimsy hat, not worth the money
B00DESVZ5E|5|This is your typical heavy duty &#34;Hanes&#34; type t shirt. These are men sizes, I got the small and I would say the small is true to a man's size small. Print is a very pretty color.
B00DYS9CH2|4|Love the coat but must send back. XXL usual coat size this just too big.
B00PVN3VYI|4|Ordered black one too!
B00HQDJ1UY|5|very cute, definitely glad I went with it. my daughter loves it so i'm guessing its comfortable
B00IYUKOF4|5|Super cute and you can wear it so many ways. I'm having shoulder surgery and won't be able to put my left arm through a shirt, so this shawl is perfect to help cover my left side in fashion!
B00RKJQ8CI|3|nice sweatshirt but doesn't have any print on the back like in the picture. that's annoying, especially after I emailed the seller and received no response. thanks
B00M4JDC4Q|5|I am in between a 6 & 8 mainly because I have a small top frame and wide hips. When I received the 10 I was nervous that it would not fit. You are able to tighten the top because of the drawstring bustier. I am only 5'4 & I wore a 3in heel and the dress dragged a little so be prepared for alterations if you are my height. The dress was a hit & I recommend the purchase.
B000FKMEI6|5|These socks were originally purchased as a Christmas gift and they were such a big hit (both in size and comfort) that another 3 pack HAD to be ordered because only these socks are being worn.
B00FJ5LI3O|2|I work as an electrician and wanted a wallet that would keep dust and debris from damaging the magnetic strip on my credit/debit cards. This wallet provided that function. However, within a 3 month period of use, the outside of the case has become severely dented and scratched and the outer metal case has separated from the plastic inner parts. Seems like poor quality, at least it was low cost.
B0050VM66K|5|I bought this shirt for my boyfriend as Goonies is one of his favorite movies.<br />He loved it!  The quality of the shirt was great and the size was perfect.  He wears the shirt all the time! What a Goonie!
B00GTJIHME|5|This is my second pair of these unique designed pants.  The legs were a little bit tight, but I do have big calfs.  So, if you have skinny legs, it will fit just fine.  I am a size 14 and the overall fit was fine.  Love the design and the uniqueness of it will have folks stopping and asking, &#34;where did you get that outfit?&#34;
B00RW9MUSM|5|Very light weight, loose fitting.  Pretty color and unique bird patterns. Love it!
B005KD5W50|1|These would be decent boxers if they didn't have the most uncomfortable tag in the world. It feels like it is cutting through my skin. And it is nearly impossible to remove without ruining stitches. For $10 each, i expected them to be comfortable.
B00FXJ0CZ6|3|I am a size 8 and ordered it in large. It was so tight that it wrinkled around my body and almost cut through my waist line. I will have to order an XL. However, it is the company's responsibility to fix this  issue, since it is made in USA .
B00FYZ22RA|5|it is a great product thanks once again from steve
B00MHDF6HU|3|i got this in XL and it has good length and fit, but it was very sheer.
B00BLXMO2W|5|The fit is perfect! It is comfortable and keeps the girls in place during my high impact workout..
B0057PS62M|5|My 9-year-old grandson was very pleased with the terry hooded turkish robe we gave him for Christmas.  He said,\\"This is awesome!\\"
B005OSQXZY|5|My boss liked this tie.
B00BM7DLFQ|5|I bought this for my sister and she loves them and I can't believe how great she looks. She has tried others and they just didn't look good under her pants. but these look make her look amazing.
B00K5SBIEE|5|I love Hanes and I could not believe the price.  Unbeatable, in addition to the correct size.  I still have to put slashes in the elastic, b/c of a back injury.  So the elastic does wear out & frazzle much quicker.  It is difficult to find size 5 in any store. And forget size 5 shoes, I hate looking for them.
B005Q9ONVW|5|there was nothing I disliked about this product
B00SXBA0K8|5|Exactly as described.  Very beautiful!  A little tricky to squeeze open, but worth it.  I get so many compliments.
B0007OF2QQ|5|Bought this hat for my son who loves to kayak. He loves it! It is very light weight and is almost impossible to lose in a high wind. Great fabric too.
B00IB6OKQK|5|I love the nightgown, the fabric is so soft & made well.
B00C814WCQ|5|Colorful, durable and perfect.
B00E4QNQ98|3|Nice patch but this did not appear to be an iron-on. The adhesive did not stick so had to sew it on.  More time consuming to sew on than I had anticipated.  Also did not come with any instructions like the other patches I have order from amazon.
B00553XXSI|5|it was one of the best thing that i order and will be order more as soon as i can love it thank you all again.
B00A1AJDFW|5|I've worn this dress to a wedding and charity event and received many compliments. Several friends noted the eye-catching neon green underneath the navy lace detail.<br /><br />On both occasions, I paired the dress with nude shoes because there's already so much color. I agree with one of the other reviewers that it can seem a bit square/boxy, but overall, I like the fit because it flatters my curvier body type without sticking to it so that it looks inappropriate. The best thing about this dress is that it's comfortable and practical. I can eat and breathe in it unlike some others hanging in my closet.
B001OE2B7Q|5|I bought this belt for a dance i was going to and i like it a lot and everyone else i know likes it. That was about a month ago and the belt is still in great shape. Honstly i was not planing on getting a belt that was as good qualty as it is.I even got i nickname from wearing this belt (\\"white belt kid\\" thats what some people call me). I am very happy with this belt. It shiped very fast and just came in the mail.
B00W5VT8SM|5|100% FAVORABLE- SUPER GREAT SHIRT/ AND FAST SHIPPING
B00J5C111G|5|Very soft and nice to wear.
B00CSUITDU|3|Pretty cute top but not that supportive, this is a young ladies top!
B00BT0KJ88|4|i'll let you know about quality.
B00AYXFIZ0|3|They look exacly like the photo. They don't make your bum look amazing like most leggings... almost FLAT. They run, like tights also. Could only wear once due to the run.
B00LL462CE|1|I opened it up and it was all tangled.  I tried to untangle and the item broke immediately.  The chain is very thin and terrible quality!
B00CBSVY5E|5|Fits as expected (daughter is average size, 8 months old) and should continue to fit through the rest of the winter no problem unless she has a big growth spurt.
B00GKEI480|5|I bought this for my husband who is a huge Harry Potter fan & he loved it. He has sensitive skin, but this fabric didn't bother him at all, thankfully.
B002AHZXBM|4|Little baggy but fits great!!
B003IFY78A|5|I'm extremely tall, but have been wanting thigh high socks for a long time now. Everywhere had socks that were too low and ultimately just slid below my knee. These socks are not kidding around with the length. I have a 36&#34; inseam, and I'd say they hit the 33&#34; mark if I force them all they way up. They naturally rest at the 31&#34; or 30&#34;. I'd say an extremely reasonable length for thigh high socks, finally.
B00DPNZ1MQ|5|This is a nice, soft , classic sweater . Love it. I ventured into a men's sweater because I thought it would work and it does. I usually wear a misses size large and could probably have bought a medium. I rolled the cuff up on the sleeves and I know the shoulders are too big. But it looks ok still.
B00EKPO9J4|5|I love this costume!  For the price it is a very good value.  It fits perfectly, shows a little more cleavage than I expected but hey....maybe that's a good thing!  And I didn't realize how many accessories came with it.  I am very pleased.
B00607PF2U|5|I bought this little newborn outfit for a friend's baby shower.  It is absolutely adorable.  I give it five stars because it is soft and cuddly, well made, and very sweet.  We don't know yet if it's a girl or a boy, and this could easily be worn by either.  Very precious.
B00NEQTDSC|5|Jacket was attached to dress. I did not  like that.
B00DQYWKA0|5|It's very lightweight and folds up to about a 9&#34;x6&#34;x2&#34; for the XL size. The pockets are conveniently large and the cinches work well.
B00O8HMGLM|3|a little disappointed with this jacket #1 the sleeves are too lone for a large #2 the zippers are in backwards
B00KLWWEJW|5|So pretty, want more in different colors. Worth every penney.
B0055TV8P2|5|Awesome mask at a great price! I'll order more animals the future.
B00KVVZI9G|5|Great! !
B00GEFSUG6|5|Criteria:  Weight of fabric, front and &#34;rear&#34; coverage, comfortable waist and leg openings, no drag while swimming or exercising, dries quickly.  After trying 5 different ones, this is my absolute 1st choice.
B00QTKU294|5|Comfortable especially in HOT weather. 100% polyester wicks the sweat away and drys fast after washing.<br />I just returned from Thailand - it was HOT even for the Thai and these were great.<br /><br />Also, Amazon had the best price!
B007IGI7EA|5|my daughter wore this costume to the movie party and was a hit just like her sister the sang song and acted like the real deal
B00P5ANYJO|5|It was what I expected
B002DGECX0|5|beautiful lace gloves got these for my daughter to where to her vintage themed 6th birthday party she loves them they look exactly as they do online I go the white and got them in the size 4 to 7 years that's the size for a six year old the product arrived on time and shipping was good and so was the seller would buy from again very pleased.
B004SPOF90|5|got this for my daughter to wear in a school production.  it was fantastic and really made the outfit pop!  she got a ton of compliments.
B002XG7KS4|3|All I was looking for was a check book but this has an extra pocket and zipper and pretty thick.  It would be a nice item for a lady to carry in her purse but not something I want to carry around with me.  It will suffice for now
B000LK3HRW|5|The straps on this bra are so amazingly comfortable!  It is not lined, which is okay except in the cold :) but still gives ample 'suspension'.  It's not a push-up, so girls with naturally large breasts need to keep that in mind, but it does give a great silhouette under a t-shirt (which is no silhouette, in reality - there are no tell-tale bra lines around the edges of the bra.  I think the lady with the secret called that invisible edge [?]).  After hauling around 34D (which has since grown into a 34F) for 30 years, I was seriously considering a reduction only because of the pain in my shoulders (you girls know what I mean, where you wake in the morning with your last 2 fingers on each hand numb or tingly because your bra cut into your shoulder while you slept).  I didn't really want a reduction, but I was just tired of the pain that my shoulders were starting to endure (and knew I couldn't handle many more years of this pain...I'm not a masochist).  This bra has changed all of that for me and is my dedicated sleeping bra (yes I sleep in my bra...if you have big breasts and don't want them anywhere but high up, you sleep in a bra!).  Fit was exactly what I wanted, size was spot on for me, and the price was fairly inexpensive to what I've spent on those high end bras that I was wearing when the pain started.
B002NPCJ5E|5|Fit great and received as promised
B00ZRADAI2|1|Fit like a shirt not a dress
B0062ZGAM4|5|Buen Producto 100% Recomendado
B007JE3BU6|5|I'm so happy with this bra, I could cry. It's Oeko-Tex Certified so I know it's ok to have against my skin constantly. It is also sheer, but well-made with a supportive strap - which means I don't have to sacrifice sexiness for functionality. And finally, it's comfortable. After having a baby I'm a 40 C, and I've had bras that pinch, dig, and scratch. This one doesn't. I'm so happy to find a bra that's raised my standard of comfort without sacrificing beauty! Hence the happy tears. I'd definitely recommend this bra to any larger - chested lady.
B00ABY8MKK|4|nice
B00FZR0U80|1|I've worn Hanes cotton panties for decades.  Every now and then I realize my current stock is looking tired, so I toss them out and buy more.  I've never had any issues with Hanes, until now.<br /><br />I bought three packs of panties and threw out most of the old stock.  After washing, I put the new ones in the drawer last night.  Today, after my shower, I grabbed a pair.  I noticed they didn't feel quite right - more like cheesecloth than high quality cotton.  When I put them on, they were FAR TOO SMALL!  Yes, they were marked as being the same size.  But they were clearly trying to take me out via painful, sadistic compression.<br /><br />Hanes, I am so disappointed.  Other brands are getting smaller and cheaper and more expensive all the time, but you had never failed me until now.  Obviously, my trust in you was misplaced.  We are through, and I've told everyone how cruel you were to me, your most faithful friend.
B0085K3676|3|This is the first bra that I have purchased that fits properly.  The lace is a little bit itchy.
B00IAK7GX6|5|Very comfortable fit.
B000A2KDTQ|5|Excellent product
B0056IUPQU|3|I would buy this again.  But if you are looking for an heirloom piece, this probably isn't the outfit for you.  Its not that well made (probably won't keep for years), but it is adorable and I was very happy with it.  My son is 11 months, he is 50th percentile (maybe smaller) and I ordered the 12-18 month size.  It fit him perfectly.
B00JAX0W60|5|My 4 year old loves her winter jacket!  Fleece lined with removable hood. We ordered two sizes up.  Its a little big but we just roll up the sleeves one fold. Super cute!
B00KTHR18S|5|The dress is beautiful. It fits my grand niece perfectly. I love the color.
B00O4EGKVG|2|This was supposed to be a 2XL, and it was more like a Large.
B00LB9YQ0E|5|Good quality hat, speedy delivery, a good buy overall.
B001A68CL2|5|Perfect for my husband, he uses while doing yard work for the protection of his head, face and especially neck
B000Q6N564|1|These would've been great if they'd fit properly . As they've a raised nipple form , one must be aware that the ring size could be detrimental to the actual reason for having in first place. There are better items on the market.  I suggest moving along to the other items  until this company properly understands what an American woman's large , medium and even smaller sized breast size can be. Super teeny tiny isn't gonna cut it ! I returned the item immediately , disappointed.
B004YZ86XA|3|The material is a bit stiff.The neck line infront is a bit too high. It shows with everything. Nice Colours
B00BNGZTT2|5|I brought this for my grand son and he wears it all the time and pretends to be slender man
B00J3QHOJM|1|They don't stay up I recommend either sewing them on to the costume.
B005EOL5X8|1|very large i lost my money
B00IUCUGQS|3|thesw leggings are nice and breathable, having a stretchy kind of fabric. They look nice on and the pattern is cute. The only issues are is that they hug your legs a little tight and within my first few times putting it on it ripped a hole in the crotch when I pulled it up, so all in all its cute but not durable, which is fine for its price
B00A4TMAQY|5|I wasn't sure how this shirt was going to fit as the other reviewers said this shirt runs small.  I usually wear a medium in shirts but I ordered the XL.  I'm glad I did!  It fits great and I love it!  The material of this shirt is thin so I don't know how it will wash or wear but I want to purchase it in the pink also!
B00MS4YDW2|1|Was not what I expected..fits like a shirt. The cut style from the pics look the same. But it just not fitting rite. Too large but too short at the same time.
B00LG6GPXS|5|Good shirt
B0006LTER8|3|The cut and color are great but it doesn't fit me - my other 34s fit fine.  Maybe it's just diet time...
B00D316P34|2|size is too large.
B00DULVEXS|2|Fits way smaller than I thought it would.
B00NTYH80Y|5|very beautiful and soft
B001HK23KM|5|The dress is beautiful,it fits perfectly,The color is better than the one on the picture(plum)....I love it.It's very slimming and comfortable too.Shipping was very fast.Thank you!
B00ITKN8BG|4|Very comfortable and shapely.  Would be five stars if the front was a little fuller - when I move around a lot or bend I seem to have to retuck...
B004MPR7CS|5|The pants fits very well, no problems and we were well satisfied. But o the other hand they could be a little cheaper, I know you have to make money on your products but also its a hard society as well.
B00KOBIMDW|5|Love this Jacket
B00J9QB5O6|5|Wore this for the UK/UL game.  I got so many complements on the shirt.  Everyone wanted one. It is great quality as well.
B00EOWAGRM|5|This was an impulse buy when I saw the great discount.  I love the coat.  It fits just right and the details, like the buttons, are very nice.
B00AD7KZ64|3|Socks were too small, but only realized this after I tried them on.  Next time will order one size larger.
B000N8THJY|5|Great Product; great fit; great price, item came as expected; will recommend to a friend. My family member loved it!
B00SLTUUVG|5|I was sceptical about ordering these but once I tried them on I love the way they fit & their very comfortable, I would defiantly order this brand again.
B00M3H0L9S|3|Great material, although sizing could be reconfigured
B003CHX4RE|5|These tights are pricy but who wouldn't want something that is warm, warm, warm, and fits like a second skin.<br />Love wearing these tights!
B009ABWHPG|5|Great wallet, will last for a few years.  The 2nd one my husband has owned.
B00ALZ24Y4|5|great gift.
B003T9VKG2|5|No complaints at all
B00BRIAW84|4|Fit as expected, nicely made.  I don't usually order a long in suit jackets but I want more coverage in a rain coat and so the long works out well.
B00AEVJ22C|3|Just had no support on the top and was to loose and the bottom to tight, could just be my body. Don't see how this can be called push up, didn't even hold up anything! I sent it back with no problem.
B00TZ9LXEY|4|Fit as expected love this dress!!
B009GU3RIC|4|The bras are great.
B00AARJ2I4|5|Very good product
B00HRJVSBW|2|If you're into Brazil, you would rather buy a t-shirt that would read BRASIL.  Just like a real brazilian would.  The spelled name Brazil is only for us here in the U.S. Nevertheless this is a beautiful t-shirt.  If it read Brasil, I would be buying it.
B00R74WR8A|4|Material seams thinner than other starter sweaters I have but still looks good. Received on time.
B000LNECS2|5|This product was perfect for our halloween costume.The shipping was fast as we had ordered the wrong size the first time and worried we would not have a costume in time. It was not a problem, the product arrived in plenty of time.
B000GIL1W2|5|The tank fits as it should, I should have ordered a smaller size. Usually L t-shirts are fitted but not glued to body. I'm 5'8, 175lbs about 14%bf 42-43 inch chest. I don't have the lats to fill this so it's baggy on sides. Shirt fits as sized, but a medium would fit my frame better.
B00NMVMYDK|5|Very comfortable  it doesn't  feel as if u have on any underwear at all it wow!.
B005MH8SRI|3|Nice and comfortable but they are too long. I'm debating if I should return them and try the smaller size or have them altered.
B003V8AGW0|4|Gerber clothing ALWAYS runs very small.  As long as you remember this and buy 2 sizes larger...literally...you will be pleased.
B000L7J18Y|4|I ordered these to wear to the gym.  The price is a really great deal for 6 pairs of relatively comfortable socks.  The only issue I have is that the length of the heel is a little awkward.  I wear a size 6.5 -- so maybe its my own fault for having small feet... but the heel comes up a little uncomfortably over my shoe.  The thickness of the sock is just fine -- I just think that the sizing is a little off.  They're decent for their purpose and price, though!
B008VPS986|5|these are loose fitting and with a very comfortable fabric that make perfect sleep shorts.  I can even be seen outside of my bedroom in these.
B00C7KBO0Q|2|Too small
B00IZ38GL4|1|Way too small
B000FW3W26|5|very good quality
B001N4OCII|4|this is very reliable brand and material are easy to adjust for the perfect knot position!<br />it feels very elegant!<br /> def buying more
B00GZCCJQA|5|Bought 2 of these dresses for my bridesmaids and I absolutely love them. The seller was quick to help me with a size issue. Overall great would recommend to others!
B0091XSGDK|5|Love these pants, fit perfect. I'm 5'9, 185 with thick thighs and butt. I ordered the XXL, I'm glad I did they run small.
B00A4KTI86|4|Belt is exactly size 36
B003S039NY|5|Excellent Wallet; texture, size, color and etc. all very good quality, with this wallet you don't have to worry about losing your money when you take out the wallet from your pocket!!!
B005OE3E9G|2|This product is not a one size fits all. I am 5'8 165 and it came up to my waist.  If i had stretched it anymore, it would have  snapped.  I was disappointed as it was for my husband's surprise birthday.
B00NOBEB02|1|bizzare fit
B00BIRZ6N0|5|My daughter is a competitive gymnast and spends 5 days a week in a leo. She said this one fit well and is very comfortable. We are pleased.
B00NAXD3ZS|2|Does not have V cuts in bottom of 'sweater' so it will run very tight. It's made of that mesh material you would wear over shoulder pads playing football, very uncomfortable to have on unless something is under it. Everything is painted on, nothing sewen or stitched. I ended up returning mine the next day after receiving it and bought a ps4 game.
B00ITOVXQO|4|its a geat jacket ill just have to remember to order one size up next time so i gave it to my GF since shes smaller than me lol. but i love how the jacket looks and so does my GF haha
B007FZS99W|5|This will be great for vacation, The price was great, I found similar cover ups that were 3 times the price
B0036GB3SI|5|Pants are awesome, just what i wanted. A lot cheaper than trying to order through my place of work. when i need more, ill come back.
B001B9WAKW|3|Just ok, expected more full hair piece
B00EFQN408|3|I wear a size 6, I ordered a size up in this top and it still fit uncomfortably tight. Before I wear it, my husband puts his hands into the arms of the top and stretches it out hard so it is not so uncomfortable. So please, I would suggest ordering 2 sizes up, especially if you have bigger boobs. I am quite small on top. I can't imagine anyone that has large boobs fit into these. the sleeves were very short also. I wish products that came from overseas would make the sleeves longer and if they are going to be sent to American women, how about making them to fit American women. We are not all little bitty short women. I am 5' 7' and the sleeves were too short. I just keep them pushed up. Also, the color is not the color you see on your screen. I is a muted color of blue, just plain old blue. Disappointed to say the least. I would not recommend this product to anyone who has a large bone frame.
B00PUCT5D6|3|Fits a little snug through the hips.  Waist and legs okay.  Thin fabric, hope it holds up.
B003XXXZTO|4|A bit hard to get the squashed form out of it but it looks and fits good.  If only it would hold it's shape better.
B00IL5ZQ8W|5|I love these gowns.  They are made well and fit wonderfully.  I have three and they are all great.
B00BL8JB1Y|2|sent back to big i like a smaller bag did not have size on it when i ordered i liked color
B00TUR4BJK|1|Cool shirt but way too small. Can't wear it. Is this a boys large?
B004SE20OS|5|Son likes these, colors did not come as shown, but it was no big deal to him.
B005LN6MVW|4|somewhat big!
B009UV60OA|4|its cute and soft but i actually bought it for my 2 yr old and it was way to big for her although i guess i probably never looked to check what size it was for it is very soft and cute looks just like the picture
B00GV38QW4|4|The skirt is very nice and fits well
B00BHL2YXC|5|My favorite! Look great and very slimming
B003YUX9JC|2|I love Murray Mints but this bag of candy was a bit stale. I didn't see an expiration date but these must have been past it when I got them.
B00KTFXPN0|5|Pretty and as described.
B005KKAEA6|5|You can't beat Shadowline panties for comfort and style.  They are the only brand I buy now.  All others have been a disappointment.
B005EWG7G0|5|I suggest you get a size bigger if you plan to put a lot of shirts or sweaters under it. Hood is very big and, like previous review stated, can wear a hard hat under it. It is too warm to eval the warmth right now but it is thick, more like a coat jacket than a sweat shirt type zip up.
B0093TELFO|5|Have been looking for a very long time for a suitable mask pin. This one is perfect in size & color
B00LGRZYZ2|4|nice quality small fit
B00FW3BP2W|4|Cute, a little see through but good for the price.
B00CEMKJUS|5|I put it on as soon as I received several weeks ago and have not taken it off!
B0078YYLUG|5|My daughter has the black one. I still need to test it out since we had to exchange hers. Very cute.
B00KR9LYX6|4|fit perfect :)
B00Q530ZF6|5|Great T, Good Fit , gave as gift, unique
B00AHOQEA4|3|Loved them but they shrunk in the wash (none of my Carter brand sleepers had that problem).
B0034KSK8M|5|fast service, came as expected, great price
B00OQ4L3ZW|5|Perfect. Exactly as described.
B008X0IPWO|4|I love the fit and feel of this beer holding hoodie.  It does fit a beer or bottle perfectly, and the lining of the beer pocket helps to keep your drink from sweating and making a wet spot on the shirt.  The fabric is thick and the shirt is warm.  Two downfalls:  the sleeves are short.  I don't have any problems with the length or fit of the shirt overall, but the sleeves are a bit short, considering the size of the rest of the shirt.  The second issue is that the fabric has small spots of a different color in it.  I ordered two of these, and one had white spots, the other had dark grey spots.  This seems like an imperfection in the fabric, but since I bought this for lounging, I didn't care about the spots.  If you're the type that would be bothered by this, don't buy this shirt.
B0049NGS4G|5|Great quality, keep my ears very warm and folds up neatly when not being used.<br /><br />Note: If you have an over-sized head, please consider another product.
B0077E7EY2|1|The shorts were SUPER short. Butt-hanging-out-short. So, if you're into that kind of things, then go for it. I was looking for something a little more conservative.
B008V9DMQ6|5|I'm 6'1&#34; and about 190 lbs, and a fairly athletic build with broad shoulders. This L size jersey fits great. The other aspect that impressed me was that I have slightly longer arms, and this hoodie had the extra length for that!
B00HO5Q4G8|3|The shirt is fine...If you are a GIANT!  Are you kidding me?  I wear a medium in most t-shirts, but this one in a medium was just plain HUGE!  I thought I was sent the wrong size by mistake.  Out of disbelief, I measured it around the chest-it was 50 inches.  Seriously, is that a medium?  My best fitting tanks are more like  38-40 inches.  Again, this shirt is fine, I would like to wear it and it is just what I was looking for, but with this kind of sizing, I would need an XXS.
B00B01HD3A|5|Love it because I am a Whovian and it is cool. I bought it to match my belt that I also bought.
B006NKPH72|3|These things are very small, but warm.  we have a hard time getting them on his hands as they are more for a 1-2 yr old.
B005HF6UD4|5|I bought this for my sister for x mas and she loves it. I bought it last x mas and it is still going on strong.
B002859ISK|5|I bought this shirt for my husband.  He loves skulls, motorcycles and poker...once he cut the sleeves off of the shirt it became his favorite shirt! He looks awesome in it too!!
B00H4IOY8A|5|love
B004GFY99S|5|These are my favorite boxers.  They're very soft and comfortable with a decent amount of length but no to long
B00D3TQPX6|5|Bought for my husband for a hiking trip.  He loves it.  Fits well and well made.
B00GT1ED5C|4|Bought t-shirt for my friend who is a Johnny Cash fan. She is average size but the men's large is snug on her. Other than that the shirt is great. I hope I can exchange it for her without too much hassle.
B004QMLR00|4|Looks amazing.  I love it, though, the &#34;stone&#34; piece fell off as soon as I took it out of the box.<br />Nothing some super glue can't fix!  It looks super great otherwise.
B0086VR8ZA|5|these pants are amazing I've ordered more in different colors I was so happy with my purchase, I'm a size 11 in juniors so according to their sizing chart I have to order a size xl. As long as you follow the sizing chart you won't be disappointed, I can dress these pants up or down with heels, flats, boots or sandals what more could a woman ask for. Also, if you have a boyfriend he won't be able to keep his hands off of your butt or thighs because these pants are made to slim your thighs and enhance your rear.
B003CI1F56|5|I'm very happy with the quality.
B00LF5NHCC|2|I returned this dress. ...it has a strange fit....almost as wide as it is long. Had it not been for the fit it would have been a keeper.
B00HSE31U2|5|This scarf is absolutely perfect for a Mikasa cosplay! The color and length are great and the quality is wonderful!  It also arrived the same week I ordered it, which was a huge bonus! I highly recommend this scarf! I will be using it for my Mikasa Ackerman cosplay this upcoming March! :)
B009TAZ228|1|After the second laundering it is completely &#34;pilled up.&#34; It looks terrible. Do not buy this product it does not wear well.
B00HSYA79U|5|Very comfortable, fabric is soft and breathable. Combine that with the super low price, and it's an all around great tee.
B00N7RS0GO|5|These were for my grandson and I do not know how they fit but they sure are cute!  ....especially for a Paw Patrol fan!
B006SRT1XG|2|The seam from the waistband and the rest of the material after just a few uses.  Otherwise they fit as expected and are OK.  I had to sew them back together when they were still new.
B008BFTBII|5|Nice leather gloves, warmer than my old leather gloves
B008YGVHT0|5|warm warm warm, comfy as.......! I will be buying more. I bought 2xl as I take a 2xl and it is a perfect fit
B009P4QEKC|2|Way to big in the heel, when you put on your shoes they get all crunched up and are very uncomfortable..
B00D7JP3QC|5|I ordered an ex-large. bc I have gained a little weight. im happy I did b/c they fit as expected. made very well. looks great just like the picture. the shipping was great on time. they packed it well. so im happy. I don't think I dried the shirt I hung it up. and I turned it inside out also in the washer.. before putting it in..! lol. I love it.. nothing bad to say about this item.
B00OHY5S4I|1|Came very wrinkled, it is very small. It wouldn't fit a 7 year old in small. I ordered for a 9 year old!  It would take a large to fit! Nice coat though
B00EOYKEEA|4|Cannot carry much but when you need basic ID and a little cash - Works Well
B007ZZDDBG|3|Fits large but I like the larger brim, washes easily, and i definitely need a strap for keeping in on my son's head.  My son's head is in the 50th percentile at 15 months and the 6-18 mon size is still large on him.
B000IIUMNE|5|I love to wear garter belts and these stockings were a joy to wear with it.The fit and feel was great.
B00OGV7NG8|4|Works great to keep u young rolling baby on his back at night and also seems to make him feel more secure and cuddled like swaddling us to. Quality made and the bugs are minky soft. Only issues was it took forever to arrive
B005UT8JQI|5|These are the  most darling socks if you are a chihuahua lover<br />as I am!  I bought 2 pairs of these socks!
B00PI09LL6|1|The fabric is TERRIBLE. It has a rough texture & hangs in a bulky fashion.<br />Nothing about this was flattering. Nothing.
B00B2DLNK0|5|sweet cotton dress. added a pink cardigan and white party shoes & she was all set to go! dress or summer play ok.
B003DBEDF6|5|This is the best jock strap that I have ever worn.  Finding 100% cotton is not always easy, so I was happy to see that this 3-pack is.  They breathe great.  I have a 31 waist and ordered a medium - the fit was perfect and they are very comfortable, keeping everything in order.  The elastic band is just the right size. Papi is always a quality product.  Highly recommended.
B00CBQKCWW|5|For the price i paid, Im so happy.  Fits as expected.  Material is good.  I took a little bit more time that i was expecting, but it worth.
B00MG06QKK|5|Very happy with shirt
B001KKOGNG|5|Got this for my ACU tac vest for hunting and tac target shooting. It's a little darker than the vest pattern but I could care less. Looks good and feels good on the vest and fits anything small enough to fit so I'm happy.
B00AMF0MOC|5|High quality. Washed and dried well. We do lots of laundry and have no time for special care. Great product, and we love the baby banz wrap around polarized sunglasses too!
B00IT2E6SS|5|They only go up to your calf if you're an adult but they're super cute!
B00O7C58DG|5|Gifted and was perfect fit. Beautiful colors
B00LOHW1W8|5|Good looking dress. Comfortable. Color as expected. If you are petite, the dress is a bit above knee. For size 2 the dress is free fit, not slim...
B0092SPPTM|4|My husband really really loves this shirt, good make and well made, the letters are put on well and do not flake after one washing. Very glad to have purchased, word of warning, they shrink easy
B00C5TOYFG|5|I love this romper its true to the photo and fit!  The colors are bright and material is light and comfy.  i had a great experiance with the seller from purchase to dilvery, professional.  thank you! I recomend this item in your true size and recomend this seller!  Happy summer!
B00PJ7VHJ2|4|Got a small even though I'm usually a medium and it fits nice, just like in the picture.  This shirt will probably be too big if you're thin and short.<br /><br />I picked the grey.  It's soft and comfortable; a little cheap looking but for the price I don't mind.  I would buy more.
B00M744A4E|4|I followed the measuring guide but it still took me trying 3 different sizes of these before I found the one that fits and works best.  Bandelettes are a really good solution for thigh chafing and the one I turn to most often since I wear a skirt to work 4 days per week.  Here is what I recommend:<br /><br />DO NOT get the lace ones.  These are the more stylish and sexier option (my husband thought they were great), but I think they are more for show than the plain ones.  I wore my lace pair about 2 times before the materials started to wear thin.  On the 3rd wear I really put it to the test - this was a 12 hour day on my feet for a special event and at the end of the day I had the WORST chafing rash that I have ever had.  It took 2 weeks to heal.  I probably would have been better off if I just went bare legged that day.  I attribute this to the friction from the lace bandelettes plus the fact that the material was really worn through in several spots.<br /><br />That said, I really do like the plain ones.  They work well and are so comfy to wear that it's easy to forget that you have them on!<br /><br />Warning: if you put these in the dryer the silicone strips inside will start to break and come off in threads.  If you want these to last I recommend hand-washing.
B00062NNN8|5|Dumb me, I ordered the wrong size. No problem with this purchase. It was easy to return and reorder the correct size. Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back. This firm is \\"On he Ball\\" when it comes to handling a situation like this.
B00KGOQOXC|5|My wife loved her black pairs so much I had to come back and order a red pair, haha!
B00G0M1SZ8|4|I like the fit and they seem well made. I will likely order these again in other colors.
B0093KTZ90|5|I absolutely love this dress. It was sent from Hong Kong all the way to the United States in no time at all.<br />This dress is gorgeous and I even got a special surprise gift with it. I would recommend this to any drag queen, female over the age of 18 and especially dress lovers.
B00GLQG0JC|4|a bit shorter than i want, but it's ok. looks very baggy around my waist because the cut of the blouse isn't a line, but simply loose from top to bottom, so don't expect to look slimmer in this shirt. but otherwise i'm pretty happy. it's soft and cute. if you don't like your clothes to look too baggy, order a size down.
B0009GA6WC|5|Great value for the price paid.  Comfy shorts to wear at home
B00XH6FV5I|5|I am very pleasantly surprised.  Fit is good love the form of this product, overall extremely satisfied.
B00AF91GVI|3|The bra was very pretty and if I had known the right size to order- I would have kept it.  Anita nursing bras are the best (just make sure to know your size)
B00KLPVUXA|4|Bought this as a joke gift for my sister.  She seemed to like it.  They were higher quality than I would have expected.
B0009J5K66|2|The quality of these bodysuits are fine, however the way it fits is really uncomfortable, the neck is very very large and does not properly cover my baby's chest. I have ordered a pack for 3 months old, and even when my baby is 3.5 months I still can't put them on, because it feels like nothing covers my baby's chest!
B00J2EDUBQ|5|I just love this shirt!  Many compliments when I wear it.  I would definitely recommend it to Beatles fans!  Love it!
B009NQOVZ2|4|I bought this coat as a gift for my sister and had it shipped to her address she opened it on the phone with me and she said \\"omg I luv it\\" \\"its perfect where did u find this\\" \\"its beautiful and I luv luv luv it!\\" It fit her perfectly it arrived on time and was pckged perfectly! No complaints here or there! Lol
