B00003CXIP|5.0|I just finished watching this movie for the fourth time and enjoyed every minute of it not many movies bring back memories of a persons childhood like this one did for me.I had good friends like the kids in the movie,we did many of the same things as far as taking chances. We also had big bullys picking on us. I enjoyed watching the camping part of the movie.  I also enjoyed the comentary extras on the dvd they were interesting.  I thought the acting was good for the actors at their ages. Yes I would watch it again.
1612680011|1.0|The author does a great job of showing everyone how to make boatloads of money - writing an extremely generic, idiotic book and convincing a bunch of people it will revolutionize their lives. Some of the information might be beneficial, but if you're taking the time to buy this you could just as easily google ways to make and keep money & setting a budget. This guy, Tony Robbins, Dave Ramsey, and all these financial 'authors' are a complete fraud. This book shows the easiest way to make a lot of money, write a commonsense book about making money and then market the ever-living crap out of it; sad that this still works in the 2000s.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|In a very unusual way Nicholas,performs an intriguing tale. Some things are impossible in a spiritual sense,which I believe we're overdone. The obsession of the bad husband was overdone to excess,however he died without a murder being committed. Not one of Mr Sparks best

B005D4YOHI|3.0|I've worn the standard open toe Teva sandals for years now, but when I bought my latest pair, I decided to get a pair of these as well since I'd heard friends rave about them.  They fit tight, so I suggest ordering a half to full size up.  They are very well made and I can certainly see why so many people like them, the materials and workmanship seem top notch.  Unfortunately for me, I just couldn't deal with the close toe part of these.  I was really hoping to like them as I have stubbed my toes before when hiking or walking through a stream, but I just couldn't get there...having so much material around my bare toes was not comfortable to me.  It felt like wearing regular shoes with no socks, which is something I can't stand either.  My foot feels like it is going to get all sweaty right away and stay that way...no thanks.  I'm sure the next time I stub my toe, I will be wishing that I were wearing these, but the other 99% of the time I would be wishing I weren't.
B00DM12ANO|4.0|I don't remember seeing the previews for this movie while it was in theatres. Very surprised at the fascinating concept and visual execution. Well worth it!
B004SIP7AS|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much.  I had read the book awhile ago, and thought the movie was a good representation.  The acting was  nicely done. It was good to see an old fashioned love story, with no nudity or foul language.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent book. Now a movie. This is a book set in the future-kinda sci do. But. It is a personal story about a young girl and her line of morality.

1781162646|4.0|Joyland is a refreshing change of pace.  The writing is excellent, as usual.  But the story doesn't leave you looking over your shoulder the way most Stephen King novels tend to do.  If you're expecting a sharp-edged thriller, you'll be disappointed.  If you're expecting a very well-written, easy reading story with a quirky twist, you'll enjoy Joyland.  I did!
B00CJGP116|5.0|After 10 years Marc goes back to his roots.. Salsa. But not just Salsa, inspiring lyrics and inviting songs, to dance, to hear and to share.<br />\\"Vivir mi Vida\\" is a mirror of the same classic Marc Anthony having a good time with his surroundings and his music.<br />Enjoy an outstanding recording from beggining to an end there is not a song you will end up hearing again and again.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I was browsing thru games and ran across this one. Now I'm addicted. I think it's even better than diamond dash and the likes. Plus it's free. I'm a fan.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I think it's a fun game and I enjoy it. I play this game on my kindle fire and it's great to pass the time.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really liked his other two books, but this one surpasses those in pure enjoyment.  His writing keeps you right there on the page, and wanting to press forward, but not to end the relationship.  He writes carefully, and in colorful, descriptive language.
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|I love these types of movies .  lots of  special effects and a good story line i think ..  Maybe  i am just a kid at  heart
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I have always been fond of but not crazy about Sherlock Holmes.  However, I watched this with family and fell in love!  Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch are amazing actors, and the way the series updates the stories for modern times while retaining so many original elements is truly impressive.  The episodes are both tense and edgy AND completely hilarious.
B009WUBERW|5.0|I had never seen this movie.  I loved all the actors . I liked the story line and all the effects were good
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|Saw her perform two songs on Colbert and ordered the cd immediately.  She is amazing, and the cd is one of the best I've bought in years.  &#34;Can You Get to That&#34; rocks, and the vocals/harmonies stir the soul.  She was amazing at the Rally to Restore Sanity, she was amazing in the Staples Singers, and she's amazing here.
B009YN2M7S|2.0|This was the first Nicholas Sparks book I read, and I was so underwhelmed. I knew going into it, the story would be predictable: abused wife meets widower, abusive husband tracks her down. I thought the Katie character was very well conceived, but I wasn't buying the Alex character--dating again after his wife's death almost appeared too \\"easy\\" for him, I just didn't relate or empathize with the character at all. I thought the \\"twist\\" at the end was so stupid and out of place for this book. While clearly people react differently to books, I honestly cannot believe all these five star ratings for this book. If you are considering reading this book, I'd take that with a grain of salt.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|This is a great love story.  Very well acted, very well written. Beautiful scenery.<br />I will buy this movie and watch it again.
B00B4804KS|5.0|what can i say about jurassic park that hasn't already been said. it's a fantastic film & now even better on 3D blu-ray. loved every minute of watching it again. 5 star movie.
B000S1M9LY|1.0|The jest is on the reader of this seemingly infinite book.  Just because you can write a 1000 page book full of run on sentences and void of plot or sympathetic characters, doesn't mean anyone should read it.  Pretentious garbage.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great for my device. Highly recommend for day to day use for calculating bills and quick figures. Easy to use.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This fun game will keep you occupied for hours, and there is very little need to purchase anything. If you like movies or have never even seen them,  this game is fun. The dinosaurs are cool,  and the minigame,  code red. keeps you entertained while waiting for something. Tat it now!

B00C2VIA52|5.0|This is a fun game.  If you like traditional tcg games,  you will like this game. It has a campain and multiplayer modes. Overall this is a fun game that will keep you occupied for hours. Also,  if you like this game you should try Soulforge.

B007JNR4WI|5.0|I think this movie takes me back to a time when the world appeared more innocent. I don't think movies like this would go well in 2013.  While I was in tears by the end...my spirits rouse with the thought of the possibility this could in fact happen to someone...then the bomb fell. Don't what to spoil it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I cannot speak for myself; I gave this set as a gift to my cousin, a seven-year-old boy, who is very &#34;in to&#34; Star Wars. He loved it! I have no regrets. I wanted to get him something special; his parents told me he liked Star Wars and didn't have the set. It was a 'no brainer;' and I am so very glad I purchased it. At the time, the price was excellent ($69). Amazon.com has provided me with some amazing deals over the years; this set was at a great price and the appreciation I received was so very special. THANKS!

B005EGXTEE|5.0|It was impossible to put down and think about anything else than survival. Such dystopian fiction is perfect for any teenager, or still, anyone of any age to immerse themselves in. Collins should be praised for her ability to create such a world that is so cruel, and yet where no reader would want to escape from once lost in it. Our central character Katniss is beautifully vulnerable, a character only considered from long thought and analysis to suit Collins' hostile realm. Read if you need mental and emotional inspiration from Katniss' strength and determination.

B004PVKFR8|5.0|I definitely enjoy listening to this album.  I know I bought it, but I am always on spotify with this on repeat.
B004JHYRP4|5.0|Another classic by Asimov, I've read this book a hundred times and enjoy it just as much the hundredth as the first. It's unusual for Asimov to introduce Aliens as he tends to stray away from them in his major series like foundation and the robot novels. I guess Nightfall also includes aliens but the having three seperate entity's merge together to create a mature life form was super cool!!
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|To be honest I only rented this movie because of my huge crush on hottie Nick Hoult. The acting was very poor, the storyline not so great, and overall just not a very good movie. Ewan Mcgregor did a good job given the constraints but otherwise don't waste your time and money on this one.
0394721772|5.0|this is a classic and was excellently written.  can't wait to use more of the recipes.  It inspired me to cook more.
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|I highly recommend this Dark / Beautiful Film. There are some many hidden meanings , for which some viewers will find unpleasant<br />. Well I do not want to give the plot away , 3D Disc is good most scenes are 2D , but if you keep your eyes relaxed there should be no problem … I will hold to my rating , this film is excellent…. It is just a shame that a lot movies have limited run in the big markets<br />. In My area alone.. has lost four Cinemas ….<br />  Thank You : Everyone
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved the series and had to get this last series to watch over and over again.  Can't wait for the next series to start.
0425252868|5.0|I had a special interest in this story because my father-in-law served in the Luftwaffe during WWII.  The facts in Adam Makos' book are well documented.<br /><br />I enjoyed the read very much.
B003BKF696|5.0|\\"High Violet\\" remains the high water mark for this band, as excellent as \\"Trouble Will Find Me\\" and \\"The Boxer\\" are.  Still remember first hearing \\"Afraid of Everyone\\" on Pandora in wee, bleak hours of the morning. A beautifully grim and haunting wail of a song that has no match on either of the other albums. Hope the band returns, on their next recording, to the unrestrained, outsized, pushing-the-envelope feel of HV.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|If you have seen the movie, this is a great CD to have to refresh your memory on how good the music was to this movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it! So thrilling and awesome! I would recommend it to anyone, young or old Happy or sad, weird or odd.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keeps you guessing you have to use your brain to find missing pieces and solve puzzels. Get ready to get creative because everything is not always as it seems
B003VANOFY|5.0|By far the most comfortable headset i have ever owned, out of the box its a little tight on your head, but after a day or two of breaking it in, its perfect, i can wear it all day without any pain at all (main reason i looked into getting a new headset in the firstplace) Excellent battery life, 2 hours till full charge, then it lasts for 10 hours, the 7.1 surround sound is AMAZING.. crank that bass up and jam to some Tool. and the range on it is pretty far, my computer is in my basement, and i can walk upstairs, get a snack, use the bathroom and even let my dogs outside without it losing signal!  the 3 programmable buttons on the side of it are great, i use it for itunes personally.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I loved this book, when I finished it I was the train on my way to work and all I can remember was telling myself you can't cry here. Nicholas Spark is truly an amazing author.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|[[ASIN:B00DUIBZSK Stars Dance (Amazon Exclusive)]]<br /><br />Greetings Fellow Humans. I usually don't write such a comprehensive review, but this album was really enjoyable, so I thought I'd take the time to write this.<br /><br />First off, let me start with saying that I'm not the biggest fan of Selena Gomez. I think that she is an excellent actress, but singing isn't really up her alley, evidence with her live performances. Nonetheless, I have found her voice to have improved a bit since her albums with The Scene. I have enjoyed several of her singles (Love you like a Love Song, Round and Round, Who Says, Naturally, A Year Without Rain, Come and Get It), but find most of the other tracks on her previous albums fillers. Of course, autotune is still very prominent, but Selena still has that breathey, unique voice that I can't help but enjoy to listen to. While it may not be powerful or able to hit high notes, she still is a very unique singer.<br /><br />That said, I found myself pleasantly surprised when I listened to Selena's songs for Stars Dance when they were released to youtube.<br /><br />Birthday: This song is aimed for Selena's birthday of course (Which was the 22nd I believe), and has a fun beat to it. While this wasn't one of my personal favorites, I still found that I could listen to it when the shuffle setting found it's way to Birthday, instead of skipping it. (Tell 'em that's it my birthday/ Jazz it up! *Beat Break*) Birthday is no musical masterpiece, but it is still a fun, funky pop track.<br /><br />Slow Down: This is one of my favorite tracks on this album. With blends and different sounds, this is a captivating pop melody. For parents though this song has some questionable lyrics: (I just want to feel your body right next to mine, all night long, baby slow down the song/ If you want me I'm accepting applications, so long as we can keep this record on rotation.)<br /><br />Stars Dance: To me, this song is not a winner, and it's not a loser. I find it has a weird beginning with some violin, but it has a nice tune at some parts. While it is repetitive, I like some parts of the Chorus. It has a funky beat to it, but Stars Dance can't really be called a filler. It has a unique tune to it with surrounding sounds.<br /><br />Like a Champion: This song leans towards the filler side, and to me what saves it is the almost Latin style voice Selena uses and beats. Not the worst, not the best. Like practically all songs on this Album, only few are memorable, but none are truly fillers.<br /><br />Come and Get it: We've talked about this song a billion times, moving on. (9/10)<br /><br />Forget Forever: This song commonly mistaken as 'Rule the World', is an excellent song on this album. (Our love was made to the world/ You came and broke the perfect girl) With meaningful lyrics, and a slow yet catchy chorus, this song definitely is one of the best on this album.<br /><br />Save the Day: I personally love this song. it has a generic beat and sounds, and even tune, yet somehow I find myself pressing the repeat button several times on this song. It has a dramatic sort of tune, which I love.<br /><br />B.E.A.T: So their is the whole hype over the whole stealing from Dev's song 'Bass Down Low'. The answer to this I think is that Selena was inspired by Dev's song, as she has already spoken of in an interview. So away from the whole 'stealing' thing, this song is probably the most the most repetitive in the entire album. I'm not sure how many times Selena can sing through a static like voice: (It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed/ I got the lights in my hands and the...B.E.A.T in my face/ B-B-B-Beat in m face x100 :P) It's a nice song, but wasn't a personal favorite of mine.<br /><br />Write your Name: This track has cool beats and lyrics and sounds. She uses some echos and other elements along those lines. I didn't really like the tune, as it was a bit too funky for me. But like I've stated before, no song is really a filler. This song and Birthday are possibly the only songs that I didn't murder the repeat button with. But I didn't murder the skip button either.<br /><br />Undercover: I really love this track. The lyrics are fitting for the title: (You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover)Selena sings a bit high in this song, and I'm sad to say that the result sounds very, very autotuned. While this song is very generic, it is still pop at it's greatest. Another personal favorite.<br /><br />Love will Remember: Okay, so out of this entire album, Love Will Remember is my all time favorite, hands down. Maybe even my favorite Selena songs so far. This song is so heartfelt, and it is a very refreshing break from Selena's usual blaring techno. Her voice is gentle and full of sadness as she sings of obviously Justin Bieber, and wondering about what happened to their love. The tune is infectious, and the bridge is dope. (We used to be inseparable/ I used to think I was irreplaceable/ We lit the whole world, before we blew it up/ I still don't know just how we screwed it up.)This is my favorite song right now, and let's be honest, after hearing this song, who can't but help to love Jelena? The two were obviously in love, and I'm sure many of us hope for their future reunion. Here's to Jelena getting back together! This song is perfection.<br /><br />Nobody Does It Like You: This song is another favorite of mine. The lyrics are fitting and the tune is memorable and catchy. It alternates from a low, raspy, talking sort of verse to a piano chorus. She also hints at Bieber when she states: (Your sexy kind of swag, the best I've ever had)This song is definitely a highlight of this album. The only thing I didn't like was when she hits a semi high note, and it's just so auto tuned it almost hurts my ears a bit.<br /><br />Music Feels Better: This is an almost One Direction sounding song, filled with (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh). This track is just a nicely written, catchy tuned pop song.<br /><br />Come and Get It Remix: Ehh, it's decent. I'm not too big of a fan of remixes, but it's a decent remix, a good club song.<br /><br />All-in-all, Selena Gomez's Debut solo album is no Musical Masterpiece by any means. But if you love her voice, catchy beats, nice lyrics, and blending sounds, without much fillers, than Stars Dance is the album for you. This album is great, and by no means a disappointment.<br />Her songs, thankfully, are no mystery as to who they are about. Unlike Taylor Swift (Not hate at all!) who has dated multiple people in the time her album was released, Selena has been dating [dated? :( ] Justin for 2 years, so it's safe to assume most of these songs are about him.<br /><br />Me personally? I loved this album.  I can honestly say no song was a filler though. Selena has really matured, and I might even have to call myself a Selenator now. Is it possible to a Lovatic and Selenator? According to the youtube comments area, I don't think they can coexist. Hopefully my best friend won't read this; She's a Lovatic that doesn't take defecting or 'betrayal' lightly.<br /><br />It's only 10 bucks buy it you cheapo, You know you want too!:)<br /><br />Lexi (P.S) Does anyone know what B.E.A.T stands for? I'm almost afraid to find out.ller. This song and Birthday are possibly the only songs that I didn't murder the repeat button with. But I didn't murder the skip button either.<br /><br />Undercover: I really love this track.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Touching, great theme, wonderful music.  An odd twist on a love story and loss of love.  Seemed to me that the ending was sad even though it seemed as if both key players got what they wanted -- or did they?
6301607929|5.0|After a bad experience with a 3rd party purchase were I received a bad TV copy on VHS in the fullscreen format no less **** I re-purchased the Online Instant Video of this wonderful movie and YES it is in the original format Letter Box where you can see the widescreen shots of the entire movie.  Thanks Amazon customer service for saving the day.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is a lot of fun but it gets pretty repetitive. Things in game are priced high so you either need to fork over real money or play A LOT. It'd be nice to have something to break up the monotony, like specific achievements that give bonus cash or something.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is certainly the best game ever even though I am not the best at it . I have the highest score run so far with 91347.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Archer is better than ever. How can he keep coming up with this stuff. Be sure to read the first two before this one.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Simple put worked as advertised.  I had to use it a lot during really bad weather and it performed excellently.
B0039A8QVI|5.0|Purchased this earlier this summer and it makes for the perfect relaxing, easy going album to listen to while enjoying the summer!
B001TM14VC|4.0|Streaming is great!  This was the first movie I watched when I started Prime.  F-14's are my favorite.  Go, Navy!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I don't usually look for science fiction and came across this book by accident.  It captured me right away, and it was very absorbing. I was not able to predict the conclusion - loved that. I will probably read the next book in the series now.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Gameloft needs to fix bugs and glitches good gameplay and graphics and storyline but has many major flaws in the game . Needs new update and this needs to be resolved, good game but would even better gameloft fix these glitches and bugs , ridiculous how you have to wait 6 hour's to get health potions and have to use real currency to buy certain items.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|MY DAUGHTER GOT ME &#34;HOOKED&#34; ON DOWNTON ABBEY. I HAVE WATCHED 2 OF THE SEASONS TWICE & CAN'T WAIT FOR THE 4TH SEASON TO COME OUT.
B008220BP2|4.0|It's funny, and scary in the same film. In my opinion you couldn't ask for better. I love the concept and execution of this movie. Hope there's a sequel.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|I have read and reread \\"The Hobbit\\" and the LOTR trilogy- they are classics and by far my favorite works of fiction.  I was beyond excited to see this movie.  However, when they brought in Radagast with the bird poop smeared down his face and twitchy ridiculous behavior I was extremely nervous that a treasure of a story was about to be ruined.  There were also instances where the scenes seemed to drag out a little bit too long.  It was almost as if P. Jackson did not turn down any ideas thrown at him- especially in the goblin sequence.  The goblins were made to be almost comical- not scary- and the scene where the dwarves flee the goblin underground was drawn out and annoying.<br /><br />Fortunately, there are many redeeming aspects of this movie.  \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" has always been my absolute favorite section of the book, and they nailed it here.  I did regret that they did not show the green glow in Gollum's eyes when he feels suspicion about the ring, but they stayed very true for the most part.  I'm also extremely excited to see how the necromancer storyline plays out- it is referenced in the book, but we never learn more about it.  Gandalf just suddenly abandons the dwarves and hobbit to go drive him out and that is all we know.  I can't wait to actually see this.  I also really enjoyed the additional scenes at Rivendell with Sauron, Galadriel, and Elrond.  It makes sense to feature them since they play such a huge part in the LOTR trilogy.<br /><br />Overall, it is really well done.  There were just a few snags.  I hope they tweak a few things before the next films come out.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book.  This is my third time reading the books in 2 years and will reread them again when the third movie comes out.
1591791707|3.0|One of the CDs is incomplete. It would be most interesting if all the CDS were complete. I did not listen to it immediately, I waited until I read the book and then it was too late to return them.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It's great for when my niece comes to visit...and my mother enjoys it as well. It has great picture. It takes a long time to load though.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|The best song on this 9 song cd is Thursday-this should be released as a single it has a perfect pop/dance feeling. I was sitting on the computer dancing around and did not even know it until the third play of this song! Lol Other 5 out of 5 songs are Axis, Love Is A Bourgeois and The Last to Die.<br /><br />There is not a bad song of the nine released. You will love if you are a diehard Pethead like I am.<br /><br />To Pet Shop Boys-release Thursday as a video and single it is perfect!
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|I saw it for the second Time and it was better the second time. I would watch it again tomorrow.
B004KKYX9K|5.0|Love that I have to have a think about what I'd do if I were involved...great reading and great moral questions
B00B5AIB14|4.0|I have gathered up a couple of Marley's CDs recently and like this on for several of the takes.  The first disc is good, but the second doesn't seem to have the quality with respect to recording that the first does.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|i bought this for my wife to access hotspots 250-300 ft away from my apartment window. i coupled it with the 7 db panel antennas from alfa. works great. I can see about 75 wifi signals on my block (many large apartment buildings) and the free hotspot i was seeking. havent tried it with bt5 r3
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun and the characters have so much personality. this game is so fun and still action packed. it makes you feel like your in the movie
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun. Very fun. It is really quite fun. I love birdies. Fun. Fun<br /><br />Fun. Fun. And fun. Wow.<br />Cool. App
B0000VCZKM|3.0|The older grand daughter understood the movie but some of the lines were still not exceptable in my eyes but we did get through the movie and certain lines were explained.  I had forgotten most of the movie as I had watched it many years ago but all in all the movie was enjoyed.
0061122416|5.0|An engrossing story that helps us believe in the power of intuition, faith, and taking chances in order to follow our dreams and be true to ourselves.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It's great for killing time. It's entertaining and a bit competitive if you've got friends who also play. The minions are funny and the fluffy unicorn is so darn fluffy! ;)
B0073TZ1AA|1.0|I have documents in different languages and I did not know that only English was supported in this application, I was very disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is very fun &amp; challenging.  it changes things frequently which keeps you on your toes.  great graphics.  surprisingly good game for free!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have all of the previous movies and was awaiting this one.  I love the entire series and it lived up to my expectations.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another cliff hanger but amazing book. I have fell in love with all main charters. You should start from the beginning to truly enjoy it.
B000SEI230|5.0|Yet another good book by Sparks. The movie doesn't do the book justice. Can't wait to get started on the next one....once I figure out which on  it will be!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a great little flashlight app. So beautifully simple. I love that I can customize the color palette of the light so I'm not disturbing others when i need the whole screen of up. Who knew this could be so handy? I use it almost every day!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I am not an avid reader by any means but have come to love Nicholas Sparks' books.  I absolutely couldn't put this book down. I am anxious to see the movie but have doubts it will be as good as reading the book.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I downloaded the free version which is wonderful.  I only upgraded because I feel it is such a gr8 app that I wanted 2 help support those who developed it.  put my music on and slip it under my pillow.  really helps me sleep and requires no wi-fi 2 use.
0385339704|4.0|An interesting book that moves pretty quickly.  Although the story has a legal context, it is not a typical Grisham courtroom thriller.
B000UAE7RW|5.0|Very good movie showing the depth of corruption among millionaires  and their influence on communities.  Also police actions that result in innocent killings.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The game is fun. I experience a little lag at times on my kindle fire hd, but otherwise no problems. I have played the game off and on for two days without spending any \\"real\\" money. Good free app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are amazing and I love the easy competitions. I have been waiting for the perfect app. And now it's here on my kindle. You will love this app and should really get it.
0061537969|5.0|The book really caught my attention within the 2wks I read it and had an amazing outcome too at the end.
B0064W67IM|5.0|Just as incredible as I remembered a great piece of literature. This is not your father's comics. A grat entry onto the world of comic literature and incredible Gaiman story telling
B000EXZI14|5.0|All their best songs which was probably one of the last times we could see all of them together. They are one of the top three groups of all time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well put together cast, Love Maggie @!!!!! Cannot wait for season 4-All of the actors are fab and well placed in the characters they play= lookout big name Hollywood peeps-you got nothing on Downton!!!!!!!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a story of total commitment and training<br />in the Seals.  The events that follow justify the<br />brutal training endured.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Although a little bit of a downer, great topic and great book.  Author does a great job creating characters.  Highly recommend, for any age.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I'm totally addicted to Mahjong and this is a nice challenging version. The only issue I have is distinguishing the seasonal and flower tiles. I would still recommend this app.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|entire book now that think about it it was ok but just not into mysteries. make believe husband was a nut
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very addicting, I play every day, just wish I knew how to get second power up. It is a must get game. I have temple brave also but this is the one I keep coming back to
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I play a lot of these types of games and this was by far one of my favorites. It was challenging and had an interesting storyline. If you like these types of games, I would recommend this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love games like this that involve finding clues and solving puzzles. I played through all ten levels on a roadtrip and my only complaint is that I want more levels! The puzzles aren't super challenging, but they do keep your mind working.
B0055S348W|5.0|Always prints what I need and I've used it on 3 phones.  Excellent, excellent app.  Worth every penny and more.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard has been my go to keyboard above all other proprietary pre installed keyboards. The option to learn from the social media outlets I use and from text messages sent is a god send.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Great little sweeper....easy to handle...keeps the charge....has a very small waste bin but it's simple to empty....tried the swifer sweeper and this is so much better....
B0055Q5F36|1.0|I ordered 2 for Christmas gifts and it did NOT fit the Samsung Galaxy 2 phones.  Sent them back and could not get a cash refund had to take a credit.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Helloooo. Tell me why GOOD music like this is not played on radio for all public to hear? Instead we have to listen to all the crap, seriously? I just love this group. Not one song disappoints!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The new version took a wonderful weather app and turn it into a user unfriendly, quirky, CRAP-APP, that has as its main purpose to be a platform for more advertising.
0374533555|5.0|Every decision maker must read this one! Kahneman takes you through all the mental frailities that lead to poor choices and offers a possible conscious way to avoid them.  Though being conscious of every decision is nearly impossible, it does increase awareness of the pitfalls!<br />Must read.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love that I can take a book with me and not have to carry it.  In fact I can take a lot of books with just one device.  I even downloaded it on my kids tablets, for kids books.  I only gave it four stars because only some books are available.  I continue to find books that are not available for book readers.  My other complaint is that some kindle books are the same price as a real book, which means that shipping and paper are worth nothing?!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Shelock is a great thriller that captures ones attention. One cannot watch only one episode. The series is clean and exciting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just so good!  I can't begin to explain how much I enjoyd this book.  I'm a fan of Suzanne Collins.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing I loved the other books but this one outshines them all in my opinion! A must read!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I will read it again and again!  Ms. Collins nailed it.  Her development of characters was dead on.  I can't wait to read it again.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It's exactly what I needed to play with my playstation. Not sure I have anything else to say, but what else is there really?
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Loved his music. This has everything. Even the stuff from Miami Vice. The only thing you need to complete your Phil Collins is a Genesis greatest hits.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time years ago and I can't believe it's taken me so long to own it myself. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and every single person I've showed it to has been blown away by it. For those of you not familiar with anime or Japanese features, it's something like a Disney film, but with certain aspects very different. It's a story like no other, incomparably drawn.
B006P0FD4W|5.0|I very much enjoyed the movie.  I like horror/ghosts/paranormal films.I cant wait for the &#34;conjouring to come out!  Also Paranormal Activity 5 also. Barbie
B007REV4YI|3.0|Good movie, but not as good as we were expecting from reviews.  Just did not meet the hype we had read about this new Bond movie.
1433502410|5.0|This version was recommended by my Pastor.<br />I enjoy all the presentation, concordance, study helps, and maps.<br />I would recommend this product to anybody who is interested in studying the Bible.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I read a lot. I generally read a book a week and Choose Yourself is one of the best I have read over the past few years. James has had a few big successes and many more failures, which means he has a lot of wisdom to share. While the book is not incredibly long, it is jam packed with practical, and easy to implement, advice. Reading Choose Yourself felt more like reading a novel than a business book. You will be hard pressed to find another business book that elicits emotions the way this one does. His unique storytelling ability will cause you to laugh, become anxious and even cringe at times, mainly because of how honest and transparent he is while sharing his ups and downs. Anyone who worked with the Wu-Tang Clan, been flat broke and then managed a hedge fund (with a lot in between), has a worldview relatable to just about all walks of life. Some of what he shares will reinforce what you already know and a lot of it will offer you a fresh new perspective (and these things will be different for just about everyone). Bottom line, buy this book, strap on your seatbelt and learn how to take more control over your destiny.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Speedy. This thing chews through all my applications and games. Had it for a couple of weeks and no regrets. Worth the price.
B008645YEE|5.0|Who like instrumental music, it's the worth buy this CD! The ship in Brazil was faster (there was a little problem with the package) but nothing more.buy this CD!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This series is so great. If you have been watching the series on HBO, then you can easily get into the books. The writing gets you into the story full steam ahead. It may seem long when you start it, but soon enough it starts seeming short based on how involved you get. Can't wait to get into the rest of the series. Very easy read, once you know who's who and who's not.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I knew that I would'nt put this down till the end... I will remember this for a long time. Sometimes you give and give, and yet you get more than you thought possible.
B003E48AYC|1.0|I PURCHASED THIS DVD COMBO A WHILE AGO--BUT HAD IT ONLY A FER WEEKS WHEN IT STARTED TO SKIP PARTS OF THE DVD. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS MY BLUE RAY PLAYER--BUT IT WASNT. MAKE SURE YOURS WORKS BEFORE THROWING AWAY THE PACKAGING!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|i read really bad reviews about it but when i ordered it it was great,But the only thing is when you put it in it comes out not that easily
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is a great time app, sort of. I mean it takes some time to do things like incubating a dragon or growing food, but it kept me playing for a llllooonnnggg time.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It's a very good game.. with fantastic graphic and interesting storyline. I haven't found bad sides of this game yet and hope never will.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|Totally great movie worth every penny. You can't go wrong with Johnny Depp clip, a great musical with amazing features ans great characters.
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|Having already bought a Dr. Whooves, I had to complete the set with a Derpy.  Her tail is particularly well sculpted.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This app is a little hard to get use to. It did not carry over as easy as I would have wanted.
0545259088|5.0|She loved all 3 books in the series.  As soon as she finished one, she was bugging me to order the next.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is a great way to keep in touch with friends, also meet new friends and learn about different products.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|It is an amazing game nice length, very interesting. I can't wait for the second one. Big fish games are usually pretty good. This game lives up to that.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|this is a well thought out game. This is a gene that is fun to go back and play often.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series of three books engaged my (not usually a motivated reader) 14 year-old daughter to read non-stop. She loved it so much she wanted me to read it which I did and also found entertaining.
B006OAB2XO|5.0|I Love this Cd, It is so well made each song is Both Mystic ambient and creates a fantasy world inside your imagination. I recently had to drive my family to Denver from Durango, CO (7 Hour Drive) and on the way back I realized My brother accidentally took my MP3 adapter for the car with him and I had No music, But I had brought 'Grimes&#62;Visions' CD with me and thought 'Well I guess I can listen to this a few times for the trip' but only intended on listening maybe twice, Well I ended up listening to it for the entire 7 hour drive back! It's that good! 100% recomendation.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series of three books engaged my (not usually a motivated reader) 14 year-old daughter to read non-stop. She loved it so much she wanted me to read it which I did and also found entertaining.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This was bought because I have a niece whose name is Victoria. Here again I wanted my great grand children to see a part of history, and also that their cousin's name was  Victoria. ME
0762445262|3.0|I had read about how small it was, but you have to see it to believe it.<br />It's tiny. It kind of works, but it has to be pretty close to the wall.<br />It looks cool design-wise. The included small book is okay for a quick look.<br />Maybe if you were a die-hard Batman fan you would like it better.<br />I was going to give this to my brother to go with the 24+ inch Batman<br />figure I got him, but I won't due to its size and such.<br />Too bad it's not bigger. Maybe it would be okay for a G.I. Joe / Barbie -sized figure.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Here again this was bought for my great grand children to see. You cannot buy The Rabbit stories except in antique shops and are very expensive. But they were my grand children in latter years favorite stories.  ME
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I took up this book immediately after finishing American God. Although this fairy tale is different from that, Gaiman represents that happy group of writers who blends a facile grasp of the interplay of language with superb imagination and storytelling skill. His characters are compelling and the challenges they face entertaining and enlightening. The only question now is which of his novels to take up next.
B0008ENICU|4.0|This is an old favorite. But it not one I would want to see often. Old timers would probably like it as a remembrance of the stars in it.
1455121924|5.0|Diagnosed as gluten intolerant several years ago, I rationalized my decision to keep eating wheat by telling myself that &#34;at least I don't have celiac disease.&#34;  When I could no longer avoid the fact that gluten was making me miserable, I changed my diet and got this book.  I feel better than I have in years and I can't believe how many unexplained health problems from recent years all seem to be tied in with gluten.  Highly recommend!
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|I like history and had not been able to see this when it came out and kept thinking I would buy it. ME
B000XUBFE2|2.0|I chose this book on friends' recommendations.  It was more than depressing.  The only character I really liked was Papa.  I wanted to like it but found it too disturbing.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I think the overall structure of this book, which is fragmented into multiple stories about the lives of people who touched each other unknowingly, is less about that overarching story and more about what consciously or unconsciously motivated a character's decisions. Initially, I felt that the story was disjointed. However, when I really thought about what tied the vignettes together, It occurred to me that it was how people decided to act that was the common theme. Enjoyed the book for its insights into human behavior. Makes me want to examine my own life more closely. Would recommend this book but don't expect all of the loose story ends to be tied up.
1781162646|5.0|She loved it. She has been a huge Stephen King fan for years and really enjoyed this book. Different style for him.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I like how easy it is to find a word and the meaning.  Very useful.  Helps my hubby with his vocabulary.  User friendly is the only way to go.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I reallu do like this alarm. I think it's got a lot of customizable options that makes it worthwhile. Here's my issue. It doesn't bring my Kindle out of &#34;Sleep&#34; mode. I have to press the power button, unlock my Kindle and then turn off the alarm. Additionally, the alarm is so quiet at the start that it doesn't wake me up immediately. It takes a minute or 2 before I even hear the alarm...but for me, that may be worth only  half star,  since I am snoozing anyway
0736092269|5.0|It doesn't have all of the exercises you might see people doing at gyms or listed in programs, but as it says, it's &#34;Strength Training&#34;, it shows what muscle groups are worked with particular exercises and gives very good plain English advice and tips on how to perform those exercises that are perfect for the beginner (like me), to be able to get on track quickly.
0802473156|5.0|This is a must read book. I enjoyed this book, it has helped me to understand how best to love the people in my life. I have given/recommended this book to friends and have received much thanks. This book is easy to read and understand, and once you learn the love language and apply it you will be well on your way to improving your relationships.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I do not like that the started presenting ads on this app. The ads cover up the information about the weather.
0060833459|5.0|Practically every management idea we now take for granted came from the remarkable mind of Peter Drucker.  But, alas, Drucker's style can sometimes be a bit, well, turgid. This is his most readable and most genuinely interesting book. If you haven't read it,  you're not as effective as you could be.
1592402690|5.0|Just what I was hoping for - a narrative of how the Beatles recorded many of their greatest works, and equally fascinating, an account of how they worked with one another.  Particularly critical of Harrison as a guitarist, but does not fail to credit him for his preeminent work on Abbey Road.  Recommended
B006LSZECO|5.0|A friend suggested this book and I'm glad she did. Definitely worth reading. I think I'm going to pick up another book by Flynn.
0553801473|5.0|Martin at his best.  Riveting twists and turns to an engrossing plotline, fully realized characters and wildly brutal.  Thanx.  I'll be back
0670033375|5.0|Fast shipping, excellent condition and great value!! I purchased this book for a Topics in Sciences class as part of undergrad Business program. It is a great book for anyone interested in how the past can be an indicator of the future. It is a powerful study on what happens when societies squander resources, ignore signals that the environment gives us (global warming) and how other human behaviors such as war, poor business practice and mining effect the environment. It also touches on what some societies have done right. Great book for anyone interested in or getting into &#34;Green&#34; Business!!

B0084B0656|5.0|Chesterton was eye-opener about the Christian faith for me.  His writing style reminds me PG Wodehouse with analysis of &#34;modern&#34; social trends of the early 20th century that is still valid today.  With todays relativist view that whatever the poles show must be right since it is &#34;fair&#34; we all need to read and think about the consequences of pop culture applied to democracy, education and religion.  Chesterton is a great resource and Orthodoxy will make you think.  People who really are comfortable with &#34;light&#34; religion that teaches that truth is whatever the majority of the congregation likes and who want theology that makes no demands will not like Chesterton - but should read him anyway.  The writing style of early 20th century England in general, and Chesterton in particular, takes initial effort (like Tolkein) to get used to the long sentences and the vocabulary but this pays off.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I find in my old age I never actually go to a theater to see a film.  I wait until it comes out on Blu-ray, and now that I have a 3D TV, I buy almost every film in 3D (even if 3D does bother my wife).<br /><br />WRECK-IT RALPH is amazing, not just for the wonderful animation, but the story as well.  It's a story of the \\"bad guy\\" in an old arcade game that is living on borrowed time.  Ralph (John C. Reilly) goes to meetings of a sort of AA group for villains of arcade games, but he's determined to not be thought of as a bad guy.  The other characters in his game, \\"Fix it Felix,\\" don't want to associate with Ralph, and give him no credit for wrecking things so the game has a reason to exist so Felix (a really nice handiman) can fix-it.  Felix gets a medal each time he saves the day, and Ralph feels he'll be accepted if he can get a medal.  He sneaks into a commando game, and breaks all the rules to finally win a medal, but in the process releases a \\"bug\\" that he accidentally introduces into the sugary-sweet game of \\"Sugar Rush\\"  Stuck in that game, and searching for his medal, he meets the Glitch, aka Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), an outcast who is adorable and irritating at the same time.  She is determined to win an upcoming race, and Ralph sees her winning as the only way to get his medal back - until King Candy convinces him otherwise.<br /><br />The rest of the film is brilliantly funny plot points and endearing moments as Felix and the Commando leader search for Ralph and the bug, and Ralph realizes that Vanellope is really meant to be the main character in Sugar Rush, and fights to make things right.<br /><br />This film is amazing, and a wonderful work of animation from Walt Disney Feature Animation.  It is to Disney's credit that, even after acquiring Pixar, they continue to also turn out wonderful animated films in their Animation division.

B004JK61K0|4.0|I have really liked this product since loading it on my Motorola Droid phones over the past couple of years.  I currently have a RazrMax.  However, one of the recent upgrades has really messed it up and K9 people even mention complaints in their recent materials.  But they say they can't find a phone that duplicates the problems.  Well, I have one and the mail retrieval speed reminds me of the dial up days.  It's painfully slow to show the email content and very slow to delete.  I'm thinking of removing the program it's so annoying.  Can anyone help?
B008JFUQZ2|2.0|America has not had much success with giant monster movies.  \\"King Kong\\" is probably our proudest achievement, but it's not really a monster movie in the same vein of the \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"Gamera\\" series. The biggest difference is that the genre involves two behemoths battling it out -- so while \\"Cloverfield\\" demonstrated that a giant monster could be terrifying, it wasn't a legitimate entry into the giant monster genre. Guillermo Del Toro decided to fix that with \\"Pacific Rim.\\"<br /><br />Giant robot battles have been gracing the screen since the \\"Transformers\\" franchise launched, so it was just a matter of time before someone threw monsters in the mix.  And that's exactly what we get, several arena battles between Jaegers (a name for giant robots that first debuted in the [[ASIN:1896776329 Heavy Gear role-playing game]]) and Kaiju (the traditional Japanese name for giant monsters).  Awesome, right?<br /><br />Well, yes, if you just want to see impractically-designed and operated giant robots fight blurry monsters in the water.  The battles -- when it occasionally hits land -- is epic.  While it doesn't have quite the same heft of the destruction in \\"Man of Steel,\\" Kaiju fans will finally get what we've all been waiting for...CGI conflicts between titans that looks awesome on screen.<br /><br />But it's not as fantastic as it could be. The more interesting Jaeger designs are never used to their full potential; what you see in the trailer is pretty much all of it.  The Kaiju are almost impossible to distinguish because they're all gray in the rain, in the ocean, and underwater. Given that the Kaiju come from an interdimensional rift, they seem impractically designed to survive underwater. The Jaegers are no better.  It occurs to exactly nobody that maybe they should design a killer submarine to take on the monsters underwater...in fact, there's not even the slightest hint of any naval military capability whatsoever.<br /><br />SPOILER RIM: And who needs them anyway when you have giant robots? Earth's united forces decide, at what can only be described as a plot gimmick, to just give up on the Jaeger program.  Why?  I was expecting some kind of accidental murder of a bajllion civilians like what we witnessed in \\"Man of Steel,\\" but instead we get...politics and economics.  Or to put it another way, the same military industrial complex that builds the Jaegers and has success killing them has its funding yanked in favor of a wall that demonstrably doesn't work. Not a single country on our fractious planet dissents.<br /><br />But let's put aside all of that for the moment and focus on the plot. Jaegers are piloted by another staple of the genre, a mind-meld that requires two pilots working in sync known as \\"the drift.\\" It's a pretty cool idea and fun to see on screen, as the two pilots experience each others' dreams and nightmares.  These teams are very close: brothers and sisters, fathers and sons, husbands and wives.  When Raleigh Becket's (Charlie Hunnam) brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) dies during combat, they're still connected and the experience scars Raleigh for life...until he is inevitably lured back into the program as part of a last ditch effort to stop the Kaiju army once and for all before the Jaeger program is cancelled and humanity gives up and dies.<br /><br />But who will be his copilot? Pretty Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) is obviously the perfect match -- she's smart, athletic, and capable of keeping up with Raleigh.  And yet leader of the program Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) refuses to let her participate.  When Stacker finally does relent, I was looking forward to Mako kicking some ass and taking names.<br /><br />Instead, we get one of the most offensive female Japanese stereotypes in recent memory.  She pouts, she wells up in tears, and she is a huge liability to the team.  It's clear that women have no place in director Guillermo Del Toro's vision of a robot future that has more to do with brains than brawn -- the women's emotions will just get in the way.  There are several opportunities for Mako to rise above all this, but she never does.  Even though she's standing right beside Raleigh, the plot finds ways to make Mako helpless and ultimately, require rescue.  Sorry girls, you can be a master martial artist with an advanced degree and still not save the world.<br /><br />Putting aside the casual disregard for women, the nonsensical plot that could easily have been fixed, and the attempts at humor that even Ron Perlman can't save, the movie hits a new low when an EMP disables some of the Jaegers and Raleigh Jaeger, the Gipsy Danger, is unaffected.  Why?<br /><br />\\"They're digital.  The Gipsy Danger is analog.  Nuclear.\\"<br /><br />I'm sorry, what?  Yes, electronics made in the 1950s were made to withstand the EMP of a nuclear attack and are thus more resistant.  Jaegers didn't exist then.  Even though the Gipsy Danger is \\"atomic-powered,\\" it has electronics.  And the Kaiiju who fired the EMP apparently knows this, because it never bothers to try its pulse again.  It's a gaping plot hole in a sloppy script that could easily be rectified with a few tweaks.<br /><br />But the robot battles are fun.- the women's emotions will just get in the way.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|Love that the movie shows the back story behind Professor X and Magneto, even if there are some inconsistencies in the time line when compared to the X-Men Quadrilogy. The movie shows how both men arrived at their very different point of views.
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|Extender works well but configuration / setup is not simple. I am an IT pro and it was not straight forward. I recommended to friends and they gave up. Be prepared it is not a wizard based setup.

B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Luca Rossi has got the special talent to tell stories you don't expect in a way which is similarly unexpected. Each one of these short stories is characterised by this peculiarity, while you face completely different worlds and protagonists, each one able to amaze you in its own way. Moving among science fiction, fantasy and erotism each story captivates you and meets your desire of a narration which is less than expected, where really everything can happen.<br />Suggested to Sci-fi enthusiasts who would like to be surprised.<br /><br />Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author of [[ASIN:B00L979374 Red Desert - Point of No Return]]
B00E00P5JC|4.0|It only struck me recently that now that I have a five-year-old I could take him to pretty much any kid's movie under the slightest pretense.  This is exhilarating -- I hadn't read up too much on what \\"Turbo\\" was about besides the fact it featured...ya know, a snail. And that's pretty much what I got.<br /><br />Here's what you need to know: \\"Turbo\\" is actually about brotherly relationships.  Snail Theo (Ryan Reynolds) dreams of becoming a race car driver like his hero Guy Gagne (Bill Hader); his workaday brother Chet (Paul Giamatti) disapproves.  They have good jobs in a human family's tomato garden, but it regularly involves being carried off (AKA eaten) by realistically-rendered crows.  My son was unfazed by this, so mission accomplished.<br /><br />When a freak accident transforms Theo from a hopeful snail to speed demon Turbo with a pimped-out shell, things take a surprising turn.  Instead of following the typical superhero plot by trying to hide his special nature from adults (read: humans), Turbo immediately embraces his new superpowers and becomes the literal and figurative vehicle that propels another plot: two human brothers trying to make it big.<br /><br />Dreamer Tito (Michael Pena) believes Turbo can enter the Indy 500 and bring fortune and fame to the Starlight Plaza while his more practical brother Angelo (Luis Guzman) harangues him for not making tacos.  Rounding out the human population is a parade of ethnic stereotypes: tough autobody shop owner Paz (Michelle Rodriguez), hobby store owner Bobby (Richard Jenkins), and most offensive of all, nail salon owner Kim Ly (Ken Jeong, pretending to be a little old fat woman). But never mind that, this is a movie with urban heart -- and we know that because it has Snoop Dogg as snail Smoove Move.<br /><br />The Starlight gang decides to escalate to switch from snail racing to the real thing.  Yes kids, this is a real thing. And so the humans pool their money and go on a road trip to get Turbo entered into the Indy 500, accompanied by kooky supporting snails: Whiplash (Samuel L. Jackson), Burn (Maya Rudolph), Skidmark (Ben Schwartz) and White Shadow (Mike Bell). These snails are a crazy catalyst to push the plot along when things get boring.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, it works. Between the point-of-view car racing, the insane snail antics, and the occasional harangue by an older brother who knows better (snail or otherwise), \\"Turbo\\" speeds along at a good clip.  It's also the first movie that kept the boy's attention through the entire film.<br /><br />There's quite a bit of naive optimism in \\"Turbo\\" that goes unspoken.  Nobody ever shows up to dissect Turbo even though he's plastered all over television.  And although technically Tito is out to exploit Turbo for cash, it feels more like two hopeless romantics helping each other achieve their dreams.  \\"Turbo's\\" conclusion is a surprisingly close race that plays for keeps -- which is saying a lot for a film about a superpowered snail in the Indy 500.<br /><br />Hobby fans will be amused by Bobby's comment that the Indy 500 is \\"bigger than Hobbycon!\\" Or bigger than Gen Con, which takes place in Indianapolis too.  And kids...well don't take my word for it. My son said it was his favorite movie.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Ocean at The End of the Lane opens with this quote from Maurice Sendak: \\"I remember my own childhood vividly. I knew terrible things. But I knew I mustn't let adults know I knew. It would scare them.\\" Here's a hint: this quote pretty much explains the whole story that comes after it...except for the \\"vivid\\" part. The reliability of memory is a critical element of this story. Anytime a book opens with a nod to Sendak, I expect it to be particularly good. I expect the author to share a similar sort of Sendakian insight. When that author is Neil Gaiman, there's a pretty good chance that's what a reader will get.<br /><br />The story's unnamed Narrator (who I couldn't help but think of as Gaiman himself) goes back to his childhood home in Sussex, England, to attend a funeral. An indistinct compulsion urges him to seek out the Hempstock farm that is located at the end of the lane he lived on as small child. When he reaches the farm he is greeted by an old woman he vaguely remembers. She's either the mother or grandmother of his childhood friend,(he can't remember at first) Lettie Hempstock. He asks the old woman if he may go out back and visit the pond. The old woman remembers him and agrees to let him come in and reminisce for a while. There begins the narrator's flash-back to his boyhood days when he discovered that very ancient beings, some older than the moon, live in this world and they came here through the Hempstock's pond, which Lettie had always insisted was not a pond, but an ocean...and a gateway to another dimension.<br /><br />This book is about how a child's naivete and innocence gives them the basis to accept that magic exists and are therefore able to interact with it. That same naiveté and innocence also lends to the extreme fears and nightmares children must suffer as they struggle to cope with the unknown. In real life, that is all rather metaphoric, but in Ocean at the End of the Lane it is very, very real. If there is anyone who knows how to capturethe true darkness and fear of childhood, while also holding on to the magic and wonder of it, it's Gaiman.<br /><br />The Ocean at The End of the Lane started out as Gaiman's response for a request for a short story, but then it turned into something more. Gaiman refers to it as a novel. That might be a bit grandiose. I would call it a novella. Word counts and page numbers do not matter, though. Do I want a king size Snickers bar, or a snack size Snickers bar? Who cares, I'm just so freaking happy to have a Snickers bar. Short or long, Gaiman packs so much into his stories that they're satisfying either way.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Nice book! I enjoyed reading this condensed book.  Took little tome to get the whole story. Easy way to understand the story.
0316017930|4.0|This nonfiction piece was the required reading for students taking AP Language in the fall at our local high school. I read it so I could work with a young girl I mentor.As a former high school English teacher, I found it very engaging- a difficult task for non fiction writers. My teen reader also liked it.
159463176X|5.0|Rather than summarize the book, which I could never do justice, I will say this book is a huge gift.  Each chapter is its own short story with a common thread of family, duty, honor and Afghanistan.  The people in each story are related to each other in some way be it blood or friendship.  I felt like the writing was so beautiful, the stories so rich, I was opening a box within a box, within a box of gifts, some more precious than others but when put together, a treasure.
B000002HHB|4.0|Wonderful music very enjoyable!<br />Natalie is one of my favorite music artists ever.<br />This is worth having in your collection.
B0061PEAUY|1.0|I found this a very boring book. Not worth spending your money or your time. It feels as if it was written by some talentless writer following a formula and not even able to do this correctly. I will never buy a Kahy Reichs novel again.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This gets more time than most other games on my Kindle. Tip of the hat to the DEV. A great and easy to play game for all ages.
B0053O89KG|5.0|My favorite show and one of my favorite seasons.  Couldn't wait for this one to be released.  Have really enjoyed it!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Fun games that are a challenge and keep your interest. Each level becomes harder to get through. Enjoy it will be fun
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|my grand son just loves this fast coming to house and he has watched it a lot of times w
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I loved that this movie has so much heart.  There's a soft center to this movie and it's not too often in movies anymore.  I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it.
B0012CH350|5.0|I have owed numerous grills and all there covers fray, tear, and fade over time.  Weber covers stay looking clean and good regardless of the weather!!
B005KELW26|5.0|Love it.... love the color and love how it protects my Kindle!  I don't worry about it getting dropped or scratched with this cover on.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|The movie was really good, but it was really frustrating as it loaded about a million times. It wasn't our internet speed because all other devices worked fine...it was the amazon roku app messing up.
B000002J0B|5.0|just such a lovely album, one of zeppelin's best. i think that you need this one, number 4, and the song remains the same at a minimum.
B00632HWOG|4.0|An interesting scenario that is both believable and exciting. A well written book that will keep your interest from start to finish.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|This is a great collection of Stills music over a few decades. There is songs on this boxed set that aren't even in production any longer, or the original albums have been retired. Great listening. Great buy!
B000M4RG42|5.0|This is a great patriotic DVD. It worked as one would expect perfectly. Really enjoyed the movie. Great action and actors.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This product is exactly what it advertises. Simply fantastic. I originally had a mouse wheel problem with it but once I contacted Anker support, it was fixed within days. Simply amazing. The mouse is definitely worth buying.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|love this. please add me. I need more neighbors. DTXTNFR. also it will not let me add people. I type in their id and it does nothing.
B008CP6RWU|2.0|I won't deny that the game looks great and sounds great. I bought it specifically to enjoy on my TV and sound system. Once I finished the game the first time through, I thought to myself, did I miss something? I went and read all of these glorious reviews about how the game made people cry yada yada yada. So I gave the game another shot, found as many glyphs as I could and although I did enjoy it better the 2nd time around, I'm getting what cash I can for this and running away. I find no lasting value in this game, no purpose, nothing. I played flower for a few minutes and won't even give that another try. In my long history of thoroughly researching my games so I don't make a costly mistake, I finally made one. Good riddance.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Ok, some of these movies were downright cheesy! But it was still great entertainment. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the story progression from movie to movie, and then going to the theater to see the current version. It really tied a lot of things togethert and you get all the double entendres! If for no other reason, see these movies to really apprecialte how far the movie industry has come with special effects.<br />I wouldn't have gone out of my way to buy this if it wasn't for the fact that it was a gold-box deal (and my wife is a trekkie - go figure). It's a hard sell at the regular price, so wait for a deal.<br />And, by the way, how many times can one space ship be totally decimated and still come back???
B00847KFDS|5.0|The DJ on 107 Austin was playing a great old song, come to find out John Fogerty had a new record/CD out.<br />If you like Rock and Roll and you think it is a country CD well you are not all wrong but it is GREAT, give it a listen.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Cool app.  I use it daily for information on local wx anf to keep tabs on places of interest.<br /><br />The forecast is pretty accurate and allows me to plan outings
B00785P2QC|5.0|Lot's of fun. I would recommend. Keeps on working when you are away from it. I really enjoy G5 games.<br />levels up at a reasonable rate.<br />easy to learn how to build and upgrade.<br />These types of games are very addictive.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like the game okay - sometimes it's too challenging and I grow bored with it.  I will keep playing and give it more time to grab me.
B0035HKWM6|5.0|I would recommend it to anybody who just wants to relax at the end of the day and have a good laugh. I've watched this movie about 10 times and I'll watch it again.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|It totally converts 400 to 800. How about that? Pretty tough to beat widgets that do exactly what they describe!
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|I have always wanted to be a doctor and this might help me in the future my neice loves this app
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Love the Astoria connection (they have a Goonies tour available on line) and the personalities of the kids. It is corny fun.
0394800184|5.0|My daughter loves this book & I had a baby shower to go to where they asked that you bring a book with a message written in it instead of a card. On Amazon you can always find books so cheap. Most of the time the shipping costs more than the book.
B00A0R02HO|2.0|I don't know why they even titled this Total Recall. Seriously, apart from using the same names and a few homages, this is NOT Total Recall. No Mars, a ridiculous &#34;tunnel through the earth&#34;, and very little imagination, mar this movie. As far as the &#34;Unrated&#34; aspect, another review points out each addition, but the part I noticed is allot of F-U's. That's it. It seemed inappropriate and I was even wondering why they cursed all the time.<br />I also re-watched the original. For God's sake, if you haven't wasted time or money on this movie, just watch the original. It has more imagination in the first 30 minutes than this film has in 2 hours. It seriously lacks the charisma and star factor of the original. Not recommended except for the die hards.
B005GSY23M|5.0|Like many of the director's movies, music plays a crucial role in Drive. Soundtrack includes a handful of the prerecorded songs that were so interesting to hear plus most of the original, instrumental songs that gave the film such an interesting mood. One of the albums I like to play while writing.
B00479SVBU|1.0|It has to be put every time in lighter. If it is not done and I switch it off, turn off car, switch it again it is loading USB forever. Sometimes it freezes, sometimes it starts to play but from  the beginning. It does not remember song position when I turn it off. So, I will try to return it. Just waste the time. Money for nothing.
B000001FFS|5.0|you cant go wrong with Anthrax.this is probably the best one I think.I seen this band live 2 times my favorite is madhouse and AIR
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever it really helps you learn how to take care of a horse and play with it it is really fun
B00CE0BJQ8|5.0|I fell hard for this album. As other reviewers have said, there is something sneaky about the way it suddenly dawns on you how absolutely brilliant the music is. This music will haunt you. It will make you laugh and bring tears to your eyes. I have pushed this on my friends like a drug. You owe it to yourself to give it a chance- you will no doubt find something in it that calls to you. Have it playing in the background while you go about your day and at some point you will have your own revelation. A simply amazing album.
B00008S7KC|1.0|This DVD will not play on our DVD player at all. I forgot to write a review or contact the seller when I purchased it so sorry my review is late.<br />It does play on my Mac but it totally sucks that I can't watch it on my big screen tv.
0345501292|5.0|Contains just about every story and photo you can imagine is out there on the subject of the Indian Jones franchise. For a filmmaker, this book is even more exciting. Even the chapter on &#34;The Crystal Skull&#34; makes you almost forget that the movie was disappointing compared to the others.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love using this app it comes quite in handy since my battery on my kindle isn't accurate this app lets me know what the true percentage is.
0061537969|5.0|The nearest thing to actually being a dog. Imaginative. One life force, manifesting itself simultaneously as dog, man, everything. Can't wait for the movie.

1452126577|5.0|This book is one word: awesome. It is full of illustrations and games you can play. It is a nice hard-cover so it will stand up to years of grumpiness. Don't miss out on this one!
0385349947|4.0|The case studies contained within were great. I really liked that she talked about personal experiences proving that it is possible to have both!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Enjoyed the game just wish it was longer. The dark storyline is intriguing. Cheaper to purchase here than through Big Fish by a couple of dollars. My advice is to get the hour long trial from Big Fish then buy the game here.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game it is a six dollar well spent, but i wish they could add mob spawners and they could add an enchantment table that would be awesome and have you craft the things not them being there manually but still an awesome game
1936719010|5.0|I enjoyed Mr. Pressfield's insights.  Looking at the world through his point of view and hearing his story was quite enlightening.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|owned the triple vinyl back in day as teen saw him our bicentennial year in philly..great show..just 5 yrs removed from beattles era..young McCartney making great music live..awesome bass player enthusiastic  no matter what he plays great lyricist  the late great jimmy mccoullock sweet on lead guitar denny lane great linda  cut her slack God bless her..shes in tune and contributes joe English whole soul into drums..sweet sweet sounds of 4 horn section..nothing not to like..buy it..
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Well this is better than no/4 as to relating to the over done bits that spoils a lot of shows, The story is great and the actors done a great job performing their roles. Okay the story goes to Russia where dad goes looking for his son and puts his big foot in it, That happens a lot with him doesn't it. Now to carry with our story his son is investigating a crime incorporation and trying to catch them but with dad there, he has just got to go. The suspense is there and so is the action plenty more to be said but why spoil it for you. So get a move on and grab the munchies pick up the movie on the way and have a look for yourself, you won't be disappointed. I rated this an A grade plus for the thrills and spills, edge of the seat action. Thrown in to confuse the matter are a few pieces to keep you guessing, Something for you to find out, Fantastic entertainment at its best so grab your chair and put your feet up to relax to a wonderful night with this fabulous movie.  Enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is challenging. it keeps you interested and you want to go further! make more rooms! please?! my husband and I love this game
B000002KGT|5.0|This album was well edited and I grew up listening to it as a child on LP and it was energizing enough to sing along too then and still fun now.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book!  I purchased this book on a recommendation from a co-worker to take on my vacation.  It was so good, needless to say, I didn't get much done.  However, anything about the 'old South&#34; is always good...
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I'm really not Jame's target market.<br /><br />I only stumbled across his blog about a week ago, and I was already in agreement with many of his (what most would call &#34;unorthodox&#34;) views before reading anything that he's written.<br /><br />College is a scam. Government is run by crooks. Buying a house is a bad investment - and that today more than ever you can't rely on ANYONE but yourself to create the life that you want to live.<br /><br />Some of the stuff I posted above are more from his blog than this book specifically. What this book did for me personally was to open my eyes to think BIGGER. Want to start an airline? Want to be a rockstar or a best-selling author all by yourself? You can.<br /><br />You just have to be open to accepting that reality - whatever it is that you love, or want to do in life, it's possible.<br /><br />I'm personally not a fan of &#34;self-help&#34; books. This isn't a &#34;feel good&#34; book. It's about realizing what's possible, stripping away emotional baggage, washing away constraints that you've been indoctrinated to believe since birth, finding your own special way to bring value to the world and so much more...<br /><br />...We live in a &#34;Choose Yourself&#34; economy. If you don't choose yourself, you're on the way out. The middle class is dying and this will soon be the only option left for the average person to live a life worth living.<br /><br />I really dig Jame's writing style, it's incredibly thought provoking and hilariously self-depreciating at the same time. Topics range from &#34;why hasn't technology made pooping obsolete?&#34; to &#34;how to inject your brain with feel good chemicals through social media&#34;.<br /><br />But the core story, the real-world examples and the ideas presented will make you think, open your eyes to opportunities that you've never considered before and realize that even though you're human - deeply flawed, warts and all - you're free to take control of your destiny at anytime.<br /><br />I personally love this book because I can identify with so many of the ideas that James covers. But no matter where you are in life right now, I guarantee that this book will make you laugh, make you think, and force you to re-imagine what's possible in life.<br /><br />I've never given a book 5-stars, 4 is as high as my rating system goes because I've yet to find a &#34;perfect&#34; book. James is far from perfect, just like you and me. But I highly recommend this book to anyone, whether you're stuck flipping burgers or you're a fortune 500 CEO. It will change the way you think.<br /><br />If you're on the fence Google his name and read his blog. You'll know pretty quick if he's a guy you want to learn from, that's what sold me on it.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's a refreshing, fun and thought provoking read that will force you to examine your life and most likely change it for the better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The show is very well written and what a great cast. I can't wait for Season 4. I recommend this series.
1401938906|5.0|I love, love, love, this book. So glad I ordered it. E-Squared was delivered as advertised. I have done the first 3 experiments and they have worked for me.
B006WXHJOO|5.0|I love this film.  It is a laugh a minute. A great one for all the family to enjoy together.
B002DKF54Q|5.0|recommend this album for the collector of Eno / Fripp music  This was always the first album I heard from the duo in the mid 1980's from an overlook of Santa Barbara, CA airport at night made this one extra memorable.  Had to own it.  Would be kinda odd or boring if someone did not understand the group or was not open minded to try something new.
1885167776|5.0|\\"The ONE Thing\\" is a game changer for my personal and work world. The ideas and research that Gary and Jay share prove that we should be focused on only one thing, the most important thing, at a time. It's impacting my productivity at work and improving my relationships at home. We use Gary and Jay's \\"focusing question\\" in just about everything we do. We are healthier, more productive and happier. \\"The Focusing Question\\" is the lens we look through when making decisions. Read this book, then read it again, then read it again and then pass it on!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the games are fun and some are a bot buggy.  But all in all not bad.  You can't complain to much on a free game
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Volbeat have made another great album. From top to bottom every song is great and they are very heavy. I have been a fan of volbeat ever since I saw them open for Metallica. Great band.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|this game wastes almost all my space on my tablet you shouldn't get it.....,........so DONT GET IT UNLESS THIS IS THE only game you are going to get
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys not only make great music, they produce the videos in wonderful vistas. Way to go Piano Guys!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|really weird. lost focus like 3 times, i  kept rewinding. finally i just turned it off. dont wast your time or money. great actors but weird storyline
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Another excellent album by One Republic. They continue to produce great albums and I will continue to be a fan for a long time.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie is great! I've seen Les Miserables on Broadway twice and multiple time with Broadway touring companies. This movie captures the energy of the stage. It puts a different light on some of the characters portraying them with more gentleness and more confliction at times. I truly enjoyed the movie and am glad that I own it so that I can watch it again and again.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|A triumphant homage to both the kaiju eiga classics of the 60's & 70's, and modern super robot anime, Pacific Rim is every little boy's childhood made new again. Director Guillermo del Toro succeeds where the likes of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich have failed in finally creating a genuinely fun, thrilling, and sometimes scarey big budget Hollywood kaiju/giant robot film that fans can be proud of, but can also be enjoyed by people of all ages and interests without having had to debase itself to the lowest common denominator. You won't find any silly fart jokes here. The female characters are competent heroic characters, not air-headed barely clothed trollops. And rather than delivering a cynical downer message, the story is quite uplifting and champions the virtues of unity and teamwork. That the jaeger vs kaiju battles are completely mind blowing is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />Help cancel the apocalypse, watch Pacific Rim.
B000ZP6MIY|5.0|These crocs were as expected! They are definitely true to size so when you are ordering select your same exact size. I work at Chipotle  8 hours a day 6 days a week and these crocs have saved my feet from getting exhausted. I couldn't have asked for a better pair of work shoes. They are non-slip, and fit snug which keeps your feet in the same place and avoids any injuries. If you are always on your feet and are looking for something comfortable for your feet, I recommend these crocs!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very well done and amazing graphics and very interactive. Very much like you would be in a carnival atmosphere. Fan of macabre and gives you that feeling. Also hints help throughout the game.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great free fun game for all ages.  Good graphics, challenging game play and a good break from Temple Run and Subway Surfer.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|I love the facts that it had all these action movies heroes and the fact that they were all very good in their own right.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|great characters, well written, brilliantly cast, humor excellent. I enjoy intelligent dialog with real wit. I'm looking for the books.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a good alarm and works well...I will use this instead of a wake up call while traveling about.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|this game is fun because it is a nice piano app to play I think u guys shoud get it
B00B4804KS|5.0|This is the best retrofitted 3D I've seen.  The sense of depth rivals Avatar and Hugo.  As a bonus, the sound is much improved over the original blu-ray release.
0385474547|4.0|Mr. Achebe is a giant of world literature, in this case presenting a universal theme in his native African setting.  The hero is a great man in his community, even though he is born to a father who is an impractical musician and is viewed in the community as being weak.  Enter the 'tragic flaw' familiar to students of Greek literature from the classical period.  The son feels driven to be everything the father wasn't (and none of what he was.)  As in the Greek tradition, no good ever comes from extremism applied over the long run.  We learn of our protagonist's early successes and they are presented in what I, an outsider, believe to be an authentic African cultural context.  Like audiences at the performance/recitation of a Greek tragedy, we read on in horror and with sympathy as a human being is broken by an inexorable chain of events.  Through the words of an African writer we explore issues such as what is means to be a son, to be a husband, to be a father...to be a member of a community...and to be a member of a wider 'humanity.'<br /><br />The story is told 'cleanly' and simply, in a way like the stories of John Steinbeck or of Hemmingway.  The 'Truth' of the author's intent stands out.  This book is fine literature!
B005544TRQ|5.0|It's a great TV show! I am hooked and love how witty the two main characters interact with one another. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|You will end up saying I know all this stuff already, or it obvious. But it's useful just to have a reminder to do this or do that. It serves as some motivation to go out and talk to people also.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|kids 10 &amp; 8 yrs love this app' had to put it on our nook and the nabi so they can play at the same time'
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I love this game, and it only crashes if you're button mashing in battle. It's easy to have fun with.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I hesitated to buy this movie because I kept seeing unfavorable comparisons to the other Bourne movies, but finally gave in.  I'm glad I did.  The first time I watched it, I had my doubts for the fist part of the movie, but when subsequent events started to tie things together, it all made sense.  Since Bourne movies all have car chases, I'd be remiss for not mentioning that this movie has an excellent one.<br /><br />It is a good addition to the Bourne collection.
B00608HMFW|5.0|This show is so well done, both in acting, scripts and production.  I started watching during the 5th season and decided to purchase all seasons available (6). I recently purchased Season 7 and am considering a T-shirt.  The relationship between the boys and other family members is realistic and impressionable.  Each episode is intense. I'm in my late 40's and a huge fan - so there's no 'idol crush' going on.  Just an appreciation for a superbly produced, directed and acted show with great story lines, special effects and actors.  Can't wait for Season 8 to become available and counting the days till Season 9 begins!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I think they were going for a certain modern pop-culture look (the kind that appeals to illiterate teenagers) when they redesigned the UI.  I want a weather app that has my settings and options all right there, up front.  I'm looking for something that requires the least amount of key strokes possible for everything; I'm not looking for pretty pictures.  I just want the weather.  As if that wasn't bad enough, the data provided is frequently inaccurate.  For current conditions, it gives bad data that I can tell is bad just by opening a window or walking out to my porch to look at the thermometer.  Don't even get me started about the accuracy of forecasts!  It seems as if their app has gone the way of their channel.  What's next, links to a reality TV show?
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|After reading all of his other books, I wondered how it would end, would it be a let down? The final book was everything I had hoped for. I am just sorry it's over!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Story line is written great. Characters performance, well you have to see..... Wonderful, suggest for any family....  Animation is off the chain.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Great movie as a standalone; actually got me to watch the series, which outshines the movie by far. As most Firefly fans, I find the movie lacking in comparison to the series, and very lacking without first seeing the series; that said, I enjoyed it immensely. Only bought the DVDs for the extras/deleted scenes after watching on Netflix.
B003G4W49C|3.0|While the plot was decent, the characters seemed to be stereotypes, rather than real people. Maybe I've forgotten what it is like to be a kid, but this just wasn't my cup of tea.  I guess I won't be reading the rest of the series or seeing the movie when it comes out.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones deliver amazing sound and clarity.  The are perfect for the home and studio use.  For the price you cant beat them.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Bought this for my son's Kindle Fire. Perfect cover...protects the kindle and it's sturdy. No frills but it serves its purpose.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I loved it on DS, and now I love it even more! So much fun to play! Everyone with fingers should play it!
B00BQYK1IK|4.0|Do you long for more of God's presence?  Do you ache to see Him at work in your life?  Do you desire His peace and rest?  Renowned worship leader Darlene Zschech invites you to gather with her around the Word of God.  Born out of her own yearnings that she poured onto the pages of journals, these meditations and Scriptures reveal Jesus and speak of His finished work - how He tenderly cares for you and wants you to know Him.<br /><br />Darlene Zschech is co-pastor with her husband, Mark, of Hope Unlimited Church in New South Wales, Australia.  Acclaimed worldwide as a singer, songwriter, worship leader, author, and speaker, she will always be best known for her song \\"Shout to the Lord.\\" which continues to encourage people in their worship of God around the globe.<br /><br />I am always on the lookout for a good devotional boo.  I think that when I am studying the Bible it helps to have something to facilitate that study.  There is always some additional insight that I wouldn't have thought of in the questions or thoughts that are written on the pages; it is always a help to me.<br /><br />Revealing Jesus: A 365-Day Devotional by Darlene Zschech is a great resource for Bible study.  It is an entire year focused on getting to know Jesus.  Each day there is a verse or passage followed by some amazing, and personal, thoughts from the author.  Each day ends with a short thought or prayer to meditate on throughout the day.<br /><br />I really like that the verses are written right in the book, not just a reference.  Sometimes I think the barrier that holds people back from doing a devotion every day is finding the Bible and looking up the passage.  I know that sometimes it is easier to have it all right in front of me.  I also appreciated the different translations used for the scripture.  I am always able to go back to the Bible I use to delve deeper into scripture, but sometimes it is nice to read from a paraphrase like the Message or to see what a different Bible translation says.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful way to learn more about Jesus.  Having Jesus be the focus of an entire year is a great way to focus your relationship with Him.  What better way to get to know Him better, than to spend the entire year studying about Him.  Anything that can draw you nearer to Jesus is an excellent resource to have!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book has everything on it, struts your peers at times or not? The games are unforgiving.  It been a great book.
B00CL8D83U|1.0|I am in total disbelief of this 9 track piece of garbage I heard today. I was so excited to receive my copy. Ordered it as soon as it became available. I received it today and I want to throw it off my balcony! I am a massive Pet Head and have loved these guys since the mid 80's. But this latest release is a total train wreck! There are only 2 tracks that I could tolerate. First one is \\"Fluorescent\\", the last one is \\"Thursday\\". But \\"Thursday\\" was RUINED by the rappin' crap that popped in there midway through the song... It was like shooting an arrow through my heart. It just killed the song. My God,they have put out some absolutely awesome songs in the past. \\"Very\\" and \\"Behaviour\\" were perfect in so many ways.. then they release this garbage. I tried really hard to like it. I played it 2 times to give it a second chance. It failed big time!<br /><br />I would be ashamed to introduce the Pet Shop Boys music to anyone with this embarrassing release. It is like a total nightmare. Sorry, to sound so dark and gloomy, but this is just awful:((
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Let me start off by saying that the original line-up feat. the late, great Layne Staley was my favorite. And I'll admit that I was skeptical of this album but I took a chance and made the purchase and now I'm glad that I did. The tracks on this album from start to finish are all very solid and I've listened to it in it's entirety several times now and I keep enjoying it more and more. If you're an AIC fan, I suggest you give it a chance!
0062059963|3.0|I really enjoyed The Selection, although I didn't really like the love triangle. There are very few love triangles that actually work for me. I understand why America is pulled in two different directions and her feelings towards her old love and possibly a new one, but I still felt like she wasn't being true to anyone with her actions and was a little hypocritical. She hates that Maxon might kiss the other girls, yet she does the same. This was much of the focal point of The Elite carried over from the first book.<br /><br />We see more of the dysopian aspects in this book than we did in the first one. There are a couple of groups that have increased their attacks. There are also other groups that support one girl over another, for political or personal reasons. We learn more about the history of the country and the type of king Maxon's father is and the type of leader Maxon will be. There is one part where America finds a confidential note, but then nothing actually comes of it. It seems a long stretch to wait for the next book to find what role that note plays, so I'm not sure why it was included. I liked the dystopian aspects and am really curious to see how things play out in the end and who will be involved.<br /><br />I liked America's character, except for the whole love triangle thing and her indecisiveness and not thinking things through. She really is the best candidate for future queen out of Maxon's choices. I still can't stand Celeste! I also liked Maxon less and more. He does some things that, if I was America, I would have serious issues with. He also does some really good things. They are all in kind of a complicated situation. The things I had issues with regarding the characters made this book a little bit disappointing though. I didn't love any of the characters and their choices and none of them have really redeemed themselves, to me at least.<br /><br />I will finish out the series when the next book comes out next year. I am hoping that it will redeem it for me. I'll just have to wait and see. If you enjoy watching those type of Bachelor/Bachelorette reality shows and enjoyed The Selection, then I would definitely recommend reading The Elite.<br /><br />Content: Some mild violence and making out.<br />Source: Libraryl redeem it for me.

B000F8O35U|5.0|My children LOVE this movie and I remember loving it when i was younger too. I dislike the skimpy clothing on the main character and the idea that she can just fall in love based on looks. So if your a person who likes your kids to learn a lesson from movies then don't pick this one LOL (but its got cute characters so I hope you enjoy it, my kids love it!!)
B0058N2T3K|5.0|Thanks a lot for this great collection of the Elm Street movies, I really enjoy them from the 80's and fortunately I get the collection so see and keep them forever.
B009AMANH4|5.0|was great only i could not get movie in full screen  it was very hard to view when u have black on top and bottom
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Amazing show!  It can be a bit too graphic for my taste at times, but it is expertly written and the acting is above anything else on network tv.  The main story arc is great and the interaction between Hannibal and Will is complex and satisfying.  I was hesitant to watch this show because I figured it would just be a cash-in, but I am happy to be wrong.  The characters behave much like I imagined while reading the books.  It is the most faithful portrayal of Lecter to date, and Mikkelsen shows just how over the top Hopkins version was, to the point where he was more akin to a monster like Dracula or Frankenstein.  Mikkelsen's Lecter is much more disturbing because you can picture a chameleon like this existing in reality.  My only criticism is the killer a week set-up...it can pull me out of the world at times because it is so formula TV.  If they would drop the new killer every week framework and instead focus on a killer per season it would make the show just about perfect.  I can not wait for Dolarhyde to make his first appearance.
B00CQTKGY8|4.0|The book has great hints, like use a tether with my helmet to prevent from losing my GoPro. Other hints like how to configure my Hero3 were welcome.
B009J2VQSK|5.0|Because it was very, very good. Entertaining,dazzling,superb,fantastico,excellent, in other words, because I have to type so many,,,, I just reall, really, really liked it and if you get it I think you'll like it too, and if not get a refund, which cheerfully given even though you can't see the hidden smile,,,behind the frown...
B005KAH7QU|2.0|While there are some captivating action sequences (interrogation room), and overall a pretty cool plot, ultimately the movie fails to deliver. The numerous gaping plot holes, the director's overriding desire to evoke the air of a horror-flick, and dingy, bleak cinematography kill it as a fun-to-watch flick.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Don't see this movie if you are looking for a snappy action/assassin/adventure movie. It's just too weird and unbelievable in a non-cool way.<br /><br />See this movie if you are into fantasy action flicks that touch on the sentimental, or want a subtle action movie with a touch of creepy/horror, or especially if you are fond of Grimm's Fairy Tales (which I confess to have never read).
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Loved the movie and I love Maggie smith. I like movies that have a story you can follow. It was delightful
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Reminded me of playing Myst with my brother when I was a kid.  So much better than the usual mindless games. Wish it would have been longer!!
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|I use this to stream Netflix and TV shows from my laptop to my TV. Works perfectly, and it's nice to be able to watch shows from network websites on the big screen in HD quality, rather than having to view them on the small laptop.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I truly love the trilogy.  I love that this book literally picks up in the same time frame that book one ends and not a giant leap of time.  It is one of the things that hooked me to this book from the get go!
B00AF82WTO|2.0|I'm sorry, but this was very bad. Terribly rushed, not great acting, and it's like the screen writer never read the book. It's way too short so they had to cut out huge chunks of the story, plus a lot of places where they did have scenes that  were from the book they took them and changed them up so much they were almost unrecognizable!! What the heck is up with all the running at the end? Ann chases Wentworth all over Bath, running full speed for what seemed like hours. And oh, that kiss when she catches him!! That horrible, awkward kiss.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Fabulous series brilliantly written, some great characters. Only problem is I want to sit and watch it all but have to take breaks for work and sleep
B008XNZMOU|2.0|I was kind of disappointed in this album and am regretting the money I spent on it. Her music is growing more and more pop. This album has a couple of good tracks that sound simliar to her 3 previous albums. Her lyrics are more explicit and more depressing. I really hope this was just a \\"experimental\\" album and that Taylor will return to her country music.
1568363931|4.0|This book has provided me with a lot of simple, fresh recipes that I wouldn't have otherwise discovered. The only thing I don't like about it is the recipes only serve one, but with a little math that can be remedied.
B000H7JCIW|5.0|I just think she is fantastic and this concert was so wonderful. I can and have watched it many many times. The sound and visual quality isn't the greatest. It has been transferred from an old VHS to DVD I believe. But it's still great.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read the trilogy a LOT of times, and this is always my favorite in the series.  They both come so far in this book and it all comes together.  It has suspense, comedy, lots of emotion, and of course lots of sex :) It is fantastic!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app for everyone. This is a good visual aid and also functions s night light that isn't too bright.I recommend this app.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|Not a bad movie for just no sense watching.  Tells the story about Thor to some degree and help explain some history when watching the Avengers.  If you have nothing to do and need some kid like entertainment, not bad.
B00846REIS|5.0|Upon first reading this book I felt it reflected the same story of 50 Shades of Grey. The more I got into the story I saw that it was a lot different and it really captivated me. It is one of my favorite series. I cannot wait for book number 4.
B0093LFENA|5.0|I don't get how hard to get this cd was in L.A.! But al last it was worth it! Great music!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great game! Fun challenges and story line... Will play through multiple times... gruul raiding party was such a fun challenge..
B003VWU2WA|5.0|Easy to program, will be a real assest to my photobooth business. thanks for a great piece of technolgy that is good to look at as well as fuctional.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun and really great!! it's a fun game and I just love it because it is so fun game and minions are so fun to play with!!
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Wanted action, action, action and was willing to ignore what was obviously going to be a silly plot BUT in the end, plot was SO silly, NO, Stupid, I could not ignore. Anything good I can say? Nope. Acting, pacing, effects...all second rate, This not even a good b-rated syfy. Ignore this turkey, please.
B003YUBXVI|5.0|This book is just awesome , I Love the way it's written and the brilliant use of real world places , things and orginisations . I recommend this book for everyone 12 years and up
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My seven year old can't get enough of this game. Beware of in app purchases of gems though. A must have for horse lovers
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I could play it for hours.  It does get progressively more complicated, and much fun.  I would highly recommend it. Nice way to challenge yourself as it gets more complicated.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I can't count how many times I laughed out loud when I first watched this film; the sheer meanness and selfishness of Gru was unreal. POW!! goes the balloon animal he'd made for the little boy after he'd put the needle to it. Classic! I could go on and on as to all the things that happened, but you've just got to either buy it, or rent it first, then you WILL buy it, 'cuz it'll steal your heart away. Actually, the girls will. Agnes was my favorite, but all three are so lovable you'll not soon forget any of 'em. The minions? My stomach hurt from the constant guffaws at their antics; how they can be so smart, yet so stoopid is amazing. You will bust a gut just from watching them pass another car on the road on the way to the store to - dare I throw out this spoiler? - find Agnes a replacement Unicorn. The results back at the house were heartwarming.  I've asked quite a number of people if they've seen this movie, and eight of ten, surprisingly to me, have not. I've heartily recommended it, and do also to anyone who reads this.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Pretty Funny take off of the Original Series. Goes back and forth from Comedy to Drama! A good Johnny Depp film
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|This really is not a bad film at all. Decent plot, pacing, action, effects. Even Cruise was ok and no Cruise fan. Saw it on theater screen and not sure how it going to translate to a TV screen. BUT give this a try. Good enough and sometimes that is enough.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game app is amazing i love playing this everyday and i hope that others will enjoy it too God bless everyone wish u the best on this awesome game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best app took me a little while to figure out out but now that I did it is hard to put it down
B007J4T2G8|1.0|At first I thought this book would be sexy and thrilling but instead it had the exact same sexual encounters every other page, there was limited vocabulary in this book and it took forever to get anywhere.  Even the sexual content was boring.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This book will change your perspective on life and give you the tools necessary to live a long, abundant, and joyful life.  A worthy read indeed!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This was just as good watching it the Second time as it was the first time when it was on FX
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I admit that I am one of those people who reads a book then sees the movie and am disappointed.  This movie is no exception.  What could have been a series of very good movies was condensed into one movie that cannot possibly move forward into the sequels.  How can it when so much was changed in the first movie that there is no way to incorporate the other books?<br /><br />That being said, if you have not read the series you will probably enjoy this movie. On it's own, it really wasn't bad.  The acting was decent, although a bit cheesy in parts.  It moved along well and had a decent story line.  So, if you're just looking for a movie whose trailer looks interesting, I definitely wouldn't tell you to pass on this one.  If you're looking for a movie that reflects even 1/3 of the actual book series, choose another one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game had somewhat of a challenge but there wasn't enough levels. I would recommend this game for the younger ones.
0425263924|5.0|The third book in the series was as good as the first two. the depth of feelings had me totally  entwined and i cannot wait till book 4
B008XG1X18|5.0|I actually spend too much time pinning.  Every time I have a second I go to Pinterest.  There is so much info out there.  I have learned a lot of useful things.
B003YUF0GC|5.0|it is ashame that you have to buy another receiver for the CoPolit progam when you already paid 150 for the program and u already have a receiver for the computer but it is ok I guess just more money to put out

B00969GFFU|2.0|Franzen's novel reads like an over-complicated answer to a simple question. There is so much detail packed into the lives of an American family, the Berglunds, that the reader gets an overload of information surrounding them; we're talking back-story and back back-story, in a narrative that spans the second half of the twentieth century into the first decade of the new millennium. Not content with just focusing on the four family members, Franzen gives an expose of each of their family members and their respective relationships, as well as patriarch Walter Berglund's parents and brothers, and then exhaustively, Walter's wife's Patty, her own parents and her neurotic siblings, all fighting for their stories to be heard in the 600 or so pages of the novel.<br /><br />No doubt, despite the overwhelming cast of characters, Franzen takes pain to give voice to his four main characters; Patty, a one-time school athlete, Walter, the lawyer turned environmentalist, his BFF sometime rocker/slacker Richard, and the Berglund's son, Joey, devoting sections to each one. The narrative is not chronological, and you get the different perspectives of the same events from the characters, sometimes rather laboriously.<br /><br />The saving grace to this novel is Franzen's fluid prose, which is easy to read and keeps the reader turning the pages, because frankly, by the last third of the novel, it got really tedious, and I found myself rushing through it just to get to the end. This novel would have benefitted from some copious editing and trimming, in my opinion, especially when it dealt repetitively with issues on depression, and individual freedom. Make the point and move on already; don't belabour it.<br /><br />An interesting device Franzen employs is to have Patty (at the advice of her therapist) write an autobiography in the voice of a third person for one of the earlier sections of the novel. This potentially gives the reader a layered narrative that helps one understand the middle-aged Patty better as she reviews her adolescent and young adult years, to show how she is moulded into the person she becomes, and also challenges the reader to query the reliability of her narrative, which could reveal more about her in the bits she chooses to highlight and in others that she tends to ignore or gloss over.<br /><br />However, the autobiographer Patty isn't distinctive enough to sound very different from the author's own voice, and this device doesn't quite meet up to its potential. Patty is a complex character, but ever so self-indulgent and manipulative, e.g. she favours her son Joey and has an almost irreverent relationship with him, setting him up against her husband Walter and initiating cruel conversations about him in a bid to be Joey's friend. So Patty is hurt when Joey turns on her and moves out of the house to move in with their neighbour Carol and her deadbeat daughter Connie, the latter with whom Joey has been having an illicit relationship with. Is it any wonder that Joey turns out to be a user, like his mom?<br /><br />Political and environmental issues suddenly come to the forefront when the narrative on Walter takes over. There is this frankly implausible portion when Walter prattles on incessantly to Richard about saving the Cerulean Warbler and pontificates on the problem of overpopulation, when he has not been given voice in at least a third of the novel or been known to have any passion for the environment. Even Franzen weaves this little discrepancy in: \\"He was aware, of course, that it was wrong to feel this way - if only because, for almost twenty years, in St. Paul, he hadn't\\". Right. And on top of his latter-day aspirations, the suddenly mousy, bespectacled Walter has an adoring 27-year-old secretary, Lalitha, hanging on to his every word, practically pushing her bosom into his pasty face, when he's had no luck with women all his life. The fact that she is Indian seems to be a weak attempt to exoticise the relationship,rather than a story device.<br /><br />Less there be said that the novel is lacking in overall themes and concerns, it does deal with the issue of competition quite consistently throughout. Take for instance the interesting conundrum Patty and Walter have in their enmeshed relationship with Walter's college roomie Richard, a sometime trash-metal then alt-country rocker that ultimately splits them apart. There is also quite a refreshing take on intense same-sex friendships that aren't homosexual, but go quite beyond your usual bromance or sisterhood. Walter and Richard is a prime example of that, serving as a foil to Patty's relationship with her manic-depressive stalker-turned-friend Eliza in her youth.<br /><br />The novel also addresses the perennial problem of parenthood and challenges some pre-conceived notions of parent-child relationships: \\"Parents are programmed to want the best for their kids, regardless of what they get in return. That's what love is supposed to be like, right? But in fact, if you think about it, that's kind of a strange belief\\".<br /><br />On the whole, while Freedom is no doubt an ambitious and imaginative novel about the way we live and love, it would have benefitted from a \\"less is more\\" approach to deliver what it wants to say more concisely and precisely.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|I'm 68% through the book and I just saw the movie.  I have to say the book is much better because you get many individual view points which makes it very intriguing.  I don't usually spend more than 3 or 4 dollars on a book but the $10 was worth it.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I first heard Joe a couple of years ago and liked his music then but when I saw him at the Vienna Opera House on PBS I fell head over heels for this man!  His talent is, to say the least, marvelous, and we are blessed to have him amongst us!
B001BKTEZA|4.0|I really loved this book.  The economic struggles of the Joad family mirror what is happening to thousands of families today in response to globalization.  Entire communities facing economic ruin when a major employer suddenly closes down and ships all of the jobs overseas, or cuts jobs and replaces workers with machines, leaving thousands of workers with little or no other options but to pull up stakes, leave everything behind and look for better opportunities elsewhere, only to find the cards stacked against them by the very system that created the problem in the first place.  Families facing unrelenting competition for fewer and fewer job opportunities while employers squeeze more and more concessions from desperate people who are looking for any scrap of work they can find to survive.<br /><br />I found it compelling that the Joad's, whose only motivation was to look for any work to support themselves, were considered undesirables and scorned and exploited by the rich and powerful.  The parallels to what is happening today in our society was striking.  Would the Joad's have been considered 'takers' because they stayed in a government work camp to survive when they couldn't find any work to support themselves?<br /><br />I'm glad to hear that Steven Spielberg recently purchased the rights to this story and plans to re-make the movie.  I hope he does for this story what he did for Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List and shift America's perspective on the plights of the poor and disadvantaged.  I plan to view the 1940 version of this story starting Henry Fonda.<br /><br />I'm so glad that I finally was able to read this very compelling novel. You will really enjoy it if you have never read it before.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|AWSOME! when I got a tablit I was looking for game's I saw the minion Rush and I installed it and played it and I loved it!
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Instrumentally great! Robert Glasper has this way of making his drum tracks off beat in some spots that make you pay attention. The collabos are wonderful and appropriate. My favorites are Afro Blue, Cherish the Day, and Ahh Yeah.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Cant beat the price ..The entire movie is so great in every way and with a very light-fun- filled cast makes the movie go by quick.
B008OOYALE|2.0|The concept of this game is cute but unless you have gold bricks then you need to have an infinite amount of patience.  The graphics are great and the dragons are cute.  The problems I have with this game is that once you finally hatch an egg and you feed it to a level 3, you can't advance to level 4 without your dragon having to go through an evolve process which takes the same amount of time as it did when it was breeding and incubating.  And then it has to evolve again to get to level 7.  Also if you want to expand your park, you can't unless you have friends that have to send you a map or something to that effect.  This game is cute but difficult to advance in due to all the extra things you are required to do.  My kids quickly got bored with all the waiting and have more fun on Dragonvale.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game almost like the computer version slender man looks very cool up close all that I don't like about this game is it doesn't have that many maps. To me this game is not scary but my bro peed his pants. But any way this is an epic game get it

B00006I53S|2.0|When I got this lens, the first thing that I noticed was its poor build quality.  When I spend several hundred bucks for a lens, I expect that the mechanical bits will behave like they were built to strict tolerances.  When a lens clearly does not meet those high standards, I return it.  I returned two copies of this lens.  At this point, I've given up and concluded that Canon's quality control, at least for this particular lens, has absolutely gone into the toilet.<br /><br />The main build quality problem is the way the zoom mechanism operates.  When you turn the zoom ring on a well-built zoom lens, it moves fairly easily without sticking, but it exhibits some drag throughout the range, and absolutely does not move on its own.  With this lens, by contrast, if you tilt the lens vertically, it slams its way to nearly the maximum zoom setting--not quite all the way, because the last part of the zoom range is much tighter than the first part, but most of the way.  So the zoom action has way too little drag in most of its range, and vastly inconsistent drag.  I saw this problem on both copies of the lens, and the problem was even worse with a filter attached.<br /><br />To make this more alarming, this severe lens creep problem isn't a consistent problem with these lenses.  I've read multiple folks on the Internet who say that they returned these lenses to Canon for repairs (for unrelated problems) and got back tight lenses that worked as they should.  This suggests that Canon has wildly inconsistent quality control on these lenses, and that they just don't care enough to fix the problem.  That's deeply disturbing.<br /><br />The problem with lens creep is not just that the lens can change focal length on you without you intending to do so; it also means that the lens takes a lot of abuse during normal use.  When you take it off the camera and put it in a bag, for example, it slams its way to the telephoto end of its range every time.  When you tilt your camera down, it moves.  Every time it moves in an uncontrolled way, it is likely putting stress on various parts inside the lens, and that is almost guaranteed to reduce the life expectancy of the lens compared with a lens that moves less frequently.<br /><br />I've used Canon lenses for many years, including a wide range of EF and EF-s lenses.  I've never seen anything remotely approaching this level of lens slop in any of them.  It is simply unacceptably poor build quality.  From what I've seen, I would strongly urge anyone considering these lenses to go with the 24-105 instead.  It is a much, much better lens.  I'm not talking about a small difference here.  The 28-135 just plain feels like a toy by comparison.<br /><br />I terribly miss the extra reach that I used to get with my 17-85 on a crop body, but it's not worth dealing with a lens that is this sloppy.  I guess I'll just have to wait for the rumored 28-135 II, and hope that Canon gets their build quality right the second time around.

1623420148|2.0|Almost 1000 of positive reviews?You must be kidding me!<br />There is nothing to rave about, the story goes like this: chauvinistic ego maniac aka golden boy wants something that he cannot have, and after ridiculous stunts he finally gets the girl. The story is predictive, you know what will happen in 10 pages, there are no surprises. There is no beauty to the story, no romance per se.<br />If you are 16-year old girl, I'm sure you will like this book, but I'm out.

B004J4WN0I|1.0|Superman or maybe Atticus O'Sullivan.  This is actually the first review I have ever written.  The the book was a miserable attempt but I could not throw it out because it is an e-book.  The best I can do is delete it from my Kindle.  The book contains no character development, no real relationships between characters and only sophomoric attempts at humor.  Please check out the feature that allows you to read a portion of this book before you purchase it.  I wish I had.

B00DGKQ5I2|1.0|I don't understand.  This album sounds just like everything else being released these days.  Why is it so hard for bands to top their previous albums.  it seems like they just settle for the first thing that comes to mind.  This is noting compared to their last album.  Instead of Tracing back your roots, return to your roots.  Not too happy with this album.  It's def a one and done listen.  Maybe their next one will be better.
B00CXQL828|5.0|The Winery Dogs debut album is a game changer in the world of Rock n Roll. Fantastic bluesy hard rock that reminds you a lot of Led Zeppelin. And their not a direct rip off either.

B004YW4L5K|4.0|Neil Gaiman's America has been built by immigrants from all over the world, each bringing with them their cultural beliefs and folk legends. But once they assimilated, they abandoned their ancient gods. These gods are left to wallow in nostalgia for the good old days when their people worshipped them and made sacrifices in their name. Now, they're left to survive in whatever way they can--one as a con man, a second as a prostitute, another as a retired slaughterhouse worker, or a pair running a funeral home as undertakers.<br /><br />Mr. Gaiman vividly brings them all to life, each in a unique way, with the quirks of their former culture and the idiosyncrasies of their own special powers and history. But all have one thing in common, a sense of pathos, of not belonging in a land whose people have abandoned their traditions. But it gets worse. The descendants of those immigrants have adopted a new set of gods, represented by shopping malls, television, celebrities and the internet.<br /><br />Into all of this comes the main character, Shadow, a newly released convict. Shadow is troubled by his own past and recent tragedies, which have brought him to the point of numbness. But he's not a traditional protagonist. He's no mover of events (at least not until later in the book), but more of a guide, whose eyes are used by the author to take us on a fantastic tour of the sites and landscapes of America. And through his eyes, we witness the approaching apocalyptic battle between the old and new gods.<br /><br />The concept is so original, the writing magnificent. But this book is not for everyone. Shadow is distant and hard to relate to. The plot can slog at times. We're constantly told that a storm is coming as the old and the new clash. But it's a long time coming and when it arrives, it's not much of a storm.<br /><br />American Gods is a fascinating road show painted on the vast panorama of America. It should not be judged by traditional standards of character and plot.<br /><br />I read the 10th anniversary edition, which has added back 12,000 words cut for the original version. These additions include some beautifully written vignettes that, while interesting, are not central to the story and only slow down an already leisurely plot.<br /><br />If you lack the patience to get through almost 600 pages of great literature, you might want to pass on the new edition. If you love great writing as I do, this book is a one of a kind classic and worth the effort.<br /><br />I read the 10th anniversary edition, which has added back 12,000 words cut for the original version.

0307730700|5.0|I'll be honest, I don't read books regarding the military or have an interest much in the subject, so I was glad that for once I took a chance on a book that I might have overlooked otherwise. Eric Blehm tells a story of a guy that honestly you can learn a lot from. Regardless of your views on the military, he just portrays Adam as a guy who is very loyal and just trying to make it for his family. On top of that how his faith is weaved into the story is much more realistic than many other books you'll read in the Christian market, and they don't censor things to appease people.<br /><br />Summary: Adam Brown was a small town guy who grew up in a tight knit family. It seemed they were all going to grow up and go the normal route of life. Graduating schools, marrying, having families, and situating into safe job situations. Adam though veers very off the path imagined he would go though, and his drug addiction will forever change the rest of his life even after he begins to recover. With the support of his wife and family he joins the navy, and uses his own testimony to change the lives around him, and his loyalty and value of human life were something much needed in the circumstances he was in.<br /><br />Characters: The people in the story are real people, so this definitely adds to the impact of the story. Knowing what Adam's wife has lived through and experienced makes her a stand out person. I think it would be wonderful for her just to be able to share her own story one day. The main person of focus in the novel is Adam Brown though, and he really did give me a new perspective who do serve. Not that the previous one was bad, but just different. I think what stood out to me most about Adam was how he perceived people, even the enemy. Having to kill wasn't just something he considered his job. While it was something he had to do at times to survive this story doesn't depict him taking it lightly. Knowing he was having to take lives and what happened to those livesafter he took them wasn't something he tried to make light. He really seemed to grieve the tragedy of it.<br /><br />Writing: I think where the book suffers a bit is that it all seems to be wrote in past tense. We aren't living as the book is happening, but reading it as if it has already happened. Yes, it already has happened, but it's much more to read a book as if it is playing out before at that exact moment. Also, some of the technical details really way the story down.<br /><br />Plot: The plot is essentially Adam's life and his struggle as an addict, and overcoming it later on. Addicts can't fully overcome their previous addictions, but it show cases very well how he was always recovering, and always would be recovering. I think the book also shows that Adam and his wife made sure to instill certain things in their children that even people not fighting in the military don't. I've never heard kids speak some of the insights given in this book before. As said,  it would be powerful to read a book from his wife about what she experienced since much of this book is following where Adam went.<br /><br />Fearless will be a book that most attracted to military stories will pick up, and others might pass over who don't have a huge as interest in it. I encourage anyone though who likes an empowering tale to pick this one up though. Adam seems like he had his struggles and he was real, but he also had things about him that can be learned from.<br /><br />Rating 8 of 10.<br /><br />This book was provided by Waterbrook Multnomah in exchange for a review
B001BR5NN0|5.0|It's pointless to review such an epic movie. What can I say? It's nostalgic highschool perfection. Watch it if you haven't, watch it again if you have.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The upgrade of the maps was good, but my locations were lost, forecasts are not as clear and overall it is sluggish.
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|I really look forward to playing this game so for now I'm giving it five stars but if I don't find it appealing I'm bringing it to a no star and deleting it but I no I won't have to do that
B003TSEEDY|1.0|\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\"is the most trite and annoying book I have suffered through in a long time.  The characters are not likeable, and none of them are developed to the point where you can identify with them.  I stuck with it to the end, hoping that the author would finally pull the story together, but it never happened.  My advice...download or buy something else!
1400052181|5.0|Love this book!  I have been recommending it to everyone for a very interesting read.  I couldn't put it down.  I was so interested in learning about the family and the history of Henrietta Lacks.  The book arrived timely.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|It's A Wonderful Life is one of my all-time favorite movies and I was thrilled to find this collectors set with both a black and white disc as well as a second disc with the colorized version.  It's a TERRIFIC addition to my personal DVD collection.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|i think there should be more challenges and more coins and more people to but i like it and maybe there can be two big monsters trying to chase you
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|A great CD that is highly recommended.  Now What?! features the wide range of musical styles you would expect to hear at a Deep Purple concert with plenty of extended solos that show off the musical talents of the bands individual members.  Not only a must have for hard core fans, but something a casual listener would enjoy as well.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Proof of Heaven was very interesting story of a Doctor who became very ill.  His journey and his experience through his illness.  It was amazing that he survived.
0786956291|2.0|The original basic set was far better at teaching people to play the game.  This set has a scenario that you follow through to create your character.  The kids enjoy playing the scenario, but there is very little explanation of the game and how to play it after the scenario is finished.  It would be nice to see WOTC remake the first or second edition basic sets like they did with the advanced books as those versions were far superior to this one.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Maybe because it hits close to home, but people I know live it so why watch it when I can just visit a friend.  Hahahaha
B002SAUCBC|5.0|A gripping read, as always King delivers right up to the end, and even the end has an unexpected twist!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The reason why I gave it five stars is because I like to read the dictionary and learning new words and learning new words is fun
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I love how durable this is, great for skateboarding.The delivery was fast, easy to handle as well.<br />best for any filming no matter what you use it for.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game a is much like angry than run or temple run but is more child friendly and a lot of fun for younger children (3-4) however I am.much older than that and I still enjoyed it
B002SSUQFG|4.0|good quality for the price. straps are a little tacky and itchy too. the dials are very visible and the accuracy for time is great!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|rewarding, teh exercises are quite easy to follow. I highly recomend this booklet, the vw jetta execrcise was not my best choice.
B005ES11YW|5.0|I love the dual density material. This model has more material than the regular dual clog. It fits tighter than other models, but I think this is good for a &#34;sport&#34; clog. I love the fit and feel over land. The sole is ribbed to give more flexibility since it thicker. Also the back is raised slightly higher than other clog models. It has good stability and cushion. If I were on the dock or boating I would prefer the regular dual clog.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Very good solid story and great acting from all the leads.  A must see one of the few movies that i agree with critics on.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game<br /><br />needs more levels but love it<br />i want to play more it get addictive everybody in the family loves it we all help eachother
B0047Y17P2|5.0|As usual, Michael Connelly has again written a great mystery. His surprise ending was a perfect conclusion to the story. His books are always entertaining and I recommend them to all of my friends. I personally have quite a collection of his books.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game! Play it late at night in the dark with the sound up. TOTALLY worth the $ though it is fairy short.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app is hard at times but it is fun to play when you have nothing to do and I would recommend it for kids
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy the variety of the boards and how quick the game pieces leave the board and still allows you to continue your next selection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Being allergic to horses this game helps me take care of horses.. and it helps that the horse looks like my dad's horse
0553296981|5.0|Bought this for my daughter... although she hasn't read it yet we were satisfied with the delivery & the condition of the book itself!<br /><br />Thank You!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app just turned out to be a complete waste of time!  No reason to even have this for the Kindle Fire HD. I downloaded it and then almost immediately got rid of it after using one time.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|These puzzles take a great deal of concentration.  I don't think they're for everyone.  But I really like them.  I found some are extremely hard, and some are easy.  I like that you can try as many times as you need to with no penalty.  Also you can complete a puzzle and then go back and work it again to get it perfect.  In the other puzzles, you are dealing with getting pearls, but this one is mostly lights.  Very entertaining!
B00CXAAG6I|3.0|This book failed to make me any grumpier.  I don't care about Grumpy Cat and the whole phenomenon surrounding her is ridiculous.  Ever noticed that the people who like Grumpy Cat are cheerful types who also send around \\"cute\\" videos of kittens playing with strings or dogs or something? I have.  Read the book if you want.  I don't care.  You'll probably read Lil Bub's book too. Look at your page. Even Amazon thinks so.<br /><br />By the way, Kindle readers, I'd spring for the hard copy if you're inclined to buy the book.  Many of the pages are clearly intended to be double-layouts, so you're left swiping back and forth to get the full visual image, and the activities are of the kind requiring a pen/pencil.  (The three star review is aimed at the Kindle version; for a hard copy, I'd probably give it four).
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Great story very well presented, with rich characters. Its narrative maintain the suspense and includes marvelous descriptions of a fantastic world, full of secrets and wonders
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you should totally get this game its fun and awesome if you have played temple run you got to play this game its so much more than temple run
B00CL66FEQ|2.0|The movie was not anything special. The characters in the movie are more of the draw. I wouldn't recommend renting it fo $6...
B0084IG8TM|5.0|What a great story. Knew I would buy the movie when it came out. Love it, love it, love it!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|In turn, great if you love magic.<br /><br />Works for kindle fire fine.<br /><br />Can duel with other kindle 's as well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a very deep book. It makes you think in a different way on life and to live. It taught me to \\"participate\\" like Bill said, but overall it was a excellent book.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's Angry Birds, but it's Angry Birds with a twist, the graphics are amazing and it's so nice to a little more of a challange when it comes to knocking down stuff.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Very good book. I read it in three days, hard to put down. Ready for the next in the series!
B0049VZ222|5.0|My husband tried to get me to watch &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; for 3 seasons & I wanted nothing to do with it. I finally watched all three seasons when laid up sick 4TH of July weekend during a marathon; Now I can't wait until Oct for the new season!
B0074YVW1G|4.0|This book will be appreciated by introverts and the people who love them. Considering that one third to half the population are estimated to fall into this category then it's a worthwhile read for everyone. Having grown up as introvert and been labelled 'quiet' all my life, I found Cain's message that introverts are just as valid and have their own ways of contributing to be very empowering. Western culture highly values extroverts and if you are not outgoing and sociable then you can't help but feel there's something wrong with you.<br /><br />I like the distinction she makes between shyness and introversion because introverts aren't people who desperately yearn to socialise but are too timid, but rather we truly enjoy our own company and feel overwhelmed in large groups. Because introverts are much more sensitive to stimuli we also tend to dislike noisy, bright places and meeting a lot of new people at once. It's helped me to understand why nightclubs and concerts have always been my idea of hell. Cain takes a very even-handed approach in the book and doesn't try to claim that introverts are better than extroverts. Instead she points out the positive aspects of both personality types and what we can learn from each other. She also argues that introverts at times need to take on the traits of extroverts and this isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as introverts give themselves plenty of time to recharge and relax.<br /><br />The book does a very good job of validating and empowering introverts and trying to address the imbalance in our culture without undermining extroverts. She draws on a lot of science and research to back up her arguments and makes a very valuable contribution to this field of study which can also be understood by the average reader.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|my kids enjoy the game and they play it almost every morning and evening.  Great take on temple run lots of fun.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very good weather alert as well as everyday conditions at a glance.  Greatly helps with changing conditions to plan your days activites.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Very well done. Closely followed book plot line, characters well portrayed, costumes fit characters (at least how I saw them in my mind), special effects were excellent (dragons), and locales and buildings quite fitting for story.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|Steve Martin, Jack Black, Owen Wilson...what's not to love?  The bonus is the wonderful scenery in the film.  I'm not a birder and I still loved the movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A great angle seeing Rapp getting re-familiarized with himself.<br />During the period that I read this book it saddened me to learn of Vince's passing. It made me more sensitive to the plight of Stan Hurley in the book.<br /><br />I feel that with Vince's passing I have lost a friend.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Amazing work from Mr. Gaiman. I love the way you're transported into the mind of a child, with all his naivete and purity and imagination and unconditional trust. I especially love the vivid writing that draws such a colorful canvas. Just beautiful.<br /><br />So many twists and turns, but always to the benefit of the story. A wonderful read.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It was not as good as The Kite Runner but still held my interest very much.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|I'd like to start off this review by saying two things:<br />1. I love poetry<br />2. I have an affinity for men who are gifted with the pen.<br /><br />So basically I went into reading his work hoping that the author would bring the heat the way that I like it brought and he DEFINITELY did not disappoint.<br />I enjoyed the entire collection but being who I am, I have to pick my favorites.<br />My favorite 2 poems were entitled,\\"Lip Gloss & Undergarments\\" and \\"Obsessed\\".<br /><br />In \\"Lip Gloss & Undergarments\\", a man cannot actualize his desires to physically touch the woman of interest so instead he offers her the option of making him her lip gloss & undergarments so that he may experience her in that way.  Great visuals and awesome word play.<br /><br />My second fave, \\"Obsessed\\" is about a man speaking of the object of his fascination in way that makes you want to experience the feeling for yourself.  \\"...My worst nightmares are fond remembrances of your idiosyncrasies...\\"  words like these add to the spice and displays the author's ability to manipulate words to do his bidding.  Very expressive.<br /><br />Love this collection!<br />Great job.
1451627289|5.0|This book took me back to my youth and made me remember that terrible time in our lives.  Very Good
B000FVE3A2|1.0|Junk owned this watch for 6 months and it just stopped working, I called Invicta customer service and they told me to send $28.00 for return shipping and it would take at least 90 days to get it back, live and learn I guess I'll stick with Seiko from now on.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben told his story in a way that kept me totally engaged. I was like him before I read his story. I believed in science and I believed science was on the verge of explaining the mysteries of the Universe. I was not at all convinced that there was a loving presence of any sort that was &#34;pulling for us&#34; so to speak. Now I believe there is an unconditionally loving consciousness that can be called God. I have since listened to his webinars and have been listening to the accompanying audi sessions for meditation. I'm eager to hear more from him about his experience and what he learned when he went to the core. Now I, like he, am meshing my scientific knowledge with the knowing he now has and is sharing with us. I am more at peace with the concept of God. I get it that we can't fathom with our limited brains what's really going on in the vastness of everything that is.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|The first level functions as a tutorial of sorts, pay attention so you know how the different matching tiles work.<br /><br />This is a match 3 style game with fantasy adventure and RPG character development added and a side scrolling dungeon crawl. You resolve monster encounters by matching tiles. It is very time sensitive, you have to match quickly to progress far.<br /><br />You use loot from the dungeon to buy equipment upgrades to your sword, staff, shield and armor, as well as your personal training abilities such as damage or time bonuses.<br /><br />I think it is a good game and well worth checking out.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|My PBS stopped showing Doctor Who ages ago.  I was able to see David Tenant but the cable dropped the channel before Matt Smith came on.  Long time fans just don't give  up.
0786715103|4.0|Having been to Rwanda soon after the genocide, this book was a vivid reminder of a moment of madness in our human history.  A lesson for today!
B003XYE7R2|4.0|The Hound of the Baskervilles was a great story to read. It keeps you on you toes and longing for more. One difficulty reading the book was the dialect. I, myself, barely a teenager that is used to talking in the 2013 dialect with a very limited vocabulary, couldn't understand a few parts of the book. Overall, the book was one of the best and most captivating mysteries I have ever read, and that says something seeing as I have read over half of the Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, and Boxcar Children by the time I was in 5th grade. :)
B003Z0BWRM|2.0|The book was Harry porter and twilight put in to one with star war like father son relationship.. Predictable all the way., what a waste of time !!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|It is a quick but very enjoyable read  I recommend it to anyone who likes to let their imagination run wild.  Wish it had been longer.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|My favorite author now. Great style and scenario. Read everithing that he wrote and grateful for his work. I wish him long creative life!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Maybe it's just because I enjoyed the book, and the characters so much, that I was disappointed when I reached the end (much more of a surprise on an e-book without the diminishing thickness of paper pages by which to gauge).  In the afterward Neil Gaiman does admit that the book started as a short story but there was more to tell.  Humm, can't tell how &#34;thick&#34; an e-book is either but it seems novella sized.<br /><br />Exciting things happen to a seven year old boy, cats are lost and found, and at the end things are neatly tied up and there is a...sad sense of closure.  There also seem to be so much more that could have been said.  Perhaps Mr. Gaiman will revisit the three ladies of the story--there is SO much unsaid!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I wasn't sure I would like this solitaire, although I love playing classical solitaire<br />.  I really do like this game and consider it challenging.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I've learned in life that not everyone has the same tastes...in music, I was absolutely astounded that millions of people rushed to the record store in the 60's to buy a song I HATED, with a lyric something like &#34;Do-mun Eek, a-leeka leek...&#34; by The Singing Nun.<br /><br />So we have to allow for a variance in what people think is &#34;art,&#34; obviously.<br /><br />I gobble up the Lee Child books about Jack Reacher like handfuls of popcorn: I don't expect to get any real nourishment from them, but man, are they a blast to read.  When the Kindle warns that I'm coming near the end of them, I slow down and read each word so it sounds like James Earl Jones is the voice I hear, speaking the words.<br /><br />&#34;A Wanted Man&#34; was just as good as the dozen or so that came before it.  I balked at buying it for half a second, as I read some reviews in here, that whined about how it wasn't up to the par of its predecessors.<br /><br />It makes me wonder just what some people EXPECT from a Reacher novel.  It isn't supposed to be a documentary, so some of the twists and turns of the story are not going to be &#34;realistic.&#34;<br /><br />If you instead are hoping for yet another high adventure tale, this book will not disappoint.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|My favorite author now. Great style and scenario. Read everithing that he wrote and grateful for his work. I wish him long creative life!
B00BJG7H3M|5.0|Louis Litt made a Harold reference - I love Harold I wish he was still a constant in season 2.  This is still an awesome show!
B001MYKZ6C|1.0|First of all these are to review the product not the actual movie.<br />Second of all this DVD doesnt even work!<br />Why would they sell it in the US if it doesnt play on DVD players bought in the US I'm so mad at myself for not reading the fine print. Paid the money to save me a trip to target n I ended up throwing away my money for a useless disc with no function to me. >=[ great.<br />I love this movie. This seller should be banned the idea is just ridiculous.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging as you move up every level to use the clues to escape the room! Love the way you have multiple rooms within each level.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Addictive and fun. I'm glad I bought this one. Enough of a challenge to keep my attention. I would purchase a sequel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is amazing. I cant stop playing it. if you ever get bored this is a great game to get.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|One of the best new bands I've heard in some time.  Thanks to Jay Leno, where I heard them for the first time.  Bought this CD the very next day!
1878424114|2.0|I recently purchased this book as &#34;new&#34;. When I received it and leafing through it,, I noticed many places in the book where sentences and sections had been underlined in pencil. This is DEFINITELY not a &#34;new&#34; book. I am very disappointed since I paid for a new book. I would hesitate to purchase another book under these circumstances!
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I came out of the theater after seeing this movie being underwhelmed by much of it but at the same time wanting desperately to own the soundtrack. The mix of orchestral and electronic music is masterful and the scope of the soundtrack is simply epic.This is an astounding piece of work, and I now effectively enjoy the movie as a 2 hour Daft Punk music video.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Presumed Innocent. Anyone else think this or is it just me? I don't want to talk about Presumed(in case some haven't read it). Just checking to see if others felt this way. This book was one that I couldn't put down but I enjoyed the Presumed ending more.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|The movie is great. The action looks great in Blu Ray, but add 3D, Wow is the word. I recommend the 3D movie.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|I saw Ponyo when it was in theaters and I loved it. I recently got my boyfriend into Ghibli films and I was shocked when I realized I didn't own it, so naturally I ordered it from amazon. It arrived quickly which excited me beyond belief. Then when I got it inside and open the package, much to my shock I was sent a used copy. I was under the impression I was being sent a brand new copy since I hadn't clicked add to cart from the used listings section of the product. That was a minor bummer, so I popped it into my dvd player anyway. The back of the dvd box had a sticker on it that read \\"used, very good\\" which turned out to be a load of crap. The disk had quite a few scratches into it, but I still had faith. About five or so minutes into the film the disk wouldn't read. So not worth the almost twenty bucks it cost me.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I love my alpha males, and Dragos is dark, dangerous and sexy.  Dragos also is also protective and caring and learns how to deal with his strong willed mate.  Pia is tough, funny and strong in ways that she did not realize.  I enjoyed the hot  romance.  The relationships and dialog between the characters made me laugh.  i enjoyed  seeing Pia develop into her own.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I had to skim the last third of this book. Couldn't take any more because of its adolescent style. Trite and hackneyed with a lot of football.
B007ZI06FE|3.0|Partly entertaining, not too badly written, partly bit boring and repetitive bit cheesy too. I probably wont be reading more books in this series.
B0057VY45O|5.0|Being in my 60's I have seen thousands different T.V. shows. Some were good and some were bad. Gunsmoke, Mash, Star Trek the next generation, Lucy, Dick Van Dyke and on and on..... Next to my all-time favorite, Star Trek the next generation, this is a close second. The complex plot each week makes the viewer think on multiple levels and the acting is incredible. I will be starting my second time watching the series and this time I will share it with someone else.<br />I couldn't possibly give this program a higher rating because 5 starts in as high as I can go. It is worth every second you will spend watching it. Start from the pilot and enjoy................
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|Perfect movie for 3D viewing.  The tornado/waterfall/intro to Oz sequence is great demo material for your 3D TV.  This version is difficult to find in stores and does not come with 2D Blu-ray or DVD, but is definitely worth it.  3D is the only way to watch this movie.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i got this for my grandson and now i am also playing it ......often. i like it and have told a couple of my friends. a little expensive so i didn't but it for the macbook from the app store($9.99) tablet only for now($.99)
B002VCR03A|5.0|All I can ask is when we get more to this trilogy? it got me mesmerized. I miss this book after I've read it. That is the best indicator for a very good book. Don't miss it.
B008200LHW|5.0|We like this small GPS to plug into our computer and show our boat position on the chart. It was fun to watch where we are on the globe.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Have just completed all the levels...now am disappointed that the game just ends. Was expecting to go on to more difficult levels.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I use this for reading and i do like it I only would like the tools to stay up for selection a little longer. overall i do like this app.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|Dunno what to say, bit dark and gloomy, lovely written story. This I added as my all time favorite books. Definitely going to read this again and again.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I play this when I am going to sleep to drown out the TV that my husband needs to fall alseep.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|5 stars alone don't cut it! I suppose this answers answers this question without going into several hundred pages of pure ecstasy.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is very talented.  All the song he sings are very good and easy to sing along to.  I definitely recommend this CD.  It not only is great to listen to but it helps me get through some crazy traffic.
0316174483|5.0|I can't draw any better than a preschooler but this book has easy step-by-step instructions for making children's fingerprints into adorable keepsake pictures.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|dis game is really fun and I don't lie<br />I really really recomand this game for pet lover ecpelly horse lovers
B005LAIH2M|5.0|We love this movie, great take on Hansel and Gretel..No for little kids although. Would not want to make thoses witches mad at me..  :)
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This was rec'd in excellent condition and we are now on disc 4 of the second season. Would highly recomment it. Packaging is great, not falling apart at all. I had read that somewhere on a comment.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Unusual literary style. Held my interest til the end. Not a true crime story in a sense but intriguing just the same.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It's hard to review this book fairly because the author's previous work (Kite Runner) set the bar very high.<br /><br />Khalid Hosseini is a master of imagery, and this book is no exception to this aspect of his writing.  I think the first half of the book is tremendously vivid in it's descriptions which makes it very enjoyable.  The rest of it, not so.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is great.  The personalities of the characters are all so entertaining and the cast is remarkable.  So happy I started watching this show!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Pretty good adaptation from the books.<br />I really enjoyed it, and look forward to the next one! Even the hubby liked it.
B005DI66N4|4.0|This was a great story about survival and friendship and grief.  I am amazed at the ability people can have to withstand so much pain and suffering all to gain freedom.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Like a George Pal disaster film produced and directed by the Coen Brothers, Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle is the funniest book ever written about the end of the world. Herein, a third world dictator comes into possession of a top-secret WMD known as Ice Nine--a single crystal of which is capable of freezing any water it touches solid, regardless of temperature. Zany antics ensue, and civilization as we know it is destroyed--but not before we've been treated to a whirlwind of crazy characters, embarrassing incident, and the sort of mordant philosophizing that Kurt Vonnegut was famous for.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse Five may be Vonnegut's most well-known book, but I contend that Cat's Cradle remains his true masterpiece.
7119005901|3.0|the actual books were fantastic; Moss Roberts' translation is simply wonderful! however, the packaging was damaged so completely that the books were warped almost to the point of disfigurement... quite a shame considering how wonderful the actual text is.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|After looking far and wide for a comfortable back to ease the strain on my shoulder from my shoulder bag, I thought I would try this.  What a find.  This bag is almost identacle to the Canon backpack, but without the big &#34;Canon&#34; logo which also means &#34;Steal me, I've got expensive stuff inside&#34;.  This bag is very comfortable for me and I can walk around almost all day and feel great.  I'm a 6FT, 170 lb, 67year old male.  This is what I have in the backpack:<br /><br />Canon 60D w 18-135mm zoom lens attached;<br />Canon 75-300mm zoom w/hood<br />Canon 50mm prime w/hood<br />Canon 85mm prime w/hood<br />Canon 55-250mm  zoom w/hood<br />Vivitar shoe flash, extra batteries, HD cards, filters, books, pens, etc.<br />There are straps on the side for a small tripod or monopod, but no mesh or pocket for a water bottle.<br />Oh yes, did I mention its only 30 bucks at Amazon?  For a good inexpensive backpack, look no further, this is it.

B00B7NPRY8|5.0|Dune seems to inspire as much hatred as love, perhaps because--like its fantasy counterpart, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings--it's a big, brash, galumphing book boasting noble heroes, vile villains, wondrous landscapes and (most importantly for science fiction) big ideas, all requiring a Rosetta Stone of glossaries, appendices and meta-documentation to comprehend. Some people, apparently, don't like fiction that requires a glossaries, appendices and meta-documents to make sense.<br /><br />To hell with those people, I say. Dune is a great book--and a great work of science fiction--precisely because it is so ambitious and all-encompassing. It has the sweep and complexity of James Michenor, the intellectual rigor of Arthur Clarke, the socio-political insight of Robert Heinlein, the psychological and ecological acumen of Ursula LeGuin, and the whiz-bang thrills of Edgar Rice Burroughs. It is the grandest of space operas and the deepest of ruminations on power, politics, religion, ecology, and empire.<br /><br />In short--it's got something for everyone. Dive in!

B005LAIH2M|5.0|Will not win any Oscars, but just a good old fashion goofy action movie.  Don't try to over analyze it, just get some popcorn, sit back and enjoy.  Great mindless fun.
B000089RVR|5.0|I bought this as a gift to my mother on mothers day and she absolutely loves it! It came in the mail a week before I had originally planned!
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|For a self-proclaimed optimist, the late-great Ray Bradbury sure was adept at breaking hearts and exposing ugly truths. Elsewhere, I've expressed my affection for his horror novel Something Wicked This Way Comes. Here, I sing the praises of his elegiac science fantasy The Martian Chronicles, wherein a series of short stories paint a panoramic portrait of an inhabited world that is colonized and reborn under new management. It is the American myth played out on an interplanetary scale, and an absolutely gorgeous poem to beauty, loss, frontiers, and transformation. At the best of times, it soars with evocative imagery and stirring (or even humorous) considerations of what first contact and planetary colonization might be like... but ultimately, it breaks your heart, dramatizing the fundamental truth that all things change, everything dies, and that, sometimes, we unwittingly help these processes along, often to our detriment.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|Peeping Tom is another awesome band that Mike Patton has created. Very cool songs and I keep listening to it over and over again.
B00009RDG9|5.0|It is a little bit like Rambo and there is a cool knife in the movie. Who doesn't like knives? Who doesn't like Rambo? 5 stars
B0053TMP24|5.0|Great plot and great narrative. I love it how Percy came book to the series. And the end keeps you wanting more!
B001JNNDEW|5.0|Caught this movie on TV, and decided I had to have it to see again.  Gary Cole broke me up completely.  If you ever worked in an office environment do not miss this movie.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Really makes one wonder with all the recent crashes.  Good thing I won't be flying anything soon.  Makes you think though.
B00746O3X8|1.0|I expected a much better quality from a product with such positive reviews. The straps are thin and therefore uncomfortable (they actually hurt), and I wouldn't want to trust such flimsy safety harness with my expensive cameras. All materials look and feel cheaply made. I have a five-dolar belt from the same manufacturer that had lower rating and is at the same time much better and sturdier. It's a shame that to return such a bad product it I also have to pay a two-way delivery and a restocking fee.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I was so sad when i finished the series of Percy Jackson. But now with the Heroes Of Olympus the series has taken a new level.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|New format sucks. Lacks the info of the old format and is not navigable. It takes more steps to navigate and is a step backward instead of forewarned.
B002KKCVR8|3.0|This was a gift for my dad since he liked his old ones. Unfortunately he said it doesn't have the same feel as the older model.

0930289234|5.0|If you are a fan of graphic novels, comics, superheroes, science fiction or even philosophy for that matter you will love this amazing piece of literature. Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons and John Higgins created one of the greatest stories of all time, you owe it to yourself to pick up this book.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I'm not sure what the Fox executives were thinking when they made the decision to cancel the series, because Firefly is sci-fi at its best. Whedon balances the sci-fi and western style with perfection, giving it a feel similar to A New Hope and Bonanza meeting in a food processor. The only complaint I could give is the initial irritation from the title song, but it grows on you. The acting is great, the story is great, and Joss Whedon is great.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love this game.  Gets a bit frustrating in trying to figure out all the puzzles but fun worth the frustration.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I love the older Star Trek movies, like The Wrath of Khan, The Undiscovered Country, The Voyage Home, and First Contact. After the lackluster Nemesis from 2002, the franchise was exhausted, and needed new perspective, not to mention money. So, in a world of high budget CGI and a new crop of talented directors, the stage was set for a new, fresh-looking reboot of the legendary series. This first film manages to tell the story in a lighthearted tone, while keeping emphasis on the origins of the main characters, all the while balancing it all with intense action at times. While this film resonates with older fans and newer fans alike, the most noticeable and obvious element is the general direction that this three part series is headed; most of us knew that its successor (Into Darkness) would have lots of action and eye candy for the new fans out there. This is a necessary move in terms of long-term sustainability, and I like this movie for the most part, but must admit that I'm a little more old school when it comes to the Star Trek franchise. This movie works well on many fronts, and certainly holds my interest, but I like the old movies a tad bit more because there's substance over style, or more brain and less brawn. Still, this flick is a must-see; the actors are superb in their roles and develop throughout the film. If I have one chief criticism of the way these movies are being made, it's the often shaky camerawork, as is the case for many films these days. I just don't like watching a movie feeling like I'm on some amusement park ride. I just hope the new Star Wars movie in 2015 won't have this distraction.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Found Clean Master in the free apps and installed it right away. Clean Master did a great job of clearing out unnecessary files and other memory space hogs. So happy to have this tool for my first gen Kindle Fire. Now if it would just get rid of the factory installed apps that I don't use :)
B00783NPVI|5.0|This collector's DVD is very nice!  I thought the prop flowers going to be in a flimsy plastic, but it is packaged beautifully so it can be displayed and has the COA on the back.  I love the fact that I have something in my house from my favorite scene of the series!

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game. Challenges were different from other \\"escape\\" games, but not so hard as to be impossible. No need for tips, as long as you search the rooms thoroughly and think critically. Can't wait for more rooms to be added.

1451626096|5.0|The Tudor dynasty is born on the back of Richard III's defeat at Bosworth Field, a pyrrhic victory it seems, with the specter of the Princes in the Tower bedeviling the new king, Henry Tudor. Whether real or carefully staged by Yorkist supporters, the threat casts a pall over Henry VII's reign, diminishing his power and his peace of mind. The major players are larger-than-life: Henry VII; his domineering and fanatical mother, Margaret Beaufort; bride Elizabeth of York, former lover of Richard III; Elizabeth's mother, Elizabeth Woodville, keeper of secrets and spinner of spells; and the \\"pretender\\", whomever he might be, waiting to unseat Henry and return the throne to the Yorks.<br /><br />The lines are drawn from the first days, king and mother on one side, everyone else on the other, Beaufort managing the court as though she is queen, usurping the queen's quarters, penning strict rules for court behavior (meant to marginalize Elizabeth), building an elaborate network of spies. For his part, Henry is the fruit of his mother's  ambition, a ruler lacking the accoutrements of princes, exile robbing him of the intuitions of a natural ruler: \\"What matters is that you have not made your boy the beloved of England.\\" At its best historical fiction breathes life into desiccated facts. This is Gregory's m&eacute;tier, an author who inhabits the personalities of her characters with trenchant wit, ever cognizant of the ironies of fate, particularly in her rendering of Elizabeth of York, trapped in a marriage with the man who killed her beloved, bearing the Tudor children, witness to Henry's weakness and the fanaticism of his mother, who would bend God's will her to own.<br /><br />Loathing turns to pity, even affection (\\"On the contrary, it makes me tender towards him\\") as Elizabeth observes the true nature of the Tudor king, his inability to bond with his subjects, his fear of the pretender by whatever name (Henry's \\"looking-glass king\\"), her own mother's secret cooperation on behalf of the York cause (even after the birth of an heir) and the tantalizing possibility that her younger brother is alive, albeit in hiding. The paranoia is pervasive, Henry besieged by rumors and rebellions, Beaufort often white-knuckled with fear, prostate to the God who has delivered her son to his destiny: \\"Nobody in the world could be more sure than my mother that her son should be king.\\" This dynastic marriage of York and Tudor sets the stage for the future of England's game of princes and their heirs, murders and prophecies lingering for centuries, the mystery of the Princes in the Tower unresolved, yet perhaps made clearer by Gregory's keen and informed blend of history and fiction.

1451695195|3.0|OK, SO DR. ALEXANDER ISN'T PERFECT. He had lawsuits against him, had practice 'deficits' where he didn't earn as he was supposed to...etc etc.<br />If you are interested in his 'MUD':see end**<br /><br />But he is a very good writer, and as a retired surgeon/physician and also someone who HAS HAD OOB experiences--I feel he did his BEST to describe them. As someone who has traveled on these inner realms, I think where he went was not what he thinks but that's ok too. The OM realm has a being many who see think is god but IT is just a ruler of that realm, not God at all--but someone raised Christian experiencing this? He was merely in the belief band heaven of Christians. There are MANY HEAVENS, each fitted to their people's beliefs. The OM that so many Christians are up in arms against? OM is the SOUND of the astral plane. MANY RELIGIONS in the East have written of the OM--it is a sound vibration in that realm.<br /><br />Higher realms have other sounds.<br /><br />Because Dr. Alexander spoke of not only the light--which many NDE'ers write of--but also the SOUND, I think his experience is valid. He tries as best he can to EXPLAIN IT, but through his own belief system--namely, Christian. The orbs of light become angels, the guide next to him his butterfly winged guardian angel and then **SPOILER ALERT!**his long lost sister.<br /><br />Were they? What are angels but higher beings that we attribute our own beliefs to?<br /><br />Perhaps if he had been raised Buddhist he would have gone somewhere appropriate for that belief system, and the angels would be Bodhisattas...beings who have evolved toward perfection of soul.<br /><br />IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.<br />HE WILL BE ATTACKED BECAUSE HE HAD FAULTS (HE ADMITTED in his book w/o details!!!), WAS SUED, WAS TERMINATED...So what?<br /><br />Almost EVERY neurosurgeon gets sued--their job is highly litigious. He ADMITS in the book a long slump, depression, where his practice suffered tremendously. That he never mentions lawsuits and termination--so? That isn't the point of his story. We can judge him on it or read between the lines and SEE what he is trying to convey.<br /><br />I feel he has written a good book for the Christian oriented and for those non christians--read the facts and see what you want.<br /><br />He mentions Robert Monroe's work in hemi-sync (he passed away in the 90's but his three books on OOB travel are classics and his organization, the Monroe Institute, carries on) I also have learned with Monroe's system and I feel it FAR SUPERIOR to the 'belief system' I was deeply committed to for over 30 YEARS. Monroe' org is non-denominational and the CD's with his researched sounds work for ANY belief system--which Dr. Alexander is trying valiently to appeal to!<br /><br />So, mud slingers? The Christian FEAR devil mongers? (Where is your faith in Jesus to be so fearful of someone trying to spread that God is LOVE?)<br />Give the guy a break! He can teach-share-spread a lot of GOOD here!<br /><br />Aloha<br />**[...]<br /><br />*from Wikipedia:<br />In a wider-ranging investigation of Alexander's story and medical background, Esquire magazine reported (August 2013 issue) that prior to the publication of Proof of Heaven, Alexander had been terminated or suspended from multiple hospital positions, and had been the subject of several malpractice lawsuits, including at least one involving the alteration of medical records to cover up a medical error.[11][12] The magazine also found what it claimed were discrepencies with regard to Alexander's version of events in the book.[11][12][13]<br />Alexander issued a statement after the Esquire article's publication:[13]<br />I wrote a truthful account of my experiences in PROOF OF HEAVEN and have acknowledged in the book both my professional and personal accomplishments and my setbacks. I stand by every word in this book and have made its message the purpose of my life. Esquire's cynical article distorts the facts of my 25-year career as a neurosurgeon and is a textbook example of how unsupported assertions and cherry-picked information can be assembled at the expense of the truth.<br />-- Dr. Eben Alexander, July 2013.[13]ngers?

B00CWY76CC|5.0|as others have said its not too difficult, but it is fun to complete the challenges. i look forward to more levels.
B002C4YYEU|3.0|The whole concept of someone growing young is a little far fetched but all in all a great movie. Brad Pitt was great as usual.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I would give the game a five, but oh my gosh, you only get to play like three hands before you've out of coins and they expect you to pay to buy more. No thanks.

B0049VVE7Y|3.0|I thought this series was okay, I certainly didn't get hooked on it like so many others.  Maybe future seasons pick up the pace, but I'll wait for it to hit Prime (if it ever does).  As far as AMC goes, I much prefer Mad Men, and in general I thought Falling Skies was a much more compelling series.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My kids and I spent a rainy afternoon obsessed with this game-compelling storyline, challenging puzzles, realistic graphics, and haunting music and sound effects. I do wish it was longer, but in the way you wish a good book wouldn't end. Because it is so detailed, it is worth the price, despite being shorter than most games. If you don't take the hints, you could stretch play, but it is hard to resist when you get stuck.
0395925037|5.0|I Love History and now I know a little bit more about the man that is Adolf Hitler.<br />Must have for anyone that loves WW2
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I purchased this book as soon as I read the first few sentences of a review in the New York Times, where the reviewer (Barbara Kingsolver) said, &#34;To experience this novel exactly as the author intended, a reader should avoid the flap copy and everything else written about it. Including this review.&#34; I immediately stopped reading the review, went to the Kindle store, bought the book, and jumped right in!<br /><br />And she was correct ... don't read anything about it, it will skew your perspective.<br /><br />All I will say is that it did get a little preachy now and then, but that was a small price to pay for such an enjoyable read.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|This is a great family movie. I recently purchase an LG 3D TV and this plays flawlessly on my system. This will definitely become a family tradition during the Christmas holidays. I would highly recommend this to everyone 3D collection.

B007PT1PEY|5.0|It was such a treat to read all of the Sherlock Holmes stories at once.  I can't believe that there were so many I hadn't read before!  I was totally engaged with all the characters, and there wasn't one story that I disliked.  After a while, some felt a little repetitious, but even then I enjoyed them.<br /><br />It was so interesting to plunge myself into the time period.  Since I read quite a few contemporary mysteries, it was also fascinating to see how the genre has changed over the years ... and how much it has stayed the same.<br /><br />As long as you remember the historical context, and don't expect modern conceits, anyone who enjoys mysteries would thoroughly enjoy this compilation.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|not quite a comedy, but a great movie with really great acting.  it stays with you- in a good way.

B00BAXTYBW|1.0|Beyond bad, this movie stinks on ice. It should have been called, \\"Star Trek V The Search For Shatner's Talent.\\"<br /><br />From Science Fiction's greatest three musketeers we have row row row your boat being sung by Nimoy, Kelly and Shatner on a camp out where Shatner is the only one doing activities while his crew stumble around the woods pretending their having fun watching an out of shape captain mountain climb.  Really? They could have opened this movie at a country club watching Shatner playing a round of golf and it would have been more believable and entertaining than this.<br /><br />The movie rolls from one tired conveyance to the next. From, \\"the Enterprise\\" is the only ship for the job with it not working correctly and manned by a skeleton crew, to the hippy vulcan who gives everyone a psychic LSD trip down pain lane to lift their troubles and turn them into mutinous cult fanatics.<br /><br />Finally they reach the home of god where we learn the old lesson, any god you can kill, you should kill.<br /><br />Reminded me of a bit from the first star wars movie when Harrison Ford wanted to tie George Lucas to a chair and make him read the lines he was expecting folks to deliver. Clearly there was no creative push back on Shatner with this movie and no amount of polish could put a shine on this steaming loaf.
0718157834|5.0|Oh my gawd, What an awful, awful book **I say with tears streaming down my face, a knot in my chest, eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep and the tiniest of smiles on my face**<br /><br />Wow, okay it's been a few days now since I finished this \\"awful\\" book and while I have somewhat recovered from the gut wrenching experience of ME BEFORE YOU, I still haven`t been able to get the story out of my mind.<br /><br />This was an utterly absorbing read that challenged me to examine my own life and choices. It is thought-provoking and entertaining, heartbreaking and poignant and impossible to put down. Filled with vibrant characters it captures the complexities of love but at its heart it's a story about life. About living and living well, taking life by the horns and using the hell out of it. As Will says, \\"Just live\\".<br /><br />I should start by saying that I knew next to nothing about the story going in (which I recommend) and also that within the first few chapters thought I had the whole thing figured out (which I didn't) I just assumed it was going to be your basic chick-lit; you know, a bumbling, relatable heroine, a cast of worthy, somewhat eccentric secondary characters including meddling siblings and drunken BFF's tied together with a love story. I thought it would be a cute, clever read. Ultimately yes, it was all these things but....  It was also about halfway in that I became aware that I was no longer reading the book I thought I was. That I was dealing with a very controversial and sensitive subject, that I was being tested, challenged and changed and that the ending (oh my god she's not going to go there is she?) was going to hurt like hell.<br /><br />Will Traynor is a handsome, high-powered takeover specialist in London who sleeps with beautiful women and travels the world. Skiing, bungee jumping, mountain climbing, basically just looking for the next great adrenaline rush. His life has always been one of wealth, privilege and adventure until one rainy morning when a motorcycle accident renders him a quadriplegic and places him back on his parent's estate in need of 24 hour care.<br /><br />In the same small town Louisa Clarke lives with her financially strapped family (who are hilarious and I loved) dates a man she assumes she'll marry but isn`t honestly all that bothered either way and is more than satisfied with her modest job at the Buttered Bun Caf&eacute;. She doesn't want or expect much from her life but all that's about to change.<br /><br />When Lou suddenly loses her job she finds herself with no qualifications and a family that's depending on her for a paycheque. With few options she finds herself at the job center where she reluctantly agrees to an interview as a caretaker. Really, she's to be more of a paid companion; she won't have to do any of the medical things just \\"be\\" with her charge. Easier said than done though, Will Traynor is a bitter, depressed, intimidating and hostile man.<br /><br />Granted he is confined to his motorised wheelchair and in constant pain, with only limited movement of his neck and one hand.

Thank you JoJo Moyes.ing when a motorcycle accident renders him a quadriplegic and places him back on his parent's estate in need of 24 hour care.<br /><br />In the same small town Louisa Clarke lives with her financially strapped family (who are hilarious and I loved) dates a man she assumes she'll marry but isn`t honestly all that bothered either way and is more than satisfied with her modest job at the Buttered Bun Café. She doesn't want or expect much from her life but all that's about to change.<br /><br />When Lou suddenly loses her job she finds herself with no qualifications and a family that's depending on her for a paycheque. With few options she finds herself at the job center where she reluctantly agrees to an interview as a caretaker.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|When I finished the last room, I wanted more. A good game to pass the time.  A good progression of difficulty.

B0091REZMW|5.0|After trawling through so many puzzle and hidden object games that let you play a level or two, then ask you to pay to continue, it's refreshing to find a full version that is genuinely free. Haven't been playing long, but so far, I've found no pay-for content that you can't get by waiting and leveling up, or asking friends. The lack of a purchase charge doesn't seem to have had any detrimental effect on the quality of the game, as the storyline is fresh and funny. Features like the monsters and ghosts circling the map for you to challenge, as well as the variety of game modes in each room create more variety than I've seen in a number of games they asked for £2-3 plus to play.<br /><br />All in all, I'm impressed. I'll definitely be giving the makers a look when I'm next looking for a new game to play!
B005LAII80|5.0|stallones version was a great film but it became to star driven, this one held on to the comics, he never takes the helmet off, it was his choice cause he wanted the character to be the star....that says it all
B008JFUR10|5.0|PACIFIC RIM is Guillermo del Toro's love-letter to the millions of giant monster / giant robot fans around the globe. Though it has huge appeal to the modern video game, CGI-heavy / TRANSFORMERS crowd, it's also a godsend for anyone raised on GODZILLA, GAMERA, ULTRAMAN, or anything similar. -SPOILER ALERT- The story concerns an invasion by a race of distant beings who have found a portal into our world. They unleash their gargantuan creatures to destroy mankind. The humans band together, building a fleet of titanic fighting robots to defend against the alien onslaught. The robo-technology is fantastic! The giant monsters are very realistic, non-cheeezy abominations! The battles are amazingly intense. Even so, there is a human story to be told in this film. The characters aren't just gung-ho TOP GUN types on a mission. Well, at least not all of them. There's a beating heart beneath all of the clashing steel and exploding cityscapes. Highly recommended...
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Almost read like a &#34;best seller&#34;.  Liked that it wasn't all plain sailing. What ever is? So why did he leave the forces? Surely not to make his millions selling the story!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I agree with others that the recent update down graded this app.  Loved it before the changes and now it is second rate. Sorry it was changed.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|tarantino grindhouse was a bit off setting and di not feel like him this one is also a step away from his norm but like all his films its about the script, the conversations immerse you so much you will never forget this movie
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the best series I have read sine HP. I don't know what to do except read it all over again.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This a great game. It is fun to watch your park grow. Having the underwater and glacier park makes it even more interesting.  If you have a preteen in your home this would be so.ethnic that you could work on together. You must have patience keep from spending your bucks. But you can earn more. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B005I6EU48|5.0|EXCELLENT!!!  This cover is just what I wanted.  Looks like a book and feels nice in your hand.  Thank you!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Completely addictive and wonderful game. The dragons are very cute too! I bought it expecting to only play a few times, but I doubt I'll be able to put it down until I've bred every single dragon :)
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Been using it for a couple weeks now and it is the business.  Feels great in my hand, crisp and responsive.  Looks cool too; not ridiculous like a lot of other gaming mouses these days.  So if you want a mouse that looks like a three year old randomly glued buttons to some Lincoln logs this is not the mouse for you.  Highly recommend it.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|It's so sweet natured and is full of values and lessons and real life perspectives. This is a fantastic movie for young children. Life us not cookie cutter and should not always be portrayed as such. There are children who don't have family and are treated poorly by those that should be taking care of them. Don't judge a nook by its cover. Have fun & enjoy life. Love & never forget who really matters to you. And seriously! The Minions RULE!!!
B001CDWFPC|2.0|Although I like the extra information contained in this bible, the backgrounds of each book etc.,it is too difficult to navigate around in kindle. The book tells you you can pyt book abbreviation and it will go to that book, but it does not. You have to type name of book in search and it pulls up every word of that books name in the bible. Too difficult. I think in hardback its good book. I have downloaded a bible app where I am able to go to exactly the book and verse I want. Logos Bible
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I could not play this game at all installed this over and over again and would not play at all I don't like this game
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Not to give anything away, but as previous seasons proved, the writers of this show appear to love tragedy or hate the upper class. I like drama, but this season went over the top. One can only take so much & this season did me in going ridiculously outside the bounds of believability. I believe you have lost a fan, Hugh, as I have nothing to look forward to in the next season after you wrote that last scene. I'm sure there are others who are addicted to outlandish fates that will keep watching fervantly, though, so no worries.
0399226907|5.0|My nine month old daughter loves Eric Carle and so far this is her favorite book!  She loves to put her little fingers into the holes as I count the fruit.  Recommend!
1416972242|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful- my favorite in the series and my favorite series ever.  Anyone interested in young paranormal/fantasy with twisted romance entanglements will adore this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome! It makes it like your taking care of a real horse. I highly recommend this app.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat. I love the actors in it. Paul Walker is a favorite as well as Vin Diesel.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Interesting perspective as it is written from a child's view.  In light of recent headlines this story sadly rings true. Very well written.
B0007WYCLY|5.0|Excellent product, we thank you very much for the amazing monchichi. I may order another one even of bigger size
B000MR9D5E|5.0|What can I say?  A picture is worth a thousand words and this series is worth a million pictures.  The images contained in this set are awesome.  There are places that some people will never get a chance to visit. And even if they could, there are things there that they would never be able to see.  Those are the things you will see in this series.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|I'm a big fan of all of the original Evil Dead movies. Despite not having the cheesy special effects and likely having a larger budget than the original, this remake strays so far from the original story line/concept that I wouldn't even consider it a remake.  Very little was spent of the fact that the BOOK is the key to everything (and plays a larger role in the subsequent movies). I also missed the humor that was in the original. This remake is merely a gore fest with little to no plot line.<br /><br />It is entertaining to watch and scary at times but I say watch the original instead.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|Not worth the download.  This game freezes each and every single time on level 4.  When you restart your phone, it starts you at level 3.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A Dance With Dragons tore me up in the best way. The Reek chapters absolutely killed me. Definitely worth a read.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|For me, the greatness that is Downton Abbey just continues to improve.  Maggie Smith is fantastic as the aristocraic matriarch of the family who resists change at all turns and this definitely was a season of changes.  What I thought was interesting was that these changes that affected the family took place on a global as well as personal level. I could see shades of Fiddler On the Roof at times, but from a more non-religious aristocratic perspective.  I thoroughly love this series. The writing is superb.  The acting is flawless.  There is detail to the nth degree in the costumes, hairstyles, makeup etc.  And of course, the estate itself is fantastic and being an actual estate it really lends an air of versimilitude to the  series.  I also enjoy the fact the most of the cast interviews are done on the set and with everyone in full costume and makeup.  And it appears that most of the actors used their natural accents more or less when creating their characters, so that when they were interviewed for the DVD extras, it's sort of like their characters just stepped out of the show to make the comments.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I really like this game a lot! It's addicting! I gave it four stars because you're only allowed 5 lives unless you win and some levels are challenging and takes many more turns and I don't want to have to wait for 10 min. to get a life or 30 for all five, but that may be for the best because I could play all day long if it would let me. If you win that level you move on to the next with however many lives remaining. Also, it won't let me connect to facebook like it says you can. Maybe it's just mine but still would like to since the option is there.
B000SQMLAS|5.0|Absolutely wonderful! The vinyls themselves work fabulously and, for being such an old record and so thick, the cover is in great conduction. The service was great! The content of the album is incomparable to anything else.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The best book I have read in a very long time. It had everything,drama, intrigue, sex, violence, and love. Great book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Unimaginable circumstances bring unimaginable story to life. This was a story of animal husbandry as much as it was a story of unbelievable survival. As far fetched and fanciful a story this was, it truly made you stop and take stock in your own mortality. Could you survive something as devastating as Pi Patel? Would you want to? As a reader, I am glad he forged forward. His desire to survive made for a fascinating read. Gruesome at times, often graphic, the description of life on a life boat with 3 zoo animals had its moments to say the least! All in all I found this to be an interesting read. I especially enjoyed the last chapters; the interview. What I once believed to be facts of his experience, I now questioned. I like that.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|The Quell games have become my new favorite games for my Kindle Fire.  These games are unlike any I have ever played before.  The games start out easy enough but as you proceed they really bend your brain!  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge and something different.
B000056H24|3.0|my mom dont like the way the movie got transfer. she said it was not clear. over all the movie was very good but the material is horrible..
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I bought it for my father as a gift for father's day and have heard no complaints, he uses it everyday.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book was recommended to me by my granddaughter who said<br />it was the best thing she'd read in a long time. it was intelligent and<br />sensitive and handled important topics like illness and death in an<br />appropriate and feelingful way in addition to friendship and romance for<br />young people.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A good author creates a world that you are excited to visit again and again.  That is how I feel about the silo saga.  The first story was interesting, good characters but the location is so captivating, I can't wait to go back and see what else is happening.
145580570X|5.0|Bought this for a friend.  He loved it and I expect to listen to it myself some day.  Thank you!
B007SGM084|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about reading this trilogy of books, however once I started I couldn't put it down. Loved the story and can't wait until the next set is written.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun and easy to play you can use your facebook bingo blitz with this app as well
B009GXHOW4|5.0|this is a very helpfull app for minecraft!!!i was just stranded on a island then i found this app<br />i have full armor a chest full of butter a chest full of iron and a chest full of diamond
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|She really did a great job onthis album  she has a great voice love all the songs some songs make me feel like dancing.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I love how this biography was written as a story. It is so easy to read and understand, just how Jobs would have wanted. Isaacson has outdone himself with this work. It is a must read for every human on this earth. Thank you Steve Jobs for changing the world as many times as you did.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|As a lifelong fan of Thin Lizzy I could not have asked for a better album than what they've released here.  There are plenty of similarities of the various eras of Lizzy in the songs without them plagiarizing themselves too much.  Lyrically the songs are very well penned & I think Phil would be proud.  Ricky Warwick is doing a great job fronting this band.<br />Musically speaking, there is nothing over the top, just that classic quality of guitar smoothness that we all relished as Thin Lizzy fans.  Some favorite tunes would have to be Kingdom of the Lost, Hey Judas, Valley of the Stones & the closer Blues Aint So Bad.  Honestly I tried to find something here to not like & it's just not showing.  A great album from a great legacy that we only hope produces more great music of this ilk in the future.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I've always been a Star Wars fan, and this first episode was not only enjoyable, but an excellent overall movie!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a game that took me awhile to beat. I overall liked it but some of the games are too hard ( sometimes) If you are someone who likes games that have no meaning then this is the one!
B00BMQDM10|5.0|Wedding Night was really good, with the usual humour expected of Sophie Kinsella. Her characters are always so likeable. I enjoyed the book.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Great story of what it feels like to be a child and see the grown up world for all it's evils and realize you can still overcome it.
B005LJITS0|4.0|Sleeper doesn't mean boring.  This movie, along with story line and special effects was put together well but somehow ended up being panned by the critics and public.  I think those people are being much too serious...just sit back and enjoy the entertainment.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie is really fantastic, it's a shame that nobody made a bigger deal about this movie.<br /><br />\\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" is fantastic. The writing is great and the characters are all lovable. This is a movie that is very easy to get lost in. I imagine this become a TBS weekend classic.<br /><br />If you like the premise and you know you like the cast then you will most likely enjoy this movie. The really surprising thing to me is that I feel this movie can become popular beyond its expected audience. The main cast is definitely older, but there is no ready for the audience to follow suit.<br /><br />This movie genuinely made me laugh, and I am sure it will make some viewers cry. The characters all feel genuine and all have a realistic feel to them. Each character is more dynamic than you expect them to be and the problems that each character faces are ageless. If you try to watch this movie I am sure you will not be disappointing.
1600597963|5.0|I do love this book!!  Jamie has done an incredible job writing and organizing this tutorial. As a beginner beader  I am still learning and will use this book and her &#34;Beading with Cabochons&#34;, for years. The only improvement I would have liked to see was more information on the creative process for beading the chain portions of the necklaces.  That said, there is good technical info on attaching and finishing the actual necklace part. There is also info on broaches, working with multiple cabochons, etc.  This is bead embroidery extraordinaire.  Looking closely at Jamie's work examples and designer gallery is such a delight and so inspirational. All in all, this is a must book for working with stones or anything that you would like to bead around.  These books have me addicted.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love this book it is now my favorite book I love this book so much five stars up yes
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Eva and Gideon are finally on the same page but what happens next?<br />I am anxiously waiting for the next book. It better be as good as the first 3.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I am hoping the entire game will be free.  If it is then it should make for an interesting game.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It updates faster than in the past, but I'm not a fan of the new layout. It's harder to find the forecast updates and map views, but I'm sure I'll adapt.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Works really well with kindle fire HD. Great graffix and fun and easy to control. I've just down loaded it and 3 members of the house have downloaded it too.
0385341008|4.0|A delightful read. This was a wonderful historical fiction.<br />I enjoyed it enough to order this copy for my mother :)
B00A77II0U|4.0|This game is worth playing, however unless you become stuck looking for clues you'll be at the credits in about an hour.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I normally don't right reviews for items like this.  It's an external battery, if it works, it's fine.  I have two Anker battery packs, the first one I got was the Anker2 (8400mah), and then later I got the Anker Pro (10000mah).  I bought them in April 2012.  They work, and have worked great in all my vacations/outings since then.  However just recently in July 2013, my 8400mah Anker2 died out on me.  Bummer.  And right before a vacation!<br /><br />I figured I was screwed and would just have to get another battery pack.  However, I thought I would just check on the warranty.  According to the website, 18 months!  Great, I thought.  But it's probably one of those deals where you have to spend 1-2 hours on the phone, ship it off for some lengthy turnaraound repair.  To my surprise, they took care of me right away.  I sent and email, explained I did all due diligence in troubleshooting.  Two days later, I had a replacement and a prepaid label to return the defective one sent to me well in time before my vacation!<br /><br />Thanks, Anker!  That after sales support means everything!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is an awesome book!! Must read. I had a hard time putting it down. I just want to keep reading it. The writer is very imaginative.
140006922X|5.0|Brilliant!  Dr. Aslan mentions that if taken within historical context, the story practically writes itself.  And this quality is reflected in Dr. Aslan's writing, which so easily flows from one event to another.  It's fascinating and I think more dramatic knowing that it's based on fact.  What church tells you the actual story?  And I love it that it takes a Muslim to bring this book to the forefront!  The story is not just about Christianity of course, but Judaism as well.  Decades ago, I took a class in which we read &#34;The Syrian Christ&#34;, which I found fascinating as well.  The description of Jesus was within the context of Middle Eastern overall culture as I recall, which emphasized a glorification of events that may or may not have been totally accurate.  I find the historic reality far more fascinating, and of course believable.   A brilliant book.  Thank you Dr. Aslan.
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|It's fun but you have to buy the rest of the game. And I don't want to pay 4.00  . I give this game 3 stars
1568363931|5.0|I have mixed feelings about how far the Bento \\"enthusiasm\\" has gone.  Some of it is craft sculpture with food.  I don't have kids, but are we really hoping to teach them to play with their food or have to make it so cutsie just to get them to eat it?  :)  However, I have nothing against presentation and garnish of food to make it appealing and the Bento boxes in this cookbook are lovely.  If you want a book with interesting recipe suggestions (not all Japanese) and very light on the \\"cute factor,\\" I think you will enjoy this.  I plan to use my book for inspiration to prepare special box lunches for small groups for picnics and tailgate parties.  In general, this is too \\"fiddly\\" for my lifestyle for taking to work on a daily basis, but I plan to try some of the recipes which sound delicious and pretty healthy.  I've done interesting themes for my picnics and I think folks will enjoy trying a Bento.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fantastic. Bought all the rest right after finishing the first. Hope the movie measures up, but I doubt it will.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Warm Bodies strikes a nice balance between quirkiness, fledgling romance, and light horror/action.<br /><br />Usually when a film tries to be all things to all people it becomes nothing for no one.<br /><br />Warm Bodies takes a few well-worn formulas and slaps them together into a data movie that's satisfying for all parties involved.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I purchased this lantern for outdoor use as well as emergencies, although it's small it is extremely bright, possibly puts out more light than my white gas lanterns. Like other reviews stated it does have some glare but unlike other reviewers the bottom isn't difficult to remove or screw back on, more than likely an operator problem rather than the equipment.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is one of those rare ones that even when twists occur that you don't like,you turn the last page with a sigh of satisfaction. Easy read and will keep you up nights just to finish
0385349947|5.0|great read for women. Good gift to give someone. Highly recommend to anyone who has a wife, friend or female coworker to improve the quality and effectiveness of their career
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I really liked TWC before the updates. Now I find it hard to navigate.  And what is up with the awful backgrounds?  Thinking about deleting.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Is there anything to say that remotely describes this read?  A classic approach with the tortured soul finding true love with enough twists you need a map and compass to navigate.  Not to mention the ridiculously insane lust that's so tantalizing it'll make you slap your grandma.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|What is the point of a seconds long preview of a season past?<br />I don't understand this product.<br />Oh well.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|I loved this book, well written and heart wrenching. Couldn't stop reading it after I started, I definitely recommend it!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Really enjoyed Charlie's quirky, funny and insightful viewpoint. Very entertaining but also thoughtful novel.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|Conan The Barbarian (2011) is a terribly disappointing movie.<br /><br />If this film had not been called Conan The Barbarian, it wouldn't demand comparison the classic 1982 movie, and might not seem so utterly fail-y.<br /><br />If it was not Conan, and just a generic sword-and-sorcery movie, it would still be just as bad, just less disappointing.<br /><br />But really, every cent spent to produce or view this movie is pretty much a waste.<br /><br />I promise I wasn't expecting much, but somehow I still got so much less.<br /><br />To be fair, I LOVE the '82 original, and having watched it recently, it still totally stands the test of time.<br /><br />Conan1982 is often scared, vulnerable, naive, and tender.  Sometimes he wins, sometimes he gets his a$$ beat. He loves, is loved, loses his heart's desire, and is ultimately transformed.  He questions his own place in the world and becomes a greater, more heroic person for it.<br /><br />Conan2011 has no heart.  With the exception of the barbarian equivalent of pulling the rug from under someone, he doesn't learn a thing the entire movie. (Note: he begins the movie at about age 11 or so, so this is super problematic for me.)  There is ZERO arc to him, any other character, or to the story.<br /><br />Also, what the heck was the mask supposed to do anyway?  It never did a thing except look gross and wiggly, like a leprous starfish.  At least in (the not-as-bad-as-Conan2011) Conan the Destroyer, the statue came to life at the end and did something.<br /><br />If you are inclined to watch this, do yourself a favor and watch the original instead.
B004G606K8|5.0|Read this book back in the 80's and have retread it several times since. The Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy is my favorite series I've ever read. Part of that I have no doubt is nostalgia but the story is epic and amazing, and I still retread the series every so many years. These are the books that made me a lifetime reader as a young teen.
B001I45UFC|5.0|What a joy to revisit and re-read time and again! C.S. Lewis creates a wonderful world of imagination for children to enter into and explore
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the earlier version. This one looks fancy but is much harder to get the info you want.  Radar maps are not good anymore.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This is by far the best Mission Impossible movie that I have seen yet! I was hesitant about watching it at first because it's a 2-hour movie. But, time flew by. Definitely a movie worth watching.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The charger works as advertised, and is very small and doesn't get in the way.<br />I've used it for about two weeks now, no issues have come up.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is better than what I have been using.  Hourly information and accurate radar maps very helpful  on rainy days for dog walking.<br />,

B008XGW1CI|2.0|Akin to the stereotype (or perhaps reality) that says that child actors have to take some grown-up rolls to stop being seen as children, Rowling confessed that with this novel she aimed to demonstrate that she can write books for adults. Unfortunately, this is so over the top as to be equivalent to Emma Watson becoming a hardcore porn star to prove that she's a big girl now. This book is so dreadfully overdone it's difficult to read. Character after character is one-dimensional and completely self-deluded. Yes, I know all humans are flawed and that we all have faults that could be put under a microscope. Rowling seems to believe that every single person is nothing but flaws utterly without redeeming characteristics. If she intended this effect, this is a terribly cynical and simplistic novel; if she instead intended to provide some positive character traits and complex personalities then she failed miserably and the book was poorly written. Either way, characters this uniformly bad and, well, uniform, cannot amount to a good story.<br /><br />The title would imply that the driving force behind the plot, were there to be one, is the \\"casual vacancy\\" for town office. No such plot line ever develops. There are characters who seek to fill this vacancy, but, with one exception, their actions never drive the story or effect any other characters. A man wants to fill the vacancy, his wife doesn't want him to, people in town gossip about his fitness, nothing comes of any of this - how is that a plot? A good person moves into town and actually tries to change things for the better, really putting her heart into things that have been ignored for too long, and things go more horribly than you could ever have imagined - what is the point? As far as I can tell this book is designed to very forcefully assert that miserable people will live miserable lives, doing miserable things and everyone will inevitably end up miserable. There is no redemption of any kind. There is no hidden undercurrent of hope. Things just keep getting more miserable until you are incredibly relieved that it's over. Shocked at how carried away she got making the point that she's an adult author now, but relieved to be finished nonetheless.<br /><br />Rowling has simply tried way, way too hard to prove that she's willing to tackle adult issues and be tough as nails. Unfortunately, she's also proven that her judgement as an author is lousy and maybe she's better off sticking to telling constructed, plot-driven stories, then on delving into drama. I gave this book two stars only because she can still string a sentence together and there are worse authors out there. But I could not recommend investing your time in reading this book.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|This movie is so real! It deals with the real and raw issues of drug use, bisexuality and aids. This movie clearly gets the message across that even supermodels are not superhuman! If they do not care for themselves, they can perish as quickly as anyone else!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I PLAY THIS GAME EVERY WEEK AND LIKE THE TOURNAMENTS. I BEAT MY FB FRIENDS PRETTY MUCH ANY TIME I PLAY :) ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS RUNNING OUT OF LIVES
B005NFVZTM|3.0|You know, the Cuban Missile Crisis was an actual event in world history--perhaps the closest we've ever come to completely destroying ourselves.  There were also real people involved in averting this catastrophe.  To put things in perspective, what if 60 years from now someone made a film about evil bug people blowing up the World Trade Center?  And then, they thought it would be cool to have Batman or Robocop hunt down Osama bin Laden?  If you were an American and lived through that experience, wouldn't you find it in terribly poor taste and maybe a bit offensive?<br />I guess after enough time goes by even the possible annihilation of the human race makes for a fun movie.  I wonder if the world is ready for a sitcom about Hiroshima.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I look to the weather channel for the most complete weather information, and it has yet to fail. Oh, agreed it rains when it isn't supposed to, but since I live in western Washington, that is a constant. Accurate, informative, and even a bit of fun tossed in. I very much enjoy the videos, especially of upcoming programs like &quot;Brink&quot;. A very good app. Also great for mapping users.
B00008EY65|5.0|I love this movie! it was bought as a gift and the person I bought it for loves it too.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I usually never read these kind of books.  I'm a romance reader at heart. The story was told In such a life like manner that you could Almost put yourself back in time.  The author did a wonderful job.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Famous line that fits this as I have been blinded by the entertainment brilliance that is criminal minds! This is one of my favorite shows and it has the perfect blend of well rounded characters, actors/actresses, writers, etc. It's a very successful combination! I own many episodes and love them all.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was a great book .It is a great pert  when there house flooded!!!!!<br />How long did it take to make the book
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Read in two days! Couldn't put it down!<br />Recommend this book! Loved the ending, didn't see that coming!<br />Kept me wondering til Jamaica.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Diary of a wimpy kid (Roddick rules) is boss and awesome! I would read all of the diary of a wimpy kid books.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Worth the watch. Enjoyable. I didn't get to see the first movie, so I will be looking for it to show up on Prime.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome and fun app. Its challenging for me but not so hard that my boys cant figure it out and play. They love that the rooms can be reset so they can both figure out the puzzle. It makes us all use our brains and think outside the box. cant wait to play more.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Totally love it but wish you didn't have to use tokens to play you run out too quick.<br />If a game says free it should really be free. Other then th a t it's a great game.<br />Love love love love !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000GCFG7E|4.0|A good read but a little slow in places so only four stars, but still a good story with a twist or two.
B0094M2ITG|5.0|This is a tale about tale-telling. Or about the relationship between fathers and sons. It is also about whether you wish to see your existence in tedious reality or a more embellished, romantic form. Bravery, honesty, and connection will make you cry, especially in the closing segment reminding me of Lori McKenna's words in &#34;Paper Wings and Halo&#34;, &#34;if she could get out of that damn chair&#34;.
0316227706|5.0|I bought this for my Dad for Father's Day and I read it at least 4 times before giving it to him... almost didn't want to in the end! For anyone who has or has had a dog this is a MUST.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|IT IS SO EPIC. I said that because of the realistic graphics. Thanks for the game! And people who rate the game 1 star are just trolls
B002SSBD6W|4.0|A well balanced read with great insight, although it was tough to read the animal cruelty parts.<br /> We need to be more aware of factory farming and this book did a good job shedding light on this despicable issue.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I saw the movie first and them read the book. The book was really worth reading even after watching the movie. This was the first book I got to read for pleasure after college and I'm glad I chose it. This book can be enjoyed by anyone.
B00BURWSHA|5.0|Just great...Love it. Rock the way it is suppose to be. Good grooves and a ballad that in a past time would of hit #1
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|I LOVED IT WELL BECAUSE I AM A FAN I WAS A FAN SINCE I WAS BORN THE MOVIE WAS AWESOME
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|i absolutely love this cd its great i especially love the  song i think im in love again with gloria estfan she's fabulous!!
0143116738|4.0|Ken Robinson has outlined one's potential for growth and development-by reading this insightful book, I look forward to finding &#34;my element.&#34;
B0055J7F40|5.0|You have to have a sense of humor and open mind to allow for the craziness involved in this film. Super religious people would easily be offended by some of the content ~ so don't see it if you do not want to be offended. After all, not everyone can be pleased. I like the unrated version that showed some additional scenes that just pulled some extras together, but did not impact the overall story plot.<br />Aliens are not my favorite movie genre to watch, but this one has become my favorite. Probably because of the quick-wit, sarcasm.<br />Simply one of my favorite movies! :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such an adorable game!We just got it and love it already. The minions are so cute! So very glad we got this game.
0345529057|5.0|Received books in great condition and in a timely manner.  Will order further books in the future!  Price for whole set was very affordable and a great deal!
B0076794IO|5.0|I did not buy this book through Amazon, but at the Supermarket. And it was good. Choose it based on the blurb. Have been very careful in buying books from previously unread authors, as the cost of books and my budget almost make them a luxury. i did not regret this purchase. Finished it last night. Despite dozing off...tired. It was an excellent read. Riveting and suspenseful. Will research and read other books by this author, hope they will be as good as this one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wasn't really expecting to like this series bought it solely based on all the hype before I read I tried watching the movie and couldn't do it lol once I started reading I couldn't stop but I had really hoped for a happier ending but still five stars
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is truly a book that you can relate to your life and feel better about everything in your life because you read it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game.  My son is always fighting over my phone to play this game.  Great way to pass time when I am waiting to pick up the kids in the parking lot.  Puzzles are short and quick so that I can stop the game when it's time to go.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|this is the best game on here now. I like it because I don't have to go on fb every day now and slow down my computer.so this game is good for my tablet
B001HM1PFO|5.0|I first saw this at a midnight movie in Dallas.  It never failes to amuse! A classic Campy Movie about a very un uptight visitor from<br />Transexeual Transilvania.  Horror movie?  Horribly delicious and a hilarious spoof of the old horror movies.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|I happen to be a Depp fan and this one is no exception.  Wonderful animation and a very good story line.  For adults and kids.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Similar to other matching mahjong games, except you never lose in this one.  The tiles always reshuffles when you run out of moves so that you can solve the puzzle every time.  Not very challenging.
B001N26GFM|5.0|After studying about the Holocaust, one of my students recommended this movie.  Although, it is sad to think about this time in history, this movie shows clearly how people were affected by it.  It is an awesome movie.  One I will show in my classroom over and over.  Thanks to Amazon for offering it to me.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|It is certainly about time that Joe put out a CD worthy of his reputation. This is a great CD that brings back the Joe we all came to enjoy. The songs continue to flow as they take you from soulful rhythms to ballads as only Joe can do them. The producers and writers took their time and came up with a great CD.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Doomed from the moment this plot attempted to reflect, in any way or to any degree, the original 'Wizard'. I very much enjoy and respect James Franco as an actor.... but NOT in this roll. I can't really recommend this flick on any level. I can only be grateful that I didn't pay full price to see it at my local theatre.
B0063M22QO|5.0|My daughter and I are having great fun with this app. Love the tile designs, the music and sound effects.  Also enjoying the different modes of the game. It's relaxing and well worth the $0.99.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's pretty much TEMPLE RUN, but is Despicable Me themed. It is still fun. It is pretty much a time waster
B00DU74U74|4.0|Prior to the movie I read the book, The Host, and loved it. The movie certainly shortens the plot and story line but overall is a decent interpretation of the novel. Worth watching.
B00CJGP116|5.0|The King of Salsa is back!  Its been a very long time since Marc came out with some original salsa and he and  Sergio George haven't lost a step! Granted this is no where near the masterpiece that was the Contra la Corriente album.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|i simply loved the book, and the one thing i got out of it was the way this man used his brain, thats what made him a genius.
0143039431|5.0|John Steinbeck is a master story teller.  This is the first time I read it but I know I will read it again and again.<br />Joan
B0049J2BSM|5.0|cute move I loved it, can't wait to see the sequel clean, no cursing and no violence, refreshing change of pace and I don't have any kids, I watched it for me.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|IT IS AMAZING THAT FROM JOSH GROBAN'S FIRST ALBUM THROUGH TO THE MOST RECENT RELEASE HIS VOICE JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER. TOO BAD HE CAN'T RECORD A NEW ALBUM EACH MONTH.
B00846REIS|2.0|Not the hot love story I hoped it be. I can relate to some unusual sex hunger and lust but this was ridiculous. Just when I thought the actual story would get better, it got worse. No surprise. No excitement. No page turner. I'm hoping the next book is better. But I'm not holding my breath.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|This is a great app but the problem is that it is probably broken. I can't watch any videos now. It says vtube has stopped or goes to a black screen. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. I am getting bored.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is one of those moves you don't expect to be good but after you watch it you feel dumb for waiting to long to see it.  Very good.
030789701X|5.0|The book has everything you nerd to know. Even the DLC to the game. It is great to see what you have missed.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|fun for the first couple levels then i got bored of it.  didnt get any different really just searching for things in the same way level after level.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|When I first played this game I addicted to this game. It is advertising because my little cousins,Kenny and Mae love to watch. Want to hear something funny about my cousins? Ok,when ever they hear the music they dance. :)
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Daft Punk has revolutionized Electronic Dance Music (EDM) once again across the world. This is the perfect blend of old school disco and new future sounds of electronic music. If you are looking for a new favorite album, this is it, no matter what your musical taste or age.
1401233791|4.0|great story and writing, the early 90's artwork seems a little boring when reading it for the first time in 2013, but still a great graphic novel.  can't wait to read Volume 2!!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|this game is fun and addicting but hard to keep playing. you get very little coins for passing a level and it charges for everything to continue playing. fun but i wish it were easier to play as much as i wanted.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is such a fun and challenging game that,really,makes you think outside the box i want,to,get,the full version so,i can keep enjoying,this awesome game
B003RNXIBK|5.0|After the early albums and LPs Eminem put out, and his spiral down into the pit of drugs, this is probably one of the best albums he has ever created. He has been and will always be my favorite artist.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is fun but the energy runs out faster than you can earn it so the game ends unless you buy energy. You have to exit and come back later. It is very addictive to play.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I know most people would consider me as a game freak but once my friend introduced it to me . When I first  played it I played it all night and day!! I hope the creators make more games similar to this.
1781162646|5.0|I am a Stephen King fan and own all of his books.  I first purchased the book in italian because there was no indication it wasn't in english but now I haven the book I wanted.
B005HF0GMA|5.0|What a fine ensemble cast. A truly believable family made the supernatural part of the story so much more enjoyable.<br />I intend to watch all the episodes because I think I missed quite a few...it never seemed to be on at the same time, or there was a sports broadcast instead.
B007U1FEJE|3.0|great title track. three other good two minute songs. otherwise mediocre. okay for fans, but this isn't Summer Days (and Summer Nights !). Any of Brian's solo recordings (to date) are better than this.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Beautifully written  work evoking the struggle of life and love against the power of evil within North Korea.  Watch for the shout-out to a well-loved movie on the same subject, different evil regime.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The only problem is that you do not have red stone, and you can not make things explode. You can place TNT but you can't ignite it. Even when pouring lava all over it lol<br /><br />I understand that there are limitations on tablets and phones, but it would be nice to blow stuff up and create machines on the go.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game alot because it is similar to temple run. And I love temple run. This game different because instead of evil demon monkeys chasing you, a security guard and his dog are chasing you, and there are different level ups than temple run.
0316056898|5.0|She is one of the funniest and most delightful women you will ever read!  If you want some workplace advice, 30-Rock behind-the-scene tales, and to fall out of your hammock laughing (yeah, I did that), then pick up this gem.
B00CBKLO52|2.0|Works well on the PC, but unless you have a blue tooth controller it is hard to have fun with this.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Well-written, acted, and produced -- I enjoyed this movie greatly.  Recommended for all who love a great storyline accomplished with grace and humor.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Awesome platformer for Android. Easy to pick up and play through, but still has some challenges to get all the different items.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun puzzle game.  hope there is more levels free.........,..........................  good thinking game.  makes you think...  I will rate it a 4
B006AZZPCM|5.0|We do not have fast internet, so this is perfect for the kids (and myself). The ads are annoying, but considering that your breaching Google's terms and conditions....
B00BB22GQM|4.0|I SAW THESE FELLAS ON T.V. AND DECIDED I WANTED TO OWN ONE OF THEIR CDS.  THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT.  I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN BUT I HAVE A WIDE INTEREST IN MUSIC.
B009PMB3CI|3.0|Though my 6yo son really liked the cute puppy, he quickly got board. The mini-games are clunky and not fun at all. The dancing game is not refined and needs a lot of work. I bought this hoping my son would have a virtual pet to play with but now it is unused.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Totally messed up and crazy. Loved it and want more. I felt like it stopped abruptly but probably because I just wanted to keep reading this story
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I love Khaled Hosseini.  Or at least I try to love his writing.  I'm sad to say that after his last book, I now only like his writing style.  He's got fantastic the stories to tell.  This book, however, was too disjointed.  I kept re-reviewing to be sure I had the right person in mind.  That being said, the story(ies) in this book are genuinely good, and you want to know more.  Sad, of course, but good.  Definitely worth reading, but still doesn't stand up against The Kite Runner.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The horses are awsome good i love the tournaments . The game ive been dreaming/waiting for . I love it
B0094WK9GU|5.0|These guys are in the top 10% of Remix  DJs in the world.  If you're into dance/hi-energy music, you'll love this mp3
B008AIGWVA|1.0|My son (4) hated it. He used it once and it made him cry. All of you should just stop making apps.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Was so excited to own this.  It arrived early and was exactly what I wanted.  Can't wait to watch it over and over again.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is a really good game but they should give you the full version for free because most people don't want to spend money on full version
B0043X1FL8|1.0|When I got to the end of the movie it would not play at all. I was very disappointed It was my first purchase from Amazon
B007ZXK08C|1.0|The &#34;diary&#34; style was not my cup of tea at all, and the characters seemed to have little by way of redeeming features.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good memory exercise. Gets progressively more challenging and uses a variety of puzzle types. Great for game play in limited time frames.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game Is challenging but easy at the same time! It's a great game! I recommend it for anyone! It never gets boring! :D
B003O86FMW|4.0|A great follow-up to the first book, a tad predictable at times but nonetheless, I couldn't put this book down!  A great summer read, fast-paced, and intriguing. Can't wait to read number three!
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|Paul has written an interesting book on how important character is to success and brought up a lot of the current educational efforts that take this into account. I wish there was more science involved in the narrative but overall am interesting read.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|So I guess it's good that it's a trilogy then, huh? Good read, great for the summer. Concept is dark and at times, can be a real bummer...but overall, if you are looking for a  fast-paced and thought-provoking read, this is what you want.
B009MXSWI8|4.0|The movie was highly rated as a classic comedy horror/scifi and it was. At times is was pretty dumb, but that was part of its charm.
B0048EANOW|5.0|It's great to be able to get the films you love at such a terrific price.  As for the film itself, it's even better than the novel, which is saying a lot.  The entire evil Walt Disney main plot was removed, you'll never miss it, and the prison train hijacking, which would have been fun but you don't need it.  There are actually 3 male leading roles in this sun-drenched classic noir, they are all riveting  And I was shocked by Kim Basinger; I did not think she was capable of this level of performance.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its just fun and it is not to hard  .It is Very relaxing.  Graphics are great. The  sound is very funny.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great Fun game, challenging at times, I would recommend this game to friends, keeps you thinking, fun game try it
B008MM9630|5.0|By far my favourite of all the farming games and apps that i have tried, and I LOVE the magickal/fairy theme!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I super duper love it! My son loves it and it is so entertaining for the whole family! I also downloaded the angry birds star wars too. We are so thankful that it's a free game!
0307476073|5.0|I couldn't put Strayed's book down, even though some of her choices pre-trail made me sad.  But Strayed isn't easy on herself.  I like the invention of her symbolic new last name, and the fact that she admits to liking Michener even though the English professor snobs she studied with put him down.  I liked her voice and her perseverence and, of course, her bravery in taking off to hike the trail by herself.  She shows the healing power of nature and of challenging yourself to do something you never thought you could.
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|I love duets and old songs!  One of my new favorites!  Love all the arrangements!  Received this and 2 other cds very quickly.
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|This app doesn't work! I dont know what the hell these other great reviews are talking about!? I cant even egging log in, because its stupid right now. Just don't waste your time downloading thia app, it does nothing if it wont allow u to log in.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Beautiful arrangements!  Michael knows how to pick good old songs to redo.  One of my new favorites to play constantly!
B004L9MFM2|5.0|I have to read the next one and the next one. I have become so involved with the characters & somehow I do not find it difficult to keep track of the names .
B0092ZEIN4|4.0|I t does exactly what it is supposed to do and very well have yet to find a game or emulator it doesn't work well with, the only thing is the phone stand does not attach to the pad I thought it did, oh well works great otherwise
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It was funny fun and addictive the one thing I may complain about is that the.battles are hard it is one of the best games I have played totally recommend it yes thankfully it.was free love it
B000HF0J36|4.0|If you love horror movies that toe the line between a B-movie and an almost serious film, and also happen to have a sincere fear of sharks, then &#34;Deep Blue Sea&#34; is right up your alley.
030758836X|3.0|I'm going back and forth on my opinion of this book and I might be under too much influence of her other two novels to really give an unbiased opinion. I really enjoyed the other books but GONE GIRL was strange for me. None of the characters were likable and I wasn't sure who to root for. That's okay but it left me feeling really down. What I did like about it was that you couldn't trust the narrator and I found that to be a good plot device. Usually the narrator is at least trustworthy when it comes to their own inner thoughts but in this case you couldn't be sure what was true and what wasn't, especially when Amy's diary came into play. I'll probably give her future novels a read, too. I really enjoy her writing style and the nuances she gives her characters, even if I don't particularly like them.
1451695195|2.0|Though I believe in Heaven, this book did nothing to \\"prove\\" that Heaven exists.  Mr. Alexander comes across as a very pompous man, describing what he has to say \\"as important as anything anyone will ever tell you\\".  Really?  More important that Jesus, Gandhi or Buddha had to say?  What he tells us is that he was in a coma for a week and had a vision of Heaven during that time.  His proof that the vision was real and not a hallucination or a dream is that the vision was very clear.  That is really it.  He describes a female guide in Heaven who he remembers to the finest detail.  But when he sees a picture of her on earth, he doesn't recognize her at first, but later decides that the picture is of his female guide.  How much detail does he really remember?  Truly, one of the most arrogant pieces of writing I have every read.  The only redeeming value of this book is that Mr. Alexander's blow by blow of his illness, from a doctor's point of view, was pretty interesting.  He would have done better to simply tell us what he remembers and let the reader decide on the value of his story.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Very good way to receive instruction. Even entertaining. Give a try. Beats all the knot books I have purchased.<br />Fair winds!
B001QJUX24|5.0|never been a John Wayne fan, but this film was a required film that I had to watch. it was good, and I enjoyed it
B005GIS23I|4.0|Just make sure your in the mood for a stupid funny kind of movie. Entertaining and enjoyable to watch. Thanks
B00003CY6M|5.0|I think this is one of John Cusacks best work...He's a funny, and now I've seen quite serious, actor.  Picked this little gem up because my gf stated it was one of the 50 all time greatest chick flicks...
B00D4ABW82|4.0|I wasn't sure how well this album would fare amongst the die hard fans, compared to To Plant a Seed and Understanding What We've Grown to Be. Being from my home State/town, I was instantly drawn to WCAR, but found their early work to be premature.  Personally, I thought the tracks on To Plant a Seed all sounded too similar. Understanding focused a little more on better hooks and arrangements but still lacked a softer delivery. Not every track has to be a punch in the throat. I think they really nailed it with Tracing Back Roots. WCAR aren't relying on that constant double bass pedal and palm muted guitar work on every track. Songs like \\"I Survive\\" even have this amazing melodic vocal provided by Alex and then the chorus kicks in with David's signature growl. It seems they're starting to rearrange their formula, much like Linkin Parked learned to do, which is only making their songs stronger and more memorable! The hooks are stronger as well, easily getting stuck in your head throughout the day between listens. I like how David has raised the octaves for a majority of his vocal parts on this album. It may seem disappointing to some but it really has a greater impact than the low growl he used profusely on the previous records. He and Alex's vocal contrast works really well and transitions pretty smoothly as they exchange lyrics. Overall, I'm thrilled with this record and haven't stopped listening to it. Some highlight songs are:<br /><br />Fade Away<br />I Survive<br />Never Let Me Go<br />Hope (radio hit, great hook though!)<br />Tell Me Now<br />A Moment<br />I Am Free<br />Through the Darkest Dark and Brightest Bright
0439023513|1.0|I have to admit, I loved the first two books, particularly the second book. But this last book was just ... a word I still can't put a finger on.<br /><br />My brother recommended I read the series. He told me the second book was great, full of action, and the last book was \\"just crazy.\\" Didn't know what he meant.<br />While reading the last book, and after I got 3/4 of the way, I realized it was better than I thought. I thought \\"just crazy\\" meant half the characters getting killed, and perhaps that's why I felt relief while reading it (because everyone was alive until then). Even Peeta got back. Not in his right mind, but I had hope of his recovery.<br /><br />When I got to the ending, I realized the last two chapters were the worst part. I knew Katniss was breaking down and having trouble dealing with the situation -- it's only natural, or realistic, that she does. But her burning in the end just completely deteriorates her personality - her strength. Then killing Coin?? I didn't see that one coming.<br />And that brings me to all the questions with what happened in the book. Was Snow telling her the truth? Along with Boggs? Boggs told her not to trust anyone, to go on with her mission, and to kill Peeta. Why kill Peeta?? He was recovering - becoming conscious of his own danger. And he didn't hurt anyone yet, not to mention all the guards around him. He was trying to recover as much as he could. So WHY would Boggs want her to kill him? And not trust the others? Why? Aren't they all trying to bring down the Capitol? I get that Coin would want her killed, but she could make a choice to remain neutral when the president is chosen. I'm sure by the end of the book she understands that Haymitch had a point at the end of the second book when he told her something along the lines of that's why no one let's you do the planning.<br /><br />So was Boggs good or not? He definitely helped Snow get to her. And was Snow telling the truth? Or was he just playing with her? To me,it's the latter. But there's no way of knowing. Her shooting Coin adds to the fact that she went insane in the end. Especially seeing Prim dying - which was so unexpected and quick.<br /><br />Also, why the pointless mission? Going forward and having all those people - including Finnick - die along the way for NOTHING. By the time they got to the mansion the rebels had won. Also, Snow knew she and her \\"crew\\" were in the city. He'd know she's coming for him. But when she heard the president is opening his mansion to accept refugees, she and the others literally didn't think that he'd expect them going?? And at the end... for no reason. She didn't catch Snow, didn't speed up winning the war. Nothing. It was completely pointless.... and all I could think of after Prim died and she got burnt was ... what a waste.<br /><br />Like others have said, everything that happened was too unexpected and quick. The only thing that really lingers is the fact that Katniss is so emotionally detached and irrational. Which I can understand. Having to survive all by yourself when you're only 12 years old, and take care of an incapable mother and young sister would result in someone who's detached. Keeping her guard up to protect herself from getting hurt. Makes sense. But that should also add a hint of intelligence, not absolute irrationality. Which is why she's also so impulsive and also can't distinguish between her feelings for Peeta and Gale.<br />Perhaps this is exactly what SC wanted her to be. But it's TOO emotionally detached. I mean, after all they've been through and her feeling that \\"thing\\" again, she can't even tell Peeta she loves him? The only thing she manages to get out is \\"Real.\\"<br />It definitely adds to the lack of satisfaction in the end. And as others have said, we didn't need a happy ending. We needed closure. With words. Knowing Peeta got what he deserved, that Katniss is now more than just a vegetable. Her realizing that Peeta deserves a lot more than just \\"real.\\" Maybe she does, because she has his children, which he \\"badly wanted,\\" but that's far from satisfying. It's too vague.<br /><br />I get authors sometimes make miserable endings to keep their readers thinking about the book, but this was just ... ridiculous, to a degree. It does feel that she just needed to wrap up the book. And there's still my unanswered questions about Snow, Boggs and Coin. Coin did leave killing Snow to Katniss after all. And she kept her end of the bargain with Enobaria and the rest. Even though she could've made their deaths an accident or not rescued Enobaria at all if she wanted. I'm not defending Coin, but again Katniss was too impulsive with killing her. As Haymitch told her, who's the real enemy? Not the districts... The Capitol. And thus Snow.<br /><br />I don't know what to make out of this book. I was obsessed with the series and LOVED the first two books. But the wrap-up of the third book was just O.O Not in a good way. SC could've made up for everything in the middle of the book if there was closure in the end. But there wasn't, which great detracts from the book and the story's value, in my opinion.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I usually give up on these types of games. Playing &quot;Can You Escape&quot; has made me decide to give it another chance. Perfect game to pass the time.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This is a short story worth investigating. This was perfect reading between longer texts. It moves quickly to develop two main characters. Although the title suggests The Emperor is the focus, it is the character's experience of the project, insights into human motivations and ultimately true artistry that are the pearls. The ending provides closure with possibilities. I could see a trilogy of short books coming from this foundation but I do not know whether that was ever intended.
1594487154|5.0|It is not very often that a book gets rave reviews as a gift. This one did. In fact when I asked if I could borrow it the answer was a flat no... get your own!
B004RKXN44|5.0|A world war is building between the Psy (a race of people void of emotion) and the Changelings (packs of sentimental shape-shifters: wolves, cats, hawks, rats, creatures of the sea, etc).<br /><br />The Psy torture their children to destroy every whisper of feeling, for they believe it's a weakness. They want a silent world, under their control. The Changelings won't have it.<br /><br />There are mini-battles throughout all the books and you can smell the cold fire thickening the air. The character cast so massive and the intricacies in the plot so complex, Singh could spend the rest of her career on just this series (please don't--your Guild Hunter series is one of my favs).<br /><br />Sci-fi and paranormal on the cutting edge, each book is a dark yet erotic portrait of the varying personalities in this supernatural world. Evocatively, stylistically, and sensually captivating, this unique futuristic series of fairy tales works on every level. The sex scenes are pure magic.<br /><br />This review applies to the first eleven books in the series (all of which I've given 5 stars). Kiss of Snow (#10) is my favorite.<br /><br />Slave to Sensation<br />Visions of Heat<br />Caressed by Ice<br />Mine to Possess<br />Hostage to Pleasure<br />Branded by Fire<br />Blaze of Memory<br />Bonds of Justice<br />Play of Passion<br />Kiss of Snow<br />Tangle of Need
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This is a great movie. I loved it and bought it. I've watched it twice since getting it. Can't wait for the weekend to watch it with friends.
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|Nothing much happened, and the ending was flat. It was very easy to put down and I was nearly at the end of the book and it still took me days to bother reading the ending.

B00AEBEQW8|5.0|This is one of the most original children's books out there.  I purchased it for my 4 year old daughter  my 9 year old was so entranced he read to her multiple times. Highly recommended.
B0081KZ20E|5.0|The Day of the Jackal, by Frederick Forsyth, stunned me at the end with its resonance.<br /><br />I began reading this novel after Sol Stein recommended it in his book Stein on Writing as an example of structuring a story for suspense.<br /><br />At first, I was a bit confused because so many of the \\"rules\\" of writing were violated. A great deal of narrative summary padded the beginning of the book and many uses of the passive voice existed.<br /><br />What made Forsyth's tale a modern classic and basis for popular movie versions?<br /><br />I wasn't blown away, but the story and the historical references interested me. So I continued listening to the audio book.<br /><br />Enter the Jackal. At first, this character seemed like a modern anti-hero like so many assassins portrayed as good guys in movies. Forsyth showed him as a skilled professional not to be messed with. When an identity forger tries to double cross him, the Jackal ruthlessly takes him out.<br /><br />A gunsmith treats the Jackal honestly, and the Jackal spares his life. Not every character is so lucky. Let's just say that at a certain point, I thoroughly turned against the Jackal and wanted him to go down hard for his crimes.<br /><br />Police Inspector Claude Labelle is introduced well in to the story, but quickly becomes a major character. By the end of the novel, I'm cheering him on and growling at everyone who seeks to destroy his reputation.<br /><br />The Day of the Jackal entertains from start to finish, though I found the second half of the book exceptionally good. This is a novel I will read again for enjoyment, but will also study as an example of good writing.<br /><br />Simon Preble performed the audio book. He's one of the best readers I have listened to, and I devour audio books one after another.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I REALLY do not like the updated version. I am going to delete it from my kindle. I don't care for the reward points which I turned off. I don't need an &quot; alert&quot; to tell me the temperture. I prefer the old version.

B000002KFJ|5.0|Recently with the re-emergence of Sabbath, I purchased Sabotage. Back in the '70's I had all of the albums up to &#34;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&#34;. In my opinion this release was one step further in the bands evolution. Pleased with my purchase.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The way the graphics smoothley work and the Challenges made just to keep playing is good(: . Also when Connecting to Facebook to see other friends high score just makes players want to play more and more. I think although the game is Good and addicting they should add more Characters such as The dad, the three little girls and more Characters off the Movie.

It was uneven and varying which left me with a 1 lb letter opener so I sent it back for a replacement. Long story short the second knife trully lived up to the hype. I would order this again and hope that that first knife was an anomaly.

B00CRS88IO|5.0|As a writer myself, I have to be completely honest here.<br />Wow!  For those of you who grew up with Ian Fleming, you have to appreciate what the author has accomplished here.<br />Not only did the author catch my full attention, and hold it, all the way through. He also captured the same compassion and attention even to the smallest little detail, just like Ian Fleming did.<br />Normally, I don't like it when someone messes with a proven performer from my youth. They seldom change the story line around. Either to fit their own ideas or perhaps to make it appear politically correct. What ever their reasons, I don't like it or appreciate it.<br /><br />But this story is different. This story is unique and fresh. And yet, it portrays exactly what we've come to expect from Ian Fleming and /or the character of James Bond. And while the character of James Bond doesn't even make an appearance. You quickly realize that Commander Fleming is what we've come to love about James Bond. The action, the intrigue,and even the women. You had to know that there would be some really good looking ladies, didn't you.<br /><br />And the author Damian Stevenson, doesn't disappoint anyone. I gave this book five stars because it deserves ten stars. The characters and their attitudes, are flawless. Ian Fleming himself, would enjoy this book.Well done Mr. Stevenson. Well done indeed!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I dont even remember when exactly i downloaded this game but im a high level and the game is still fun and appears to continue being enjoyable!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have used the Weather Channel app since I got my Kindle Fire in 2011. It worked great and was easy, but they updated it and completely changed it, now it's not user friendly at all, very difficult to use. I am downloading another weather app to use instead. They should have left it alone, you know if it's not broke don't fix it.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|I recall very well when back in '73 this album came out.  I enjoyed it then and I enjoy now.  However this edition has gone well beyond expectations.  Disc 2,3 & 4 is quite a bonus.  I have found myself listening intently to disc 2 because it is rehearsals and outtakes.  Quite a grouping of really great stuff.  Any ABB fan would love it but more importantly musicians should buy this because of the bonus if for no other reason.  It's all good!!  John Martin

Stu Block does an AMAZING JOB on vocals!  And the BAND are at TOP NOTCH PERFORMANCE...Even the crowds chanting etc, get you into it EVEN MORE.... BY FAR...

B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|.This was a really fun twist on a classic &quot;jewel&quot; game.  I really enjoyed an almost role-playing feel to this game.  I will definitely get more of this type of game.

B008AK8FHM|2.0|As I read I was progressively more troubled by the author's strong claims so went to the web for some background.  I found an article in Esquire that rather confirmed my feelings that the story involved here is larger and more complex than what the book covers.  I stopped reading the book.
142312166X|3.0|The book was okay but far from the best of the series/collection. As an annex, it does fill in a few missing blanks of the 5 book series but you can get a long without it too.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|A woman discovers she is a clone by accidentally meeting one of her dopplegangers, just before the latter commits suicide by jumping in front of a train.  Grabbing the purse left by the doppleganger, the woman adopts her career, which happens to be that of a policewoman!<br /><br />It gets more complicated from here, as several more clones emerge.  And who is trying to kill them all?<br /><br />A tour-de-force performance by the lead actress who adopts all of the clone roles.  She manages to look the same in all of them, yet she has different mannerisms, voice, accent, movements, and so on, which makes them all unique.  If you like good acting, this alone is reason to see this fast-paced thriller.<br /><br />Good job you can pause and even rewind, as I needed to pause and rethink from time to time to keep everything straight.<br /><br />At the end of the last episode, it seems as if there is room for a second season.  I've no idea if this is happening.

B009TZBEKW|4.0|I have really been impressed by the work DJ/producer Calvin Harris has been able to release.  Some DJs or producers like to ride on the coattails of the primary artist's talent and grab a song credit for themselves, as well (Diddy has made a career of that).  Others, like Harris, are full collaborative partners with their featured artists, and the higher quality of those endeavors shines through.<br /><br />  On \\"18 Months\\", Harris is able to showcase his collaborations with well known artists like Rihanna, Florence and the Machine, and Ellie Goulding which have already become big hits in their own right.  He also shows his own vocal talents in \\"Feel So Close\\".  \\"18 Months\\" also gives lesser known singers, like Tinie Tempah and Ayah Marar, a chance to improve their visibility with Harris' help.<br /><br />  I think Harris is going to be a big player in the game for many years to come and I'm looking forward to his follow-ups to \\"18 Months\\"
B007SGM084|5.0|I originally bought this trilogy in print form then purchased it in on my Kindle Fire.  Its been a real page turner, keeping me up waaaay past my bedtime. I love how the characters develop and how the story unfolds. I am currently over half way done with the last book and I'm not sure what I'll read next when I'm done. I am also sold on purchasing and reading more books on my Kindle. I already have magazine subscriptions on my Kindle. The portability of having reading materials easily available for my reading pleasure is great. No worries about pages being wrinkled, book mark falling out and losing my place, etc. I recommend this trilogy to anyone who wants exciting, lighthearted, sensual reading content...especially those who can function with a little less sleep ;).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good luck! Once you start you can't stop. You just keep playing and playing. Plus I just love the stinkin minions the are so darn cute!

0345529057|4.0|The paperback box set of the first four books was a great value. I got the set because I couldn't wait to see what might happen on the upcoming 4th season of Game of Thrones. I will definitely be going back to read the other previous 2 volumes. Once I started reading I couldn't stop. The way George weaved the characters stories together was mesmerizing and the twists kept me on my toes.  There was some differences in the show and the book which I like to discover too.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|Reminiscent of White Oleander with a bit of Where the Heart Is<br />The Language of Flowers had a lot more depth to the story than just the relationship that orphan Victoria and her love for flowers and the meaning behind them. Victoria has just turned 18 and evicted from the underage orphanage she was living at. She has a solitary and pensive way of living her life. Considered picky and hard to manage by the head mistress of the home. Now it's time for Victoria to find a job, and a home. It was natural that she approaches a local flower shop for a job and the owner takes her in and helps her find a home as well. Soon Victoria is finding friendships and even though a bit awkwardly begins forming a family all her own.<br />When going into this book I did expect all the details about the flowers, it's a given. But something deeper was the detail paid to each subject brought up in the story. From Victoria's sporadic eating habits, her youth testing grapes, to her giving birth. The descriptive language not only paid to the portions of flowers, but every detail of her life. The writing style was very poignant and sticks with you, even the more uncomfortable scenes as the giving birth chapters that was even a bit too detailed for my taste.<br />I really enjoyed reading this book because of the beautiful writing and unique character Victoria. Her life, her friends and her family.

B0050QEYBK|4.0|Tristan, a young strong and determined man decides to win the heart of Victoria, he must get her the fallen star by crossing the wall. In a fairy tale story for adults, this book is full of dark characters, some sexual relations and a little cursing. A story that revolves around showing his affection for one girl by getting her something that she cannot refuse. Tristan's travels through the lands beyond the wall will not only test his true feelings for Victoria. He will learn a truth about himself and his destiny.<br /><br />Tristan Thorn, a naive and overly optimistic boy finally runs into the star turned girl Yvaine. Yvaine, not only having had a very rough landing, yet now trying to be taken as Tristan's possession is overly stubborn and unamused by their ventures. She's in pain and kind of pissed off that she fell in the first place. Not only the fact that several people desire her to become theirs and she's stuck with a young Tristan, a newcomer to the land. Together they have to endure several struggles, interesting creatures/animals and some very dark characters. Before they can finally get back home.<br /><br />This story is very imaginative, full of many dark and exuberant characters, yet not as humorous as I suppose I was expecting. It takes a darker fairy tale feel closer to the Grimm Brothers than Disney. Although all aspects of the story work really well together, there are times I wanted more of some characters and I felt the book had room for. When the book came to a close, you don't get your happily ever after here. It's a very contemplative and melancholy ending, yet perfect for the characters in this tale.<br /><br />It's a romantically driven book. As Tristan initially has the focus of winning over Victoria back home. To truly becoming enamored with Yvaine, the fallen star. As they gradually go through these adventures together it's bound to happen that the feelings will come. When they do, the reader roots for their connection and in a way, we all wish for that happily ever after.<br /><br />William Morrow & Company has recently released the newest editions of this book both the This special gift edition and the Signed Gift Edition. I received a copy of the gift edition which is has a gorgeous blue cloth cover with a gold stamped cover.l wish for that happily ever after.<br /><br />William Morrow & Company has recently released the newest editions of this book both the This special gift edition and the Signed Gift Edition.

B00DP3IESY|5.0|The initial advertising for Oblivion seemed to be that of a typical sci-fi/apocalypse film.  I'm glad I went to see it myself.  The plot is original, the acting is great and it's just plain fun to watch.  I enjoyed Oblivion more than just about any other movie I've seen in the last few years.
140006922X|5.0|I respect the author for bringing an historian's method to discover the life and times of Jesus the man.  This gives credibility to the fact that the Bible has been written by men for men.  These were men just like us: flawed, opinionated, and very often ignorant of anything outside their realm of perception.  In a word: human.

1612680011|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It changed my mind about real estate and has actually motivated me to learn more about it. But it also made learn more about business in general. It has pushed me to want to learn more about what I do because it only makes sense. But sometimes we can get very caught up or busy with life that we tend to forget to broaden our knowledge for further opportunities. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to start a real estate career or simply a business career.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Highly recommended - even if you have seen the Netflix-series.<br />The series is more of a mix and match of the characters in the book. It's not qualified as a spoiler of the series.<br /><br />It gives you a insight of what life behind the walls is like, even if it's not like that for everyone. I feel that it's wrong stigmatization, like many of the reviews contain \\"just because she is educated, white, etc.\\", based on the background. For me it gives more the impression that everyone can make mistakes!<br /><br />Everyone should have a open mind when reading this, not based on all the \\"consistence\\" of the reviews - go after how many stars it has received. Make up your own mind :)

B00DYVUBYM|5.0|Sofia Coppola dishes out another intriguing, yet slow- burn indie flick. This time, Sofia delves into a much more hard- hitting story of teenagers infatuation with glitz and glamour. Sofia has her certain way of directing: she tends to focus on characters for a long time with no movement of the camera. To some, this can get tedious, but for anyone going in not just for the story, but for the directing itself, The Bling Ring delivers Coppola's usual directing. The story can get repetitive (they steal from many houses and occasionally go back to the same house, so it begins to be the same thing every time), but I knew what it was going to be like because I did much research on the case before seeing the movie. Final Consensus: The Bling Ring shows Coppola making a ripped from the headlines story come true in the best way possible. Glossy and articulate, The Bling Ring is an fascinating turn for Coppola and presents her at her desirable best.

B00C2VGAW2|5.0|While watching the movie I thought, &#34;This music is so cool, I've got to get the soundtrack.&#34;  Infusing hip hop with ragtime?  Genius!  Now, as I listen to the music in my car, I'm instantly transported back to memorable scenes in the film and can experience music unlike anything on the radio today.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|I liked the line of Cooking/Hotel Dash games, but I've come to realize these are best suited for computer play ... with a mouse ... these are very difficult to play by touch.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love scribblenauts! I think it's awesome! My cousin and I love to play it together and we would have so much fun!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like multiple wake up setting ... I have several different times set and all I need to do to pick one is select a checkbox.  It has separate features for each alarm.  I like the snooze feature, and the fact that I can set it beyond the 9 minutes of my alarm clock.  Seriously, I don't even look at the alarm clock anymore.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|The App is wonderful and works well. LOVE IT!<br />Will do business again.<br />We are very satisfied .<br /><br />Thanks again
B005HSL626|3.0|This game is fun for a while.  Then it gets boring ... so I moved on to other games ...
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's an awesome game yet it only has room for three suits other than that it's kinda like subway surfers except with armor. So please up date the game so it DOES NO COST SO MANY ISO-8's JUST TO GET MORE SPACE. Future Reference. So get the game and enjoy I bet u will
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This was ok, but the &#34;cool&#34; factor of the graphics wore off quickly.  Just a bit much for a horse monitoring game.
B002KYHZLQ|2.0|Let me preface this by saying, I am the type that once I start something I cannot stand to not finish it. The kindle samples really get me, once I have read a few chapters, I have to finish the book. This is the first time I have had an entire series, already written, that I did not finish and have no desire to finish. After reading book 6, I have had enough.<br /><br /> There are some good scenes in the books I read. Generally they are the mundane scenes of just basic warfare. The magic system in these books is really bad. There are no rules whatsoever.<br />In one scene a person can barely blow some dust with magic, at the end of the book they are waving their hand and everything is fixed. Not just one book, but every book I have read so far it is the exact same thing. The conflict gets very complex, confused, twisted, etc. It doesn't matter though, at the end, the resolution is always the same. Some god in the shadows steps out, waves his hand and catastrophe avoided. Over and over and over. This is not an intelligent series. You don't get to see people work their way out of a problem. No, someone steps in, waves their hands and BOOM problem solved. The only consistency is the lack of consistency.<br /><br /> As far as death goes... well it is a joke. There are so many POVs that you don't bond with any single character. At times you get a few paragraphs and then it switches to the next POV. At most you get a couple of pages before you switch POV. How can you care if they die if you can't ever get into any type of flow reading about them?<br /><br /> Oh, and then, if it is a character that you might actually like, well they don't die anyway.<br />Wave of hand, boom, all fixed. If they are dead, dead, well then they ASCEND and become godlike.<br /><br /> This might very well be the most lame series I have ever bothered trying to read. The plot is almost always out of control, the povs change so often that it crimps the flow, and the resolutions are always forced and ridiculous.<br /><br /> Don't waste your time.
0470932139|4.0|I read this book from the beginning to the end. Great information on food/product photography. Author gave great information on every aspect with food photography.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. Travis was flawed but amazing in that flawedness. Couldn't put the book down. It wasn't Shakespeare but it was still good.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is a great case.  It has a hard rubber body for protection and the built in stand feature is just what I was looking for,  The elastic closure belt works great too.  Has a felt type lining that is nice and soft to the touch.  I really Like it.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|The dull graphics coupled with the very slow coin regen rate make this game rather boring. If you want a more colorful coin game with superior graphics, better power ups, cooler prizes, and much faster coin regen rate, then download Coin Party instead.

B005EHNMWM|5.0|Wilco is my favorite band. I love everything I've ever heard from them. Jeff Tweedy (frontman) is the best thing to happen to music since Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Neil Young, etc. etc. ...

B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This is another brilliant Tarantino movie.  Filled with action, suspense, even some romance.  If you aren't easily bothered by strong language or lots of bloody violence, it's an amazing movie.  Leo Dicaprio gives and amazing performance.  Maybe the best part of the whole movie.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a very addictive game.  It is a lot like playing Clown Town, without the carnival. Hope you have fun.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Reminded me of Van Helsing.  The modern touches were funny.  The action was great!  Very stylish.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Watching this movie on Blu Ray was just awesome! Schindlers List is one of the all time greatest movies ever made IMO!!! First hand accounts make this movie tops for its accuratecy. This was money well spent.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great little product, its reasonably priced and does its job well. Very nice little product and would make a good small gift for anyone who likes to have a sharp knife. I've bought a few of these and will buy again.

B006P4FBUE|5.0|This app is so useful for learning, and you don't need to know how to play in the first place! The reason why this is five stars is because this is an all around fantastic app for people who like to play the piano, but you can't just carry one around all the time. Well, now, you can!  :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really good app ! If you like horses you should have this app. It is very realistic
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The changes to this app are terrible! It was great before and I really loved it. I hate it now and just uninstalled it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|My advise: read this. Period. It's hard to put into words seeing war in this day and age from someone who repeatedly saw it first-hand, and what those sacrifices for our country look like to those who actually make them.<br /><br />For an everyday guy, it's well-written and carries you through his training and combat tours, and includes numerous inserts from his wife.<br /><br />Again, just read it. You won't be disappointed.
B008LVCKH6|4.0|The aspect I enjoyed most was the way the author cleverly wove actual historical events into his novel. I had never read a book before that used this technique so effectively.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Although the concept is just like temple run this game is truely original. While running you battle villians, collect bananas, and gain exciting powerups to advance you further in the game. As I said it is like temple run,  but geared more towards younger kids.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is freaken awesome I love it. It's like subway suffers but it is very original. I recommend it to everyone.
0770437400|5.0|Came in great condition started reading, and has been an interesting book so far that I have read. Wanted to read before the movie came out, but still plan on reading before I see the movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|INSPIRING AND MOVING STORY About TRUE hero's,,DEDICATED AND MOTIVATED to serve their country.Makes you want to meet a Navy Seal and give him a hug and shake his hand.
1451696191|5.0|This book was great. It was so easy to get caught up in and read through quickly. The kid, and his friends are very easy to relate to for anyone that has gone through some of the same things in highschool, or who can just relate to what it is like to be a teenager. I would say that this book is worth reading, but the ending of the book did get to me it made me cry also upsetting me in a way, but otherwise great book that shows human emotions at it's finest.
B00C32R64G|5.0|Have been into these guys for as long as I can remember. I LOVED their old album The strength/ The sound/ The sounds, Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil, and the best: Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood... While not being on the same level as these, they still rock hard and great on this album. They made small changes but not enough to ruin the style of the band. This has some good songs on it I will give it that, The best of this band is definitely Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood but, sill a great addition to any Volbeat fan!!!
0345529057|5.0|The product showed up great with no problems would say that if you are a fan of Games of Thrones you should give it a chance. Have not read them yet, but am glad I purchased them.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Best game ever!!!!<br />The whole family is playing this game!!!it's a classic game but it's easier to play on the kindle,,,more games like this one please
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you're a kid that likes horses then you'll love this.I downloaded this game to try it now I'm in love with it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It loads fast and has everything I need to make my decisions on the farm. Very useful and convenient. Great.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|the game is fun You can pick up and play it for pretty good while before getting bored. if you want to get upgrades free it could literally take weeks. but it is definitely one of the best free games in the app store id say in the top 50.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I ordered this for download on Kindle because it was on my daughter's required summer reading list (she is going into 8th grade).  She wasn't sure if she was going to like it at first, but she ended up loving it!  She enjoyed the plot and all the characters and says that every chapter brought a new adventure to the story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy this app! When I am anywhere that has no wi -fi, Dr office, car etc. it a great way to pass time! The programis. great and don't have the annoying drag and drop like the one on my PC.
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|My four year old granddaughter loves this. I am amazed at how soon she learned to play it. Keeps her busy while we are in the car.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I liked my previous version, then one day maybe a month ago, it was all different.  Adds!!!!!  Can't move or put radar in motion!!!! Harder to use , hate the adds, and NOT functional.  I HATE IT!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome.in fact it is so awesome I have it on my iphone and kindle.I like the bananas they collect.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I have ordered this item twice. The first unit functioned perfectly until it was unluckily struck by the corner of a falling laptop. The laptop corner landed exactly on the plastic charging housing, splintering it. On the bright side, it seemed to have cushioned the fall of the laptop as it was undamaged. I don't recommend trying this at home.<br /><br />The replacement unit has also performed flawlessly. Charging time is greatly reduced by using this method. Attach the charging cable to a higher powered USB brick for best results. I attach it to a 2A brick.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|I really enjoyed catching up with the characters again, although it was a very harrowing story at times. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in social history.
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies of all time. Kids and adults will find the movie funny and endearing. The minions have a lot more facetime in this movie.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|For owners of the Secret World Live DVD, know that this BLu Ray edition is an entirely different show, different song orders, better audio DTS-Master HD, Much improved video, a more polished show, better use of Peter's amazing bag of tricks, better in every way. In my opinion it is worth getting to replace the DVD version, it is that much better. This is Peter at his peak, probably the best he will ever be and has ever been. You will not be disappointed. Buy it. Used it is so cheap it's a no-brainer. 5 stars and one of the best music discs ever made.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Pacific Rim got hammered pretty hard by a lot of confused critics who apparently only know Guillermo del Toro from his more artistic magical realism work and somehow missed Hellboy, Mimic, and Blade 2. Pacific Rim belongs solidly to the latter camp, but it's a labor of love and is missing none of the flair that makes del Toro films so special. At its core it is essentially a Western Super Sentai film; heroes suit up in giant robots to battle monsters that are invading our dimension... And that's it. You can foist all sorts of allegory onto this movie if you want, and you can plumb it for deeper meaning- it's rich enough- but at the end of the day it's a thrilling adventure about friendship, big robots, and monster punching. Wet blankets need not apply.<br /><br />Short summary: a portal to an alien world opens under the ocean and giant monsters come out. The governments of the world team up to battle them, eventually doing so with Jaegers, huge robots piloted by two psychically linked pilots who must act in tandem to control their war machines. For a while this goes swimmingly, but the money dries up and the monsters keep coming, and soon the fate of the world rests on crusty and intensely likeable Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) who runs the world's last 4 jaegers in an endless war against the monsters out of Hong Kong. Pentacost has a plan to destroy the portal that brings the monsters to earth but to do that he recruits emotionally scarred Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) who must copilot with the impetuous and vengeful Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) for one last big mission. Cue a ton of fighting and explosions.<br /><br />This film showcases a lot of newcomer actors to great effect. The burgeoning friendship between Mori and Becket is particularly well done (it is best described as a guy-girl bromance really) and the rest of the cast does science, runs from monsters, or is Ron Perlman (yes that's a role now) very effectively. Idris Elba gets to play to his strengths very well here and chew a lot of scenery as an AGING HERO with SAD SECRETS, and lest you think that del Toro will craft a strong black lead then stick him in an office like every other director, rest assured that Pentacost punches monsters in a big robot too.<br /><br />Of course the fights are the meat of the film and they do not disappoint. The robots and monsters convey a powerful sense of size and weight, as their enormous fists, tails, and jaws gnash and hit with weight and authority. Fights are almost wholly digital affairs and perhaps to save money they are usually in rainy darkness, but they are still exciting and tense. The multi-stage throwdown in Hong Kong at the film's peak is one of the best giant monster battles ever committed to film and I say that as a die-hard Godzilla fan.<br /><br />Some critics have panned this film for a lack of depth, but the truth is that it does what it wants to- deliver a summer blockbuster- and it does so with unprecedented depth. Its writing, performances, and effects easily put it on par with The Avengers as a smart summer action romp, and to disrespect this film because it's not another Pan's Labyrinth is sort of like saying a really good ice cream sundae is undeserving of your time because it's not a baked Alaska. Lest we overlook it too, Rim is also an ORIGINAL film in an industry plagued by remakes, sequels, and general unoriginality. You don't have to buy it (although I would) but you should absolutely see it in theaters or rent it at least once. Don't miss out.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Endearing performances from a young cast (with help from some veterans)<br />-Way, way better than Cloverfield<br />-Blends Artsy del Toro's flair for eerie creatures and dream imagery with comic geek del Toro's love of SMASH POW BAM<br />-Effective ear bug soundtrack will stick with you<br />-Really good 3D if that's your thing<br /><br />CONS<br />-Some of the other Jaeger crews are not very well developed<br />-The very beginning cramsa lot of exposition in pretty fast<br /><br />UPDATE 10/21/2013<br /><br />So I received and watched the disk. The standard version of Rim comes in a handsome slipcase with a fun holographic cover that APPEARS to be removable (although a true collector won't want to of course...). The BD itself is easily navigable and all trailers are skippable. There is a whole other disk of special features which I have not yet watched. Overall this feels very premium, more like a collector's edition than a basic retail set. The case doesn't even have cutouts to save material as many BD cases do nowadays.<br /><br />Picture quality is outstanding overall. On the small screen, and without the slight softening effect of 3D, this actually reveals some sort of cheap-looking CGI in the first Kaiju encounter during the opening narration*. Thankfully, subsequent battles look great. The movie is free from excessive cleanup and boasts the odd bit of grain, making it look very filmic and natural, even when big monsters and big robots are clubbing one another with bits of dockyard.<br /><br />Audio is suitably bombastic and rich, with voices, music, and effects all mixed to a consistent, listenable volume range (I'm looking at you, first two Iron Man films on home video).<br /><br />Overall this is a great Blu Ray and watching it at home the film held up to my initial high opinion.<br /><br />* This is probably because much of this sequence was produced long before editing of the remainder of the film was completed.a lot of exposition in pretty fast<br /><br />UPDATE 10/21/2013<br /><br />So I received and watched the disk.

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I loved the novel and wasn't sure that it could be successfully translated to film, but now I've added this to my list of all-time favorites.  Those who haven't read the novel may have to work a little to merge the various story lines, but it is worth it.  The acting, the settings, the cinematography are all of the highest quality.  Absolutely first rate.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Tarantino casts Christoph Waltz as the key Nazi and Brad Pitt as the leader of a squad of wacked out (but deadly!) American Special Forces who work behind the lines to wreak havoc with the enemy in occupied France during WWII.  Masterful work by QT, Brad Pitt, and every one else - especially Christoph Waltz.  I give it an unreserved 5 STARS!
B003VWU2WA|3.0|I absolutely loved this thing.<br />Sadly, Griffin has chosen to not create a driver for Windows 8.  For this reason everything I write is in past tense.<br />The attractive PowerMate had so many functions and customization options.  It was a high quality product that allowed you be more efficient with many programs.<br /><br />This product would be a solid 5 stars if Griffin would update their software to be used with Windows 8.  I have heard directly from Griffin that they have no intentions of creating a windows 8 Driver.  NOT COOL GRIFFIN... NOT COOL...
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Since Iraq, my mind has not been what it used to be.  I have problems remembering many things and with the pressures of life, it makes trying to remember something even harder.... It is a great way for me to jot something down to remember later on so it wont be that &#34;what was it&#34; moment.
0345529057|5.0|This might be a little out of date since the fifth book came out, but I started reading this saga on borrowed books from friends. Having brand new edition in a box (and by the time I bought it I still had to read books 3 and 4). Helps a lot, and it looks really good too.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|What can you say about the social media hype?  Its been around for so long I doubt if any review I did would make a difference.  Not that I dont have a voice but hey Facebook is and always will be the number one social media site..... I just dont use it as often as many others do.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is free of error and is great! Thanks for exchanging the faulty one and sending me a new one!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|My daughter and I have played this many times and out of the 50 or so times, we fooled him maybe twice.  One could be because I really am not the type to follow social media and stars or starlets, but the daughter did with someone who was really popular.  If you wanna kill time while alone and feel as if you are talking trivia with someone to fool them....... get this one!!!!
B004PYDBVM|4.0|Chol-hwan tale is both terrifying as well as an eye opener.  Reminds us of the Nazi regime and what brainwashing a population by terror and isolation can do.  And to think this book was written 13 years ago!  As a free democratic nation, we need to keep this and other criminal regimes in the public eye.  North Korea  scares me more than all of the terrorist states. We, as a country, need to hear more of the stories of the North Korean defectors<br />. Very disturbing story, but we need to hear more of...
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Well thats how its been for me.  A challenge that has not once disapointed me one bit.  I have tried lots of germs LOL and different combinations but the game somehow beats me to killing the worlds population.... One day I will!!!! LOL
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Fantastic range of sounds that can be played singly or in any combination you choose.  The app even has some suggested &quot;thematic&quot; combinations you can try. You can adjust the volume of each sound to blend them in the way that appeals to you.  Great app!
B0097K21YW|4.0|Its a really simple game that makes you feel like an Artillery Gunner... you have to adjust his distance and his angle to get his fire to destroy the buildings.  If you destroy more with one shot..... Extra points.  I dont play it all the time but it is one that make you take your frustrations out on something innocent.

B00BSN0K1C|1.0|I just got off the phone with Mattel and they confirmed, the pictures you are looking at are of a prototype.  Where as the Jor-El and Zod figures look identical to the pictures on the box and have great likeness to the characters in the film, Superman does not!  The prototype has a near perfect likeness to Henry Cavill, but the Movie Masters figure you will receive might as well be any guy off the street in a cape.  The uniform itself has improved from the prototype and looks a lot closer to the film, but don't expect the face to look like the actor, because it won't!  Very disappointed in Mattel for FALSE ADVERTISING!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I loved this book.  I just couldn't put it down and I was so surprized with the ending.  I have always loved reading Nicholas Sparks' books.  I would recommend this book for anyone from a teenager up.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great weather app just the type of weather app I was looking for.<br />Best weather app I've used. I like the forecast on it.
B00BF11STU|5.0|I don't know whether this movie is a documentary or a docudrama. But it was fascinating, fast-paced and absolutely riveting. I'm more than happy to buy this movie a pass if it failed some points on accuracy because those points sure weren't obvious nor did they detract from the excitement.  WELL worth the price of &#34;admission.&#34;
0062255657|2.0|This novel just didn't reach the levels of literature that I would expect from Neil Gaiman.  Thin plot, flat characters and maudlin villains.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Entertaining. Somewhat challenging.  Oftentimes more frustrating than invigorating. But worth some time. I wonder why amazon makes me say so much...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I liked the two main characters<br />Plot was great and kept me interested the whole time<br />Loved the ending. Good always wins!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I gave this book a 5 star rating . It was awesome! I did not want to finish it. It was better than I expected. It keep me wanting more. I am in love with Christian and love Ana. I highly recommend it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the suspense and the building of the plot<br />Total twist on characters-did not end like I would have ended it.
B00CJGP116|5.0|Love this album. The songs and production are great! Marc's vocals are beautiful, passionate and strong!! I love the way he sings each song. Love salsa music. The pop version of his #1 hit single Vivir Mi Vida is a fun way to close out the cd. He even sings it slightly differently from the salsa version. Great job Marc!!
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I am a huge fan and performer of musical theatre. Though it is a hard decision, The Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables are my favorite musicals. I was recently given this recording, having listened to many other versions. The cast is excellent, and you can feel their excitement as they are being energized by the enthusiastic audience. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is, of course, excellent, and the sound quality is very good, especially considering it was recorded live.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts on the lead singers:<br /><br />- Colm Wilkinson (Jean Valjean): The original London and Broadway Jean Valjean. The song \\"Bring Him Home\\" was written for his voice. He is a soaring Irish tenor with an incredible high range. His voice sounds older on this recording than it does on the London and Broadway soundtracks, and he has a harder time sustaining low notes, but his high range is still in top form. Even with his voice not in its prime, his performance is wonderful. He conveys the character and sets the standard for all other actors who have since played Valjean.<br /><br />- Philip Quast (Inspector Javert): Perhaps the quintessential Javert. His intense, precise diction and powerful vocals perfectly portray the rigid inspector. He is excellent in \\"The Confrontation\\", brings the house down with the beautiful power ballad \\"Stars\\", and is conflicted, troubled, and desperate in \\"Javert's Suicide\\". His flawless performance is one of the highlights of the album.<br /><br />- Ruthie Henshall (Fantine): She has a beautiful, powerful, emotional voice that is wonderful in all of her scenes. Her \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is one of the best versions I have heard, and \\"Fantine's Death\\" is sung with touching vulnerability. She shines in all of her vocals.<br /><br />- Alun Armstrong (Thenardier): My favorite Thenardier. He has perfect comic timing, and a delightful cockney accent that is perfect for the character. He gives a strong performance on all of his songs, especially \\"Master of the House\\".<br /><br />- Jenny Galloway (Madame Thenardier): My favorite Madame Thenardier. She really gets into the part, and is very funny because of that. She has a great character voice used for this part and others I've heard her in. You can also see her in the 25th Anniversary production.<br /><br />- Michael Ball (Marius): He is fabulous. The best Marius, he gives the character a depth Marius doesn't otherwise have. His love duets with Judy Kuhn are lovely, and \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\" is emotional and beautiful. Michael Ball has one of the best romantic voices musical theatre has seen.<br /><br />- Michael Maguire (Enjolras): The essential Enjolras. I don't give this award lightly, as Enjolras is probably my favorite character. Michael Maguire has both the physical look and the vocal power necessary for the part. He debuted on Broadway as Enjolras in the original Broadway cast of Les Miserables, and won both a Tony and a Drama Desk for his performance. While others are excellent (such as Anthony Warlow and Ramin Karimloo) my opinion is that for this role, no one can beat him. His excitement as he rallies the revolutionaries and his charismatic persona immediately show you who is the leader at the barricade.<br /><br />- Lea Salonga (Eponine): Along with Frances Ruffelle, one of the best Eponine actresses. Some people feel that her diction is too crisp for a street waif, but in my opinion that enhances the part, as you can always clearly understand what she is singing. She has a beautiful voice, and does an excellent version of \\"On My Own, and an emotional duet with Michael Ball, \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\".<br /><br />- Judy Kuhn (Cosette): Judy Kuhn has a beautiful soprano voice with a rich tone. She is the only Cosette I have heard who succeeds in sounding lovely, instead of being too high-pitched and annoying. I am saying this as a very high 1st soprano. The part is written in such a consistently high register that even sopranos with great voices can be irritating. Judy Kuhn, however, has both a high range and a rich tone, a very rare thing. This prevents her from sounding \\"chipmunky\\". She is the only person who I really enjoy listening to as Cosette.<br /><br />- Anthony Crivello (Grantaire): The original Broadway actor. He sings both his comic lines and serious lines exceptionally well. My favorite Grantaire.<br /><br />- Adam Searles (Gavroche): A vivacious performance with a good Cockney accent.<br /><br />Every part, even bit parts, are sung incredibly. The chorus is filled with energy. This truly is \\"the Dream Cast\\" right down to the one-line soloists and chorus. Though this does not have every single thing sung in the show, it has the main songs. Some find the applause distracting, but as a musical theatre performer, I like it, as I can sense the excitement of both the cast and the audience. I have heard many recordings, but in my opinion, this is still the best.es can be irritating. Judy Kuhn, however, has both a high range and a rich tone, a very rare thing.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Tried a zoom and xyboard. Cannot enter name or seed. Works fine on Galaxy Tab 2.<br /><br />My kids love this game!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I have not read a book that has moved me more that this one.  I rarely make a review/remark about a book but this one really tugged at my soul.  I read it all in one sitting and am glad I did.  It will haunt you , make you cry  and leave you mad/angry/sad all at the same time.This is a book that I would/will recommend to my friends and will re-read it.  I am looking forward to reading more by this author.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I love this movie, I saw it at the theater first and when it started I thought, &#34;oh no! It's all singing&#34; but as I got into the movie, I just loved it. So did my 15yo daughter who hates musicals and didn't want to watch it. It is now her favorite movie.
B009YQJ322|4.0|Like stated above I probably wouldn't have viewed this had I NOT THOUGHT that It was a sequel to the original (first-with Stallone). The characters were very good and it gave me a GR8er appreciation 4 the story line. Upon discovering my mistake (I thought this was the Stallone version sorry), I soon discovered it wasn't all that bad It was actually worth the purchase!<br /> Always a satisfied customer of Amazon.com and it's affiliates,<br />  LeAnne M Pruitt
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|It arrived in a few days, sooner than I expected. It was in perfect condition and watched several times. The first season was when I got hooked and couldn't resist getting the second season. Now I will have to get the third season. Can't wait for the new episodes this fall. Normally I don't like blood and gore movies but this has happened to normal people around Atlanta where I live. Makes you think how you behave and what you might become under the same circumstances.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|Def. recommend! Love how they remastered it and the 3D effects are awesome! It's a must have! Don't let it pass.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey Collector's Edition<br />Sony Computer Entertainment was new game and fun to play on my play station 3 it's was a best buy
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new weather channel is terrible! I DON'T want to unlock achievements, I want to see what's going on with the weather.  It used to be my go to but no more.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Our youngest child is 7.  My husband is a serious gamer.  This game is the perfect family game because we all love it and enjoy it.  I also think it is educational (don't tell my kids!).  Single friends and married friends alike love this game.  The teens in my youth group play it too- it is one of the most universally enjoyed games out there, in my experience.
B00B4RP0OO|5.0|Only video player that plays 1080p mkv video smoothly on kindle fire hd. Can also stream 1080p flawlessly over smb share over WiFi.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|Pink Floyds music is timeless...for us older beings it brings the smiles from our yesterdays back...<br /><br />for the younger folks this timeless music is something to hear, enjoy, take into ones heart and just believe...<br /><br />real ARTISTS exist at any age!!!!!!
B002DJSBMA|5.0|I bought this for a friend's birthday because its his favorite movie and it came the day after I ordered it. Awesome!
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Loved the movie cant wait to have the dvd to watch as much as I want<br />Told all I know to go watch it
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|Seriously, it was awesome. I am 28 and loved this. Ask of my nieces (ages 5-10) loved it as well. That is all the time I'll waste writing this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is great it is so good that I could play it all day and all night<br />YOU SHOULD GET IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wanted to read the rest of this series before the movie came out. For a teen book it kept my interest . I thought it was well written. I loved getting to know the characters. Very thought-provoking as what could become of the future.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is fun, addicting and easy to play.  I love it and my 10-year-old brother is always begging to borrow my kindle fire so he can play this game.  The graphics are great and I love how you can accessorize your minion in different costumes.<br /><br />HOWEVER...sometimes the game freezes and an ad pops up.  Usually once I close the ad the game starts itself up again, but a few times I've had to go back to the home screen and reopen the app.  If your device freezes up a lot, DO NOT get this app.<br /><br />Also, some of the missions are practically impossible unless you have a Facebook.  Not everyone is on FB! Don't let this stop you from getting  the app though:)  I may be 14 but I still like minion rush
B009VYAVTG|5.0|I am amazed how good this series is. Keeps you on your toes, you'll want more for sure. Great action, for kids and adults as well. Colin Morgan is perfect for this role with his boy-ish figure.<br /><br />BBC, please make more seasons!
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I heard \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" on Pandora, and had to go to the interwebs and see if that was Sting I was hearing? No, apparently not. I will have to listen to the rest of the album before I really put a review out there, but I was really surprised that it wasn't Sting singing. Five stars until I can let you know what I really think!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I gave this a four because it was simply written.  But, my teenaged daughter really liked it.  I would recommend it for teens.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Fun series of youth fighting for good in a future dystopian society. It was interesting, exciting, eventful, sci-fi. I liked it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I truly believe that this game is really fun! If you play, you get to experience how to work for a home. Nemo and his dad make their own reef for friends and guests to live in. It was assigned to Nemo from school as homework. The more money you collect from the sponges, coral, and seaweed, the more you get to buy more for your village. The more time you put into your reef, the more fun it will be.  :D Have fun working with Nemo and his father in this fun adventure!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I started reading this b/c it will be out as a movie this year. Loved the concept. The book opens you up to a new world.
0385349947|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found inspiration to renegotiate in the workplace. Passed this book on to my grown daughters, as well.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|Who doesn't love Jack Skellington? TNBC is one of his best works ever. Its for kids and adults. It for fun and learning (I use it in class during the holidays for compare & contrast and other such concepts). Its for Christmas and Halloween. So fun to see the meeting of these two worlds.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This was a very good book. Some parts were a little slow for me and that's the only reason it got 4 stars. It would be so frustrating to not remember things from one day to the next, But you really feel sorry for the character. But overall an excellent book and I definitely didn't see that twist coming!!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love reading all of the Sookie Stackhouse novels. Its a whole new world and she is a great heroine.
8866137634|5.0|The quality is excelent as usual for all Moleskine products. The additional functionalities for Evernote users are simple and functional, allowing handwritten notes and sketchs to be photographed and sent to the Evernote account.<br /><br />It is just all that I expected and read about it. Thanks Moleskine and Evernote!
B009PNQUXO|1.0|Like Larry Theil Jr. &quot;Book reader&quot; said, it only shows the top videos. When I go to browse, and start up a video it loads forever and the video never comes. Bad.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I think this is a amazing book, though I only recommend it for teens. The reason is that it uses unfriendly language. But other than that it is a great book for si-fi lovers, like me!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|love this show, hope it has many more years ahead surely hate the Ziba is living though very sad to hear
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Definitely a fun little game that makes you think.  I would have liked to give it 5 stars, but there just are not enough levels.  Hope there is an update soon so that I can get more levels for this game!
B001D0BLTA|5.0|I felt like watching this movie after many, many years of not viewing it.  It is just so well done that it was a hoot to view that dress and attitude from way back in the day.  Lots of actors you will recognize, some even coming out in current shows as we speak.  I liked it and still do.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|It's another quality CD from Michael Buble.  If you are a fan of his, definitely get your hand on this one!
B009UQCD0K|5.0|This has become one of my favorite TV shows since they have taken the zombie genre and crashed past its limits in a truly explosive fashion. This started as a survival horror show, in which the people were pretty much trying to stay alive while avoiding the walkers, but it has morphed into so much more. In this season, the zombies are still there, but they have pretty much become part of the scenery. Yes, they are still dangerous and become a problem in cases, but the much bigger threat comes from other humans. We have the old issues rising up in this new world, where greed, self-interest and the us vs. them mentality rules the day.<br /><br />One of the aspects of this series I enjoy the most is the growth of the characters, especially Rich, who by virtue of being the leader of his group has to not only think about his immediate family, but also his extended one. This leads him to make many decisions that go against what he used to believe in when he was a cop in his previous life, and the effects are sometimes dramatic. As has been the case previously, the creators of the series have no qualms in killing off important characters, so you'd be best served to not get too attached to any of them in particular. I thoroughly enjoy this level of uncertainty when watching a series.<br /><br />Having been reading the graphic novel too, I really like how they have changed the story in the TV series. This has pretty much given me two zombie stories instead of one repeated across two different mediums. Some of the basic elements of the plot are similar, but the characters, who dies and who lives, and how certain key stories develop are all different. If you have not checked out the graphic novel do yourself a favor and try it out too.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the 4th season of this series, it cannot come fast enough!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a great book for a Book Club or discussion group.  I really can't get it out of my head.  What would you do if your child was accused of a heinous crime?  Would you protect and defend them to the end even in the face of damning evidence?  A very thought provoking read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has great graphics&hellip;its free and loads of fun. I love the challenges also. I'm not a kid either I'm in my 30's playing this fun game.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Really great app, I use it everyday. Having large buttons. makes it very easy to see and use. I like having two calculators in one.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|What a story. What a cast.  Couldn't stop watching from one episode to another. Spellbinding. Filmed to perfection..  Couldn't wait to start second season.  Watched both twice all the way through.  See it
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I couldn't stop reading once I started, this is one of her best books I have read and I can say with confidence that I have read almost all her books. I can't wait for the next one with Kaleb Krychek.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a awesome game I play the on my kindle and my computer I clang wait for more updates
B007M45PMU|5.0|I like all the songs on this cd which can be hard to find. The songs are wonderful. I'm very happy with my purchase of it.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|10 beautiful songs, resplendent with tasteful, artistic, and sometimes aggressive musicianship, raw with emotion, a true musical journey, a dreamscape of suffering and salvation (or maybe damnation?), not one second of filler.  It's rare these days when you can say an album (yes, I said ALBUM) fires on all cylinders.  This one does that and more.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great app...lots of fun...easy to play and a great way to meet new people. Awesome game!! I'm addicted.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was sceptical at first, I refused to add another social app to my life.  Boy was I wrong about that. Pinterest is a fun way to share interests with people from around the world, without being in each other's business.<br /><br />The app works nicely, I haven't had any issues and if your contemplating whether or not to download it ..just do it.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Love the graphics and SFX. Fun gameplay and good replay value looking for all the gems. Wasn't't sure about this one until I played it; now I love it.
