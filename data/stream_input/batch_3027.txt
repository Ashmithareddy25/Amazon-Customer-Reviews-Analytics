B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a good game. It's really fun, and Free!!!! You can connect through Facebook. Hope you start playing it.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|The characters test were quite unique.  This relationship was not just believable,  it I think I ended up a little jealous.  Well written and unusual.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The app was great but for some reason I wasn't able to update it and had to delete it. Needs to be fixed
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|After a long time away, Nine Inch Nails makes their return with Hesitation Marks. While sounding similar to With Teeth with hints at Year Zero, HM still brings the angst and deep meaning that have been come to known with NIN. Great for NIN fans, if you're just getting on the bandwagon, look to The Downward Spiral, The Fragile and With Teeth.

B0035HKWLW|5.0|I've always loved this movie as a child. Its a great exciting movie will never get tired of it. great!
B00B7PIRIE|2.0|Each disc would freeze up and stop playing at some point. This was the only issue. The order was delivered in a timely manner and did not show any signs of wear or damage on the packaging. We were very disappointed with the glitches that prevented all of the disc from playing completely. We would have been pleased with the purchase otherwise.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great!! I luv the minions doing what they do best..........being DESPICABLE LOL The different stages r cool!
B00F57VFXO|4.0|The writing is excellent, the story compelling but the exploits are just beyond the pale.  On at least two occasions modern inventions sneak into the narrative such as an inflatable emergency slide on an airplane.  All in all, a page turner with some unexpected twists.
B00005KB9X|5.0|Natty Dread is also a very important man, they call him Sir, he is also a wonderful king lots of love
B0085A9HXS|5.0|First things first, don't watch the \\"Redemption\\" aspect of this film. Just watch \\"The Raid\\". It's better without the inexplicably terrible new Linkin Park soundtrack and astonishingly comical dub.<br /><br />The remix is in no way an improvement over the original soundtrack. I've nothing against LP, believe me, but the original soundtrack is simply more exciting and a lot more dramatic--I have no clue why they thought this poorly-done new soundtrack was warranted, because it makes the movie less exciting.<br /><br />OK, we have that out of the way? Cool. Now, if you've done this properly, you'll be listening to the original audio with subtitles (I know they can be annoying and I don't like to have to read subtitles either if I can help it, but anything's better than this laughably bad dub that couldn't possibly have taken more than a single afternoon).<br /><br />So, it goes like this:<br />The Raid: Redemption: One star. Seriously, with the dub and new soundtrack, you can't even take it as a dumb action flick. It's there, but with the new audio, it's just...No, just no.<br />The Raid (original): Five stars. Yes, it's that much better than the default settings on the disc.<br /><br />Now let's review \\"The Raid\\" briefly, in a few pros and cons to keep it nice and brief.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Some of the best martial arts sequences you'll ever see, especially given the cool context (no one's flying through China here on trees like in Crouching Tiger, it's just guns and fists and a lot of violent punching and kicking, not to mention some exciting takedowns involving windows, machetes, and exploding refrigerators.)<br />- Best. Villain. Ever. Not the drug-lord guy, he doesn't really do anything, but Mad Dog, his protector, who is portrayed as a maniac...And he really is. The title of \\"Mad Dog\\" fits him perfectly, as he just detonates into a fury of complex martial arts when he gets into his fights, all of which are very exciting. He clearly and openly seeks out challengers for hand-to-hand combat among everyone there, since he often gives the good guys tremendous advantages on purpose just so he can have some sort of fun. He never uses a gun because, as he says, \\"I never liked these things. Pulling a trigger to kill someone is just way too simple. It's like ordering take-out.\\" He literally positions two characters between him at one point before a fight just for the hell of it, like fighting one at a time isn't any fun at all and no challenge whatsoever. And who can blame him? You just can't stop this guy from beating the life out of everyone he comes across. He lives to fight hand-to-hand, and that's it. Screw guns, they're just a nuisance. He has this fanaticism of killing people with his bare hands, purely for the rush, to the point that he literally gets bored with fighting normally and intentionally ups the difficulty for himself (such as the aforementioned two-on-one he sets up for no real reason except his own pleasure). Yeah, he's one scary bastard.<br />- The Dragon of the film, Mad Dog, has his own finishing move, and it's not what you think. It's freaking frightening.  When he first uses it, it's just insane and unbelievably violent, yet signature for him. He's one scary bastard, even with a gun pointed at him.<br />- Crazy-cool protagonist who does a great job being a protagonist who can beat the crap out of anyone without mercy, you know, for justice.<br />- The police sergeant is also really cool and authoritative in his own way, and he definitely isn't all talk and no action. He also comes off as pretty intelligent along with being fierce. Nicely done character.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The plot is virtually identical to Dredd. Seriously, if you haven't seen Dredd, this is the film, just in a different context and with a higher budget. Even some of the scenes seem strikingly similar. Menacing drug lord on a high floor? Check. Sealed inside? Check. The practice of buying police to protect the drug lord from police?Check. Residents told to fight protagonists? Check. Drug lord on top floor watching everything through monitors? Check. Some similar spoilers? Check. Drug lab fight scene? Um...Yeah, check. I could go on, but yeah, pretty much the same movie, except Dredd was, well, Judge Dredd.<br />- For better or worse, and maybe not really a con, every single person in this film--all of which are oriental--seem to know advanced martial arts, even the freaking guys making meth who are minding their own business. Yes, it has that thing where every single Asian character knows martial arts, like they're somehow born with it. The meth lab guys are a real piece of work. There's no reason for them to know any type of self-defense, but they're still skilled enough to give the protagonists a good fight.<br />- The story initially appears to be the dumbest thing you've ever seen in your life and makes zero sense. This isn't a spoiler: The police can't handle when the power is cut. Yeah, apparently no one thought of that and brought so much as flashlights with them.<br />- The box says \\"30 Floors of Hell\\". There aren't 30 floors, there are clearly 15. The drug lord's on the 15th floor. What's with the extra 15 floors we never see?<br />- The box also says, iirc, \\"15 Elite Cops\\". But they aren't, they're rookies. That's not because they do stupid things, but because they're pointed out to almost all be rookies early in the film. So, uh, that's a lie. Not a big one, since the main characters can still kick enough ass for all of them combined, but these definitely aren't \\"elite cops\\". See: Flashlight problem, mentioned above.<br />- Gunplay is a bit over-the-top, since *everyone* uses fully-automatic assault rifles that apparently don't need reloading (do they ever replace their magazines?) throughout the film. Some might not mind that, but one Commando is enough. There is no unit on the planet that uses fully automatic weapons for the simple reason that it's a dumb idea, and when they're all *missing* with that wasted ammunition, it kind of destroys the effect. They might as well be semi-autoing, you know, like every police or military unit does in close-quarters combat.<br />- That thing regarding Andi...Well, not so well done. For his significance, he felt horribly underdeveloped, considering his key role in the film. They say a few sentences about him and that's it, despite that he turns out to be really, really significant. Well, whatever, no spoilers.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Okay, so that sounds like a lot of negatives, sure, but they're not that bad. The pros make up for it. It's not too long, it's stylish, and it gets its job done. Sure, the plot's about as deep as a generic PlayStation 2 shooter, but that's not necessarily an awful thing. It's a dumb popcorn flick, after all, and isn't supposed to be anything else, so no points off.<br /><br />Just remember: DO NOT LISTEN TO THE STUPID REMIX. And while you *may* be able to stomach the dub, it *does* suck. You'll probably choose subtitles, and you'll definitely want the original audio, which is paradoxically a lot more intense and heavy-metalish (as opposed to the downright strange and even boring electronic/nu-metal Linkin Park thing they threw on there) than the remix.<br /><br />Go for it if you want nothing but the dumbest of action and you like violent martial arts. Just remove the \\"Redemption\\" piece of it in favor of the much-better basic \\"The Raid\\" and you'll be good.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I got this app for studying because I can't have complete silence, but don't want to listen to something that I will get distracted by. There are 4 pages of different sounds and you can play multiple ones simultaneously for a custom background noise. There aren't many adds either which is nice. It is a great app.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I don't know why we never watched this series but we decided to see how we liked it.  The characters & acting are great and the stories very believable.  The only criticism is that at times, the filming seems fake.  It is usually with the outdoor scenes.  Otherwise, we love the show and look forward to Season 2/
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Omg I play  this every hour of the day. It is so cool. I have been stuck on a level.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|BBC does it again with an excellent series!  Great story lines, great acting, well produced.  My wife and I look forward to evenings with this show.
B000VI12ZS|4.0|Great movie with great detail a little Bloody though. Stays pretty good to historical Records. A movie you could watch a couple more times.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Not by far, but it is a fast read and a fun read.  Danny just doesn't prove to be as enthralling as Jack.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad you finally put candy crush saga on kindle fire.This makes my birthday the best. As yesterday was my birthday so I will give this a 5 star. Plan on playing this as much as I can. Next game I would like to see is pet rescue...... Thank You for the best bday ever.
B008EL25LE|3.0|I was excited to see this game come up on Amazon's free app of the day. I recently got Akzend (the first app) and really loved it! I love the story, the music, the way the game looks...I'm still playing it.<br /><br />Maybe it's just a sense of what style appears to whom, bit I am glad I didn't buy Akzend 2. The music is nice, but the game board art is more stylized - not my type of thing.  Also the little clicking and tapping and dropping sounds - I just found them all annoying. I guess little things really do make a difference and they all add up to make a great game, or a mediocre one.<br /><br />The game play is similar to Akzend 1, with more tutorial, I think. Match the tiles on the board, change the tile color underneath, get a token which needs to be dropped off the bottom to clear the level.  There are picture finds, and bug chasing on the match board which are challenging.<br /><br />Clearing the board progresses the storyline. Some of the story voicing is really cheesy, over-dramatic and disingenuine. I think that could have been done better for a $5 game.<br /><br />The story also doesn't flow nicely, at least not at the beginning. The ship ends up in an ocean whirlpool and then...you are looking for your broken glasses?! Ummm where did the ship go and the other crew members? Either I missed something or the story is choppy.<br /><br />I guess I had higher expectations, since I liked the previous game soooo much. I'm guessing this one might appeal to people though...there are some pretty story images and the game play can be fun and challenging.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the game but doesn't run as smoothly as I would like. I bought it originally and couldn't play for a while because of the constant loading screen. I got the update and lost all knob y data but haven't had the loading issue and enjoying the game again
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Because it involves a law firm, the main story has many supplementary cases that are being handled simultaneously, thus keeping interest high.  The main character finds herself unexpectedly having to reenter the work force and juggle raising children while navigating office politics and romantic approaches.  Meantime, her husband deals with being incarcerated and standing trial for questionable political maneuverings.  The acting is first rate.  The story is one that most viewers can relate to in one way or another.

B00008PX8P|5.0|This is probably the greatest rock 'n' roll video I've ever seen. Led Zep is the ULTIMATE rock 'n' roll band of all time (they make the Stones--a wonderful band and the BEST dance-band) seem like a bunch of posturing little boys. The music us sublime--especially GOIN' TO CALIFORNIA, which may be the greatest and most beautiful song I've ever heard (or seen performed--Jimmy Page's face is a map of ecstasy). If there IS a heaven, this is the music I expect to hear there. (FYI, I am a lover of classical music, especially German lieder, so that's really saying a lot. The ONLYmusic that gives this set any competition is the CLASSIC &#34;GRATEFUL DEAD MOVIE.&#34; Thanks for asking my opinion. I am 76 years old.
B00D29CBIU|5.0|Margaret's latest work is awesome!  She makes it so easy to look at patterns that I have held all my life and I'm so excited to go through each chapter.

I can't wait for season four already preordered.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Such a beautiful book!!  I love how beautifully this book is written.  It's not RELIGIOUS, it explains an experience that is life changing!!  So, profound!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great follow up to the Shining.  Danny becomes a man.  Excellent conclusion to the Shining.  Nice explanation of the evil that exists in the world.
B004LROUW2|1.0|I made it about 800 pages into this incredibly redundant rant of Mr. Murakami. It was the second book of his I read after Norwegian Wood which was phenomenal. The only reason I'm doing this review is because I believe the 3 1/2 stars it's gotten is so unfair, and will trick another reader to buying it. Rarely do I not finish reading a book, and rarely do I want to put one down and punch the writer in the face. The story was incredibly slow and anticlimactic, forever dragging on with nothing to really say. He has some weird obsession writing pages throughout the book about how ugly his one character Ushikawa was. I got it the first 5x Mr. Murakami... geez! Honestly this 1100 page book needed some serious editing to it, and could have been cut down to 200 pages easily. Holy hell I can't write about how bad this was, and from the same man who wrote the beautiful Norwegian Wood?! Well buyer beware. The people giving this more than one stars are just nostalgic for Mr. Murakami's greatness. I'll give Kafka on the Shore a shot because of the solid reviews, but if that fails I'm abandoning this author.
B00A285OOW|4.0|This is another great  book from Ms.  Gregory. She makes history enjoyable and the character real. If only school books read like this!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is for sure what i do on my spare time when i have nothing to do! It gets you so aggresive to make it to the next level! I 150% reccomend this app for you!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Short and sweet - I couldn't read it when I was alone in the house; I couldn't go into the basement at night;  I'm sorry it's over!  Awesome read!  Stephen King never disappoints!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I'm not an avid reader to say the least but my girlfriends decided to form a book club just for wine drinking and gossip.  I was a bit hesitant at first because I didn't think I had enough time to read let alone do other chores.  But this book was fantastic: it had humor, easy to read, and easy to relate to characters.  I think I read this book in a week or so and I wasn't even trying.<br /><br />The book is written from the perspective of a dog named Enzo and he tells you stories of what is happening to the family that owns him.  It has sad parts and happy parts but it also has humor all over it so get ready to laugh it up, cry it out.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I can't say I had high hopes, but this book was just senseless.  The admittedly dull, uninspiring young woman (who somehow has managed to graduate college without having ever had sex or gotten drunk) is some magnet for an otherwise flawless billionaire?  And when does this guy ever work?  The sex scenes were hot, that was about it.  On the good side, it wasn't completely boring, just extremely unbelievable.
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|If you like a good 3D movie that shows the 3D well then this is great, but only about 4 to 6 really pop outs.
B00628SJJS|5.0|I watched this because I was curious about Rupert Friend movies. Heart wrenching piece of art but a good story about humanity.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Much easier to follow along with when you can see them all in the same week instead of years apart.<br /><br />Heath Ledger totally stole the show.  Best bad guy yet in a Batman movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest .my favorite is the recipes. The picture are awsome. Knowing other people. Have the same interests  that I do. Love it.
B0089LOG02|3.0|The setting and plot thread were interesting, but I felt the writing was more appropriate for a middle-schooler.  And I cannot accept the contrivance of a girl in a small town in Maine being faced with &#34;juvie&#34; for taking an old paperback copy of Jane Eyre from the library. But the orphan train research was educational, the book was very easy to read, and I actually DID want to know how it would play out.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|I say this because reading I Am Pilgrim is like being on the adventure with the characters. The writing is so snappy that I never skipped pages or wished it would hurry up. Definitely can see a film coming from this book, which make sense given the authors background. I was really annoyed when I finished it and will have to read it again. Highly recommended.

B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I wanted to make wine bottle lights for our belly-up tables but I needed to use battery operated lights. I ordered the bottle cutter and finally found an activity that my fiance' could help with! It was easy to use. A few bottles did not cut evenly but we noticed it was the bottles that had uneven surfaces. We scored the bottles lightly only once, dipped it in boiling water, then transferred to bowl of ice water. Some cracked immediately but others required a few back and forths from hot to cold but we were able to do about 10 bottles in under an hour.<br />Now all my friends want to use it so this was well worth the money.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|Living in a townhouse in Southern California is like living in a normal house with your neighbours, and few of mine happen to be quite loud. On top of that my husband snores quite loud, no matter if he is sleeping on his back or his side. Earplugs are no help, so in frustration I started trying white noise apps for my phone. I found one I liked and eventually got addicted. When I left my phone at home during a weekend trip, I downloaded this app onto my kindle, and it helped my through the night at the hotel. Then the app on my phone started malfunctioning after a recent phone upgrade, so once again I turned to my kindle. It took me several times to pinpoint the frequencies on the first page that provide the deep monotones that best block out his snoring, but once I did I was able to combine them with other soothing sounds to block out the world and my husband and finally allow me to sleep again. I don't know where I'd be without this app... maybe an insane asylum?

1594744769|5.0|\\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" is one of those unique books that you will either love or cast aside as being too weird for your taste.  Ransom Riggs has written an original and imaginative, just a bit bizarre, novel that is quite different from run-of-the-mill young adult fiction.<br /><br />It is at the outset of the novel, when Jacob tells the reader \\"...I had just come to accept my life would be ordinary when extraordinary things began to happen ...\\" that one knows the suspense and mystery are just beginning to build.  Combining time-travel, family secrets, and the supernatural, \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" draws the reader into sixteen-year-old Jacob Portman's life and his journey to prove not only his own sanity, but also the truth of his Grandpa Portman's life in and reminisces about the orphanage in Wales and the old photos he has shown Jacob.<br /><br />Jacob's discovery of an abandoned, dilapidated house and his subsequent travel back-and-forth through a time loop are only part of his grandfather's story.  As Jacob becomes familiar with the \\"peculiars\\" and with Miss Peregrine, an aymbryne and headmistress of the orphanage, he also discovers his own peculiar talent and unexpected courage when he faces the hollows, supernatural creatures bent on destroying the \\"peculiars.\\"<br /><br />Riggs' choice of peculiarities provides each character with some unique ability they will effectively employ as part of the story's development.  Using vintage photos as a basis for the \\"peculiar children\\" strengthens the overall novel and is a stroke of genius with respect to illustration.  These photos provide the reader with a clear picture of each of the individual characters as well as emphasizing the time-travel aspect of the story.  They are significantly more effective than a conventional illustration would have been.<br /><br />\\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" is a well-written novel; it is suspenseful and moves rapidly, drawing the reader into the action.  One cares about the characters and the outcome of their conflict with the hollows.  Readers who enjoy unique, imaginative books should add \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" to their \\"must read\\" list.  It is one book I will be keeping for my own library.ng the reader into the action.  One cares about the characters and the outcome of their conflict with the hollows.

B006BFK5DK|5.0|Having grown up with them, Earth, Wind & Fire is one of my favorite groups.  This CD is a bit more eclectic than I expected it to be.  It is R&B heavy for the first half of it, and then a bit more jazzy in the second half of it.  Overall, it plays very well, and Phillip Bailey on lead vocal is just outstanding (as usual).  My only regret was Target selling the same CD with two extra songs on their version only.  I went to Target and purchased that version (a red cover of the same logo).  I wish those two songs had been included on this version as well, they really enhance the CD.  :-(

0439023548|5.0|The Hunger Games series is captivating!  Suzanne Collins offers a unique take on a dystopian society.  The contrast between the technologically advanced Capital and primitive District 12 is striking.

B004V5QWU2|5.0|Sleepy time was worth every penny! I bought this app and have not been disappointed yet!  HUGE selection of sounds (one request please, crackling fireplace?)  They have everything from rain, camping, truck idle, fan sounds, beach, white noise, crickets, laundry noises,  wolves, thunder, snoring! Everything you can imagine. Plus you can blend sounds together to find what you like. There is a timer to shut off sound after so many hours. I had a sound machine, but I gave it away after downloading this app. It's really that good. I sleep great thanks to sleepy time.

B0063IH60K|5.0|If you only have a few minutes to spare, don't open this game<br /> It's like \\"just one more chip\\" as you will find you are barely able to keep your eyes open, but you have to play just one more hand. Love it!
B007JMW46U|5.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes stories.  The original illustrations brought the story to life.  Most of our modern day detective stories are built on the antics and methods of Sherlock Holmes.

1609611543|4.0|Wheat Belly presents great explanations and sound logic for why we should all cut wheat out of our diets.  I have adopted most of the philosophy presented in the book and have lost weight and feel better over all.
B00004YA66|3.0|I didn't care the language.  It is too raw in parts and profane. It offended me.  The story and acting were great; its just the language!  I can't show it to my granddaughter and am not anxious to watch it again.
043902353X|5.0|The Hunger Games series is captivating!  Suzanne Collins offers a unique take on a dystopian society.  The contrast between the technologically advanced Capital and primitive District 12 is striking.  The reader relates to Katniss' fight for survival and her reluctance to be the figurehead of the rebellion.
6305882592|5.0|Truly an interesting movie about an interesting romance that would not have worked with just any Harold or Maude actors.  Very period scenery and props.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|The Maze Runner series is unlike anything I've ever read, with elements of Peter Pan's Lost Boys and a techno-thriller.  It was a great story really enjoyed the unpredictability of it.  The story didn't take the turns I wanted it too, but I still enjoyed the ride.
B001LKQDCM|5.0|Not sure what it is about his CD, but I just love it.  It's been how many years?  And it's still good :-)
B003UMW69I|5.0|Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are a great team!  The story is a perfect balance of sweet and funny.  The story is even somewhat believable since the characters know each other long before the movie starts.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|This is the best book ever written with videogames as a central theme. Ernest Cline knows his videogame history and shows some impressive skill with incorporating this into the narrative. 80's pop culture, music, movies and above all videogame history is woven into «Ready Player One» with such ease that the result is a novel that should hit just the right notes with all people even remotely interested in the subject. This is not a novel about videogames, instead it is a suspense thriller that uses such themes as a narrative foundation for the action. Sublime.
B00AHGSVKS|3.0|Arthur C. Clarke is a classic science fiction author.  I enjoyed the unique presentation of this story.  Some chapters are separated by a span of decades.  Great out of the box thinking in this story.  Lots of themes and ideas have been reused in science fiction since.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|King hasn't written a truly scary novel since «From a Buick 8». Althought «Dr. Sleep» is his best since «11/22/63». It is a far cry from the nerve-wrecking horror that made «The Shinging» shine so bright. That's OK, 'cause King has long since moved on and so has the horror-genre to a certain degree. The novel is always entertaining, but for once King could actually have fleshed out the story some more. It sometimes seems that the author is in a hurry to come to the conclusion. The result is that the ending feels a bit punctured. Sort of a «...and they all lived happily ever after» -kind of outcome.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a great story about two people in rural Ireland.  It was unlike anything I had read before, and kept me guessing as to what would happen next.  It's a sweet story about love and family.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the book!<br />I recommend it to all Stephen King Fans!  He always gives us a ride, through twists & turns..
B002PHVHFI|4.0|I really love this album but my vinyl record came with some problems. It doesn't appear to be scratched but it keeps skipping I don't really know why, I am not a total expert but it hasn't happened to any other record I've played in my player so yeah.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is an awesome game and a must have. I can't wait to see what's new. Graphics and gameplay are smooth.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is fun but there aren't enough levels! Need more levels and it would be nice if it was a bit more interactive.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|Awesome case. Perfect color and fit for iPhone 5. Makes the phone's screen appear bigger once installed. And I like that it does.
B000MCIBAW|5.0|While \\"greatest hits\\" collections cover the wide range of The Doors music, this was one of their best albums. Nearly every cut is a hit - many of which we rarely hear nowadays. This is a group where one should own every album - not just a \\"greatest hits.\\"
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing can not wait till the movie comes out.  If it is even half as good as the book it will blow you away!!
B0000062FL|5.0|If you love Carlos Santana, this album is probably the best he ever produced. There are several of his greatest hits that are on every \\"greatest hits\\" collections; but even the songs that never make those collections were great as well.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Harold's story was so real and palpable. A simple but moving tale of ordinary people with ordinary lives, living with pain, fear and disappointment, just like us all. I rallied for Harold along his pilgrimage and enjoyed experiencing his awakening.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Voyager is definitely up there with TOS in my opinion and kicks the Lame Generation's butt. Janeway is a model of integrity and humanity. I loved watching this series and I already miss it.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|The dvd arrived promptly and was in good condition. A recent rereading of the book, followed by this dvd enhanced the over all experience of this wonderful story. This cast brought their great talents to weaving the spell the author set in motion when she wrote this dramatic novel.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I came back to Stephen King with The Cell. I read all his earlier books until<br />he started with the gunslinger (?) series.<br /><br />I'm very  disappointed in this book.  I won't be looking forward to the next one -<br />as that makes two in a row that I haven't read.  There were no characters that<br />I cared about - very obvious stuff - a rehash of the original - at least as far as<br />I got.  Too bad.<br /><br />Nothing kept me interested in this sequel.  I don't think he wrote it to tell<br />you the truth.  Maybe his family took turns writing sections.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Readers of the previous two trilogy books will not be disappointed.  Ms. Atwood's humor and empathy guide you through a story of how Crake's experiment failed and the human spirit lives on.

B009UX2YAC|1.0|At the time of this writing, I have been playing this game for at least six months. I love it. But, make sure you do not remove from your device because you will loose everything you have earned, (coins, characters, hoverboards, high score, everything) and no way to get it back. That happened to me. I was angry so I stopped playing, until the last update. Now I am in New Orleans for Halloween and I am having fun again working to get everything back. I have been playing for about 2 weeks and now all of a sudden (today October 18th 2013) my Webroot virus scanner scans this app as a threat to my Kindle HD Fire and asks me to remove the app. I don't want anything to happen to my Kindle but, I also don't want to remove the app because all I have worked to get back and paid real money for (zombie Jake). And all this has happened within 5 hours. I was playing with no problems then 5 hours later, all has gone to Hell. I love this game, it is very addictive and worth 5 stars but, with all that is happening I can only give it 1 star. Would give zero stars but, you can't give less than 1.
B005HSL626|5.0|my son and daughter and myself love to play this trying to beat each others high score, we have the one for the Kinect and this one is the same amount of fun for long car rides since u just use your fingers, very fun

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It showed how love can effect your life so much and difficulties of teenagers life. It was a really great book.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Half way through the dvd locked up after 25 minutes I got it playing , No outher dvd did this
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The plot is intriguing it reminds me of the old tv programs that left you with cliff hangers at the end of each episode.  It is intelligent, adult, and sophisticated tv watching.  The characters are great and the actors are awesome.  I can't get enough of it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Want sure if I would, but definitely liked the outside, story line and character  development. How to read more of the same..
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It Is fun you can duck roll and jump look out for the fast subway and you can fly with a jetpack
1595827684|5.0|The book is exactly what I seek for! All the artworks and conceptions of all Mass Effect trilogy, plus the explanations of Casey Hudson and Derek Watts. The book itself is well-made and gorgeous!<br /><br />Is you are a Mass Effect fan and love the universe of the series, is a must have.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really cool. You can make chickens catch on fire. You can challenge mobs of creeper with diamond swords and it is just all around epic.
1439153663|3.0|Two thumbs up for The Kitchen House. I don't have a raving review to post, as so many readers have in the past, but I did enjoy this period piece. I especially appreciated the moments of tenderness some of the characters displayed in the face of the horrors of the time. The author's note at the end was also particularly poignant and will stick with me. In this way, I enjoyed certain small bits more than the story as a whole. What I didn't like was how quickly things developed and occurred throughout the story. I felt like the author had a list of events she wanted to have occur and it detracted from the story since the narrative often rushed from thing to another. I also felt there were far too many characters too keep track of, particularly in the beginning. These things aside though, I enjoyed the novel and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.
B00EAIMGDW|2.0|It's an attractive and polished game,  but actual gameplay pads the puzzle-solving with a lot of tedious walk-and-click busywork which undermines the fun. Could be excellent with slightly tighter design.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Good book.  Been reading this author's work for 35 years.  Love how he does the cameos in his movies.  Who can tell me where he learned that from?  Put the question out there and see who is old enough to know.
B0000067L3|3.0|WHEELS OF FIRE was the third album by rock supergroup Cream. Over their brief existence, the trio of Eric Clapton (guitar), Jack Bruce (bass) and Ginger Baker (drums) had dazzled both the record-buying audience and live audiences, and this 1968 release tries to present both facets of their art by containing both nine new songs put down in the studio and four live performances from San Francisco's Fillmore and Winterland venues.<br /><br />I cherish Cream's second album [[ASIN:B0000067L2 Disraeli Gears]] as one of the greatest rock albums of all time and a landmark of the psychedelic era, but the studio portion of this follow-up doesn't impress me all that much. Eschewing the psychedelic production of DISRAELI GEARS, the music here tends to be straight-up blues rock. Indeed, two tracks, \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" and \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" are tracks by traditional bluesmen that Clapton decided to take up. Three other tracks are oddball songs that are essentially the band goofing off, though at times the instrumental performances within aren't entirely uninteresting. The production is also not very kind to Ginger Baker: the finest moments of this first rock drumming virtuoso are very low in the mix, making them hard to appreciate. The opening and closing songs of the studio portion, \\"White Room\\" and \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\", are the only ones that call me back again and again.<br /><br />The live portion does a better job of showing the immense skill of these three musicians, given as they are to long jams (two of the tracks are over 16 minutes long). Though a blues classic written by Robert Johnson in 1936, \\"Crossroads\\" is utterly transformed here, ditto for Willie Dixon's \\"Spoonful\\". \\"Toad\\" has contributions from all three band members, but is best remembered for Ginger Baker's long drum solo.<br /><br />Taking both sides together based on my own experience, I cannot give WHEELS OF FIRE more than an average rating. However, if you are a fan of blues rock, you are likely to get a lot more out of it than I did.you are likely to get a lot more out of it than I did.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I will miss reading about Sookie and all her adventures. I wish this was not the last book. I really liked the book and the end is as it should be, but I had hoped from something different.
B00008OE4W|5.0|Sneakers is one of my many favorite movies. Robert Redford and many of the cast members are also among the top entertainers on my favorites list.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Works great. It really makes a different in the picture quality. It is easy to put on and take off.
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|This movie now ranks of one of my favorite movies.  &#34;Keep the Lights on&#34; is a movie between two gay men but it is not your usual gay, cliched movie.  This movie was about the relationship between two men who were in love and about thier trials and tribulations as they try to make thier relationship work.  No matter how much you love someone, you cannot save them. Sometimes it is better to just walk away.  Bravo to both the lead actors and to the director.  I am now a fan of Thure Lindhardt.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|can be fun to help little kids be entertained.  was unclear on some of the game.  but not addictive like candy crush.  fun and simple
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an amazing book, such inspiration and heart ache. Not the basic happy ending but none the less. I kinda feel like Hazel now with knowing how's Anna's mother, except how's Anna? What happens to Hazel?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was so good to continue the story of Dan Torrence.  Let's hope the next sequel comes a little sooner and continues the story of Abra whom I adored.  Stephen King is my all time favorite writer and Doctor Sleep is one of his best.  Loved it!
B00DOPEGAS|1.0|This was a total piece of junk that shouldn't be allowed to be sold. Impossible for a child to work. Went out and bought Rainbow Loom...great !
B009RX7IX8|4.0|This series is often a little humorous and the characters seem to be having fun in spite of dealing with some really mean folks. Maybe I'll have to read at least one of &#34;Richard Castle's&#34; books one of these days. I would be interested in knowing who actually writes them.
B000FA675C|4.0|I decided I wanted to read this book after seeing the movie.  I was not disappointed.  Very fast paced.  Think about it--the main characters do not sleep during the course of this book!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|With lots of drama like the first two seasons, every episode had me looking forward to the next. However, there were a few events and/or actions taken by the characters that were predictable. I guess that's to be expected by the third season of a show though. For me the important thing is that every episode kept me fully engaged and had me looking forward to the next.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Was looking for the unedited (original) version of the disc and found it (god forbid there's a gay slur on a cd these days, Picture to Burn for those curious).

B006JPS1OM|5.0|Not sure why there were so many reviews about frozen screens. I had no issues.Really fun and an outstanding mystery. If I were to have anything to say , I wasn't able to read all the screens because the screen changed too quickly.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|I'm going to keep this review very brief and just say that the final season of Spartacus is a truly bittersweet one.  After the somewhat uneven \\"Vengeance\\" I was glad to see \\"War of The Damned\\" end the series back on a really high note.  Given the way everything ultimately played out though (not that we didn't know it was coming) it was really emotional to witness so many of the characters I had come to love see their final end.  My hats off to STARZ and the creative team behind the Spartacus series who really elevated the material to must see entertainment.  Both Andy Whitfield and Liam McIntire truly excelled at portraying Spartacus-each in his own unique way.  Andy will always be the original and was sorely missed when he passed away, but Liam having had some giant shoes to fill-stepped in and ultimately hit his own stride.  I will miss this show and all the great and supremely memorable characters it introduced.  Likewise, I will miss the intricate scheming plots of the first couple of seasons and the insane over the top warrior fighting scenes from the later ones.  (Not to mention the gratuitous sex and violence)  So long Spartacus!  You will be missed.<br /><br />PS: If you are sitting the fence on whether to get the Blu Ray or the DVD, my advice is to pay the extra and get the Blu Ray.  This show is drop dead GORGEOUS on Blu Ray.

B000OHZJLY|5.0|Costello wanted his music to be as complex as his lyrics (which increasingly documented marital tension). So for his seventh album he and Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick experimented with an adult sonic palette (accordions, Mellotron, horns) that highlighted grown-up stress and sorrow.
159514188X|5.0|This book is life-changing and eye-opening. It's also really sad, so be prepared to cry. A lot. Thirteen Reasons Why is one of my favorite books now.
B000000OPV|5.0|Gabriel got funky on the 1982 single &#34;Shock the Monkey&#34;. It took him four years to follow up, but So delivered with the visceral &#34;Sledgehammer&#34;, the upbeat &#34;Big Time&#34;, the Gothic love ballad &#34;In Your Eyes&#34; and the inspirational &#34;Don't Give Up&#34;, a duet with Brit art thrush Kate Bush.

B000PC1JKS|5.0|As the title suggests, this album wasn't recorded in Jamaica: after Marley took a bullet in a 1976 assassination attempt, hre relocated the Wailers to London. But tracks such as &#34;Jamming&#34; and &#34;Three Little Birds&#34; are still suffused with the deep essence of riggae and life at home.
B005721Y7Y|4.0|Shame it took me 14 years to watch this flick. I've missed out. Loved the multi-dimensional characters and the quirky narrative around the plot.
B00005KB9X|5.0|The first Wailers album to give Marley top billing was multifaceted rebel music-from the call-to-arms opening, &#34;Lively Up Yourself&#34; (about dancing or revolution or both), to the gospel-flavored &#34;No Woman, No Cry,&#34; an anthem of struggle and hope.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|then watch this movie... everything sucked: acting, storyline, and especially the special effects! Will Smith must've been very desperate or owed someone a big favor? what a waste of money!

B001BKTEZA|4.0|This book expresses the life of the poor as they try to find work and sustenance by moving west. The characters are strong and never give up hope, but I found the story to be quite depressing. Greed of the property owners and bad luck seem to follow the Goad family everywhere they go. Some real connections to life today if you are struggling to manage to survive. A classic story of the human condition.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|The more people who read this the better.  Are we too far gone already?  This book is a good little fairy tale, without a happy ending.
B00BB8Q13A|5.0|I loved it. I was under a lot of stress the past few weeks and needed something to get my mind off my personal issues. It was the best therapy session!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed this read very much.  It is an accurate, historical account of the orphan trains with a story that will keep your attention.  I must admit I did not know anything about the orphan trains, so it was an educational read for me.  It was well researched, and the story captivating.  I would highly recommend this book.

B000UX6OHK|5.0|It's a very nice watch. She gets comments on how thin it is. The band is metal, unlike a lot of the other swatches, which is the reason i bought this watch. When i received, the box was really big and the watch itself had fallen out of the case and was sliding around in the bottom of the box. Then it cracked like 2 weeks later. Not the watches fault, probably the vendor who shipped it poorly. Awesome watch though.<br /><br />The face will get scratched up because it's plastic. The stainless band will get scratched as with any watch you wear all the time.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Decent storyline, not a typical romance novel, easy light reading. Kept me intrigued and wanting to know how the story ends.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|The truth about carbohydrates is finally starting to get some traction, and I cannot imagine anyone more uniquely qualified to explain it to the masses than Dr. Perlmutter. He does a brilliant job of detailing how our bodies process the foods we eat and how our diet contributes to a variety of neurological conditions and our overall health- and he backs up his conclusions with more than 250 references to respected scientific publications and peer-reviewed research.<br /><br />I get the sense from his writing that Dr. Perlmutter is genuinely passionate about our health and really wants to turn around the disturbing rise in obesity, diabetes, and dementia in this country. He provides some practical steps we can all take to improve our health and reduce our chances for a variety of conditions. He and his wife even assembled a variety of easy and delicious recipes to help with the transition. There are a lot of supplements to take, however, which can get expensive. The way I see it, it's got to be cheaper than treating diabetes.<br /><br />So my wife and I immediately started incorporating many of the changes to our lifestyle that he recommends, and we have never felt better. I have already lost 5 pounds in the three weeks since we started. I am sleeping better. I no longer feel bloated. My energy level is consistent all day. My hunger level has dramatically reduced and productivity has increased because I'm not getting up for snacks all the time. I no longer feel the need to nap during the afternoon. I have also noticed my focus has improved somewhat, I am definitely getting more done. The occasional numbness and tingling in my hands and feet is gone, along with the inflammation that was causing it.<br /><br />We did not go cold turkey on the gluten free right away, it has been a gradual process and we keep finding foods in our pantry that we overlooked. So far the gluten free substitutes we have found for our favorite products have been pretty good. The transition to gluten free / low carb is definitely a huge shift in our lifestyle and more challenging than I expected. But the potential payoff is huge, and we can already feel the benefits starting to kick in.<br /><br />I have to thank Dr. Perlmutter and his team for putting this out there. It is a bold move with so much of our economy dependent upon cheap processed grain products and sugary snacks/drinks. Critics, powerful agencies/organizations, and \\"flat-earther nutritionists\\" whose livelihoods depend on the products and old long-held beliefs will no doubt try to discredit the science behind this book and attack Dr. Perlmutter himself. It will be fascinating to see how this plays out.<br /><br />-- Update 3/6/14 --<br /><br />It has been about five months now since I started this, and so I thought I would post a quick update. My wife and I have stayed on the program pretty consistently but we do indulge in carbs and wheat products every couple of weeks or so for birthdays and other special occasions. We both feel great and I have lost 33 pounds so far. I am now able to work out 6 days a week for 30-45 minutes at a time and I have plenty of energy throughout the day. I have added weight training to my routine and I am now lifting more than when I was in my twenties. In fact, I had to upgrade my Bowflex with an additional 100lbs because I have outgrown the factory set of resistance rods.<br /><br />We continue to enjoy the benefits I outlined in my original review, but there are a few new and unexpected effects that I have observed. First, my sleep feels very deep and when I wake up I feel much more rested and refreshed that before. Another surprise for me was a tingly toe that I've had for years now feels normal again. I think it may have been a pinched nerve somewhere caused by my excess weight or perhaps inflammation. I was convinced that was going to be with me for life, but it's completely gone now.<br /><br />Perhaps the most surprising thing is, at least for me, is thatpeople are telling me how awesome my skin looks. I've noticed it too, my skin actually looks and feels younger and healthier. My wife too, she's absolutely thrilled about this unexpected benefit. I'm not sure if it's the supplements, the diet, or the exercise, but wow what a difference this had made in our overall quality of life. I highly recommend this book, it's truly a game-changer.people are telling me how awesome my skin looks. I've noticed it too, my skin actually looks and feels younger and healthier.

B00BWQW73E|4.0|This is a well written business biography that includes many details about Amazon's growth.  Brad Stone describes Jeff Bezos as a guy who just knew, from the very start, that he could do something that changed the way Americans bought things, and not just books.  Bezos started on Wall Street as an investment banker, but he had the heart of an entreprenuer and knew when to jump at that astonishing innovation, the internet.<br /><br />Given the subject this book was destined to be a hit.  Stone describes the way that many Amazon innovations came about including customer reviews, author and book rankings and fast shipping.  He describes the early days of ordering and the painful growth that companies go through when they need more experienced talent, and must choose between the old employees who made them succeed and new employees who can help them grow.  Bezos realized early on that he had a massive distribution challenge.  To meet that challenge he hired the masters of distribultion...at Walmart.  Its not always a pretty story, but its one that many business students will recognise--despite Bezos invention of a brand new business.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book as a business biography, but not as much as I expected to. What's missing is the magic, the crazy stories, the sheer fun of innovation.  Amazon started in the book business, not home goods or auto parts but you wouldn't know it to read much of this book.  Stone doesn't seem to have found many people with good stories to tell.<br /><br />Stone misses what made Amazon such a revelation and why the other websites could not compete.  Amazon created not just a big bookstore, but a real online community bookstore.  For the first time people who loved book shopping more than anything could do it from home.  In 1998 Amazon was my home page.  Why?  I just loved browsing.  I could not believe that I could do it from home.  Millions of people, just like me, did the same thing.  It seemed incredible, still does, that I could browse a website the way I browse in a bookstore.  Not only that, I could have conversations with other booklovers about the books.<br /><br />Maybe Bezos loved that too.  I have no idea because The Everything Store boils that kind of thing down to \\"caring about customers\\" and an \\"obsession with customer service.\\"  Its a shame.  There was a lot more to Amazon's growth than customer service (fast delivery and a generous return policy) and good distribution, though those things were important.  There was also the joy of being able to access thousand and thousands of books--and talk about them.  For those addicted to the New York Times Book section Amazon was an undreamed of luxury.<br /><br />And once there was Kindle, the joy of being able to download sample after sample, to find the perfect book, just made everything better.<br /><br />Yes, I've bought all kinds of things through Amazon, clothing, appliances, cookware, even household goods for my child in college, but Amazon will always be a bookstore to me first.<br /><br />This is a good book, no question.  But something tells me that the really great Jeff Bezos book, has yet to be written.uld browse a website the way I browse in a bookstore.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|I purchased this book because I enjoyed her other two books (&#34;Gone Girl&#34; and &#34;Dark Places&#34;). I was not disappointed! The writing is not quite on par with her later books, but I still highly recommend this. Ms. Flynn has a wonderfully descriptive writing style and is enjoyable to read, and her characters are always well developed and complex. I AM A FAN!!!
B007XIC1GI|1.0|But I just couldn't. In fact, I downright detested it. I completed it just in case I found anything redeeming about Manson. An I'm sad to say, there was no redemption. I wasn't really a fan of his, but I did like a few songs- now I can't even stomach them. And I'm all for shock-rock. I'm totally in love with Alice Cooper, but I'm sorry, I just could not like this book
B007IV11PM|5.0|Love love love this season.  It took me a little while to get used to the eleventh doctor but by the end of this season I kinda like him. Amy is my favorite though.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|If you have read the series in the order that it was written you may agree with me that this one got off to a slow start.  I will not reveal nay of its highlights but will say the author did a great job of tying up the loose ends.  It has  agreat ending that I am not sure will do as well on the big screen as it does in the book.
B008Y7J91M|4.0|I'm reading &#34;The Jane Austin Book Club&#34; and wanted a quick review of some of her novels.  While no movie ever does full justice to the book, &#34;Mansfield Park&#34; sets the tone for my dipping into the period. Austin's examination of the privileges and privations of class and gender distinction, as well as the beautiful &#34;eye-candy&#34; of costumes and settings strongly evokes the England of her day.
0399162097|5.0|I read this novel, from cover to cover, with a sense of excitement. Fowler takes a number of risks -- from her story's structure, to the story content, to the characters she creates -- setting up anticipation about how she is going to resolve all these elements. I loved the complexity, the ideas she and the characters play with, and going along for the ride. Highly recommend, if you like smart books.
B0019TYQ38|5.0|Looking for a quick review of Austin's novel, I was charmed by this fabulous cast! Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant...It just doesn't get any better than this!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good book. What I loved about it was the protagonist because of his point of view. He was just a little crazy and it was kept you laughing throughout the book. But I also loved how he found his way and came to terms with how his life was going.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|At this time I only recommend this if you don't mind fiddling with technology and/or you think that $35 sounds good compared to $50-$150 for a Roku or similar device.<br /><br />WHO I AM:<br /><br />This review will focus on my use of Chromecast.  Chromecast features will change over time (usually for the better). Look for up to date product details elsewhere.  I'm a techie but I don't spend much money on technology and I have little patience for bugs or bad design.<br /><br />HOW I USE OR HAVE TRIED TO USE THE CHROMECAST:<br /><br />> Sony Bravia TV.  I recently configured the TV to turn on and change the input automatically when I play something.  Cool feature.  It's too bad I still have to turn off the TV manually.<br /><br />> Netflix - I love that I can start a show from either my laptop or my Android phone.<br /><br />If I'm doing chores around the house I sometimes start a show from my phone and swap playback between the phone and the TV.  This usually works fine but sometimes the playback jumps backward by a few minutes.  This should work from a laptop too but...<br /><br />My laptop almost always loses its connection to the Chromecast during playback after a few minutes.  The Netflix page says to refresh the browser window but that rarely fixes it. (For what it's worth, I'm running Windows 8 with an Airport Extreme.)<br /><br />My Android phone seems to automatically close the Netflix app after 20 minutes of inactivity.  So if I'm watching a show I often have to restart Netflix on my phone and wait for it to reconnect to Chromecast before I can pause or select another show.  I imagine I would have heard more about this if it were widespread.  Therefore, I suspect that iPhones, iPads, and some other Android devices do not have this problem.<br /><br />Picture quality for Netflix is excellent.<br /><br />> Amazon Instant Video - Unsupported.<br /><br />> Google Music - Playback from my Android phone works flawlessly.  Playback from my laptop requires the music to go from the Internet to my laptop then to my Chromecast. This gobbles my laptop battery so I don't do it.<br /><br />> Spotify - Unsupported.<br /><br />> YouTube - Nice!  I think this is the best way to watch YouTube.  You can queue videos for playback and continue to browse the web as a video is playing. Unfortunately, the interface for adding a video to the queue is confusing.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Had it for less than a month and it fell from my car to the floor and totally shattered the front and back of the phone.  Called amazon to cover the phone because it is a &#34;LifeProof&#34; case and their answer to me was they would only replace the case not the phone.  What is the point of spending all that money on case that does not protect the phone. Very dissatisfied and disappointed with the case and with Amazon for not backing up their product.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This is a great movie for the entire family. Love it, just as good as the other two in this trilogy. Glad all the same actors as in the rest. Nice price too!

0375869026|5.0|I can honestly say that it has been a long time since I read a book for any age level that was as inspiring and touching as Wonder. I sent it to  my adult children, who were also profoundly moved. Palacios has taken an embarassing episode in her past and transformed it into an affirmation of life and of the underlying goodness in the human spirit.
0425263908|5.0|After reading 50 shades of grey, I never thought I would find an adult romance novel that was as good as it, until I read the \\"bared to you\\" Series!!! These are the best books I've ever read! I can guarantee you will be flipping pages, unable to put the book down!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|First time stephen king has written a sequel to a character. Found my first king novel in my high school library. Been hooked on his work since. As always the best writer ever
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Good movie. Pretty creepy at times. A must watch movie at night with popcorn and family alongside. You will jump out of your seat :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved catching up with Danny! I missed him! It was like finding an old friend! And I love that he connected the true knot (a little) to another of his books.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Awesome movie! Fantastic combination of the super hero stories. Very entertaining, even if you're not a comic book geek! I highly recommend!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play this one a lot. It is nice to be able to choose a winning hand, which I win about 80% of the time.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like that this game has variety. You can solve mini puzzles instead of just hidden objects. Each scene can be played again and again and still feel new.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I have watched this several times and just love it.  I can't wait for the next movie.  J Lawrence is a fabulous actress and I hope we continue to see  more of her.

B004EBZX6W|4.0|Nice program to test reception of your equipment at different locations.  Easy to use and gives the option of a Not having ads for a small one time fee of $.99.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|As always James Rollins has written another great book in his Sigma series. Looking forward to the next one in the sigma series.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|A true work of art.  This raises the bar for all future literature and challenges every one of us to be a better person right to the core.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Got this game as a free app of the day and it is a bit challenging due to time constraints.  Took over three hours to play one of the two modes; not a brain game, but a good time passer.
044024238X|4.0|I liked this book and was so happy to see Samantha come to her senses and end up with a great guy. The whole story is pretty funny though when you envision her messing up sandwiches and burning food. I thought there was going to be some huge debacle behind where the Geiger's got their money bc that still wasn't clear on that. They just didn't seem like the type who were refined enough to have that kind of money, lol. It was awesome that the Geiger's niece got an attitude adjustment in the end when she found out who Samantha really was - loved that! Overall a super fun read and kept my interest.....I'm considering trolling through some nearby neighborhoods looking for my Nathaniel! LOL!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|When I saw the preview for this movie, I thought it was going to be alright, just entertaining. However, I never thought that it would be so intriguing. The ending is fabulous! Never saw it coming. I've seen movies where the plot builds up deliciously but the ending blows. This is not one of those movies. Great film.
0316056871|2.0|Not my humor unfortunately - I had friends recommend this that were cracking up remembering different lines etc. The way they shared the stories was funnier than the actual book. I tried to force myself to finish it but eventually just gave up. Sorry Tina Fey, I like you but this was a major flop.
B00CL151G4|5.0|I've read some of the original Sherlock Holmes written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Decades ago, I watched Basil Rathbone as Sherlock on one of the early black and white TVs long before color; in recent years I walked to the local theater to see the films starring Robert Downey Jr.--movies easily forgotten a few hours later but enjoyed for the cheap thrills--and a few months ago I watched the new BBC TV series of Sherlock staring Benedict Cumberbatch and enjoyed that.<br /><br />But now \\"Elementary\\" with Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu has spoiled all of the other versions for me, because they pale in comparison to this duo. This Holmes and Watson are more complex, more compelling and more delicious. I am now addicted to them as if they were cocaine, chocolate, tobacco, caffeine and even sugar all rolled into one.<br /><br />And this compulsion has nothing to do with the fact that my wife and I are both fans of Lucy Liu.  It has to do with the development of the complex plots, the characters and the platonic relationship that develops between this new Holmes and Watson.<br /><br />I also can't recall having ever seen Lucy Liu cast outside the Asian femme-fatale stereotype before, but now I have seen her talent as an actor as I have never seen it before. She takes the dullness out of Watson; lights a flame under him and propels him into orbit.<br /><br />This Watson is more complex and much more interesting. Whoever thought of the idea of Dr. Watson as a woman--a Chinese-American woman at that--was a pure genius. And we can't blame Arthur Conan Doyle because in those days women were the property of men equal to a stove or a couch. Even pigs and cows were probably considered more valuable than women in that era.<br /><br />In addition, the new Holmes is better than the original. This Holmes is so extreme and out-of- this-world that he jumps off the screen and into your imagination like crazy glue and sticks.<br /><br />The only thing I regret is that I have to wait for maybe a year or more before I can buy and watch the DVDs for the second season, because I don't watch TV with commercials--I fall asleep.<br /><br />Like an addict, I will be desperate for my next fix of this magical reincarnation.  And it is \\"Elementary\\" that I may watch the first season again and then maybe again ... while I'm waiting.<br /><br />I itch to say more about this TV series but know that if I do, I may give away too many delightful surprises and spoil the experience for others.<br /><br />For me, five-stars are not enough. I want to give ten, and I've never read, listened to or watched anything that made me feel that way before--even \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" that I've read and watched three times. Of course, this is my opinion--that \\"Elementary\\" is the Rembrandt [Lucy Liu] and Picasso [Jonny Lee Miller] of the Sherlock Holmes world. My only worry is that the writers of this show will not be able to live up to the first season.<br /><br />I bought the first season of \\"Elementary\\" on DVDs at Costco.

B00003CXCT|5.0|always 5 stars...packaging and DVDs received as expected and indicated in the description.  Great set to get for any newbies, since this is the original, widescreen.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Great movie. All the sci-fi and action I love in a movie. Good story line and kept me interested. Grab a good bowl of popcorn, your favorite swisher-downer and pull up a comfy seat for this one ...
B003G4W49C|5.0|i picked this up in anticipation of the movie, then did some research, largely considered to be one of the best scify books every written.  Don't disagree, keeping scify separate from fantasy.  moved onto Dune.  great book, does have some mean stuff happening to young kids...but not gruesome or anything, great book - buy it
B0035LMTZA|4.0|It was a good movie but Ocean's 11 was better than this one... By the way Mark  Wahlberg is a boss.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|different way of story telling, a bit more realistic - easy to read and follow, nice flow.  Not too violent or racy, appropriate for kids - imho
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it! It works just like on my iPhone. Couldn't be better. The only thing I hate is you only get so many lives til you have to wait for so many minutes
B009XIXVU6|5.0|One of my favorite aspects of this book is that it shares the story from multiple perspectives. It is a reminder that in life, everyone has their own view on what is happening, why it is happening, and what it means to them. Remembering there are always multiple perspectives is such an important aspect of living in this world with empathy and openness to others.<br />I highly recommend this book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|A well designed application that pairs well with Pandora when using the &quot;Launch Application&quot; Function for an alarm. I highly recommended this to those who wish to wake to their favorite music.
0446556750|5.0|This was another magnificent entry in the series of both Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller, and I loved it. \\"The Reversal\\" is just as good as \\"The Brass Verdict\\", which is the other Haller/Bosch novel I recently read. I listened to this book on audio, and as always with Bosch/Haller narrations, the reading was excellent, filled with emotion, and really contributed to the energy of the story. As opposed to \\"The Brass Verdict\\", where Haller and Bosch spent their time butting heads with one another, this novel features the two of them working side by side, which is an intersting, refreshing change. They both have such strong personalities, things are far from smooth, but their passion for doing the right thing and seeing it through unites them. The plot is fast paced and engaging, featuring a diabolical villain that I just loved to hate- and I couldn't wait to see how the half-brothers would put him in his place. Connelly utilizes his trademark misdirection, leading me on an adventure that I failed to predict, and I was thrilled with the conclusion. HIGHLY recommended to any fan of Bosch and/or Haller.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Keeps pace with the first book.  Ended as a character has evolved well.  Strong social and political overtones set to a great science fiction scape. Any sci fi fan will more than enjoy.
B000BISBDY|4.0|This is a good album for any Johnny Cash CD.  I'm a real Johnny Cash fan and I'm sure that when I play this CD and learn the songs that I will grow to love this one.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Very entrrtaining! Chris hemworth is riveting and a great march with Natalie Portman! Special effects are also nicely done! Highly recommend it if you like superhero movies!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|When I saw the previews, I decided then that I was not interested.  However, my son rented it and I ended up on the couch watching part of it with him.  Then, I couldn't wait for the weekend to watch it in its entirety.  Lots of action, some good jump scenes, and a mystery to be solved.  You will like it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I liked the book's from the beginning. I hate the ending.  so will be in line for the next one.

B00ET7INY0|5.0|This is just good music!  My only disappointment, if I had to name one, might be the version of Wooly Bully, but overall just a superb live album with a Mexican influence. Many of Ry's older chestnuts appear and are a credit to all concerned. Highly recommended if you are at all familiar with this man and his music.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Ellen writes a fun and amusing book that is a nice, light read when you want to escape. Very humorous and very Ellen.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|After days and days which quickly turned to weeks and  more weeks I have sadly come to the end of the first books.  I feel like the characters have become family. I now look forward to to the final book.  I can only hope that it is as entertaining as the first four!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Liked it. I liked the plot twists. Not sure what the target audience is but it seemed to be for young adults
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I'm not much of a book reviewer. In fact my reading ranges from serious topics like money theory and politics to pulpy Horor story's and popular works like the hunger games.<br /><br />I'm no fing critic. But as an avid Stephan King reader, I found this book to be one of the most engaging I've read from him in years. It's no Pulitzer Prize winning material certainly, but as as a sequel  to one of his most scary story's, it just works.<br /><br />The bad guys are scary enough and evil enough,yet somehow still garner a sense of sympathy to their plight. The adult Danny is well thought out and believable as a character.  I dock a star for the ending as it is is the typical ending of a great battle of good vs evil we see in so many King works. But it was definitely engaging. I read the story in pretty much a 24 hour period as I could not put it down. For a so called retired writer King is still putting out some major works. I hope he can keep it up.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great book. No character is sacred. This allows for true suspense and emotion as you connect with the characters. Great read
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|I just down loaded Fortress and I can not stop playing it.  I think it is the best Alter Bridge album (yes I still say album) of them all.  It is very heavy but radio friendly at the same time.  This is a contender for best hard rock album of the year! So do yourself a favor and buy it!<br /><br />  Dano
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This is an amazing look at Pink Floyd!  It's not only them performing at Pompeii them just hanging out.  A must buy/see for any Floyd fan!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Not quite done but really enjoying the read.  Wish it was longer! Or there was another one.  Excellent!  One of my favorites over the last few years!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I absolutely loved this story!  Classic King.  It made me want to go back and read The Shining again!  Another thumbs up to my favorite author.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't believe this wish came true so it's a good awesome game and have harder level that I thought
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|This is one of those literary novels that mostly makes you think the author's done better work in the past.  Like some of the later John Irving novels I've read it's not completely awful, but there isn't much impact to it.  It certainly doesn't surpass Ford's Pulitzer-winning \\"Independence Day.\\"<br /><br />Basically in 1960 Dell Parson's parents rob a bank in North Dakota to pay off some Native Americans.  The most implausible part is that no one takes the kids when the parents are arrested; they're just left there to fend for themselves even though they're 15.  I don't think that would happen even in 1960 in a small Montana town.  Most likely they'd have gone to the police station until a social worker could take them to an orphanage.  But anyway, the book is called Canada because Dell ends up in Saskatchewan, in an even worse town than the one in Montana.<br /><br />The idea of fleeing to Canada to start a new life would have had a lot more impact back in 1968 or so with the Vietnam War in full swing and people going to Canada to avoid the draft.  In 2013 it comes off as quaint.<br /><br />It's one of those novels too where the author uses a narrator who is probably the least interesting character in the book.  This only works when the characters around that character are far more interesting, which is just not the case here. (It's the case in [[ASIN:B002B56CRW Where You Belong (None)]])<br /><br />Anyway, for what it is the book is well written, but it really felt to me like a book out of time.  I suspect the only reason the book takes place so long in the past is that's the time period the author is familiar with as a teenager.  I think we're about at the point where a book taking place in 1960 would be considered \\"historical fiction\\" akin to a book about Henry VIII.  Sorry, septuagenarian authors but your golden days of yore are ancient history.<br /><br />That is all.

B005LHOKFS|1.0|It simply does not work on my Kindle.  I input the info and get an error message, over and over again.  It's worth exactly what you pay for it.
B00578FKVE|5.0|Great TV show. To bad there were not more seasons and or more shows like this. All the good syfy get the axe to soon. People need to look at these shows for being syfy and not real life and stop the &#34; its not realistic&#34; crap.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|While I may not like Jeff Bezos as a person he seems to be driven, obsessed, and relentless in his vision for his fledgling company. Kudos to the author for giving us a glimpse into the struggles, challenges, and obstacles in Bezos path to fame and fortune. I have been an Amazon consumer for a long while and I am writing this review on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 which is now my third Kindle. Amazon still delivers high quality , incomparable depth, and superior pricing. I also have an IPad and I use it as much as I use my Kindle. The apps on IPad for Instant Video and Cloud Player from Amazon are top-notch and I expect nothing less. I remain loyal to Amazon and am glad this book was so well written. Some insight into  Jeff Bezos  was much appreciated.
B000002GB2|5.0|This CD is arguably the best CD Styx ever recorded.  I am from the 70's and am very pleased with purchase. I do plan on purchasing more CD's from Amazon if I am unable to find them at the Exchange stores.  Exchange has a lot of old CD's, in perfect condition, for $2.50-$4.00.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Very good reading, captivated me from the start.  Stephen King did it again. I would recommend it for sure. L
B000068FXX|5.0|This Supertramp CD along with their 'Crisis What Crisis?' CD are incredible.  The best two CD's they ever produced in my opinion.  Could not be happier.
0807014265|5.0|Well written on an important subject. Book raises questions that each of us need to consider. A must read by all.
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|Classic Stephen King - enough chills and bumps in the night but some real warmth in the writing and obviously a very mature writer. Some passages that really pull on the heartstrings. Only criticism I had was that the end felt a little rushed and anticlimactic.<br /><br />Overall a good solid read and highly recommended...
0307454568|4.0|I am currently reading the book and like it.  Just takes awhile because it is so long (but good) and I need to, at times, read something relaxing and calming.
0553573403|5.0|This series is Lord of the Rings on steroids!  I have read all 5 books and the last one has left me hanging like never before.  I can hardly wait on book 6!  I have watched a few HBO episodes, but there is no comparison.  I don't like  how my favorite characters die and the good guys don't always prevail!!  It is a dynamic read--you won't regret it.
B0035QA3M6|5.0|Downey well deserved the accolades he received for this performance. A generation of people grew up unaware of Chaplin's English accent simply because they never heard The Little Tramp speak. The impact he had on the industry is difficult to overstate, and Downey's portrayal was beautifully nuanced and true to the man. For an actor who had since earned a reputation for excesses of ego and other questionable behaviors, this early performance in his career is exceptional in its virtually complete sublimation of the actor in favor of the character.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read this book and feel that Ms Collins has written a riveting trilogy.  The only failure of this work will be the lack of transference of the thoughts of these many characters to the movie screen.  I would like to offer Ms Collins a warm thank you for letting me participate in the Hunger Games.
B00BU18U82|4.0|really enjoy this game! I have not played the pc version so can not compare. I would give this game a 5 star  rating except for the problem with the driving controls.  For starters I cannot drive by tilting the device as it instructs in the manual. Also the control slides &quot;stick&quot;  and it is next to impossible to drive the tractors when that happens.  But I like the game enough to keep coming back to play!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Anything with Maggie Smith is divine and \\"Quartet is no exception.<br />A delicious, witty and warm screen play filled with special moments and the best of the best of both stars and fine character actors of a certain age.<br />If you're over fifty and perhaps beyond, you will absolutely love this well made,well designed,well photographed A-list film. Ms Smith is, as always,  spot-on perfect. A lovely and thought provoking evening's entertainment.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|In my opinion there is only one reason to own this release.  That is for the epic A Day In The Life which is unhampered here by the applause that runs off the end of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise) and into the beginning of this tune.  You get to hear it clean.  Does it justify forking over the dough to buy an entire album?  That's for the consumer to decide.  It is a good collection.
0399165274|4.0|this is a very quickly paced, well plotted yarn based on terrorism in 2013.  islamist extremists have continued to launch various terrorist attacks.  one of the most successful is a man called the PREACHER who has sermons he posts on the internet.  he takes a different thrust from other terrorists.  he exhorts this young men to do one act of jihad, killing themselves at the end of it as part of the terrorist act.  so these men assassinate ordinary citizens in the UK and USA who offend their muslim sensibilities.  as the bodies begin mounting, the TRACKER is brought into play.  he has to find this terrorist and eliminate him.  plenty of military savvy will be needed to bring this about as the PREACHER keeps himself well surrounded in a fortress like setting.  a simple air strike will take out many civilians including women, children and in place agents on the ground.  thus he must be eliminated in person.<br /><br />i know nothing about the military but i found the technical stuff in here very fascinating.  we are given very precise detail on everything needed to bring about this mission.  for example, there is a UK unit called the Pathfinders.  these soldiers parachute in virtually anywhere to do this kind of mission.  this is a fascinating unit and we got all the details on it.  i even loved their expensive french parachutes.  we also see up close and personal a hijacking of a swedish ship by somali pirates which eventually intersects with the PREACHER. i had heard of the Somali pirates but i never knew any details.  this is fascinating to read as well.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B008JFUR10|4.0|The reviews were not kind when Pacific Rim came to theaters.  I rented this, however, and was thoroughly entertained.  The characters are all likeable and easy to watch.  I liked it enough to see it twice in a row.  It has an imaginative plot and nonstop action.  I didn't even mind the somewhat silly subplot about two nerdy scientists.  It gave a break to the intensity of the fight scenes.  But I do wish that directors would stop filming in the dark.  I had trouble following some of the scenes because I could not really see what was going on.  Surely some of the action could have taken place in daylight....
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love this book awesome 2 nd half to the shinging its like it picked up right were the other book left off its a great read and i would totally recommend it if you liked the first book
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use.  I can see the numbers much easier.  It is simple to use and anyone can use it.
B00EMQJ6XU|5.0|TO CATCH A THIEF is a most entertaining and classic film from director Alfred Hitchcock. Cary Grant is brilliantly charming as John Robie the infamous and former jewel thief. Is Grace Kelly going to be his next target? Their moments together on the screen create fireworks of emotion. Someone is copying John Robie's style as the famous cat burglar and there it is.  And then there is John Williams as the amusing Lloyds of London insurance agent is called in to catch a thief, the real thief. TO CATCH A THIEF was filmed in the French Riviera and it is filled with lush photography by Robert Burks and there is a certain holiday atmosphere that abounds throughout the entire film. It is Alfred Hitchcock's most beloved films. Emotional fireworks abound.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Diamond dash is an easy and fun game to play on a tablet or pc although its easier to get a high score on a tablet! You can buy extra lifes if need be bu a new life is replaced every seven minutes or so and you can ask your fellow fb friends to give you lifes :)
B0014LTKY6|5.0|I do so remember my laserdisc copy of this film. TO CATCH A THIEF is a very entertaining film. Cary Grant is brilliantly charming as John Robie the infamous and former jewel thief.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The start of this book was slow, began to pick up during the middle with a grand finally at the end. Attention grabber,  Maybe, But definitely a final look at the shining. Us King fanatics will suffer through it all just to find out the ending. Nota a bad book but not GREAT either.  Hope this helps those that are curious. Good Luck.
B001PKHS68|5.0|The Centennial Collection of TO CATCH A THIEF is the definitive edition of this classic Alfred Hitchcock film. TO CATCH A THIEF is one of the most entertaining classic films from director Alfred Hitchcock. Cary Grant is brilliantly charming as John Robie the infamous and former jewel thief. Someone is copying John Robie's style as the famous cat burglar and that sets the table. Is the vacationing Grace Kelly going to be his next target? Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are beautifully paired and their moments together on the screen create fireworks of heartfelt emotion and passion. Let us not forget John Williams as the amusing Lloyds of London insurance agent is called in to catch a thief, the real thief. TO CATCH A THIEF was filmed in the French Riviera and it is filled with lush photography by Robert Burks and there is a certain holiday atmosphere that abounds throughout the entire film. It is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most beloved films. Emotional fireworks of passion do so abound in TO CATCH A THIEF.<br /><br />The extras in this edition are very worth having and are truly very good. They are excellent.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great show. Even greater episode. Not to spoil anything, but this one was on the slower side. Haven't decided if that's a bad thing yet. Just something I noticed. I'm sure they'll tie everything in next episode.
B00AAQ7JNA|2.0|In my opinion a simple concert. A little borring. Nothing like the real concert.  I would not recomend it. I have deen better.
B008OOYALE|5.0|dragon story is a wonderful game! this game has about more than five times as more dragons to breed than it's leading dragon game rivals. also the graphics are the best I have ever seen on a free game. I would defenatly suggest that you get this game. it is my absolute favorite game ever!!!!!
B00DQVSTCG|3.0|I really liked the photography of the blu ray. What i did t like was the sound. It feel like overlaped. Nothing like the real concert but its good if you want to remember.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I haven't written many reviews anywhere but wanted to start writing some and thought I would start with one of the most influential books I have ever read.<br /><br />I read this book over a decade ago and it changed my life. I have never read something so inspiring and uplifting and hope-provoking, for women in particular and the world in general. I read it again a short time later and then recently bought the hardback. I read adult fantasy and though this is not strictly my kind of high fantasy I was glad to come across it.<br /><br />Phew what a breath of fresh air. Female characters that actually reflect female people I know, female people that might have been, and a history, as sad as it is, that may have come to pass. And also religion with a goddess. Truly different, thank you.<br /><br />It continues to be an inspiration in my life and I hope that one day my books will carry the torch of higher ideals that Marion Zimmer Bradley ignited. I wish I could thank you in person. Rest in peace MZB.<br /><br />J*
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have a hard time keeping the character relationships straight.  Will reread the book in the future and hope to keep these relationships in line
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It seems to be the Stephen King of old, I liked it a lot, but I am a King fan from long ago.  I started with &#34;The Stand&#34; and will continue until he stops writing, just wish he could write more than one a year, I reread his books over and over.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The photographs woven through the book were a great addition to the story. Without them it would have been just another fantasy. The ending was a bit stale, should have continued some into the sequel.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It seems people on Facebook, myself included, rely on the canned cartoons to express their feelings.  How about getting original again, start speaking for yourself.  Do some original thinking and write your own feelings on your page.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|...this was a unique insight into the possibility of an afterlife.  I would not typically give any credence to a &#34;super-natural&#34; experience but Dr. Alexander, due to his medical expertise lends a sense of authority.  A very good, quick read.
B00AB65SVE|3.0|I loved this show during seasons 1 & 2. I think it slid a bit during 3 but it was still pretty good. Season 4 had maybe 1 or 2 good episodes but certainly not the season opener . . . I think the show is less clever and seems to be trying to appeal to different audience.<br />Gloria is becoming much more goofy and less intelligent . . . and seems to take a larger role this season. (She's not that funny.) It just doesn't totally work. The play between all these characters is what works. I think it is mistake to make Claire too nice, Gloria and Jay too stupid and the kids too much in the background. (BTW, the Dunpheys are the funny kids -- especially Luke. Manny sucks. Lily doesn't sound like a real kid . . . but she can be funny.) If the show started out this way, I wouldn't be watching it. (Season 5 sucks so far, too.)
B0089LOG02|4.0|It was a novel but a very real story.  It is so sad that children in our country were and are treated this way.  I enjoyed the book.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|This is a great, great album, one of Paul McCartney's best. Fresh, modern, superbly recorded and beautifully written. The melodies latch on to your brain cells and take up permanent and pleasant residence. It's lyrically engaging, up beat as ever and, well, NEW! Thanks Paul for all the music, all the love. Peace.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|The author weaved the stories of each character pretty well in the beginning of the book. I was interested until Cecilia read the letter. Then I thought the story was silly. I did finish the book and there were a few things I could relate to but all in all not my favorite book.
B005N09L5C|5.0|I've been meaning to see this for awhile and I wish I saw it sooner. It was a great movie, but it left some unanswered questions. I'll be picking up the book I liked it so much.
B00E9E4EC8|4.0|Alan Jackson is the all-time best and this album provides more evidence of that fact. Buy it and see for yourself!
B000RLFJQ2|3.0|Very nice movie. It drags on a little, and it loses its thrill.  Great acting and great music throughout the movie.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|App has large numbers and is easy to read with or without glasses.  Easy to program and set up, have used it a couple of times and works well.
B006BQM762|5.0|Great story line with fantastic sound quality and HD quality is perfect. Riveting and worth a big bowl of popcorn.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is a real page turner and I assumed as I started it that it would be pretty light and not terribly well written. I was wrong. This is a very well written book and the author does a great job of weaving all the main characters lives together at different points in the story. I rarely do this, but immediately after finishing this book I went online and ordered another by the same author!
B00EOO55GW|5.0|This CD is reminiscent of Ronnie James Dio and Judas Priest.  It is well-written and produced.  Even though the singer can't hit Halford-style high notes, his drummer and lead guitarist more than make up for that with their own style and character.  I highly recommend this album.
B00F35BV64|5.0|don't overthink this.  just enjoy it.  it will give you reason to go back and watch  all the other ones!!  AND I can already see the sequel(s) to this one.  how lusciously  clever !!!  i so enjoy it when we get hope for more good films like this.<br />HOW DELIGHTFUL IT IS TO NO BE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE IN A MOVIE!!!  just about anyone can watch this---very little swearing,  the good guys win and the bad guys lose,  lots of fighting but no gore.  There were a couple of sort of sexual scenes that were really stupid and didn't advance the plot, but didn't derail it either.  I suppose even enlightened movie makers really think they have to do that to sell a film.  Toooooo  stupid, but at least they kept it  to a  minimum. Not like Jerry McGuire where the sex in that  film absolutely derailed it and made it disgusting to watch.  A truly enjoyable experience this one.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|Steelheart, the first book in Brandon Sanderson's Reckoners trilogy, is a terrifically plotted but flat book. It is fast-paced and intricate in its action, but it ultimately lacks thematic focus or characterization. And I am a reader that gobbles up deep characterization.<br /><br />Steelheart takes place in a world where every superhero is actually a supervillian--imagine if every single X-Man was Magneto and you've got the gist of it. When a mysterious celestial body named Calamity appears in the sky one night, a handful of people begin to develop monstrous god-like powers. Some of the regular humans who remain are the Faithful, those who believe that eventually a good and heroic Epic will appear who will protect the weak and vulnerable unchanged humans. The hopes of the Faithful have been as yet unfulfilled: every Epic is a force of oppression and destruction. One of those Epics, an invincible man who goes by Steelheart, killed David Charleston's father. David Charleston spends the subsequent ten years gathering information on both the Epics and the sole rebellious force of Reckoners--normal humans who assassinate Epics--in a personal quest to avenge his father's death by taking out Steelheart.<br /><br />What follows is some of the best written battle scenes I've ever read. Seriously, Sanderson wrote the shit out of those. There are also a pair of forseeable but well executed plot twists which set up the next books in the series. It is a decidedly readable book, and I fully intend to read the next two installments in the series. But this is not a book which will stick with me. The book itself suffers from the same pitfalls as the Epics themselves: it is one-dimensional, it has little heart, and it drives itself forward on force and momentum alone. The protagonist, David Charleston, is the latest bland installment of the plucky, scrappy kid looking to make good. He's enthusiastic and clever and swayed by pretty faces and...that's really it. The Reckoners come across as characters even less developed than David. There's the scowling but very hot Megan who serves as David's love interest and foil. There's the soft-spoken giant Abraham who fixes things. There's Tia, the cola-drinking researcher. There's Cody, the peculiar Southern sniper*. And there's Jonathan Phaedrus, called Prof, who is the remote and enigmatic team leader.<br /><br />The problem with this--besides the fact that each of these are stock characters I've seen before and will see again with very little added--is that what should be differentiating details for this characters ring hollow. For a particularly egregious example, Cody, the Southern sniper, consistently misuses the word \\"y'all\\" throughout the text. For those of you who did not grow up in the South (and a cursory Wikipedia search shows that, indeed, Brandon Sanderson is a product of elsewhere), \\"y'all\\" is a contraction of \\"you all.\\" We use y'all to refer to groups of people, to indicate a collective or plural `you'. No one uses y'all when addressing a single individual. Except that Cody does this over and over and over again in the text. And for me, who is fluent in y'all, it was confusing as hell--I kept trying to figure out who the other person in the scene was. Take also the fact that before Calamity Phaedrus was a fifth grade science teacher who, despite his nickname (Prof), has no graduate training. Except that it is nigh impossible these days to teach without a Masters' degree. All of this is to say that Sanderson was much more concerned with the cool lasers and gadgets (and they are very cool) which moved his plot forward than spending time getting the details of his characters perfect--and when those details are less than perfect what I, as a reader, was left with were a bunch of characters so lacking in dimensionality or realness that it was difficult to get emotionally attached to them no matter how fun the ride was.<br /><br />*Note to non-Southerners: not every Southerner is a sniper, folks.s.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. I don't suppose I will really understand what the characters in the book go through but it gave me a perspective I never had.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting so freaking long for Candy Crush Saga, I am loving this game. Today is officially the greatest day EVER!!! Tons of fun, everything everyone says it is! Five big stars!!!
B00D8H3Q2G|4.0|Sounds excellent on SACD, wish they had removed the actor's voices.<br /><br />I thought they might, but alas no.<br /><br />Great soundtrack, recommended highly on SACD.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is awesome! It really does work! It freed up so much space on my tablet! Thanks a lot!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed the book overall and loved the ending!  But throughout was befuddled<br />every time I started a new chapter there was a new narrator.  Perhaps if I read more than<br />30 minutes a night at bedtime it would not have felt as disjointed to me!  I was constantly<br />waiting for the different story lines to converge!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have loved this game on my iPhone. Am so happy that there's finally the same one on my kindle!  :)
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I could not put this book down, I read the entire thing in one day! I definitely would recommend it!
B00DW1WR14|5.0|I've never written a review for a Pearl Jam album before, but I will say that I've been a fan club member since I was 17 years old. So, call me biased, but I'm honestly sick and tired of people putting down recent Pearl Jam albums because they're not Vs or Ten. Uhmmmm, it's not 1992 anymore either? Their music has constantly evolved with the times. This is certainly part of that evolution, but there's lots of rcokin' happening. It's absolutely beautiful. Can't wait to see them live next month!!
159463176X|3.0|Bought the book for bookclub, since my request was 744 at the library.  There are so many plot lines that none of them is actually followed to any satisfaction, leaving the reader to wonder how some characters arrived at the places (both geographically and emotionally) they were at the end of the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging. Love to play looking for all the hidden secrets. Another thing is remembering the sequence of shown puzzle parts.
B004LROUNG|4.0|A great read. I never noticed how many ads from injury law specialists are in existence until read this gem. It's quite humorous at times and moving at others. I'd recommend this book to anyone with a taste for justice with a hint of David v Goliath nostalgia.
B001BANK32|5.0|Having seen the movie more than once I was ready to read the book. Aside from the maze/animal difference, the book and movie were amazingly close to form.<br />good read.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Once I started I couldn't put it down.  Great app for all ages.  Love the 15*15 on my kindle fire.<br /> Definitely recommend this app.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Very thought provoking and sentimental at the same time.  It brings back memories of my youth and explains the way things were.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator app ever! So easy to use. I love the big buttons. It's also great for my kids to use. It's one of the few apps that I use everyday.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|allowing or not for a closing of the circle or a circulating through the vast new techno world, Egger brings to the fore questions beyond the control and surveillance of information, to inquiring into the new lifestyles and forms of relations that may be taking shape in a fictional company like the Circle, its Dysneyeque campus and the engulfing powers affecting its smart indefensible costumers, users and employees. a.k.a. The Coming of the Full Circle.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I've read this book twice and enjoyed it both times. The characters are well rounded and believable. The story is novel and the tale unfolds naturally through an intriguing series of events.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to set up and use, works best with Netflix. You can use your computer or smartphone to adjust volume, pause and restart a movie.
B000IZ8SD8|3.0|I don't blame others, it's just that the writing was not strong enough. The actors could do only so much for the characters assigned to them. The most important aspect of Star Trek types movies is the building up of the story, the natural progression to the scenes with smooth transitions. Although it's a sci-fi, I expected stronger, less cheesy show. The script did not seem to have been able to keep up with the changes and the resulting expectation of contenmporary audiences of Star Trek. Of course, those who subscribe to the nostalgic aspect of the TV series, will certainly find the movie OK, even great. But I could not help thinking Star Trek in this show has remained stagnant, tied up to the seventies or early eighties mind-set. Sorry, I could not be more specific, it's late in the night. You need to watch it without FAN bias. Of course, I could be off by quite a margin, being too picky occasionally about movies.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This is the third time I have tried to download this app in the past 20 minutes. I have played it on my friends iPhone and I really want it. It gets to the install part then it just starts to download again. Help please fix this so  I can play.
B00FKTDKTO|4.0|Paul McCartney doesn't need to make records but clearly wants to because he still has something to say. With \\"New\\" he also continues to make the case that his willingness to experiment with sound and song structure was behind many of the Beatles musical high points.<br /><br />McCartney continues to mature as a songwriter and has largely eschewed the most cringe-inducing aspects to his lyric writing (\\"Bip Bop\\" and \\"Getting Closer\\" are two easy examples of the laziness that marred some of his 70s-era work). \\"Alligator\\" and \\"Early Days\\" exemplify his mature perspective.<br /><br />Still in strong, if limited, voice. McCartney also knows how to frame and process his vocals to fit the needs of his songs. His choice of collaborators, especially producers, makes this collection of songs feel very current - and classic - in the same moment, \\"Road\\" fits into this category very well.<br /><br />Definitely a four-star effort. With this he joins Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Johnny Cash as musicians who manage to stay relevant and fresh well beyond their peers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for it to come to the kindle Fire hd awesome game .now waiting for pet Rescue.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I lol it because you get to play as a minion I mean comon is that awesome but if there was a boss battle where you get to play as Grub and v.s. El mocho that would be awesomer.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|There are thousands of books about the Holocaust and WWII out there, and many of them are very good, but thanks to a totally fresh perspective this one is outstanding. Who would have ever thought to tell a story from Death's point of view? Even if it had been told from the main character's perspective, it would have been very good. Engaging, historically accurate, sometimes funny and often heartbreaking, it is definitely worth your time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this.  Couldn't wait to finish it, but wanted more when it was over.  Great characters, chilling story.  Now I need to reread The Shining.
B007SVPZMW|4.0|My daughter loves playing this game by herself or with Grandma. There are 3 different styles to choose from, two with silly graphics for each x and o played, which keeps the giggles coming.
B0055D3EFU|4.0|Seriously love horror movies and this scared the crap out of me in a good way. Can't wait until I finally see chapter 2
B004G0SJU8|5.0|I love this movie, I had a few hours of alone time and thought I would rent &#34;City of Angels&#34; and watch it for the 10+ time. I love the romance and was is the mood for a good cry.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I fell in love with this game when we had our iPhones and I was so disappointed when we bought our BlackBerry that this game was not offered. I just discovered that I can now get this game for my Kindle and I am over the moon excited! I'm so happy I can play this again!!!!!!!!

B007MB5OCE|4.0|Two separate stories  one in the present and the second a review of every event that happened since 1905 and how our hero was involved.<br /><br />The present story reminds me so much of the inspector from<br />The Pink Panther

B0089LOG02|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was a bargain buy and I was not expecting to like it that much.  Would definitely recommend it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Thank goodness this book was on sale. I wish I could get the time back I wasted reading this garbage. So vile and awful....and then to throw salt in a wound....the ending, was pathetic. Like air deflating from a balloon. I will not be getting anymore of her books.<br /><br />I also think the author has some messed up thinking. And not in the interesting way...more like she secretly hates herself and women.<br /><br />And anyone who spends money and time on this book.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|In the 80 dollar range you won't beat these headphones.  Precise bass.  Nice clarity for upper mid-range and above.  I traded my Audio-tecnica ATH-M30 in for these which had fuller but muddier mid-range.  I suspect the M50s would compete with these.  But I'm not going to pay 2x more for them.  And I would have to try them first before conceding to them.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Good story.  The author told a heart-wrenching story about some important issues in our world.  Through the characters, the readers of this book become part of the story....opening up lots of understandings that I didn't realize.  I cried at the end of the book at about 2 am....I couldn't put it down.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I  enjoyed this album very much.  The songs are great and I really like the instruments.  I'll listen to it frequently.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|Minor Spoilers!<br /><br />AFFC is Martin's 4th book in his Ice and Fire series. Unlike the previous 3 books though, it is only half of one complete story. Martin split the 4th book in two due to length (the other half of the intended story is the 5th book A Dance With Dragons). Instead of just chopping the book in half though, Martin separates the stories geographically. This book primarily focuses on the action at King's Landing, The Iron Islands, Dorne as well as touching on the Eyrie, Braavos and the Riverlands. So if you are looking for any action from Jon Snow, Tyrion or Dany then your going to be disappointed. Jon appears briefly in the book, but their stories aren't furthered until the next book.<br /><br />Its hard to pin down exactly how this book continues the story that was left off with Storm of Swords. The War of the Five Kings is almost completed with Stannis the only rebel left at this point though his ability is limited due to his lack of numbers. This book is about the realm restoring itself after the war, or the lack of stability and goodwill following the war. The primary theme I would say its about is the failure of House Lannister in controlling the kingdom and finding out whats next as the real power players in the \\"game of thrones\\" begin to make their moves.<br /><br />The three primary storylines are:<br /><br />-King's Landing: With Joffrey and Tywin dead and Tyrion in exile, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister has become the self anointed defender of the realm and uses her surviving son Tommen as a puppet to allow herself to rule the kingdom. With her father and son dead and Tyrion gone, Cersei is finally the one running the kingdom as she feels is her birthright. But she isn't her father or her brother and despite her confidence in herself, her decisions begins to make more trouble in the realm. Out of jealously to the younger queen Margaery and forgetting her families role in saving King's Landing, Cersei begins to intentionally sabotage the relationship with the Tyrell's. She'll go to whatever lengths she can to hurt Highgarden's position at King's Landing, including trying to manipulate the High Septon and the Faith to her side. But despite Cersei's belief in herself, she isn't her father's true heir.<br /><br />-Dorne: We first met House Martell through Oberyn Martell aka The Red Viper, who came to King's Landing in SOS on his own personal mission to discover the truth about his sister's murder during Robert's Rebellion. With him dead now, factions in Dorne begin to lobby and attempt to manipulate Oberyn's elder brother Prince Doran to retaliate against the Lannister's, including his own daughter Princess Arianne. But Doran is not his brother and is much more calculating, it appears to everyone that he is going to bend the knee to the Lannister's but does everyone know what is really going on?<br /><br />-The Iron Islands: In the last book we found out that Lord Balon Greyjoy, self proclaimed King of the Iron Islands, was killed by falling off a bridge and his exiled brother Euron \\"Crow's Eye\\" Greyjoy showed up the next day and claimed his seat as King. The youngest Greyjoy brother, Priest Aeron \\"Damphair\\" Greyjoy, believes that his eldest surviving brother is unfit to be King and calls a Kingsmoot (a meeting where all the Iron Lords gather to decide their King) and decides to back his other elder brother Victarion for King. Victarian hates Euron because of what happened between them years ago and its the reason Euron was exiled. He doesn't have any intention of bending the knee to the brother who ruined his life. But Victarion isn't the only Greyjoy who intends to sit in the seastone chair either; Asha Greyjoy, Balon's (presumed) only surviving child believes herself to be the true heir to the Iron Islands and doesn't plan on backing down.<br /><br />Smaller storylines include: Jaime Lannister going to Rivverun and trying to tie up loose ends from the war while trying to maintain his promise to LadyStark to not bring arms against House Stark or House Tully. Brienne of Tarth searching the Riverlands for Sansa Stark. Sansa herself hiding in the Eyrie under the false name of Alayne Stone while pretending to be Littlefinger's daughter. Sam Tarly leaving the wall and being sent to Oldtown to train to become the new Maester for the Night's Watch and Arya, now in Braavos and working as a servant for the Faceless Men.<br /><br />You have 13 different POV characters in this book (including one prologue character) and unlike Martin's last 3 book's that is one of the most frustrating things about the book. In the previous books you had one character for each part of the story (i.e- Catelyn was the POV character dealing with the Stark Army, Tyrion was in King's Landing, Jon Snow at The Wall, Davos for Stannis army etc.) but now you have so many different POV's for each story that you have a bunch of characters that only have 1-2 POV chapters, some of which you question why they even have chapters in the first place.<br /><br />This problem is especially notable with the story at Dorne. You've got 3 different POV characters; Princess Arianne Martell, Captain of the Guard Areo Hotah and Ser Arys Oakheart, a member of the Kingsguard.. Oakheart and Hotah only have 1 POV each and neither feels necessary to the story. Arianne has the only chapters where anything relevant happens, why not just put the minor information from those two characters chapters into hers?<br /><br />It also happens at the Iron Islands, though its not as irritating as in the Dorne story. You've got the Kingsmoot story from three different characters; Aeron, Victarion and Asha Greyjoy. After Aeron calls the Kingsmoot he ceases to be important to the story yet he gets more POV's than the other two. Asha probably doesn't even need her one POV chapter as everything you need to know about her comes from one of Victarion's chapters. Victarion is probably the only one of the three you really need.<br /><br />Its minor criticism but it can be a bit frustrating when you have to read a 20 page chapter from one character's perspective that feels like it amounts to nothing and then not have it expanded upon again for the rest of the story. Cersei has the most POV's with ten while Jaime and Brienne have the next most with seven each. Sam also has 5 and I think Sansa and Arya have 3-4 each. Everyone else has 1-2 chapters.<br /><br />Once everything gets going though it is still an entertaining read. Jaime's story in particular as he learns to adjust to life without a hand while still remaining the head of the Kingsguard is probably the best story in the book. Brienne's is probably the most frustrating. She was one of the most intriguing characters in the last two books, here she is given what feels like a pointless story as she wanders the Riverlands in vein looking for Sansa. It makes it even worse that we, the readers, know that she is looking in vein because we are reading Sansa's POV chapters and we know she is at the Eyrie. The only time something good happens is also the end of her story in this book, making things even more frustrating<br /><br />In the end it feels like a transitional story(or at least half of one). This story had to be written to get to a more important story. I feel like this is a set up to the final stories that concludes the series. But its Martin and its still a great and entertaining story, though its not as good as the first three books and its the only book in the series to not get 5 stars from me.Stark to not bring arms against House Stark or House Tully.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|I love that you can get all the classics so accessibly and it with one click, boom it was there.
1478230096|2.0|Not only are there typos galore, there are grammatical errors as well. Most frustrating is that there is no translation of the sometimes quite long paragraphs in French or Latin. The conclusion of Les Miserables is a paragraph in French, but this book does not translate it! I think there are better books.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Characters are so vivid and the writing is beautiful! Been reading King for over 30 years and will never stop until he does!
B0026IUXME|5.0|This is truly a wonderful, realistic, and true account of one man's struggle and survival during the most horrific time in history.  My students who viewed this in my Holocaust class always have a better understanding of this period in history and have generated many questions.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Bought this album for work (mail carrier) to keep my pace up while walking. I walk about 12 miles a day for work and some days it's hard to stay motivated. This has great music that is up-beat without being pop or crappy catchy. I like it.

B007FTZDN8|5.0|This app is very educational, I have it on my cell, kindle, tablet and I watch it all the time on my laptop!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was one of those books where you just don't want it to end. But the end was so satisfying! I can really feel how King has matured in his writing over the many years that I've been reading his books. As usual, I could easily picture all of the characters as well as the action as if they were taking place in front of me. He is truly a master of writing--the way he uses words just amazes me. It's a shame that so many people only think of him as a scary/gory writer when he is so much more. Loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great app. I argue you to get this app. It works great and love this game. The only thing I hate is the lives.
0807014273|5.0|As one would expect, Dr. Frankl's book, addresses life under extreme circumstances (NAZI concentration camp, WWII era). For anyone that wants to better understand what it took for people to survive such extreme circumstances and what man is capable of in mis-treating others.
B002ZG99IG|5.0|I have spent way too much time pondering whether or not to buy this movie. I was afraid that it wasn't going to be very good, but it was awesome!
B002SQ364Q|5.0|as a retired hippie who attended the original woodstock music festival in 1969, i am always interested in anything woodstock-related.  this is a great movie (although somewhat fictionalized) which sheds light on a small family's huge impact on the event.  lot's of fun, even if you are not a woodstock veteran.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I love this movie! Chris Pine is excellent, as well as the rest of the cast. For any Star Trek fan, this would be an awesome addition to your collection.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|as an avid fan of jimi hendrix, i enjoy hearing anything and everything that he had recorded.  this cd is no exception, but as expected, it is far from his best work, and only serves the purpose of showing where some musical ideas originated.  without his supervision, all of the releases that have been produced after his death lack the detail and perfection that he strived for.
0767817664|5.0|I first watched the new Fright Night with Collin Farrell and realized that I really wanted to see the original. I watched it online just once and was hooked and finally I can own it now. It would be a great addition to any horror film collection, especially since it's almost Halloween.
B003VANOFY|3.0|The sound quality is pretty good. But the earpiece generates heat, in the summer, it is unbearable to have extra heat around my ears. The power button is not very responsive, and the charge dock stop charge after 1 year usage. I had to request RMA and Im on my 3rd one now.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is totally addictive! I haven't been able to put it down. Of all the games I have on my kindle, this is the one I use to most. I also have it on my phone and laptop. Totally love this game!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Slow to start but once you get the three main women characters about one third into the book.  Great story, liked it a lot.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great book.  I always forget how much I enjoy King 's writing until I get his latest. This was one of best in quiet some time.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The writers for Castle keep it fresh, fun, and thought provoking.  The characters are easy to identify with and the actors do a great job moving the story line along.  I've enjoyed every season!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Masterful writing, plot twists that will blow you away!  The comparisons of GRRM to Tolkein are justified. Can't wait to read through the series!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I was able to download this app and it worked extremely well, I am very pleased. I would recommend this app to anyone.
B009MYAQK4|4.0|I like the book for its universal and brave messages. However, it reminds me so much of Gibran's &#34;The Prophet&#34;, that sometimes, when reading, i was not sure whether it was Gibran or Coelho. I am not saying this close similarity is necessarily a bad thing, just that I prefer thinking about Coelho and Gibran (writers in general) individually. In this case, the two intertwine enormously. Anyway, I recommend it as a book full of wisdom to which it is always good to return. Especially if we try to follow Goethe's recommendation: Every day one should at least listen to a little song, read a good poem, look at a fine painting, and, if possible, say a few reasonable words.&#34;
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very well written book. The character development was excellent but, a little excessive in spots. The ending was disappointing but sadly realistic. I would read other books by this author just because she is a good writer. I just didn't care for the storyline or the ending.
B005LA3Z9M|3.0|A good read & I really enjoyed learning the meanings of flowers, the tending of the vineyard & the overall love & respect of nature, but I did not like or relate to Victoria at all, maybe this was the author's intension, but if a sequel was written I certainly would not be reading it.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I fell in love with Phillip Phillips when he auditioned for American Idol.  I knew he was going to be the winner and make it big.  His albums are amazing, his music makes me happy.

B00BMR4RIG|4.0|This app gives me all the info I need and does it very efficiently. A couple of swipes is all it takes to see what's in store for the day.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Can't wait to start the series now. I read this per-quill first because I hate going back once I've started but it was n awesome book and a great change up from your typical vampire/magic books that are out now
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|The reboot just keeps getting better. The enterprise is the star of the movie as allways. But the new generation crew pulls it off again. I wonder what Shatner thinks of Chris Pine's portrayal of a young inexperienced dangerously impetuous James T. Kirk. But Scotty steals this one.
0805003002|5.0|The book was in remarkably better condition than I expected based on the preview information. The price was truly a bargain.<br /><br />Anyone interested in 12th century royalty of England, Wales, etc. should read this and other books by Sharon Kay Penman.
B000059ZLH|5.0|such an awesome show and kick butt features. but, i just didnt like how they brought characters to life. in my opinion , they just should have focused on stage. but, thats just me and my only gripe.
B000286SCO|5.0|on Live In Tokyo, James' voice is in top notch and so is the band. 5 Years In A Live Time : this is NOT James' fault, but, while on vacation in Cuba and accidently ate contaminated shrimp and was violently nauseated. he threw up so much, his vocal cords were ruptured, thats why he couldnt hit the high notes until Six Degrees came out. BUT, i give him kudos for giving and gave it all he had. his voice didnt suck to me, but again, kudos for having guts. i saw them on this tour and they kicked so much butt live. Dream Theater is a BAND. its not called James LaBrie and the Dream Theater band. lol
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is highly addictive!!!!  I can't stop playing it - the kids and I sit here and laugh and yell at the game :-)  download as soon as u can - we love it LOVE it.  Can't turn the game off - great idea whoever developed it

0399162097|1.0|What a disappointing writing of a disjointed theme.  I couldn't wait to read this book and couldn't get beyond the first forty pages without wondering why I was so anxious to read this book. I just hope my Book Club does not choose to read it!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The book was a compelling story that read easily. There are many gems. One example I particularly liked was that (paraphrase) it takes both courage and humility to accept a gift.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Graphics are nice and its overall a really fun game.  It's cool buying and customising your own guns and ammo. I would recommend it.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|cant top Hangover 1, so dont set yourself up for that, could have used a little more depth or even some cameos,but still worth a few laughs!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! Only negative I can think of is the embarrassment of crying on the subway while reading it.  Probably not the most &#34;manly&#34; of moments...
B003O86FMW|5.0|I WILL recommend this book to all those ACTION seeking readers... ! The second book to this trilogy only GETS 10 TIMES BETTER!! O_O I COULD NOT put this book down and I LOVED IT... ! Definitely at the TOP of my FAVORITE BOOKS list :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is totally sick! Doods I really reccomend you to play mcpe.Its the best RPG GAME ITS SO AMAZING YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY IT
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Not real convincing.. Must everything be converted to film, I don't think so. Not worth the price of the ticket.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Almost perfect, this BBC series reminded me of a less gritty but equally powerful version of &#34;The Killing&#34; shot in Seattle.<br />The characters are compelling and we are drawn into the lives of people in a small beachside community shattered and mistrustful after a young boy is found dead on the beach and a police detective consumed by his own tragedy who is enlisted to solve the crime.<br />The acting is some if the best I've seen in years.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Just another great read. Thanks for a library of great books. As  always outstanding characters and addictive story.<br />Will continue to read.
B005HEPN06|5.0|This season of Star Trek: Next Generation contains some extremely thought-provoking plots. The writers did a great job of not only entertaining but making you think about some current topics. Yes, I know this show came out 30 years ago but many of the topics are still relevant ... in fact, even more relevant today than they were then. I enjoy the show not only for the acting value but for the mental stimulation as well. Excellent!
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|michael doughlas always played alpha males in his films who were solidly heterosexual. you pictured him shooting someone or bankrupting them, not floating over to the piano to play or floating over the stage in feathers and furs.  you also did not picture him having an affair with the also solidly heterosexual matt damon.  well, that's what these two actors did in this film and it is hard to picture anyone doing it better.  douglas becomes liberace and damon becomes his much younger lover, one is a countless series of young studs. liberace paid dearly for this of course because his promiscuity led to his contracting HIV and then AIDS.  he died of AIDS back when everyone who had it died of it.<br /><br />douglas manages to catch every nuance of liberace's character.  he could be charm itself with both his audience and a new young lover he spotted on the horizon. he could also be pathetic as when he tries to hold onto any semblance of his youth via wigs, costumes, makeup and plastic surgery. he can also be a monster which occurs whenever he turns on someone who thwarts him in any way.  when he is ready to jettison a lover, he is cruelty itself. he even captures what works on stage and that is that he presented himself well to his largely female audience, charmed them, entertained them with his piano playing and costumes, just as if her were visiting in their living rooms back home.  i doubt anyone who was in this solidly middle class, middle aged female audience could have handled learning he was gay. they all believed in his \\"saga\\" which was he missed out on marrying the love of his life, sonja henje, the ice skater actress, and never was able to fall in love with anyone else.  his fans knew this as if it were a biblical quotation.<br /><br />all in all a terrific film.  with it, its director, steven soderbergh, left film for television where he has pretty much a carte blance on developing similar vehicles for HBO and other cable channels. although it showed as tv in the USA, it was shown as a film internationally, including at film festivals.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Spicy, unexpected, fun, suspenseful, in short, a great read. Definitely reconnected with my inner goddess... Couldn't put the book down until it was done
B008JFUNNM|5.0|CAPTAIN PHILIPS is absolutely captivating and edge of your seat entertainment. I did not even realize they were making a film out of this incident. I saw the trailer on television a few weeks ago and it looked very interesting and very intense. It was very intense. I want to go out and see it again. If this is all true, What went on behind the scenes is incredible and rather frightening. We never know what we will do in times of crisis. I highly recommend this film.<br /><br />I love maritime films and almost any film dealing with the seas, it challenges, its dangers, its lure and romance. CAPTAIN PHILIPS is an adventure dealing in the era of new challenges and dangers in a modern age, in a world slowly turning upside down. Well done Captain Philips.
B000VI12ZS|3.0|Nicolas Cage was not at his best. His acting was visible. Storyy was a little formulaic. Other actors were good.

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Had fun and really Enjoyed it!! Would play again soon!!!! Or if there was a sequel  I like finding games!!
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|This is quite simply a stunning watch. It doesn't tell a story in the conventional sense, but it does have a narrative that runs unspoken through the film. In essence it is a collection of clips filmed across the world, it is edited to form a sequence covering aspects of life from a myriad of cultures. There's no speech it's all silent with a superb soundtrack, again reflecting the multicultural vision of the film.<br /><br />The visuals are amazing, it has to be watched in high definition. The glimpses of lives all over the world make this a fascinating watch. Some of it is uplifting, at other times cruel and disturbing, but it is always interesting.<br /><br />The soundtrack is also worth mentioning containing a variety of songs that match the visuals perfectly. This is an awe inspiring film, the two hours just passed by without notice.<br /><br />You may have guessed that I really enjoyed watching this and I won't apologise if I sound like I'm gushing and I can't recommend this enough.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This book really opens your eyes to people.  I have always been a fairly good judge of character.  But after reading this, I can pretty much read people's minds just by watching their actions and reactions.  If you are in any kind of management position, it will really help you to interact with different personalities and KNOW how to work that person.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Fantastic! Unbelievable the sound and calibre of this band is still up there with the best .  They sound better than ever. I love listening to Peart's drumming as I'm definitely a drum chick !!! Married to a drummer makes me a little biased :)

B004N6369Y|5.0|Very interesting book.  I could not put it down.  Great family story and one of her best books.  The book has a very happy ending
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE A GREAT STORY, GREAT ACTORS, AND IAN RICHARDSON IN THE STAR ROLE? WE HAD WATCHED THIS FIRST ON TELEVISION, AND DECIDED TO PURCHASE IT.  NO REGRETS.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Fun times with this music. You can never BEAT Elvis whan it comes to entertainment. He was a pure classic. What a voice
1442362537|3.0|I found the book to start slow. That said, the dead air between each and every tract in the audio book is both frustrating and distracting. It seemed in some cases the tract was so short the dead air between the tracts was longer than the tract you just listened to.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is very well written, the characters are engaging and the story is fascinating. I would definitely recommend it.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book has one of the best twists I have seen, is well written and the characters are well developed.  I highly recommend.
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|Still a great movie.I have seen this movie many times but I really enjoyed it on my big screen TV in Blu Ray. It's one of those classic movies that inspired copycats, and variations, and still does to this day.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|I love how Disney's princesses are now gaining some power of their own. Brave is a great story of Merida, a Scottish princess, who tries to take her destiny into her own hands. A great family story with the magic of Disney!
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|With plans to travel in Europe next year, I was hoping to learn at least some conversational German, but I can't manage to even sign in on my Kindle Fire.  I receive an error message that my email and password is not correct, even though I've entered it correctly several times.  I've even uninstalled and re-installed the app in hopes of accessing it.  Any suggestions?
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The story draws you in making you addicted to what come next.  I highly recommend this book to anyone. Especially Robert Jordan fans.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Super fun app. I wish they made more like this. It's awesome and entertaining I will dedicated be buying the next one.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I have read all of Moriarty's books and have really enjoyed them all. This book is a bit different in that it has many different characters and several story lines within the main story. The book is well written with most of the characters being well developed. The book had several sad/discouraging themes to it which I wasn't expecting from reading a description of the book, but once I got past the book I wanted to see how the story would wrap up and have closure at the end. While it wasn't my favorite book from this author, it was worth both my time and money to read.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another amazingly and beautifully told story by Khaled Hosseini. His ability to describe moments, convey emotions and portray people is incredible. His stories always draw you in and keep you engaged. Great book!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I am very happy with this free alarm clock app. It has made my Kindle Fire an even better tool to help in my busy life!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman sees the world a little differently than the rest of us do, and it's interesting to see the world through his eyes.  This isn't a profound book or an artfully crafted work of literature, but it is very interesting and refreshingly different.  A bit sad and moody, but a damn good story well-told.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|What a wonderful version of Jane Eyre!  The character of Rochester has the expected brooding aspect of a man haunted by a mad wife but also had moments of actual humor and times of real tenderness.  Jane's character was also faithfully played but again moments of sweet and almost carefree happiness. I liked this version better than the Orson Wells one.
0307271609|4.0|Empress Dowager Cixi is an elegantly written book about a facinating period of transition for the empire of China. The working rules of the ruling class was religious and saturated in what we call \\"eastern philosophy.\\" Because \\"western philosophy\\" was so counter to the center of life in China, it took geopolitical earthquakes to move the empire toward the \\"modern\\" world.<br /><br />This is a dense book with fascintating detail and wonderful photos. Do as I did, read it thoughtfully and spend time thinking about this wonderful country. You may find yourself thinking, \\"Wow, so that's why China did that.\\" The book is a window into the end of an empire and the beginning of a modern country.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Only a few curse words and no love scenes...great mind bending movie for the person who likes a good suspenseful but clean movie
B008Q0D32S|3.0|I thought this was a so so movie. It was okay to watch but short of other western movies. I think there are many better movies like Tombstone or Open Range.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read a book that could make me cry, and never have I read one that was so good it made me cry like a baby curled up under my covers. That's exactly how I found myself after reading The Fault In Our Stars. I started this book in hopes that it would hold me over for a weekend while I wait for another book (Alligient!) to come out. Only I end up reading this book in two night, could have been sooner had I not been working. Even after the fact I can't think about this book without tearing up. It was an incredible read.
0307346617|4.0|This is a page turner.  Well written putting you in the middle of the horror and hopelessness.  The Battle of Yonkers was very descriptive by showing how fast things can go from bad to worst.  Book cover almost every scenario world wide. well done.
1844137872|5.0|I am a born & bred New Yorker and I am also an artist. Banksy is no vandal, he is a true artistic genius. I used to write graffiti when I was younger and those that write just \\"tags\\" are vandals. Banksy does beautiful work, transforms environments, and is very clever. He is now one of my favorite artists.<br /><br />To Mayor Bloomberg: You're an idiot...you want the NYPD to catch Banksy because you said he is a vandal? Get your priorities straight Bloomy....we have reckless motorcycle gangs terrorizing motorists, etc. Banksy is no threat.<br /><br />To my Ghetto neighbors...i.e. Bed-Sty, East NY, etc...some of you are on YouTube being shown harrassing people for taking pictures of Banksy's works on \\"your\\" walls and intimidating them for money....first off they are not \\"your\\" walls, secondly go get a job if you need money that bad instead of hanging on the street corner all day.<br /><br />Lastly, to my fellow artists bad mouthing Banksy as a cheat off Le Rat whatever his name is in France....everyone pioneers something and then there are the people that \\"carry the torch\\"....Banksy is that guy.<br /><br />Buy this book. It's awesome.
B009NH6AOQ|4.0|Started out hot but became luke-warm.  The taking of the prison was fantastic with good action but by the end it was ho-hum and struggling to keep my attention.  The Gov. and the folks of Woodberry were ran off by Flash Bangs and two people in riot gear!?!  No.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a great and easy read for anyone ages 16 and up. I couldn't put my Kindle down. The bonus was, I grew up in small town Pennsylvania, so there were some things only a PA kid could truly understand.
B000GWE44U|5.0|while not true to the book, and limited by the technology of its time, kubrik's version of king's story is both tense and enjoyable with effective portrayals by nicholson and duvall.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|While in black and white, and made nearly 50 years before I was born, Alfred Hitchcock's &#34;Psycho&#34; will always be the ultimate thriller. The screenplay and concepts were far ahead of its time. As any great film, it leaves you wanting more. (But not anemic remakes made decades later.)
B004XVMCN0|3.0|3 1/2 Stars = Very Good<br /><br />\\"Mimic\\" was director's, Guillermo del Toro , first stray into mainstream horror, though it proves not to be as good as some of his earlier Spanish film's, & later big budget & Spanish film's, this is still a highly entertaining romp, which would be many horror genre directors A game.<br /><br />It can bug you!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|This is a must-have for every classic Halloween horror film collection and thanks to Amazon's awesome price, I finally was able to add it to mine.
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|I liked the series but see how it really needed to end. One of the things I liked was the hidden agendas of Rossum Corp, Adelle, and each of the regular characters and especially the final strategy for using the 'dolls' that became the final straw for some of them.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This film is for all of the little girls who didn't sit around waiting for prince charming to rescue her... this one is for the little girl who grew up to rescue herself from the clutches of the Wicked Queen. Kristen Stewart is amazing as the bad*** Snow White in this spectacular departure from any version that's been done before. Expect battles, not ballgowns.
B0026977EK|4.0|Very entertaining movie. The dynamics are great between the stars. I particularly liked Rebecca Hall. Woody Allen really is at his best when he is showing us people at their most vunerable.
B0049MAXQG|5.0|This was the first horror film I ever saw as a kid, and a Catholic kid at that, and it remains my favorite horror film to this day. Scores of films have added &#34;exorcism&#34; to their title or dabbled in the theme, but none ever comes as close to scaring you in all the right ways as &#34;The Exorcist.&#34; A must view every Halloween.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Alma is a unique heroine in this novel that never let's the  ugly duckling become a swan, but what a delight she is to bring a tale with passion , science, history,psychology,philosophy and true pleasure to this reader!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I didn't want to read this book because I was told some untrue things about it but now I'm glad I did. The beginning is a little off beat which makes it hard to get into but after the first few chapters and the annoyance of Anna's roommate it gets much better. I would and already have suggested this book to someone.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Fun game keeps you working at guessing and drawing. Just wish you can free draw in this game. A very good game.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It passes my time when I get really bored but fun none the less they could add more types of emoji but I think it's good
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Took me a minute to get in to it. But once I did it was really good! I'm happy there are a lot of seasons!
B004LP3AYI|4.0|I snapped up this second in the series because i am dying to find out what comes next for Kahlan and Richard. I think the editing in this book puts a dampener on the reading. There are a few spelling mistakes and many many left out words such as a, the, and etc to make the reader stop and pause.<br />There needs to be breaks in the book to show that it has changed point of view. I am having difficulty at times following who the subject is. There needs to be a better flow.<br />In saying that, the tension and emotion in this book are just as good as Wizard's first rule. And the some of the scenes are so well written i am cringing and thanking God we live in a world where that kind of evil does not exist (at least it doesn't where i live!).<br />I will be buying the next one :)
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I enjoyed this series with all its brooding, irascible characters and peeks into the pettiness of small town life.  Certainly, the subject was dark, and some characters, until later in the series, were almost cartoonishly locked into their rigidly defined characters, but the scripting, acting, filming and eventual character expansion kept me interested and caring about the people and the situation.  I am looking forward to seeing how the series continues.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Film arrived in the exact condition as advertised and came much earlier than the projected date.  Don't generally like Woody Allen films but this one is a beautiful rhapsody to Paris.  If you love the city as much as I you'll love the film.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun it reminds me of temple run, it's cute I just wish things were explained better and u didn't have to download huge files to play different areas .it also seems hard to collect coins to advance
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Product was in exact condition as advertised and arrived much earlier than the projected date.  Would recommend the film to anyone who loves the seasoned actors (esp. Maggie Smith) in it.  Was also surprised to see retired singers, conductors, etc. used in the film.
1577312082|4.0|I enjoyed this cd.  It was very enlightening and makes you think of focusing on the present not the past or future.  Instead enjoy the moment, slow down and appreciate the now experience.  Well done!  I also love how quickly I received it from Amazon.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Alter Bridge's Fortress: 10/10<br />Wow.......wow, this album is perfection. Alter Bridge has re-affirmed themselves as the Kings of Rock with this album. I in all honestly could write an entire essay on this album but i'll just say this: I have been a firm \\"One Day Remains\\" is still the best album but this might just have taken that crown. Highlights: Cry of Achilles, Lover, Waters Rising, Farther Than the Sun, All Ends Well (one day remains feel to it, loved the s*** out of it.) and the final track Fortress, which, that solo....damn. Also, Mark Tremonti once again proves why he is arguably one of the best guitarists in the world, and alongside him, Myles Kennedy once again proving why he one of the if not the best singers in rock today, and of all time.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Twists and turns keep one saying to themselves, &#34;Just one more page before I set the book down and get &#34;whatever&#34; done.  Great book, anxious for the next one to come out!!
B00EO4SBSG|4.0|This is a very good album from Trivium. I liked In Waves, but i thought overall it wasn't their strongest effort, falling behind Shogun and Ascendancy. I think Vengeance Falls in better than In Waves personally. The first 3 songs are an awesome trio opening, which lead in to some familiar Trivium songs in No Way to Heal and To Believe, At the End of This War and Through Blood and DIrt and Bone. Villainy Thrives has a unique tone to it, but Inceneration and Wake are two standouts by far. The intro for Wake is going to send chills up your spine, and leaves the album on the perfect end note. Honestly, if you love Trivium, you'll love this album. Less screaming than the Shogun era still, but has the all familiar double bass-kicking, melodic in your face metal that we all have come to know and love. Keep it up Guys! (P.S. Heafy, please grow your hair back out sir.)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addicting!!!  Great for those &#34;down&#34; times between appointments.  Definitely link to Facebook so you can get help from friends...love it!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I played this game before as a guest and Really loved it. I am so happy to.be downloading.it to.my.own device.
B00B89LZ4C|1.0|Like others, the packaging has been opened and taped back shut; ruining its collectable value. Also, it did not come with the bag of blue crystal meth as advertised.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|&#34;Illumination Theory&#34; is one of the best musical moments in Dream Theater history! Bold statement but true. Go buy this album and support DT everybody!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Khaled Hosseini did it again ! This book is as great as The Kite runner or a Thousand splendid suns.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Alicia, the good wife, is the center plot and her adventures mostly evolve out of her lawyer practice.<br />There is enough action and turns to keep one interested in this series for a long time. If you are<br />watching it on Amazon, do start with series one and work your way through the developments.<br />Can't help it, her husband is a sleazy politician. Not for kids or teens.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy they finally have the real version! I tried some of the rip off versions, and they were terrible. I'm deleting them now that I have this one. The only thing I would change is more lives. I hate having to wait around for more lives. The game is great, and I am amazed that I could have so much fun with swiping candy around! Great game, I recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants a great app!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|continuing twists and turns. Not liking the love triangles especially when both men can be sleazy, she should do better<br />for heself.  Still...not for kids or teens.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is super. I simply click on and I can get the days weather or the weeks forecast.  It's really great.
B006TKP2B2|3.0|Really wanted to enjoy this book more.  Great writing style and premise, but the plot was a bit weak and anti-climatic.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As is typical of John Grisham, he captures your interest at the very beginning and holds it to the end.  Once you start reading The Racketeer, it's hard to put the novel down.  The fact that Grisham writes in ordinary everyday vocabulary makes it easy to follow his plot.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|Used to be a fan of Silicon Valley startup Sound Hound, but ended up switching to Shazam because it simple recognizes more songs!  Wish Shazam had a web or Mac version, but using this app version works fine.  Great at recognizing a large varitety of pre-recorded music.  Simply amazing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just like subway surfers because my m8 got me into it and because its a good game if your bord and also cause its a challenging game
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|Took a couple of days to get through all the levels.  Impressed at how many levels there were.  Unlocking the badges takes time (like getting crowns on each one by completing each level with a minimum number of balls).  Didn't think another Angry birds like game would catch my fancy, but this one had the right sense of humor and game play to keep it interesting!  When I finished all the levels I kept wishing for more, maybe a future version can do an in-app purchase?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I totally love this game and u will too! Me and my brother both love it. I play it all the time! All u gotta do is build and fight monsters in survival and in crearive u gotta spawn your own stuff and build and u get GET unlimited blocks! (Only in creative) kids love it grown ups even love it! It may be a little pricey but it is worth it!!!!!!
B000002LMM|5.0|Great music, different but very relaxing. It makes a very nostalgic mood, and I recommend everybody who need some peace in heart.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This app is so fun and the best part is is that it's free. Just beware there are things to purchase in the game. Other then that is super fun.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It's a pretty good game so far three boost could be better but good so far I like the game and
B007EC27QM|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP IT EASY TO USE AND FOR ME EASY TO SEE NOT LIKE SOME CALCULATORS WHERE THE NUMBERS ARE SMALL GREAT FOR ADDING UP YOUR MONTHLY BILLS HOPE YOU WILL HAVE MORE APPS FOR PEOPLE WHOSE EYE SIGHT IS NOT GOOD
B0092C2X7U|1.0|I have tried over and over but it wont let me get the game and it is very very very stupid
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This game was really good and since it's free it's suppose to be ad's but there is only a little  and it's really fun for you
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book from start to finish. Hated for it to end, it's filled with every emotion you can imagine.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Nice graphics. Would prefer puzzles that can be done entirely by logic. Could not finish some larger puzzles that had few squares shaded.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Very entertaining ! Interesting show type of space cowboy. Joss Whedon needs to bring this show back or revive with a new series. If you like this show you should watch Serenity to give you some kind of closure of the show since it was cancelled after the first season.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|There is so much wisdom and warmth contained in this book that all I can say is &#34;WOW.&#34;<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Read this. It is one of the best investments of your time you will ever make.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I cannot believe some people would give this app 1 star. It is incredibly flexible and fairly to set up.  It works very well. I am thrilled. o
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|The Circle is a heartbreaking work of staggering genius, and unlike his earlier memoir of the descriptive title, this is a memoir for our society.  The Circle is a fascinating thought piece about what is happening through Google's mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible.<br /><br />Eggers describes a world with no secrets, and his characters make a good case for total transparency.  The Circle, however, also raises interesting issues about what could happen if it is really possible to know everything that is knowable.  Are we ready to trade off privacy for safety?  I bet most Americans would say yes.  The question The Circle raises is the long term consequences of the trade; and unfortunately, The Circle does not really suggest a solution to the agglomeration of data from grocery clubs, credit card records, phone and toll records, and the increasing use of video surveillance.<br /><br />We live in a society which has valued independence and the ability to reinvent oneself.  The Circle points out that in our new era of big data we have lost the ability to withdraw and change and are prisoners of our past and the unelected holders of our information hold the keys to our prisons.<br /><br />Although the book is really a thought piece, it is well written and fun to read.  It does not answer any questions, but it puts Orwell's warnings in a modern context and will make people think about where we are, and where we want to go, if indeed we have a choice.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|Saw this when I was a preteen in the 80's, but have a new appreciation for it as an adult.  Beautiful photography, interesting history, and a message worth repeating.
0812550706|5.0|First in Ender's Saga, a science fiction series revolving around a little boy who saved the world.<br /><br />Visit [...] for a chronological listing of the books in the Enderverse.<br /><br />My Take<br />Graff, Anderson, and Rackham's chats behind the scenes clue you in as to what they're doing to Ender. It makes it both better and worse as we understand the why and want to scream in horror at the destruction of this lovely, little boy. Maybe this should be in the Science Fiction/Horror section…<br /><br />Scott Card is really good at dragging you in. It wasn't until I started this review that I even wondered why it had to be a child.<br /><br />The Battle School students are pretty amazing, but when you add in Valentine and Peter with their essays on the 'Net...the concept of their intellect will blow you away.<br /><br />Ender's power is one of excellence. It's Peter who wants to rule the world, and Valentine who wants to save Ender.<br /><br />After all that these kids have been through, the war is over and Alais wonders what they'll be made to do next. It's Petra's \\"We're kids. They'll probably make us go to school\\" that cracks me up...god knows there isn't a lot that's funny in this.<br /><br />Instead it's horrifying, mindbending, and totally absorbing. If you enjoy military science fiction, tension, and drama, this is the book for you.<br /><br />The Story<br />Earth is desperate for a Fleet Commander. Already they have fought off two invasions from the buggers and Earth is taking no chances. All efforts are focused on finding someone to lead a battle fleet and destroy the buggers. But time is getting too short and Ender is their only choice. There is no time to find and train another.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ender's parents have moved the family to North Carolina where Mother and Father hope that nature will have a calming influence on Peter and his...urges. But Valentine knows it's only helping him to hide them, and she is still in danger. Although, with more maturity, perhaps Peter is getting a handle on it. As part of his bid to take over Earth.<br /><br />But the stress is getting to Ender. Nightmares of previous games, encounters with Peter, all play with his head. The only sympathy is from the other kids and even that is minimal for Ender is their leader. Not their schoolmate. Not their friend.<br /><br />He just has to remember that the enemy's gate is down. And break the rules.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin is six years old when IF takes him to Battle School. He'll miss his sister, Valentine, but not his psychopathic brother, Peter.<br /><br />Stilson is the first bully Ender confronts and is his ticket in. Bernard is another bully when Shen is Ender's first experiment followed by Alai.<br /><br />Ender meets Petra in Salamander Army who teaches him enough to get up to speed. He faces up to Commander Bonzo Madris, another bully but with power, about free play. Then it's Rose de Nose (??) and his Rat Army and Dink Meeks' toon.<br /><br />The teachers just keep cheating, and now Ender has his own Army at age 10. No trades and only Launchies and failures including Bean, Crazy Tom, Han Tzu, and Fly Molo.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I didn't realize I was waiting for this book, until I started reading it. Excellent and classic Stephen King.  I read it in 4 days and I was sorry when it ended.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Good information to have. I will definitely keep this for my next &#34;love&#34; relationship. This might have saved my marriage.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I thought it was a little young adulty but still liked it. Gaiman has a way of transporting you. However mundane the story or scene is. It was a great book to curl up to. Memorable with lots of wonderful little insights and observations. I still fondly remember scenes from the book even now.<br /><br />Good read!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy that candy crush became available on amazon apps... I waited for a long time because I couldn't get it any other way on my tablet. And suffice to say, very addictive and fun! Moved along in levels much faster with app. So download and have at it !!  :)

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This product is nice to use but you will get frustration when you will find out that smartphone especially iPhone do not support this device even in the chrome browser. You can stream YouTube from iPhone but not other media from Chrome Browser.<br />But you don't have this problem in laptop though.<br />So wondering are they fixing this issue soon?
B006G3JPWO|5.0|My favorite Halloween movie. Just a great family movie. Bette Midler is hilarious in this. It is fun all around.

B005HEPN06|5.0|I'm somewhat new to the genre and series but I love it. The characters are great as well as all of the classic sci-fi story lines. My favorites are the existential ones.

B004LWZW2E|3.0|Insidious 2 much better. Better script, bigger budget, it's almost as though they just redid the first film with much better quality. My advise just go straight to Insidious 2.
B008Y7HABI|5.0|good series, descent drama, good actors and ok roll i will recommend it to other people you will like it as well as i did and thats it. later.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am only about 35% into this novel but I can say that he is back to his original writing style.  He lost me for awhile with some  of his novels.  But this one is definitely one of his best to date.  Highly recommend this one to any King fan.  It is a must read.
B003U53GK8|4.0|good series, descent drama, good actors and ok roll i will recommend it to other people you will like it as well as i did and thats it. later.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally King added this game to amazon apps!! So happy!! Graphics are great and connects to Facebook easily. Fun game to play everyone should install it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome I like how they make it holiday themes. I hope they make the game all holidays.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|I thought the story line was excellent and I liked the casting of the characters. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in war stories.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|It was full of surprises and very capturing... it also had amazing features like pretty theme s and.more it was useful and elpful
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|ENgrossing and addictive story and characters. Can't wait for next season. This is a classic series that I hope does not end soon.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I have a kindle fire and I.have well over 1 Gb but when game tries to.install it says I don't have enough space. plz fix.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Handy calculator and works the way it should. I plan on keeping it for a while. I like the history feature.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|During times of stress &amp; a lot of demands on my time-Candy Crush Saga is the perfect distraction &amp; stress release! Thank you for finally making it available for Kindle Fire!!!<br />When I need a little break from reality, this game is a great solution! And it has had a great side effect of diminishing my sweet tooth!! -Now if you can solve my potato chip issue, you will be the #1 diet aid!!!
B008JFUO72|5.0|Oh, Robert you make my heart throb.  I am divorced and if you ever get divorced, let's hook up! But back to the movie, excellent movie that I watch over and over.
B007EC27QM|1.0|What good is a calculator that does not follow something as basic as the order of operations? What good is a calculator that you cannot trust to give you the right answer? And what good is a calculator that requires internet access just to work? And WHY does it need access? DRM, maybe? I guess you have a right to watch out for calculator thieves, while I have the right to not support you or your applications, developer. Also, I love the \\"testimonials\\" screenshot. KOMO 4 Seattle? Really? Impressive! LOL. That makes sense I suppose, since pot is legal in Washington state now. ;)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it is a fun game for not only me but all three of my children. Even the challenge is better than I thought it would be.
B00EK3EFEA|5.0|Quite possibly!  I saw Diane twice live when Bible Belt came out and was very impressed.  Nothing But A Miracle was sublime.  Then, she vanished.  Now 4 years later we have a very mature Diane who is very different and yet the same.  This release hasn't lost any of her magic while expanding it with great depth and beats!  Echoes of Kate Bush, Annie Haslam, Stevie Nicks, Paula Cole and so many others.  No, this isn't Diane imitating them or performing a tribute to them.  This is an amazing tapestry and distillation of them and so much more yet this is DIANE!  Buy this CD at any cost.  It will make many best of year end lists and, if there is any justice, you will hear many of these songs on the radio for a long time to come.  The DELUXE version is the way to go as no song is weak and this is the best example of a DELUXE version being truly DELUXE!
B008Y212PI|4.0|A simple concept for a game, but still engaging and fun. Like the graphics and themes. Good way to waste a little time and relax.
B007EC27QM|3.0|The stock Android calculator on my Galaxy has about twice the features that this one has. Calculator Plus is missing parentheses, which is a big deal to me, and a multitude of scientific features that the stock calculator has. CP seems to boast its percentage button, but the stock one has that button as well, and it works better. The design is a little dated, though I think iPhone users would probably dig it. All around not a bad piece of software, but it just can't compare to what Android already has built in.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Easy to use with seamless looping. Very useful for meditation or for help falling asleep. I only wish it came with more binaural beats to choose from!
B000YCLRBA|5.0|Hvorostovsky (Onegin) and Gergiev (conductor) join with Fleming (Tatiana) and Vargas (Lenski) to present Tchaikovsky's Russian opera based on Alexander Pushkin's immortal love story.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Liked Drew point of view in the book that was different. Then ending was great and I really would recommend this book to others.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time Candy crush saga is on the kindle. The only thing is that if you have extra lives on your smart phone, your lives will not be available. But I so love it. I can play it on my phone or my Kindle Fire
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never lost interest.  I was drawn in from the beginning all the way through the arena to the end.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Surprisingly these have really good sound for the price.  If you're looking for a cheapo pair of headphones you'd be hard pressed to do better.
039916409X|5.0|This book has helped me a great deal as it has touched on matters that I didn't realise existed within me. It is an uplifting tool and I recommend trying it for yourself. Thank you M. Lynch and others that are sharing this self knowledge with so many of us.
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|I'm a little bummed the Black Crowes got back together.... I really want to see this band live instead.  Huge dead influence on this, which is probably the reason I really like it.
B0045EPCQ4|2.0|Committed was well worth the small price I paid. In a couple of places, Liz get.a little long winded in her marriage history lessons. I enjoyed listening to it and did so twice before putting it away.
B00CZ1HELA|5.0|I would highly recommend this game.  Very fun and challenging trying to connect the pipes.  I would recommend it for any age group.
B00BB8V2V6|4.0|Cute movie great writing acting is superb with all well known stars in their youth.  You can see Portmans talent already. Great movie.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|Just Elton and his piano, with a little help from others.  If you're a piano lover or Elton lover, you are going to love this CD!
B004J4XGN6|5.0|I am not an entrepreneur, but I still found this book very useful. Anyone building a new product either on their own, or within an organization must read this book. Infact, all managers in the IT industry should read this.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Really charming gameplay and graphics.  In each level, there are multiple objectives of increasing complexity.  Be sure to locate your friend, the cute ferret on each level.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Well written characters that you will come to love...and hate! Interesting story lines and great acting make this series one you will one to continue watching.
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|Like the case , it's different . Everyone that I know talks about it . I would recommend this case if you have a HTC
B0057A6GA6|5.0|this tower defense game has awesome graphics great sound and very challenging. If you love tower defense games, this game is a must!!!
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Love, love, loved this book!  The chemistry between Pia and Dragos is so hot you will need to have the air conditioning running when you read this! Seriously! The tension between those two is intense.  I read this book because it was recommended on the thread about jealous/possessive heroes on Amazon's discussion forum and wow! They were right. Dragos is a total alpha to the max.<br /><br />With 266 reviews, and counting, I won't go into a story overview except to say, it was really good. I haven't read a lot of books with \\"magic\\" in them, so I wasn't sure what to expect in that regard. Well, I was blown away - seriously. The story was so engrossing that even if the dynamite chemistry between Dragos and Pia wasn't there, I still would've liked it.<br /><br />If you are looking for a hot romance with a super possessive, alpha male and a likeable heroine, you have to read this. Trust me.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Would be nice if the timer function has the option of not having the gradual increasing volume.  Great for waking up! One two three for five
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for kindle to get this game FOREVER. Finally I have it and I've been playing since I got it last night. I'm already addicted!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun game! I would recommend for relaxation and family fun! Me and my two sisters enjoy the competition! We live in different parts of the country...keeps us connected.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Although it took Mr. Martin a very long time to bring us this story, it was worth the wait.  Excellent.
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|I love Nirvana and since Kurt's death in 94 I have not seen anything so powerful and moving. Live and Loud is a great purchase, and one I will watch time and time again. Dam I miss Cobain.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I see why all my Facebook friends have been sending me Candy Crush Saga requests. Not only did they want me to see this game fun and addictive, but they also needed extra lives from me! =)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the real candy crush now I can play with my friends thanks amazon because you  care about your costumers keep working just great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun game for the family. Addictiveto play. Great graphics. Realistic movements, sound and appearance.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who loves horses.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Insightful and thought-provoking book that looks into how strategic thinking can overcome many perceived disadvantages.  Great series of examples to support the models.  The simple charts are helpful.  Get pre-college kids to read the chapter on Choosing a college.  Insightful to see how kids in college all behave according to their peers and a bell curve.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Got this for my son, he loves it and calls it a &#34;great toy&#34;.  It's hard to put down and - no batteries required.  The toy is well made and was shipped as promised.  H
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy seek and find games. While this one is fun, it gets costly. I downloaded it for free. Due to my own character flaws, namely...impatience, its becoming costly. You can only play for a short amount of time (about 10-15 min if your lucky) because you need more energy to play. You can wait until tomorrow and its free, or you can purchase crystals. For four months I refused to buy crystals, but now, I just want to see what happens....Ive already spent an ungodly amount of money buying crystals that dont last long. I could have bought a new outfit...shoes and all. Its fun, but I say if you are impatient, dont do it to yourself and start this game. If you have some will power, you will enjoy it. Its the same screens over and over, but they get harder each time. So it becomes more challenging.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Let's be honest, we all love a good hero show.  In this case, it is a ragtag group of them with no super powers.  Think a bit of Avengers (not superhero group) + knight rider (for cool gadgets) and A-Team for the Fun.  Shake well and add one agent Coulson.on top.  The only thing I am hoping for is the occasional cameo from various Marvel heroes..
B00992CF6W|4.0|I'd like Minecraft more on XBox360. The mods are cool but I don'n get them.Back to the XBox. The XBox has more features like mine carts and and 100000 more things. PEACE! Have fun playing
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|We have watched this and compared it to Rio Lobo so many times that we pretty much know the dialog. We are Duke fans to the max.
B009X2CVXA|4.0|This book took a bit to get going but once I got to half way I was really enjoying the plot. It was worth the time.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|The characters are wonderfully deep in this story and much to share with the audience. Love prevails between them and is found on a wonderful spiritual level as well. Many are martyred for their cause.
B002NN5F7A|2.0|Yes, the scene with Alec Baldwin is a classic (&#34;Coffee is for closers!&#34;) but the rest of this movie was a letdown. My feeling is that all those who insist you watch this movie (it is a cult favorite in the sales world, every sales trainer in the world will suggest you watch it) stopped paying attention after the Alec Baldwin scene. The rest of the movie is a gigantic yawn. Understand that this was an adaptation from a play - as a result, the dialog is very unnatural and dated. The plot also is very dated, it revolves around &#34;leads&#34; (basically people who saw an ad and sent in a postcard) that the company generates or buys, and these &#34;leads&#34; take on enormous (and completely unrealistic) significance in the story. Great actors give excellent performances in the film, but the plot drags so much that the performances are lost in the drabness.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|This is with out doubt a fun movie. If your family loves Science Fiction the way mine does, this could be one of thoughts you never get tired of watching over and over. It starts out spoofing SyFy and draws you into it with humor and unexpected twists. I will not spoil it for you by giving away the high points or the tear jerkers embedded in this masterpiece of entertainment. Suffice to say this is a MUST SEE SyFy  original.
B00BMEF97W|5.0|Bring Me The Horizon has definitely redeemed themselves with this new album. The lyrics are absolutely flawless. Oliver's screaming has changed, but it's not a bad change. After their long hiatus, this album is brilliant.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Was hoping it'd be good.  Entertaining throughout, though slow in certain areas.  The response to the wicked witches was absolutely EPIC!!!  Elevated the entire movie from good to great!
B00FEN000S|5.0|Robots vs monsters? Can't get any better, this movie killed it and jax from sons of anarchy makes it amazing
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|The movie was great!  A very different and entertaining take on a classic. Jack in a very likable character that you root for.  What makes this story good?  Different, unpredictable, likeable characters, edge of your seat scenes.  Will see it again!
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|A great book.loved. it could not put it down. KEEPS YOU GUESSING WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT. Read it you will not be disappointed.
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|Story of a guy who lives on one side of the tracks (planet) and a girl whom he likes that lives on the other. Its against the law for either to cross over to the other world.  He hatches a plan to win her heart but what good could possibly come from the relationship and how could they ever hope to be together legally?  The risks and the end game are too great for him to undertake.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I can't wait for the 2 hours and 30 minutes to pass to get my 5 new lives to play again. You can also buy lives, but you have to do housework sometimes. This game is very addictive. I just simply love it.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one is a sleeper.  Way too much dialogue, wayyyy to much foundation laying.  Massive dearth of action in this one!  If you want to watch characters talk then this is the movie for you.
B00B999E12|5.0|Great soundtrack by an amazing group of people. Everything on this disc flows evenly with the film. Buy it! NOW!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved it,sorry I waited so long to read it, the ending was ...Human. I may read the rest now. We will see.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|It's a fun game, defiantly worth a buck. Many ways to get free punchos (currency). Vsauce 3 sent me here.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was wrapped up by the author's writing style. Her descriptions are vivid.  Highly recommendable to experienced readers any gender.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|wish this game was out some time ago, shame now they just made available for the kindle fire. now that I have tried the game can now see why so addicting.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|Dis shat is gud. The chuggs gave me da runs but I don't stop listnin. Can't stop tha mwtaaaaaaaal. W w
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|Best video app I downloaded this year simple easy fun I really love this app a lot I recommending to all my friends
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I resisted getting into this show, but it's so good! The only issue is I've been staying up late to watch extra episodes:-)
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This is one of my favorite Diana Wynne Jones books.  If you've never read anything by her, and you've ever enjoyed ANY fantasy movie or book, you're missing out big time.  Her stuff is classic—most of it predates Harry Potter by more than ten years.  And it's better, by far.  (This is from someone who stood in line at midnight to purchase the 5th, 6th and 7th Harry Potter books on the nights of their releases.)  Her books are nearly all &#34;children's&#34; books, and ALL of them are intelligent and well worth reading for adults.  They are &#34;tightly packed&#34;—to quote a blog post by Neil Gaiman:<br /><br />&#34;One of the privileges of having kids is that you get to read out loud to them, and reading Diana out loud is a delight. Her books unpack very tightly, with scarcely a word wasted in a hundred thousand, and reading them silently it's easy to miss stuff without knowing it.&#34;  —Neil Gaiman<br /><br />Another thing that sets her books apart from the vast majority of fantasy authors out there: nearly all her books are set in different worlds.  Most of her books are standalone.  She does have a couple series set all in the same universe, but even then they NEVER have the same main characters book after book.  That comment that applies to some authors: &#34;read one of her books and you've read them all&#34; emphatically does NOT apply to DWJ.<br /><br />This particular book is an excellent one to start with.  Really, I have about 25 of her books and they're ALL excellent, but this is one of the ones I recommend people start with.  Some others are &#34;The Dark Lord of Derkholm&#34;, &#34;The Lives of Christopher Chant&#34;, and &#34;Dogsbody.&#34;  But really &#34;Howl's Moving Castle&#34; is the one I usually recommend first.  Enjoy.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I choose this novel based on such positive reviews. Although intriguing initially, the plot was fairly predictable and the ending actually a damp squid. Disappointing. Actually, there is no end and the reader is left frustrated. I began to get increasingly irritated with the characters portrayed. If you are expecting a great conclusion to this thriller then you will be disappointed.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie will keep you in entertained from the beginning till the end. It's got plenty of action, a little bit of humor & drama. It allows you to get to know the characters who make the movie what it is!!!! Definitely worth watching.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  I'm on level 125 on my phone.... to bad it doesn't transfer over. OH WELL, just means I get to have FUN ALL OVER AGAIN......
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|As a Star Trek fan you can't go wrong owning a piece of the franchise that you can watch over and over.
B007EC27QM|1.0|Take it out,from your phone or tablet.Useless crapp,inferior to the default android app,don't waste 10mb to install it.It's one of those products/services on Amazon making you wonder why they don't have a negative rate system.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My kids absolutely love this movie. They watch it everyday and it has been a great way to keep them busy.
0375842209|1.0|The writing is merely high school level. 550 pages of platitude. None of the events in the story is really touching. Actually, they are common, formulaic and predictable. The book thief did not really make a career out of stealing books. The title is an exaggeration. Zusak likes to use one-liner, but none of these lines have any dramatic power. The summary before each chapter is annoying. Perhaps Zusak knows his writing can easily put the readers to sleep?<br /><br />Each characters in the book is either good or bad, totally depending on wheather he is against or for the Nazi. It's doubtful that Liesel practices writing using paint on the wall, given that paper and pencil are cheaper than paint in any age. Besides, wouldn't the basement be full of the paint smell? The book written by the Jewish refugee (Max) is nothing extraordinary. If Zusak meant to write something that can rival Le Petit Prince, he failed miserably. There was not much dialog between Max and the family. His relation with Liesel is hard to believe. Actually, Max is almost a faceless shadow, although Zusak did devote some pages to his youth.<br /><br />Basically, this is an artless book. I suspect Zusak is either talentless, or just wanted to cater to Hollywood. The market is already inundated with Holocaust stories. If Zusak is indeed a great artist, he should use his talent on more original materials.
B00DB97LU4|5.0|Product is exactly what I was looking for. Price for product is unbeatable especially since it is not sold locally where I'm from.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|3/4 thru book, holds your attention. One Stephen Kings better books.  It answered questions about The Shining. I hope the ending is a good one.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I did not know this actually took place. Very interesting, even tho fiction it was based on true events. Sad for children to be used in servitude instead of being loved
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Excellent series!!! Very interesting ideas of science, wonder where this technology gonna take us one day. Sky is the limit.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Tricky enough to keep your interest and simple enough to not be frustrating.  Maybe next version could include a timer and solving quickly gives bonus points.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|Third time is obviously not always a charm.<br /><br />The much-anticipated BRIDGET JONES: MAD ABOUT THE BOY isn't anything like the prior two, which were absolutely shocking, brilliantly hilarious, and fun.  The third book in the series is just shocking.  Bridget and Mark are no longer together, Bridget is a widow because Mark is dead--which left me thinking: I can't believe he's dead? For approximately 300 pages of Mad About The Boy.  However, now that Bridget is a 51-year-old woman (yes, Fielding fast-forwarded that far ahead in the future), she hasn't grown or worked out the kinks in her life one bit.  Bridget is, once again, a singleton who will never grow up? Not even a little?<br /><br />That said, this installment is a very fun, yet sad read.  The spirit of the book is still there, however, something is missing without Mark Darcy.  Other than some ridiculously odd printing issues and grammatical mistakes--this was a very good read.<br /><br />Beware, if you loved Mark Darcy and Bridget Jones' prior relationship--you may dislike this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It's very addicting. I wondered why we couldn't get it on Kindle when everyone else had it. Thank you Amazon for finally giving this game to us. Yay!  The only thing I don't like about the Kindle one is that it doesn't just bring up your Candy Crush playing friends to ask for more lives.  It gives ALL of your friends to ask, and I can't always remember which ones play and which ones don't.  Other than that, this is absolutely great!
B00BAXFAJC|2.0|I expected brilliant from the award winning book. It was only average in my opinion. All about crafting a plot. No depth in the characters.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As the author stated in an article that I read somewhere, he often wondered what happened to little Danny Torrence.  So had I.  When I first heard that he was writing the book, I'll have to say that I was a little skeptical, but I was very interested.  (That, in addition to the fact that I consider Stephen King to be a genius and I'm a long-time fan.)  As some other readers have commented, no, it was not quite as intense as &#34;The Shining.&#34;  But I don't know that he claimed it would be.  In fact, he stated in his afterword that he is not the same man today as the man who wrote &#34;The Shining.&#34;  I'll have to agree with that.  As much of a fan as I am, I will have to say that I favor his earlier works.  I read &#34;The Stand&#34; at least once a year, for example, as I consider it one of the most incredible books ever written, by him or any other author.  &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; has its own intensity and its own scary moments.  It's also very touching, insightful, I enjoyed it very much, and I recommend it to all Stephen King fans.  He is still The Master.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I like the philosophy but not being a medical professional, the terms were a little too technical.  Kinda took me away from the flow of the story.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this is a awesome game.Me and my sister love this game!I love dressing them up and taking pictures of our girls! and it works perfectily
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Star Trek Enterprise, is a very good action packed DVD Series. It startes the Vulcan and &#34;never give up&#34; themes (even though it is the last of the Star Trek Series).<br />I wouldrecommendt this to anyone.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Don't get me wrong, that's a good thing. I absol-utely love Dragon Story. There were plenty of errors that would occur and they were very incessant, annoying, and repetitive. And I have a Kindle Fire, and we still haven't gotten the Arctic Isles, TeamLava! But let's get to the positive  aspects of the game. The game is fun, though rather simple, so that beginners don't get confused and ditch the game due to bad controls (believe me, there are some out there). The dragons are unique and, of course, very colorful. The gifting mechanic is good, and better than some other games TL has released, despite a limit on how many gifts you can send. The breeding...I live for that mechanic. Now I only play games like this, like DragonVale and My Singing Monsters. It changed the way I play on my Kindle every day. THAT'S a good game.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed this book and read it in one afternoon. Being from the Midwest, I was already familiar with the orphan trains. I've actually cared for a patient who was adopted off an orphan train.<br />I liked the flashback story much more than the modern day tale. I did find it a bit unlikely that Niamh would give her baby up for adoption given her yearning for her biological family and her own adoption experience.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Classic King - you've got to love his imagination! I loved the way the book completed a circle from The Shining and closed the circle at the end.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I am now on the fourth book in the Outlander series and have thoroughly enjoyed each of them.  They remind me of the character development and historical reference of Ken Follet's writing.  I would highly recommend them, but do start at the beginning of the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|They finally got it the app i love it. VERY ADDICTIVE. It took them long enough to get this app -____-
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Great! I can use it without a lot of going here and there. I love my choice. The ease of use was beyond words
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|for those of us that didn't want to mod our kindles to play the game wooot its about time<br />thank you amazon. I love this game
1401323820|5.0|Just as advertised in the show. Great suspense and just intriguing reading. Wanted to stop after 10. -20 pages but couldn't put it down.
B008JFUR10|2.0|I have watched this movie a couple times and I can say that it seemed slightly better the second time I watched it. I suppose that if it hadn't been done in such a way that resembled the Transformers in a big way I would have found less fault with it. The other thing I disliked was the predictability of the entire screenplay, I guess another way of putting it is that it had a strong scent of \\"cheese\\" to the entire production. If you want to see Robots get a Transformers Blu-Ray and pop some corn,
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book plays on your emotions by bringing fiction to real life loss that only ms Collins can do for us. She has eloquently provided an excellent narration that all are sure to enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The only game I play anymore. It quickly becomes addicting . It easy to play and at the same time can be super challenging.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|I like protecting my Kindle Fire, but feel that this case could be better designed,  I would have like to have seen the ablity for it to be propped up. I would recommenedit as protectlion.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the Shining and re-read it before reading this one.  Well worth it.  Stephen King is my favorite author.  His books are more insightful and scarier than ever.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|This book was one of the best books I've ever read, the storyline is amazing, action packed, and you get to truly love and hate characters<br />The book always left me on my toes, even when I couldn't read it anymore. Definitely buy this book. You won't be disappointed
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this game is soo fun and soo cute.ths game is adorable and very cahllnging! most apps arent like this but this app is out pf this world! get this app!
B00004W510|5.0|Again, as with my review of the Big Pink album, why all the extra songs? What was on the original LP was just fine, and I believe it sold like hotcakes, right? As it was? Why can't the makers of these reissues just reissue the original LP without adding a lot of filler. BTW, since I listen on my iPod, I just don't listen to the filler.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett does a fabulous job intertwining fictional characters and actual HISTORY!!  Once you start you won't be able to put it down!!
B00004W50T|5.0|I remember when this album came out. Everyone was so excited, but I never owned the LP. Now I finally have a digital version, which is great. I listen on my iPod. I wish when they reissued old LPs that they would not stick in a bunch of extra songs. The original was just fine and I liked it. I would not have felt cheated by having it, so I don't need a lot of extra outtakes. Like many corporations, whichever one it is that put out this recording was afraid to let the listener think for him/herself. And could stand the idea of &#34;wasted&#34; band width. Really!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this as a Youtube Streamer. I own a Roku as well, That is an awesome Streamer. But accessing Youtube is a painful process. This little thing just works and as long as your in the Chrome browser, you can do just about anything. Last.fm on your Surround sound! Pandora, Google play Music! it just does it. I really like being able to queue up video's on my phone then it just plays them.<br /><br />The only problem I've run I've run into is that the app doesn't really get along with my Older Android phones. It will work fine with Youtube for a bit then crash the phone. And I haven't been able to get the Google play Music app to actually Cast.. No biggie, It's new and they seem to be kicking out updates so the app might work better in time.<br /><br />If your looking for a cheap Youtube Streamer, I would definitely recommend this. I think this little guy may have just relegated my Roku to a Movie rental Box. And it may eventually completely replace it.
B00FPH6M82|2.0|Will Smith sleepwalking through his role, son Jaden not understanding the character, they all thought that throwing CG at the audience was enough. It's not. What a yawn, I'm sorry to say.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very very very very fun! It is so fun and very challenging. I like how the game look like candyland.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Not sure if I really liked it ,,but it was entertaining,and we all like Brad Pitt,so it was worth the rent.<br />Did keep you wondering who was going to make it until a solution to the problem was found.
B00DAABKQK|5.0|I must confess that I enjoy keeping up with flash backs and flash forwards. Perhaps I am too comfortable with this style of storytelling, but the story is rich in imagination and profound in its understanding of human nature.
B003MX8RJS|5.0|At the surface, it's a fun movie about Aaron Eckhart playing a silver-tongued PR rep.  If you want to look deeper, the movie makes a point about living in a manner that is congruent with who you say you are.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great great for the most important thing to change the best possible price for the post<br /> popular has a standard for the most important thing to change the
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great book the exercises are simple and effective. What a brilliant idea to create baby steps that proves the existence of the law of attraction. Thank you for writing this.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|THIS BOOK IS INTELLIGENTLY AND VERY WELL EXECUTED, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING EBAN IS  A  NEUROSURGEON AND NOT A WRITER.  LANGUAGE IS IMPORTANT AND HE RENDERS A SITUATION THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE.  WE ALL WONDER ABOUT THE EVENTUALITY OF DEATH AND THIS BOOK WAS COMFORTING TO ME (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE &#34;WORM'S EYE VIEW&#34;).  NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT PART OF THE JOURNEY.  PERSONALLY, I DON'T FEAR DEATH NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE PROCESS.  NOTHING CAN HELP US WITH THAT PART OF THE VENTURE.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I would have rated a five but some of the items are so tiny, they are almost impossible to see.
B00E6F1522|5.0|The sounds quality on this Bluray disk is amazing. I only wish a few more of my favorite Ferry/Roxy Music songs had been in this concert.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Loved the book. Kept my interest from chapter 1 until the very end. Hard to put the book down. Looking forward to reading the sequels
B009PMEEY2|3.0|I have to admit that I finished this game for the sake of finishing it ratrher than it was fun or enthralling. I wasn't going to let it beat me, but I wasn't really invested either
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I recently could not use this app. without the internet.  I have several places I play this where I haven't any internet.  I will have to delete it.
B005JR47R6|5.0|Recommended to everyone that needs to be educated about sarcasm and inner issues. House was deep, sometimes sad and funny at the same time. Best show ever.
B00CEK9OTM|1.0|Might be an age thing, but I get dizzy when I play this. I tried several times then gave up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to finally have this for my kindle . Love this game glad to have it on the go.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Hadn't engaged much on Vampire Weekend until I saw them recently at ACL.  Of course, played a lot off the new record, which I now can't stop listening to.  Haven't been this dedicated to an album since LCD Soundsystem This is Happening.  Not that there is tremendous similarity between the two.  Except a NYC-centric perspective.  And I'm okay with that.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, I've waited for this game on Amazon for so long. Every time I saw my family and friends playing on their phones and tablets, I felt left out. I also checked frequently. Then last night my cousin told me it was available for Kindle Fire, I downloaded it immediately.<br /><br />Until now I settled for using my laptop to go on Facebook and play. Addictive! Can't really say anything else except I love love love this game.
B00BDSRISA|3.0|I've seen a lot of people say that this album is tighter than Lisztomania, but that really doesn't overcome just how infectiously catchy the tracks on Lisztomania were.  Honestly, I just don't find myself enjoying as many off Bankrupt.

B003SI9WYG|5.0|The movie Nightmare Before Christmas is different, but great! The music is just AWESOME. The entire family really enjoyed it.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|Worse than the original.<br /><br />While the original movie was not fantastic, this was just terrible.  Poor acting, poor action, and even worse dialogue.
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|Loved it.  I've watched it over and over.  I am an MMA fan and it was full of great action.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Chosen for bookclub selection. Enjoyed the book very much. It was fast paced and kept my interest throughout.  I highly recommend it.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|It started out a little bit repetitive.  But then it gripped me and didn't let go. A great read.  Enjoy!
0062086529|5.0|I purchased this book for a project my son had to do for school. I must say that it really got his imagination going and he talks about this book all the time and has even used purple crayon to draw his own illustrations.
B00821OX98|2.0|Very slow moving. Why there is no end even after 3 season? acting is good but not that much action.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I'm a trekie, so just about anything doing with star trek I will enjoy.  Now I'll have to see the latest one, &#34;Into the darkness&#34;.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time this app was available on my Kindle Fire. I, think I checked almost everyday to see if it was available. Finally, to my surprise it was .<br /> Hard to put down once I start playing.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My teacher started reading this book in class. I really liked it. Is there going to be anymore books to go with it.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Love the album! Great songs, perfect for any ages. Item arrived swiftly. I was surprised with the actual format of the cd, it literally is a yearbook! It's clear how much 1D truly loves and appreciates their fans. Can't wait for Midnight Memories!!!
1250038820|5.0|The most relatable book related to a specific region I have ever read. Probably because there are so many people I can identify with. Some of these stories are pure magic, and the pictures complete them.
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|I could taste the food and the dust in the stale air. This story started out complex and finished strong and simple. Much the reverse of the great Kahn's explanation of the universe. I enjoyed the story through Linbaba's eyes. And most of the characters. I found Madame Zhou irritatingly foul and Kate a bore, other than those two, I liked the rest, even the bad guys. The author is a courageous person, humble in thought and honorable in deed.<br /><br />John R.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Love it! Love it!<br />I just started watching this show over the summer to catch up with the current season.  Awesome!
B009C7JS14|5.0|I love it so much becase it tills me what to wear of its cold out side and if it warm I can wear something warm
B00F9040HU|1.0|I can't say 'cause it doesn't work. It won't go pass the first screen, instead of play, the buy button is the only option, not in downgraded mode. Lol.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|They game is is fun and u get characters from each state.... I love this game me and my cousin literally fight for the high score ..... great game.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I was able to beat this lively and fun little game, so when Azkend 2 came up as a faotd, I immediately, &#34;purchased&#34;. They are great games, similar to word games, but with a lot more action. Fun way to pass time.
B008EL25LE|5.0|This game will keep you engaged. It was fun to play and the levels are interesting. The graphics are nice. Can't wait to stat playing again.
B008EL25LE|5.0|I'm enjoying this game. Although I'd never dreamt that I wouldn't beat it, I now must face that very possibility. Still I'm enjoying it, a tad bit expensive, but the graphics and adventure games make it worth it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you are a horse lover then I recommend this game it is like you have a horse of your own

B001BANK32|5.0|So great!  A bit different from the movie but better.  I've read it several times and love the movie but recently read it again to prepare for the sequel, Dr. Sleep (which is also amazing).  True Stephen King at his best!!!!!!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Ive seen this happen to soo many people!! You'll see the meanest toughest guys at hardcore/deathcore shows throw down and mosh their anger out and then catch them with their random Tegan and Sara album in their car cd collections. But we cant help but freaking go crazy over it. I don't understand it, never will, no regrets. Its just that good!!
B008BGNMZU|1.0|I have all of the Fourplay ablums and this one is the worst, IMO. It's dull, unimaginative, and will not be added to my collection. I like Chuck Loeb, their new guitar player, but together they all sound like old men who've lost the edge. That makes me sad but such is life.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game just wish I could play more levels... but all in all I give it a 100... thanks
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I like Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford); he is epic. jennifer Lopez seem to be more younger in this movie. Is it an old movie?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got Minecraft  Xbox360 edition you should change minecraft pocket edition just like Minecraft Xbox360 edition because it so cool, awesome, amazing,<br /> and excellent.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The King is back on his throne. After a few years of so-so books King is returned home for the last 3 or 4 years. I am loving it.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The best TV show I've seen in years!  Outstanding plot and interwoven stories. Although the story moves slowly, the pace is appropriate to give the viewer time to process the story lines. Highly recommended.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Don't know whether it was just good timing for me or what but this book hit a real nerve for me as I had been exercising and have not been able to shift one kg of weight!<br />3 weeks and almost 4kgs gone and I feel soooo much better with no bread, pasta, cereals, biscuits and cakes! Still exercising but feel soooo much better and not hungry all the time!<br />Love the thinking and the rationale behind this book!
B000QE1U9K|1.0|I'm not sure who was responsible, but the story made little to no sense, and the pacing was jerky and off-putting, resulting in a tiresome mess that even the excellent cast of veteran actors couldn't save.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|It works pretty well, but freezes up every now and then. But overall pretty fun. I wish it didn't cost $20 fit the whole game though.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|This two CD album is a refresh of Bob Dylan's former album with the addition of other songs.  The music is good to listen too.  Bob Dylan is not only a good composer but a wonderful American poet.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Lots of action. A little short on plot. The background at the beginning was distorted audio and difficult to understand. The special effects were sensational.
B0095G5AFU|1.0|Does not compare to ever note. Wasted 2$ if your wanting pretty book covers then go ahead but if your looking for function over form get ever note for free.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|I first got the free app \\"Weather\\" and it kept asking me to upgrade, so I did. Not much improvement--the other two weather apps that I downloaded free, AccuWeather and Weather Bug, have more detailed information. I should have paid my coins on one of those instead. Like I said it looks nice, and the coins weren't that much (299 or $2.99)--I would purchase one of the others next time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found the beginning drawn out. However as I kept reading about Nick and Amy and their marriage  I became more interested because of the astonishing plot twist. The imagination that was use in planning all these twist was extraordinary.
1250027624|5.0|Great book for fans of D A ; I would heartily recommend. The photos and text are a great insight to that segment of British society that is so intriguing watch.
B000QCSA54|5.0|Seth Godin has such an amazing ability to nail the truth. I am an entrepreneur and successful multiple business owner. If you pay attention to what he says in this wonderful little book and put it into practice, his wisdom will be worth a hundred times the purchase price. Highly recommended.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is one of the best - and unpredictable - movies in a long time with a touch of futuristic realism! Does not lose your attention for even a minute.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This apps is one of the most addicting ones on the market.  You will be stuck fror ever trying to figure out the secret that the house holds.  Dont get me rong, you will be extremly mad when you cant solve the puzzles, but that is part of the fun.  You just have to put it down, and come back after a while.  Defenatly worth the cost of only $0.99.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is my first time to read a Liane Moriarty book. Her characters were well developed and the story was spell binding until the incident with Polly.  The ending was a bit of a let down as it was not realistic enough. I will however recommend it to friends.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Couldn't put it down....and I haven't even read The Shinning!!!! Wonderful story. The only thing missing was a little more history on The True Knot's origins.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I always said I'm not watching it I don't care for musicals, well I watched one episode and I'm addicted.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|I just could not get into this movie. I guess the characters were just not that compelling and the plot was predictable.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Thank goodness I didn't waste money seeing it in a theater.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Fun...gets you hooked creating spaces, breeding and growing a variety of often adorable dragons.  Links u with other players and gives goals to get extra points moving you forward.  Tricky if u r avoiding cash outlays, limits the best progress and access to most unique dragons and park design elements.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|good game skips sometimes and freezes but fun<br />and interesting when you buy new players it skips a lot I think its fun
B0072HDP9M|5.0|One of the books you don't get to find any more. It's not about ambition. It's not about war. It's smart. It brings you back to the true relationship with God. It's about love. Highly recommended to everyone, especially to those who are tired of their crazy-fast routines  I can't thank the author enough for this book.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. Excellent story line, interesting and believable characters, well written and kept me reading long after I should have put it down and gone to bed.  Wasn't sure if I would like it...I didn't like it..I LOVED it!! Awesome read.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|very good product I think it was a very good choice. Do not hesitate to buy another similar product. A very exciting pelícua an incredible story.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|After the last update, will not work for pdf books. When I try to open one, the app just closes. I've tried reinstalling. But it just won't work.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great way to pass time..I have been playing none stop. Only wish there was an easier way to get acorns. I will spend actual money on them.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I enjoyed watching the movie \\"After Earth.\\"  It was a different \\"style\\" of Will Smith movie..., which is a good thing.  Will Smith was excellent in the role.  He played a loving father who knew in order to save his son and his own life he had to let go of the emotional \\"father role\\" and become his son's commander and teacher.  The special effects where top notch and both Will Smith and his son did excellent acting in the movie.  I do hope there is a sequel where Will Smith is more involved in some of the action scenes.  Unfortunately, many moviegoers rated this movie low on the ratings scale.  Anyone who did not like this movie needs to ask him or herself why?  Was it too educational for you?  It seems to bother moviegoers (even African Americans) whenever black actors drop the \\"colored-folk\\" stereotypes and step into a different genre of acting. I say, why should Will Smith mold himself into a stereotypical actor...speaking the same old dialogue and phonical diction that most movie goers hear from black actors.  \\"Oh, no, yawl, not gonna...\\" etc, etc.  Movie audiences love films like \\"This is the End\\" where producers show a bunch of bodies spewing blood all over the place and clog every scene of the film with curse words.  If people were truly honest with themselves they would ask, Why are there so many gory, horror movies?  Why do our society gravitate toward films filled with sadomasochistic sex against men, women and children?  I know it is a reflection of what is happening in our society.  Maybe, just maybe \\"After Earth\\" is not just a movie to entertain us, but to educate us how the earth may one day become...if we do not change.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Watching the Previews, you could be lead to believe that WIll and his son would do battle together on the Planet, fighting the Evil People Eaters. Yet Will sits in a spaceship, and the boy does all the work. It was a well filmed show, and the Graphics, sound and color were tremendous. Cinematically it was very good, the Story Line was good, but I just thought and would've liked it so much better, Had will be with his son to train as they ventured to the wrecked spacecraft,
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I'm glad I read it before I saw the reviews. This is a story of an inner journey, gaining strength and healing while physically gaining strength on the beautiful trail. Some reviewers expected a travelogue - could they have gotten a clue from the title? Most others reacted with disgust, anger, even name-calling & getting preachy. I felt sorry for her first husband. He deserved far better, & I hope he is happy now. But really! Some even disagreed with her forgiving herself. You can't heal without doing that. You can't go back & fix the past. One has to say \\"OK, that was part of my life. Accept it, learn what you can from it, leave it and move on to better things\\". Maybe most people haven't had crushing experiences in their early lives, but still I was surprised at the percentage of reviewers who absolutely didn't get it. No wonder our country is so deeply divided if we can't understand each other any better that - and don't want to.<br />This is a well written account of a journey that I can identify with in many respects. Bad as it is for the psyche out there in train-wreck-land, you learn things you wouldn't otherwise know...things that make you appreciate real love and commitment. I hope she found that.
B002EXAB5K|5.0|It's another remake on the Famous King Kong of the 30's A whole lot better than the Claymation one from back then. Still though I'd really like to see Kong make it back to the Island and live out his life. I liked it, and YES I did cry at the END, Damed ole airplanes anyway.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally for my Kindle HD...... love it!!!!<br />Free is always good.<br />Five stars all the way.<br />Glad it links to fb
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I love action movies that take my mind off everyday aggrevations and problems. The Avengers was great entertainment and I will probably watch it again.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have always loved Stephen King. Mostly because when he was starting out, so many critics complained he was just a schlockmeister. But even in his earliest works he was digging into deep themes and exploring complex characters. If I had one complaint, it was he seemed to be pushing the horror genre barriers in some ways, while constraining them in others. As years went on those lines shifted and there was absolute brilliant work (&#34;It&#34;) that seemed to give a nod to the old molds, and broke through to something rich. King has maintained that level of work and pushed barriers to lesser or greater success since, but it has always been entertaining.<br />  This book continues that legacy. I found it less a horror novel than a supernatural thriller, that broke all of the rules of both those genres. King took everything any creative writing teacher or fiction editor would preach and threw it out the window. I found my allegiances to the characters strained, and moments when I knew what was coming, based on King's past modus operandi, never materializing, but surprisingly satisfying, even if on further reflection I found myself saying, &#34;Hey...wait a minute... your not suppose to do that.&#34;<br />Of course it helps that this is a &#34;sequel&#34; to The Shining, and that it is built on that foundation. But King shows what a true master he is by culling all of the major themes and motifs from that novel and explores the legacy of Jack Torrance from a more mature perspective. You will never look at The Shining, nor understand it,  in the same way after reading this book.<br />If you demand deep sustenance from your horror, and like to zig, when  you should have zagged, then this book will not disappoint.

B00BXI0IHS|5.0|With the birth of her heroine Alma Whittaker in January 1800, Elizabeth Gilbert has created a heroine who is every bit as brilliant, inventive and original as the century she springs from. Alma's English father had been an ill-educated and impoverished plant-thief but his wild ambition and botanical knowledge eventually leads him to immense wealth importing medicinal plants to Philadelphia. Here, he builds a vast estate with Alma's mother, a strict and highly intelligent Dutch woman who believes passionately in a fine education for her daughter. Alma inherits her parents' innate botanical understanding; she becomes fascinated by mosses in particular and studies them throughout her life. They lead her to fundamental conclusions about the nature of evolution.<br /><br />These are really just the bare bones of a story that sweeps the reader up in a compelling and richly textured narrative of characters, distant lands, philosophies and passions. When people talk of epic tales, they usually mean stories that span several generations. What is so delightful about this book is that although the story is wide in scope - indeed, it encompasses a whole world of ideas - it is always seen through the intimate and singular prism of Alma. Big-boned, tall, plain, fiercely intelligent Alma is an indomitable character and one who is destined to stay in the reader's mind long after the final page is turned. A stunning achievement by the author who more than merits this five-star rating and whose novel will have readers scurrying off to uncover more about the true lives and times that inspired it.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|King, does not write a sequel to his works.  He writes follow-ups.  This story follows characters we knew from The Shining and ones that are new.  We see the changes in character and progression of time.  It is a good story that treads new ground and introduces us to a new and interesting type of vampire.  I don't think it will knock The Shining or The Stand off my favorite (non-Dark Tower) King list, but it will be on that list.  Check it out!

1594746036|5.0|I was so anxious to read this book. I bought it thinking I would read it on a trip I was taking in 2 weeks, but I started to read it one night and before I knew it, I was half way through it! Using a Kindle or Nook would have been helpful with a few of the words. I can't wait for the next book!<br />Teachers of 5th and 6th grades should consider it for reading to the class. Using different voices and intonations for each character would really enhance it.

B00CL151G4|3.0|I've read some of the heated discussions here, with the usual how-dare-they-tamper-with-the-format complaints. It isn't *my* Holmes and Watson, etc. Well, I say there's nothing wrong with customizing. You can take a Rolls-Royce and put monster-truck wheels on it, cut away its back end and replace it with a fibreglass extension of your own design, even replace the engine with a V-8 Ford. But if you go that far, you do need to take the the next step, which is to remove the RR logo from the radiator grille. Because it's become a different vehicle now - yours, not theirs.<br /><br />And there lies the problem. The Conan Doyle characters and stories can be messed with up to a point, and you can still call it Sherlock Holmes, but beyond that point it becomes nothing more than name-exploitation. The BBC Sherlock, as scripted by Steven Moffat, remains within legitimate boundaries, because his modern adaptation leaves certain crucial things intact. First, Holmes isn't about character development. He isn't going on a \\"journey\\". His exceptional gifts come with a price-tag, which is that he is outside normal human society, remote and untouchable, and will never have the kind of human relationships the rest of us enjoy. That's his burden, if you will. In that respect, he resembles another TV character Moffat currently writes for: Doctor Who. In truth, he's an alien, a being from another planet. You cannot change that without effectively ditching Conan Doyle's creation. But that's what Elementary has done, turning Holmes into a kind of touchy-feely character that bears no relation to the original. And I suppose that's why they chose Jonny Lee Miller, because he plays that kind of role reasonably well. It has to be said that the near-aristocratic disdain the Conan Doyle Holmes has for common concerns and common thinking is something it takes an actor of real class to convey. Benedict Cumberbatch has it in spades. Jonny Lee Miller doesn't even come close.<br /><br />Second, Watsonis the chronicler of Holmes's cases, and his constant companion. He isn't a nursemaid. You can turn him into a woman without necessarily damaging the relationship, but what you cannot do is have Watson say, like Lucy Liu's Dr Watson, \\"I'm here to make the transition from your rehab to the routine of your everyday life as smooth as possible.\\" Lines like that just make you groan with despair. Also, it would be naive to think that Watson's gender-switch is not an attempt to inject sexual chemistry into the relationship, which is a radical change. It matters not that their relationship remains unconsummated; the implication that it could be is still there, and we are invited to see it.<br /><br />Then there's the setting. Does it matter that you lift Holmes out of London and dump him down in New York? By itself, it isn't necessarily fatal. But it's still a major change, as it would be for any fictional creation where the milieu counts for a lot, as it would be if you took Maigret out of Paris, or Inspector Ghote out of Calcutta. And you have to count it as one more thing to add to all the others - Watson has changed sex, Moriarty has changed sex, Irene Adler has become Moriarty - that by accumulation have turned a Rolls-Royce into some kind of bad-ass drag-racer.<br /><br />The changes that Elementary have made is a recipe for a show that could work, and could even be good, but it isn't Sherlock Holmes. It's some other show. It's common knowledge that CBS made a pitch to the BBC for the rights to do an American adaptation of Sherlock, and got turned down. At that point they decided to do their own show, but they didn't do the right thing and create new characters for it. The BBC Sherlock has become a cult success in 180 countries, and the decision of the suits at CBS to hang onto the names \\"Holmes\\" and \\"Watson\\" for their show can only be construed as an attempt to hitch a ride on it. This, of course, is helped along by the starvation diet that Sherlock has forced on itsfans by serving up only three 90-minute episodes per season. Hungry for more, the fans will start snacking on Elementary as something to fill the space until the next meal arrives.<br /><br />From what I've seen so far, Elementary isn't a bad show in itself, and Lucy Liu especially is something of a star turn, at least for me. But once you strip away the remnants of the Holmes-Watson legacy, what you're left with is hardly different from the standard police procedurals of modern US television. I'd probably be kinder to it if it wasn't masquerading as a different show and trying to run in Sherlock's slipstream.
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|Alma was well fleshed out as character, but the other characters did not resonate for me.  They seemed so odd.

B00985E3UG|5.0|Michael Moss' research is the diet pill for the tens of thousands of commercials that entice people to eat and drink not just to excess, but the wrong food and drink. The facts of obesity are by now well known. Mr. Moss raises the unanswerable question: why, in the fact of all the facts does the problem continue to get worse and worse in North America and Europe? Asia is beginning to see its obesity problems expand. The solutions may be as simple as reading the labels on the food we buy and rejecting the packaged foods that have been fattened, salted, and sugared beyond excess. The power of the food lobbies is revealed, the politics of food parallels the engorged consumption of food in this comprehensive piece of reporting. SALT, SUGAR, FAT, is the first step in a three step program to better eating and drinking. The facts are overwhelming. Mr.Moss offers an easy read of the fattening facts. His book would make a great textbook for late elementary and/or middle-schoolers.

1250037751|5.0|I would call this novel a roman a clef for Generation Google. Masked as a scifi-fantasy-slowmedia novel, Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is a very convincing story about how our present time functions with its strange mix of new and old media. Together with Daemon, Alif and The Circle, it belongs to the most important and visionary novels about the changes that lief ahead of us. Definitely a must read.

1250030951|5.0|I normally read Paranormal and Fantasy books but something about \\"Fangirl\\" kept catching my eye.  When I had the chance to read it for review I took it happily and dug right into the story.  I was tremendously affected by this novel.  This is the story of a girl named Cather who is just starting college and majoring in creative writing.  She is somewhat socially awkward but has a ton of friends onliine where she writes hugely popular fanfiction featuring Simon Snow (this Harry Potter) and his nemesis Baz (think Draco Malfoy).  She writes the fanfiction with the twist that they two boys have a thing for each other.  So Cather and her more popular sister Wren leave their single father alone and move into separate dorms at the fairly large public university.<br /><br />Wren quickly leaves Cather behind and she turns to parties and drinking.  Cather's social circle is confined to her new, older roommate Regan and Regan's boyfriend (one of them at least)Levi, and another guy who is Cather's class writing partner.  Cather deals with a lot of things all at once.  She deals with being outside of her comfort zone at college.  She is forced to write things that aren't fan fiction (the professor assures Cather that it is stealing since she hasn't created the characters and the world in which they reside).  She worries about Wren and she worries about her dad who has some mental problems.  Oh, and her mom is trying to worm her way back into the twin's lives after leaving them when they were eight years old.  Cather is utterly adorable.  Her awkwardness comes across as being legitimate.  The side characters are engaging as well.  Regan won me over pretty quickly and Cather's dad was an empathetic character.  But I think I may have fallen in love a little bit with Levi.  Levi was an incredible character.  He had actual faults.  He wasn't unnaturally handsome.  He grinned all the time and loves people.  He makes himself be happy and it rubs off on everyone else.  I don't read any books for romance.  If its a well written side plot though, I can enjoy what it adds to the story.  \\"Fangirl\\" has one of the cutest romances I have ever read.<br /><br />I seriously alternated between laughing aloud and tearing up several times during the course of this book.  Its not overly sad but the insecurities Cather faces just felt all too real to me. I have never written fanfiction but I have read it and I will admit that a lot of it is pretty bad but every once in awhile you find a real gem.  I had no trouble buying that Cather loved those fictional characters so much and from the clips we get to read woven throughout the book , Cather's fanfiction was far more entertaining then the 'actual' excerpts from the original books.  The fan fiction plotline was certainly something I have never read in a novel before and I thought that the way it was presented was a lot of fun.<br /><br />I could go on and one about what I liked about this book.  I am hard pressed to say what I didn't like because I felt like everything flowed well and of course, as I stated earlier, the characters were a delight.  Not everything was picture perfect at the end and that also is realistic.  I am now interested in reading other books by this author.  I am not a 'chick lit' reader in general but I think all fiction readers can find this one to be worth the read.books for romance.

B0017XD3OY|1.0|This movie is such a brutal, soulless, gutless betrayal of the original novel (the book that inspired Stephen King to become a horror writer) that you have to wonder if the director and the screenwriters ever actually read the damn thing.  Screw the movie, buy the book and get ready for one of the greatest horror stories ever told.
B003H6KRIE|4.0|Great way to see a set of good movies. This is one of the better trilogies made by Hollywood, Great sound and picture.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Of note in this book......<br /><br />1. His interpretation of the biblical story of David and Goliath. David's apparent weakness, smaller size, used to his advantage. Gladwell goes into other things where perceived weakness can give a person advantage. Also, other that for the top skilled students, it is better to go two a very good college than elite one. Better to be a big fish in a small pond than a little one in a big pond, so to speak. Also, a basketball team where players have less of the traditional basketball skills can have the advantage. Or, dyslexia can be an advantage. Or, a young person having a traumatic event, like death of a parent. Or, having a \\"remote miss\\" like surviving a bombing when bombs don't come clos can build a sense of invulnerability to tackle big  risks.<br /><br />2. The Inverted U-Curve - like best school class size is abt 20, much less bad, but also much more.<br /><br />3. Limits of Power - The Irish Rebellion of abt 50 years ago because British used too much power. CA's Three Strike Law made matters worse.<br /><br />Gladwell goes into other examples of these. So, an easy read, but also some excellent points.

B007EC27QM|4.0|This is a great basic calculator with memory functions and a few extra math buttons like sq. rt. when you SWIPE the memory buttons to the RIGHT. It has NO PERMISSIONS and does not need the internet to use. It was not billed as a scientific calculator so I didn't expect it to be. It would be nice to have landscape view and that dropped it a star. Sadly one would think a tutorial wasn't needed but many low star reviews prove otherwise.

1451695195|1.0|I purchased this book on CD to listen to in my car. I was driving home from a business trip and the book I was listening to ended and I had a few more hours of driving, so I stopped to buy another one. I had heard about this story on TV and was excited to start listening.  My first thought was that this man should have hired someone to read this rather than doing it himself, he definitely does not have the voice or tone for an audio book.  I listened for two or three hours and took the CD out and put it right back in the box. Maybe if I had read instead of listened to the book my review would be different.  Mr. Alexander sounded arrogant, which is a big turn off for me.  I normally buy my audio books through Amazon so I can listen to and excerpt before buying. The next time I go on a long trip I'll make sure I have an extra audio book with me.

B0063IH60K|4.0|One ad before each game, not bad for a free game. I haven't seen the problems others have. I've had this about a month. It isn't fancy - or complicated - just solitaire. There are a few settings, such as sound, appearance, scoring, one card or three. Just what I was looking for - solitaire, simple and free.

B008B68IV8|5.0|This was the very first Monster High doll I have ever purchased. The photo shows her hair being a simple flipped out pony tail but her hair is a big curly mass on her head. I have managed to actually straighten it completely on my own and it comes down past her hips. The glasses fit her beautifully without falling off and the zipper earrings are a fantastic touch!I love the train case box because it is hinged and is great for storing other accessories .Her dress is actually longer than another one in a set that I purchased separately and it is loose fitting but super cute! I love the hood detail! The hood doesn't fit over her head but I don't feel it takes away from the dress at all.It can be a little tricky to take on and off though so some care may be required if you are changing her outfits.The shoes weren't my favorite as the heels are very soft and flexible and the style is a chunky boot that I am just not a fan of with this particular outfit but they fit and aren't that bad. I can't wait to add more to my collection.

B0052BZ6X8|2.0|It wasn't enough like the book.Something about it just didn't grab you like the books did. I would say the development of the characters was poor or just not enough.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I love this book... it is so motivational and really works. A word of advice, in the beginning you may worry about your negative thoughts but keep reading the book puts you at ease.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is very easy to play.  Fun for all ages.  Free to download, so easy on the wallet. Try it out!!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like this game because is very entertaining. It make you think about where to go next. I spend a lot of good time playing. I will recommended to friends.
B00DJ735KI|4.0|An eyeopener and life changer. Thrilling until the ad for psych-k. That took some of the air out of the sails.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Well its a good weird movie at a good price. and go ahead and take time watching it again and again so you can see if its actually a dream or not.
B00C32R64G|5.0|Solid rock music with an Old West flavor. Musically, harmonically, and vocally on point. I can't get enough of it.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This movie was great. The &#34;new&#34; Star Trek cast does an outstanding job. All I can say is that it's well written, has great acting and is totally entertaining. If you love Star Trek. This is a must have for your collection.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Funniest show ever! I think Jenna Hamilton os the real not so cartoon version of Daria Morgandorfer.  I cannot wait to watch the next two seasons.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Got caught up with the series. Love the characters especially Calinda and Alicia's mom and brother. Calinda is so cool. Wish I had a brother like Alicia's.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|First, I have to admit I came to Firefly late in the scheme of things. When it was on TV the first time, I ignored it (or more correctly I'm not sure I even knew it was on). I have since become a rabid watcher (and re-watcher) of the program. The thing with Firefly that makes it work, I think, is the dialogue. Sometimes science-fiction programs loose an audience because the technical or fantasy aspect of the plot requires characters to do all the stories exposition in conversation. They don't talk to one another so much as explain why things are happening in the story. This can feel very phony, or at the least reminds one these are characters--not real people. Firefly's cast not only come across as real individuals, but they way they talk works towards building a realistic world you get sucked into. Conversations in the show are laced with slang, inside jokes, and the kind of familiar language anyone will identify with as genuine. It POPS! It's a fun show, and worth watching. Be prepared though, like so many REALLY GOOD TV Sci-Fi this gem was canceled before it's time, so there is only one season and a movie to feed the obsession I am sure you will develop like so many of us have.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Nice touching story  You could really envision each character and how they must have felt especially Vivian and Molly.  Will be looking for more novels by Christina Kline.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I'm a professional podcaster and I teach other people how to podcast, too. I decided it was time to invest in better studio headphones. All my research around the $100 target pointed to the Sony MDR7506 as having the best balance of accurate sound reproduction, low leakage, portable size, and comfort.<br /><br />I tested a bunch of other studio headphones in this price range and I could also confirm that the MDR7506 seemed to have the most accurate sound and all around best headphones. They don't block as much noise as the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro, but they're still quite good (better than other pairs I tested).<br /><br />But with lower noise leakage means that you'll get more bone conducton if you speak while wearing the headphones. Thus, this makes it difficult for podcasting. I have to turn up the volume loud enough to overcome the bone conduction, but then all other audio is too loud and I risk more noise leak into my microphone.<br /><br />The MDR7506 is generally comfortable, but my head and ears do get sore after about two hours.<br /><br />Some of these may be personal issues, and I'll continue to test and report at [...]

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a wonderful series about life and change after WWI in an English Estate that says so much about sociological norms and the attachments people make as well as the effects of change on all of us as a world changes its social norms.  It is awesome.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game. I just wish you could keep your place when you exit and come back. It gets pretty difficult but that's what I was looking for.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I love this program and being able to print from my Kindle. I can print from web, docs, email, and photos. Use it all the time.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|As always, Josh Groban delivers words and music that are profound, moving, and life affirming. Listen to this master artist as a gift to your life.
B002XJZE6Q|4.0|Which, I hasten to add is not the fault of the seller, but of Brother for designing a machine, the MFC 9840CDW which is ponderously slow, and requires such expensive replacement parts on a much, much, much too frequent basis

B00E3IZIM0|3.0|For this 4-disk bundle (3D BL, 2D BL, 2D DVD, Special Features BL), the case only has two disk holders.<br />The 2DBL and 3DBL sit directly on top of the DVD and special feature BL, respectively.<br />Cheaper, but this arrangement is cumbersome and more prone to damage. Who's \\"clever\\" idea was this?<br /><br />I guess the box will just be an empty ornament on my shelf, and the disks safely filed away in an oversized jewel case. The ones with two disks on either side and a hinged center with a disk on each side. Like they SHOULD have used. Like this: [[ASIN:B002ROGIT4 Black Quad Disc Jewel Case]]<br /><br />Heck, even a folding cardboard sleeve wallet is better than what you get with this!
B000059T00|5.0|Lot of time ago, that I didn´t listened this songs.<br />Always I listened to Eric Clapton, but to remember the sound of Blind Faith, it is something special, wonderful, and bring the old but good Music to the present time.<br />Very nice CD

B007TVANDM|5.0|My daughter loved this story because she can read it and because Pete gets a little silly. I love it because it's a cute story, and Pete imparts wisdom to the reader at the end.<br /><br />Pete's shoes are the real stars of this book!
B00000I41J|5.0|I saiy that, because I have (i think) all the CD's of Miles Davis, John Coltrane and other like Joshua Redman, Kenny Wheeler, etc, but to listen and to have a lot of different songs and different Musician in only one CD it's great.<br />It is a very very good CD.

B004W1GCNC|5.0|It's been a nice change watching this series. It's fun to see what other countries were like in the early 1900's.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|But, not as good as 'fault in our stars' (the book I compare all of green' s books to!)  I loved Quentin, Margo..not so much.  She's frustrating and I didn't have enough time in the beginning to care about her like I should.  So this made the whole mystery slightly tedious.  But, Q and  his buddies are lovely, and Quentin is adorable, innocent, and in love:)  John Green has a way with words and kept me happy to the very last page.  Very satisfying ending, sweet story.
0385344333|3.0|This particular book was too predictable, so it wasn't enjoyed as much as a few others in the Jack Reacher series.  Normally look forward to each new book by Lee Child, but again, this one was a disappointment.

630542845X|5.0|\\"Powder\\" was the first of two films that came out in 1995-1996 dealing with a gifted individual who is super-smart and has paranormal powers; the second was \\"Phenomenon\\" with John Travolta. \\"Powder\\" is the superior. While \\"Phenomenon\\" is good, \\"Powder\\" reaches for greatness and, in some ways, achieves it.<br /><br />Sean Patrick Flanery plays a hairless albino teen in East Texas, nicknamed Powder, who's discovered living in a basement after his grandfather's sudden death. As a ward of the state, he is placed in a boy's school where his uniqueness stirs up trouble.<br /><br />For a film like this to work you have to buy into the character, and this is one of the movie's strengths. Flanery reveals his acting expertise in his utterly convincing portrayal of the gifted teen. Seriously, Flannery's Powder stands strong with the greatest misfits in cinema, like Nimoy's Spock and Hank's Forrest Gump.<br /><br />Actually, the acting is great across the board: Lance Henriksen as the hardened-but-open sheriff, Mary Steenburgen as a psychologist who grows to really love Powder (in a motherly way),Jeff Goldblum as a science teacher who's astonished, Bradford Tatum as Powder's main enemy at school, Brandon Smith as a redneck deputy who instinctively hates him, but actually fears him, and the beautiful redhead Missy Crider, Powder's fellow student and potential love interest.<br /><br />Roger Ebert dissed the film for a number of reasons, one being Powder's enemy's don't learn from him. On the contrary, one enemy makes a 180 after being enlightened, but ultimately reverts back to his former base mentality. This happens all the time in real life. On another occasion Powder does something miraculous and you can clearly see the change on his enemy's face -- the realization & acceptance. Whether this will prove to be a lasting change or temporary, we'll never know.<br /><br />Ebert also complained that Powder's electrical tricks upstage his emotional insights. Really? I think it's the reverse. While the electrical tricks are there to maintain the attention of those with cinematic ADHD, it's the film's potent insights that stay with the viewer. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the electrical tricks, but they're way too overdone to be realistic. At the same time, I understand why the writer/director (Victor Salva) included them -- this is a MOVIE, not real life; it's meant to transfer ideas AND entertain, and it does both pretty effectively.<br /><br />Ebert also griped that the ending is unsatisfying the more you think about it. Actually, the ending makes a powerful statement and is reminiscent of the spectacular translations of Elijah and Enoch in the Bible. Let's just say Powder was too good, too spiritual, for the simpleminded and mundane.<br /><br />I'm not saying the film doesn't have flaws or roll-your-eyes moments, but they can be overlooked in view of the big picture and the film's successes.<br /><br />As for the paranormal phenomena featured in the story -- like psychokinesis, telepathy, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls \\"the word of knowledge\\" -- although some of these are exaggerated in the film I have a secret:<br /><br />They're real.<br /><br />=========================<br /><br />The film was shot in SE Texas and runs 111 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: A-reverse.

098555780X|4.0|This book has some nice ties in it, however, his YouTube channel with video's is actually better for learning how to tie some of the braids, etc.  Some of the shots of what to do next in the book are hard to understand with just still pictures.  I can tell he didn't write the book to make money because you can go to his YouTube channel and get far more knots than this book offers and it won't cost you anything.

0756404746|3.0|Let me first say: I think Rothfuss is talented. I think he has a wild imagination, and I think he's a poet at heart. I was recommended this book by several friends when I expressed dismay at the world-copying phenomena of fantasy literature, and was ready to give up. They told me that this was different - this would change my mind.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while I agree Rothfuss is a stand-out, \\"The Name of the Wind\\" only confirmed everything I dislike about the fantasy genre. My thought in the end was, \\"Man, this guy is talented - I wish he had rewritten this book 2-3 times so it reflected his abilities\\". Here's why:<br /><br />1. Although the world may be \\"unique\\", overall I felt I was eating the leftover brains of a grown man who loved the Harry Potter series. A young man goes to a university to learn magic, he has a professor who hates him, a bully who dislikes him, and some evil warlord killed his parents. He's very clever and accidentally wins the favor of all his classmates. He finds close classmates who visit him in the medica after all of his crazy antics. The only difference is that Rothfuss isn't nearly as masterful at piquing our interest with mystery and intrigue along the way. The one time he does, with the escape of a professor from the school's prison (okay, so maybe I thought of Sirius Black) he gives the secret away one chapter later.<br /><br />2. The plotline is cliche' and uneventful. I literally said aloud what was going to happen at least a dozen times before it happened - \\"Let me guess, his love is going to walk in as he's with this other girl\\" - yup. I was always hoping for some really clever twist, but I constantly felt like I was reading 700 pages of pieced together movie-clips. A lot of cliche does not an original make. The initial conflict doesn't come into play until you've waded through hundreds of pages of filler where we learn about Kvothe's upbringing. Rothfuss continues to excuse the cliche' of the story by saying, \\"It didn't happen like in stories,\\" and then, inevitably...it happens EXACTLY like every other story you've ever read.<br /><br />3. The dialogue is overly clever and unrealistic. For all those praising the dialogue of the books and the characters as being \\"realistic\\", please just try reading it out loud and taking yourself seriously. It's way too poetic for real life (although Rothfuss continues to excuse the overly clever dialogue by saying, 'I couldn't think of anything clever to say, like in stories').<br /><br />4. Overall, the characters are one-dimensional. There's no interesting mixed motives, except for in Kvothe.<br /><br />5. The writing...Oh, the writing. Yes, Rothfuss has an imagination. But seriously, why does there need to be an adverb in every single sentence? Why does everyone have to say things \\"meaningfully\\" and \\"disparagingly\\" and \\"menacingly\\"? If you like good writing, this book will drive you crazy with the 1,000's upon 1,000's of adverbs. Because the dialogue needs to be explained, and the verbs are lame, Rothfuss fills in a lot of unnecessary metaphor and verbiage to make up for it. He probably could have cut 300 pages from the book just by condensing his phrases into well chosen words, rather than wandering metaphors and propped up simplistic word choices.<br /><br />6. The writing...again. The reason why writers are encouraged not to write their first novel in first-person format is that you're in high water danger for telling, not showing, the story. Unfortunately, Rothfuss constantly falls into this trap and explains his main character's motivations, thoughts and feelings rather than showing them to us. We get a lot of \\"I was embarrassed, so I flushed red,\\" rather than, \\"I flushed red.\\" This doesn't fly in third person (He was embarrassed, so he flushed red...)and the danger of writing in first person is that it feels a bit more acceptable. It's not. Show, don't tell.<br /><br />Why, then, did I not give this book 1 star? Because Rothfuss shows he has incredible potential with this book - his metaphors are unnecessary, but they show he's brilliant at connecting the dots. His plot is cliche', but he has some truly original ideas about the way magic works thrown in. Three stars is my belief, and hope, that Rothfuss will hone his craft and find a good editor in the future who will examine his writing with the care and honesty it deserves.

I loved the maturing and life processes Dan went through, and the relationships that grew in his life. It was easy to relate to Dan...we may not have his “gifts“ but we all have good and bad sides to us that we may or may not share. We´re all human. Could not wait to find out what happens next, but hated to see the book end. Thank you, Mr. King!
B003G4W49C|3.0|This is one case where the movie will likely be better than the book.  I am anticipating the visual effects of the screen, especially the scenes in the battle room.  I only gave this book three stars because I did not care about the characters.  There was just nothing to draw me in.  I only finished it because my son had recommended it.  Although the battle scenes were interesting, I was not impressed.  Maybe if the author had pursued more of a story line with the evil genius brother?  On a side note, I am amused that the alien race was referred to as buggers in light of the controversy surrounding the author's outspoken views on homosexuality.
B004XS97QS|5.0|One of the best shows ever! I LOVE the DOCTOR. He makes me all wiggly wobbly timey wimey after every episode
B005DJREGQ|1.0|For a show that is geared towards teens and young adults, it lacks any moral compass.  Main characters have multiple sexual experiences with little regard for consequences, lie to their parents, and treat each other so unkindly chalking it all up to &#34;normalcy&#34;.  The adult figures are portrayed as uninvolved morons who do drugs,  lack leadership, and by their own behavior make the highschoolers  seem intelligent.  Not a show I would encourage or suggest one watch.  Very AWKWARD.  We wonder why this generation is so morally bankrupt....television that desensitizes people this way is despicable!

I have this on dvd with the extras on it (without the new 2 interviews and location extra) and I'm glad to pick this one up. Mostly because of the Jamie Lee Curtis interview. It was really insightful.

B005DF2QMC|4.0|This product came in a timely manner just as it was supposed to.  The product was a little confusing at first but after reading the little bit of directions I got the hang of it.  I thought that this product would help make transferring cassette to cd faster however if the cassette is 90 minutes than it will take just that long to record the information on the computer before it being available to write on the cd.  On the bottom of the screen is a count on how much time is left to use the product what I don't know is what happens when the time that is alotted is over and there are more tapes to transfer to cd maybe somebody could answer that question.

B00377E5SG|4.0|Harrison Ford is no Humphrey Bogart.  Producers of the original recognized they were dealing with a fairy tale and played it that way.  This one tried to shoehorn the story into reality.
B000VI12ZS|4.0|Nice to get the Navajo Code Talker story out, but the facts are wrong and changes were made to capture audiences. This is a gruesome killing movie which loses it's depth by not delving into the \\"real story.\\" The Navajos dedication to the war effort, the Army's real plan and the interaction between the Code Talkers and their American \\"handlers\\" that needs to be told. This is NOT a simple gory war movie!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After waiting for this book to come out, it was just disappointing. The story was thin and drawn out and then we find its not over, there is another book, maybe two after this one.  I won't be catching up with Eva and Gideon, enough is enough. No need to draw this story out any further.
B00597A6NU|5.0|This is a great movie to give younger generations perspective on what it was like on a B17 during WWII.
B008JFUR10|2.0|I'll give it one more star for some awesome special effects; we are getting really, really good at imagining just what the Golden Gate bridge will look like when it collapses. Otherwise, it feels like one long cut scene from a video game, including the inevitable B-grade acting. This is what I used to imagine when watching Ultraman and Godzilla on TV, but then again I was 6 at the time. Rent this bad boy, but don't even think you'll watch it enough to justify buying it. Also, is it just me, or was this really aimed at the Chinese market?  I'd hate to use the word &#34;pandering&#34;... but you might, more than once.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written, well directed, well acted.  Beautiful scenery, captivating story.  The third season continues its intriguing tale, just as enjoyable as season 1 and 2.  This production alone makes Amazon Prime a good entertainment investment.<br />Bravo to the Brits.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A human story with real love, loss, and adventure. I would recommend this book to everyone, young and old, full of life or dreading your next day.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|like ALl the games in this seres...fun and challenging!!. this gsme to me is a little harder than the previous ones. Anyone looking for a challenge will not be disapointed!
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is a good game if you really don't have much to do. But the one thing that ducks is it does takes.forever and ur back and forth from room to room... but another good thing is if you have a child who likes to be attar he'd to their games for hours give them something that will make them use theirmind in a different way make them have to look for things and open their minds!!!
1595141715|5.0|A must read book. I would highly recommend it to everyone. A perfect example of how our words and actions affect others.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its a cool game also a lot better than Diamond Dash that's I got 2 say so gave it a 5 star
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Love listening and singing along. Can picture the movie scenes as the cd plays. Still amazed at the vocal talents of those actors. Great music for children of the eighties.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I loved how it worked for me and my wife just the way it is made to. Worth the money
B00AWKZSNM|5.0|This fills a niche that I find very useful. I am able to download photos from a camera or files from a hard drive and move them back and forth to my iPhone or iPad while on the go. Also useful for watching movies on my iPad without filling up the internal iPad storage.    I will advise, however, that this is a technical product and the interface may not be for everyone. For copying files back and forth, you need another app such as Goodreader that connects to the FTP service provided and can upload/copy files.    (Edit: The iUSBport app was not working when I wrote the review. It has since been updated, and does work, however, I still recommend using another app to conduct file transfers as iUSBPort app does not have the most intuitive interface.)
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is good and I really like playing and it really brings out the game of it ,but it's good,I'll recommend this to people
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is such an entertaining series.  I had a health problem all of 2013 and many of my friends told me I would enjoy this series.  Well, I really was not able to watch anything during  my treatments, but, this was a wonderful series to watch when I was able.  Once I watched season 1 and 2, I could not wait for season 3 to become available on demand so I just had to order it.  No, I am not sorry I did not wait!  Now eager for season 4 to come in 2014.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Extremely good fantasy. The books are always better than the tv shows or movies. Yay for the author and looking for more.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so excited to see that Candy Crush was finally on Amazon!!!  I am able to play my favorite game on my Kindle fire!! Love this game!!!!  =-)
B001GSTOAM|3.0|A good book though not one of those books that transcends time. It is a very practical, concrete handbook whose principles are tightly bound with the implementations of the current crop of popular programming frameworks, Java and C# (though mostly Java). Still, I consider it an essential read. Well written, extremely knowledgeable, full of clearly explained examples. As an architecture book I find it wanting. The chapter on concurrency is frankly shallow. The focus is very much at the level of micro-architecture. Other than that, really good stuff.
B007NZQU72|5.0|I don't remember where I saw the referral for this book, but I'm glad I did.  Continue to recommend to others.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|The backbone of this movie is a two male, one female love triangle.  Jay Gatsby (Robert Redford) is a non-rich American soldier with combat experience and awards for valor who meets and falls in love with Daisy (Mia Farrow), a beautiful and wealthy social butterfly.  Gatsby asks Daisy to wait for him, but she seizes an opportunity to join social climbers and marries wealthy Tom Buchanan (Bruce Dern).  Daisy and Tom muddle along in an unhappy marriage made tolerable for Daisy by Tom's frequent absences and uplifting for Tom by his frequent conjugal meetings with Myrtle Wilson (Karen Black), wife of gas station owner George Wilson (Scott Wilson).  Gatsby remains unmarried, keeps a huge scrapbook with clippings of Daisy's travels and socialite activities and will not quit thinking and dreaming of winning Daisy back.<br /><br />Living in Midwestern America, Nick Carraway (Sam Waterston) reads about mansion-building and wild social goings-on in the Northeast and moves into a cottage in Long Island to observe and satisfy his curiosity.  His cottage is next door to newly rich Gatsby's outrageously huge mansion.  Nick becomes Gatsby's best friend and confidant, giving the deepest possible insights into newly rich goings-on.  Early in the movie, Tom is portrayed as a fundamentally rotten person who regularly abuses Daisy who sticks with him to avoid losing her social standing.  Gatsby plays the role of a seldom seen, fabulously wealthy and refined gentleman with an Oxford University accent who throws huge outdoor parties that he watches through a window without attending, hoping Daisy will appear as a celebrant.<br /><br />As the movie develops from the beginning to an approach to the ending, almost everyone with a speaking role except Nick turns out to be a rotten person.  During the same interval, the masses of couples at Gatsby's parties seem to be highly educated airheads with almost identical behavior patterns, clothing, assumed superiority smiles and mechanically rehearsed Charleston dancing techniques.  Nick arranges for a meeting between Daisy and Gatsby, leading to their love being restored.  Tom sees that he is losing Daisy and learns to hate Gatsby.  Myrtle dies in an accident, Tom tells George it was caused by Gatsby, causing George to become allied with Tom in hating Gatsby.  The movie reveals two more violent events before ending.  Nick seems to be the lone wonderful person throughout most of the movie, but he slowly drifts toward becoming like those who surround him and in the last scene, Nick is forced to choose between promoting justice or casting his lot with the new friends he has made.<br /><br />The complexity of this film extends beyond its internal structure and into the realm of its lasting impact on its viewers, the cultures they live in and future generations.  One could think of it a classic love triangle, a historical account of uncaring and frantic wealth-builders in America's 1920s, a documentary on the pitfalls of inequality disguised as entertainment or something different as shaped by open-minded viewers.<br /><br />Bruce Dern as Tom Buchanan, Karen Black as Myrtle Wilson and Scott Wilson are perfectly cast and do excellent work as actors.  Mia Farrow as Daisy Buchanan goes all out to be the best Daisy possible, but with her limited body and oversized eyes does not look like someone the newly rich Gatsby would pine over for many years.  Robert Redford looks like the perfect Gatsby, but plays Robert Redford throughout.rsed Charleston dancing techniques.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|How cool to catch up with little Danny...one of Kings best books.  I couldn't put it down!  Another master piece for King.....as always...looking forward to the next!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The theme was new to me and captivating. King created so much suspense that I couldn't putit down. While clearly fiction, it was definitely believable. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys well written, complex thrillers.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The Capitol is back and in full force. You need to pick your side! Rebels are on attack! Great book and keeps you wanting more.
B00E8G5H6Y|1.0|This is a fantastic show, and S5 is incredible!  But WARNING---- The blu ray set is not synced properly by Warner Bris., so most episodes have the problem where the characters' dialogue doesn't match their mouths.  This is a large topic of discussion in many forums right now, so it's a widespread problem.  Keep this in mind when ordering.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This is the 4th or 5th time i have watched this film in the past few years. There is nothing more creatively inspiring than surrounding the self w creative genius and Dylan's prose is just that. When life feels meaningless and shallow, this film reminds me of what is important. It is truly a masterpiece.
0753827662|3.0|I seldom read popular fiction - the plots are too contrived, the characters too superficial. But this was recommended as being well written, which it was, with a well thought-out plot and sound insight into the disintegration of a marriage, which it had, initially.<br /><br />It is written in the first person, alternate chapters switching between husband and wife, Nick and Amy, giving their take of events. We meet an intensely irritating, bubbly bimbo in Amy, with her syrupy diary entries. Had there not been the relief of Nick's down-to-earth accounts alternating with Amy's, I may have baled without finishing the book. However, the package was engaging enough to hold my attention sufficiently to race to the finish line in record time, although I was starting to flag two-thirds in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even though Gillian Flynn uses language and grammar well (with alerts to the simple-minded reader that she is doing so), the story unravels as it progresses, climaxing in a rather disappointing and far-fetched finale.<br /><br />This may not have been her best work, so when I am in the mood for a light read in future, I may consider one of her earlier books.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|What a great sequel to the shining,I couldn't put this book down and can't recommend it highly enough,Stephen king at his best
B00DOPEGAS|4.0|The product was good however the clips you need to complete the braclet were not in the box as stated so alittle disappointing

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Love the game can't get enough. Keeps you thinking and always guessing.  Wish energy replenished faster.  Hope they keep adding pictures.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A great story, well told from an interesting perspective. The characters were so real... they just pulled me in and never let go. Made me cry! Can't wait for the movie.
B007EC27QM|4.0|It's not that this calculator doesn't follow the order of operations... It's that the developer didn't build in the logic.  It's an adding machine.  Plain and simple.  When you type in 2+2*4, you get 16 since it does the math on 2+2 as soon as you press *.  No need for it to do OOO if it's an adding machine (you should try using a real one...).<br /><br />Overall, this app does what it should.  The description needs some clarification.  It should tell the user that it behaves the way that it does and that is it's intended behavior.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because I feel that the description is lacking but the app does what it was designed to do.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As a lifelong King reader, I've been a little disappointed in the past decade.  But - Doctor Sleep has awakened the beast!  I think this was an outstanding sequel to The Shining.  Interesting, creepy, and I loved it.  Reminded me of the best of The Stand and It.  Read it!
B0036S4B6M|1.0|Interesting characters,interesting events, strung together with a sixth grader writing style.  If you thought this would be anything like the well scripted tv show you wil be extremely disappointed
1609611543|5.0|I read this book and started the program. By the third wheat free day I had no symptoms of really chocking at night reflux which I had for 2 years. I got others in the house on it without their reading it. They would report how they felt and what was happening and it all checked out with the book. Have lost 20 pounds in 4 months and am going for another 10. Several friends at work are trying it and feeling good about the results.<br />Not a wonky technical read (except one chapter of &#34;official&#34; data)

B000ICXQHE|4.0|This is another great Denzel Washington movie with a great supporting cast in Jodie Foster and Clive Owen (One of Clive Owen's bet roles). There is a lot of foul language, so if that's not your thing I wouldn't recommend this one. Otherwise, this is a great movie.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app usually works fine. There is the occasional update popping up but you have to go back to the app store to update it. When you click to update it goes to the Google store. Sometimes the news feed doesn't load when you get farther back down the feed. Overall it works pretty good.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I don't have cable so I purchase the season pass from Amazon. The video quality is excellent and I love how the episode is available the next day after it premieres on AMC.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app because I can use it on all of my devices and pick up and read where I left off no matter which device I use!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Price these out in the stores and you see exactly what you are saving.  Plus they are sony and how can you ever go wrong.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Not as good as the shining but then what could that be anyway.  It was really fun to revisit the site of the overlook hotel.  Abra is a very strong character.  Overall a really great addition to the Stephen king library.
B0019K06WM|5.0|this cd is another discovery from my exploring the planet earth rock and roll orchestra . back in the early 70's a loose group of gifted musicans from around california got together in san fran. at the wally heider studios and made a pile of music together. this cd is one of those fine efforts. nash and crosby went on to become well recognized and prolific artists. beautifully played and sung, this cd represents their music interests and styles perfectly. a gentle acoustic sound that is a lovely change from the over the top, over produced stuff coming out today. if you find you enjoy this like i do, there are many more releases that represent this point in time very well. the \\" perro sessions\\" is one i would highly recommend as well as any of their group or solo projects from the 70's .. cheers !!
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|As usual, Stephen King delivers.  He draws you into the story and keeps you there.  I reread The Shining first and like all of SK's books, it was like revisiting an old friend.  It was fantastic to learn what had become of the characters from the first book.
B00AH6CCK8|5.0|I haven't heard this album in over 10 years. Fell back in love with it when I stumbled upon the video of the show on youtube. Simply one of the best rock shows ever.

B00BAXFDLM|5.0|The story was very interesting, even though it was hard in times to follow the plot.<br />An original story that was well told.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|Never tire from watching it. Shared it with select people at my office and we recite lines from the best parts of the movie all the time. It's not for everyone though. Plenty of raunchy language, but if you're not easily offended I'd recommend it. Definitely not for kids.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I like dd on my iphone but on kindle fire it didn't load correctly the sound was atrocious and the scoring was off. Uninstalled it.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I've never been so impressed by a flashlight before.  This thing is incredible.  The beam that it puts out is like a freaking mind melting laser!  I don't normally get excited about flashlights, but the Fenix TK41 is awesome!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book has it all. Political intrigue, battles, brotherhood, coming of age, the mystical, romance and most of all, a hero we all can relate to. The world (Realm) that we are drawn into is well described and the storyline engaging. The author builds the story, chapter to chapter, as we see a boy abandoned by his father maturing into a leader of men. The use of a third person perspective, via a historian, is intelligently used to help link story lines and offers a different perspective from the historian's viewpoint vis a vis the protagonist's unfolding of his story. The book is very well written, concise and well edited.<br /><br />Overall, I fully enjoyed the book and the conclusion left me wanting to know more of what happens to Vaelin. Kudos to the author.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Wonderful story of a very gutsy American Hero. He and all the Navy Seals are really the elite of all our warriors.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the puzzles to figure out. My kids like to go back & do all the levels again & again.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|A hopelessly average novel.  I had hoped for so much more.  Perhaps it is less King's fault then my own expectations.  I am a huge fan of The Shining so I had high hopes for this sequal.  The book added a bunch of new characters and a new antagonist.  I guess the ghouls and ghosts weren't enough.  Do not get me wring, this was an ok story if judged on it's own merits.  But as a sequel to the shining is left me cold and just a tad bored.  The early parts of the novel that focused on Danny growing up were great but the book falls off from there.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Cool movie with multiple heros and great for kids who like superheroes.<br />An excellent story with plenty of action making a great addition to the instant streaming selection.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Long time looking for an alarm clock secure. Great when I go traveling because it is included on my tablet, so no need to bring an extra clock! Good I can select my music for the Alarm, not just noisy sounds!!!

B00BT1XCOU|1.0|No information was given on the item as to the region.  it does not play in numerous DVD players at home here in Australia.  It says it is the wrong region.  very disappointed that no information regarding the region was given on the item for sale before we purchased it!  We are not willing to pay at least another $15 to ship the item back to USA.
1250038820|5.0|Brandon Stanton definitely gets it!. We need more people like him.. He has truly captured the heart of NY.. The softer, sweeter side.. I follow other photo journalists on Blogger and Brandon has just that extra something.. You can tell by the sensitivity he can pick up in the expressions of those he has photographed... Joy, sadness, pain, contentment... its all there in his first and hopefully not last pictorial book.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This story has a bit of everything in it. I felt spent after reading this book because the writer just takes you along on a suspenseful journey of thrills, love, murder, growing up and suspense. He does a very good job building the characters and their roles in the story. It's action filled romance, but as a man reading this I throughly enjoyed it.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Season One an instant addiction! Good story line, lots of twists and turns and fantastic acting.  A must see! Highly recommended.
B008V59AF2|5.0|In my eyes, Peter Gabriels musics does no wrong.<br />His smooth voice and tempo can't be beat.<br />However...Orginal LPs have more than 13 songs on them, so why are we being shorted?

B002YE452Y|5.0|Her singles She Wolf, Why Wait, and Gypsy are great and sound unlike any other songs you've heard before! And her other singles Did It Again ft Kid Cudi, and Give It Up To Me ft Lil Wayne will make you want to get up and dance while pressing repeat over and over again!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun but not very challenging. I would like to see more difficult puzzles and levels.  The graphics are good. I like the concept.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I havnt played in months because of all of the syncers but I log back in now and all my chars are 20 + lvls lower and all my gold is gone. Just lost a long time player
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Think it's great. Keeps my device clean and running fast. Hope this helps some other buyers. Especially since this is to my knowledge ad free
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Updated 5/11/15: Not sure why I had to talk to a friend to figure this out, but once I did it worked fine. Use the extender for poor WIFI connections as it adds antenna length.  Also cell phones have a setting to check the internet connection with that needs to be turned off manually. Hopefully they updated the documentation and FAQs to include this.<br /><br />Between these issues and with the software updates that have been happening I am changing my review to 5 stars. Google keeps supporting it and now with HDMI control support it makes things much easier for setting up the amp automatically based on when something is shared.<br /><br />I tried setting this up with 5 different items...4 Cell phones and a MAC.<br /><br />It tells you to point your browser to the setup page. Once you do this I makes you download Chrome if you don't have it.  I understand this is necessary for it to function, but why do I have to download and install Chrome on my MAC to find out it is NOT SUPPORTED.  I tried to proceed anyway and it failed.  OK, try a phone.<br />I point the chrome phone browser at the URL, and now it wants me to install chromecast on my phone from the playstore.<br />I do this and try to configure the chromecast, but my Android phone keeps telling the the chromcast network is not reliable and disconnects from it before I can finish configuration.  I turn off the auto-netowrk switching and try again, this time it tells me my password was wrong...it was not.<br /><br />I tried from several different devices and never successfully connected it to the internet.  I received various error messages when setting it up. Most times it &#34;Could not connect to my wireless network&#34;. When it would connect &#34;it was not able to establish a connection to the internet&#34;.  All in all a waste of $35.  Seems like most of Google's other products...BETA.<br /><br />I love the idea this is, but I am fairly technical and was not given a way around the issues I encountered and it frustrated me.  I may try this product again if they can figure out how to make the setup work.  I think they tried to dumb it down more than they should have. Provide an alternative to setup and I may change my rating.igure out how to make the setup work.  I think they tried to dumb it down more than they should have.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I couldn't wait for this game to come to the Amazon app store and it doesn't disappoint. The only thing that is stopping me from giving this 5 stars is that I have to wait for a half an hour to try a level again if I run out lives and that gets annoying ,but this game is still great get it you will love it.
0060936223|5.0|&#34;Just Kids&#34; is at once shocking and tender.  Beautifully written.  Theirs was a remarkable friendship and Patti Smith is a remarkable woman.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|Classic Drake never lets me down. Note males should not always act like they don't care. Living top 5 1jayz 2wayne 3pushat 4fab 5drake
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like this app. I review it at least once a day and have found the predictions are more accurate than other sites or apps.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It's a great book very interesting lots of words but very long took almost two weeks to finish<br />But it was worth it
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I will always love the shining and have always wanted Steven king to write a follow-up to it.  This book was what I expected from Stephen he always keeps you wondering what happens next nobody is ever safe and that is what is so exciting about his books I am so glad he has been writing again he writes so you can understand what he knows you need to know it's a pleasure to read his books everyone has to read this book especially if you read the shining.  Keep writing thanks.
B004WMKSH2|3.0|Well, it was not as much fun as theoretical ones.  It was slow and drawn out without much of anything happening but struggles between Harry, Hermione and Weasley. The last two films could have been made into one.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I give it a 5 because it really shows all the little words and gives you big definitions I am really helped by this book.I would recommend it to people who have a disability to understand things or maybe even dyslexia.Thank you for reading.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is one of my favorite authors. I totally enjoy most of his books. Living in Maine, he has a great writing skill
0307474275|5.0|The popularity of this book is unquestioned because it make even the most religiously devout individuals think and ask questions that they normally wouldn't ask.  High quality read.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|This movie reminded me of Robocop, except that the Judge had no personality and the storyline sucked. Don't waste your time.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Jeremy Irons is the perfect actor for this role. I've seen other series/movies and they don't stand up to the entire cast, playwrite, etc.
1439190976|4.0|interesting partly inside view why McK is McK and what they do and did - the story on american and global consulting
B00594XOZU|3.0|It worked for a little bit. Then it like crashed or something and wouldn't let me log in or type and wouldn't send my messages and it just stopped.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I cannot remember enjoying a novel more than this one. I was laughing out loud while my husband was wondering what I was reading. Then profound sadness from which I could not stop reading in fear my sleep would be disturbed. Understanding the serious of depression, I felt for Jamie.<br /><br />Christina McKenna.......very well done!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to come out for so long.it was worth the wait.it is so much fun.
B0040QYROA|4.0|I have always considered Fritz Lang one of film's premier storytellers. Early in his career, he the filmmaker's tools to their utmost advantage. &#34;Metropolis&#34; was a most impressive film even in the incomplete form which it had for decades. This new, virtually complete, edition only enhances its quality. Certain scenes and characters (notably the 'Thin Man') make much more sense now. I am especially pleased that the original score is used. I am glad that I decided to replace my older DVD with this edition.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Enjoyed this book a lot . My first time reading this author and I look forward to reading some of her other books
B008VO3PA4|5.0|If you have ever loved a cat, you will relish getting inside those inscrutable, furry little heads to see what's up in there.  I am still chuckling.  A great gift for you cat-loving friends!
B004RCUJ9E|3.0|What is there to say?  It is checkers... checkers... checkers... It is probably raining outside where you are at, or you are fighting going to sleep.  Or maybe you finished the book you are reading... It is only checkers.. :)
B00005N6KG|1.0|The headphones broke after 3 months of gentle use, no sound comes out, and unable to return.  I thought I was buying higher quality by the price, guess not.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Extraordinary on every level.<br /><br />A must buy, a must see.<br /><br />One of the greatest movies ever made!<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.
B00E9E4EC8|4.0|I'm not particularly fond of Bluegrass but do like Alan Jackson.  I thought this album was nice but not really a standout.  Nevertheless, folks who like Alan will like it.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Great story with pace and adventures. A few twists and surprises, including a couple worthy of Jeffrey Deaver!  I liked the way that &#34;Practical Pig&#34; was the link between the different themes without it becoming disjointed.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have installed the cloud player on all my devices, which was easy and no issues encountered.  Able to play my music any where.  If you like music then you will like this!
B008PU8SR4|5.0|After all the stories with well balanced people as their heroes, this book written from the viewpoint of a boy with interaction problems is a refreshing change. My teenagers loved it's humour and style. It made them think about the needs of people who are &#34;different&#34;.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The author carefully weaves her story, then unravels it with a series of surprises and puts it all back together again.  Very well done.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Probably the best hidden object game I've played for a long time. Lots to think about,plan ahead to get the best possible result
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|This album has a great spirit about it. If you enjoy John Mayer's many musical talent, this album is for you. Definitely some folk and country twang in a lot of the music with his usual guitar jam additions. Would never know he had vocal issues due to his surgery. This may be one of my favorite JM albums since Continuum.
B001D1SRRS|5.0|Although this book was required reading in my first days at Saturn Corporation, I still have positive memories of it being one of the more enjoyable of all my technical education reads of my engineering career. It really helps when an author can take an engineering process and bring it to life. The fact that he could describe the process by relating a supposedly non-technical event was amazing; and perhaps why it was so enjoyable. Education can be fun when approached right; and this author did that.<br /><br />Now that I'm writing books, I hope I can relate to my own readers as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|really fun mostly when u have a facebook because u can see where ur friendz are and if ur beating them. if you don't have a facebook its still fun. :D
B003DS3GC0|4.0|Difficult subject matter. I liked it but I don't think the court room scenes were realistic. Good performances though. Especially by the young men who played the younger versions of Brad Pitt, Jason Patric and the others.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|In the beginning I was discouraged that Danny, a character I had loved so much in The Shining, had fallen to such depths. But isn't that real, if a child had really gone through what he had, wouldn't he have emotional baggage to deal with?  As he learns to get his life back on track and use his skills to help others, the story took off.  In the end, a very satisfying tale.
B004HWYTP4|1.0|Poor choice and a waste of $1.99. Stay with Die Hard. Stay away - away - far away. Please and please
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|51 was too old for this character.  Should have been 41.  Still enjoyed the book.  It was like catching up with an old friend.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This one definitely makes you think!  There is a pretty steep learning curve on this one.  It has taken me a while to figure out how to find each little thing that is needed to get out of each room.  I would say that this is not the game for you if you get frustrated easily.  I will keep playing because I do love a challenge but it is not for everybody!  I rated it at a 3 because it isn't exactly user friendly!!
1608871517|5.0|If you are a Michael Jackson fan, don't miss this book!  His wardrobe played a big role in his performances and in the making of The King of Pop.  Read about it all...and enjoy the eye popping pictures.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I finished the book 9:57<br />.and ending was great like start and middle. never really tells alot about bear though.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|Love thecombination of funky blues and rock.,a couple of very beautiful slow songs. would recommend it to everyone! My 20 y/o likes it too.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|If you're hating life, you'll love this book.  The author has been through it all and gives some great insight on how to refocus professional direction in a changing business landscape.
B000001DVD|5.0|so glad to have this in CD.. wore out my cassette tape :)ha ha missed listening to this collection so purchased it in cd
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This app was overdue. There was a general out pour from all that this was not available until now. I would give this 5 stars except it still wants to sell you stuff in order advance to new levels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that this is finally on the kindle!!!!!!!!!!! We have been waiting for this for so long<br /><br />Yay !
B00DJYK9ZU|5.0|I can't even remember the last time I paid for a CD but when I heard some of the songs on this album and the way The Lumineers tell their stories I just had to show my support.  Every song on the CD is great and while it's possible to get the songs for free I felt they deserved my money.  Hopefully they release another CD soon.  Can't wait to hear what's next.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game on Facebook and I have been waiting not so patient for it on my Kindle.  Thank you so much Amazon for getting it.  Now I just need Pet Rescue Saga and Farm Hero Saga and I'll be one extremely happy lady.
