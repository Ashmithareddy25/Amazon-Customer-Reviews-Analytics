B008XG1X18|4.0|Love it but the app doesn't always open. Easy yo navigate through and allows you to save your favorite ideas!
B008F5YDRI|4.0|The love story elements were somewhat predictable until the end when your not quite sure who will win out.  Likeable characters
B008B3F38C|4.0|Good rock music. clean sound. beautiful vocals. I really like this album and intend to buy some of their previous albums.
B002KS1IJC|2.0|The plot line on this is plain silly and predicatable from the trailer from beginning to end.  However, I did watch the whole thing.  Some of the lesser character actors were enjoyable and gave a kind of humor to the story that made the interplay between characters \\"fun\\". In retrospect, the plot was distracting and the characters were fun, but couldn't carry the film for the whole movie.<br /><br />One last note.  I usually enjoy Caviezel but not this time.  The movie took itself too seriously.  It would of been better with a \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" feel and have more fun with the plot.
B004AQR24W|5.0|Just exactly what i paid to watch, consider the actors, the subject matter, plot, and you realize this is why the movie was made. To entertain, to give us the Win, something to make us feel exceptional again. looking forward to seeing #2
B006WAIV6M|4.0|Definitely a must read for those interested in the mind and psychology of motivation. well written with witty anecdotes and stories told to establish a point. this keeps reader interested!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book the author did an amazing job writing the story line.  The authors descritions of details is amazing.  I would recommend this book to the mature reader.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book was an enjoyable trip with the author as she made her gutsy physical and emotional trip. She is inspiring and I look forward to the book discussion with my book club. Well written.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Love it. Works well and on top of it u can edit the things u download!!! Better app than Freedi.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The book kept my interest and had great plot & character development. I generally stick with authors I like and I like David Baldacci.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|If you enjoy watching good comedies,then try this one!  It stars Goldie Hawn,Bruce Willis and Meryl Streep who just happen to be 3 of my favorite actors. This movie is about greed, vanity and immortality in a hilarious written and performed movie. Watch it and enjoy the laughter throughout its entirety. ENJOY!!!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Like all of Flynn's novels, Sharp Objects is sure to keep you flipping the pages in suspense. I never would have expected the ending.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I heard this was a good book but I honestly didn't like it.  I don't know if it was just not my taste but I thought it was weird and just didn't like it.
B005ONTD42|5.0|Fun lil toy to fool around with. I Don't have any pets but I imagine this would be a great pet toy. Still, its entertaining. If I had one suggestion I'd suggest to have an autonomous mode so it just freely drives around on its own
B008JAGZDE|5.0|It was great to see how life turned out for the group! Funny, but touching...especially with some of the interactions between Jim & his dad. I really enjoyed it!
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved reading this trilogy.  The author really made me think about social issues.  It opened my eyes to how I react to others.  I feel this series of books has change my perspective of my place in the world.  Don't just watch the movie read the book.
B0088TG252|4.0|Intense movie. Action packed. Denzel Washington does everything well, and Ryan Reynolds is even believeable, as a frustrated CIA agent.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Best movie I've seen in quite some time.  I don't understand the negatives.  Must be from folks who have never read any John Carter stories I guess.  But it's been so long since I read them that I don't remember much but that they were good books.  To anyone who didn't enjoy the movie, I strongly urge you to read the books and then try this movie again.  Excellent stories and this movie did them justice.
B0036UMM84|5.0|I have watched this amazing movie a million times. Outstanding performances by Kris and Barbara. A must see flick. Very romantic.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|Fun, mouthwatering movie.  It's slightly different than the book but still gets the story across.  If you're a chocolate lover you'll definitely love it.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Fantastic movie! Definitely not for anyone under 15, but overall fantastically done! Would certainly recommend this to any movie lover
0307341550|4.0|I was looking for something engaging and I found it. Kind of dark in a non usual sort of way. Interesting twist at the end, not what I was expecting. Very interesting. I liked it a lot! Dark places is also a \\"must read\\"!!!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is a fantastic book! Kept me engaged throughout....eager to reread - cannot wait for the next part.  George, get busy!
B0060BHUXI|5.0|The cd did not disappoint.  I went and saw il divo in concert, 8 rows back, center stage and no big heads in my way!  I was never a fan before the concert but now I can't get enough. Product arrived quick.
B008602KQI|4.0|I was somewhat disappointed in the content, as I had waited so long to get it.  I read all three books and the dvd had eliminated some key points that made one more aware of the nuances the books put across. Nonetheless, it was well done, if you had not read the books first.
B008602KQI|5.0|I saw this in the theater and liked it so much I wanted the dvd. I have read all three books and can't wait for the next movie to come out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I liked the fact that the novel is written in the first person from two perspectives.  The author keeps the reader guessing throughout.  I heartily recommend Gone Girl.  A great read!
B0060CV6ZA|4.0|A very dark Walt Disney movie. I bought it to bring back memories and it sure did! :) The acting is very good, storyline is dark and twisty. Best for older kids 10+.
B0088TG252|3.0|Video not clear at times. A lot of buffering during play of the movie. Not the highest quality of video.
B008M36EEI|5.0|This is a delightful film with a good strong story and attractive characters enmeshed in life's conflicts.  The background -- gorgeous parts of Great Britain and the deserts and oases of Yemen (or a substitute thereof) --adds to the film's flavor.  The gentle humor and a of the protagonists adds a special dimension to what is basically a romantic tale of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, etc.
B002ZCLH5S|5.0|Awesome film!  Always loved this one growing up.  Still a good film after all this time.  Glad to see I could get it direct to my tv too  :)
B002SSBD6W|5.0|What a great, informative book.  I was blown away.  I had no idea, and truly believe that mainstream society has no idea about the meat industry in America.  I pray that more people become aware of it, and I now waste no opportunity to share what I know with others.  Choices I make will forever change because of this book.
B0044LHN0G|5.0|A \\"Must Have\\" for the Movie Score collector. This amazing score by John Williams is breath taking from start to finish.  This score is unlike anything I have ever heard from John Williams.  His gift of music never ceases to amaze me.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I watch many movies and find this app very helpful in letting me know whether or not I should charge my Kindle Fire.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|very good but i liked book two the best two keep me on the edge of my seat book three did in some parts but not like two
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I was surprised to see such a variety of pleasant sounds that I'm sure it will be one of my favorite apps.Very calming.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this was the best book out of the three for me i couldn't put my kindle down i read two in a day and a half the other two i was about four days finishing them
1466401885|5.0|Do yourself a favor and read this book! Once you start you cant put it down.<br />I loved this book
B0011EU0NG|5.0|My grand daughter and I have watched it several times and we love it. So nice to see a fun movie that any age could enjoy. No foul language, no sex scenes...just good old fashioned fun with singing. Aaaawwwww!....the good old days. So glad to have you back. You've been missed.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Suprisely fresh for having been a children's movie 40 years ago!  No demons but plenty of monsters (in human form), no violence other than goofy cartoon villians and suprise **a car chse or two! for this GLEE generation, revisting a old classic with wonderful songs and dancing is well worth it.
B008JAFXOQ|5.0|Margaret, in the 3-hour cut by director Lonergan (and I saw only that so can't speak for the 2.5-hour release version) has scenes of such extraordinary emotional reality that I almost couldn't believe that such a film was possible.  It's not really about that much, maybe truly learning that there are, as Damon's character points out, 7 billion people in the world, which means that your little adolescent psyhcodramais not the most important thing out there, but the truthfulness and intensity with which it presents this simple truth is staggering. Best screenplay of the decade without a doubt, with one of the best performances (by Ms. Paquin. There are things to quibble about (the stuff with the lawyers in the second half does get tedious), but this is indeed something rare and beautiful.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Great! Was pleasantly surprised just how much we enjoyed this movie!!!  Will watch it again. Was actually very riveting. Hits the heart. Horses are such powerful animals.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|the movie was very good very close to the book the cast was almost perfect love donald southerner as pres.snow
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Nice low key British flick - easy to watch, good chemistry between leads. Especially enjoyed the location filming and various UK accents.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|This is a great ACTION movie. Was excited from the first scene to the last! The acting is what it is for a movie of this type, but the fight scenes are well done...
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I am addicted to Dexter.  I watched for hours and couldn't stop.  The writers do the most creative job of creating complex characters and meshing unexpected, unpredictable plot lines.
B0086700CM|3.0|A bit glitchy at times and the never ending games can be frustrating, but for the most part, it's a fun way to pass the time. Beware if you have little ones playing; my 3 year old managed to buy $20 worth of coins!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Very Erotic - However the plot really didn't give you your bang for the buck. I followed the crowd and read it - I was waiting for some real twist ormuch better story line.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a great read and was not predictable like most books are anymore! I would definitely recommend this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book. Couldn't put it down. Hope there is a sequel, it would be great to see how their lives play out.
B008602KQI|4.0|I think the movie is great; however, there was lots of very important details left out from the book.  They also changed a few things that I disagreed with, like how Katniss came to own the Mockingjay pin.
B008N1LL42|4.0|This was a fun film. Loved the action, the heroes (although the little brother was annoying) and the aliens. FINALLY someone made them look at least somewhat plausible. I'm SICK of seeing frightening aliens that could not possibly create the complicated machinery they arrive in. It had awesome graphics and plenty of heroic moments. Patriotic films come along too few and far between. It was a great story, plot and a liiittle cheesy, but hey! It was definitely worth renting if not purchasing when the price is right. I'd watch it again.
B008602KQI|5.0|While Hunger Games is thoroughly 'entertaining', it goes beyond that. Hunger Games brings an inciteful view of today's real world of Hunger Games. We think Panem and The Capitol are merely fantasy. We think the Hunger Games scenario is ficticious. We think the despotic, parasitic grip of The Capitol on the common people could never happen to us. Hmmmm, look around. Then contemplate societal history. Then re-read The Hunger Games, watch the DVD again.... and ask yourself about the similarities between Katniss's world, and the real world we live in. The Hunger Games is an thoughtful book, and the movie doesn't disappoint. Very well-written, well planned....both the book, the screenplay, the movie. It is NOT a book (or movie) that gratuitously features children killing children. It goes far beyond that. Children killing children is NOT what this trilogy, or the movie, is about. Not by a long shot. Suzanne Collins has a message embedded in her trilogy. I applaud her. Gary Ross is a brilliant director. His artistry translated the book's written words onto the big screen with no lack. I wasn't disappointed, having read the trilogy first. The bonus disc of \\"extras\\" has great information about the making of the movie, along with a segment about Donald Sutherland's letter to Gary Ross, which shed new light for Gary. I recommend both the triolgy (books) and the movie. However, I think parents should read it, and see it, before they allow their children to partake.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|I watched this film for my husband. We take turns watching guy/chick flicks. I like Guy Pearce. He looks like he'll be 30 something FORever. The dialogue written for him is hilarious if you like dry humor. It had lots of action, plot twists and most of the other actors did a great job. The female lead (starred in \\"Lost\\") was just 'eh, but didn't deter from the movie.<br />I watched it twice in two days and enjoyed it just as much, if not more, the second time around. Since I knew what was going to happen, I watched for hints to the surprise twists at the end. I really enjoyed it (and I'm a chick!).
B002JIOOB2|5.0|when i bought this i had only heard of the tv show, then i started watching it and found that i love the show i have watched it all over and over again love it !!!!
B008CP93S0|2.0|I was hoping it was going to be a funny movie. A lot of people from The State were in it so I knew it was going to be funny. Not so much. It had moments. I love Paul Rudd and thought he could be the reason the movie would be great...he wasn't. I enjoyed watching the movie but probably won't watch it again.
B008ODZNLG|4.0|Had to eat at the most expensive sushi bar after watching this. Very inspirational an refreshing to see people do what they love and take so much care in every detail.<br /><br />Beautifully shot and musically scored
B003719G40|5.0|I read this book out-loud with my partner.  It helped us realize why we sometimes were on the wrong page.  It helped identify our individual needs and gave inspiring advice on how to help meet each other's needs.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|Love this whole series. A real \\"and meanwhile in.....\\" approach to continuing this great journey.Can not wait to read the next installment.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I'm self-employed - which sometimes means people can take the time they want and go to the gym as long as they want, etc. But it can also mean, as in my case, you can never take that much time off, because every minute away from work is a minute lost. So, although I love to workout, I can't get to the gym to do it. Jillian Michael's system is just right for me to do it at home and even when I travel. It's intense, makes the best use of my time, and gets the job done. I also need to have someone there talking me through it, so I keep my mind off my body's complaints. And even though I didn't really need to lose any weight, I can feel the muscle toning going on. I feel stronger and more flexible. It feels great!
B00846REIS|2.0|It was too similar to Fifty Shades of Grey. I won't download the remaining two in the series. It was not too bad.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|very good book..a bit toned down from the first...but a very good story and nice ending. Hoping for another one....
B007IXWKUK|4.0|There are very saucy and captivating stories within the story.  It makes you wonder who really is Christian. Also, can one be so complex and innocent at the same time.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|I did not watch this series when it was on the air, so just recently became interested in it and slowly went through all six seasons borrowed from my local library...<br /><br />I found the ending to be of mixed quality. After reading many of the reviews by other fans here and at other websites I agree with most of what you've all said both positive and negative.<br /><br />The thing that struck me most about the series about half way through, say in the third season, was that it really had no clear direction. In the opening seasons it was the survivors of Oceanic 815 against Ben and the \\"others\\" but then sides changed, loyalties changed, crash survivors went from one group to another constantly, and everything became very blurred in terms of direction and \\"good\\" vs. \\"evil\\". Then they threw in time travel, god-like beings interacting with the islanders on a personal level, nuclear bombs going off, multiple time lines etc. and it became even muddier.<br /><br />So about half way through watching this series I realized that the writers were really doing what we used to refer to in grade school as a \\"round robin\\" story. Basically, they created this opening plot with a lot of potential, and then did not think about where it was going. They wrote it episode to episode. And as with a round robin story, you start it, tell it to someone, they pass it on etc. etc and add a chapter, and once you get to like the 30th telling, the story is complete and utter nonsense with no satisfying way to end it.<br /><br />That in my opinion is what happened with Lost. The writers just did not think it through. They counted their royalty checks, lapped up the fan support at the time, and went home thinking that they had created something profound. Instead we got this mishmash of crazy events that ultimately ended by being more frustrating than satisfying.<br /><br />In the midst of this we had six years of wonderful character development as each of these unique actors played off against each other. But I think most people will agree with me that the plot of the series was so convoluted that if you actually found yourself on the island in the midst of all this, it would be a living hell. How would you tell reality from insanity? Take Ben for instance. He started out as this totally manevolent character in the beginning, and at the end they've all pretty much forgiven him for the mass murders he caused (some he carried out personally like killing the entire Dharma Initiative staff), and become his friend... How's that happen?<br /><br />Another defining element of this series that is unique, aside from the round robin issue, is that I would estimate a good majority of die hard fans of the show will never buy it on DVD. What's the point? It has very little re-watch value. How can you watch season 1, knowing who's going to die when, who's going to kill who, and that all those events are pointless anyway? Charlie dies, sacrifices himself for nothing, and so does Jack, Juliet etc. etc. And think back. How many of the main characters didn't end up being murderers? Even Hurley ended up killing \\"Others\\" (he ran that guy down remember)...<br /><br />So how did the island redeem any of these people? How did it redeem Sayid? He probably killed more people on the island, and off of it for Ben, than he ever did in the Republican Guard.<br /><br />So I enjoyed the ride, but about half way through I realized that a madman was at the wheel and that the show was really going nowhere.<br /><br />One of the disappointing things for me in the end actually was in the lack of adequate extras on the DVD. They never seemed to interview any of the minor characters to see what they thought of their roles and of the series such as Christian Shepard, Mr. Eko, Shannon and Boone, Ana Lucia... All these excellent supporting characters were not only summarily dumped in the series itself, but dumped by the producers of the DVDs where they could have contributed commentaries of theirown.<br /><br />And it seemed to me also by leaving several characters out of the church at the end, Daniel Faraday, Charlotte and Richard Alpert for instance, they were telling us these people weren't good enough to be included with the rest of the cast.<br /><br />In terms of the interactions of the characters in the show, the character development, this series deserved four stars. In terms of the opening anticipation created by the plot and setting, also four, maybe five stars. But in terms of what the writers did to us by weaving this mess that inevitably went nowhere, one star if that. Are we allowed to give negative stars?<br /><br />This series is essentially a poster child for the confusion of our modern world, how everyone's religious, moral and scientific beliefs conflict. In the end, we hoped that the creators of the show would give us a meaningful answer to the mythology they themselves thought up. Instead, they just used us as a way to make a nice fat paycheck for a while, before we \\"Lost\\" interest in their bull.<br /><br />I think the conclusion to draw here is that the creators of this show were themselves \\"lost\\" from the beginning and probably still are. They are probably all still working in the industry trying to recreate the \\"magic\\" of this train wreck of a series.<br /><br />And that's sad, because actors like Evangeline Lily and Josh Holloway who gained notoriety from this series really are worth watching again in a series with a plot that has some connection to reality... If you have any hope of finding that in this series, \\"all hope abandon, ye who enter here.\\"
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The book starts well but it is very repetitive.  It could have very easily been just one book.  The characters were interesting the plot just wasn't.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Fills in a lot of gaps. Great plot twists. I feel like the author fills up a lot of pages on describing food or scenery that after reading hundreds of pages feels a bit tedious. Overall definitely recommend!
6304696558|4.0|This is a fun edition of the \\"Goldie\\" oldie. The DVD of \\"Private Benjamin\\" features the excellent quality of the original film. I did miss the original VHS jacket information,Delivery was prompt. I remember some scenes from the Denver premere that were not included in this edition and enjoyed the newer version for a better storyline. There is an amazing number of cameo,s to catch in the details. (PUNs intended).
B008D30K7E|3.0|Good fun if you're looking for light entertaining nonsense with a history lesson thrown in at various stages along the way.  The only part of your brain being stretched most of the time is your credulity, but don't let that stop you from reading it if it's good escapist fun you're after.
B008602KQI|4.0|the hunger games was really pretty good...............it was handled well and the bluray was well done............would have given it 5 stars but, just didn't think it was all and all fantastic.
B002W5UVSM|4.0|Very odd book but highly entertaining. Never have met or read a character like Ignatius. I would highly recommended this book, but only if you really like to read. This isn't your average book and therefor needs the reader to have an open mind. It is extremely funny though!
B002FQOI0A|5.0|My Grand-daughter (11) and I (68) read this book for a book club. This book club centered on younger and older generations and how we viewed a book of our choice. It was a well written book which held the readers interest and the mystery element encouraged both of us to not put the book down until we finished.<br /> I feel this book was probably the best we could have chosen to read/discuss together as it combined her interest in time travel and and mine in reality based fiction. We were able to discuss and understand more of each others thinking process and how it relates to our age experiences.<br />  I have to say that I came away from the discussion group with a more clear understanding of how the younger generation's literary interests relate to the changes in their world from that which I was exposed to. I found that I am almost myopic in my view of what I read and can grasp in literature yet she has a much more mind expansion that I now can understand, appreciate and envy. Her concept of time travel is my fortune telling/she can step outside her world as I am stuck with the muck of today/what I thought was trying to escape from the present is her being able to think on a higher level.  I really could go on and on about what I learned from our sharing of this book and, hopefully, she can too.<br />  Older generations be aware you might be confused at the end as it is not our norm way of thinking but expand on that (did it really happen? was Miranda caught up in the book she was so obsessed with? was it all part of growing up and being more aware of the world.) The last aspect is also a major part of the book and could also be the focus in a similar reading group.<br />  All in all-read it-enjoy and broaden your way of thinking (for us old people) and the youth of today will love it!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the final book in this trilogy.  It was everything I had hoped it would be.  I couldn't put it down (literally...I used my Kindle app on my phone and read it whenever I could!) and I really enjoyed the ending.  It was something I didn't expect and I like that in a book.
B000GCFY0I|3.0|This book was more than I expected. It was full of imagination that the author created and seemed real.  The characters also seemed real.It was an adventure that kept you interested and wanting more.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I Didn't want this series to end, but the ending was sweet and made me smile. I enjoyed the portion of the book from Christian's perspective. It made me realize all the details from the first book I had forgotten. I'm tempted to read the series all over again!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How this piece of trash makes it so popular, I'll never know.  I purchased the ebook out of curiosity.  What a joke.  It is NOTHING other than a porno flik on paper.  Racy novels are ok, at least there is a real story behind it - this is nothing but a tittilating, sick, perverse pile of random acts of depravity.  Have deleted it from my kindle lest it become soiled.  Don't even consider this unless you need the \\"stimulation\\"... NB had to make it one star so it could be posted.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Such a funny movie! My mother and I watched it together and were cracking up the entire time. It was a nice spin off of the classic 21 jump street and even one of the old characters made a halarious appearance in this film at the end! This movie is worth watching if you're a fan of comedy films such as the hangover, pineapple express, zoolander...etc.
B008602KQI|1.0|Couldn't wait to watch the movie, but realized that the quality of the DVD wasn't very good when it started freezing for short periods of time, and then froze for about five minutes at one point.  I put the DVD into another player and it did the same thing, so I realized it was not the player.  I had to take it somewhere and swap it for another copy, which turned out fine.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|Perfect for your vacation. Not too heavy. Not too long. Easy read. And very interesting diving into the mind of a young adult bent on some sort of mission of existence. Lots of willl be able to relate to the story as it touches a particular nerve that seems baked in each one of us. Some of whom have buried it deep with the trappings of modern life, TiVo, YouTube, SUV and a trip to Costco for that piece of steak. but to those still clinging to a small spark of curiosity and wonder that is, as Thoreau said, \\"a life not lived purposely, is not a life worth living\\".<br /><br />Read the book.<br />Take a trip.<br />Throw away the map.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|It put all of the players into a proper sequence.  It was great reading as all of his books are.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the most fun I have had in a very long time on a game of this type. you can have fun too! just try and see
B008ASLK8A|3.0|Sorry to say, this was not as good as the first Guy Ritchie production, although still worth watching, it lacked the quick wit and sharp dialogue as the first one, as well as the subject matter was a little more intense.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|its good app tells me wat my battery length is and how long i been using mu kindle  and the temperature
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Love this product.  First thing I check every morning; more accurate than the TV weatherman! Let's you know what to expect throughout the entire day.
B0012FHPXW|5.0|I have been a Nightwish fan for many, many years, and while I absolutely love the Tarja era and still follow Tarja's solo career, I really enjoyed this album. The songs are wonderful, and many of them are deep and fulfilling. I can listen to this album over and over and over again, and not grow tired of it. It makes me a happy fangirl.
B008602KQI|5.0|Where do I even begin with describing how incredible this movie is. It's not what I expected because you'd expect books that became movies to really suck but NO this movie was a perfect example of a great director and cast. Gary Ross did an amazing job with how he set up the storyline. Jennifer Lawrence is one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen and she portrayed Katniss Everdeen perfectly I couldnt imagine anyone else playing Katniss. Josh Hutcherson did an outstanding job as Peeta Mellark, the way he felt was always on his facial expressions and it was magic. He was just as charming and sweet and let's not even begin to mention his look(hot damn) as I had imagined in the books. Everything went just as how I reacted in the books. I highly reccomened this movie and if you think it's not good then go see a doctor cause you got stupid brain. Enjoy!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This is an exciting new writer. Her style is easy to read with great rewards. Surprising and shocking, however very educating to the girls amongst us that are \\"vanilla\\".<br />Once you have started you cannot stop even at 01h00 in the morning.  Buy all three books in the trilogy because once you have read fifty shades of grey you have to read book 2 and book 3.
B007SGM084|5.0|Nice novel. Got me and my friends hooked, and hoping for a Grey in our lives romantically, with a little of the erotic parts.
B00699SDR8|5.0|Despite the lingering existential ramifications of reading this novel, the imformation imparted is worth far more the thę price of the book
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A quick but fantastic read. Such a great story and reminder to always look for the silver linings in life. I've recommended this book to everyone I know that has asked about a good read.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app never fails to guess, it's almost spooky. Give it a try, it's worth the price and is a lot of fun, especially for a movie or TV buff. :)
B006MGDVFM|5.0|Even for someone who is not a big race fan this movie was very interesting and i left a Senna fan.
B002RVCD0U|5.0|It is what you would expect, but in a good way, for those who are interested in the action/drama genre
B006LSZECO|5.0|if you are looking for a well written, thought provoking mystery novel--this is it!  it may keep you guessing until the end--and then puzzled--wondering how little we know about perfect couples and the lives they hide.  the characters are complete people and it is one of the few mystery novels you could suggest for book club discussion.
0855329483|3.0|Purchased this book as a quick study in order to make a ring bearer's pillow for my baby sister's wedding. It had a ton of amazing flowers and the directions were relatively easy to follow. I am not a person who embroiders or does any hand sewing really at all. I loved the book, but hated how bad it smelled. I could smell it as I was opening the packaging. I wanted to leaf through the pages but the stench was so horrific it was making me sick to my stomach. I put it outside to air out for a few hours. Revisited it. It still smelled. Fanned through the pages outside and away from my body like it was one of those flip books kids would make in elementary school. When I needed to look through it, I did so outside and from a distance. I have owned the book for about a year now and it still smells and is kept in the garage. Content wise it's great though!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My 6 year old and I both enjoy this game. It challenges us both because it has so many levels. We can both play this game for extended periods of time. Its a great brain workout.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games movie was very true to the book, much more so than most movies. I thought it was very well done and am looking forward to seeing the movie sequel.
B004OCDLNS|2.0|Les Paul was understandably one of the best guitar players OF HIS TIME, but Jeff Beck is the best BEST guitar player of our time. He seemed to lower himself by playing this type of tunes!
B002MUAJ2A|3.0|Re-work contains a lot of \\"this worked for us, it will work for you\\" generalized advice that doesn't really apply to everyone, but is food for thought.<br /><br />It is well-written, bordering on conversational at times, and for a start-up company or the right niche, I think it's a great summary of a lot of strategies for getting more sometimes with less
B000I9WW0E|5.0|Jeff Bridges turns being a slacker into an art form in this very funny movie. John Goodman is equally good as the psychotic VN vet. If fact the whole cast is great.  The Coen Brothers strike again.  I've watched many times and will watch it again.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I was disappointed in this book.  Not all of the characters came to any type of closure.  He just seemed to forget about them.  Perhaps he had to many characters to keep track of. Bottom line - he could keep on making more books forever by adding in more characters and not finishing off each ones story.  Very disappointed.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This album is like vintage Queen only new and fresh. I know some people aren't fans of the auto tune. Whatever man. This is great stuff and I don't get tired of listening to it.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very thorough and well documented research.<br />I'm convinced about his findings and I'll remove wheat from my diet all together.
B008602KQI|4.0|I really liked the movie, thought that they did a good job, obviously the book is better, but still worth watching!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game to play and take your mind off life.  Easy to play and stimulate your brain at the same time.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|It was fun to see the old gang all come back together again.  I've been a fan since the first American Pie movie and this movie continued the same humor that was present in the original movies.<br /><br />Everyone maturing a bit was a twist to the movie that also made it enjoyable.<br /><br />I would have no problem recommending this move to anyone even if they haven't seen any of the other's in the series, but this movie would make more sense if you were already familiar with the characters.
B000IMM3XW|4.0|I loved how they rolled out the characters in typical x-men style. It answered a lot of questions for me (since I had seen some of the later ones and didn't understand all the dynamics) Typical balance of action with a hint of romantic interest. Good dialog for an action flick.
B007G92QGO|2.0|I was not impressed by this book; I did not find the characters or the plot engaging. The first half of the book was very slow with long and uninteresting explanations about the American legal system. From a psychological thriller point of view the premise is good but the characters were underdeveloped and uninteresting and the writing was clunky. Basically, I scanned about half of the text and if I had anything else to read at the time I would not have finished it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book did not meet the hype. It was poorly written so I could not get past the cheesy text.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|For those of you who, like me, enjoyed every minute of Matched, you should equally enjoy it's sequel Crossed.  The alternating POV's kept it fresh, while the story progressed in a perfect and believable way.<br /><br />Here's my link to my full review of Crossed : [...]
B003QS9VYE|3.0|If you haven't seen Dumbo at least once, you should. It's a touching Disney classic. I've seen it many times and though it's not my favorite, it has some really good scenes. Unfortunately the streaming quality wasn't the best when I rented it.
B003MC5N28|4.0|While it was a quick read, it offers many insightful and poignant concepts about life, and freedom and choice.  It's simple to read, yet has heavy and thought-provoking ideas.<br /><br />Check out my full, in-depth review: [...]
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this movie. The acting was excellent and it was true to the novel. My husband had not read the book and he really enjoyed the movie as well so you do not have to read the book to appreciate this movie.
B005P1TH2G|5.0|This is one of the easiest tools I have ever used. I used it to create some wire beads to embellish a necklace I was making, would highly recommend this product.
0525953728|1.0|Pentagon officials recently disclosed to the Associated Press (AP) that they could not find any photo or video evidence to confirm that Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed in the Navy Seal raid in Pakistan a year ago.<br />AP has submitted more than 20 requests for information surrounding the raid on Bin Laden's Abbottabad compound to the U.S. Government under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).<br />In response to the request for visual evidence of Bin Laden's death, the Pentagon stated that it could not find any pictures or video footage of the raid itself or of Bin Laden's dead body. It also told AP it could not locate any images of Bin Laden's body that were taken on the U.S.S. Carl Vinson, the Navy aircraft carrier that reportedly lowered him into the sea after his death.<br />In addition, the Pentagon admitted that it could not find an autopsy report, death certificate or results of a DNA identification test for Bin Laden, in spite of claims made by President Obama and reported by CBC News that a DNA test was performed.<br />These admissions follow a related FOIA response by the Department of Defense in February, in which it stated that it had no emails concerning the Bin Laden raid that were sent prior to its execution.<br />The Atlantic Wire reported in February that the CIA claimed it had visual proof of Bin Laden's death, but the Pentagon's admission that it does not have any evidence of this kind still raises significant questions, since its jurisdiction includes the Navy Seals that conducted the raid and the Navy ship that buried Bin Laden at sea.<br />The latest revelation drew the suspicion of Lt. Col. Robert Bowman (ret.), the former director of Advanced Space Programs Development for the U.S. Air Force. \\"It makes the official story sound very fishy,\\" Bowman said in an interview with Digital Journal. \\"Without proof, I'm not buying it carte blanche.\\"<br />Bowman also pointed to the reports that Bin Laden died in 2001 or 2002, which have been supported by former FBI counter-terrorism chief Dale Watson, former assistant Secretary of State Steve Pieczenik, former U.S. foreign intelligence officer Angelo Codevilla and other intelligence experts. \\"This smacks of a cover-up,\\" Bowman added.<br />Some organizations contend that the cover-up extends beyond the Bin Laden raid, including Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, a group of over 1,600 technical professionals that is calling for a new 9/11 investigation. \\"The raid is not the only part of the Bin Laden narrative that doesn't add up,\\" said founder Richard Gage, AIA. \\"It's also highly unlikely that Bin Laden and Al Qaeda had access to plant the explosives that brought down the Twin Towers and Building 7.\\"<br />Meanwhile, President Obama called for a time of remembrance and contemplation on the anniversary of the raid. \\"I think for us to use that time for some reflection, to give thanks to those who participated is entirely appropriate, and that's what's been taking place,\\" he said on Monday, according to McClatchy News. It remains to be seen how the public will reflect on the lack of credible evidence surrounding the demise of the world's most wanted terrorist.<br />By Elliott Freeman<br />Read more: [...]ter-terrorism chief Dale Watson, former assistant Secretary of State Steve Pieczenik, former U.S. foreign intelligence officer Angelo Codevilla and other intelligence experts. \\"This smacks of a cover-up,\\" Bowman added.

B008602KQI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot.  It had so much action and the way the director and characters embodied the text from the book.  The extreme looks and details of even the supporting cast was awesome.<br /><br />Love the movie.  Love the book.  Work very well together.
B004V45YBG|1.0|This was a boring tale that had no relevance. I rarely put a book down unfinished, but I could not bare to read (reread) another page.
B003KRGCTI|4.0|I really liked this movie. Some of the reviews say it was really religious but for the most part it isn't, at least to me. Overall, a good movie that has enough action to satisfy
B008ENNXQI|4.0|This movie was funny and entertaining!  As an adult I appreciated the lesson of this old fairy tale.  Lily Collins was excellent in this movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|When I found out one of my favorite books was being turned into a movie, I was ecstatic! While this movie isn't all it COULD have been, I can't say I am disappointed with this product. This is a movie my family and I will watch over and over again!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Excellent book, reads like a charming fairy tale. Everything is written or explained in such a way that your imagination is really well stimulated.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|The movie was just ok, the plot was a little stupid, it seems like they had a camera in every tree and even in the cave. they even had giant fireballs comming from who knows where.I guess its a movie for Kids, if your over 60 forget it.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie grips you until the end. My heart was racing through each adrenaline dripping scene. I can't wait for the sequel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you liked the first 2, you won't be disappointed. Frankly, I'm surprised that there is this much plot and storyline. Read the whole series in a week and weeks later, I'm still thinking about it. It's hot!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|waiting for energy is a pain but this is a good game to play during commercials and let energy build during your program
B007SGM084|5.0|i think this book was very well written and it keeps your interest not knowing what is going to happen with the couple in the story.
B0029LHW4U|2.0|Great album actually. Or great return to form of some sort. But this album is just like most modern music mastered past its due. DR5 you can get away with big beats and dance stuff I presume. Most classical and ambient today is mastered at DR12! Rock has no good reason to brickwall that waveform past the DR7 area at all imo, at least for the entire records. DR9 is much much more preferable to even this. And now you should start to see that DR5 is not going to cut it for really anything complex like Alice in Chains.<br /><br />This is what I don't understand: You don't want us to steal this music, yet you release the only digital and physical versions at such a loud and obnoxious and compressed volume that you can barely turn it up and the things is cracking and clipping. The people who master these albums like this need to be whipped. Or the people who demand they ruin music by brickwalling the sound like this must be strung up. This loudness war thing has just gone off the deep end. Systemic failure just like our culture here in America. This should have been a somewhat delicate, demanding, and aggressive record when need be, but it should have kept all its dynamics.<br /><br />And people wonder why this industry is dying. You alienate all the collectors who actually care about the music by giving them this stuff. Same thing with REM's recent albums and Nirvana's Nevermind remaster among many many others.<br /><br />4 star record at any rate. You will find some quality tunes on this one, as can be found and said better in reviews that focus on that aspect of the release.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The HD streaming version of The Hunger Games was a wonderful way for the whole family to enjoy this blockbuster without buying a physical DVD or Bluray disc that we may or may not ever watch again. Streaming over my home's wifi network through our PS3 worked beautifully except for one or two minor instances of pixelization due to buffering. The movie itself is enjoyable with a \\"Logan's Run\\" meets \\"Gladiator\\" type of plot. Will definitely rent movies through Amazon in the future.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|You have to read all three books to really enjoy this one.  If I read this one as a stand alone book the review would not have been as high.  The characters and the passion the reader begins to feel for them are the jewels in these books.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This is the \\"Harry Potter\\" for adults.  It's a great treat for the imagination.  The characters come alive and I came to care for all of them.  I look forward to reading other books by Erin Morgenstern?  Bravo!
B000Q76K1A|1.0|I love the growing excitement the book provides and the characters are amazing.  I look forward to the next movie each time!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Stephen King at his best!  Suspense and incredibly researched history.  I couldn't put it down.  He managed to make the history of a time I don't even remember come alive and resonate.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was very intriguing and I couldn't wait to keep reading! I want another one to come out, because I want to know how their life with the kids turns out!!
B008MZU8R0|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since 1974. Clockwork Angels is one of the best, right up there with 2112 and A Farewell to Kings.  My first time listening, I was really turned off by Geddy Lee's singing. Over the years he has went from standard Rock belt it out to actual singing.  Clockwork Angels, he is singing like a song bird. He holds notes, is very melodic.  so you have Rush at it's very best with the music, just beautiful, mixed timing, just a fest for my ears, but then Geddy is singing, took three times listening to the entire album for me to recognize, hey he is kind of good.  but the singing did distract from the instrumentation, these guys are masters, beyond masters, lets say artist.<br /><br />Oh well, what else can I say, just buy it, in twenty years they will still be playing this on the radio. Progressive Rock is like that.<br /><br />Favorite songs, The Garden and Headlong Flight, The Garden is just beautiful, lyrics are amazing, you may need to be in your 50's to appreciate it though.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|downloaded this game to help pass the time on road trips. Easy at first then they become quite a challenge.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Every one knew the ending of the first book was setting things up for a sequal but after you read Catching Fire you will be chomping at the bit to read Mockingjay! Catching Fire is as well written as Hunger Games and is full of suprise twists and turns in just about every chapter. I absolutely love Suzanne Collins as a writer. Her writting style makes for easy reading, with just the right amount humor to ease the tension. Especially when you realize you have have not been breathing for the last 5 pages! Her style also allows you to relate to almost all of the characters, including the ones you truely hope don't make it. Not many authors can do that.<br /><br />If your just ordering or starting to read Catching Fire, save time and order book three (Mockingjay) now. Trust me, when you get to the end of Catching Fire you will want to pick up Mockingjay as you put down Catching Fire!<br /><br />Way to go Suzanne! I'm one quarter of the way into Mockingjay and one part of me can't wait to get to the next chapter but another part of me realizes this is the last book and doesn't want it to end! I hate you! In a good way!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|It is a fun movie with an interesting plot line and twists. It is a shame the cover of the movie has the big white ape things because they only play a small part in the movie and are not too attractive.
B008602KQI|4.0|Loved the books and really liked the movie. It was not as accurate as the book, but there's no way they could have put all the detail in the movie.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Loved the book.  Its the same wry whit I've come to expect from Scalzi.  The additional codas were interesting as well.
B008XFB86Y|4.0|This movie is almost pure action from the start to finish with an interesting ending. If you are into martial arts action type movies you will love this one!!!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|A friend gave me this book to read, and then I purchased the DVD and have given copies to two friends. For me, it is a very inspirational set of messages and even though I have just begun \\"practicing\\" the ideas within, my life and view of life's happenings have taken on a magical quality! One needs to be in the \\"right place and mind\\" to hear the messages contained within - but, IMHO, if the majority of people on this planet took these ideas to heart, our world would be very, very different. Well worth the purchase price!
B0080GUX2Q|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. As a pessimist, I always thought that most of my ideas about life were not shared with mankind. The book showed me that some of my personal strategies are in fact quite common and proved effective also by others.<br /><br />If you hate self-help books I am sure that you will love reading this book, if you love them you SHOULD read this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book was an excellent read. The plot was both original and exciting. The characters were believable. I enjoyed the plot twist right in the middle of the book and the way it turned from Amy's diary entries to her current experiences.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My only regret is not getting it sooner! Very helpful when balancing a budget or checkbook and even for kids to use for homework. The size if the calculator on the kindle fire is easy to see...no more squinting! THANK YOU!
B005WTR4ZI|3.0|This book along with LIGHTS IN THE TUNNEL should be read by every person training to enter the job market. If you thought the industrial revolution was a revolution, you haven't seen anything yet.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|i expected more from all the hype. failed some logic tests. slow pace, it took forever to get going. not waiting for movie 2
B008602KQI|4.0|I'm sure a lot has been said about it. I read the trilogy before going to see the movie for the first time. It's cotton candy for the mind like any other action movie and all of the violence from the books could obviously not be shown.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|I was already a big fan of Daniel Suarez, having devoured both Daemon and Freedom TM in marathon sessions. I recently watched Leo Laporte's interview of Daniel Suarez on Triangulation, and immediately ordered the book Kill Decision on my Kindle. I was not disappointed. Suarez's newest novel could be next week's headlines. The use of drones, and the possible misuse of drones is now.<br />Thanks, Mr Suarez, for a dynamite read.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I was really impressed with The Hunger Games.  I'm probably the last person on earth to read it, but I thought the writing was great, the concept was original, and I loved the humanity and emotion of the characters.  Book 2 -- Cathing Fire -- Not so much.  The saga continued, but with less finesse.  It almost read like a treatment for a screenplay.  Maybe that's what it was, but it was much more political, less personal.  I am now reading the third book of the trilogy and I'm happy that it resonates more like the first book than the second.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book lived up to its' name and its' expectations.  I loved it.....and have already begun book 3 of the trilogy.  I HOPE that there is a happy ending, but the title of book 3 leads one to believe that there is not.  Which is more like real life anyway.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|Doesn't work! Try as I might, I can't get it to display any maps. Deleted it from my Kindle. It's worthless to me - a waste of time.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|This movie is, in a word, a work of art. Silent, in black-and-white, and utterly charming. It is no wonder that it received the awards that it did, all well deserved.
B0084IHVC0|4.0|The first Disney animated feature produced after Walt Disney's passing was 1970's The Aristocats. While it has never been held in the same esteem as Snow White, Fantasia, or even latter-day classics like Beauty and the Beast, it's a thoroughly entertaining romp that places characters and set pieces over a very basic plot reminiscent of 101 Dalmatians and Lady and the Tramp.<br /><br />It's also a bit puzzling because it combines disparate voice acting performances from, among others, Hungarian Eva Gabor as a French cat, Pat Buttram and George Lindsey as country cornpone dawgs in rural France and even an elegant performance by Hermione Baddeley as Madame Bonfamille -- a change of pace from her more familiar blustering Mary Poppins/Happiest Millionaire domestics or the bawdy Mrs. Naugatuck on TV's Maude.<br /><br />What's loveliest about The Aristocats as a film, especially in the crisp light of Blu-ray on this new edition, is the masterful animation, captured in its spontaneous glory through the Xerox process, a method of copying pencil art directly onto animation cels in place of inking each line again.<br /><br />As kids, we called this the \\"scritchy lines\\" type of animation -- not as clean and polished and at the time, not as preferable. But seeing it today in an age where even TV animation has a slickness and therefore a distancing perfection, this kind of animation is now precious and rare. On Blu-ray, you can really appreciate the lines as they vibrate in every motion. Not a nuance is lost.<br /><br />Another fine aspect of The Aristocats is its score. Though not a musical in general, there are several fine songs by Terry Gilkyson, Floyd Huddleston, Al Rinker and especially the Sherman Brothers, who apparently created several songs left unused in the film. Richard Sherman is very much a presence on the bonus features (carried over from the previous DVD release and now primarily on the Blu-ray disc). Richard narrates an entire opening sequence that is very different from the one we know.<br /><br />But from a Mouse Tracks perspective, the most fantastic thing about the bonus features is that they include mention of our beloved Robie Lester, who provided Eva Gabor's singing vocals for Duchess the cat. The appearance of these material on the DVD was the very first time her significant contribution was acknowledged and it's nice to know it's also here on the Blu-ray.rent from the one we know.<br /><br />But from a Mouse Tracks perspective, the most fantastic thing about the bonus features is that they include mention of our beloved Robie Lester, who provided Eva Gabor's singing vocals for Duchess the cat.

B0016JBCJW|5.0|It amuses and comforts me. Even after repeated viewings, I am still moved by \\"The Darjeeling Limited.\\" I highly recommend it, especially if you've enjoyed other Wes Anderson movies, such as \\"Moonrise Kingdom.\\"
B0023SDPS6|4.0|The largest city with no police force. I like to think of it that way, but then the stories wouldn't be as much fun. Always a good read. Sure gets injured a lot, should carry his own med kit.
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|While the film is unique and original, it's enjoyable mostly for those qualities alone.  The story itself isn't the most compelling.  The actors give fantastic performances as well.
B008133MDK|5.0|This show is the best possible update of the Sherlock Holmes stories I can imagine.  Updating all Conan Doyle's Victorian tropes to the contemporary 21st century period, the dialogue is clever and each episode is visually stunning--like a full-length movie.  This series is amazing!
B000PEX1IE|5.0|Great classic comedy.  We rented the movie to watch with our tween daughter and she really enjoyed it.  It's difficult to find movies the whole family likes but this is one we do all like.  We did a download rental and it worked great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wish I had purchased this book sooner- it was a joy to read. The universe of the Silo is gritty, believable, and captivating, and you will find yourself unable to put your kindle down when reading it. One of my favorite books of the year.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Deborah Harkness does a fantastic job establishing characters that aren't just interesting, but that you really care about.  I could hardly put it down and purchased \\"Shadow of Night\\" as soon as I had finished \\"A Discovery of Witches.\\"  I can't wait for the concluding book in the trilogy!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It was bad. Really bad. I was bored by the never ending unrealistic sex.  The writing was abysmal. If I had to read one more time about her biting her lip or clambering onto something, I would cry. So I stopped reading 3/4 of the way through. I just didn't care.
B00005JO9J|1.0|Wow! I didn't know they hire teenagers to write TV shows with adult characters, but I guess there's a place for puerile drama for adults. Not so sure what the excuse is for the atrocious acting by so many actors (especially patients and their families - holy cow! Surely they must be relatives of cast members, writers, or production personnel, only excuse I can think of), but I guess budget trumps all in this one. Still, I admit, I find this series entertaining to watch in the same way I'm drawn to watch \\"fail\\" videos on YouTube - like watching a train wreck in slow motion over and over. I sure do have respect for the lead actors who managed to keep straight faces while reading scripts and reading their lines, and can't blame them for going for the steady paycheck.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a selection of my book club and I was not terribly excited.  It was a terrific story with memorable characters, well-written, suspenseful, emotional and delightful.  Many of the main characters were not able to process or communicate deep hurts and emotions directly but learned to compensate with other forms of communication (eg, flowers).  Good read!  Everyone in our book club ended up liking the book very much and it led to some interesting and heated discussion on ancillary topics such as foster care, brain wiring and redemption.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|One of the best actions movies I've ever seen.  Fantastic fight scenes, decent plot, more fantastic fight scenes.  Must see for people who want something fresh in an action movie.
B008602KQI|4.0|This video focuses on the highlights from the book and with minor exceptions does a good job. The only disappointment I had was the costume design for the citizens of the Capital, they just didn't meet the extravagance of the book. All and all a welcome addition to anyone's video collection.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. Useful in so many ways to keep me closer to God. Follow along at church or anywhere at anytime. Take notes easily. A wide variety of reading plans too.
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|This book answered so many of the lingering questions that I had on how to get a competent, professional mix. It was very comprehensive and informative, with many references to valuable tools. It also expressed a great sense of humor, which helped me to get through some of the more technically challenging parts.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|The Outlander series is very imaginative, with just the right amount of historical background and fact.  The author captivates you with her characters, making you eager for the next book.
0345803485|3.0|I found this book rather quirky,amusing and pure fantasy. The erotic episodes were just that, erotic. Christian loved him: handsome, complex and stupid rich. However, Ana should have been older, and maybe she would not had issues about his issues, and wanting a more traditional relationship. An older woman would have thoroughly enjoyed the sex and his level of intimacy for what it was....and the material trinkets as well without guilt. I enjoyed the many avenues of communication they shared; made communicating very creative. Ana got on my nerves asking so many questions about a past, (I guess there would not be a story if she did not ask)and saying jeez, and oh my! Its erotica and mindless reading and if you are in the mood for that, read the book.
B0081L37Z0|3.0|This film had pretty good reviews so I was expecting to like it more than I did. There are definitely some funny moments, but it's pretty uneven and overall is just OK.
B004XVN1T4|3.0|Fairly Enjoyable; however, the plot was slow and predictable in places. It is not what I expect from Mr. Follett who I rank near the top--in the company of my favorites: Grisham, Baldacci, and W.E.B Griffin. Still I enjoyed it and glad to have gotten it on my Kindle (at a Kindle price, of course).
B0088TG252|5.0|if you like action pack movie then<br />you would love this movie. it's full of action of beginning to end. good story with great actors. a must...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was written so it could have sequels -- that is never a good thing.  One was plenty for me.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Good movie (haven't read the books) and interesting concept.<br /><br />There is a problem with the digital online movie and hopefully it has been repaired by now.  But about half way through the movie, the feed freezes completely.  Stopping the movie several times and fast forwarding to the same point and it happened each time.  Finally, we just had to fast forward past the offending spot and the movie ran just fine from there to the end.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I have read all of the latest military/spy/suspense/thrillers that have been published in the last 20 years that I can get my hands on. I must say this book ranks up there with the best of them... AND IT'S FACT NOT FICTION!
B008602KQI|5.0|I bought this because my daughter read the books and wanted to see the movie.  To my surprise I found it to be an excellent movie.  It held our interest and now I am reading the books!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read this type of story, but I have to say WOW.<br />If a book doesn't grab me from the beginning, I don't bother<br />finishing it. But this book, I just could not put it down.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Felt her experience with heroine was often referenced  but treated with 'just one thing I experienced' attitude rather than long term affect it has.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Good book club novel.  I loved the characters and the story line.  Not your run of the mill novel.  Highly recommend.
B003PM5Y4M|5.0|Actors, writers, producers, agents...all take a beating on this Vietman War action film spoof. Highlights are Robert Downey Jr's performance mocking one of Australia's famous over-actors and Jack Black's over the top junkie.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr received an Oscar nomination for his role...something you wouldn't expect out of a Ben Stiller film. He deserved to win but didn't.<br /><br />Take a chance, you'll be entertained.
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|Awesome I love the walking dead I still have the last two episodes of S2 to watch.<br />I can't wait for season 3.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|It is the best math app or program out there.<br />I have the full verson also but I use the app mostly.<br />You can not go wrong with app and it is less than $4.
B000FGFUMM|5.0|Question:  I see this OMR version was released in 2006.  I'd like to know if it is a remastered version of the ORIGINAL release, but with the bonus tracks, or is it a remastered version of the 2004 release that was both remastered and REMIXED.<br /><br />In other words, is this the original or the remixed one?<br /><br />Many thanks!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Movie done well with what they did. Left too much out from books. Viewer had to try and figure out too much of story. Such as what was the reason for hunger games and why? Typical movies done today, trying to cram too much into too little.
B005MMYCY6|5.0|I love this movie, it's so many things at once. It's hilarious, dramatic, heart stopping, and exciting. All the actors/actresses worked together so well and really did make an amazing movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt nailed the part of Hesher, playing a seriously amazing part. When they filmed this movie, they did do a really good job at catching TJ's confusion, anger and sadness. I absolutely LOVE this movie and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00846TRHY|4.0|I liked  how they portrayed a realistic view of a man before he knew Christ and after. there is quite a bit of swearing but, if you think about who he was, that would be accurate.
B000IZ1HP4|1.0|This movie was so disappointing to me that I did not watch it through to the end. I wish you had the movie back and I had my money back !!!
B006RXQ3T6|5.0|This is a classic that still stands the test of time.  Was able to show this to my 14 year olds and they loved very minute of it.
B006Y9BULE|4.0|I have had it less than a month and it now won't hold a charge overnight.  Other than that, I would like it a lot, but this one is going back.<br />UPDATE:  As usual, Amazon accepted my return with no problem.  I reordered the same watch.  The new one seems to be working just fine.<br />Follow up:  I've had the second watch for a year now.  It's still working fine and gets lot's of positive comments.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I thought this was a fun and interesting show.  The \\"science\\" behind it is of course questionable, but it is an entertaining show with a great cast of characters.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|This book made me cry and laugh like never before! As soon as I finished it, I felt an immense sense of disappointment because I wanted it to go on forever.
B004VFYNRQ|5.0|This 3 CD compilation of Howlin' Wolf for under $ 10- is a total bargain & maybe one of the best places to start collecting the greatest Blues singer that ever lived.<br />The recordings are very clean, clear & present to my ears- especially compared to the 2 CD Definitive Collection Anthology -the Blues from Hell recording is a more enjoyable experience !<br />& i LOVE the cover photo 'n' title much more as well !!!<br />& so, i wanted to put up a review for this collection to recommend it to any one lookin' for the best place to start & can't afford the Chess Box as<br />this 3 CD collection is a whole 'lotta 'Wolf for under $ 10- !!!!!
B000M0QMM8|1.0|This was a children's movie.  I am an adult. It was a waste of my time and money since there are no children in my family.
B004M20YDU|4.0|I suppose if you're a heavy dance/electronica fan, this set might have different implications for your music library; however, for someone with a more eclectic music collection, this set will fit right in with everything else you own. The reason I say that is because the mix of musicians here provides a bit of everything. I'm happily reminded of my days in college some (gulp!) 25 years ago. So, while the music is very modern and up-to-date, it doesn't lose the integrity of days gone by. While The Crystal Method was instantly recognizable to me, the music was not as pedestrian as you might think, but that's just my opinion. Heck, some of the orchestral arrangements reminded me of The Alan Parsons Project back in the 70's - you know, stuff I grew up with. I do agree with most reviewers that Track 2 was just annoying, but then again, I may grow to enjoy it after listening to it for awhile. Track 4 actually annoyed me too, but again, after listening for a time, it may grow on me.
B008602KQI|5.0|I would give it six stars if more then five had been available. I read the books first. The movie was better then I thought possible, in the time lotted for length of movies. From the book I had some different visions in mind, but I am sure you had different ones then I did. But I believe the movie was true to the book, and I have already watched it four times and it is right up there with my favorites of HARRY POTTER and LORD OF THE RINGS. Hats off to writer Suzanne Collins and the movie director Gary Ross, these books and this movie (awaiting the future movie releases) have and will find many re-visits from me.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Tried it out on iPhone 4s,  Iphone 4, Ipad, Ipad2 and in every case although it would connect to the baby monitor, the app would not get past creating a profile for my child.  I went to customer support and there is no telephone number. See for yourself.  [...]contact I challenge you to find a number to call.  It was a big waste of time.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|It was a very interesting start, I enjoyed the story but the drawback for me were the pictures, it took away from the story because I have seen fake pictures like that .I had a slight problem with reading the letter as it appeared on my Kindle, it was hard see the writing even with a larger font.
B008602KQI|5.0|I bought The Hunger Games online for the lower pre-order price, and I got exactly that. I am so pleased with my purchase!
B0055PMJMW|4.0|These stories are nice interim reads before I dive back into a more thorough novel. Good, short stories -- these are not deep, well defined and detailed novels. Enjoy them for what they are.
159413586X|4.0|These 3 books were extremely disturbing I thought, but I wanted to read them....<br />At the end it said \\"written for young adults\\"..........I was stunned to read that......<br />I would not want my child reading these books......am I missing something here?<br />Did I take them too seriously?<br />I wish someone would clarify this for me?????<br />treesa
B008602KQI|4.0|I saw this movie before I read the book.  Loved the story.  Since then I have read the three books, and I can't wait until the other movies are released.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|I have been a Michael Connelly fan for years and \\"The Last Coyote\\" was right up there with his other<br />\\"Harry Bosch\\" books. Kept me wanting to get back to the story every time I put it down for a while.<br />Keep at it Mr. Connelly.
B0041D843M|3.0|Doctor Campbell, a world renowned PHD and now a vegetarian as a result of his studies of cancer, has made certain assumptions that don't delve into what ELSE was removed from the diets of the subjects, such as sugar and other fructose-containing foods. I'm not a vegetarian and never will be, but the overall message of the very well-written book, I believe, is misleading.<br /><br />Man was never and is not intended to be vegetarian. We're omnivores and a diet of both meat, fish and vegetables, without the processed foods, sugars and grains will maintain our health by reducing the cellular inflammation and keeping our immune systems ready to fight the real bad guys, not the junk we're putting inside ourselves as food.<br /><br />This book is well worth reading, just don't \\"take it to the bank\\".
B001DWXUWY|4.0|Good album, had purchased it because I like the song 'The '59 Sound', but found the whole album to be a good listen with plenty of other great tracks.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|the game is good but the timing between the sound and the pressing of the button is really bad. and its like a 2 sec pause between the 2. i hav to turn off the volume to make it seem like its on time but it just makes the game worse.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|this game requires SO MUCH MEMORY and just downloading the game without the downloaded you have to get before you get the game which is 819 megabytes slows down my mingle fire soooooooo much! gameloft is terrible!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I purchased this book for late night reading and it is as good as the rest. The Gate House is by far the best in my opinion, but Plum Island is very well written too. I have read about 75% and you can tell it is already starting to take shape, but like the rest of these books, it might be getting ready to take an unexpected turn. I would recommend this book if you are a Nelson DeMille fan as I am. For a late night read it's pretty hard to put down. I'm looking forward to finishing it, so I can start another one of his great stories. Enjoy.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is very addictive and hard to put down, my mother got me addicted to this game. Thanks Mom!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is awesome because you get to unlock cool games and you get points for each game you play and the more points you get the more games you unlock.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Before our family travels anywhere, I check TripAdvisor first.  So far they have not steered us wrong.  I also like to leave reviews, in hopes it will help someone else out too.  I have recommended it to lots of friends and family too.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is one of my favorote apps that I have, better than facebook in my opinion!!! it has A LOT of diy. projects that are really fun and easy
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is excellent!!! I love lOve love this film, it is cast perfectly, peeta maybe could've been different but in all it is a great movie, loved the books and I can't wait for the second film
B008476HBM|5.0|Watched the pbs version of the book then watched the new version of the movie, so I figured I better read the book.  The book keeps you entertained as you picture each chapter in your head.  Normally when I watch a movie before a book I get disappointed when I get around to reading it, but in this case the book gives a lot of depth to the characters, which makes it one of the few books turned into movies where I would recommend watching the movie first.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. My two boys really like playing it and have it downloaded on all their mobile devices.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This was my first Dan Brown novel and I couldn't put it down! So excited to start another one soon.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|As always Philippa Gregory does a wonderful job of telling a good story while giving us an excellent overview of history.  You can always count on a good read and an excellent education as well.
B001QVFDA4|4.0|Great movie, well written and well executed, loved the humor, it was witty and smooth. Action and adventure with all twists and ties coming together
B0058W74UY|5.0|Love this program..it's awesome! You must download and try it. I is so easy to use..make playing things so much faster and easier<br /> Download the program and try it for yourself.
B002IE2JF0|4.0|This seemed like a risk to rent. It was not. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />The movie is very good once you get past the fact that these ancient Nords accept a stranger into their camp with super short hair, modern clothing and no facial hair. LOL But one does have to suspend some belief when watching a fantasy film.  That said, I found the movie very entertaining and will watch it again.  I would have enjoyed seeing this film in a theater.<br /><br />Story, characters, pacing and special effects were all excellent. Go on, rent it. It's worth a rent.
B0038QN2AS|4.0|I read this after seeing Leo Laporte rave about it on Twit.tv.  I found the book somewhat frustrating that the \\"good guys\\" never seemed to catch a break and the \\"evil\\" Daemon and it's minions seemed to be winning at every turn of the page.  The book was enjoyable all the same, but I felt a bit let down at the ending at first.  Then I watched an interview with Daniel Suarez and realised that he actually wrote Daemon and Freedom TM at the same time as one book, but it was too long for his first novel so split them up.  So I read the first few chapters of Freedom TM for free on his website and I was instantly hooked and decided to buy that and read it too.  Together these books are fantastic, but I will review Freedom TM separately... all I can say is that it was worth reading this book to get the background and lead into the next.  Not that I felt tricked into paying twice for one big book (So cheap on Kindle anyway), Daemon on it's own is an enjoyable and exciting read, but you get so much more out of it if you follow it up with the next one which is a much more intelligent and thought provoking book in my opinion.<br /><br />Now if only his latest one was book was available on the Kindle here in Australia... stupid publishing companies blocking downloads in different regions!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Trilogy was great has me wanting more..can't get enough of Mr Grey....I'm so in love with that man....pls pls give us more?
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|This was the perfect choice to read to our grandson, who lives 6 thousand miles away.  It was our children's favorite book and now Wes listens to his Opa read him the story, about 8 times a day!  Steve not only read the book, with FEELING, but added little extra sayings to Wes, ie, \\"Wes, see if you can find the mouse on this page?\\" and \\"Wes, are you sleeping now?\\" and \\"Remember that Opa loves you\\". It really was a personal gift. AND, the story was THE STORY, not abridged or changed, making many pages of joy.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is a great series. I like that it is not sugar coated. So many novels now are people exspect the good guy to always win. If a character in these books is happy in any way the writer almost always shuts that down. One minute you are engaged and in love the next your boyfriend is chopping your dad's head off.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love all three books! Best series I've ever read. Such a fast and easy read, you'll be disappointed when it's all over because you never want it to end. Or you can just do what I did and restart the series over again :)
B008602KQI|5.0|I appreciate receiving the product on time and for actually saving on the deal!  Thanks so much for the excellent service!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Every time I move to a new device I have to bring my birds with me. The only drawback is that when you reach top scoring on all levels where do you go? There should be some incentive.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love all these books. I know some didn't care for the slower pace but it's just a continuation of the story. I think it's fabulous!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The story line was average, but the details of their sex escapades was a little much, dont you think?  I also found it very repetitious as times.  Would not recommend it to anyone.
B00846REIS|1.0|I read this book since it was recommended if I liked 50 shades of Grey which I loved. This author put no thought into the book. She literally copied most of the story-line with just added a background of sex abuse instead of physical abuse and she used dirtier words like c***which made it less tasteful. It was torture just finishing the book.
B008602KQI|3.0|I've read all three books and are obsessed with them. Once I watched the first film I was disappointed. I didn't feel as emotionally attached to the characters as I was when I read the books. They changed how characters die, and don't really show Katniss' struggle in the games. They make surviving the games look easy compared to the book. Also they dont show how Katniss and Peeta's love blossoms through out the games as It fid in the books. Overall the movie was decent, the actors were amazing, but if you love the books as much as I do I'm sure you'll find the movie to be a let down like I did.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Bob is a distinctive talent who's work stands the test of time. This album has all his best music. I usually pick and choose song from different singers, but with this collection, I wanted the entire CD and I'm happy with it.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|I was aware of Patti Smith when I started this book but I am a fan now because of this book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The app works great it does exactly what it says. Its good to know where my battery life goes. If your looking for an app to track how your battery is used you found one that works great.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Sucks you in immediately and never slows down. I would recommend this to anyone, but especially pop culture and video game nerds like me
B007IXWKUK|5.0|II loved this book. It was my favorite or the 3. I liked that you got more information about Christian and his early childhood.
B00846TTDG|5.0|The movie has action from the start and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The actors were great also.
B005USZML4|5.0|Grisham has always been an excellent read.<br /><br />I purchased the Theodore Boone novel not realizing it was geared towards younger readers.<br /><br />I'm 47 years old and a professional in the communications industry.  I found the novel refreshing and interesting.<br /><br />Grisham always grabs your attention right away.  Once I finished the first novel, I downloaded the next and finally the third novel. I believe I finished them all in a little over a week and look forward to more of young Theo's adventures.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this series regardless of your age. You\ll enjoy them.<br /><br />Dan R.
B0030M3SBI|5.0|this is perfect through and through and live recording at that! my favorite track is power to love...makes me wonder how hendrix might have moved into deeper funk and soul had he survived himself.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my kids love it! so to I. so many choices and it never gets old! even my husband liked to try to get the best score on every game. try the games and I bet you'll love it too!
B008VBYN80|5.0|very fun, addictive and passes the time nicely.  beautiful graphics. i dont like that you have to sign in to facebook or create
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and cannot wait to begin reading the third installment.  I couldn't put the book down.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I really like the app but I hate the permissions!<br />this app is good but I really wish I could get that read clearly app on Amazon... all well
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I've played the iPad version of this game for a few months so I knew I was getting a fun game.  This Android version has suddenly quit on me a couple times but other than that it's pretty similar to the iOS version.  Simple concept but addicting!
B008602KQI|5.0|I devoured the books in The Hunger Games trilogy and anxiously awaited the movie release.<br />Upon seeing it, although the cast was perfect (yeah, yeah, the literary Katniss looks nothing like Jennifer Lawrence, but Jennifer IS Katniss), I was kind of disappointed. I thought key plot points were missing, and what was up with those holographic hounds taking the place of the scary-as-all-hell genetically engineered dead tributes/hounds??? That said, I knew I was going to purchase the DVD. I preordered the movie in Blu-ray, and I viewed it 2 days after receiving it. It is a revelation. The colors are sharp and clear and vibrant, the wonderful soundtrack soared through the speakers, the action was well-defined and exciting. I was sucked in like I hadn't been in the theater, and like the books, did not want it to end. This is why they make DVD's in Blu-ray format, and this makes a classic addition to my movie library. And I haven't gotten to the extras yet!
B005VA8AJW|5.0|I absolutely loved this show!  I watched the entire 1st season in about 2 days!  I cannot wait for next season!  The writing is awesome, the cinematography is awesome, the acting is stellar!  Dylan McDermott, and Jessica Lange are fabulous!  I am hooked!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book wrapped up and i wish it wasn't done yet! What a great story, for any age - teen or adult. Kind of relates to a world or country that has been run by a few for the good of a few - sound familiar?<br />Fantasy, yes, but a great thread runs though it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is very relaxing. And if you are only wanting to pass the time &amp; get thru the levels, it's easy. I love how you can also challenge yourself by either surpassing your own personal best score or by attempting a &quot;perfect score&quot;. It's up to you how challenging you want to make it.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is a Fun Game !! You don't need to be an artist. Reminds me of Pictionary. Requires a little bit of patience occasionally.  Enjoy !
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|calculator works just for what I need. it doesn't turn off or to unexpected things. just a normal calculator. good luck.
B000FC10MU|5.0|Read this book after a friend recommendation. Very good choice since I like realistic/fantastic books and that the plot is starting really early. Easy to read, new concept, I would recommend it to mostly everyone looking for something new to read
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I wish the agenda widget would scroll.  Other than that, this is the best calendar app I have tried. Very configurable.  I was able to increase the agenda font size to make it easier to read.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game is really fun to play. It has pretty good graphics. My kids absolutely love playing this game .
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Part II keeps you guessing.  What will Christian do now?  What will Ana do?  It's anyone's guess.  Always looking forward to what will happen next. Stay tuned.........
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play - my grandkids play - fun family game - very creative - although I do not know how to draw many of the clues - I am learning!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed this book much better than the first one.. kept my interest the whole time.<br />  It did not drag out like the first one ..currently reading the last one now
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I kept on looking for the punch line and it never came. The ending after the failed attempt on the presidents life was especially boring.There were just too many plots and too many sub-plots. This book was not one of King's best.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I just didn\\"t get \\"into\\" the story.  I guess maybe it may have been me but I didn't enjoy reading it that much. Other reading I have done in the past really \\"grabs\\" me from the start, this did not.Far too much fuss made over the book.<br />In my opinion I would never see it as a Number 1 best seller.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and very addictive.  it just keeps going and going and going and going and going and going and going. I would recommend it to everyone.
B005LAIH4A|1.0|I thought this movie would be on the level of Despicable Me and Puss in Boots.  I was wrong!  This movie is not funny; not endearing; not worth the price being charged for it.  I should have known as I had never read the book, and we are huge Dr. Seuss fans.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing! Best book of the three in the series. Very suspenseful and climatic. You cannot stop reading it, because it is so addictive.
B008FC4WA4|3.0|Short fast-reading story, but not as witty as Nick Hornby can do or has done. Nothing too special, but still easy to read and entertaining
B008602KQI|2.0|This movie is a dystopian view of our world in which teenagers are served up as a kind of \\"Roman Coliseum\\" story in which they fight to the death for their individual districts with the game being rigged to boot.  This movie is not entertaining, not pleasant, and basically a waste of two hours as far as I was concerned.  If you are a teenager you may like it because it involves youth getting thrown to the wolves but as an adult, I just did not get it. If you must watch this, get it on demand through your cable provider and watch it once.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|It's nice to not leave your living room to watch a HD movie. Plus you can watch it more than once. It's sad so many of the cast has passed away,it would have been nice to have just one more.
B001H1UQZU|3.0|I like the acting and the story the acting you could see the actors were still learning their craft the fact it was a true story gave it more meaning to me
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I bought a second copy of this movie after we \\"wore out\\" the first.  This movie is lovely on all levels!  It is funny, heartwarming, and clever to boot!
B007SGM084|5.0|from the time I started I could not put the book down!!!!!!  I highly recommend it to anyone with a vivid imagination!!!
B005J4ASDG|5.0|This is probably the best collection of music from the Lord of the Rings available right now, as I think the performances sound better than what's on the actual soundtracks.  The only drawback to this is the length of each movement, which means either you'll have to set aside a large chunk of time if you want to listen to this album, or you can remember when certain segments start, for example \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" starts at about 4 minutes 40 seconds on the first movement.  Long car trips are also a good place to try to listen to all of this, or at least a few movements.<br /><br />Anyways for the price it's a great buy, whether you're doing the download or cd, in which case the cd is a bit more expensive, but still worth it.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|The best read ever ever<br /><br />I have learnt about relationships<br />I have leant about how to pease your husband<br />I have learnt how to please oneself
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app works great! Haven't had any problems with it and you can even delete old emails. This comes in handy when I don't have my computer around or if I just need to check it really quick
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down!  Great book, keeps surpising you page after page! I would recommend this book!
B007SGM084|3.0|much to much vivid sex scenes.  If you can skip most of them, the story is O.K. but the sexual content took over the whole theme.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games is true to the story and does not resort to more violence than necessary so that ages 8 and up can enjoy the movie.
B001KQEE0U|5.0|If your into hiphop, rap or music at all you already know who 2pac is..the best rapper of our time and this is probably the best he ever put together, with so many classics it could dam near be a greatest hits album.. Bottom line, if you don't have it already..get it ! You won't be hearin music like this on your radio anytime soon..
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it. I really enjoy snatching others great ideas and passing it for my own. only issue I have is occasionaly the app freezes and I have to sign out then back in. Occupies me while out on maternity bed rest.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|A down to earth cop with real people problems. Excellent reading. Will be looking for more to be coming out.
B004LX0D36|5.0|Like sitting down and catching up with an old friend.  Love this author.  If you haven't read her -- make a leisurely friend.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|GREAT READ. I could not put any of the series down until I was finished. My boss would not be happy to know.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|What can one say about the Evernote UI? It's simply fantastic!<br /><br />They are always improving it and adding more features that are great and still somehow making it easier to use everytime!<br /><br />As a developer specializing in making difficult tasks eas(ier) to accomplish, they are the best and most consistant I've ever seen.<br /><br />Well done Evernote.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl is not only a great writer, but a person I would love to hang out with someday. I have shared some of her experiences in life and I loved the way she translated it to paper. She touched on every emotion dealing with the grieving process. I loved her adventures on the PCT and the people she met. I loved this book!
B008A31UO4|5.0|For someone like me who hadn't any experience with programming, but a deep desire to a) understand how it works conceptually and b) learn to do some basic programs to analyze data, this book has been a real delight. It takes you through each step without making any assumptions about your knowledge, but at the end of each chapter I had always learned a hell lot. Almost all notions that I learned I could apply directly afterwards on simple problems. Also, each chapter builds on the previous one, so reading them in order was a great way to gain understanding of R. Of course, you can also check up more specific issues you might be interested in (matrix multiplication, say). Finally, even though this book is about R, it has enabled me to understand more general concepts in programming which work similarly in other languages, e.g. Python.<br />Great book for self-study!
B005MLP71Y|3.0|This movie was cute but not unforgettable. It was a nice flick to sit down and watch with the kids. No worries about inappropriate content.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|The writers for the show never seize to amaze. I love the complexities of the characters; the final scene was insane. I can't wait for the next season.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After the seemingly triumphant finale to \\"The Hunger Games,\\" I questioned how Suzanne Collins could possibly write more books within the same series. After all, hadn't Katniss won the Hunger Games and was on her way home toward the end of the first book? Collins does a fantastic job of throwing curve balls throughout her books. That is, she's very unpredictable. She makes it seem as though the capitol could not get worse; that the tyranny associated with it had reached its limit, and once again I was wrong. However, it seems as though this book has the same middle as \\"The Hunger Games\\" but with a different beginning and end. However, the middle portion of this book is absolutely fascinating. Granted, it's not quite as fascinating as \\"The Hunger Games\\" because the first book included all new aspects to the reader such as the Hunger Games itself. The constant mumbling of \\"tic-toc\\" by Wiress became quite chilling once the truth was revealed; that the arena was a clock. The ongoing question is who Katniss will choose; Peeta or Gale. This combined with a twist ending makes this a great page-turner. However, the opening chapters are quite dull, but it's worth it.
B008602KQI|5.0|This exciting book has everything. Excellent characters, nail biting suspense, a brave young hero that changes the world! I highly recommend all three books in this series. Also amazing is that I read all three books for free on my Kindle Fire using the Amazon Prime Lending Library. w00t!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|great action movie tom cruise does not dissapoint....non stop action...and the storty line from the previous mission impossibles stay intact.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|the book was of course a thousand times better...should watch movie first..then read the book...that way the movies wont be such a disappointment
B0042KZJ5K|5.0|I'm always searching for something new or interesting in music, and this album brought me something that was OLD and FASCINATING.<br /><br />The songs are fantastic, and from here I tracked down and have come to love many of the artists that contributed to the album such as Dan Tyminksi and Alison Krauss.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0056TYT66|5.0|My computer was manufactured just before both the USB 3.0 and SATA 6GB/s formats came on scene.  I do a significan amount of both photographic and DVD production on the computer and speed is a factor, especially with the DVDs.  I added this card, along with a Solid State Drive (SSD) and the speed is significantly greater!  Before, on a DVD that took about one hour to render, with the new combination of card and SSD, it now takes about forty-five minutes to produce the same video.  Loading the work into the production program saves a lot of time too.  I'm very happy with the card/SSD combination and won't be needing a new computer for a long time.<br /><br />I've only used this card for the SATA drive so far, but I'm getting an external hard drive for additional storage and I expect that the faster speed will be just as helpful as it was for the SSD.<br /><br />Update:  I recently added an external USB 3.0, 3TB hard drive as a back-up drive.  Once again, the Adapter has performed perfectly.
B008XG1X18|4.0|crashes once a day. but other than that a good ap...  I like using it on kindle fire over using a pc
0345803507|5.0|I don't read these type of books but she does so happy life, happy wife etc bought them for her, well worth it. She has now read the entire trilogy!!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Among the top ten books for me being  one of  The most beautiful love stores I have ever read - describing  A connection between two people beyond belief
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was like the book.  I know time frame didnt allow all the things about the characters that was important to know.  But as long as had the book could fill in things.  SO book answered questions and the movie made the story compelling to watch.  LOVED it and cant wait for next TWO movies to go with the other books.  I am going to be so sad to see this saga ending so quickly...my interest is at its peak after reading all three books.  SOOO many scenerios within each book that could be expanded!!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|I feel the Hunger Games is a really good movie. If there is anything bad about it, I would say that the movie is not long enough.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|I'm a fan of Crouch, but this one never grabbed me like his other works.  Too much Twighlight Zone for my taste.
B0080CL0HM|4.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely, I had been waiting almost 2 years to see it. I knew the story line, and I enjoy period pieces.This did not disappoint me. the cast was outstanding. with many years of acting under their belts. I've seen Robert pattinson, and his series of twilight movies. but he won me over in Water for Elephants. so I was eager to see this movie. I know most were expecting a little bit more sex, due to the nature of the character and story line. I enjoyed watching how much power, the women did have over the men. It made you wonder if they realize it or didn't care. The sets and costumes, pulled you into a time long forgotten. In the plot with it's hate, revenge, and sexual desires. there is always someone scheming for something. whether it was for love or power, it kept you wondering what was next. Even the mystery behind the count. I enjoyed this movie enough I'm considering purchasing it. I know watching it only once, I missed some of the characters hidden agendas, and there seem to be a lot of them.<br /> all in all it was worth the wait.
0345803493|5.0|They say a happy wife means a happy life, well yes it does. Recently had surgery and she is off work (and bored silly) so she asked me to get these books for her. She really doesn't read much but has finished all of these now she wants me to read them. Er yeah well see maybe. But it kept her entertained. Well worth it.
B008M34CSI|2.0|Wanted.to like.this.show.cause.i.was.in the mood.for.scifi. Poor cg could have.been overlooked.but the.cornball overthe.top writing staff really.brought this movie down. The main characters.were somewhat likable but the dialog was.just pathetic.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|If you did not read the book you will probably love this movie, if you did - be warned that this movie was pretty much a disappointment. I guess I find that to be true with most movies, when I have read the book beforehand then the movie fails. I just get so frustrated when they change the story line for no apparent reason. It was just ok, wouldn't watch it again.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|I feel that X-Men: First Class is a really good movie. I would say that its rating of PG-13 is appropriate.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is one of the good ones this year.  It does a good job of giving the viewer the best of the story from a wonderful book.  Can't wait for the next 2 movies in this series!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the entire trilogy. Every book held my attention from beginning to end. I didn't want the third book to end. This is a must read!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Awesome app, I would recommend this game to anyone. Whether you just have a second, minute, or hour to spare this is a good game to spend time on. I think some levels could be a bit more challenging though.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the best books I have read in years.  I smiled almost from the first page and couldn't put it down.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|A great laugh, loved it! I enjoyed all the movies in this series and this was no exception -well worth watching!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is so amazing it helps me every day with my home work..... it save me a lot of time
B00123KEPK|5.0|They didnt play this great double set from Yes much on the radio in the 70s due to the song structures. So I had never heard all of it prior to picking \\"Tales\\" up 40 years later. Its some of the best headphone music there is. Also the rare tracks are a nice addition but I would rather see them on an additional disc so I dont confuse them with the original material.
B00846REIS|5.0|I've read at first 50 Shades in April already and really loved it... Bared to you despite all the critics that it's just like 50 Shades, which is partly true, is still a great written book! I thought I give it a try and i wasn't disappointed; sometimes while reading I thought \\"mmh sounds familiar..\\" but i kept on reading and I've to say i can't wait for the second book to come out! The book has a different plot and it's worth giving a try!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and this app is above and beyond what the other offering was. It's super easy to use and has some great features
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Update to my earlier review (below): The TED Talks app for Android now has captions available! To enable subtitles while watching, look for the subtitle button (a speech bubble) in the lower left-hand corner of the video player & tap it to display language options. Subtitle tips are available under the app settings. Captions aren't available for each & every talk yet, but they are working on it!<br /><br />I love TED Talks, and this app is well done - high quality video, easy to navigate, works great on the Kindle Fire - except for one thing: the videos lack captions/subtitles. If the app offered captions I would definitely rate it 5 stars!<br /><br />I've enjoyed streaming TED Talks from their website for some time, and one of the best aspects of the site is that captions are available in many languages for each video. This is pretty much a necessity for anyone who is Deaf or hard of hearing or whose first language is not English to be able to enjoy a video or film. I am hard of hearing, so whether or not something has captions can often be a deal-breaker for me.<br /><br />If this app gets updated with captions, then I will change my 3-star rating to 5 stars. In the meantime I will continue to watch talks on the website & via Netflix.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Captivating, entertaining and fast paced read. Mr. Ludlum paints the pictures for your mind and brings the characters to life. The tension and suspense are thrilling.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Every Harry Bosch book is entertaining as well as thought provoking.  I have read 5 of his books so far and just can't wait to read them all.  Harry Bosch's character is interesting, sad, funny, sexy, smart, and makes the reader anticipate the next book in order to learn more about his career with the LAPD as well as his personal history.  Read them all!
B0031RS8NK|5.0|What a book!! Loved loves loved this one! But i really love anything by sophie kinsella. :)<br /><br />Great easy and funny read! You will not be dissapointed!
B008JAGZDE|5.0|I love the fact they brought everyone back and didn't replace anyone. If you like American Pie then you must see this.
B000NA2UMS|2.0|The vinyl record I ordered was said to be brand new-it did have the seal on it and all, but there were rips on the inside sleeve.
B008MJC6ZS|3.0|You can't go wrong buying this album. Dark Roots is actually better than their previous effort, \\"The Formation of Damnation.\\" It is good to hear Skolnick rip out some impressive leads once again. The vocals are great. Truth be told, I like every song on the album, but after listening to it for a week, I have put it back on the shelf. Don't get me wrong, Dark Roots is good metal, but does not have that hook that we hear in past albums like \\"Low\\" and \\"Practice What You Preach.\\" From a technical standpoint, the metal is good, but the songs just do not have that passion that Testament had back in the early 90's. The same can be said of Metallica, Kreator and Megadeth. At least they are still making metal, because there is a lot of bad music out there right now.
B000V6ADNW|5.0|This album is legendary for 50 cent but also the genre of Hip-hop. His gansta attitude was not exaggerated in any way,  shape or form. His claims of thug and hood life may be as authentic as they come. Each song on this album has unique potrayal of 50 cent, a fact that makes each song worthwhile. 50 is legendary, Get rich or Die tryin' is iconic, this is definitely one the New York classics of the 00's.
B005CRQ3LG|5.0|I love the storyline of Lucy Cousins Hooray for Fish. I needed a copy of this book for teaching in my art classes. My kindergarden and first grade classes will love it!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I didn't think that I would like it but its just hard enough to make you think for a little bit.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Love this case.  It was for my husband's Kindle Fire.  He likes that it looks like an old book.  And, the inside pocket is where he stores his airline ticket stub when he travels.  Very practical & slim.  Fits in the pocket of the plane seat, easily.
B008602KQI|5.0|Follows the book so close that readers will be pleased. The story line is very belivable and I was impressed how the director stayed so true to the book. Personally I can't wait for the next movie.
B003KVKQB4|5.0|I would highly recommend (and have to my friends) \\"The Shock Doctrine\\".  Ms. Klein has done extensive research to document her position as an anti-libertarian (anti-Milton Friedman) advocate.  Although reading this book caused a knot in my stomach, I believe it is important that the American people have the insight exposed in this book.
B006OKOZGU|4.0|Let me first start off with an Amazon gripe.  It's really annoying that Amazon lumps all reviews for the same title together, regardless of the format of the release.  Since many high def fans are especially interested in the quality of a blu-ray release vs. the DVD this is pretty terrible practice.  Shame Amazon!<br /><br />OK, now on to the review.  While I am not, in general, a big classic movie buff, I do have my favorites and I do love me some Hitchcock.  I've had the very poor quality DVD transfer of Hitchcock's classic thriller \\"To Catch a Thief\\" for quite a long time and my wife and I had started watching it recently (while I gritted my teeth at the terrible picture quality on my wonderful 65\\" plasma) when I decided to check to see if it was ever going to be released on Blu-Ray.  Of course I discovered it was already OUT on Blu-ray and I ordered it right away (we also turned off the DVD and decided to wait).<br /><br />So, how good of a job has the studio done with this classic?  They have done an outstanding job and I don't say that very often.  Color and contrast look remarkable for a film of this age (nearly 60 years!), in fact, this film looks much better than many much much newer blu-ray releases.<br /><br />I see virtually no dirt or scratches on the print, and while a few shots intentionally have soft focus, I don't see signs of edge enhancement on the numerous shots that have razor sharp focus of the principal actors.  You've never seen Cary Grant and Grace Kelly look quite this good before folks.  If you want a real visual treat, go straight to the \\"party scene\\" near the end of the film... my jaw was literally open for about 10 straight minutes because it looks THAT GOOD on my calibrated television.<br /><br />So, why did I ding this a star?  I don't feel that the audio track got quite the same treatment.  While it is evident that some work was done to clean up hiss and improve the audio fidelity, the audio in general sounds flat for a release of this caliber.  I would have really liked it, if in addition to the original 2-channel mix, they treated us to a new multi-channel mix to fully exercise our surround sound systems.  I think that this film in particular would have benefited here.<br /><br />All in all though, it's almost impossible to find any fault... this is an absolute MUST HAVE if you are a Hitchcock fan, a Grace Kelly or Cary Grant fan, or if you simply want some amazing reference material to use to show off the picture quality of your TV or projector.is caliber.

B004LROUNG|3.0|The book is classic Grisham. His city location descriptions feel very real and his characters are alive with personal complications that draw you back to see if they can finally be winners. In this one the underdog good guy brings us to a victory. The weakness is that it feels like it is all headed to the happy ending.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Just got my head and I also have to say he is overwhelmingly beautiful.<br />I love the TV Series, and now it finally has the right packaging.<br /><br />Hope we get the \\"Zombie Hands\\" packaging with Season 3!!!
B00448SE4S|5.0|But seriously its insanely fun, especially if you're a child of the 80's/90's who liked video games growing up. Edgar Wright is a genius.
B007SGM084|5.0|Excellent, captivating....want to see more of these characters.  I found the books to be well written and entertaining.  Great character development.  Definitely left me hungry for more about these characters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am not a big reader but figured since this was the trilogy everyone was talking about- I would give it a try.  I started with Fifty Shades Of Grey and 4 days later was onto Fifty Shades Freed!  This book was so addictive- I couldn't put it down and after I was done I was disappointed that there wasn't a fourth or fifth book too.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I loved the fact that I was cheering him and cursing her one minute and doing the exact opposite in the next chapter.  Some really interesting insights into how (seemingly)perfect love can sour slowly over time.  I was worried towards the last just how the author would or could wrap this up without the obvious ending but it was perfect in the end. Highly recommend.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|My daughters school recommended this book. She had trouble getting involved in the story and it did bother her that they kept changing who was telling the story. The ending was very predictable but it was an ok book for a younger reader
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Without making a judgement the book(s) should be known as, and advertised as, pornographic.This simply will give more information to a potential buyer to help make a decision to purchase.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent book  - very thought provoking - can we really pass a gene along through generations - good or bad.  Good comes from a good upbringing but bad from a 'gene' -something to think about isn't it.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Hours & hours pass while I play this fun/frustrating game. However it would be helpful to know what all the rules are. Love the animation, sounds,etc. my favorite game by far.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Bought this keyboard app after I rooted my LG Optima V in hopes that it would be a Swype keyboard replacement. It is not. Just another on-screen KB with a slightly different word learning algorithm.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie,great cast and special effects. The 2nd disk shows how the film was made and  was very informative, cant wait for the next series to be released.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I had heard that this was a great movie and I was not disappointed. I have not yet read the book so I am not sure how it compares, but now I am looking forward to diving into the novels as well! We watched this one night for Family Fun Night and everyone really enjoyed it. It is a well told tale and the acting and visuals keep you involved in the story. It definitely has that Big Brother Is Watching You feel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was uncertain as to whether I wanted to continue past book one due to the sexual content, but I did and am so glad.  Books two and three really show the love story and healing that Gray went through to have the life he never new he wanted.  It was an excetional series and for those who stopped reading after book one, I would highly reccommend you pick up the other two books and complete the series.  I don't think you will be sorry.  I hope to read more books from this author.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Purchased the Kindle version.  Very user friendly.  Of course it is not as easy as the book itself, but for the kindle I was very pleased.  It seems to have all the notes as the book.  I have not had any problems and for the $ it is well worth it and then some.  Easy to navigate to and from other books, notes, etc.  Great product.
B008BSOAPE|5.0|John Green is basically the best person on this earth and I will buy anything he writes. That should be enough of a review.
B008DYZKQE|4.0|This is a cute story of female empowerment.  I read this to my first daughter who is now 21 years old and she loved it.  I had forgotten about the book but was happy to rediscover it with my 5 year recently.
B005KB0SU6|5.0|Captivating alluring !! Loved it!!<br />A must read in any language.<br />Can't wait to read all of his books. My hat is off to Carlos Ruiz Zafon.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This is one of the funniest book I've ever read.<br />It's not a book just for kids, but for everyone.
B00846REIS|4.0|Similar to Fifty Shades, felt like I was reading it all over again. It's for those of you that want more...
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I could not wait to read the second book in the series.  It is getting a bit more interesting and as hot as first book.  Very easy reading not difficult. Have started 3rd and final book.
B0052RCX0G|5.0|I like this book because it show you the world history from individual items. I really want to visit British Museum someday after reading this book.
B008602KQI|2.0|People need to stick to the books I do not recommen this movi this movie for anyone under anyone under 15 I was disap I was disappointed in this movie
B008602KQI|5.0|this is one of my favorite book series and I couldn't wait for the movie to come out to theaters. It is always hard to follow a book exactly, but Gary Ross teamed up with Susan Collins and did an excellent job in creating this movie and bringing it to life.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very cool n fun not much complex to sooth brain. very well designed. kids love it very much<br />thank you
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a fabulous read! Everyone was talking about the sex in the book but that was secondary to the story and by the second and third books it was almost redundant but the saga of Christian and Anna was the best!
B008BM9L72|5.0|i couldnt put these books down they where very well written i read all three books in about 2 weeks i think great reading
B008CP92ZO|3.0|Could have been better. Worth seeing if you have nothing else to do. Some very funny parts though. Why not!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This must be one of the worst written books I have read in many, many years. The writing is amateurish and almost middle school. It was predictable and uninspiring, the reason why Jane Austen was moved to write such brilliant novels a hundred years ago.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author gave a true personal perspective of her journey both on foot and mentally. The ending wrapped it up on a positive note, which is refreshing. I did not want to reach the end!
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought it was just as good if not better then the fifty shades trilogy. I am excited to start reading the second one!
B008LXZFH6|1.0|This was extremely distasteful and should have been given an R rating.  I found nothing entertaining about this film nor would I recommend it.
B00122BEPA|5.0|Very nice collection.  Some newer stuff I hadn't heard before but really like.  \\"Ain't talking 'bout love\\" with the original DLR and a live version with SH makes for interesting listening.  Really worth the $s if you like any version of \\"The Halen\\"!  EVH never left so all the guitar shreds!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this is the first book I have read by this author. This book was so good that I plan on reading the rest of the series. The book was exciting with not a minute of boredom. I loved it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just got through the full trilogy of this book series. I absolutely enjoyed it. The only down side is that I watched the movie first THEN read the book. But either way, I really liked them both.
B004SBX112|4.0|I like Angry Bird Seasons.  I play it often, although not too well.  lol  It has a lot of variety and good graphics.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book was very good you really do not want to put in down because, now you a feeling for her.  The ending of Book I leaves you wanting to know more of what is coming next. Looking to reading Book II soon.
B008602KQI|5.0|I'm over 50 yet enjoyed this series. It had suspense,greed, love, and science.fi.,.  What more could omeone want? Let the odds be with you.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I had my issue with this book and glad that to see an argument not end with them having sex. I still have a lot of question about Ana.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time.  WOW would be my best discription.  I do hope she writes more like this soon.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Did not like it, wish I hadn't bought the book. Deleted it from my Kindle. Will not watch the movie either.
B005ISQ7JM|3.0|Nothing special. Just basic stuff.<br />No examples of code or details.<br />Good for early beginners. May be good for schools.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series of books are awesome! I do not read it is hard for me to sit down with a book and do that. However I downloaded these to my Kindle and WOW could not put them down!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I expected the book to live up to it's reviews.I found it predictable and depressing. I COULD put it down. Not well written. Very creepy.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|This is a cute little app, that gives you the same information as the built in battery status gives regarding state of charge. All of the other information such as estimated available time would only be useful if you are in a situation where you are on a tight schedule etc and no power source was readily at hand.<br />The thing it will not tell you is if the battery is about to die on you, and give an alert in time to do something about a backup.<br />As a free app it is ok, but it is not essential enough to be a paid app.
B007VYAJAE|2.0|If you're into not working, smoking weed, and making (young) women subservient to you then you'll love this movie! The movie itself was fine, well produced, and portrayed Marley in a neutral light. I was interested in learning more about the man, but now I'm glad that I was never into his music. I have to admit that if I didn't have a streaming video credit, I would not have wasted the money on the movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book. You become emotionally attached to the characters and it always keeps you guessing what will happen next. Looking forward to Walking Disaster!
B008602KQI|3.0|This was a really good movie if you read the book after it. To answer the voids they left in the movie. But like most movies that come from books the books are usually better.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. It helps me cook food and serve it. I like it a lot.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I was very pleasantly surprised at just how fun this game is.  Nice graphics, music and sound effects, and plenty of challenging puzzles.  Great work!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is not a book review per se; this is what I felt when I read the book.  Totally loved the fractured writing with a his/her perspective.  Totally loved the ending that really was no ending.  Definitely will read the next book by this author.  The story caught me from the beginning and held me until the end...you can't give a story more praise than that.  Lastly, cleverly written.  What a wonderful story that truly was worth reading.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|This movie is boring. Its about a bunch of kids running around the woods killing each other. You keep waiting for it to get better and it never does. Not worth the money!!
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Marley is a very insightful view of Bob Marley's life, music, social impact and death.<br />If nothing else, it prompted me to re-connect with the music.
B004YRSBTW|5.0|Momento is those kind of films which even after the film is complete you would look at other people in the theater beside you and discuss whether what you figured out was right or there was something you missed and for the entire portion of film, the director does not spoon feed the audiences and one has to be alert, on their toes and keep analyzing the film to really enjoy it, by narrating the film in a reverse order you are forced on to the shoes of the protagonist, and at the end of the film one really does not know whether the hero has killed the right person or not and this is intentionally done.<br /><br />christapher nolan is a genius, and this is one of his gem's.
B001661RC2|5.0|This is what true American rock music is. This album is in my Top 10 right now. Give it a spin, you'll like it too!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good book with a lot of unexpected twists and turns. You will never guess how it ends! You will enjoy the book
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was the perfect compliment between racy and exciting! I loved the drama of it all. The whole story finally came together! LOVED IT!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Yes, Fifty Shades Freed is a page turner, but the constant use of the same phasing is redundant. Rolling eyes and the cocking of the head, got old fast.  Although it was the topic of most of my friend and my conversation,  most of it was making fun of the writing style.  Good for a laugh!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love having this on my Kindle Fire. It is a bit buggy but for a hugely popular and busy app it does well. Main issue I have is it likes to freeze and the lovely &quot;..... is not responding &quot; box pops up, as if the blank white screen I've stared at for the past 2 minutes was not a key tipoff of that obvious fact. But the second time I start the app it works every time.
B005NNVPOO|5.0|Great work from Pink Floyd.  You can hear a little bit of Mettle, Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here....somewhat transitional from old PF to newer PF.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I travel a lot and putting on the night sounds of home (frogs, rain, crickets) really helps me get to sleep in new places.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|Not brilliant, not hugely ambitious, too long, boring middle, nice ending. Read to Part 4, then skip to Part 9 and you won' t miss a thing
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is an excellent book--well-written and easy to read, and information that is groundbreaking.  The author delves into habits, how they are formed and how we can change them.  Habit change is so difficult that I have always felt it's impossible to change them, but this book gives information that they can be changed, and a roadmap on how to change them.
B006LSZECO|5.0|At first I didn't think I would like this book, didn't think it was my type.  But halfway through, I took me by surprise.  I loved it!
B0080OJBQW|5.0|The cd by Adam Lambert titled  Trespassing-- deluxe version is rich with words that sing to the heart and cut to the truth. Sometimes ,sadly, it takes trespassing to make people realize the repercussions of their actions. Adam's songs will  give you insight to anyone who understands the value of loving and they do this with the call to dance. The extra tracks are worth it too. All this comes from a man who will be 70 in a few days ,but remembers what it was like to be young and gay and in love. You certainly  Do not have to be any  of the four to  relish this work .Super!
B00899DV6O|1.0|Bought this as a surprise for a friend. Can't imagine EVER buying this crap again...for any reason!  Save your $ and give it to the Log Cabin Republicans.
B008602KQI|5.0|I hate that many books and movies get lumped into age groups. Great stories can be enjoyed no matter what your age is. This is one of them.
B007SGM084|5.0|I finally gave in and bought the trilogy to see what all the hype was about... could. not. put. it. down... The story pulls you in and won't leave you alone, even when you aren't reading it! I definitely recommend this quick easy read :)
B00688628M|4.0|Very well-written and well-played series. It tells the story of Easy Company from the jump trainings till the end of WWII. It tries to illustrate the cheos of WWII and it nails it. This is a must-watch-before-you-die kind of series.<br /><br />I would also recommend The Pacific. If you like Band of Brothers, then you'd love the Pacific.
B008602KQI|5.0|My daughters and I saw this when it was out in the theater and loved it.  So naturally, we had to own a copy of it when it hit the DVD market.  My husband was not able to see the movie the first time we saw it, but he read the book series before he saw the DVD and he was not disappointed.  I think this is a great movie to teach your kids about self sacrafice, and learning to put others needs in front of your own.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Twist and turns a-plenty!!! I enjoyed this read! Great characters, excellent plot, and you just didn't know what was coming next! Worth the time!
B007ZBWJXI|4.0|Well, It was good to see the original line up reunited back then when \\"Phoenix\\" was released, The band needed it, needed to refresh, but, how can a band get fresh with and old lineup? Well, you can ask these veterans or just listen to their three most recent recordings. With XXX, Asia delivers another album with their classic sound yet with a fresh taste, the only bad thing is not all the songs have the same quality, some of them, not fillers but not thrillers either. The first couple of songs should rank among the best they have all time.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I found this book to be the new housewives boredom breaker. It is poorly written and if I have to read the words \\"he rubbed his finger around my sex\\" another time I'll throw up!!!<br /><br />I'm sure many secondary school girls will be handing it around the school yard with highlighted phrases ala Lady Chatterleys Lover.<br /><br />Disappointing overall.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love it. no issues. use it on my kindle fire. easy to navigate, love the real~time updates. thanks for a great app!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very realistick and well researched historically. I liked the way all separate stories continued to be brought under the same roof and made part of the whole. Everybody cares about each other even for the \\"bad guy\\". It made me think about how society used to be, and how much is missing in this day and age were everybody is to busy to care and than complain that \\"no body dos\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written novel with an excellent critique on the human condition of oppression. The sequels are a must and I recommend this to anyone. The movie was also very close to the book, worth a watch.
B0085776BG|4.0|I have always been, and always will be, a huge fan of the P-51 Mustang fighter.  So, having said that, the GCI still needs improvement but it's getting better.  Eventually they'll get it to point that GCI animation will be like flat out being there personally.  Keep workin' on it, folks.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|My husband and I absolutely love this show! I was hesitant to get into it at first, because I thought it was just another crime drama, and I've had enough of the incarnations of CSI and SVU, but Bones is different. It's a great show with great writing!<br /><br />Season 7 is shorter than normal, because Emily Deschanel was pregnant in real life, so they shortened the season to accommodate that. Still a good season, though, and the finale is a cliffhanger.
B008602KQI|4.0|what was wrong about this is that it should have gotten here the day it came out not two days after . I a bought it in advance at least get it the day of release .
B006LSZECO|4.0|Best story yet! A tale of ultimate mind manipulation. Although the ending was a little dissappointing. Could have given up more about their future.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|The long-awaited (by some, not me) screen adaptation of the first novel in the 'Hunger Games' trilogy was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. Plot and character development sometimes played second fiddle to the heavy-handed anti-establishment theme that undoubtedly made it so appealing to its intended audience. Other than the two tribute characters from district 12 and their drunken mentor, the other characters were puppets populating a wooden vista against which the drama played out. I wasn't expecting a lot, so the visual affects were a very pleasant surprise. Tarantino doesn't have to worry about being replaced in the action-adventure genre by Gary Ross, but his action sequences were 'OK'. I know this is a tepid review, but there wasn't much to get excited about. If you have a couple of hours to spare, by all means stream it, but I wouldn't watch it again so I wouldn't purchase the DVD.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Great book, I did not want to put it down and can't wait to get started on the other Theodore Boone series.
B008XFB86Y|5.0|Outstanding movie! Very action packed! Fight scenes are coreographed perfectly with some really interesting touches! Recommended this to every adult i know! 5 stars
B003JXUXPW|5.0|This album has become one of my favorites.  Mr. Porter has a rich and soulful voice. His music can be put in line with the Jazz greats
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Some of my friends thought this was the weakest book.  I thought it held up to the others and I think it may be my favorite!
B008602KQI|5.0|Wonderful movie! Almost as exciting as the books. I would highly recommend this! Definitely a must-see! It's action packed but also has a personal side. The characters are interesting, and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B003T6GVWI|4.0|Madonna needs to consult Kylie on how an \\"aging\\" pop queen should make modern pop music.  I know she's not for everyone, but she's very listenable.  Unlike MDNA.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|a great game to forget the day and pass time between buses. while I don't really play as much as I should, why should I when it is at my fingertips waiting for more
B007KOYEOC|1.0|OK, I asked for it.  On a recent sailing trip in Croatia four girls had their noses in a couple of well thumbed copies of the first book in this trilogy.  My travelling companion gave in - and so it began.  Most of her comments were about how much sex there was - sounded almost salacious, and as I discovered, for the first two books, there is not much else but sex.  This is seriously some of the most boring, trashy writing I have ever read - which make it perfect for long haul flights, and that's how I did 1 and 2.  If fantasy land and the idea of the gorgeous, yet wounded Christian Grey (who also throws away world's best orgasms like confetti) is your thing, then knock yourself out.  By the time I got to book three, the whole saga was getting ridiculous, the characters more annoying, the writing more shaky.  I mean, 'jeez', if I could list the cliche's I be here for hours.  Fortunately for me, I have a lovely new book by a real author (although possibly not a really rich one, which EL James undoubtedly is now after we were all sucked in by blanket publicity), with a real story, and real characters. Still not convinced?  Then by al means, make EL James a little richer and speed read the first two next time you're standing in a check out queue.  Those around who've read it will know your reading about 'blinding good sex'.  And the others will just think 'how quaint'.  Don't bother with this one though, even I had better things to do.
B000IYU9IG|4.0|this is one of my favorite john wayne films. with maureen o'hara at his side it is part comedic and historical. john wayne plays john wayne. it is a lighter side of some of his dramas.
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|It is , indeed, a manual for one's every day life. Recommend ! Read it and recognize yourself. Every page reminded me of me at some point of my life.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have fun mixing sounds, but found it can become a distraction. The app works well on my SG2 and Pantech Element and I experience no glitches so far.
B00846TTDG|4.0|Great movie. Effects are great. Makes you see what seals can do! A must see film. Even the wife enjoyed it.
B008602KQI|5.0|Hunger Games is going to be the next great trilogy! This first movie was amazing!! I can't wait to see how the second one turns out!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series isn't just about the sex! It is the love story that every girl dreams. A broken man that falls in love and changes just for her! I will read these books over and over again.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It's good to see a game where the developer's attention to detail really shines.  Playing this is such a pleasant experience and a welcome change from a lot of the games I've played recently.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Great characters and intriguing plot. I couldn't wait to find out the answer to the mystery. A little slow at first but once Eliza's story started moving along I couldn't put it down. This book made me want to read more Kate Morton books.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I was enjoying the variety and ease of use and the app was functioning flawlessly, so I upgraded. I have not experienced any problems with either version.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|It was a very good movie that keep my attention and it was different and very well written and the plot was great.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I found the last installment less interesting than the first two. While there are a couple of nice twists there is just not enough novelty and many boring parts.
B003CI90MQ|3.0|This is a great book, especially for people starting to get serious about learning their camera. However, the book is  dated.<br /><br />Sure, the concepts are timeless, but whenever Scott references specific gear or that only 'high end' professional cameras have more than 10 megapixels, it really makes you notice that you paid for a five year old book. Especially when part 4, which is six months old, is only $3 more.<br /><br />If they are serious about releasing new books that build on the earlier parts, then one would assume that they expect people to read the earlier volumes. It wouldn't take much to have a sub-editor go through the book and update the references that really date the book - in the same way that school/university textbook publishers do.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|The movie was good but not as expected.  There was too much anticipation for this movie that it affected the viewing.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Courageous is a must see film for the whole family.  This movie could change our society for the good of everyone.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|The man who wrote this book won't even use his real name.  That tells you something.  He's a traitor to his comrades in arms as all members sign that they wouldn't reveal info for 17 years.  Do you want the terrorists to learn how our Seal Teams operate?  Well,  this man did just that.<br /><br />If you buy this book,  you are not only supporting him but you are condoning his actions just to satisfy your 'curiosity'.  And you are giving this traitor money for his giving info to the terrorists.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I hope Baldacci continues adding more titles to this series. There is a lot of excitment throughout this book and keeps you wanting to find out what will happen next.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Although initially a slow start, Wool Omnibus picks up speed and pulls the reader into a future dystopia that holds your interest.  The extent of the deception dawns slowly but is profound.
B008602KQI|5.0|great movie, my nephew was a peace keeper.  blu-ray and surround sound are a great way to enjoy this movie.  great price, great delivery.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book. He romaanced her and actually wanted to give her more of himself. The trilogy is a great read!
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games Movie is wonderful. It is based on the book series. Although movies based on books often don't live up to the readers expectations this movie did very well. I am glad I bought the movie! I would recommend it to my friends and family.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|With the recent buzz about making the third movie, I had to check out the previous two. It helped that Amazon Instant Video offers it for free. And so I watched the two in order. To be honest, I stopped several times over a course of about two weeks before I finished the first movie, Before Sunrise. The premise was good and their meeting was simple enough, but then it just dragged on and on as the two exchanged barbs on one topic and then the next. I understand it was their labored way of getting close to its climactic conclusion, but I didn't enjoy the process.<br /><br />And so I was hesitant to watch the second one. I read some reviews to see what others thought (I didn't want to waste 2 hours of my time), and with good reviews, I jumped in.<br /><br />Excellent movie. Rather than a whole 1/2 day to spend together, the two were given 1-2 hours. That sped up the whole process to my liking. In the process, they sucked me into their pains and found me rooting for them to get together (even though the guy is already married!) Yikes! Enjoyed the ride...but hated the ending. Give us 10 more minutes!
B0086DBE62|1.0|This movie was so poorly acted that my daughter and I turned it off about 30 minutes into the viewing. We kept thinking it would get better, we had hope because we are Julia Roberts fans but we finally gave up and moved on. We both say... don't even bother.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Wild was an enjoyable read. The story of an adventure that was unexpected and unplanned.  Given the authors amateur status as an outdoors person she did really well and has messages that we all can appreciate, share and learn. An excellent read and worth the time and expense to enjoy.........
B008602KQI|2.0|Children's killing children. I really don't understand how something like this can be so popular. I guess it's just a sign of our times.
B008602KQI|5.0|Expert casting and input from the author really makes this adapt to a movie well.  A lot of detail needs to be left out, but reading the book fills in to create a more complete experience.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Diana Gabaldon has a way of telling a story that pulls you in. You find yourself cheering for the heroin, and and seeing the human side of the bad guy. I have seriously enjoyed her books.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Young adult coming of age that reaches teenagers and adults alike. Fast, yet insightful read. A Catcher in the Rye for a younger generation.
B0086700CM|5.0|A good free app that works well and is easy to use liked it very much especially as it is free.
B007SGM084|5.0|Never read a book like these, but absoluely loved them! Not surprised either I learned a little from them as well ;) My fiance loved that part about these! It is a good fantasy to lose yourself in and the way it draws you into them its crazy! Cannot wait to see if there will be a movie!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A fun puzzle game that is simple to play, but incredibly difficult to put down. Starts easy, but gets very demanding at the higher levels. And its free :)
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this every night to go to sleep quickly.  I travel a lot for business and having the same sounds I have at home to sleep is a great way to get a good night's sleep while in a strange motel bed.
B007WTR2W6|4.0|This is a decent book. Lots of startup books concentrate on the potentially huge, when most people don't have the stones for that size of risk. Just making a living without anybody bothering you is a good goal for ordinary startups and this book takes care of that. Plenty of nice examples if a little repetitive.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Really keeps me interested. Nice colors, keeps my mind alert and active. I enjoy this type of game and word games. I am trying to keep my mind sharp, these games help.<br />Thank you
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|A good free app that works well and is easy to use liked it very much especially as it is free.
1567184855|5.0|This book was a great read. It opened up my mind to other things and helped me with the loss of my father. Journey of Souls is definitely a journey!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The two authors, Gibbs and Duffy, went so on the mark. I remember each campaign and each president's history with his followers. I knew lilttle about Hoover and was pleased to find out what an enormous help he was to Truman. I have always resented the fact that while Roosevelt was a dying man, they kept his VP in the dark. At times, Truman was petty  when he took umbredge with Drew Pearson giving a true criticism of his daughter's singing voice. As Presdient he was criticizing the first amendment. Nevertherless his ideas for the rebirth of Europe were monumental.<br />I have one criticism, they were wrong when they said that George W. Bush voluteered to go into the Air Force, as his father did. He was in the National Guard and he then was campaigning for some Republican candidate and didn't even fulfil his time there.<br /><br />Other than that, I woujld give ten stars if I could and wonder why it isn't on the best seller list. I like the fact that most of them agre that once out of office they will not criticize the one in office.Jimmy Carter often stepped out of line and wanted to step m,opre than one foot ahead.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am nearly half way through the Hunger Games Trilogy and find that I have a difficult time putting it down.  This has been, by far, the most entertaining series that I have read in quite a long while.  It runs the gamut of emotions pulling you along breathlessly.  I find myself eagerly anticipating the next adventure.  The characters are so believeable that I feel like I have known them all of their lives and wish to help them solve their many problems and ease their heartaches.<br /><br />All in all I would rate this an excellent read!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I read the book first and waited for the movie to be released on DVD before watching it.  It definitely lacked the depth that you got from the book, but I think they did a pretty decent job with the movie.  Not sure if I liked it enough to \\"own\\" the video but if it came on TV again, I would watch it!
B003WJQ74E|4.0|Its very light and fast to read. Liked it a lot. The main idea resembles the russian: \\"Woe from Wit\\" a lot.  Gives you something to think about after.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|A good free app that works well and is easy to use liked it very much especially as it is free.
B007JLCO34|5.0|I wish I grew up with this book, but I just read it now and I adore it. Louisa May Alcott has a wonderful voice, the characters are such relatable girls that they feel like dear friends, and the strong message of Christianity is an important theme. I believe every girl should read this book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three of the books. I really enjoyed each one and I hope there will be more to come!
B008MEM24S|5.0|My daughter really likes this game and I have to admit I have become alittle addicted to it as well. It is definitely challenging enough and makes one think about the best process to accomplish each mission. I hope they develop more levels for it.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Another Jamie McGuire book that had me up all night reading!! Loved it and cannot wait for the next one 😊
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the most amazing trilogy I have EVER read.... Beware tho you may get depressed when it is over, because there is no more... That's how I feel! I could only beg of E.J. James to write more and more and more!!!!! I have been sucked over to the fifty shades of grey side forever l!!!!! Best book ever!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A good free app that works well and is easy to use liked it very much especially as it is free.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Overall this book was ok. Not terrible, not great. The story moved forward with each chapter being told from a different person's perspective. This prevented me from connecting with the book, as the main character in the book (other than the narrator who is really just reporting) is humanity as a whole. It had interesting stories but there wasn't any action driving the book forward. It was easy for me to put it down. I don't regret reading it, but it wasn't one of my favorites.
B003E74B24|5.0|The book was magnificent and Gordon's story it's amazing!!! Hi's life it's a role model of hard work and sacrifice.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book is very interesting. It really makes you think about your rights as an individual and have they been compromised. It also helps you realize the uniqueness of each individual. It scary to think about what people went through before they started regulating the medical field.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|If you liked the first one, you'll like this one. I enjoyed it and so did my girlfriend. At times it was a little bit hard to follow but the original was the same way.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Great app on the kindle! It's not like the mobile app but it has the same features as if you were logged into your desk top. Only thing I dont like about this version for the kindle is whenever you log into twitter, it doesn't allow you to see your feed where you left off,like the mobile edition, instead it starts you at the very most current tweet.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|A good free app that works well and is easy to use liked it very much especially as it is free.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Loved it! Once I started I couldn't put it down. I started with the shopaholic series and this is a great addition to my collection.
B000HF6ZR0|3.0|It follows the book pretty well but I think if you don't read it before the movie, you won't really get it. I love the book, but the movie was just okay.
B00122RFOO|5.0|I hadn't listened to Van Morrison for years (and I do mean years) when I downloaded this album.  I remembered playing it over and over when it was new, and as I heard it again, I remember why: crystal clear perfect rock.  And then I heard something else under it all: blues and jazz running through it all.  Who knew?  I had to listen to a lot of other music to come back to this album from my 20th year and hear it all brand new.  Well worth the wait.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This story is along the lines of \\"The Help\\".  Captured the historical era well.  Characters were well developed and the action complex enough to keep you reading to see how situations would be resolved. It is the type of story that I would encourage younger women, especially young women of color,  to read so they will appreciate the struggles of their fore-mothers. Highly recommend.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Maybe THE Most fascinating story I've ever read! Truly inspiring. It inspired me to focus on building great products and forget hunting for profit only..
B004SOR4H6|4.0|The app works well most of the time though does glitch when updating sometimes. It was easy and fast yo download and easy to use.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|The good: It installed easily and doesn't crash my Android 2.3 phone (LG MyTouch Q).<br /><br />The not-so-good: Mediocre variety and selection of music, at best. No obvious way to use Amazon.com MP3 credits. No idea what happened to the song I selected and thought I downloaded.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|An awesome rebirth of a superhero charater. And the series just gets better. If you haven't seen this one, then you're missing out. Best seen on blu ray with a quality surround sound system. Enjoy.
B008602KQI|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie. It didn't take away from the excellence of the book.  I thought they actually did a good job considering most movies aren't able to live up to the expectations following a book.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so cool I love it!!!!!!!!!it is so challenging my friends like it 2 yeah lol yeah yeah osm aaa
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Loved the ending of the story. I was happy that both of them got their happy ending after everything they went through since they meet.
B0058W74UY|5.0|A good free app that works well and is easy to use liked it very much especially as it is free.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Almost everybody knows about Wikipedia, the free, online encyclopedia! There's lots that can be said about Wikipedia, both good and bad, but this review isn't about Wikipedia the site; it's about Wikipedia, the Android App.<br /><br />This app is terrific for looking things up quickly, because at least on cheaper, slower Android phones like my LG MyTouch Q, it loads and runs much faster than a web browser does. Unlike many dedicated apps, the Wikipedia App does a very good job of implementing the most useful features of the full site while still maintaining fast operation, simple navigation and fine readability on a small screen.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My kids love this movie. The first day they watched it three time son a row. It is an instant classic that sends a strong message.
B0085776BG|3.0|Not a lot of action as expected in a so callled great movie -parts were boring-I felt parts were a bit exagerated
B007J4T2G8|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME...................AND THEN SOME. IT WAS AN AMAZING READ!  KEPT ME \\"BOUND\\" THE WHOLE TIME! WELL WORTH THE MONEY AND TIME! BUSY WITH \\"DARKER\\". CANT WAIT!!!!!
B00846TRHY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh and cry. Out is horrible what goes on over there and what happens to those poor children.  I'm really glad I decided to rent it.
B00846REIS|3.0|While this book is entertaining to read and decently well written, it reeks with tons of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" ripoffs. Instead of following the turbulent relationship of Christian and Anastasia from \\"Fifty\\", we follow Gideon and Eva. Gideon, like Christian, is wealthy, owns his own company, uses his power and status to get women to sleep with him, and is majorly and completely messed up in the head. Eva, like Anastasia, is not impressed by Gideon or the way he is so blunt about his intentions. She is attracted to him, but not by his methods of persuasion. We go back and forth throughout the book with these two characters as they struggle to fit together. The binding glue of their relationship is ultimately sex, and both parties are aware they have many other issues causing their relationship to function much like that of a roller coaster.<br /><br />While I enjoyed this book as a carefree, fun and easy read, of course it's not how most real relationships are. This book, as well as \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" should be read as fictional, since that's what they are. Of course most women don't appreciate being treated like walking and talking sex machines, and a lot of the \\"scenes\\" in this book are not very realistic. I appreciate the differences that the author tried to insert in this book (Eva is very sexually experienced unlike Ana in Fifty) and ultimately I wish she had done that a little more in order to distinguish this from \\"Fifty.\\" I do plan on reading book two to see where the story takes the couple, and I'm hoping there's not marriage and a baby in store for Gideon and Eva. It would just be too predictable!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This movie was so good, unexpected, emotional, full of great actors, graphics, the story line was so interesting, loved this movie.
B00633W614|5.0|I can't wait for the sequel. I love a good old fashioned rags to riches story. It was a very inspiring story,
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Panem is a world built on the remains of our present, and is divided into twelve districts controlled by the Capitol. Once the districts rebelled against the Capitol but they lost the war. The way found by the Capitol to punish the rebels was to destroy one of the districts and organise \\"The Hunger Games\\": every year each district has to send a boy and a girl - the tributes - to an arena to fight to death against the tributes of the other districts. Katniss volunteers to the games to take the place of her younger sister and Peeta, the son of the baker, is randomly chosen to pair up with Katniss as the tributes of District 12. The whole thing is televised as a huge reality TV show and humanity seems completely lost for those who bet on the children and are thrilled by each death.<br /><br />This has to be one of the fastest paced books I have ever read. It is amazingly well written! This book is the first of a trilogy so I knew the end would be a cliffhanger to make me run for the second book ([[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2)]]). It is surprising how I loved Katniss although her main instinct is to survive to get back to sister, even if it means killing everything that moves and compromising her feelings. The easy to love Peeta shows the tenderness that seems to have abandoned everyone else as he doesn't mind losing, which means being killed, if that makes Katniss the winner. Reading the way characters grow while fighting for survival and finding surprising allies is extremely enjoyable. The whole Panem is exceptionally well thought and this book is a pleasure to read, even if the whole idea of children killing each other sounds like a awful premise. A must read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a very nice app. Easy and convenient to play. I enjoy it and have so much fun with it.
B007IE4DSG|4.0|All one can really say is what a delightful journey into some of his greatest post Beatle's tunes. Nothing on here is ragged or hagged, just some stripped down tunes with sparkle & beauty,great stuff that they have been released to the public..Harrison's humour shines through also what a blessing..great quality..& much appreciated! Thank you for sharing this!!
B004LROUNG|2.0|The book as with all Grisham books was an easy read. My attention was captured immediately and I didn't want to put the book down. However, I was disappointed by the time I finished the book. I felt the ending was contrived and the plot and subplots were disjointed. The book in the end left me unfullfilled and confirms my suspicions that Grisham has lost his edge.
034580404X|5.0|I am not someone who likes to read books, I am a very visual person, it is hard to keep my focus but the Fifty Shades Trilogy is unbelievable, I loved it from the get go, I have never read 3 books so quick, when I got to the last book half way through I actually tried to read only a little each day because I didn't want it to end but that really didn't work because I couldn't wait to see what happened to Christian and Ana. It is such a great mixture of romance, love, passion, sex, intrigue, pain, and sorrow. All of the critics that say it does not have a story must not have read the same books I read, the story kept my attention, his past and how she gave us little bits at a time made us invested in him and wanting to know more of how things were for him and how his past shaped his future. I can't say enough about these books and how they made me feel, I cried, laughed, smiled, blushed, learned new things, and became brave about trying new things in the bedroom. It was such a nice surprise at the end of the last book to have a short section of the story written from the perspective of Christian, wow so different, I would read them all over again written this way. I heard E.L. James is writing a fourth book, I hope this is true and I wish she would keep writing about Christian and Ana's life together way past 4 books. It is weird how down I felt when I finished all of the books knowing I would not have that quiet time to sit and read about her characters and get lost in the story so I have started reading all of them again and I am picking up on things i didn't catch the first time through. I am trying out a few new books but they have alot to live up to. I will anxiously await the movie and the new book, if you are not sure about this series give the first book a try and you will be hooked.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|After Hunger Games iwas looking for something good to read and my daughter found it and we both are looking forward to the final book of this trilogy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Now that Fifty and Anastasia have made it this far, I am ready for the next sequel so I can continue my reading. Great!!!
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Yawn!  Couldn't even finish this book! So repetitive!! After the second installment to the series I was very disappointed with this one
0345803485|5.0|I read some of the lower stared reviews. I actually liked the book! There was the use of the same words but I thought she was trying to get across the character. She also used several words that I never use and welcomed the define button just to learn new words for the day. I never watched twilight so did not know there were similarities in the characters. I was hoping for the romantic aspect as well as sexual which she delivered not going over the top. So I was pleased and reading part two now. But I will look up some of the book suggestions that others have suggested to read that are better. At least this has gotten me back interested in reading again shame to say :-)
B008602KQI|5.0|As a big fan of the books I was a bit apprehensive about how the movie had turned out, but was pleasantly suprised.  They did a good job of staying true to the book while making a movie that non readers would also enjoy.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|I love this movie, it was a great follow up to Clash of the Titans, full of action, and great graphics.
B007P3TMW2|2.0|Yes, that is exactly what it was. I did not care at all for this movie and it was way to long and dragged out. Tom Hanks is the only good thing about this film and he was not in it long enough to be bothered watching.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I found myself not being able to put this book down so I could move on to the next one.  It caused me to have a need to know what was going to happen next.
B008602KQI|5.0|Very good acting and the movie although science fiction could be america in the future sad to say but true.  lots of emotional scenes.  wondering if there will be another movie in the future as to what becomes of the two victors from district 12?
B006RUJST6|4.0|This is a good book as it introduces you to the characters.  The second book brought tears to my eyes.....can't wait for her third book!!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Non stop action very hard to put down.a must read.a real love story for generation now.I didn't want it to end.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed the Hunger Games film when I saw it in theatres and loved it all over again when I watched it on blu-ray. I had not read the books when I saw the movie but, after having read the book, I say it is pretty faithful in its recreation. It cuts out some fluff from the book and does a great job of establishing the world.<br /><br />I am very excited for the future films and am very happy to have added this to my blu-ray collection.
B000FC13MM|5.0|This is a wonderful fantasy novel for both juvenile readers and well rounded, mature book enthusiasts. I personally read a lot of fantasy books and the first of the Abhorsen trilogy has an unique world where ancient magic lays on the other side of The Wall in the Old Kingdom, where Sabriel's father has no name, for he is known only as his title, The Abhorsen. Her youth adds a beautiful tone to the epic journey to find her father, all the while grappling with The Dead and learning how to apply the lessons in Charter Magic and from the Book of the Dead as a real necromancer in an old world.
0553801473|4.0|I liked this book better than the two before, but it can get a little too detailed at times. I can't wait until the next book comes out and hope it is as well written as the first book was. Not half bad for a summer read nonetheless.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is just what I needed!  I have the calendar and the ability to add notes.  Using the color codes for the notes, I'm able to categorize my reminders.  I can tell if I need to keep an appointment, run errands, or if it's someone's birthday just by looking at the colors!  Love it!!!
B008764ZQ4|5.0|The music of the 80's was a time of freedom. To listen to the music takes you back when people were free to ROCK!
B000SEGTI0|4.0|My 2 cents. It's no surprise that the book is deeper than the movie (Bladerunner) in characters and overall plot. I liked the whole Mercer story. But the movie is more fun in the andy \\"killing\\" parts. Its a great book and now I want to see the movie again! [[ASIN:B0012PDVQ2 Blade Runner: The Final Cut]]
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very interesting storyline, plus all the extras, (smile). Hope the writer comes up with some new adventure for the Grey's. I will miss Christian.
B0027Z837S|5.0|A very entertaining movie. Funny, great looking movie sets, special effects had me rolling on the floor laughing. Music is good too.
B00005N6RU|5.0|Always watched this movie when it was on tv. Now I can watch it anytime I want. Fast shipment and excellent condition when it arrived.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I use this app daily before going anywhere.  I love the fact I can see hourly data for any change in the weather.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Great after a busy day when you are having a hard time settling down and relaxing. Good to listen to at bedtime.
B008602KQI|3.0|it wasn't one of our favorite movies,butit did get better as it went along. We hope the next one will be better.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|The Jack Reacher books written by Lee Child are always a good read, exciting, thrilling, bit of love interest and this is no different. For me this is the second time I have read this and it is just as good as the first time!  I am re-reading all of Lee Child's books, but this time using the Kindle app on my iPad such a cool way to read and the books will be there for me to re-read if I ever want to!
B00000ILBK|1.0|I watched this movie recently on Netflix and it's easy to tell why it failed.  You've got a franchise premise that enables you to explore new worlds and seek out new life, so what do you do?  The aliens look like humans, the surface of their world looks like Earth.<br /><br />There was an episode of Mystery Science Theater, where the mad scientist provided Joel with a one-word movie review:  \\"Climbing.\\"  I can't tell you the secret recipe for a successful movie, else I would be writing movie scripts instead of Amazon reviews, but I can tell you this much:  If you want your movie to be popular at the box office, don't go overboard on the climbing.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A good quick read. Can't wait to see it as a movie. Will encourage others to read. One of my fave sparks books
B00004R99F|4.0|This is one of my favorite Disney movies and is a staple of my child hood. I was so thankful to find it on Amazon and not only that but it was an affordable price. I was able to order it quickly and it arrived in a timely manner!
B008602KQI|5.0|Amazing.... it was nearly as good as the book! I loved it! totally worth it and a really great deal
B007SGM084|3.0|You can't stop reading the first book. The second one a little less. . .and I'm in the middle of the third one and can't finish it. . .
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I am re-reading all of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels and have started from the first one he wrote, Killing Floor.  It is just as exciting, thrilling and a good read as the first time.  I have been downloading them to the Kindle app on my iPad which is a great and convenient way to read, however I do still like to read a paperback now and again!
B0086700CM|5.0|I went searching on line for a game to play on my Kindle Fire and I noticed a game that had over 100,000 reviews and 4.5 stars (if I remember correctly).  In any event it was enough to make me check it out. I downloaded the game and I tell you the fun began almost immediately.  It actually has a tutorial to show you how the game is played and trust me, if I could catch on to it anybody can.  I have since learned that all ages play this game.  I was playing with a 9 yr old while I was waiting for my car to get serviced at the dealership one day.  I was oblivious to anyone else in the service department.  I was in a Temple Run Zone and all of a sudden I hear this little voice say, \\"Are you playing Temple Run?\\"  I looked up and saw this little girl standing there smiling and asked if she could play. We had the best time.  I am 60 years old.<br /><br />I don't play all that well, but I have the best time trying to get better.  I love all the different things you can buy in the store to enhance your treasure hunt experience.  I have thus far, activated 3 different characters.  It's a blast.  I keep my kindle fire with me at all times now. I have even downloaded it on my phone.  You really get a feel for it if you hook up some headphones to your device.  I get the biggest kick out of all the sounds.  The graphics are good and I love how it lets you know your outcome when you fail.  Great Game....Love It...Absolutely Love It!!!  Oh, did I mention that the app is free....Love It!
B008COD5OO|5.0|An excellent movie for anyone who's ever been 18 years old, chock-full of uncertainty and life. The actors are all amazing unknowns, the dialogue is perfect, and the story is fantastic-- what you think is going to be your typical high school house party story quickly turns into unbelievable, epic chaos and you just can't stop smiling. We LOVED it. Can't wait to see what else this director can do.
B00136NVH4|5.0|Meatloaf is a wonderful singer and entertainer, and this album is filled with a varitey of his hits.The songs are favorites of mine and it's great to listen to while working or doing house work .
B008602KQI|4.0|Orwell's 1984 did not miss the mark by much if you see hints of modern government here. Great movie, somewhat predictable story. I especially liked the human character traits portrayed. The arrogance of the few, the elite, and humility of the exploited. Classic good vs. evil. Big government vs. the populous. The 'educated' vs. the ignorant.<br /><br />Amazon's pricing is not much better than any one else, their delivery is intentionally slow to push you into subscription programs. Maybe a bit like modern government. There is always a choice until you make the wrong one. Interesting how it has to hurt to make the right one. The part that is hard to see is how much it is going to hurt later when the wrong choice is made, the seemingly easy choice.<br /><br />You won't regret this movie or it's quality. Mostly family friendly and a hero to root for!
B003V1WTMM|3.0|Ok book. A little hard to follow at times. And honestly, I didn't become fully excited about it (where I couldn't stop thinking about what was next and when I could pick it up and read some more) until about 75% of the way through the book. Many of the reviews I read before purchasing this book had mentioned the extensive descriptions and the way the author goes on and on about things we really don't need to know for the full effect of the scene she's trying to describe. I have to agree that she goes a bit far. But, back to it being hard to follow....... I feel if I read it again it will shed some light on the hard to follow areas. Overall, the last 10% is the most exciting and makes it worth reading with some nice twists one wouldn't expect.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Definitely a page-turner, however confusing at parts. Climax was overall very sad and dissappointing and not at all the satisfaction I expected.
B00355L2TU|4.0|This workout DVD is amazing great combination of cardio with strength training. Workouts are only 20 mins but I'm always sweating and feeling like I'm getting a great workout in a short time. Great to do in the morning before work!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wonderful book.  It holds your attention to the very end you never know what will happen next. I am now reading for the 3rd. time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a very interesting book, a lot of erotica but has a good story behind it. This book will keep you interested to find out exactly what happened to Chrsitian that made him this way and to see how their love story will play out
B008602KQI|5.0|Beyond amazing! This movie is cutting edge, engaging, awesome, and exciting. I find myself re-reading the books over and over and now I can watch the movie to glimpse the world of Panam once more.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Very good movie!  Pretty good story line!  Good quality film!  Did not have any problems accessing the movie.  Would recommend this movie to others.
B008602KQI|4.0|Its not as good as the book but still a very good movie. Most movies that are made from books aren't as good as the book and while this is true for this movie I still think its better than most other movies made from a book.
B008602KQI|5.0|I truly enjoyed the movie both at the theatre and at home.  Movie was true to most of the facts, but not emphasize the closeness of the heroine and the boy she hunted with befor the Games.  I hope we don't have to wait long for the other two movies which will follow the other two books of the series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is not just about the sex, it is a romance compared to Pretty Woman.  Of course many married people could use the tips found in the book to spice up their own love life.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|great book- love love love- I enjoyed reading the book- it made the movie make more sense- now on book 3!
B008BM9L72|2.0|I love reading. When I get into a book I can't put it down. I always have to finish a book, regardless of good or bad. But I found it really hard to pick my kindle up and actually read this.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|How to Be a Woman was funny in places, however it missed the mark with so many local references that I missed perhaps some of the best humor. Caitlin Moran is a very brave woman to lay her life bare as she did. Cudos to her.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Due to this classic John Wayne film going into the public domain, there has been oodles of subpar versions of McLintock! on home video, most of them in 1.33 pan and scan fullscreen.<br />Well, fans can rejoice as there is now a quality version available thanks to Paramount/Batjac, the Authentic Collector's Edition, and the transfer is from original film elements, and in anamorphic 2.35 Panavision widescreen!<br />The quality of this DVD superb.<br />This release also has some nice extras as well.<br />A western comedy with a stellar all star cast, directed by John Wayne's son, Michael.<br />Very recommended!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|It's a long time since I read a book that was hard to put down. In this day and age of memoirs, a good novel is a luxury. This tale of unfolding self-awareness and the promise of risk taking was well written and completely engaging. I wish that there were more books like this, written in a contemporary time but don't read like a reality t.v. show.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am now reading for the 3rd. time.  Right up to the end you are held captive as to how things will go.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Kind of movies that teach that violence is ok under survival situations is not acceptable for me.<br />this movie exalt not just the violence but the vanity and depression.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|a great book for all ages. the adventures of tom huck and his friends can always be a timely classic. re reading it again brings me back to my youth and reminds me why i enjoy reading so.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very good content and writer is smooth and an easy read. Can't wait to see the movie, hope they do it right.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it!  Couldn't put it down.  Wish there were more books to read about Ana and Christian.  A wonderful romance story!
B00846REIS|4.0|I came across this book by accident and was pleasantly surprised. I really like the characters. I can't wait for next installment.
B00633W614|4.0|This book is well written and very interesting.  However it is somewhat necessary to have first read the first book in this series ONLY TIME WILL TELL.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I heard about this book on NPR and could not wait to get my hands on a copy.  Thank you Amazon for helping me get it quickly.  From the moment I began reading, I was on the road with Harold Fry.  The characters he met along his travels were entertaining, but the real story for me was Harold's self-discovery.  As he moves along, we feel Harold's confidence grow only to be eroded by exhaustion  So many facets to this book, from pain to outright joy.  I have recommended it as a great read to all my book buddies.
B008CXWX4S|5.0|Love this show! Always leaves you wanting more and you can't wait for the next episode. I DVR this show now, but I missed the first five episodes. I was able to get it on Amazon for only a couple bucks and it was well worth it b/c I got caught up on my show and didn't have to feel lost on the 6th episode in. Thanks!!
B005USZML4|4.0|It is a great book but dragged on a little in some spots but I would highly recommend it! :)
B0068LYEHA|4.0|I loved this book! Caitlin is a whiz with words and descriptions. She takes us on her personal journey and peppers her insights with facts from the outside world. More than anything, she throws down the gauntlet to women (and men) about how now is the time for women to rise and take their place alongside men.<br /><br />I read it in 3 days!
B004Q3RMPS|5.0|The only thing terrible about this book is I haven't gotten a chance to try any other recipe after making Tiramisu and Red Velvet cupcakes! That is all anyone ever asks me to make!<br />Very easy recipes, delicious, definately leaves everyone asking for more.
B007712XAU|5.0|Excellent series....discs are very good quality, I highly recommend purchasing these two series. Excellent and exciting story line about an aristocrat family during WW I...
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great book!!! Story was very addictive! Highly recommend to read! Cannot wait until the second part is out!! Recommended in my opinion for a college to young adult age readers
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK! It kept me on the edge of my seat, seriously the whole time. The ending from the first book was so dramatic, that you had to dive right into the second one. There is so much action in this book, you fall in love with the characters even more!
B0086DBE62|5.0|Fun to watch. A family movie. Close to the original with some up dated imagination. Would recomend if looking for something for the family to sit down and enjoy together.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Great movie, wonderful story! Gives you another perspective to look at and some insight into autism. I would definitely reccomend it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Ive tried a lot of these apps and this is the best one Ive found so far. Its easy to use and doesnt have ads. That is a big plus for me. I love the lock and share feature!
B001LM1456|4.0|Me and the kids really liked this original movie. I would really like too see a new one released since the avengers just came out
B004TI5N38|5.0|I very much enjoyed the read. Baldacci is one  of my favourite authors. Story builds, tension rises to the finale.  Looking forward to his next book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I could not put it down! This was probably my favorite book out of the whole trilogy; it kept you wanting to read so much more!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I was ecstatic to see a new book by this author! He is one of my favorites. This book does not disappoint... keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride. It also gives you some things to ponder about our world when you are done reading.... Enjoy!
B00866H7SS|5.0|Bared to you was excellent. I read the 3 books of Fifty Shades of Grey and I thought Bared to You was as good or even better
B007KOLNXC|5.0|Mad men continues to perform at an amazing level each season. The complexities and superb plot points leaves you asking for more and more. This show will get you hooked. No wonder this shoe has earned multiple awards.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|the movie lockout was very different and creative, I work in a real jail for a living so for me it was a concept I could appreciate for the future of corrections.
B004J64QSI|5.0|The singing was amazing. I will have to watch the original to compare them, but I definitely give this one a thumbs up.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|Amazing, funny, bittersweet indie. Really makes you think about relationships & romance in general. When I watched this movie the first 2 times, I HATED Zooey Dechanel WITH A PASSION. Like, I hated her so much that I boycotted any of her products. The more I watch it, the more I can tolerate her character in 500. I hated what she \\"did\\" to Tom in the movie, but I think, now, that it was both of their faults for not being communicative. This film is SERIOUSLY worth it's weight in gold. You won't be disappointed.
B001GGZJ08|5.0|This Mp3 album sounds great sonically. Thought i was listening to a vinyl record. Amazons Mp3 store is a great download feature. Good price and fast download. Can put on my phone as well as the cloud. I've compared this purchase to a Cd bought from a store. Not much difference. A must have.
B003B02O14|5.0|As always,  John Grisham comes through with a riveting book that you don't want to put down.  There's always a lot of the law and justice, and, of course, a little humor along the way.  John Grisham is my favorite author, but then I may be a little prejudiced....I lived in the same town as he and went to the same church when we were kids, and now I go to church with his dad.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was different than I expected, and that is what made it even better than the previous one.  You will be surprised with the twists and turn taken in this volume.
B007SGM084|5.0|Brilliant trilogy! Excellent read, can't think of anything that even compared to these books! A must read, and reread, and reread!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie and Christian Bale. It was very good audio and picture. My family like it too.
B0014EU5XI|5.0|This is a great compilation album. What more can you ask?  The remastered cuts are great. Pretty much a definitive album!
B008602KQI|5.0|Had saw the movie in the theater and then now have watched it three times since I got the DVD. It's great!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman The Complete Series is the only way to buy DQMD. It has every episode, bonus features, and the movies included. You can enjoy Dr. Quinn all day every day, forever! GREAT DEAL! Amazon has it the cheapest on the internet. I had it in under 5 days, with regular shipping. Amazon and Dr. Mike always deliver. :)
B00846REIS|3.0|I enjoyed it and it kept my interest.  I didn't end up with huge anticipation for the next book in the series but I am interested enough to read it when it comes out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app.  So easy to look up so many fun and exciting things to make, bake or just read.  Highly recommend this to everyone who is crafty, loves to cook or just likes looking through interesting topics.
B008602KQI|3.0|Good movie but book was so much better.  I understand movie had to be condensed from book but, in my opinion, there was more chemistry shown between character as portrayed in the book than in the movie.
B008FOB124|5.0|It's hard to believe it's been 16 years since Dead Can Dance's last album \\"Spirit Chaser\\" was released. That album had a great sound--african, aboriginal, didgerdidoo and a pulsating rhythm that I'd hoped would appear on Anastasis. While it took me a few listens to groove to the new release and it's mix of Middle-Eastern and Scottish flavors, I really have come to love it! The deceptively simple song structures have a great mix of load percussion and beats that meld beautifully with Lisa Gerard's and Brendan Perry's vocal stylings. Dead Can Dance has a unique sound no matter what! Highly recommended for music for films, long car rides, or just tuning in or zoning out!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was better than the first book, and so far, better than the third.  I am about half way through the third.  I have enjoyed the series, and to be honest, wasn't going to read it but was talked in to it by my sister and sister-in-law while I was on vacation.  I'm glad they did.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|For a while I was wondering what should I get as my first Kinlde book. I got The Hunger Games!<br />It is an amazing book! I couldn't stop reading.<br />Worth the money and the time :)<br />I don't plan to write a long review because I think everything has been said.<br />If you are interested in this type of books get it, if you are not - don't.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Very Disappointed after first three. Lacked cohesion,not looking forward to Number 5. Number 6 Had better be awesome or I'm not buying
B004Q7DQLS|3.0|I'm always up for a new series, and throwing...well...\\"elder races\\" into the mix sounded right up my alley.  That's just asking for a rich fantasy world with endless possibilities and creatures.<br /><br />Pia Giovanni is a nomadic human/Wyr hybrid who tries to stay under the radar and out of trouble when it comes to Wyrkind and their Dark Fae enemies. However, she is forced to steal a special item from Dragos Cuelebre, the most powerful and short-tempered Wyr there is.  She manages to be successful, but that only makes her public enemy number one to him, until they meet and sparks *really* fly.<br /><br />The novel actually starts off promising. We're introduced to a number of creatures and get a taste of the delicate balance of respect and deep rivalries that exist among the different species.  The tension starts out high between Pia and Dragos and it's very entertaining. I was invested in their teamwork when they ended up in enemy territory.<br /><br />However, being primarily PNR that can only last for so long until they shag like bunnies. If I do PNR, I am not for the super sappy kind and that's what it morphs into more and more as the book progresses. The ending was eye-roll inducing for me because I just felt as if too much happens between them within a span of days that I could count with two hands.<br /><br />The nicknames for the characters were pretty corny too; so much so that I wish Harrison didn't even bother to add them.<br /><br />I also had an issue with the writing format of the book.  It alternates between third-person and first-person; however the first-person inner monologues are supposed to be italicized. There were countless spots where they were not italicized, making it a little confusing and annoying to follow at times.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I will continue with this series because the couple (which I ended up not liking) overshadows the world itself, which I found way more interesting. For a PNR, that's honestly how it should be in the first place. But their love story just wasn't complicated enough for me to appreciate the journey. They just didn't earn it for me.e first place. But their love story just wasn't complicated enough for me to appreciate the journey. They just didn't earn it for me.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|This book was not what I was expecting, but I LOVED it.  It was so well written and it was laugh-out loud funny at times in spite of the fact one of the underlying themes is death.<br /><br />I fell in love with the characters immediately, it was impossible not to.  Their deep philosophical thinking and no-holds barred honesty was liberating; at times their thoughts were astounding because of their ages, but in light of their experiences, completely understandable.<br /><br />I look forward to reading other stories by John Green and highly recommend this book :)
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|This movie was very disappointing.  It was slow moving and dull.  We kept waiting for more action and a better story line.  Others saw it and thought it was good, but no one said it was great.  I would not recommend it.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Enjoyed the read - great action! You have to wonder if this kind of thing really happens in D.C..  The major characters are very unusual and makes the reader want to see them succeed.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This series really loses its' luster by the start of the 3rd book and never quite recovers. Still, I'd say it's worth reading if only to find out how Christian and Anastasia's escapades wrap up.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|what is this? I cant even figure out what this movie is about. No one in the movie is likeable, the guy who plays John Carter is a block of wood
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. Use it almost everyday. Cant figure out how to edit my board names on my kindle. Otherwise everything about it is awesome. I'm in love!
B008602KQI|5.0|The Movie was great in the theaters and even better on Blu-Ray. You will hunger for more Hunger Games after watching this movie. You will find yourself cheering on Katniss and Peeta as they struggle for survival in a modern day \\"Roman arena\\".
0316044695|5.0|I really felt the emotion in this story. Marcus did what every \\"Elite\\" Operator would do, he pushed the hero label away from himself and onto his fellow brothers. He told the story and lets the reader follow easily but I did sensed the survivor guilt throughout which has to be tough for him to deal with on a daily basis.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|This is the best book of the series. You have to read this book. I only wish point blank was better
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You may think whatever you like, this book makes people discuss about it for a long period of time. That is what a good book does.
B0026O475M|5.0|One of our all time favorites.  It is a great family movie.  Love to repeat the phrase \\"Wilson\\" when we lose something...\\"come back, I am sorry\\".
B002TU1Q3Y|4.0|This is a good yarn well told by an excellent story teller. Deighton embeds the parallel themes in the novel in a matrix of solid facts that can only have emerged as a result of diligent, multi-facetted research of the circumstances of the war in the air in the 1940s between Britain and Germany. A relatively sympathetic and understanding treatment of the respective experiences of two of the principal belligerents in the massive conflict that was WWII.
B008M34INW|3.0|We had a lot of trouble with the download,with alot of interruptions and having to wait until later until we could resume watching the movie. I don't know what the problem was, high volume or what.
B004YXE438|5.0|I wish I could get more of their puzzles. its a good time waster. other than that I love it!
B004F27I3Q|5.0|the influence of Sabbath lives on,in this killer disc.awesome heavy guitar riffing and ozzy-like vocals.slow to moderate tempo,doomy lyrics,production and sound quality A-1.real nice CD booklet.disc is solid start to finnish.if you are a fan of doom metal,you gotta get this.I would also recommend Celestial Hi-Fi by Sheavy,Sleeps Holy Mountain,and Destruction of the Void and High On Infinity by Count Raven.Rock On!
B006LSZECO|1.0|When I finished this book, I was so angry that I wasted my time reading a story about 2 people with absolutely no redeeming qualities. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!
B008602KQI|3.0|I REALLY EXPECTED MORE.  THE BEGINNING WAS SLOW AND FINALLY SOME ACTION.  NEXT TIME I'LL RENT BEFORE MAKING A PURCHASE FOR MY COLLECTION.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|First off, it surely could have been worse. But having said that, it's official; Rush is dead. They could not write a memorable tune if their lives depended on it. These songs, like all the others since at least Counterparts, are utterly forgettable. I can hardly recall or hum along with any of these songs. A massive wall of blandness stretched out to six minutes or so.<br /><br />What was the name of that song? I don't know can't remember. How does it go? I wouldn't even begin to know how to hum it. Where are the hooks? Obviously on a permanent fishing vacation.<br /><br />The drums are totally inaudible. I put my ear phones on and I can hear light tapping way down in the mix. Just as a test, I put on some Rick Rubin produced Slayer (Dave Lombardo is the Neil Peart of thrash metal)and the drum sound just hits you like a brick coming out of the stereo. I'm not comparing the styles of these two bands, but I am comparing the production and/or mastering; well, there is really no comparison.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels sounds like a third generation dubbed cassette passed down to a friend of a friend of a friend...Oh and for God's sake, tell Geddy's producer(s) to stop layering vocals over vocals. Geddy is not Brian Wilson and these last batches of albums are not Pet Sounds. Since Vapor Trails, this vocal layering has gotten way out of control.<br /><br />I'm editing this review 11/20/12. I just listened to the digital version of the album: [...]<br /><br />The drums are much more prominent and upfront in the mix; not like the tin-can sound on the CD. The production is so much better as well and not so muddy.<br /><br />The songs aren't really that great but this is much better than the CD. I'm still not sure why they would let an inferior product be put out on CD and charge $12.00+ for it. Luckily I bought used...<br /><br />Updated 12/26/13. I originally gave this album 2 stars and decried how bad it was. I've been listening to it again for about 3 straight days and have concluded that my original review is totally off base. I can admit when I'm wrong and boy was I wrong. Sure it does not compare to the classics, but it's a pretty fine record. I give it 3 1/2 to 4 stars.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Was very excited to read this prequel. Loved the Maze Runner Trilogy and The Kill Order is another great read into the series. Highly recommend if you read the Trilogy.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is one of those perfect storm apps. It's simple, but pretty, and fun but challenging game play. There's no reason not to get this app, especially now that it's the FAotD.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is ok.  It's definitely not all it's been hyped up to be.  It leaves you hanging at the end so you will by the second book.  The writing isn't all that great so if you are a stickler for grammer, you should know going in, it isn't written well.  \\"It isn't smutty enough for as badly as it is written.\\"
B000NI8F5G|5.0|it never gets old, always puts a smile on your face and it's actually a masterful piece of meta cinema, too. Far more than merely 'feel good'
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy is absolutely amazing with twists and turns in every chapter! You will not be able to put it down once you start!
B008EL4YX6|3.0|For free it wasn't so bad... but after the first 10-15 levels it just got boring. Wouldn't pay cash for it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is just the escape every woman needs from everyday life. It's exciting and dangerous but also romantic. I'm just starting book II.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It's classic Stephen King without the gore.  Fantastic Historical Sci FI Fiction.  Could be my favorite King book ever.<br />A great read.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Dexter (any season, but including Season 6) is some of the best written content I have yet to watch.  We do not subscribe to HBO, but rather just buy this season via Amazon Prime.  We watch over PS3, and LOVE this electronic version of watching.  Dexter is dark, but so well written you will easily realize that by the end of the season, you CANNOT wait for the next.  If we're able to buy Season 7, episode by episode, on Amazon Prime ... we'll be doing so.  Dexter also is very adult content ... not for a younger viewer.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I love a good fantasy book and this one fit the bill!  There are twists and turns that take you to unexpected places. I felt all ranges of emotions while reading, from sadness to fear and suprise.  The author makes up her own world with vampires, witches and deamons all intermingling with humans. She writes in great detail.  I was happy to be a part of her world for a while!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Sherlock is the best TV show currently on the air. BBC and Stephen Moffat have joined together and made a genius adaptation of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Amazing!!!!!!
B008LY5VHE|5.0|Most people have seen Jaws and know the story, so what I'm reviewing is the 'quality' of the Blu-ray edition.  I was really happy to see such a fantastic job of the production team to clean up the picture for HD.  The visuals are stunning - much better then on the standard DVD.  I was also really impressed with the quality of the 7.1 sound.  Every small sound was heard and crystal clear.<br />The only criticism is that I'm tired of purchasing Blu-ray movies and being forced to buy the DVD version in the same package.  I already have 2 copies of Jaws, so another doesn't make sense.  I would assume that most people purchasing Blu-ray versions of classic movies probably have the movie on DVD.  I wish we had the choice to purchase just the Blu-ray copy.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I did not like this book at all and was actually excited about seeing the movie, until I read it.  Now, I don't even want to see it. I disliked the format of it being written as diary-type entries, the topics jumping around and the nature of the topics. It's not often that I find a book I really dislike, but this is definitely one I would not recommend.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I have to say that the first 2 books in this series were very good. They were written well enough, but the subject is what really captures your attention and your imagination. I especially liked the 2nd book, Catching Fire, because it felt like it was setting up for a very interesting finish...<br /><br />...and that's where the series takes a turn for the worse. The final book, Mockingjay, had so much potential. But it failed in so many ways. It was as if the author was rushed into putting a complete story together. The author spends an excruciating amount of time turning the main character from a strong-willed survivalist caretaker into a weepy, mopey, whiny teenage brat. Yet somehow, through all her whining, the other characters hardly seem to notice the change in her.<br /><br />Within that context, the majority of Mockingjay is spent diving into the minutia of the main character's feelings for various characters in the book. But whenever the author finally broaches what SHOULD be the main focus of this final book, she glosses over it with a brief paragraph or two having some character explaining to the main character that it is now months later and all these momentous events happen. But apparently they're not momentous enough to spend any time exploring their significance...no the primary focus is the emotions of a teenager.<br /><br />Finally, as the 3rd book comes to a close, it takes some very weird turns and starts to stray into the territory of ridiculous. Then to top it off, because the author has spent so little time developing the plot and wasted so much time on the emotions of the main character, the ending makes very little sense. I think I understand what the author was TRYING to state through the main character's actions, but it's hard to know for sure when very little of an actual plot was explored in this book.<br /><br />Anyway...should you read it? Yeah, it's worth a read. I think that the author explored oppressiveness in a unique way. It certainly captures the imagination for a while. And while I suggest that you read the final book just so that you know what happens, I suggest that you do so with significantly lowered expectations.inly captures the imagination for a while. And while I suggest that you read the final book just so that you know what happens, I suggest that you do so with significantly lowered expectations.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I love Phillipa Gregory's books and this one is no different.  She has a way of drawing you in to the story. Wonderful author and great book
B00785P2QC|4.0|title says it all. not really sure what else needs to be said.  I don't care for boggling my fb with the post needed to get goals ornpoints.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This one still had a lot of sex but not as much as the first and had a better plot.  Just started the third book and looking forward to what happens.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|As a writer myself (ROZ: The Story of a Jamaican Lolita)there is much of Hemingway in my work.  Anyone who has written after him has his legacy.  This book--it's about humanity, love, war, life, death, and what is especially great is that, unlike James Joyce, we can read it.[[ASIN:1461102979 Roz:  The Story of a Jamaican Lolita]]
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the books and was a little worried when i heard Gary Ross was to be the director. I wasn't sure he was the best choice to direct this movie even though i have enjoyed his other films. But he did a great job with The Hunger Games. He handled the violent scenes cleverly, so they didn't loose their impact but didn't give way to violent gore, especially as my 12 year old wanted to see it. The casting is superb and the vision of The Capital totally realistic.  Susan Watts
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Interesting(ish) story but the writing is pretty stinky.  Very little character development, lots and lots and lots and lots (you get the idea) of f@#&ing fluff (excuse the pun) that really adds nothing to the story. Eh.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|With my nice 7.1 home theater, this turned out to sound better than that of the theater! The clarity of the video is outstanding naturally being 1080p. Movie is pretty good too.
B0012BX062|5.0|One of the best hip hop albums of all time. I have bought this album a few times since it came out when I was in high school. It is great that Amazon is offering it was such a deal, had to add to my digital collection.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book was recommended to me and so far have not been able to put it down. If you enjoy magic and fantasy this is the book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I downloaded this game for my son. he hasn't had a chance to play yet because I can't stop playing.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|An intriguing drama that builds up to an exciting climax.<br />I viewed this on my laptop and was impressed with the video quality. I did not encounter any buffering issues.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Like I said in my other 2 reviews, the story line of the trilogy is an interesting one.  Who doesn't love a good love story, especially with some hot sauce thrown in?!  Unfortunately the writing is dull, uninspired, and repetitive.  Repetitive.  Repetitive.  Repetitive.  Did I mention that it was repetitive?  Could have been so much better.  sigh...
B008M34INW|4.0|great flick! loved it. sure to be an Amazon favorite,one of Mel Gibsons more exotic movies and sure to become a a popular motion picture of his many fans.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This show is worth taking the time to watch.  The writers can keep this story going and I would recommend it to anyway, but make sure you start from Season 1 or you might miss some things.
B00101ZOTA|3.0|This is an an entertaining, well acted and directed movie except the twist at the end tells you that everything you have seen is a concoction of one of the characters.  This reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Stage Fright\\" in which the story related in flashback form by Richard Todd to Jane Wyman turns out to be a lie.  This left audiences dissatistifed because they don't like being lied to since they tend to accept the device of the flashback as being the truth.<br /><br />But \\"The Ususal Suspects\\" somehow gets away with it, probably because it is simply a better picture than \\"Stage Fright.\\"
B006LSZECO|4.0|A fun and quick read with lots of twists. I would recommend it. It is our book club selection this month.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This was such a good book.  I really enjoyed it.  I put off reading it for years - I think mainly because of the title.  It just didn't sound appealing to me.  As it turns out, it was a great book and I'm glad I read it.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|But still not great.  It is a good idea for a story line, but the execution just doesn't cut it.  She uses the same wording over and over and over...  Ever heard of a thesaurus?  Yet, she throws in all of these big words that no 22yo new college grad runs around using, no matter how bright they are.  Guessing it's an attempt to take the focus away from the poor writing quality.  She has 2 or 3 sex scenes that she just recycles (and recycles and recycles...) throughout all 3 of the books.  Again, the real story in book 2 could have been condensed into about 150-200 pages.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The app is easy to use and the numbers are easy to see.  It's also convenient because it's right on my Kindle.  I like it, it works for me.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I started watching Season 1 on my Kindle Fire and I was hooked and now I'm caught up to Season 5 and I can't wait for each week to come so I can watch the next episode...only recommendation is to start watching from Season 1 or you may miss stuff.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|While many of the technologies have changed, the ideas and approaches this book talks about are just as important now as they ever were.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought it was really good, I liked how they introduced different characters and the different emotions the 2 Main characters develop. totally recommend it and cant wait till book 3
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Seems like she just goes through the book with a thesaurus and changes words that don't need to be changed. Still erotic though.
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|A movie to keep you inspired to follow your heart.  I never tire of this movie.  Motivating, and refreshing.  A keeper!
B008476HBM|5.0|My daughter and I both read this book. She really enjoyed it, more than the movie. I also enjoyed the book, very much.
0345803485|3.0|This is not a book that will win any literary awards. The writing is average and repetitious and I strongly agree with the critical reviewers who express irritation about the frequent references to Ana's subconscious and inner goddess because that was truly annoying. However, it was a page-turner and I couldn't put it down. Strip away any expectations and just enjoy it for what it is...an entertaining book to escape to and something other than work and family to think about.<br /><br />BTW, if they choose Ryan Gosling to play Christian Grey I will NOT see the movie.
B002VXGW2E|3.0|I found myself wanting to fast-forward through all the modern day parts so that I could watch Meryl Streep's brilliant performance.  Amy Adams is a solid actress, but the character is incredibly difficult to like.  She is written in as a whiny, narcissistic bitch.  When contrasted with Streep's warm, humanizing interpretation of Child, you end up hating the one and loving the other.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this Trilogy! I am not a serious reader, but finished this book in two days because I loved it so much.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I haven't purchased a Cd from Linkin Park in the past but have liked an occasional song or two.  Then, Living Things was released so I decided to purchase the entire set of songs.  Wow is all I can say.  For me, it was the perfect combination of \\"hard driving\\" and \\"melodic\\".  I would recommend this to anyone!
B0058VW36U|4.0|the updates are VERY slow and I'm a bit tired of waiting for them... If I pay for a game, I'd like to see an update more often. knowing that they're creating more games to buy (Experiments) is VERY annoying!
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  One of the best of this past year.  Good plot line.  Fair amount of violence, but great story.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have this running on my Kindle Fire almost all the time. (Does sleeping count) It is an amazing app, glad I was shown by a friend about it!
B008602KQI|5.0|The future is the past in this Movie, only the Arena has been replaced by open space, and the gladiators are much younger. Amazingly the suggestion of a Socialist regime running work communities under militaristic control is something many are fearing today as an ultimate result of elitist power grabs. This theatrical presentation provides the viewer with the ever present specter of Hope as shown in the reaction of mine workers, to the triumphant raising of a victorious hand signal. if the series of books of which there are three continues in Movie production, they will be received by appreciative audiences as was this one.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|After a long hiatus, DCD return with a stellar release! Lush sounds and production, perfect musicianship, and possibly the best songwriting DCD has done to date. Timeless music from DCD!
B006TVQU6C|4.0|The supplied 3.5\\" drive rails in the case don't work with Western Digital (WD) drives. I bought a 2TB WD Green drive and the screw slots don't match.<br /><br />Just thought I'd make you aware.<br /><br />If you do an online search you'd find more people with the same problem.
B0019I6WDG|1.0|Awful movie...glamorizes teen pregnancy, it's crude and distasteful.  Don't waste your time watching it.  I'm sorry I did and will not recommend it.
B0039PPW60|2.0|Recently  bought this Behringer product after reading so many good reviews. ON THE the first day that I connect it when you enable usb interface makes a rare sound, I disconnect from the computer to see if it was a problem with the cable and connect the main output to my Tascam-US-200...But yeah still did it! So I only connected Tascam-US-200 to my PC with no mixer and it was gone. My determination is that the interface of this Mixer is not of very good quality... something which I do not understand, because I have 2 Behringer interface,UCA202 & U UCA222 I use them for my online radio and they work perfectly well.That is the reason why I gave it  a poor review, I personal think that this is one of the reasons why people wants to buy this mixer.  Also I did more research and found another person with similar a problem<br />, so my recommendation is do not buy if you want to use the USB in my case I better use an external USB Interface instead BUT IN OTHER MIXER....<br />[[ASIN:B000Z7567A Yamaha MG82CX 8 Input Stereo Mixer with Digital Effects]]<br />[...]
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well written, as it keeps your interest. Very erotic. Hope that this author writes more that are like this. Love the love story part of it.
B005HE5J7I|4.0|Had already read \\"Sarum\\" which kept me enthralled thru all of its 800+ pages. This one is very much like it, a fascinating view of the 'growing pains' that resulted in the London of today. I read \\"London\\" less as a novel than as a history book that gives the human detail often missing from the usual histories.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Phillipa Gregory does it again!  Taking a look at British history during a period that I'm interested in, she gives accurate historical background along with a sympathetic voice for the people involved.
B007NUP6GS|5.0|This is quite simply the very best performance and recording one can imagine, of course based on precious, brilliant material. Fresh, energetic, gloriously sung with extraordinary discipline and vision. Could not be better!<br /><br />And for a real bonus, the notes contributed by Sir John are a very enjoyable and deeply informative (and felt) read. Thank you, Sir.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Little spoil alert! If you want a Happy story this will not be. The characters are well written and it's hard to remind yourself it's just a story.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Use to work on my Droid, no longer. Never worked on my kindle fire. Useless app. Kinda like a lib. Alot of hype but deflates fast.
B00846REIS|5.0|5 star romance. I loved every word. A great love story and beautiful characters. Great read after fifty shades :)
B000V8A95C|5.0|I loved the broadway show. It's so fun to listen to the songs again. If you loved Wicked you will love this !
B006LSZECO|2.0|The characters in this book are not real.  I didn't like either of them from the start and it turned out that I was right. I got so tired of the constant tension and  prolonged plot twists that I just read ahead and found out what happened. I did finish it, but then again an unbelievable ending. \\"Ugh\\" was the word that came to mind after I finished.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read it after most of my friends had already read it.  So maybe the \\"erotica\\" would have been worse had I read it before I heard so much about it.  More than the sex I think this story was about the stereotypical view that all women want to fix men.  Bad men especially.  I'm glad I read it and look forward to how the movie comes out.  There are a few scenes that will be tricky and keep an R rating.
B008602KQI|4.0|If you have read the series, you may find the film lacking in depth, etc., but you will have a better understanding of what is going on.  For those who have not read the books, this is a fun, well directed and produced film that will keep your attention from start to finish.
B008602KQI|5.0|Although pretty true to the book, I am really glad I read the book<br />as I would have missed so much detail. True of all book to movie<br />conversions, but this was better that most.
B00425S1H8|5.0|This + console cable + Cisco Catalyst 2950 + Win7 Laptop = no issues. I was able to console into the switch using TeraTerm. I really have little idea what I'm doing. I'm going through a CCNA course, so it was my first time consoling into a switch. If I can do it, anyone should be able to handle it. The converter cable does exactly what it says it will do, as long as you install the drivers.

B0031RS4UM|5.0|I am now hooked on Lee Child's ongoing Reacher travels- going to read them in order. What's next for Reacher? Can't wait to find out :)
B001D09OAI|4.0|My son had to get glasses and was a bit embarassed about it, till I showed him this movie and how cool Charlie Sheen as Wild Thing is.  What a fun movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Game is a good way to occupy your mind without the stress of a rapid fire game.  The game starts out easy and gets you hooked then it becomes increasingly more difficult while keeping you hooked.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|This game is fun from the very start. Definitely recommend it.<br />The controls are really easy and the graphics look great. Give it a try!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love reading on my Kindle, and have been devouring books since I purchased it.  I absolutely loved the Hunger Games trilogy, an action-packed read with just enough of a love story to keep you in suspense about the outcome.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was a page-turner from beginning to end.  I could not put it down.  I loved it.  It was just as good as the first book.  I highly recommned this book.
B008LXZEYU|5.0|Love this movie can't wait for the second one! Will is usually very funny but in this one he is better then ever, worth every penny to watch
B008D1LVRY|4.0|Some good songs on this album. Debut album is still my favorite. This is a better album than stampede in my opinion.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Beautiful Disaster is a very good read.  The characters are likeable, the story line flows and it's well written.  Jamie McGuire was able to get you thinking about the personalities of the characters and make you think about them once you put the book down.  I look forward to the sequel \\"Walking Disaster\\".
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have not had any issues with Pinterest in Kindle.  It works better on Kindle than on my computer....I LOVE IT!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This is a great movie especially if you haven't read the books. But I do feel they left out an important part on how Katniss acquired the mockingjay pin. The history and meaning behind it was attached to so many other important parts of the complete story. I would still recommend it though!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two was just as good as the first book.  This is a wonderful triology.  I highly recommend it!  This was such a page-turner.
B00400NHRO|5.0|Great story, hard to put down. Highlights some daily struggles associated with the medical profession. Overall a classic book I would recommend.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This movie is awesome. Batman begins tells the origin story of batman in the way only Christoper Nolan could give us. I absolutely loved the characterization of such Batman villains such as Ras al Ghul and Scarecrow. When I first watched this movie I didnt like it because it was so different from the comics but after watching it a few times I really grew to love this movie. If your a batman fan of any kind you will adore this movie.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|We watch anything with Ewan McGregor in it.  Not a great movie, and a little disjointed, but overall it was entertaining and enjoyable.
B007HJA5IO|5.0|Love this series, every episode is great to watch. Great series from HBO. Can't wait for season two to come out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so happy they created an app for the kindle fire! I was using the site but it regularly froze my kindle up &amp; I would have to wait on it to die &amp; recharge it to fix the issue. I have had no problems with the app including the ones I had using the mobile site.
B008602KQI|5.0|I have read the Hunger Games Trilogy, and had my doubts about their ability to bring Hunger Games to the screen. However, it met all of my expectations and I was thoroughly entertained.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|Never really heard of Gotye or heard his music.  Heard a song on the radio I thought was pretty cool so figured I'd check it out.  Not bad at all.  Kinda a modern folk sound.... not really pop, not really rock, not really folk.... but kinda in between the 3.  It doesn't sound like everyone else out there like alot of music does these days.  if you wanna hear something a little different from the norm and like mellow style listening give a shot.  I think it's pretty good stuff.
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|I saw this movie years ago, and it is just as enjoyable watching it again as when it first was released.  Robert Redford and Mia Farrow were great in this one.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that, as in the IRON MAN movies, you come away from it thinking \\"That's the role he was born to play.\\" Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent job of reinventing the character of Sherlock Holmes, transforming the slim, intellectual Basil Rathbone character into a more muscular, brawling (and obnoxious) fellow who still shines at cracking the mysteries nobody else can with flawless logic and encyclopedic knowledge. Perhaps the worst thing about the movie is Holmes being eclipsed by Rachel McAdams' Irene Adler in the second part of the movie only to have her ollapse into a \\"damsel in distress\\" at the end. Other than that, the movie is an excellent thriller which manages to keep you guessing right up until Holmes reveals the details of the nefarious plot and sets out to stop it cold. Kudos also for Jude Law, whose Watson is most excellent; Mark Strong, whose evil Lord Blackwood projects insane (yet coldly calculating) menace from beginning to end; and Eddie Marsan as the long-suffering Inspector Lestrade. Well worth multiple viewings!
B007HJB55G|5.0|Every episode is worth watching in this series. It tells like the books it is based on so don't miss an episode. Great acting and great design. Thuroughly enjoyed every minute.
B005DJRD80|3.0|A quick, quirky pilot introduces fun characters and dilemmas against the alarming modern background of the way young girls will debase themselves for the attention of hot guys.  The acting's topnotch and the story very involving because we recognize a strong, smart girl, pretty but not overwhelmingly hot, as she negotiates an early crush and tries to enter the world of sexually liberated women.  Later episodes however seem to rely less on moving the story forward and focus more on the characters as they posture for nothing but comic effect.  The show loses its soul a bit and the characters (example, the bossy, fat cheerleader) who were once refreshing and real, now descend into types with no shading at all to their personalities.  The genre moves from comedy-drama to pure sitcom.  A real disappointment after the promise of the pilot.
B000FBJFSC|2.0|It is probably the most depressing book I've ever read.  If you're down in the dumps to begin with - don't read this book.<br />My mother grew up in an Irish family.  Her mother had to live with her maiden sister, who helped to raise my mother and her two brothers due to a father that spent most of his time away from family and reciting poetry in bars for a drink.  He only showed upon occasionally to give everyone a beating and then be gone again.<br />From what I've been told, my grandmother would go to the rectory to ask for an annulment, only to be refused.<br />I never knew that my grandfather was alive until he died when I was in the third grade.<br />Maybe it was too close to home.
B004XISI4A|4.0|Knowing my interest in future fiction my daughter bought me the first four books and my wife Pamela the fifth one. For this I owe them big time. The debate may rage about how good a writer Gearge RR Martin is in the classic sense but I submit he is a world class storyteller. The series is a complex, superbly constructed tale spanning multiple generations and characters showcasing a vivid imagination and exceptional craft. Long may he continue. Peter.
B007SGM084|3.0|The books are too redundant and poorly written. I think the only reason it made the best sellers list is because of the sex contained in the story.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Too much sex.  I enjoy what is happening in the story, some of the sex could be eliminated.  The punishment by sex is not for me.  I hope by the end of the story, Christian grows up.
B0085LMFAE|5.0|I get happy feet and joyous heart every time I hear this music.  I had forgotten the layers of controversy surrounding this album and it just bolstered my appreciation for Simon's collaboration.  This album opened my soul to Africa and I remain forever grateful.  I just regret that I didn't get a chance to attend the concert.
B008602KQI|1.0|I almost stopped watching the movie. First of all, it was shocking to see that the theme of punishment from previous rebellious sectors was carried on from one generation onto innocent subsequent generations. And then when twelve years olds were being slaughtered, I was shocked. The hair, makeup and costumes of the establishment were ridiculous. The idea that people would watch children fighting for their lives on teleivision was nauseating. I would not recommend at all. It was terrible!!!
1609611543|5.0|This is a great book not just to lose weight but to learn to be healthy.<br />This book will teach you about the bad foods you eat everyday and how to change eating habits and start to feel better
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense. I couldn't stop reading once I started. I sympathized with both main characters. I laughed and felt sad at different times while reading. Great read but I did not like the ending.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wonderful story once you get used to all the sex. The more you read the more you want to know what past has lead this man to be the way that he is....
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Can't believe this app is free for users on other devices, but yet they want to charge Kindle users. What a joke! I will not be buying another Kindle for these reasons (this seems to happen a lot!).
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Could not put it down. Much better then the first!  Can't wait to get to the last book! Full of suspense.
B0065AVWGU|5.0|the way frank miller made this movie was like a 1950's crime novel. mostly in black and white with splashes of color! the three storys intertwine with each other! thhis is a must have in either DVD on on the Kindle.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|the final installment of the amazing trilogy is a must-read - more thrills, suspense, drama and gut-clenching scenes! too bad we can't have any more thrilling stories from the author...
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I've heard so much about this trilogy.... But I find it boring and not interesting. Sorry but it was a delusion.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love the books. Better than the movie. A real page Turner. Would definitely be interested in other works from this author.
B0086700CM|2.0|I didn't like it.  It's very hard for me to get the guy moving right and staying there - tends to pull to the left.  Certainly wouldn't buy it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, but this book got my attention! I had to see what all the hype was about. Took me a few weeks to read all 3 books. I hope another one is published!
B008602KQI|4.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and wanted my own copy, especially with the advertised extras.  Unfortunately, the movie disk was damaged: it froze, wouldn't eject from my DVD player and almost ruined it.  I am waiting for a replacement.<br /><br />I've always had one observation about the books, and now this movie.  This is a story in which teenagers duel to the death, for the most part against their will, for the amusement of the viewing audience.  How this story can be classified as Young Adult is beyond me.  I guess the powers that be who decide these things are only on the lookout for sex, nudity or swearing.  Even with the artful cuts, this is a violent movie based on a violent book.<br /><br />That being said, as far as the movie goes, having read the books, it was very interesting to change the POV from Katniss to an observer.  (Spoiler alert!) I missed the character of Madge, especially since she is important in Catching Fire, but my criticisms are nit-picky.  The casting for Katniss, Gale and Peeta (and not forgetting Rue) is spot on.  Definitely worth while and I'm looking forward to Catching Fire in November 2013.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|This calendar is the first one I have found that will work with the MSN and outlook calandars.It is easy to use and works as advertised.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was so good I couldn't put it down. I wanted to get the next one right away. The story line just keeps you gluded to your kindle until the battery goes and you have to plug it in to keep reading.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The writing in the this trilogy is fair and the content is beyond believable (and becomes more unbelievable as the stories go on).  With that said, the steamy and fantasy like content is fun to read.  Overall, it's enjoyable and I was glad to have read it.
B008602KQI|1.0|Terrible acting.  A ridiculous story.  Unlike other fantasy stories, (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc), I could not suspend disbelief and found myself constantly asking questions about what kind of society would do this.  Based on the books massive popularity, (no I have not read the books), I think I am just missing something here
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have HP e-print home & Biz on both my HTC cell phone and Kindle Fire and have used them both directly to a network printer and to hp e-printers around the country through HP print center. It took a while to understand the capabilities but I now use to print multimedia text messages and e-mail office documents and attachments locally and remotely on a regular basis. As an example, we routinely get photos in text messages from daughter in-law in NYC to Texas and print copies in OKC and at home. This includes color and size print settings from my phone. I have reviewed pdf legal documents on my Kindle fire and printed them on both an HP6500 E710-n ink jet and HP P1606dn Laser Jet. Very Satisfied.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|It was draw out. I read it but it was not the best book I have read. I was ready for the end. I was not impressed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely ADORE Pinterest! So happy that this app is available! I am glad that they fixed all the bugs, and the app now works perfectly on my LG Optimus G!
B00846REIS|1.0|The plot seemed very similar to 50 Shades of Gray but I couldn't get attached to the characters at all. Overall, it seemed to be missing something.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|The author is continuously updating character development throughout the book.  It is gruesome, engaging.  I like the way he uses \\"old\\" English. And detailed descriptions of what the principals are wearing give the story realism. All in all, an engaging story.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a compelling read<br />from start to finish.<br />The characters are well drawn and reveal themselves gradually.<br />The plot lines keeps you guessing and the tension holds until the end.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a book you won't want to put down! I finished it and ordered the third book right away.
B008ENNXQI|5.0|Fast and pretty picture and very nice display and very plegases to watched and enjoy this movie very much i likeit is so fast to watched
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|It was a good read. I have read his other books and they are also a good read. Nothing mind blowing, but not bad either. Gave it three stars.
B00633W614|5.0|Archer has assembled a wonderful cast of characters who are are well drawn and very interesting.  It's nice to see how they deal with obstacles that are thrown in their path and then overcome them. You are never quite sure what the outcome will be.  Now that I've read the first 2 books in the trilogy, I can't wait for the publication of the 3rd book.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Another great story from Nicholas Sparks with a twist at the end.  Although a little predictable and unrealistic at the end, the story line kept moving and I didn't want to put it down.  Great read!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great book. Loved every word of it. I really couldn't put it down and took my kindle everywhere in case I had a chance to read a little. I would love to read some other books like this one because it was so amazing.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I liked this book as much as the first one, which is uncommon in series sometimes. It is a good read and stays interesting. I recommend it, if you liked the first book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is fantastic! I love that I can create a note on my kindle fire, and later I can use my phone to see it. Great for grocery shopping! I can keep websites that I hear, or see about for reference later...or, even keep craft ideas so that I don't forget them. A+++ for this app! -
B008602KQI|5.0|it was no better or no worse than i expected.i'm satisfied and i certainly got what i paid for.can ask nothing better.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Well written and thoughtful, as expected. A pleasant visiting of an old friend with a rather introspective Bosch at his best.
B004BSCZ5A|5.0|Casual listeners may well be satisfied with the sound on earlier editions of the essential \\"Live At Leeds\\", but enthusiasts will be able to hear the difference in this edition: what was once glorious has become, uh, gloriouser?<br /><br />But the real surprise is the extra material: this includes not only the complete set of tracks recorded at the actual Leeds gig, but the material recorded (with some tweaking I hear) at the Hull City Hall the next night.  This second show differs wildly from Leeds (complete with glaring miscues and errors if you're paying attention), showing all the material in a brand-new (well, 42-year-old) light.  This truly showcases the improvisational nature of the Who: they basically had four soloists, each doing a two-hour improv at each and every show, and were the only band in the world who could make that enjoyable -- nay, thrilling.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Although not quite what I expected. The plot was interesting but the action was disconnected. It seemed that there were some points that while viewing it, I had to wonder how they got to the next scene.  Still, I would recommend the movie, but not to those whose main concern is having a 'fairy-tale' ending.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|These books are boring, I was hoping they would get better as more were written...guess not. Wish I could live a life were all I worried about was sex and nothing else.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great book. I am truly enjoying this story line. I loved the first book and can't wait to finish book two so I can get the third one! Fifty shades is a very dark romantic man!!!
B002ZG99A4|3.0|I like movies that I can escape from the real world for a few hours. The Expendables was a great waste of time, had no redeeming features and was enjoyable to watch. What more can you ask for from a movie.
B008MM9630|5.0|I cant get enough of this game! its challenging unlike other games similar to this one and that's what makes it fun!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really enjoyed the books and I thought the movie went well with the books. Acting was good for this type of film. Jennifer Lawrence was great as always.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Found Book I and II very easy reading.  It is unfortunate that people were narrow minded and judgemental as the author was setting up the story of a young child who endured a horrifice ordeal, overcame and was still haunted.<br /><br />The book(s) occasionally remined me of Pretty Woman where Anatasia Steele was introduced to a financial world with no boundaries.  Yet she was able to maintain her moral qualities and personality and was not influenced by this new culture one only dreams of.<br /><br />Book II just draws you in, chapter to chapter and I find it very difficult to put down.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Too much has already been said and written about this book so I won't go into my personal opinion but I did want to vote on it and I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />It's well-written and informative without giving away any trade secrets. If you are or were in the community, you don't need to read it. If you aren't and want to know more then I would recommend it. It's a quick, easy and exciting read and will give you a small window into what some sacrifices people chose to make for this country.
B002U3CCF6|4.0|Could not put this book down.  Have read all three of Gillian Flynn's books and they just keep getting better.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The best of the three books.  Will make you yearn for your own Mr. Christian Grey! Literally would stay up in too early morning hours to read after all had gone to bed.  Has a way of putting you in Ana's shoes thinking that this fantasy life could be yours.  You want to know what's going to happen next.
B007SGM084|4.0|overall was a good book, but did not live up to all the hype. the anita blake vampire series was steamier
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great aggregate app with dozens of versions of scripture and a wide variety of reading plans. highly recommended and something for everyone. also support is quick, helpful and friendly.
B00571F26Y|4.0|After reading \\"Wheat Belly\\" I was amazed to find out how many negative effects that simple grain has on me...It explained why, how and to what degree wheat has changed from its origin and why it causes so many problems with your health...The book is a good read..A little slow and technical at times, but seems credible with the documentation.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  I bought it because my daughter had recommended \\"The Forgotten Garden\\", and I wanted to read Kate Morton's first book before I read her recommended book. I would have liked more details about Grace's marriage to Alfred, and I would like to know more about Marcus.  I also would have liked to know more about how she went from maid to archeologist and more about Ruth's father.  The story was compelling and kept my interest, but I finished the book with some unanswered questions.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I like the way it is structured: this book can tell you from A to Z all you must know to get your book in kindle format.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|absolutely incredible!!!!! may be the best technically sound app for android as well as housing the greatest story ever told!!!!
1936608898|5.0|This book calls for some pretty serious changes in the average persons lifestyle. It requires a serious commitment to see it through.  Give the Whole 30 a chance. What do you have to lose? It's only 30 days.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I could not wait to read the next 2 books!! It was so much better than the movie.
B00846REIS|3.0|This was an ok book. Not as good as I thought it would be. It was a copy cat off of Fifty Shades. I will get the sequel though as I am curious to see what happens.
B007X3DQGM|4.0|This book came quickly and had more ideas than I could possibly use!  So glad I used my Amazon Prime as it was a little cheaper and I did not have to pay for shipping.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|With all the national hype that this trilogy received I expected a lot more from the series. It just wasn't what I expected. It was very boring at times and predictable.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|JOHN CARTER, SAT WELL WITH ME. WONT BE DISAPPOINTED. GREAT STORY LINE AND ENJOYED THE CHARATERS AND SETTING OF THIS MOVIE.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|THIS WAS AMAZING!!!!! I am having Christan Grey withdrawls!!!!!! I wish it never ended and there were more books to come.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn is a good summer read.  Lots of what's next? with the unexpected twists and turns throughout the novel.  It was a quick read and I have recommended it to all of my reading friends.
B004XZR63M|4.0|I ordered this book with some skepticism.  I am certainly not looking for a \\"get rich quick\\" solution, nor did I hope that Kiyosaki would somehow \\"change my life\\".  After coming across this author for years and reading mixed reviews, I caved in and finally downloaded the book.<br /><br />Now, after a quick and easy read, I can say I actually enjoyed the book and the messages Kiyosaki conveyed.  Many have debated whether this is a story based on reality, or if the two dads - Kiyosaki's traditional and conservative \\"real dad\\" vs. his friend's dad who taught him a new way of thinking about wealth and entrepreneurism -were real at all.  Frankly I don't care.  The stories were interesting and entertaining and I feel that the intended lessons were good ones for readers of all types.<br /><br />If you want an enjoyable and somewhat inspirational book that shares alternative views on money, wealth and happiness woven into a pseudo-autobiography (fictional or otherwise), I'd recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad.  I appreciate the author's perspective on how to change your mindset in order to grow.  But if you want a get rich quick manual, you should continue helping others like Kiyosaki get rich quick by buying all their products with misguided expectations.
B005IQZB14|1.0|i enjoyed reading this book and felt many emotions for the character.  i would recommend reading this book.  Nicely written and makes you think about yourself and life' challenges and how one reacts to situations.
B008EQIA7W|5.0|Love the mythology.  I wish there were more movies out there like this one.  My wife is a huge fan of these.  Go figure
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Overall this film was well done, well-acted, though possibly not well-directed--hence only 4 stars.  I'm fine with a film deviating from a book, and for the most part this one's unique telling of the story was acceptable.  A few differences weakened it, though.<br /><br />Regarding pacing, the film either crawled or sped by--there wasn't much of a happy medium--and that lack of continuity affected how the story was told.<br /><br />Including the POV of the game makers distracted from the emotional connection with Katniss and her plight.  The film would have been stronger shown solely through her perspective, as the book was.<br /><br />Apart from showing how oddly and ornately people in the Capital dressed, there wasn't a real sense of disparity between the lives of those in the Capital as opposed to the poor districts.  For that matter, the feel of the Capital came off more like a Rocky Horror parade than the sinister society that it is.<br /><br />Reducing the Games to merely reality TV competition undermined the story's theme of dire survival.  It seems that to keep ratings open to a wider audience, some of the true darkness of Katniss' life and predicament were short-changed.<br /><br />I also think if you hadn't read the book, most of the reason why you should care about what happened in the film was omitted.
B001BFWYXY|5.0|The album is great but sadly amazon cloud sucks.  I spent an evening attempting to download the tunes to my i-pod only to be frustrated at every turn.  My tech savy 18 year old son couldn't figure it out either!
B004P1JEXE|4.0|Great book and a rare thing to see the tv series is almost as good as the book and stays very true to the storyline. I will be reading more.
B008578PMU|5.0|Exciting, historical, all around a good movie. Would rent again. Having met some of the airman it mage it very special to see the representation on film
B000IZA9PI|5.0|I thought this movie was fantastic.  The plot was unusual from the other ones.  There were no humorous scenes.  It was a much deeper plot.  The music by Jerry Goldsmith was excellent.  It matched so well with the scenes.  The ending was a surprise to me.  My hope is for this franchise to make another movie.  They certainly have launch points.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|I'm compelled to write this, my first movie review, after watching Battleship. Unfortunately, the motivation is because Battleship is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And I'm a big sci-fi/action fan! I won't waste your time and will cut to the chase ... a thin plot, characters you won't want to care about, an incredibly annoying soundtrack (think a grade-school Van Halen cover band), and incredibly advanced but bungling aliens make this movie a forgettable experience.<br /><br />A superior alternative to Battleship and its alien invasion theme is the underrated Battle: Los Angeles. Battle has a much more compelling plot and spends time to do character development without slowing down the pace.
B002C949KE|4.0|Interesting take on how people react to different situations.  Amazing to read some of the studies that they preformed and reactions that certain stimulus have.<br /><br />Good Read!
B008602KQI|5.0|I won't give a blow by blow account of either the movie or the book. It's been done several times on Amazon and other places and quite well. However, I will say that, given the time constraints the director did an excellent job bringing the book to the screen, and that's what I wanted. I have watched the Blu-ray three times and every time, I see something new I missed before, an expression on an actor's face, a subtle placement of an object in the background foreshadowing future events and so on.<br /><br />None of the actors disappointed me. Katniss was Katniss, Rue,Rue. Although Donald Sutherland didn't quite fit the description of Snow in the book he was wonderful in the part. Now whenever I picture Snow, I see Sutherland. I also loved the look behind the scenes into the game maker's center.
B0043JDUNS|1.0|I must admit that this was my first movie in this genre for many years.  However,  I found the plot to be boringly predictable,  the acting is overdone and the story line was so far outside the realm of plausibility that it was impossible to connect with it at almost any level.  On top of that,  there is just not much about the characters that makes you want to either like them or dislike them.  I couldn't finish it.
B008L1PYQU|5.0|Every KISS fan around the world always wait for an item like this. If you love vinyl albums you´ll be happy to get this record. Sounds really great (loud and clear). The cover is awesome!! I also have the CD and it´s garbage compare to the vinyl edition. You can´t find too much differences between the songs in this record and the classic album, in fact I prefer \\"Detroit Rock City\\" of the first release but...who cares?? Enjoy it!!!!
B007JRUCGO|5.0|Received item quickly.  Grandaughter had been watching the original movie and loved it.  I had to get this for her. It is great!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Amazing!  Keeps you guessing all through the book!  I recommend that everyone read all the Gillian Flynn books they are great!
B004NOCCEG|5.0|This documentary does a splendid job of showing how the melt down of the economy in 2008 was an \\"inside job\\" -- carried out by the leaders of the financial sector. They are richly rewarded, but they did not serve the interests of either the corporations they ran or the broader society. Please watch this documentary!
B008602KQI|5.0|What an amazing movie. Make sure you read the series as well..Well cast. This one will stick with you. Can't wait for the next installment.
B0088TG252|4.0|Great plot and great acting. I was most surprised by Ryan Reynolds' performance --- convincing as a naive rookie agent yet serious enough to depict the role's struggle. Highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />My gripe is against Amazon streaming. Low quality in picture and the sound is so so. I recommend watching this movie on Blue Ray.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief deserves 5 stars! All you have to do is read the first page to know that Markus Zusak will keep you on your toes throughout, The Book Thief!<br /><br />The mysterious 3rd person point of view is like nothing I've ever read, and the fact that you get to see World War 2 through the eyes of Germans that did not support Hitler is even better!<br /><br />There is no boring moment while reading, The Book Thief! Oh,and the ending...lets just say...it's to die for ;)
B008602KQI|4.0|Fairly good movie.  But if you expected reasons for why or how this society got to this deplorable state you need to read the book.  The book shows what happens to a society that allows the government to control all aspects of you life, present and future.  The movie showed the results of the governmental control in the games but neglected to sow the progression of this path as it progressed.  I expect that there will be a second film to follow to show the resulting effects of a overcontroling government and a people that still long for freedom.<br />For Amazon the movie was delivered promptly as promised as with all purchases from Amazon.  Amazon is the best on-line retailer out there!
B0053O89JM|2.0|I believe House jumped the shark with Cuddy's departure, although the loss of other characters did not help.  Dropping Cameron, Amber and Masters were very bad choices.  Amber could have provided Wilson with some backbone.  Masters looked like the would be some morality added to his office.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this app but you know whats beter teple run brave and wheres my water i might be 8 but you should agree with me!!:)
B008VOHQNQ|5.0|Harvey is back at it again showing that he has layers to his personality. To see Harvey outside of his slick polished demeanor was great!
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I Really enjoyed the Mickey Haller (Lincoln Lawyer) Books! It was nice to find a courtroom series that kept me interested cover to cover!!!
B008J2GAKU|4.0|This is a good transition story for the new 52.  It brings in a connection to the old Gotham and the Gotham Batman now patrols.  It was also a great story showing the determination of Batman.  I loved this story in e format on kindle fire. Looking forward to more.
B008ASLNN2|1.0|Disjointed, poorly written and confusing.  Don't waste your time.  The first one was great and this is so poorly done.
B008YYCUES|5.0|Louis Lift is becoming my favorite guy on TV. It will be interesting to see how they develop his character.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games movie is a lot of fun.  It is well done and very entertaining.  The picture and audio quality are excellent on the Bluray.  I read the books before the movie and still enjoyed the movie.  There are changes between them but I still feel the movie captured the overall feel of the book in the end.  I recommend picking this movie up.
B008602KQI|5.0|just a great movie. My daughter and I saw it 5 times in the theaters and who knows how many since we got the dvd. cant wait for the second one
B006VA57CY|5.0|This whole series is superbly acted and produced. A soap opera with purpose. The cast has such great interaction and intensity.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|I had to move a family member from out of town.  Since there was no internet there I downloaded the maps I would need and took them with me and my Kindal.  It was so easy and helpfull... and no maps to tear loose or store afterwards.  Thanks!
B008K3HRF0|4.0|My sons and I thoroughly enjoye this movie! Of you're looking for something \\"safe\\" to watch with your kids that's not violent etc this is a great choice!
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|I read all of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian series as a teenager and loved them.  (I also read all of the Tarzan series, all 26 or 27, whatever the total number was he wrote.)  So I was very pleased that the were making a movie of what turned out to be \\"The Princess of Mars,\\" the first book of the Martian series.  For the most part they did a good job, but I was completely disappointed in two things.<br /><br />First and foremost was the character of John Carter.  A self-centered jerk who cares only for himself is about as far wrong as you can get from the John Carter of Edgar Rice Burroughs.  John Carter is a Southern Gentleman, complete with proper manners and would certainly come to the aid of an damsel in distress with having to be prodded and cajoled.  He was also a great swordsman, not a butcher swinging a cleaver.<br /><br />The other item was the whole \\"superior race\\" and completly invented explaination for how John Carter traveled back and forth between Earth and Mars.  How John Carter got there was a mystery he never understood, and ERB never bothered to explain.  They should have left well enough alone, as what they came up with certainly detracted from the story.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|This movie is an all time classic. I absolutely love it. I have watched it several times since being told about it and I always enjoy every moment.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I enjoy this program. The characters are realistic to me. I know they are criminals. It is exciting to watch. I bought all avaialable seasons from Amazon & love love love watching this way.......... NO commercials!!!!
B007HB5TN8|5.0|I've read this beautiful novel only three times. A British Prime Minister read it 26. My novel, \\"The War Less Civil\\" [[ASIN:B008L5PINA THE WAR LESS CIVIL]], deals with issues Miss Austen would be shocked, and in some cases, horrified by. But never would she fail to understand the unchanging character of the human condition that I wrote about in 19th & 20th century America. Her insights into the human spirit and behavior in the early 1800s, seemingly so simple and commonplace, are as deep as the most profound novelists of any age. If one desires a book offering endless pleasure, one that could be reread once a year for a lifetime, then I strongly urge one to read \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"
B0055PMURG|4.0|The movie is awesome unfortunately it stopped a few times in between which sure wasnt our internet connection.<br />The movie itself is a must see and we did get to finish it at some point.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book had a good story to it overall and it kept my interest even though it seemed to drag on and on sort of repeating the same old things over and over.<br /><br />The part that totally disappointed me so much was the ending.  It was not at all what I expected and was a bad way to end a one-half way decent book.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Anyone seeking to gain better understanding of themselves and those they hold dear need to read this book.  I wish I could have read this 50 years ago...so validating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book read it in two days very awesome concept. Already up to the third book and hope the Author has some other great stuff to read
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie, we loved it.  I hope people see the underlying story about how Big Government always becomes corrupt over time.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I hope the prequel has another book to come. I want to know about the early Thomas and Theresa. (Possible spoiler - Is Dee Dee Theresa?) How do all the group meet etc... I do like the story here and the characters but I had become invested in the maze runner group and I need to know more about them pre wipe. I did like the adventure part in the beginning, it was suspenseful and thing kept happening.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|This movie was a waste of time. Actors were all annoying and there wasn't any chemistry between any of them. Plot was dumb and ending very predictable.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|Twitch Tv is an all right app. I was able to watch t<br />plenty of Gamescom 2012 on it, one of the downsides was the quality. Lastly, it needs more features,  like being able to sign in to your account or searching by genres and what not. Overall this is worth your time
B00555X8OA|5.0|Kahneman does an excellent job of explaining current thinking on how we make decisions, based on his solid research background. His writing style pulls you in and keeps you reading. This book is essential for the thinker's library.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Baby boy loves the Soothie pacifier.  The plush toy makes it easy to prop up on the baby so the pacifier stays in place.  Also helps me keep it from hitting the ground when moving him around.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have been recommending this book to everyone I know.  It is rare to find such an engrossing and well researched book.  I wish all three books of the trilogy were out already, though, as it has been a long wait to learn how my favorite characters are doing.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|This is the official user guide for setting up and using the Raspberry Pi Model B credit card size Linux single-board computer that costs $35 (plus taxes and shipping).  The guide was written by Raspberry Pi Foundation co-founder Eben Upton, whose day job is application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) architect (and general troublemaker, as he states it) for the semiconductor device manufacturer Broadcom.  His co-author is self-described freelance technology journalist, writer, programmer, electronics designer, and erstwhile sysadmin Gareth Halfacree, whose writing appears in publications such as \\"Linux User & Developer\\", \\"Custom PC\\", \\"Micro Mart\\", \\"IT Pro\\", \\"Bit-Tech\\" and \\"Expert Reviews\\".<br /><br />The book properly starts with a short, but fascinating, history of how the Raspberry Pi came to be, starting as an idealist concept and a much simpler (and much less capable) breadboard prototype half a dozen years ago, compared with the real deal.  As Eben recounts it, the Foundation gradually realized that they had accidentally and unintentionally promised a $25 ~ $35 computer to over 100,000 very expectant and enthusiastic fans, a bit more than the couple of hundred boards they had originally thought they would just give away to prospective students applying to Cambridge University's computer science curriculum.  In less than a year, the Pi went from being just-another seemingly great idea that had a very uncertain but potentially great future, to an astoundingly successful reality, with several hundred thousand manufactured and delivered so far, to what are by all accounts highly-satisfied customers.<br /><br />The book then gets down to the nitty-gritty of how to connect the board to the necessary (and not included) power supply, USB keyboard and optional mouse, HDMI display, and optional wired Ethernet and audio system hardware.  Instructions are also provided for creating a bootable SD memory card on a Linux/Windows/Mac desktop or laptop computer that contains the recommended Debian Linux operating system and user files.  A subsequent entire chapter describes the basics of the Linux OS, how to administer the system at a fundamental level and, most importantly, how to obtain the most up-to-date version of the OS, which will require a wired Ethernet connection.  WiFi networking is possible with the Pi, but not fully detailed in this chapter - it is discussed in more depth in the network configuration chapter.  Another full chapter describes how to troubleshoot the keyboard and mouse, power issues, boot-up problems, and network connection gremlins.<br /><br />The chapters in the second part of the book discuss wired and wireless network configuration, SD card storage partition management, configuring the Pi hardware via config.txt, start.elf, and cmdline.txt boot-time files.  Then, additional chapters describe how to set up the Pi as a Home Theatre PC (HTPC) for playing music and video from files or over the Internet, to use it as a productivity using freeware such as OpenOffice and the Gimp image editor, configuring the Pi as a web server using a Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP (LAMP) software stack, and installing WordPress to create your own blogging server.<br /><br />In the third part of the book, the authors get down to what the Pi was originally developed for: teaching software programming.  The first examples demonstrate how to use the very child-friendly MIT Scratch to create the canonical Hello World program, in addition to simple animation and sound, game, and robotics sensor programs.  The lessons then shift to the much more capable and more complex Python language, showing another Hello World example, then how to handle comments, inputs, variables, and loops.  It ends with how to use the pygame code library to develop much more sophisticated games than can be accomplished with Scratch.<br /><br />Additional chapters cover hardware interfacing with the Pi board via the built-in General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) port to access the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) serial bus, Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C) bus, and the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus.  How to access the GPIO port via Python is discussed in detail, complete with code examples for how to flash an LED and read whether a pushbutton is being pressed.  A valuable brief guide to soldering is included for budding hardware hackers, followed by descriptions of the Ciseco Slice of Pi, Adafruit Prototyping Pi Plate, and Gert van Loo's wonderful Fen Logic Gertboard.  The book ends with appendices containing Python code examples (also available by download from the publisher's web site) and the HDMI display modes that can be set via the boot-up configuration files.<br /><br />The book reads very well for beginners who are the target audience, and none-too-soon.  The geeks have been spewing techno-jargon on the RaspberryPi.org forums and eLinux.org wiki for many, many months, even well before the Pi was even available to the general public.  The best thing about the book is that it brings together in one place all of the information that novices need to know in a form that can actually be understood by mere mortals.  The fact that it's written by the principal designer of the Pi with education experience and a published personal computing author and journalist goes a long way to making that possible.  Other tech authors might be too tempted to jump off into the deep end of the technical pool more quickly than would be warranted.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed with Chapter 12: \\"Hardware Hacking\\", for its very complete and clear descriptions of the Pi GPIO port, add-on hardware options, and how to wire everything together and program the Pi to interact with an LED and a pushbutton.  Especially appreciated is the several pages dedicated to both on-line and retail sources for the add-on components, including solderless prototyping breadboards and the individual parts such as LEDs, resistors, pushbuttons, etc.  A couple of pages are also spent just to describe how to read the colo(u)r codes on resistors, and a complete list of the tools and materials needed to perform soldering are provided as part of the soldering guide.  Another whole page provides the details on how to calculate the proper resistor values to limit the current flowing through an LED for various voltages - this kind of detail often slips through the cracks in such books.<br /><br />The full Kindle e-book cost me a \\"whopping\\" whole $6.60 and I'm a 1970s era veteran of when men were men and computers were made of iron.  So, I'm definitely not in the target audience, but even I found enough tiny new details that I'd still missed despite reading tens of thousands of forum and wiki posts, that the price of the e-book has to be the best bargain in tech writing that I can think of in an extremely large number of years.  As I understand it, the Raspberry Pi Foundation benefits from the profits for the book, as it does from sales of each Pi board.  As far as I'm concerned, they could have charged ten times the price for the book and it would still be a complete bargain.  I haven't checked every single detail in the book, yet, but, I didn't see any glaring errors.  Yet, I'm one of those people to whom even any misspelling stands out like a geek on the runway at a Paris fashion show, and I don't mean at the airport.  Those who know me at all are aware of my persnickety nature, and I really tried to find problems in this book, but I have to say that's a pretty tall order.<br /><br />No one has any excuse now for not learning computer science fundamentals with a Pi, thanks to this book.  Just go spend about $50 for this book and a Pi and you'll be much better off than consuming the equivalent cost in a week's worth of froo-froo caffeine beverages - five very broad smilies from this admitted SillyCon Valley curmudgeon!o access the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) serial bus, Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C) bus, and the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the whole trilogy, but, I thought book two was the best! I really only get to read on the train to and from work, so at one point in the book I got so excited about what just happened I yelled out YES FINALY! Well, all I can say is I turned fifty shades of red as everyone turned to look at the crazy woman yelling from behind her Kindle.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Great acting, wonderful dialogue and an amazing recreation of a society during WWI and afterwards. first season was very compelling watching. Second season was also very good, but a few plot twists involving amnesia and a recovery from paralysis seem more like soap opera than Masterpiece Theater. i still wanted to see season 3 at the conclusion
B007IXWKUK|3.0|A good bed time read with more insight into the characters and some interesting twists of drama. Some vocabulary over used too many times \\"Jeez\\" \\"inner goddess\\" \\" my Fifty \\"....
B008VBYN80|5.0|this game is the best game in the world I am already level seven ive almost beat the barbearien king
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It was pretty good. Not my favorite book and not all S&M like I thought. I would recommend it just don't expect a whole lots of that stuff
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story continued to keep me interested. This was a fantastic end to a great trilogy. It made me want to read them all again!
B008602KQI|5.0|Love the movie in Blu Ray on my LED. Great picture and sound. If you loved it in theaters you will love the Blu Ray.
B000Y96EWK|5.0|I'm sorry I waited so long to watch the movie.  My loss. It's a great film and it leaves you hanging and wanting more!  The extras are a great way to see what went into making such a wonderful production.
B004CFAWK2|4.0|I had purchased this book for my father to read, but decided to read it first, and thouroughly enjoyed it.  I have seen the movie many times, but as usual found the book to be more enjoyable. The story flowed nicely and I really liked the little news chapters by Dot Weems.  I would definetly recommend this book.
B004UPAIDK|5.0|Rarely is a sequel better than the first, but this is.  One of the best, if you like these types of movies.
B006RUJST6|4.0|Based on the title, I was thinking Christan Grey part 4..not the case. Loved this book, got hooked after chapter 3. It's a quick read and fairly realistic..prob not a good book club choice because there isn't much to discuss/debate.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was moving.  It was hard to think any adult could do such cruel things to a child.  Jaycee learned to cope with the situation much better than many people.  The fact that she has gone on with her life post abduction and is leading as much normal a life as possible is truly inspiring.  Those people who have experienced far less and blame all their problems on \\"their life\\" should take note.  Jaycee is truly an amazing and inspiting woman.
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|An extremely good western with great characters and performances by Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, and Charles Bronson. Henry Fonda plays the ultimate antagonist, Charles Bronson is the classic cool good guy, and Jason Robards stars as the light hearted bad guy who gets a mistaken reputation. The movie script is well written drama with good action scenes and an understated love story that made my brother-in-law shed a tear.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Good music. Excited to see what else she can do. National Anthem is in my head all of the time
B008JF8O9M|5.0|Was able to print a boarding pass from my kindle Fire to the wireless printer.  A cool app at that!  Thank you Print Bot.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have used the Pinterest app and I've used the web page. I find the app even easier to use than the web site, if that's possible.
B00846REIS|5.0|I must say I held the bar very high when comparing this to 50 shades of Grey HOWEVER, Sylvia Day Knocked this out of the park.  It was more realistic and believable.  You could actually relate to this book and it held my interest from page one!  I read this is 2 days and I have a 2year old so I stay busy but every spare moment I had I read this book.  I have already pre-ordered the sequel and I can't wait for October 2nd to come and then December 31st for the 3rd book.  Kudos to S. Day for this one!
B003GX5CWY|5.0|it's kind of a like a harlem globetrotters ensemble of tough guy actors for this movie but it's good that you actually get to spend some time with all of them before the inevitable killing off starts. it's a good concept as well, human beings as the prey and it really adds a lot to the plot in that for once there is an explanation for why the evil being doesn't just wade right in and murder everybody at the very beginning. there's some hilarious slo-mo shots which in another lesser movie would probably kill your interest stone dead - watch out for apollo creed hamming it up to the max in one example. arnie's really good in this movie, almost understated! in short, a great action movie that has so far stood the test of time.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Although this book was recommended by friends, I thought the story ended up being kind of contrived. Although a very dark story indeed, sometimes the grim episodes seemed put in just for shock value. Not a \\"feel-good\\" story, that's for sure! A very quick read, it did fill a few hours but did not stick with me afterwards.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|In a world with pollution and always  degraded environment is an always increasing preoccupation this movie help the little one to understand the importance of living in balance with nature and the consequences of not doing so.<br /><br />It is an entertaining and yet nature conscious movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|I had already seen this movie in the Theater and thought it was very well done.  It followed the book very well.  I was pleasantly surprised to be able to download the movie on my Kindle for free because of purchasing the digital copy.<br /><br />Also, there was very little graphic violence so my 9 year old grandson was able to watch a lot of the movie and enjoy it.
0425263908|5.0|Sylvia Day is probably so fed up of having her book compared to Fifty Shades of Grey - so I'm not going to. If this book was released either a year earlier or later then no one would be comparing. This book was so much better than the aforementioned. Here's what I thought.<br /><br />I loved Eva. She was sparky, determined, quirky and had such a huge personality that I took to her straight away. Her awesome best friend is a relationship I am very envious of and totally completes her.<br /><br />But then comes the day when she helps somebody out and gets knocked on her ass. And catches the eye of Gideon Cross who takes her breathe away. The build up of their relationship is tense. She really tries to back down but his instance is tenacious.<br /><br />Soon a complicated love story continues. Both Eva and Gideon consider themselves damaged, and both of them know full well that they can help each other to heal their wounds. But it comes at a price. Can they get past their stubborn sides and win each other over for good?<br /><br />The depth of character Day has created for both Gideon and Eva is remarkable. Clearly lots of thought has gone into writing this book. Its sexy, witty and Gideon is as hot as hell!<br /><br />The book does end abruptly but now I think all readers are dying to know more about Gideon's past as no indication was given in this first book. I'm eagerly waiting for Reflected in You. I can't wait to read more.
B008M36EEI|4.0|This film is really enjoyable.  It's not high action or heavy in romance or comedy, though it does have a bit of all.  It's well acted and the story is engaging.  It include some terrific British stars in different types of roles than you've seen them in before.  I'd wanted to see this film since it's theatrical release and was so glad I finally did!
B007HO392S|5.0|I love love love this album!<br />It's awesome and there isn't a single song that I don't like.<br />Even my three year old loves to sing along.<br />I definitely recommend this one!
B001NLKT60|5.0|The girl who played with fire was a great continuation of the sometimes slow moving 1st book \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo\\".  This one moved faster and developed quite the intricate story!  I couldn't wait to start the last one!
006056251X|5.0|I just completed reading the entire Wallflowers series of books.  As a whole I give the collection 5 stars.  I enjoyed a couple books more than others, but considering the entire work, the story of the Wallflowers flowed wonderfully from book to book.<br /><br />I decided to review all the books together as one unit in case the reader would like to see how the Wallflowers' stories interweave and would like to read them in order.  I began out of order by reading the third book first and wish I hadn't done it that way.  It kind of took some of the surprise out of the first two books for me.<br /><br />The Wallflowers are a group of four young women who, for various reasons, seem to be unable to attract the interest of gentlemen to dance with them at balls or ask for their hand in marriage.  For a couple seasons they had ignored each other and sat alone on the sides watching and wishing.  One day they break their silence and a wonderful friendship begins.  They plot and plan and decide as a group they can hatch plans to get each other wed.  Each Wallflower has her own book.<br /><br />Book 1--Secrets of a Summer Night was about Annabelle and Simon.  Annabelle's family was destitute and facing the possibility of being turned into a life of servitude if Annabelle didn't marry well.  She was in her last season of husband hunting because she was just getting too old to attempt another.  She was desperate to marry a well off member of the peerage in order to rescue her family.  Annabelle and the other Wallflowers came up with a scheme to compromise and trap a young Lord into marriage.  However, Annabelle wasn't counting on the attraction she felt for Simon Hunt, a common businessman who happened to be wealthy beyond measure.  Hunt seemed to find amusement as he watched Annabelle fumble and regroup time and time again.  He was willing to bide his time until Annabelle would willingly go to him to become his mistress.  Will Annabelle get her Lord, or will she end up defeated?Read this book to find out.<br /><br />Watching the cat and mouse game played out between Simon and Annabelle was rather enjoyable.  The scene in the book at the railroad facility was very emotional.  Overall I felt this book was well written.  The hero of the next book is featured quite nicely in this story without overshadowing the focus of the main characters.  I'm adding it to my keeper pile and feel I would enjoy rereading it somewhere down the road.<br /><br />Book 2--It Happened One Autumn is the story of Lillian--a very outspoken American debutante whose family became wealthy in the soap manufacturing business--and Lord Westcliff.  Westcliff was one of the oldest and richest earldoms in England.  Marcus, Lord Westcliff, shouldn't be attracted to Lillian due to her bawdy American ways making her entirely unsuitable for a wife, but he couldn't help the pull of attraction.  The more Lillian did to earn his stern disapproval the more Marcus found himself being unable to resist.  What happens when this stubborn stern man meets the highly opinionated and free spirited Lillian?  Explosive chemistry and heat overtakes them both.  This story shows how opposites truly do attract and make fine bedfellows, that is, if they can get past Westcliff's mother who vehemently disapproves of Lillian.<br /><br />The reader is introduced to the hero of the third book in this story--St. Vincent.  St. Vincent is quite the charmer and tries to woo Lillian away from Westcliff.  The reader finds out that St. Vincent is in desperate need of a wealthy heiress.  Luckily for him his scruples don't mind if the heiress is American or not.  Although he and Marcus are long time friends, St. Vincent does something fiendishly awful toward the end of this book.  I really enjoyed his character even though he was the bad guy.<br /><br />Book 3--The Devil in Winter is about Evie and St. Vincent.  The book opens with the shy stammering Evie making St. Vincent an offer he can't refuse.  She is desperately trying to escape her cruel family so she can see her father before he dies.  St. Vincent is brooding over the outcome of book 2 in the Wallflowers series and still needs to find that heiress to marry.  The book begins with a hasty marriage between the two, and we get to watch as St. Vincent begins his journey from cad to reformed rake.  St. Vincent has many past hurts from his childhood.  He had an uncaring father, and every woman who was important in his life was taken from him by death.  He builds walls up around his heart and wears a mask of aloofness and won't let anyone get too close.  Well he wasn't prepared for the force of nature that is our Evie.  Can she penetrate his shell and melt his heart?  You definitely need to read this book to find out.  This is the book I began the series with.  It kind of spoiled It Happened One Autumn for me since the end of the book was told in the beginning of this one.  If you intend to read the entire series I would recommend with book 1 and following the series in order.<br /><br />Finally, book 4--Scandal in Spring is the story of Daisy--the youngest of the Wallflowers and Lillian's sister--and Matthew.  Daisy's father, Mr. Bowman, is tired of the money he poured into the husband hunt not paying off.  He gives Daisy an ultimatum of either finding a husband by the end of the season or he will force her to marry Matthew whom her father adores.  Daisy, of course, cannot stand Matthew.  She sees him as the usurper of her father's affections.  Mr. Bowman has always been focused on his business and did not have time to show his family attention or love.<br /><br />Daisy was unprepared for the drastic changes in Matthew.  She can't seem to help the elemental pull she feels toward him when she sees him again.  However, Matthew tells Daisy there is no way he would ever consider marrying her.  Not one to give up on a challenge, Daisy finds a way into Matthew's heart.<br /><br />This book has a rather big scandal in it.  The reader is informed Matthew has a huge secret looming over his past and this is the reason he has never allowed himself to act on his feelings toward Daisy.  The unfurling of the scandal was nicely written.  I truly did not see it coming, but enjoyed it a great deal.  I felt Matthew was forgiven a bit too easily though and felt it was unlikely everyone would believe his story immediately.  That just wasn't too realistic.  However, I did enjoy the book a great deal.<br /><br />So, while I did enjoy the entire series I rank my favorites in this order . . .<br /><br />The Devil in Winter--5 stars all the way<br />Secrets of a Summer Night--5 stars<br />It Happened One Autumn--4 stars<br />Scandal in Spring--3.5 stars<br /><br />I plan on putting all four books on my keeper shelf.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I've used Feedly off and on for quite a while. I used it on my desktop a few years back, even. The app looks fantastic on the Kindle Fire and keeps getting better. Wish it were a little easier to mark things as read and have it sync new ones (occassionally I can't get rid of items marked as read). Otherwise, I'll be keeping it. Best RSS reader for Kindle fire (love the iPhone app, as well)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books were absolutely great! All of them contained the perfect balance of drama, love, passion, fun and sport. E.L James gave the perfect portion of suspense in each book and the final book answered alot of questions the reader had. The sex scenes are nothing short of exotic and erotic. These books are absolutely delicious. I plan to read over all three books :)
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was an incredible ending to quite the story of conspiracy and government coverups.  The justice served in the end was absolutely incredible.  It's too bad Steig Larsson is not around to continue writing!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I like that i can do pinning on my kindle but it crashes ALOT! More times than not I try to log on and i cant that is vety frustrating!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have really enjoyed the solitaire game. It is easy to play, easy to read and helps to pass the time. It requires no brain power to play just an understanding of the game. As you all no there are times when you wish you were somewhere else (usually during a business meeting) and this is helpful. Hope you get the picture.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Once again Michael Connelly comes through. I have read every novel and short story by the author and have never been let down. This group continues his best writing.
B008EQIEWS|2.0|I'm writing this review 2 weeks after watching the movie and I can't remember a thing. It had okay action at best. I used a discount code to get it so not that big of a loss.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Last read Wuthering Heights as a teenager, now at 69 enjoyed Bronte's classic even more.  The depth of the characters and their interactions heightened my senses.  Bronte's words were so descriptive they inspired me to continue on my journey through rereads.
B0034G4ORC|2.0|I didn't 'hate' this movie. The concept was there, but it could have definitely been much better.<br /><br />I started watching this movie without reading any descriptions or having any clue of the storyline.<br /><br />That being said I assumed it was a human conflict movie. I did not realize it was an alien invasion movie.<br /><br />The movie starts off pretty quick with you finding out it is aliens that are invading. I'd say about 10-15 minutes in.<br /><br />After that its 2 hours of a group of american soldiers dodging an astronomical amount of enemy shots.<br /><br />How any of them are eluding the onslaught of alien projectiles is beyond me. It took away from the realism.<br /><br />Also, because of this account, it made the aliens seem unintelligent, which in turn didn't make you feel uneasy seeing them.<br /><br />It was more like 'oh boy...there goes another dumb alien.'<br /><br />I felt more uneasy watching the movie Signs, when the alien ran past the window for 2 seconds near the end.<br /><br />The movie seemed forever long and I found myself longing for the end to come after investing some time into this movie.<br /><br />Also, I didn't feel a connection to any of the characters. So whenever a character died, as dramatic as they were trying to make it seem, it wasn't.<br /><br />I feel they definitely could have made this movie shorter and it would have helped make it a better movie, but it was too drawn out.<br /><br />As I said, I did not HATE the movie per say. But it is not one of those movie where I feel the need to ever see it again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am enjoying all the different ways this Bible has set up for you so that you can follow a specific plan to read the Bible in a desired amount of time.  It also has sections where if you are grieving it gives specific chapters and verses to read.  It has a daily devotional to follow if you want.  There are numerous ways to read the Bible and this Bible has it all set up for you.  Just pick and choose.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Lee Child does not waste any time in getting the reader interested in the book.  The conflict slowly unravels with twists and turns that keep a reader making constant predictions about what will happen next.
6305428387|5.0|Great movie to watch with the family. Good sportsmanship. Teamwork. Pride. Family & more addressed in this movie. Love it again and again.
B00122RG4S|4.0|T Rex was such a smart, tuneful band. Way ahead of their time and still such a moment in Brit Pop history.  Great production values. A real exuberant sense of fun is heard in this music. You can't help but smile.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Ilove this book.  When I purchased it, I started reading it and couldn't put it down.  I finished it and immediately started at the beginning again.<br /><br />Excellent writing and story<br /><br />Wendy
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|SUPER DVD, FOR THOSE THAT READ THE BOOK.  UNFORTUNATELY, IF YOU DIDN'T READ THE BOOKS, THERE WERE TOO MANY QUESTIONABLES.  PERSONALLY, I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE.
B005CVWWJY|3.0|Very much enjoyed it, easy read, full of 80's references, book is set in a dystopian future, where the mmo rules almost! If you love the 80's, movies, gaming, rpg's, music, tv, you will enjoy this! EDIT after reading it a 2nd time, not so great, the writing is a little too juvenile, the switches between perspectives is not done well.
B008M34CSI|4.0|Action and intrigue.  I liked this movie.  I'm finding a good 85% of movies hum drum, and wouldn't think of recommending them.  This is the sort of movie that you can enjoy with friends who have gathered for movie night.  I found Danny Glover a bit suspect, however.
B005JE7WKI|4.0|This movie was just what I was looking for today.  Stupid humor, but still pretty witty at times.  Laughed a lot.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I know why this book is completely addictive, after all, I've fallen for it as well. But the truth is it's poorly written, there's no depth to the characters and it's completely predictable. If you haven't started with 50 shades, I strongly recommend you go for something worthier of your time
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a fun read!!! I couldn't put it down, and when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. So many ups and downs and turns to this live story....it brought me back to my college days!! Can't wait for the next book to cone out so I can read Travis' point of view.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Pretty good movie, with eyebrow raising characters.  Because this movie had been an event and had a hype history, I engaged in some web research, after viewing, to fill in some of the book vs movie gaps.  Found a sight that reviewed 31 differences between the two, and this rounded out the experience.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is a \\"Reality show made into a movie\\".  It was okay if you like reality shows.  It just goes to show you how brutal reality can be.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this handy Kindle alarm app. It is very reliable and has some pleasant options for waking you up.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|This app is a great start.  I wish the free version had more options.  But from the free side it does give you alot of choices for diffrent sound combonations.
B008EQIK90|2.0|I didn't think that I would like this, but read some fantastic reviews about all of it good points.  I did not like this movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was so awesome and depicted the book as best it could from the time that was allotted.  I cannot wait for a sequel, hopefully, to have closure.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|First reaction is shock.  As the plot emerges it becomes facinating, and you are eager to see what happens next.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|THE FIRST BOOK WAS OK AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT ....THEN THE STORY LINE STARTED TO GET A LITTLE BORING OR NOT INTERESTING AS I READ THE NEXT SEQUEL. IT DIDNT HOLD MY ATTENTION ANY MORE AND I STOPPED READING THE SEQUELS.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This was good in showing how humans developed up to this time intellectually.  All humans need to do know is update their religious philosophies.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Loved Quell. Love Quell Reflect. If the only flaw you can find in an app is that it reminds you to rate it, and you use that as justification for knocking a star, then you just get some kind of sick pleasure out of hating on stuff.<br /><br />If Quell could rate you as a person, it would only give you 4 stars for being grumpy.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Loved this story and couldn't wait to get to sequel. Almost finished with point of retreat but I don't want it to end!
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie. Saw it at the theater, have read the books and wanted to have the DVD.  Needed to have the closed caption so I didn't miss anything.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I'm using this with a Baby Jogger City Mini GT. It fits better when the handle is in the lower position (the higher one makes it sit at a slight angle). I had a water bottle, my phone and keys in it. There was room for another drink/bottle and possibly a snack cup. I like having my drink right at the handle instead of in the mesh pockets at the back of the stroller. It's a little flimsy, but I didn't have to take it off to fold the stroller. I wouldn't put a hot beverage in the cup holder part, but I think that's probably true of any parent tray. For the price, I think it's a good product and it does what I need it to do.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really loved this game. Gets pretty challenging to get perfect finishes in the later levels. Kept me hooked to the very end. I, for one, don't mind when an app reminds me to rate. Even though it's a paid app, it's being sold for far less than it's worth and good reviews help the dev sell more copies. After all, the key to making any real money on a $0.99 app is to sell a boatload of copies.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I am so happy that I decided to download this. Fantastic reads! Do yourself a favor and download to your kindle.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Very good book. My daughter loves these stories. I love reading now too. We can't wait for the new book to come out in October.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved these books.  The characters are wonderful!  They are soooo cute.  I loved all the text messages they send each other.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I bought this since the timer on my Galaxy S 4G didn't seem to want to work at all which i am glad I did since it lets me have multiple timers programed.. :)
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This was another great book by Philippa Gregory. It is a well written book to add to the cousins war series. I can't wait for her next book to come out. I truly enjoy the depth and voice she gives her characters.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yes, this book contains alot of graffic sex, but it also does a great job of developing complex characters.  You can't help but love Ana and Christian.<br /><br />I bought all 3 books of the trilogy and each one is very different from the last.  I am going to be very disappointed when I finish the 3rd book because I have enjoyed following the couple on their journey in getting to know themselves, their bodies and each other.
B0088TG252|5.0|Denzel and Reynolds are great.  Good story.  Maybe a bit predictable but still worth the time, especially if your a fan of either of these actors.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I bought this because I am not very good at fractions like most humans and would recommend it to others. Now if i can find it for my phone so I dont have to track down my Kindle Fire to use it it would be awsome and complete.  :)
B00338QENI|1.0|This book is EXTREMELY boring.  Unless you are someone who enjoys books about science and/or stem cell research, I would not recommend this book.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Too much repetition. Found it hard to keep reading and it had way o much sex. Sex is not bad but this was overkill on the subject for my taste
B0027MJU00|4.0|This is written like a true story. Libby is a sad product of the destruction of her family when she was a child. I found the book to be a real page turner. It has twists and turns that keep it interesting. I highly recomend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I never in a thousand years would have predicted the ending of this book! It is so shocking and thought provoking that it makes me take a double-take at who I think myself to be. I feel a distinctive buzz through my veins in recollection. This whole series is a fight between law and morality, and Katniss' struggle touches something tangible in the soul of the reader.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|George R. R. Martin's ability to create a fantasy world rich with history never ceases to impress me. This was another enjoyable read of his.
B0081L391C|5.0|Thia movie makes me laugh out loud every time I watch it.... And I've watched it A LOT! Definitely one of my favorite movies and Channing Tatum is in it... Enough said.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is awesome.  I did not read the book but I am in the process of reading it now.  Great acting, great visuals, very well done.  A lot of people suggest reading the book, but I am not much of a book reader.  I like to see things visually and this does it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first person-present layout of the book threw me off at first, but as I continued to read, it made everything so real to me, and I related much more deeply with the situation and characters. What an incredibl story -and one that is theoretically plausible -historically so as well (Collusseum, anyone?)! The thought sends chills through me. Very good book!
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|This is the second copy I've bought of this book.  I am in a group of people who are helping each other achieve financial freedom, and this book is the first one that was recommended for the group to read.  There is a lot of wisdom in this book, and I truly believe everyone should read it if they don't want to stay broke.
B003204MQS|5.0|In the beganing I didn't think the \\"Found Footage\\" genre would ever be scary. The Blair Witch Project was terrible, Cloverfield was stupid, Diary of the Dead was fine, but nothing special and don't get me started with Quarantine.  I didn't think these types of horror movies would ever be scary, that was until I saw Paranormal Activity.  It's about a couple who start to notice strange things going on at night, so Katie's boyfriend records what goes on at night. As he continues to record, more strange things start to happen, and it's seems to be connected to Katie.  It all ends with a chilling ending that will leave you breathless.  Paranormal Activity is without a doubt the best horror movie made in the past decade, it's a must see for any fan of horror or movies alike, so buy a copy today.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I haven't finished the book. It is all about sex.. I am moving on to something more informative and/or more intellectlually stimulating.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow, this was as exciting as its predicessor! I can't wait to read the next one! I was a little concerned at first that it would be a repeat of the first Hunger Games all over again, but it shone through marvelously!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. You are left guessing until the very end. Highly recommended reading!
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|love it.  if you want a review, you are going to have to accept what I've written.  I bought something from you and now you want me to take time to come up with a well written revieiw.  I don't owe you that. It was good and I loved it.  That's it.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|this book starts out kind of slow but in the middle it stahrts to pick up and Im really liking it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I downloaded this book from Amazon.com after receiving a flyer in the mail to order the book.  This book has changed my life and I made the change to \\"wheat free\\" only 4 weeks ago.  I still have weight to lose, but I already can see and feel a difference in my skin.  My aches and pains have nearly all subsided. I no longer have bags under my eyes and the swelling in my feet and legs is totally gone.  I know that I will be healthier once I have been wheat free for a longer period of time.  I am so looking forward to my new life at 59! This is an exciting journey to be on. I had given up totally on ever losing another pound, after trying nearly every diet out there.  This is not a diet, it is a life style change that actually does wonders for the body and the mind! I feel healthy again!  Thank you Dr. Davis!
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Of course every song is original and you'll love listening to it. I think I listen to Aha and show you how to love the most. YOU SHOULD BUY IT :)
B000MQC9H4|1.0|This is my favorite movie at the moment, I was so excited when it arrived. Sadly on playing the movie the sound isnt timed with the picture so you lip read and then the sound kicks in secs later.  This wouldnt be so bad except with this movie, there are lots of close up romantic moments, so its really obvious, wont buy a video on line again :-(
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Great quality, great story. Rick Grimes is the truth. A must watch! If you have Netflix season 1 is available to watch.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Sooo good. I read all 3 books in less than a week.  Edge of your seat reading,had trouble putting it down to go to work
B008602KQI|4.0|I read all three books so I know  (or Hope) the other two movies are in production. I just had to  explain this to my friends who watched this with me.
B0000013G9|4.0|This album is as smooth, sexy, and seducing as a marvin gayve album. If there were anyone to fill in that void that we lost it will certainly be TLC. This album is more than a masterpiece this is one of those one of a kind albums uhat standout from the rest.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love this book.  Finished first book and then the movie came out to general public.  Saw the movie and liked it, but the book was so much better.  Great reading material that is all consuming.  You'll love this one!
B0056JJY2K|5.0|This is a great movie if you like strong men that don't back down from adversity.  It an old movie that I have seen many times before.  Watch it if you need a pick me up, watching a good strong man that's not a bully, but won't back down from a fight.
B008VBYN80|5.0|fun fun fun can I say fun one more time lol. I like the graphics gives me something to do while waiting on my other games
B000002TQV|4.0|There are so many ways to describe this one of a kind album some may say classic or brillent well its not neither its a masterpiece and the bends album is a must have in any collection and if you are a fan of radiohead this album should be the first you pick up.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This movie had great characters and a wonderful story line. The title sounds a little odd but I quickly got in to the movie and was very entertained all the way through.  I would highly recommend seeing this movie.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I enjoyed the ongoing story, I read the trilogy in less than a week, it was so interesting. Grisham's character development and story telling abilities are awesome.
B0078XGJQQ|5.0|I have always considered myself to be a grateful person - as someone who knows how to use their manners and to know what a good life I have been blessed with - until I read this book!<br /><br />Gratitude is not just saying thank you for what you are physically given it's deeper than that  - far far deeper.  This book takes you on a journey of gratitude, thankfullness, blessedness; it takes you to a world of changes and that make you wonderfully gladful for everything and everyone who touches your life.<br /><br />The Magic is set out in simple day to day achievable reminders that are both both to do and thought provoking. If you are reading this blurb then you are ready for the changes - be prepared for when you open your heart to this book the changes are ASTOUNDING. - just ask my partner, my sister and my friends xxxxx<br /><br />Create your own evolution right now xxxx
B008EL4YX6|3.0|It's a nice, easy to understand puzzle game. Like Angry Birds, a reduced number of trials results in an increased score, however, it's number of tries in solving a puzzle rather than destroying stuff. Everything is more fixed than Angry Birds: there is no chance of an extra block falling within a single try but the exact same outcome will occur with an identical attempt.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book is great!  A good mixture of mystery, romance, history, and supernatural creatures.  The subtext speaks to how difficult it is for people to be ok with difference, and how our fears create beliefs that we adhere to despite evidence to the contrary.  The characters are well developed, and it is wonderful to read a book that has a strong female character.  I loved it.
B005USZML4|5.0|I enjoyed the ongoing story, I read the trilogy in less than a week, it was so interesting. Grisham's character development and story telling abilities are awesome.
B005IGZW0Y|4.0|Gave an historical context to the TV serial of the same name.<br />Made the serial more understandable.<br />Brought to my attention details of history that I was unaware of.<br />Highly readable.<br />Would definitely recommend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book leaves nothing to the imagination.<br />It is very well written and puts you right in there.<br />It has also improved sex.
B004H4XAXO|5.0|To be honest, I wasn't so keen on the first 2 books. I honestly preferred The Name of the Wind. But that said, I really loved this book. I loved how it brought all the stories together and tied it up neatly. It made sense, in a sad sort of way, but some of the best stories are slightly tragic with a ray of hope at the end.<br /><br />I felt bad that just when things were getting good with the main characters, the story ended, and I couldn't read more about them. I would have really liked to see what their lives would have been like, because the arguments made and the relationship in this book seems to be based on truth. I mean \\"happily ever other\\" doesn't frankly cut it quite well, but it would have been really interesting to see what kind of life and relationship the author would have imagined those two characters to have in the long-term. By this I mean post-honeymoon period, where relationships are always nice and dandy and usually end up being \\"happily ever after\\". Still, good book. Worth reading all 3 for this conclusion, which was really well tied up. Thanks for making insignificant characters more interesting!
B008602KQI|2.0|This movie missed it on several levels,,1. The haves and the have nots,,2. Mixing children teens and preteens, and finally 3. Children KILLING children for entertainment
B008EQIK90|5.0|We rented this movie one night and I'm glad we did.  It was very funny. Very well written, acted and directed.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I thought it tracked well with the book acting was professional and good.  I am glad I watched and found it enjoyable.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|I must admit that I am new to comics. However,  after reading about the New 52 lineup from DC Comics,  I thought this would be a good way to start. I was trying to find a new Batman fix after seeing The Dark Knight Rises (knowing that this would be the last one directed by Christopher Nolan). I wanted a story that focused on Batman's vulnerability (he is just a man who trained himself to be a hero. He has no super powers at all.).  Well, rest assured that Batman: The Court of Owls does the Batman mythos proud.  He is dark, brooding,  determined,  and at times, vulnerable. What this story does better than any other story arch before it is that it puts Batman as a detective at the forefront.  There are a series of grizzly murders in Gotham that Batman must figure out and solve. However, the deeper he looks into the murders, the more he realizes he is connected to them in more ways than one. Imagine Batman envisioned by David Fincher,  and you would have a good idea of what to expect. Beautifully told,  cutting edge artwork, and fully realized ambition make this a Batman tale of the highest order. It will be held in the same esteem as The Dark Knight (by Frank Miller)  and The Long Halloween (by Jeph Loeb). It is THAT GOOD!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app friends! Very intuitive and accurate. Can't imagine how you could make it better but still look forward to the next update. BRAVO!...LOU
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is amazing!!  I heard so many different things about this book but I am glad I read it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!
B007SGM084|4.0|I read all three books and found them entertaining.  I certainly learned things about sex I didn't know or only suspected!!  However, the story kept me interested beyond the sexual parts we all hear about.  It's a tried-and-true formula - girl meets boy, falls in love, marriage, and work out the problems of getting to know one another.  But the details and life style made me want to know what was going to happen next.  I found the third book a little long.  Maybe some of the epilogue could have been cut; but overall I would recommend the three books as a good read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|this book is a page turner.  it makes you think about your personal marriage and what you could do to make it better
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You need this book if you do not have a Christian Grey at home.  It is the most descriptive book I've read in a years.  It was like watching live porn yet so sexy and satisfying.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book, puts you on the edge of your seat and never lets you down. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Watched the first season of Sons of Anarchy about a month ago and was instantly hooked! Watched all four seasons and cant wait for the fifth! Season 4 was just as interesting and action packed as all the other seasons. Having it online to watch was easy and simple. I was able to watch it on the computer and tv screen and it was just as clear as it would be on dvd or cable. I would definitely recommend this show to anyone looking to watch a combination of suspense, action, romance, and just plain ol' greatness!
B001ADQXHA|5.0|One of the classics.. I highly recommend this album to anyone and everyone. Almost every song on this album is amazing. It will definitely get you rocking out
0547569653|5.0|More than a book, it is a excellent  and inspiring source of who wants to achieve some goals.<br />Fascinating and Inspiring. I would not be able to run my first 40 km trail run without it.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Every song is great! A classic sound with a modern twist. If you like their two singles \\"We Are Young\\" and \\"Some Nights\\" you are going to like the rest of the album!
B00846REIS|3.0|Not as good as 50 Shades, but a nice break from reality and the stress of life!  It's definitely a \\"no brainer\\" book, meaning no intense thought needs to be present when  you read this book.  Just a fun read.
B002W5UVSM|5.0|This is a delicious read, and I'm glad that I purchased this for my kindle because I will read it again and again. Ignatius gets me sooooo angry but I laugh also when I remember how insane he is...belly busting, laughing out loud kinda book. Loved it
B0047Y17P2|3.0|If you don't have any thing else to and to pass the time this is a ok read. Too obvious that I predicted the end and to my surprise was exactly I thought. I like Connelly books but this is not one of them.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I like watching Julia Roberts be the evil Queen. I was a fun to see the snow white story with a different look.
B000E1155O|5.0|after tried to buy this album in lp, the option of cd it's the only one<br />but the songs are beautifuls, minimums and melancolics<br />thanks to Mr. John Mascis to release this hidden masterpiece
B008BIZ06M|3.0|NOT their best album by far, but still a couple of good tracks, mainly the title track. I really hope \\"bumpin' in my trunk\\" is some kind of joke, because that one's just terrible.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the first two books and the third one is really good! Shows the love they have for each other!!!! Love Christian Grey and Anna!!!
B000VZUM5C|5.0|WELL DONE FROM THE FIRST CUT THROUGH THE<br />ENTIRE SET.  AI NO CORRIDA IS A GREAT INTRO CUT FOR THE ALBUM. FOLLOW THIS BY THE DUDE.  GREAT!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Iam 74 years old.  I read a lot.  My Sunday School students (age 12) kept saying how great this book was, so I wanted to see for myself.  I borrowed the first 2 books.  They kept me in supence, and after I finished the second one I couldn't wait to read the third  . In five minutes after I ordered it from Amazon ,I was reading it on my Kindle.  Iwas not disappointed: I loved the book , and I would highly recomend it to everyone.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is seriously THE best movie of the year.  I never buy movies...I usually watch them one time and that's it.  I've watched it 4 times in two weeks.  Can't wait for the next one!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|In the the 3rd book of the Hunger Game series I didn't feel as glued to the book as I had with Hunger Games & Catching Fire. It wasn't as quick as a read for me and parts of it seemed to drag...<br /><br />That said, I was completely hooked into the series, there was no way I couldn't find out how it all ended. By the end I wasn't let down or anything - MockingJay was overall a great story on its own, but just in comparing it to its predecessors, it fell a bit short IMHO.  Worth the read if you've liked the series so far.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love the convoluted and lengthy story lines, adore the strong characters, and cheer them on from book to book. I hope Mr. Martin never stops writing!
B008602KQI|5.0|Inatanr streaming was a little glitchy, it needed to buffer a few times throughout, which hasn't happened with other instants I watched.
B007X15GRQ|1.0|My wife and I were not impressed.....it did not hold our attention.  I guess there's a reason you never heard anything about this movie when it was in theaters.  The trailer was better than the movie.
B0087URXZU|5.0|I'm sure there are reviews that have more recommendations than mine will get.<br /><br />I love it. it's great. A-ok. Tops. Numero uno.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|i liked it . but i didn't feel it was as good as all the build up was about it
0385751532|1.0|I was very disappointed in the book.  It was completely contrived and I cannot believe that the story is told through the eyes of a 9 year old .. more like a 4 year old. I kept wondering if the boy was mentally challenged. This book, I guess because of the subject matter is for young teens ages 12 and up.  By the time most students are 12 years old or in the eighth grade they have already read Anne Frank's Diary and many of them have read Night. In California, some of them have already gone to the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC so I really think this book is simplistic where it does not need to be.  I realize that so many people loved this book but I honestly cannot understand why.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Haveing seen the movie I had to read it. I did not stop reading it after a few chapters which is my test. I felt young people would get some terrible advice from the Lord Henry.  I feel that some of that part got boreing and skiped thru some of it. It is a classic and is well worth the read.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The little blurb given to you by the author was enough to entrance me into buying the book, and I do not for one second regret the purchase. From the very start of the book, the whole thing seems so mysterious and I couldn't put it down because I wanted to know the answers to all of the questions. The story unfolds so well, and it truly is magical the way Morgensten plays out the story. I wanted to know all the details about each of the characters exposed and when I was so sucked in by one character the chapter would end and the next character would be up. Then I would get sucked in by that character, and it just leaves you wanting more and more. The ending was nothing how I expected (mostly because I had no idea what to expect at all) and left me wanting to know even more about how it continues. Overall, I loved it.
B003MXAOVM|5.0|The story to abolish slavery and the sacrifice by Wilberforce is amazing. To see his story put to life was great. Nothing bad to say.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This book was great!  It is not the best written story ever, but it had a good plot twist and likable characters.  I enjoyed it!
0345803493|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect from this book, but once I began reading it I didn't want to put it down. If you are easily offended by graphic and explicit sex, this book isn't for you. It is well written, and really puts you in the mind of the character. It even throws in humor that was unexpected.
B006VRLNV6|5.0|Two great discs, but the second disc makes this an excellent album. Hearing Jimmy talking between takes is great to listen to and Jimmy's voice sounds so strong!  Great buy!
B0086700CM|5.0|I've had this game for a few days now &amp; had its very fun, challenging &amp; addictive. It's always fun to see if you can get a higher score!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Enjoyable could use less 3 syllable words that I have to look up every page<br />Enough with the sex, got old<br />But everyone would love a christian Grey in their life, I would
0345803493|5.0|It had a good balance of erotica, romance and suspense. This was my favorite book in the trilogy. I really enjoyed it!
B000B8QG0O|5.0|Fast Shipping! The product was received in excellent condition! My 2 yr. old son has already watched this movie half a dozen times! Thanks, again, for the great product and fast shipping!
B008602KQI|5.0|We love everything about the movie. We love all the extra scenes it came with this DVDs as well. It gave us more insight to the characters and the story itself.
B005SAV9SO|1.0|It seemed like the writer was too dumb to realize that they came off as racist.  Pounding kids with dodgeballs is not an amazing step up from showing movies.  Just seemed like the producer has a breast fetish and that is it.  Didn't give the woman from the office's character any purpose.  Timberlake's acting skills were wasted on an useless dry-hump scene.  Is the point of this movie that Diaz is sexy when there is water splashing her?  Why is the school board guy backing down due to a couple of half-nude shots that seem to be taken when he was drugged?  That would further his case.  Couldn't Amy just put calamine lotion on the poison ivy- which is btw pink, not brown.  HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.  DON'T BUY THIS-it is not worth $10.  I thought it might be a poignant satire of some of the abuses in the American school system.  Instead I saw Diaz's breasts, Amy's breast, National Geographic breast's, some random plastic surgery breasts, etc.  Some boob-fetishist pervert wanted an excuse to look at a lot of breasts and pretended to make a movie.  Should of just gone into porn.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|The Kingmaker's Daughter is an excellent addition to the Cousin's War series!  I felt as if I were there and that I knew the historical characters personally.  I love Philippa Gregory's historical novels.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Now throught the 3td book and I am still hooked, although I must say that at one point I wanted to throw the book.  The twists & turns keep you on your toes and you never know what will happen next.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|downloaded it for my phone and my kindle. It is a terrible app on both devices. Never works properly and is NOT User friendly. I don't recommend it. Spend the 3 or 4 bucks and get something else.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A book I could not put down.  Read it in two days.  Awesome book but I didn't like the ending!
B000YAX3P0|5.0|Amy had the \\"touch\\" for bringing the common life into beauty. Her musicality is unmatched and her soul really flys in this effort.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Slight slippage, perhaps a matter of sophomore success, perhaps of alliance with television.  Still, the first book was real; the second slides into magic.  I'm now reading the third, and it is weak.  More to go, and never read a review without understanding the reviewer.  To now, though, a good start seems to be fading.
B008FWHGYS|3.0|I rented this movie with no prior knowledge about it...just wanted to take a chance on it since Amazon is providing these movies before they're in the theaters.  Got it based on the names of the actors in it.  It was actually pretty good.  A little slow moving in places, but liked how the story went 360.  There were some subtitles to read, but not too many.  I thought it was interesting and could lead to some good discussions after the movie.[[ASIN:B008FWHGYS 360 (Theatrical Rental)]]
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have only played this game long enough to realize that it offers<br />a fantastic way to spend your time when you have nothing else you<br />can do.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I tried something that I hadn't before - jumping into the book series after seeing the movie. Since the movie was better than I expected, I gave the book a shot (and skipped the first). This series isn't just a fad of my lil' sister, I really became immersed. It seems to be following tried and true patterns of series like Lord of the Rings - a good book on its own, but leading you to more. Looking forward to next week's read!
B002PNAY9C|5.0|Christopher Paolini is just such a remarkable writer... especially to be so young when he started.  I'm ready for Hollywood to get these movies out for my viewing pleasure!!
B000XCHQFC|4.0|Fun movie for kids and adults. I enjoyed the original Short Circuit so I had to have the sequel.<br />Liked the first one better, but this was entertaining and my grandson liked all the robots.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book.  I can't wait for the next one.  Very well written.  Good story that needs a Book #2<br />If you already read 50 Shades, you will find this book similar but written by someone who knows how to write.  Even if you don't like it the frisky parts hold your attention!
B007JMW46U|5.0|The short stories are really fun and engaging to read and give the reader a sense of history since written in the late 1800's.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Brilliant and inspirational.  I don't think I'll go full vegan but will take away the stories and recipes for sure. Great book
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|Disney - always a winner. My 3yr old grandson absolutely loves this movie. The music and songs were fantastic.<br />And it was wonderful to see a \\"Disney Princess\\" without a tiara :) Keep up the great movie making.
B006RUJST6|5.0|It was short but it kept me interested right through! If a book get slow I end up putting it down and not picking it back up, not the case here.
B004EAQNO4|4.0|This was not a groundbreaking movie as people tend to expect from M. Knight..but it was creepy and engaging. If you aren't picky but don't want to watch pointless gore and screams in your horror films this is probably more to your taste.
B003B02OOG|4.0|Perfect \\"summer\\" reading-short stories with usual Grisham flair. Enjoyed each selection but there were not enough of them. Ideal for Kindle users.
B006VRLNV6|5.0|I had forgotten how hauntingly beautiful Jim Morrison's voice was and remains today remastered brilliantly. Kruger Manzerick et al...wort a listen!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks really knows how to get you roped in! This book is both thrilling and heart warming all in the same chapter, highly suggest this read!
B008602KQI|5.0|A film for all ages. Once you enter Katniss's world you you'll find yourself drawn in to the strength and innate goodness of the character, and a few fellow friends along the way (Peeta, Rue). There is a lot of cruelty and barbarity in this world, but Katniss and Peeta are true heroes to root for.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have to admit, I am no great writer or editor. I am an amateur. However, even I can spot a book that is so poorly written that's it's laughable. The only reason I gave it three stars is because the next two books are even worse.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I adore all the characters in this show. I think the casting was perfect for each character and the writing for each character is the best on TV today. Very few shows can explore so many facets of each character, and do it so well.  Finally, the actors and actresses have developed the personalities of these characters into people that I wish I knew. Good job Vampire Diaries!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the first book very much and was not disappointed with the 2nd. I read it in about 3 days, couldn't put it down!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I love this box set! So pretty on the outside and classic girl time on the inside. Delivered very quickly and in perfect condition.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was instantly engrossed from the beginning and found \\"Gone Girl\\" a well written, and enjoyable read.  I also felt that it was a weak ending, as if the last few chapters were written in a rush.  I plan to read more by this author
B008602KQI|5.0|I absolutely love The Hunger Games.<br />The Blu Ray copy was fantastic, although I did find the extras a bit lacking, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.<br /><br />(Also the books).
B005LMEB8E|5.0|I love this album so much. When I got it I just couldn't help but listen to it over and over again. Her new sound is amazing. If anyone is contemplating about getting this don't think for a second longer get it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I only bought the next two books to finish the story... If you can call it that. The only reason this book is popular is for kids to read about strange sex.  Used two sentence emails back and forth to fill space because the acual story would take one book to tell not three... Youre welcome for my $30.00!
B002DTRV4E|5.0|Brings me up and takes me back... classic selection of NY hits in live performance.  A talent too irrepressible for even the likes of CSN to absorb.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I was apprehensive at first, but it did not lake me long to be intrigued by this story line. I enjoyed all 3 books, I felt the author knew just how to write a novel to suit women down to the 't'. The only thing missing was chocolate! A fairytale for big girls. Enjoy the read.
B007SNYQFC|5.0|Ridley Person holds your interest right from the start.  Lou Boldt is an interesting lead character, with many great characters to interact with.  Hoping for more books in the Boldt/Matthews series.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I adore Craig Ferguson - truly, and I don't say that lightly.  His wit, intelligence and warmth, coupled as they are with an utter lack of pretense or conceit, make him irresistible.  I love his tv show and enjoyed the book immensely.  I really can't say enough about my appreciation for the straightforward way he addresses his past struggles and admits to his current ones. In short, if you're a Craig Ferguson fan, you won't be disappointed by the book, and if you aren't one, that will change long before the memoir ends; I can't recommend it highly enough.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really loved the movie. It is a Great adaptation of the book. I am looking forward to the next movie.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|A good bit of info..would like a little more detail..but pretty good for a quick overall look at the weather.
B008602KQI|5.0|A fascinating first installment film of one of the most entertaining trilogy of in post modern literature.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and look forward to the next two.  Brilliant!
B008476HBM|4.0|Good story but quite difficult to read. The dialect seems archaic and hard to follow many times. If one can interpret the dialect, the story is charming.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|After reading the books I was looking forward to seeing the movie. I was disappointed. I didn't like the casting of the movie specifically Catniss. There was also a lack of character development and story line. The movie was just to rushed. I know it would be hard to get everything in the movie that was in the book but dam. I will no be seeing the sequel or at least I will not pay to see the sequel.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great set of extra features, love the movie. No ability to watch it with commentary, dunno if that option is only on the blue ray, or if they simply didn't make it.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|An amazing surviving story. But most importantly a true life lesson. A girl who lost her freedom, yet so positive about life, so willing to live her future and not get stuck in her past.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|This is one of my most rewatched movies. I really enjoy the fast moving story line and the far reaching settings. It makes the movie seam so much more expansive. Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeifer are outstanding in their respective roles.
B008XG1X18|5.0|better than trying to use the mobile site. I kept getting fed up with the mobile site because it wouldn't load more pins, would skip around on the page and sometimes not let me repin, but this app fixes all those problems.
B008602KQI|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book-could not wait to read the rest in the trilogy. It was a great read from the beginning to the end.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i throughly enjoyed this trilogy of books.i read cover to cover very well written books.I hope they consider making a movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|EXCELLENT BOOK, I READ ALL 3. THERE COULD HAVE BEEN LESS SEX AND MORE OF A STORY LINE. OVERALL A GOOD BOOK. WAITING TO SEE IF A 4TH BOOK COMES OUT.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Fantastic!  Just as wonderful as the first two!!  I can't wait to get to the fourth.  Just when I think I have figured out what will happen with a character I am blown away by what happens!  I recommend this whole series to everyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was skeptical but the plot is strong and quickly overshadows the porn.  It's a very moving story that goes way beyond the sex.  Book 2 is even better!
B001NLL8LA|4.0|This is the 3rd book in the Reacher series.  I truly enjoy the \\"lone wolf\\" type of character.  Lee Child does a good job of developing this particular  character.  Would definately recommend this book and others in the series.
B005HEXQN2|5.0|The Star Trek series are always done in good taste.  They don't digress to foul language, unnecessary sex, or extreme violence.  The viewer can always be assured of an interesting plot and that good principles will always triumph. The characters are realistic and the story lines usually fun.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|When i have a stressful day and get home, get into my clean sheets turn up the volume and it simply relaxes me right into my sleep mode with hesitations.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is an amazing app. I simply love it! I can pick whatever sounds I want to hear, and then fall asleep listening to soothing, relaxing sounds. I don't know how I slept without it. It really is wonderful.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|ME AND MY GRANDCHILDREN ALL LIKE THIS GAME WHEN THEY COME IT KEEPS THEM BUSY AND OUT OF MY HAIR SO I LOVE THAT [PS JUST KIDING]
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie, very entertaining, should read books first.<br />Love having this on the cloud no more where is the disk.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book... I don't even want to say much about it, lest I diminish one whit of discovery, painful recognition, and sheer joy over its painstaking execution.  This is an expertise in storytelling -- and respect for readers -- far, far, far beyond most writing today.  No exaggeration: This book was so good that I couldn't bear to pick up another book for weeks -- so fearful I was of ruining my recollection of its modest genius -- the taste in the mouth of my mind and heart -- and not finding anything that might match it.  It's not just the story itself that's masterful; it's the way Flynn weaves throughout her dead-on observations of male-female interactions.  I was in simple awe that one person could so well understand both sexes.  I believe it was C.S. Lewis who taught, \\"Only when you can articulate something for others, can you be confident of fully understanding it yourself.\\"  Put that together with the adage, \\"Intelligence is the ability to hold (and articulate?) two distinct ideas simultaneously,\\" and you have an inkling of Ms. Flynn's broad mind, sympathetic heart -- and dangerous depth-perception. One human being shouldn't know so much!  (Honestly, I would be both thrilled and scared out of my mind to know someone like Gillian Flynn personally.  To be understood that well by another person, before even explaining oneself?  That too-nigh approaches something daemonic or God-like.)<br /><br />Get this book, and don't put it down even when you hate how well it describes your inner life, your partner's, and also today's Western culture.  The story itself will keep you stay around.  But great will be your reward (beyond the good yarn) if you pause often when reading, and join Ms. Flynn in reflecting on the nature of attraction, relationship and pop life.  It's a page turner -- but deliberately turn the pages slowly.  Enjoy this rich meal of writing in the guise of an tightly-woven mystery.
B0088WGBC8|5.0|This was an incredible action movie that held great suspense as well.  I would recommend anyone who likes action and good acting to watch this.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Ok, I'm 16 which is probably way too old to read these books, but I swear these are my favorites!
B003V5ED7W|4.0|This was our first experience with Amazon Instant Video and we would recommend it to anyone. The movie was fun and family-friendly and streamed seamlessly from the internet.
