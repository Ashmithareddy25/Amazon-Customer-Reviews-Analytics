0330412744|5.0|Okay: This is more of a relaxed and fun novel than, say, \\"Libra,\\" [[ASIN:0140156046 Libra (Contemporary American Fiction)]]or \\"Underworld\\" [[ASIN:0684848155 Underworld: A Novel]]by Delillo, but few can match the heights (and depths) those novels plumbed. This is more a sprint than a marathon, or, if you will, like a great chef making a hamburger. Those who criticized it would probably have hailed it as a masterpiece if it had come from the pen of an unknown writer. This guy can write, and he is always relevant and always enlightening. This would seem to be the ideal Delillo to be made into a film, for, like Ulysses, its plot spans precisely one day, and it has cinematic elements. Definitely recommended.
B0000669JL|5.0|I had this CD before so I knew what I was getting.  Great delivery!
B000I0RNV6|5.0|Before watching this on DVD just now, I had not seen director/screenwriter Giuseppe Tornatore's internationally renowned hit movie - at least the 123-minute version - since its initial 1990 release in the U.S., but I remember having mixed feelings that ran the gamut between being moved by its genuine poignancy and being resentful about what I felt at the time was its shameless heartstring tugging. Nearly two decades later, as I have gotten older and closer to the adult Salvatore's age, I have softened considerably in my opinion of the film, an open-hearted tribute to cinema and its transcendent impact on people's lives. Granted it is awash in sentimentality, but with its unique combination of storytelling elements inspired in equal parts by Chaplin and Fellini, there is a burnished, nostalgic glow to the whole venture as most of it is designed as a flashback.<br /><br />The plot begins with Salvatore ensconced in middle age as a successful film director based in Rome. Unexpectedly, he makes plans to return to his hometown in Sicily for the first time in almost thirty years. The reason is two-fold: the funeral of Alfredo, the projectionist who first introduced Salvatore to films, and the demolition of the Cinema Paradiso theater where they showed films to the enthusiastic denizens every Saturday night. This triggers memories of Salvatore's childhood at the old theater with Alfredo and then his adolescence and young adulthood when he falls in love with a beautiful local girl named Elena. In true [[ASIN:0743477111 Romeo and Juliet]] fashion, he is separated from his one true love by her disapproving father, a wealthy banker, and I have to admit this is the part of the film I still find a bit predictable with Tornatore's Baroque sense of romanticism in high gear. The scenes that really have enduring impact are those between the young, energetic Salvatore, nicknamed \\"Toto\\", and the surly but lovable Alfredo. Tornatore captures the magical bond between the two, including a tragic episode that forces them to reverse their roles in the projection room.<br /><br />Interestingly, the 174-minute version presented on the second disc of the 2006 two-DVD set fills in the blanks about Elena's fate. The older Salvatore is reunited with Elena and finds out the truth behind their separation. While I enjoyed and appreciated the longer director's cut, I feel overall the additional scenes don't add as much dimension to the story as the nearly three-hour running time warrants. I think my preference for the heartwarming Alfredo-Toto scenes gravitate me more toward the 123-minute version presented on the first disc. The central performances are memorable with the obvious standouts being Phillipe Noiret ([[ASIN:6305291403 Il Postino]]) as Alfredo and cherubic Salvatore Cascio as Toto. Looking like a Neapolitan Josh Hartnett, Marco Leonardi ([[ASIN:6305428476 Like Water for Chocolate]]) takes over as Toto and brings youthful, hormonally-driven fervor to the role, and Agnese Nano brings the requisite dreamy quality to Elena.<br /><br />As the older Salvatore, Jacques Perrin ([[ASIN:B00005JKIF Z]], [[ASIN:B000062XI7 The Young Girls of Rochefort]]) bears so little resemblance to his younger counterparts that his performance feels somewhat removed. In the longer version, his performance resonates more, especially as he shares the screen with Brigitte Fossey ([[ASIN:B000BC8SWE Forbidden Games]]) as the older Elena. The famous screening room ending is in both versions - the showing of Alfredo's gift to Salvatore, a reel of film clips highlighting kissing scenes excised by the local priest - though I find just as touching the theater demolition scene with the now-aged villagers looking on in a most resigned manner. Blasco Giurato's cinematography is stunning throughout, and enough cannot be said of Ennio Morricone's memorable music score, one of cinema's most beautiful in evoking the movies aura of romantic nostalgia.<br /><br />Beyond the director's cut of the movie, the 2006 Limited Collector's Edition DVD has several extras of note, the best being an informative, somewhat academic commentary track from Italian film historian Millicent Marcus interspersed with periodic personal recollections from Tornatore, as well as a fifteen-minute retrospective featurette, \\"Exploring a Timeless Classic\\". Of more anecdotal interest are a four-minute short on how Baltimore's Little Italy neighborhood has embraced the film with an annual outdoor showing encouraging more than a few romances; two theatrical trailers - the original and the director's cut released in 2002; and most inconsequentially, a Food Network show with Napa chef Michael Chiarello with recipes inspired by the movie.ctor's Edition DVD has several extras of note, the best being an informative, somewhat academic commentary track from Italian film historian Millicent Marcus interspersed with periodic personal recollections from Tornatore, as well as a fifteen-minute retrospective featurette, \\"Exploring a Timeless Classic\\".

0393327655|4.0|A concentration of books about atheism has been published in recent years. Perhaps this rush of counter-cultural sentiment shares its impetus with Sam Harris's purported reason for writing this book: the brutal destruction of the World Trade Center which ended thousands of lives, and continues to impact the health of anyone around to breathe the splinters of asbestos scattered as the towers burned and fell. Some people view world events in purely secular terms, believing that there are socio-economic reasons for everything, neatly leaving what many people consider to be the core of their motivations out of the equation. It's this finessed dance around the topic of religion's darker impact on society that Sam Harris aims to end, in order to bring the taboo subject into \\"the conversation,\\" as he often puts it.<br /><br />Where Richard Dawkins's \\"The God Delusion\\" amiably makes the case for science and reason, and Christopher Hitchens's \\"God is Not Great\\" elaborates on the absurdity of faith with graceful sarcasm, \\"The End of Faith\\" seems the most socially pragmatic, in that it begins with the problems of religion, and closes with alternatives to it. Unlike the previous two books which could leave an a believer or agnostic feeling lost in the wilderness, Harris tosses us a bone in proposing that things like meditation may actually be helpful, and that he hopes for a future (from a neurologist's perspective) that includes a \\"mature science of the mind,\\" which would aim to explore (and later utilize) the subjective experiences people have in a more systematic way.<br /><br />I recommend this book anyone on the fence about the rationality of religion in public affairs.
817224164X|5.0|Want to know what went on in the mind of one of the worlds most famous tirants? Then go ask him. Oh no you cant, so read this instead.  Its well written and shows a seriously twisted mind, and acts as a warning to what a twisted mind can achieve given the right circumstances and motivation.  Dont buy this if you expect a cheap jew-bashing novel, but do buy this if you think you can handle a well built up argument as to exactly why Hitler believed what he did.

B000VPUIA6|5.0|This has ALWAYS been my favorite Beatle movie.  Seeing it for the very first time brings back memories I shall cherish forever.    I remember my mom and I at a store one night, there was a drive-in a little ways down from it and it was a school night.  While driving to the store I got all excited because I saw that they were showing \\"HELP!\\".  I just went on and on about how I wanted to see it.  I was 11 and it was a school night.     While leaving the store and driving back home I turned myself around and kneeled on the carseat looking out the back window so I could see the screen while we past it, and then I fell over.  My mom had turned into the drive-in.  I looked at her in amazement and she said \\"shhh, just don't tell your father\\"......    I had to sit through Blue Hawaii with Elvis first so by the time \\"HELP!\\" started it was pretty late.    It was the first time I had seen The Beatles on a big screen.  I didn't like them when they premiered on Ed Sullivan in 64 but between \\"Yesterday\\" then seeing them on Ed Sullivan in 65 and now \\"HELP!\\" I have been a Beatles fan the rest of my life.    I have listened and had them in my life every single day since then.    I LOVE \\"HELP!\\" and could watch it over and over again.  I have been waiting so very long for 'Apple' to finally 'refurbish' this great movie.      I had taped it many years later when it came on tv and had an audio-tape and listened to it over and over and actually wrote the script from listening and stopping it so knowing every line, well it's welded into my memory.    I taped it on my Cartrivision in 1973, taped it on Beta, then bought it on Beta, VHS and when the DVD came out the first time in the early 90's.    Maybe NOW \\"The Fest For Beatles Fans\\" will finally show this wonderful, funny movie again.......I'll just have to wait to find out.    If your a 'true' Beatles' fan this is a must to have in your collection even if you already own it, if you've never seen it before, buy it you won't regret it.  And if you aren't a Beatles fan buy it and bring back the 60's and your youth, you'll be happy you did.    mcrtnyfan.com
0596527055|4.0|This is a really good read! It includes thoughts on how individuals spread innovation and how society determines the impact. Its rally is a myth busting book. He reinforces the \\"lucky or smart\\" comments from \\"Fooled by Randomness\\". Lots of great quotes . Steve Jobs, \\" real artists ship.\\" Dewey, \\" A problem, properly defined is partly solved\\". A very good discussion on what Osborn really meant in \\"Applied Imagination\\" when inventing brainstorming. He felt that an equal amount of time needed to be spent on facts, ideas and solutions, people were to quick to jump to a solution. Another takeaway, No one knows what's possible\\". Some parallels in Godin's rant on competence vs brilliance. i.e. Competent managers are scared to try anything new, since that threatens their competence. Great line on Frederick Taylor, he could have saved himself hours and hours of studies if he had asked the workers where the process was inefficient.
B000PFU9GA|5.0|Compared to what I paid for this individually, this is a steal. I LOVE this series. I was a fan from eppisode 1. I had to hunt this set down piece by piece a few years ago. Having it all together like this would have been really nice. This is absolutely a gift that keeps on giving.
1594489505|4.0|This was a wonderful novel, heartbreaking and painful much of the time but still a story of hope in a brutal world. It slowed down a bit toward the end (after Miriam is with the Taliban -- I won't say more than that as don't want to give too much away). In that last portion of the book, it felt like I was being told what happened rather than experiencing what happened. But the ending itself left me satisfied. It also made me wonder what will happen to the real Miriams and Lailas in Afghanistan in the years to come. Will the Taliban return to power? Will women once again be beaten for leaving the house without a male relative?<br /><br />I listened to the unabridged audio of this book, read by a woman with (what sounded to me like) an authentic Afghan accent so it really made me feel as if I were right there with Miriam and Laila.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
0143058525|5.0|This was a rare gift to give myself. Usually I purchase books that require something of me, reflection, change of attitude, meditation or a stronger effort to make the right choices in life.  Eat Pray and Love was recommended by a dear friend who said, just get it and listen to it.  I didn't realize how much I needed to laugh, cry and be reminded of how many commonalities we all share rather than the perceived canyons of differences. I have enjoyed this set of audios more than any other for the simple reason I found parts of my life in her stories and was absolved through cascades of laughter.  Dr. Lee StJohn
0375505091|4.0|I was surprised at the size of this book! It is much thicker and larger than what I thought and I think it is good value for money. It provides the reader with an insight into the photographer's life and gives the book a very intimate feel. Not all the pictures are flattering to Ms Leibovitz and her relatives and seeing these ordinary photos of people not looking at their best makes you feel as if you are looking at people that you also know. An interesting mix of photos of celebrities and everyday people is presented.    One point of critisizm - why do they print a good photo over two pages and then cut it in half by the page break? A good picture deserves to be printed on one page so as to see it as a whole.

0671024256|5.0|In his novel, On Writing, King not only allows the reader to delve into the depths of his wonderful mind when it comes to writing, but he also provides superb insight on how to be a writer. It is a warm and inviting novel. His words are simplistic and his rules easy to follow. King does not fill his novel with tiresome tips and conformist ideas; he encourages the reader to indulge in the creative mind. Most of all he encourages his readers to write, it is a simple as that.          King starts out his novel by telling about his childhood through his adult years. King's narrative goes through the twists and turns of his life telling different stories about his constant moving habits, his sickly nature, his less than mundane family, and his first successes with writing. Now till this point in the book, King carefully recaptures his experience with writing. In the next part, King turns the tables and gives the readers his general overview in how to write. He is vigilant in including his audience in all points in this part of the novel. He even gives them exercises to get their creative impulses flowing. King does not try to trick the reader into believing what he believes or writing the way he writes. He does not try to lead on the reader with elaborate ideas about writing. He states everything in his book plain and basic. King then does one more turn and combines the element of writing and his life. He writes about how writing has helped him cope with his unfortunate accident in 1999.          On Writing is a magnificent novel, and King definitely proves to the reader that he is a true Writer. His heart, wit, and soul are in this novel, and this is what makes it a great read for anyone who is interested in the writing process or is interested in King himself. It is informational and entertaining at the same time. It is a book no one will want to put down, and it will be one that readers remember for all time.
0151013047|3.0|The language in this novella is fluid; it is a short piece (framed as a tale told over a dinner) that pulls in the reader. The narrator (Changez) spins his story of his initial embrace and ultimate rejection of the upwardly mobile existence of a Pakistani-born Princeton alum living in corporate America post-9/11. The book tries to answer big questions about why America both attracts and repels the alien observer in the early 21st century. It disappoints. The novel surfs instead of diving deep into motivations and milieu. The characters surrounding the narrator (a sad beautiful WASP love interest, a workplace mentor) are drawn sketchily. Is it because these Americans are ultimately unfathomable to Changez? Perhaps, but the characterization of the narrator, and his transformation, also remains oddly unspecific. There is a lack of detailed descriptions of either New York after 9/11 (which had a distinct feel) or Lahore. Changez watches Afghanistan being bombed, and tensions rising in South Asia, and he increasingly finds himself questioning his role in his adopted country. His disillusionment seems reasonable enough (we know from poll statistics the punishment that US image has taken globally in the last 6 years), but Hamid does not offer probing insight to the issue. The book would be strengthened by more particulars about the situation and attitudes of South Asian and Muslim immigrants to the US. Changez's transformation and radicalization comes so quickly. The novel's conclusion offers an intriguing ambiguity.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|A disappointment. Being a diehard Bruce-fan, I expected a lot more than this. The album suffers from a murky and muddy production, it feels like the E Street Band is playing in a closet. Mighty Max sounds like Ringo Starr's puddingsound (when Max sounds produced by Jeff Lynne, then we got a serious problem). Bittan & Federici can't really be detected. You can hear them here and there, but not in their personal way/style. And I'm not saying E Street of 2007 needs to sound like 1978. But it might as well be studio musicians playing here. O'Briens production feels boringly mature, no risks are taken and that puts a straitjacket on the songs. There's no albumfeel, just 12 individual songs without any real ties between them (the 12th is \\"Terry's song\\", to Terry MacGovern). Every song stands on its own, production- and arrangementwise. Half of the songs are less than 4 minutes long, which many of them suffer from: they should have been allowed to continue and develop, more flowing music and saxophone, more soul less editing. Sometimes the fadeouts are technically bad, as well. Furthermore, the songwriting isn't top quality. I love Radio nowhere, You'll be coming down, the beautiful Your own worst enemy and the Beach Boyish Girls in their summer clothes, with one of the most haunting melodies Bruce ever written and he sings it like a God. I think Last to die will grow a lot on me, but apart from this the titles and songs tend to make promises they can't keep. I'll work for your love is a kind of mature lovesong Bruce has written at least five times before and it sounds the same. Magic must be the most antititletrack I've heard, sounds like an outtake from Tom Joad or D&D. Livin' in the future has lyrics which are really beneath Bruce, reminds me more of Huey Lewis (the song is much better than the lyrics, the singing is great). Devil's arcade has a lovely title, but the song - like the album - lacks direction. A lot of the songs was obviously written from Bruce staccatoplaying technique on the acoustic guitar (see Storytellers), but the transfer to full band arrangement is rather bad. The separate parts of some of the songs aren't connected. It's obvious the E Street Band-members flew in separately and did their stuff. This is NOT a band album, but hopefully a lot of the songs will come to life on stage, being free from their albumlength and poor production. There really isn't that much magic here, I'm sorry to say. The better record in this marriage is actually Patti's. Bruce delivers some really nice melodies and vocal arrangements, but a lot of the songs lack good melodies. Is it writer's block or simply a bad choice of songs? I don't know. I'm sure the album will grow on all of us, but having listened to it 5-6 times this really isn't what I was hoping for.
080017948X|4.0|One interesting note: the movie doesn't say what causes this to happen to Phil.  However, an earlier version of the screenplay does.  In the beginning of the movie, after he gets the Groundhog Day assignment, he dumps his girlfriend.  What he doesn't know is that she dabbles in witchcraft, and so at home that night she performs an incantation that puts the hex on him.     Now for the thing to think about.  Don't get me wrong, I really like this movie.  But think about the philosophical implications.    Here we have a man who has to go through the same day over and over.  At 6 AM, everything in his life goes back to the way it was 24 hours ago.      But everything in the world is interconnected.  So that means that every person in the world would have to relive the same day over and over.  And every living thing--every animal and plant.  And every object in the world, every atom in the world, would have to shift back to the way it had been.  The Earth itself would have to go back to where it had been in its orbit.    Every single living being and every atom in the entire universe, and the entire universe itself, would have to revert back to the way it had been the day before, over and over again.    All so that this one man could learn to become a better person.    I mean, just how important is this guy, anyway?

B000HWXS2S|4.0|For those looking to corrupt your friends from 'normal' Heavy Metal to the darker side of Death Metal, this might be the perfect CD.  My background is that I used to like all kinds of music (except Rap and Country), then started liking Queensryche a lot, then got hooked on Metal of all kinds (except Death and Black).    My friend who hooked me on Metal, likes the heavier stuff, especially Death.  I listened to it a few times but it never grabbed me.  I didn't MIND it, as it became basically 'white noise' which worked fine as background music, but it wasn't anything I would have put into the CD player on my own.    Then I saw this CD in a Borders'.  Read a review of it on one of their various computers scattered around.  Almost bought it, didn't, and asked my friend to bring it over sometime.  Immediately on hearing it I knew I really liked the music.  The vocals, well, they didn't grab me but the odd thing was I could understand them (the first time that's really happened).    So I picked up the CD.  I still can't listen to it over and over, and usually it gets put into a mix, but I _do_ like it.  The melody of the guitars and drums workes very nicely, and the voice isn't too overpowering.  Plus, the lyrics, if you read them, are well done and evocative.  It only gets a 4 because I'm not very experienced in the genre and it's NOT one of my top 10 Metal CDs.  As a crossover (from normal to Death metal) CD though, it might just rate a 5.
B000F4RHB6|4.0|Before samplers, pitch correction and handlers kidnapped music and took it hostage to reality shows, stage parents and Paris Hilton albums, you could still form a band with your friends and get discovered the old fashioned way: By writing songs, woodshedding your act and getting discovered because crowds fell in love with you. Such is the case with Huey Lewis and The News. Fusing 80's new-wave energy to R'n'B pop/rock, they struck gold on their second album and then let off a barrage of feel-good hits that made them one of the biggest acts of the 80's. Having Huey Lewis as a frontman himself certainly didn't hurt, with square-jawed matinee idol good looks and an easy to like husky voice, he came across as a rock and roll everyman.<br /><br />That is just what this new version of Huey Lewis and The News' greatest hits serves up. Deservedly wiping the inadequate \\"[[ASIN:B000NDEXNO Time Flies: The Best of Huey Lewis & the News]]\\" off the table, this set spans all their major label gigs, the majority of their singles and some choice album cuts. All the top tens are here, including the inescapably catchy \\"Heart of Rock and Roll,\\" \\"Heart and Soul,\\" \\"The Power of Love\\" and \\"Hip to be Square.\\" These were polished professional songs all, the 80's equivalent to yuppie rock. That the videos were clever enough to appeal to parents helped, and they were just edgy enough (Lewis was one of the few 80's superstars to back out of playing Live Aid - even with his contribution \\"Trouble In Paradise\\" included here - and there were actually stations that refused to play \\"I Want a New Drug\\") to hold some rock cred.<br /><br />But the bottom line remains the music. The irony of a song like \\"Stuck With You\\" or \\"Couple Days Off\\" is that they maintain a bit of goofy innocence, the underlying message is that it really was hip to be square. Lionel Richie was singing \\"Stuck On You\\" about the same time, and his sappy ode was counter-weighted by Huey nonchalantly turning that sentiment sideways...\\"and your happy to be stuck with me...\\" These were populist songs, singing about love and work and being an average Joe. They deserved their place on the radio and MTV, and despite the occasional slagging that rock snobs dumped on great albums like \\"[[ASIN:B000008HPE Fore!]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:B00000JCFP Sports]],\\" these pop songs sound better than ever.<br /><br />Quibbles: I miss \\"Bad is Bad,\\" \\"Small World,\\" \\"Give Me The Keys\\" and \\"Hit Me Like a Hammer.\\" And couldn't someone had found room for one song from the \\"[[ASIN:B00005MJY0 Plan B]]\\" reunion album? I guess that would have necessitated a double CD, but I think I'd have been willing. Don't let that stop you, though.

B000PFUA9G|5.0|At a time when Nashville stars seem increasingly too-perfect and phony, singer-guitarist Brad Paisley makes twangy music that sounds like a real-live human being made it, even a guy you might like to hang out with and shoot the breeze. Plus, he's obviously got something going on upstairs -- novelty songs like \\"Ticks\\" and \\"Still A Guy\\" don't just settle for a simple set-up and punchline: Paisley builds on his jokes and keeps topping himself with each line.  He's a funny guy, and he's also smart enough to keep the rough edges in the mix, along with some real country twang.  Tim McGraw makes me run to change the dial every time, but Paisley makes me want to kick back, pop open a brew and find out what comes next.  More power to him.  (DJ Joe Sixpack)

B000OONQ30|5.0|This is one of those events, whether musical or otherwise, that comes along once a generation.  The result is that everyone remembers where they were when....    In my case, I was pottering around at home, blissfully unaware of anything, when my Dad phoned me and said \\"Turn on your TV - three guys are singing beautifully.\\"   I did, and the rest is history.    I'm a professional musician and can't pull out bits or say where people were better than others.  Pavarotti was aureate and majestic, his great bulk filling the space, singing with his entire face....Jose Carreras wonderfully intense and sensitive, like the younger brother, keen to impress and seeking approval (later bravely to fight his own health battles)....and Domingo was mischievous and competitive.    Zubin Mehta held the whole event together brilliantly, part authoritative, part conspiratorial.  In the magical setting of Caracalla, the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.      It was the best jam session ever, and if you haven't seen it, you've been deprived.  If you have, you'll want it again.

It's a Mystery with a Social Message! :)    Something for everyone.
B000EGDAI4|5.0|This is one of the best ever Jazz albums, recorded by one of the top five tenor players in Jazz history.<br /><br />The other musicians are:<br />Tommy Flanagan - Piano<br />Doug Watkins - Bass<br />Max Roach - drums<br /><br />Even if you're not a Jazz fan you'll know Sonny Rollins 'St Thomas' which opens the album, with its calypso melody its one of the best known Jazz tunes. The performances are uniformly excellent and the sound is incredible since this album was recorded 50 years ago.<br /><br />The track 'Moritat' is in fact 'The theme from the three penny opera', but it sounds remarkably similar to 'Mack the Knife'. Whatever the tune really is, Rollins is never less throughly inventive, as anyone who has seen him live will testify to. This track perhaps contains the highlight of the album, where Sonny Rollins trades 4's with the sadly recently deceased Max Roach.<br /><br />This is one of the classic Jazz albums and should be in everyones collection.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Many beloved \\"Saturday Night Live\\" comic actors have tried to break out from pure comedy into more dramatic roles.  Dan Aykroyd (\\"Driving Miss Daisy\\"), Bill Murray (\\"Lost in Translation,\\" \\"Rushmore\\"), and even John Belushi (\\"Continental Divide\\") have proven that it can be done.  But it is undeniably a risk.    Therefore it is with kudos that we greet Will Ferrell's performance as Harold Crick, seriously unfunny IRS auditor, in Marc Forster's \\"Stranger than Fiction.\\"  Harold is obsessed with numbers, brushing each tooth an equal number of times every day, counting the number of steps it takes to make it to the same bus, etc.  Harold takes no vacation, and has no real friends.  His life is maddeningly static, and empty.  When Harold dies, his tombstone will have nothing more than his name and the only two significant dates of his life - birth and death.    And then one day, Harold starts hearing a voice in his head, narrating his life.  This is worrisome, but becomes downright frightening when the voice refers to Harold's impending demise.  The voice is of author Karen Eiffel (Emmma Thompson), a nerve-wracked, chain-smoking recluse, a gifted writer suffering through writer's block as she tries to figure out how to kill Harold.  The metaphysics of Karen writing a novel about a man who actually exists are never explained, but the set-up works regardless.    Harold, faced with impending doom, first seeks help from a shrink.  The shrink, stumped by Harold's delusions but grasping on to Harold's description of the voice \\"narrating\\" his story, tells him to seek out an expert in literary theory.  Enter Dustin Hoffman as Professor Jules Hibbert, who dismisses Harold until Harold says that the narrating voice uses the phrase, \\"little did he know.\\"  Jules is fascinated - \\"I've taught whole seminars on 'little did he know.'\\"      The story then turns to how Harold deals with his impending demise and learns to live his life again.  Enter Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a heavily-tattooed baker who is the subject of one of Harold's audits.  Harold is charmed by her, but has not the first clue how to go about pursuing this beauty.  The scenes with Ferrell and Gyllenhaal are not realistic (a tax-protesting free-spirit baker would never fall for this auditor, especially when his opening line is \\"I want you\\"), but the two actors handle their scenes with such care and tenderness that disbelief is suspended.  Their most charming scene involves Ana introducing Harold to his first home-baked cookies, and Ferrell is quite surprising.      \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" could have been played as broad slapstick, and indeed that is what I had expected.  But there is nothing along the lines of the \\"Baby Jesus\\" speech in \\"Talladega Nights\\" for madcap comedy here.  What comedy there is in this movie is quiet, calm, and heart-felt.  Strong performances fill out what could have been a mere trifle of a film, and Thompson and Ferrell particularly shine.      \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" is far from a laugh-out-loud comedy, but it has its comic moments.  It is an unconventional story about conventional people, and if its ultimate conclusions about living life to the fullest are pure vanilla, that doesn't mean that it isn't a delicious vanilla.  Just like a well-baked cookie.

B00005OM4N|3.0|This could well be Miss Spears' best album. Listening to tracks from this, its a pity that it all went downhill after this. The standout is obviously \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\", easily the best thing Britney has put to record. But there are other gems here as well.<br /><br />\\"Not a Girl, Not yet a Woman\\" is a tad sappy indeed, but it holds up well years later. The same cannot be said for the tired version of \\"I love Rock and Roll\\", which is beyond bad. However, for every sick track on this, there is a bonafide gem - \\"Lonely\\" and \\"Anticipating\\" are songs that make this record a must-have.<br /><br />The last three songs on the CD are what reduces it to a three star album. Typical of a Spears release, the tracks are pure filler and sound like they're from the early 1990s. Not a good thing.<br /><br />Still, for what its worth, this was the last Britney album that actually has some repeat value, so you might want to check it out for that novelty value.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|I saw GRINDHOUSE in the theatre. I'm not one of the fickled ADD movie going public. I am a fan of the genre. That said, I have to say that I'm truly disappointed that Tarrantino and Rodriguez backed down when releasing these the DVDs this way. It's a slap in the face to the people supported this thing from start to finish. If I'm given the choice to buy the movie in increments or not buy it all, I choose to remain 40 bucks richer.
0792164903|5.0|This was the first Tim Burton movie that I have ever watched before.  I saw it a couple of months ago.  I still remember it, so it made quite an impression on me.      The casting was impressive.  Not just the leading roles, but the supporting ones as well.  Johnny Depp's character was really eccentric in this movie.  It was such a huge change from his pirates movies.  I did not know if he could pull it off and be convincing or not.  He was, I'll admit.  Christina Ricci did an excellent job in this movie.  She has grown into a talented and underrated actress over the years.  The setting, the sets, and the period costumes were perfect.  The location chosen looked authentic and creepy.      However, the star of this movie was the score by Danny Elfman.  It is an essential part of the movie. It is a creepy heart pounding adventure that stands alone.  I liked the movie, but I absolutely loved the score.  I purchased it from Amazon the very next day.    I highly recommend that you purchase both this movie and the score from Amazon, before the Halloween rush. :)
B00005ASOI|3.0|While shopping for horror dvds, my favorite store had a sale on a bunch of movies. I picked this one up and it sounded like a great film. The movie starts off in a rain storm and in a creepy home. Then a murder which Entertainment Weekly called the most vicious murder scene ever filmed. Ive seen alot of films and I didnt think it was vicious. Then the movie kinda of drags on from there. It has a good atmosphere but never really delivers the goods. It was alright but I probably never will watch it again.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|This concert was breathtaking.  It was a flawless performance of the best combination of metal music and an orchestra that I had ever heard.  The music was written so well that you would have thought that they originally composed the music this way, rather than rewritten it for this concert.  It sounded so good that I have the double set of cds as well.  I hope that they do this again with their other music.  It gives it a whole new dimension.    I highly recommend this to not only Metallica fans but to fans of orchestra music as well.  It will definitely broaden your horizons.
B000F3T3CS|4.0|I agree with all the good comments here.  But am I the only one who finds that there's something wrong with the miking?  The recording mikes seem to be too far from the singers, so that the orchestra and soloists are sometimes out of balance.  I keep having to adjust the volume level.  Other than that, it's gorgeous...netrebko and villazon are wonderful...
B000VAPZM2|5.0|Both of my kids (Boy 3 and Girl 5) and all their friends absolutely loved this movie.  And if there is anything out there that can keep the attention of a 3 year old and 5 year old girl at the same time, I'd pick it up.  The dance scenes were great, the kids got up and moved and by the end of the movie all the kids (and adults) were singing and dancing along.

1416523359|3.0|I'll be blunt and brief, since I've got better things to do. King wrote a good love story here, not a horror story. The last good horror he wrote was way before his accident (though [[ASIN:0340952040 Cell]] comes close). It could have been much shorter and it really bothered me having to read \\"smucking\\" every page or so. Who really talks like that? Not that it would have been better for Lisey to curse, but smucking? Come on!<br /><br />A good book by a great author, but certainly not his best. His earlier work seems better (with the exception of his [[ASIN:0340830247 The Dark Tower]] series), more scary. Not that King is slipping in telling a story, but he should just quit tagging everything with \\"horror\\" on it, especially if it only has a few scares in it.
0385484518|5.0|Obviously this book doesn't need another review, but, for what it is worth, I liked it. It is a nice sentimental story, with some good advise and some believable people. Morrie was obviously a likable old man. I don't really agree with his philosophy entirely but my turn on that ride hasn't arrived yet. Maybe I'll change my tune when I get there. You really can't miss with this one.<br />If you enjoyed this book, you might also enjoy my book A SUMMER WITH CHARLIE [[ASIN:0979808561 A Summer with Charlie]]<br /><br />Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - author of:<br /><br />\\"A Summer with Charlie\\"
B000VK99Z6|5.0|I loved this movie.  Very original, very clever.  If you can't stand gore, there are a few parts of this film you may not like.  The satire is beautiful though.  It spoofs all the over-the-top police action-adventure movies like Lethal Weapon, Bad Boys, etc.  I haven't seen 'Shaun of the Dead' but that's the next movie I'm buying.  Highly recommended!
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Without giving away any of the movie ~ This is the Italion Job meets Four Brothers. Not only is the movie action packed from snipers to explosions, into Federal Agents kidnapped for a coverup on an inocent Shooter ~ all the while a sadistic \\"puppet master\\" pulling strings in different departments. This Movie EASILY rivials any of the Bourne ;)
1582701709|2.0|I gave it \\"2 stars\\" only because it was can be used as a \\"Cliff's Notes\\" for positive thinking.  Otherwise it seemed to be a compilation of other peoples' quotes and thoughts - a cheap way for Ms. Byrne to make a buck - correction - lots of bucks.  I feel like I used to when I was a kid and got ripped off by a carnie at the ring toss.
B000RG1FMO|2.0|I just really get irritated listening to this cat throw down the rhymes. Stronger has one of the best beats this side of Public Enemy, but the rhymes are dumb and don't make any sense. Referencing Prince and OJ in the same set of rhymes? Come on now, that is silly. It's more versatile than most garbage in the game today, but still kind of lame. I would love to see rappers like Kool G Rap and Paris be more relevant today. They were good rappers that wrote about things that made sense to me. I've liked rap for years and front my own rap group called Frisbee Frank and the cranky gerbils. We do a lot of covers of the people mentioned above plus covers of BDP, EPMD and the Fat Boys. We also write our own stuff like \\"Gimme some club crackers you crazy woman\\". It's the biggest hit in rural Nebraska right now.    Kanye is that bad which is pretty good but worse than the best that isn't too bad. He makes you dance some and think a minute or two about where your gas money is going. At the end of the day, he is average. I just booted average into the upper corner for another game winning goal.
B000V39KDO|2.0|This was truly a mediocre movie with some beautiful visual shots in it. Really did not even come close to living up to the hype though. A true dissapointment to me.
0765316889|4.0|This book is a slower, and larger instalment than the first book in this series.  Be warned, there's a lot of politics involved as Vin and Elend try to cope with solidifying their initial success with overthrowing The Final Empire - only to find that theory and reality don't always mix well, and other emerging Warlords and Kings don't particularly want Eland on the throne and will do anything to get him out of the way if it will help them find The Lord Ruler's fabled stash of atium.    This middle book by its end sets up the stakes for the final instalment in this series, and still makes me impatiently waiting to see how it will all end with book 3. It's a recommended read though the first half is a bit slow to start.
0316067598|5.0|This story gave all of us a very detailed picture of what is really going on!
B000RG1FMO|3.0|Everyone has the right to judge Kanye Wests rapping ability because his production is tight but that does not make Kanye West a good rapper. To be honest I been listening to Rap/Hip Hop for 25 years now and the man has very little rapping skills.
1577312082|5.0|So much of what we struggle with in life is due to the obvious which we either cannot, or refuse, to see.  The author does a remarkable job of making sense of how we unwittingly make our own lives much more difficult and painful, and showing how we can stop the insanity if we choose.    I began reading this book last year, as I was dealing with overwhelming losses and knew I needed help.  I had to stop part-way through, as the author began speaking in stronger terms about a larger force of which we are all a part.  My belief system doesn't quite go in that direction, and as a result, I turned away from the book.  I came back to it a year later however, determined to benefit from the wisdom I had previously seen, and which had convinced me that there was much more to come.  I am so glad I did.  I still struggle with the \\"we are all part of something bigger\\" concept, but practically everything else in the book has really helped.  I plan to slowly reread it many times in the remainder of my life, and have also gone on to buy the CD set for listening in my car.  It is incredibly grounding, any time I read or listen to any of it.    If you try it and it doesn't feel like the right thing at the right time for you, my suggestion is to just put it away for a while.  You'll know when the time is right for you to return to it; I hope you get as much from it as I have.
0142000663|5.0|If you haven't read The Grapes of Wrath, do yourself a huge favor and read it!!! Since it's that good, I can't think of any more words to describe it...
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I saw the movie and went home and IMMEDIATELY ordered the CD. I don't think I've listened to anything else since I got it! The movie is amazing, funny, and almost a love story. The music is performed by the stars in the movie and they are brillent. Set in Ireland; folk, rock, and classical. In real life he is in an Irish rock band, and she is a famous Polish pianist.
1592289444|5.0|What an amazing life.  I was expecting another \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\\" or \\"Gulag Archipelago.\\"  But this story is different -- there is very little bitterness, very little savoring-of-the-details.  Instead, it is cleanly told.  It is a simple book, not much complexity, just human nature laid bare.  Amazing.<br /><br />Human endurance amazes me.
0375703764|5.0|Really, I love this book. It is not the scariest book I've ever read because I was broken as a child of the habit of being scared by movies and books and such. I watched and read too much so I can't judge the scariness. All I know is that I love this book. No monsters, ghosts, ghouls, murderers, none of that, just a house. Thats all. For those of you who do scare I imagine that what is contained in this book might scare you. This is an innovative horror tale. I love it.
0765316889|5.0|Mistborn fans, do not start this book if you don't have a chunk of time to read it through.  The second of the series, Well of Ascension is very fast-paced with a lot of twists and turns, action, and new information.  There are detailed fight scenes which appealed to the teenage boys I've talked to, but I admit to loosing interest in following them too carefully. With the allomancy-magic they seemed almost Matrix like, only in print.  I did find myself pulled along by excellent character development, (of both new and returning characters,) and by the way the story evolves and changes. This is a large book to read in one sitting, but it is very compelling, and if you decide to wait till the action slows down a bit to take a break you will never put it down.  My only real disappointment with the book is that it does not have nearly as finished an ending as the first in the series, (it's pretty much a teaser for the next book,) but the boys insist that they really, really, so very much, liked the way it ended.  And, all of us agree, we are enthusiastically waiting the final volume.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I didn't rent this movie to jump on the global warming band wagon, just as someone with an open mind that likes to listen to current issues at hand.  I watched the movie hoping for fallacies or blatantly one sided opinions without counter-arguments but was hard pressed to find any.  Yes, Gore is passionate about this issue, yes, he might not be the MOST exciting/fun guy in the world, BUT he does bring to light some important issues to be thought about.  What I have the hardest time understanding is the people that are so openly against the possibility of global warming(Check out the one star reviews, most didn't watch the movie).  This is something very real to consider if you want to continue living on this planet.  Anyways, Gore does a great job presenting his point, and the DVD was well produced with enough varying scenes and themes to keep the audience interested.
0765350386|5.0|I am always pleased to find a great new author of fanatsy fiction.  What a thrill it was to find this book.  It came highly recommended by my teenage son and I was very pleased that it was such a great read.  It isn't very often that a fantasy author comes up with a world that feels so unique, filled with characters that are believable.  My son really likes the detail that Sanderson takes in describing how the magic system works, (it too, is very original.) I tend to find that sort of thing tedious as I am a more plot driven reader, but didn't find myself getting bogged down at all.  We have recommended the book to all our fantasy reading friends and it has been enjoyed by moms, dads, and teens alike all through our neighborhood.  A few reluctant readers got stalled out in the first chapter, which is better understood after getting farther into the book.  All in all, this is a great read that anyone fond of fantasy will enjoy.  (It was also refreshing to come to a satisfactory ending point even though this is the beginning of a trilogy.) What a score for the fantasy genre!
0140177396|5.0|Steinbeck writes beautiful prose in this very short book.   The story unravels rather quickly and the strong connection one feels with the characters is created from the very first pages. The story is about two friends that travel together looking for work on farms in California.    Lennie is a very large man with a feeble mind and George is Lennie's keeper who dreams with Lennie about eventually having a small piece of land where they can have animals and live from it.   The book is written using the slang of the 20's and Steinbeck uses incredible imagery throughout the book.  The quick story is bound to touch your heart and linger in your mind days after the last page has been read.  Enjoy!
B000UJCALI|1.0|Stanely Kubrick would roll over in his grave if he knew Warner cropped and shortened his movie. I'll wait for the Collector's Edition to be released (if there is one). This edition does not do homage to the directing master.
0061122416|5.0|I had never heard of this book until about a month ago when a friend I was visiting lent me his copy with no introduction to the story. I read it the next day and enjoyed it thoroughly.    Though I cannot offer you a deep literary critique of Coehlo's most popular work, I can say it is a fun and captivating read. It is absolutely worth the short time required to read it, and will satisfy the needs of the less jaded amongst us for adventure and a good yarn.    While reading The Alchemist, I was not looking for help or answers, and I did not find them. I was not deeply impacted by this book, but I will definitely recommend it to anyone who asks.     Don't go into this one believing you will get deep philosophical meaning from the tale, and you may just allow yourself to enjoy it.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|It's two years since Kanye dropped an album, and many people were left wondering whether Graduation could ever hope to live up to The College Dropout and Late Registration. Fortunately, it does. In Graduation, Kanye is experimental as ever (especially with the dreamlike \\"I Wonder\\"). No different from his previous albums, he has thrown in a few inspirational selections(The Glory, Champion), boastful(Barry Bonds ft. Lil Wayne), silly(\\"Drunk and Hot Girls\\"),and vulnerable (\\"Everything I Am\\"). Sampling is prominent throughout the album but it is utilized well. Some may question his ability to create songs without samples, but Kanye quickly dispels that claim with \\"Big Brother\\", a heartfelt tribute to his mentor Jay Z, and perhaps the best song on the album. If you're looking for hip-hop with substance, you would be hard-pressed to find a better mainstream alternative.
B000001GXI|3.0|This version (Böhm's second - the first was for Decca in 1955, without spoken dialogues: [[ASIN:B00004Z323 Mozart: Magic Flute]]) was recorded in 1964 and has enjoyed ever since the status of a classic. To a certain extent I can understand why it got the plaudits when it was first released - there wasn't much competition then, most of it was in mono (Böhm's lush and vivid stereo still holds up well today) and the rest (Klemperer came out the same year) didn't have spoken dialogue. But that it should still today be met with such reverence confounds me. Old habits rule, I guess.    One of the major problems is Böhm. He can conduct with dynamism and snap (in Papageno's and Monostatos' arias, for instance, or the Queen of the Night's second) but mostly his tempos are so slow you'd think he's trying to monkey Klemperer (but without the latter's unique granitic power). The arias are often plangent: Tamino wails in his first love aria (with a big romantic rallentendo at the end to make us clearly understand that it is the end of the aria), the Queen of the Night wails in hers (acceptable in the aria's first part, but meaningless when she forcefully orders Tamino to go and rescue Pamina: \\"Du! Du! Du!\\"). I can accept the solemn ponderousness of Sarastro's entry in Act I (though it sounds like George II, and the closing pages of Act I like Handel), but the beginning of the Act I finale, with the first entrance of the three kids, is not just impossibly solemn, it's under narcotics - it's like those dreams in which you are trying to move forward but are mired in invisible molasses. That must be Tamino's first patience trial (\\"sei standhaft, duldsam und verschwiegen!\\"): not falling asleep through that soporific tempo. On the other hand the ensuing recitative is finely paced, with muscle and a sense of drama. The second Ladies Quintet in Act II is so slow it made my jaws drop, and at that tempo no wonder the Ladies are so horrendously wobbly.    The cast of singers is anotherproblem. Wunderlich is wunderlich indeed, a glowing Tamino - he has both the silky sweetness and the affirmative heroism. On the other hand (oh the flak I'm gonna get for this!), I find Fischer-Dieskau insufferable. The voice is light-baritoned, becomes nasal at the top, and FD tries to compensate by affected over-acting. He doesn't sound like a warm-hearted, unsophisticated \\"Naturmensch\\", but like a campy hair stylist for a hip clientele in Berlin. But I'll grant that his \\"eins-zwei-drei\\" aria in the Act II finale is fine and his duet with Lisa Otto-Papagena perfect. Lear-Pamina has a rich, thick soprano voice that makes her sound matronly (she'd make a fine Cherubino), while Roberta Peters-Queen of the Night sounds juvenile: I guess in the realm of the night things are reversed, daughters are forty when mothers are twenty. But if you forget about the characters and fancy that it is Dorabella and Gugliemo (from Cosi) singing a love duet, her \\"Bei Männern\\" with Fischer-Dieskau is quite moving, and she is even more in Act II, despite some slight vocal imperfections in the upper reaches. I've read many negative comments on Roberta Peters, but I find her far from objectionable (despite an ugly edit after the high F in her first aria) and even quite valiant in her second aria, but poor thing, in her first aria she has to make do with Böhm's lugubrious tempos, and that's more efficient in annihilating her than any glaring floodlight cast by Sarastro.    Speaking of whom Crass is soft-grained and full of kindness. His characterization in the Act I finale is rather bland (Böhm's elephantine gait doesn't help), but his Act II arias are fine. The Three Ladies are slanted in the direction of mezzo-alto and consequently sound matronly, if not wobbly. In principle, I consider that having the Drei Knaben sung by women is a betrayal of Mozart's message (in no way can anyone other than kids be the messengers between the worlds of Women and Men)  - but I'll admit to finding it OK on record, as the voices are boyish enough.     Despite, or possibly because of the age that can be sensed in his somewhat wobbly voice, Hotter is a fine speaker, noble and poised. Friedrich Lenz as Monostatos is perfect, the voice is firm and suitably nasty. King and Talvela are Men in Golden Armors - they sing gloriously. Even I must give in to the Trials scene, everything comes together magnificently, with imposing grandeur and tear-wringing solemnity. Overall I can live with Böhm's Act II finale. Though it conveys little sense of urgency, at least the staid tempos remain within acceptable limits.    Though none is credited in the booklet, I strongly believe it is actors and not the singers who speak the text. The voices are timbrally well-chosen and blend well with their vocal counterparts - even the spoken Pamina sounds horribly matronly - but then no-one can quite imitate Fischer-Dieskau's unique vocal color and turns of phrase, and this is clearly not it. For Crass-Sarastro I am not so sure. The dialogue is cut, sometimes a little too drastically I find, and is often nicely delivered (the Three Ladies' polyphony is particularly well done, the dialogue between Monostatos and Pamina after the Act II Queen of the Night Aria is very effective, the Papagena is funny with her Viennese accent), but also constantly rushed through as if everybody was in a hurry to get on with the essentials - the music.    Ultimately, I don't find that this recording's assets are enough to warrant the high marks it has received. But if those who endorse it prefer it to, say, Solti ([[ASIN:B0000041ZF Die Zauberflote / The Magic Flute]]) or Christie on period instruments ([[ASIN:B000005E3W Mozart - Die Zauberflöte / Mannion, Dessay, Blochwitz, Scharinger, Hagen, Les Art Florissants, Christie]]), so be it. After all, there are some who still prefer their Handel's Julius Cesar by Wunderlich and Ferdinand Leitner conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in 1965.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Have this on order but already know it's going to be fantastic.  Love this series and getting the season's shows on DVD makes it even better ... no advertisements to interrupt.  These characters individually are fabulous by themselves but together, as someone said, 'They Rock!'.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|I was a bit hesitant to buy the Collector's Edition of Serenity as I'm getting a bit tired of the \\"rereleasing\\" trend that has come about. If you've got the extras put them on the first release. If you've got deleted scenes or extended scenes put two versions of the movie on the first release as well, the theatrical and the director's cut. Come on, people. Why do you think so many people are just downloading movies. Anyway, enough of my little rant.     I'm a huge Firefly/Serenity fan and a huge Joss Whedon fan in general so I got the collector's edition. It has all the extras from the first release (good job, guys!) and lots of new stuff. My only real issue is I would have liked to see a second version of the film included that had all the extended or deleted scenes put in. But I can't complain too bad. This is really worth the money. Also if you haven't seen  [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]] yet, I recommend checking it out first.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, a recently-rediscovered contemporary of Dickens. Tells the story of an English family's transition from life in the countryside to a gritty industrial town.  A love story as well as a historical look at how the industrial revolution transformed society.  Excellent!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is a beautifully made film. The acting is superb and the story inspiring. It reminds us that one person can make a difference and that there are things in this world worth fighting for, no matter how long it takes. I also recommend John Newton's autobiography, [[ASIN:0825433193 Out of the Depths]] for more inspiring insights into his experiences. William Wilberforce and John Newton were two true heros. It is refreshing to finally have a film being made about people whom we would do well to emulate rather than all the depressing biopics being made recently.

Upon reading this novel be prepared for this one person's controversial thoughts, (with holes in her philosophy), on politics, ideals and livelihood for the long 700 plus pages.    Taken as a novel, the book is far from being brilliant.  Lacking realistic characters, lacking character development and change, this novel simply lacks.  The two dimensional characters are set out to be a certain way and that is the way they remain.  This stagnation in my opinion makes poor novels.  Good novelists create real people experiencing a wide range of believable emotions and a deep penetration into their psychosis.  Great novelists can create these characters and document a change throughout the course of the novel keeping to the deep penetration into the psychological insights of the characters.      The weakest part of the novel was the melodramatic dialogue and unbelievable character interactions.  What were Roark and Dominique doing to each other?  Their relationship went beyond even the ideals of romanticism to the ideals of nonsensical.  It was not hot or passionate or seeking the highest concepts of love but rather was over the top, unrealistic and just plain weird.     The writing has no aesthetic value, no beautiful use of words or combination of word, no mood enhancing sentence rhythms, no flow from sentence to sentence or chapter to chapter.  The primary purpose of the writing was to get the point across, similar to an averagely written article.    Setting the book as a novel and the writing style aside, I think Rand's intention was to express her philosophy.  This can explain why she creates the characters as they are and as I described them, not as real people but rather as ideals, and notions.  This fact that the characters are unreal is not only the flaw in the novel but the flaw in the philosophy.    It fails because she creates a human being that is perfect.  No one can create a building as good as Roark.  He is never wrong and it is taken for granted anything he touches is perfection.  In real life no one is perfect.  People can be great at what they do but not perfect.  Therefore, it is possible that a real person who is a genius, (but not perfect) might miss something or make a mistake.  Therefore, it is necessary that other people are needed to create things as close to perfection as possible.  Getting many minds together working COOPERATIVELY is more powerful and greater than one.  Rand confuses creating works of art, where the one artist makes his/her personal expression versus a thing of practicality and necessity such as buildings.    Rand promotes the idea of working only for yourself and having selfish goals.  While working or caring for others is the most horrid, base premise only for the weak or the corrupt.  She contrives to make the one who helps other, (Toohey) the epitomy of corruption and I would even go as far as to say Diabolically evil (which is also stupid, characters like that should only be in stories like star wars or lord of the rings).    I would like to ask Rand, can you create and work for yourself and yet for others.  Can it be possible that a human being can have a heart, likes people and gets the greatest personal reward (or selfish goal) from seeing other peoples lives improved or alleviating suffering or hardship?  Can the only reward someone gets is producing/creating some inanimate object such as a building?  Maybe people make you happy.  An individual can have a selfish goal to make people happy, it is what makes this individual happy, and it has an affect of making people better off as well.    Her philosophy promotes the creator or the genius.  How many people in society does this encompass?  In other words, it is a philosophy for the elite.  It makes sense and sounds good on paper, similar to her antithesis (Marx and Lenin); however these are philosophies not for this world.  A combination of the philosophies or a meeting in the middle is the most realistic.  It seems at times like the purpose of this novel was to put down a theory of government she was against.      The books greatest achievement is the creation of a character we can all try to emulate.  Roark's intense individualistic spirit is something we can all strive for.  He knows what he wants and asserts himself one hundred percent never compromising who he is no matter what circumstances befall him or who attempts to manipulate him.      Her philosophy on livelihood is also displayed in the book.  All actions, words and movement have the most vital dramatic purposes creating a very heavy tone and being devoid of all humor.  I believe she promotes this intense profoundness in life.  I on the other hand believe living this way can lead to unhappiness.  I'd be curious to know if Rand was a happy person.  It is important to be able to laugh at life and even yourself and take things some what light heartedly since there are so many unforeseen circumstances completely out of ones control.    Despite all of this the philosophy was obviously thought provoking, has substance and really is saying something.  It is controversial material and I thought I saw a tremendous amount of holes in her reasoning which further reinforced my own beliefs.  However Howard Roark's individualism and integrity is something that all can look to strive towards and I thank the person for bringing this book to my attention for all the thought derived from it.
0765316978|4.0|\\"The Lasr Colony\\", alas, is also the last of a trilogy that began with the brilliant \\"Old Man's War\\" and was followed by the inventive \\"The<br />Ghost Brigades\\". The first two volumes literally crackled with excitement, very interesting future technology and reverberated with good old-fashioned space combat.<br /><br />  John Perry, hero of \\"Old Man's War\\" and Jane Sagan, formerly of the Colonial Special Forces, have taken up housekeeping on the colony planet Huckleberry. With their adopted teenage daughter Zoe, they live a reasonably content, if placid life. (Without ever saying so, Scalzi does lead you to think about why anyone would want to be a colonist anywhere, any time, regardless of the technology available. In a way, Scalzi describes a simple life that would drive most urbanites out of their minds in short order.)<br /><br />  One day General Rybicki appears on the planet to make Perry and Sagan an offer they can't refuse: take leadership of a new colony to be established by the Colonial Union. Reluctantly Perry and Sagan accept and become the leaders of Roanoke, a new colony of Earthlings.<br /><br />  A rather large problem looms since an (unbelievably) secret organization of more than 400 races from around the Universe have formed the Conclave which has ordered that no new single race colonies be created. (Scalzi's Universe, by the way, is not at all a peaceful place.)<br /><br />  Unlike the two earlier volumes, \\"The Last Colony\\" is largely a story about interstellar politics and old-fashioned diplomatic gameplaying. Sadly it is not nearly as exciting as its predecessors. There's not a whole lot of science in this fiction.<br /><br />  Scalzi, in earlier works, did a bang-up job of centering the story individually on Perry and then on Sagan. This time, he tries to spread the attention over Perry, Sagan, the young Zoe and her Obin bodyguards, hostile (but humane) generals, local political opponents . . . and, frankly, too many people. Scalzi doesn't fail, but he does dilute the power of his writing.<br /><br />  Overall, \\"The Last Colony\\" is a good read, but probably only if you've read \\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"The Ghost Brigades\\". Scalzi tries to fill in the backstory, but really can't. Standing alone, I don't think \\"The Last Colony\\" would have made a lot of sense.<br /><br />  Like many, I am sorry to see the end of the John Perry and Jane Sagan characters, at least in the roles we'vd become accustomed to. By the same token, Scalzi is a very strong writer and I will be interested in seeing what next springs from his imagination. (I also recommend Scalzi's [[ASIN:0765309416 The Android's Dream]]).<br /><br />Jerryting.

B000P2A24W|5.0|I have loved Bon Jovi since I was 12 years old, and they have have their great albums and their ok albums.  Lost Highway is \\"Great\\"  Not since \\"Slippery When Wet\\" have I been so in love with an album.   Some people don't like this CD however, they need to understand that Bon Jovi is all grown up now,  they have to change their style to what is fitting for them NOW as grown men. They are not babies anymore and I personally don't want to hear hard rock from anyone pushing 50. Not cool!     This album is beautiful and a new country style for Bon Jovi that shows they are REAL musicians, not a fly by night, third rate rock band that is here today, gone tomorrow (like all the other bands that came out when they did).  Bon Jovi is still here, still rocking, and can still sell out concerts. They are the best of their time, and need to be respected for their craft and their versitility. I LOVE this album, and would recommend it to anyone. Rock/Country on Bon Jovi, you guys are the best.

If you didn't know that that was the world's perfect litmus test before seeing the movie, you have the most amazing ah ha moment when you first here it explained in the movie. And when you start to think about it, that's when you remember, he's right. This is a great movie!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|He is the definate McClassy in my songbook!  The Canadian import is here to stay.  Michael's remake of Leonard Cohen's song, \\"I'm your Man,\\" will light a fire under anyone's feet. He is the new era crooner for the young, and young at heart. This is a CD worth a place in your music file collection.
B00026WUAU|3.0|Not necessarily a 5 star album--maybe almost a 4, but not one to pass over either.  I think I made a mistake giving it only 3 stars but they won't let me change it.  The sound has been remastered and the sound is GREAT--you would never think that this album HAD TO BE remastered.  I agree with one of the reviews from one of the books I have at home that Bob's voice is a bit nasal in this one.  HOWEVER, New Pony (a put down on one of his girlfriends?) is REALLY a VERY GOOD one and WORTH listening to.  It is not an enlightened piece of poetry, but it is good and when Bob sings, he hits all the difficult notes and passages with ease--that is amazing to me!!!  It has a good twang to it, a good beat to it and it is a great song.  In fact, it is one of my favorites.  Maybe this slight nasal sound to this song adds in a positive way to the back alley sound.  I have filed away a couple of his earlier albums, but not this one.  Just keep your expectations in check--that's all.<br /><br />I still think Bob Dylan is an amazing composer-song writer and equally a good singer since I never heard him off key at any time--truly amazing that he has it all.<br /><br />New Pony is not the ONLY good work in this album!  There are a few more that are GOOD that have been indicated on the other reviews.  I have no regret buying this album as ANY GOOD SONG DISCOVERED is a good deal.  You can never go wrong buying Bob's CDs at these prices.<br /><br />However, you may find this one CD super great as some of the others--you be the judge.
B00005JKCH|3.0|If you calculated how many other scenes each scene has relevence to you could show this movie to be statistically less cohesive than most. That's the problem with comic book movies, they try to be an origin story and an ultimate showdown between good and evil and cram it all into 90 minutes. There's no ongoing story throughout most of the movie, every marked out plot point is hit and then forgotten, none having an elaborate enough resolution to engage you before they're over.

0345404475|4.0|(This review is based on the novel as it is printed in the Library of America edition.)    Famed for being the basis of the cult movie \\"Blade Runner\\", this novel is, in my opinion, not as good a book as the movie is as a movie. There are big differences between the two, as far as the plot is concerned, and the mood, and quite frankly, I prefer that of the movie. But to the novel itself.    If you are familiar with Dick's style, you will not be in foreign territories here. All the features that define Dick's prose are there. Interestingly enough, and as for his other novels that I read, I never find myself bored, and it's always a pleasure to read Dick's work; and that, despite the shortcomings.    If you've never heard of \\"Blade Runner\\" or this novel, then here is a short sum up of the basics: it's set in the future, where humans colonise the universe, and have reached the level of technology enabling us to create androids, a sort of organic machines resembling humans. Those androids are illegal on earth and whenever some of them flee to this planet, bounty hunters are after them. The main Character of the book, Rick Deckard (named after René Descartes, the French thinker famous for his \\"cogito ergo sum\\", or \\"I think therefore I am\\") is one of those bounty hunters. As usual, Dick creates a very interesting dystopian world, the kind that you can't get enough information.    The story is a lot more complicated than that, and for those who know \\"Blade Runner\\", there are many things that you never heard of in the movie. Mercerism, to name but one. The fact that Deckard is a married man, and not much like the Deckard of the movie.    What I disliked about the novel was similar that what I dislike in every Dick novel I know of. For one, this novel has one of the worst titles in existence that I had the displeasure to lay eyes on. \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\", I cannot think this is anything close to a good title. Dick is quite bad when it comes to naming things. One reflex he has that I cannot stand is that he somehow feels obliged to give ridiculous names to either people or companies, and it just makes the whole thing sound grotesque. In \\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\\", one big company was called \\"Perky Pat Layouts\\"; in this novel, a TV host is named \\"Buster Friendly\\", and I won't list the others. Or just this one more: \\"andy\\". That is the word by which Dick has his novel call the androids. In plural form, this becomes \\"andys\\". Not very thrilling.    The movie changed those things. \\"Andys\\" become \\"replicants\\" and \\"bounty hunters\\" become \\"blade runners\\". All for the better, if you want my opinion. I believe the plotline of the movie to be far superior to that of the novel even though they share a lot, as would be expected. My feeling on Dick is that he crams so much material in his relatively short novels that he cannot get the best of it. Mercerism, mentioned above, is a quite obscure religion that never gets fully explained in the book, and is completely absent from the movie, and one understands why all too easily.     Another thing I think Dick is short on is descriptions. For all I remember, Dick rarely, if ever, describes much; and the result of this is that one doesn't really see the world in which the characters evolve. If you expect visions similar to those in the movie, you will be disappointed. In Dick's novel, Earth is being abandoned by everyone, and it's mostly desert and gets less and less populated. Quite unlike the Earth of the movie, quite unlike the megacities people live in. I think it's an impressive feat that the people who made \\"Blade Runner\\" based it on this book. The themes are excellent, and Dick, in my opinion, doesn't reach the full extent of what he could have done. To name one example, the relation between creator and creature, à la Frankenstein, is entirely nonexistent in the novel, whereas it's central in the movie.     If you love the movie, you will only get disappointed by thisbook if you expect it to do the movie justice; it won't. But it's nevertheless a good read and an interesting one with regards to the \\"Blade Runner\\" universe. It won't be as good as the movie - that's hard - but it is a good read, and that is why despite all my negative comments I still gave this novel 4 stars. I would recommend to people who enjoy the movie, but I'm not sure I would have enjoyed the book the same had I not known of the movie first. Yet, there definitely are good things in the book.
B000AWYOG4|3.0|Based upon a Japanese film of similar name, DARK WATER stars Jennifer Connelly as Dahlia Williams, a recently divorced woman who is trying to make a new life for her and her daughter, Ceci (Areil Grade).  An ongoing custody battle with her ex-husband, Kyle (Dougray Scott) hasn't left Dahlia with much money, but she is able to find an inexpensive apartment on an island across from Manhattan.  The apartment is small and somewhat dingy, but the landlord Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly) seems quite helpful, the building is close to the school, and it's in Dahlia's price range.  So she takes it.<br /><br />At first she doesn't pay attention to a small water stain on the ceiling of the bedroom. Then Dahlia notices that the stain grows larger and is dripping dark water.  Then Ceci finds a little girl's backpack on the roof of the building and later her schoolteacher informs Dahlia that Ceci has been speaking with an imaginary friend named Natasha.  The apartment makes strange noises and Dahlia thinks she sees strange kids running around on the abandoned floor above. Her migraines become more intense and she starts having more frequent nightmares about her own troubled childhood. Dahlia believes that it's all connected and investigates into the root cause of all the problems.<br /><br />DARK WATER was marketed in the U.S. as a horror movie. I'm not really sure why because the film isn't a horror movie.  It does have a gothic tone and is suspenseful, but that's about the only connections to the horror genre the film has.  The movie reminded me most of some of the suspense films of Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have about DARK WATER is that it moves at a very slow pace.  The slow pacing augments the gothic tone of the movie, but it also makes the movie very difficult to watch all the way through in one setting.  What I enjoyed most about the film was the actual story and the acting.  The lovely Jennifer Connelly is brilliant as ever and John C. Reilly does a great job as the landlord.<br /><br />If you can handle the slow pacing DARK WATER is an average suspense film that is particular fun to watch on a rainy day.rd.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|One of the main treats is the wonderful, rare archival footage of 50's-era Hibbing, early 60's Greenwich Village, and numerous original pathfinders of the genre that would become branded by the recording industry as folk music.  The first disk is the most interesting, and provides a background of how the artist was created.  From his beginnings as a youth in Hibbing, listening late into the night to performers on distant AM stations, he latches onto their sounds, and the musician-composer begins to develop.  We see a great artist growing not in a vacuum, but rather through a compulsion to consume and digest everything around him, and to experiment without boundaries.  His extrication from the drab canons of Hibbing becomes as inevitable as the sunrise.  The running narrative by the present-day Dylan lends an autobiographical sense to the documentary.  What is revealed is not just the events, but also how he felt about those tumultuous years, a viewpoint available only now that he feels comfortable openly reflecting on these experiences.  Viewers may find the scenes of Dylan in his later post-acoustic concerts a little drawn out, and some of these performances do seem dreadful.  The audiences clearly thought so, and perhaps that is the way the filmmaker thought you might react.  This is what Dylan eventually became, right before his motorcycle accident.  You are left to decide for yourself whether, at that point in time, he had descended from his best work.
1596680296|5.0|I have never knit socks before except for my Fuzzy Feet slippers that were intended to be felted (thus, no need to worry about little mistakes). I bought this book based on the previous recommendations on Amazon.com and after looking through it at a local store.    I was also curious about knitting socks with two circular needles and though this book does not explain in detail how to do so, the instructions on how to knit socks based on dpns is so well thought out, clearly described and illustrated, that I had no trouble attempting my first pair on two circulars.  Ann Budd does briefly describe and illustrate several methods for knitting in the round (dpns, two circulars, one circular).    She also explains several methods for flexible cast-ons, finishing the toe of the sock, avoiding or fixing the hole that tends to occur at the top of the gussets, making the heel and toe more durable, etc. There are several wonderful patterns that even an experienced sock knitter would enjoy AND Ann Budd explains several variations for any pattern that would get you on your way to a customized sock.    I really appreciate the fact that the sock patterns are not yarn-specific and, instead, are based on number of stitches per inch. I bought some yarn that I really liked and needles that fell in the middle of the range listed on the yarn. Then I did a gauge swatch, counted the number of stitches per inch and found a pattern in this book to match. So easy!    It is an excellent book and very colorful.

The Braid and Trim Selector has clear, crisp, colorful, actual size photos of the various braids and trims covered in the book. And they are really beautiful.  My only problem with the book is that it is in a rather small format (7.8X6.6x1 inches) and has correspondingly rather small print.  I might prefer to photocopy pages and enlarge the size if I'm trying to follow the instructions for a particular item.  I'm glad I bought this book and I look forward to trying many of these gorgeous trims.  This really is a magnificent book.

B00005JLCI|1.0|The juxtaposition of the late 19th century settings and Shakespearian English creates an air of a Broadway musical. For the first 15 minutes it seemed the actors would burst into some uncontrollable dancing and singing of silly verses. Hamlet's gesticulation, facial expression and manners (throwing his mother-queen in her bedroom like a ball) are more suitable for a hotdog vendor than a prince. Plenty of innovation such as a politically-correct multi-racial court and army. Aside from the aforementioned 19th century set, Ophelia's flashback of sex with Hamlet, nearly Siberian-deep snow (was it cheaper to rent the facilities in the winter?), pursuing the ghost across a battlefield, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern riding a locomotive - those are real gems. Lots of group fencing (some other Olympic sport or a football game would be very refreshing too). Ophelia in a straightjacket leaves no room for doubt - yes, she's insane. But the best one is the entire Norwegian army (dressed for the occasion in the Union Army uniforms, slightly faded) discretely approaching the palace and storming it while the unaware royals and unsuspecting courtiers enjoy a brawl complete with falls off a balcony and swinging chandeliers. And of course, Branagh lying in state is a great sight.     He must be given credit for his strict adherence to the original text though.
0440238609|5.0|I did find this book a little bit hard going to start off with. It was slow for about half of the first book but in hindsight, you need that time to establish the amazing concepts that will unfold through the rest of the trilogy.  Once things started moving it was very hard to put the book down, and I carried on with book two and then book three. Along the way we got to know and love so many likeable characters that it no longer seemed fiction, more like a story written about family.  I am glad I had the three books to read at once as I don't think I could have survived the suspense otherwise. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone over the age of 13, although to those people overly sensitive to implied criticism of the Catholic Church it may be a bit confrontational.

Score is so good that really involves you during each scene to feel the sadness, extreme fear or joy; the score is so good that the soundtrack is a most to buy for all collectors, as well as the Popol Vuh performances of the score available in other albums.  The movie won 2 awards and was nominated for Best Foreign Film by the USA Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films.

B00080Z53O|5.0|BEYOND 5 stars!    Every once in a while a film comes along that is so powerful in it's message,production,direction,cinematography,soundtrack and ensemble acting that it deserves multiple accolades;such is the 2004 Spanish Award winning THE SEA INSIDE (Mar Adentro)from writer/director/soundtrack composer Alejandro Amenabar whose earlier triumph THE OTHERS was a foreshadowing of great things to come.    THE SEA INSIDE is a tour-de-force in film making.The story of Ramon Sampedro, a man who was a quadriplegic for nearly thirty years and confined to a bed in a room,could have been extremely claustrophobic in the hands of less experienced directors and actors,but Amenabar and Javier Bardem as Ramon take this film,it's message and the lead character way beyond the confines of a bedroom and open it up into a glorious triumph and resiliency of the human will to persevere for freedom of conscience and dignity.Ramon wants to die;this is his fight for the right of choice that hit headlines the world over.Ramon has a most unusual quality to inspire greatness and vitality in others, but wants to end the hell that he experiences daily imprisoned in his lifeless body.This film is not preachy,nor does it become a soapbox for pro choice or pro life.All sides are presented fairly and with much thought and sensitivity.Ultimately, the story is one man's personal desire with the issue of euthanasia and Javier Bardem,who recently impressed in GOYA'S GHOSTS (an English speaking role) shows why he is among the top actors in the world today with his transcendent performance in THE SEA INSIDE.    The film is in Spanish.The English subtitles FLY so get ready to read quickly.There is a documentary on the dvd about the writing of the screenplay with Amenabar.It is informationally quite interesting, but it is filmed like reality T.V.     This is a film that will be viewed often for it's numerous aspects of greatness.Highly recommended purchase for the price.
B000FP2OPY|1.0|Probably, something is wrong with me. I was hooked by the reviews and, since I have the ability to suspend belief, was excited by the prospect of becoming engaged with this one. But I found nothing of value here. Poor writing. Cheesey acting. Complete formula stuff. No depth or complexity in the plotting or the characters. Completely idiotic moments.       Now, I could only watch 4 episodes, so maybe it improves.        Not one piece of corn in this dung heap. My wife thought it was worse than I did.       If I could have rated it lower than 1 I would have.
0449000729|5.0|I took my dear sweet time reading this novel, and cherished every second.  Historical fiction works, and works well, when it can be lingered over, savored; when it can be read, then re-read, as the author's glowing accounts of historical events come to life right off the page.<br /><br />James Michener was a master of this craft; Edward Rutherfurd aptly keeps him company, as evidenced by his sweeping novel, SARUM.  Set in the author's hometown of Salisbury, England, this is a novel that tells the rich history of the valley where five rivers meet.  As seen through the eyes of members of five prominent families over thousands of years, the reader witnesses an astounding array of historical abundance:  from the wondrous building of ancient stonehenge to the meticulous construction of the world-renowned Salisbury Cathedral; from the influence of the Romans to the bloody invasion of the Vikings; from feudal oppression to the horrific Black Death; from civil war to Renaissance; from industry to empire.  Over and over, Rutherfurd tells a rich, compelling, absorbing account of the history of the Avon Valley--the history of England.<br /><br />Unlike other readers, I was not particularly bothered by each family having its own inherent propensity for a certain skill, or behaviour.  (For example, the Porters had an eye for detail and numbers; the Masons were inherently skilled craftsmen.)  This device enables the author to maintain consistency.  My only caveat is that, after a virtually breathless examination of countless centuries of events, the titanic happenings of the 20th Century are glossed over in only a handful of pages.  But this, however, did not take away from my supreme enjoyment of this novel.<br /><br />SARUM:  THE NOVEL OF ENGLAND does what historical fiction is supposed to do:  entertain and enlighten.  I learned, and I learned a lot, having read this book.  Highly recommended.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]
B00007AJGH|4.0|Yep, I'm a cartoon fanatic. Especially of the era depicted here and of the Hanna-Barbera/Filmation/Rankin Bass of my own era and the Simpsons.    What that said, this film has a lot for the cartoon lover. Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse actually in the same scene? A comic duel between Donald and Daffy Duck? Looney Tunes meets the Disney crew? This is an animationphile's dream come true!    However, the character of Roger is WAY too silly, stupid, and lacking in appeal for me. Imagine Jerry Lewis as a cartoon rabbit and you get the idea. A bit overdone in that aspect. But the business with Jessica Rabbit is amusing as well as the Robert Hoskins character (who interacts quite well with the cartoons-no mean feat for an actor).    Overall, it has it's moments (cartoon freaks will LOVE the ending), but not the kind of thing I want to watch more than twice.
B00009ZYBY|1.0|In one scene early in the movie, General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a prisoner who is about to be executed. He is kneeling, with his hands securely bound. His executioner stands behind him with his sword-point on his neck, about to sever his spine. The next instant Crowe is on his feet, sword in-hand and with both hands free. What utter nonsense!!! The only reality in Hollywood today is that today's movies have none. This movie, like most today, is annoyingly unrealistic. How can one possibly be \\"entertained\\" by such mindless garbage?     In another scene, the Emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) tells Maximus that before his soldiers murdered his wife they raped her repeatedly, and she begged them for more. Today's Hollywood loves to wallow in such filth! I do not, and I sincerely hope you don't either.    In short, this movie insulted my intelligence and assaulted my conscience, which is why I am giving it one star. Frankly, much of it doesn't deserve that.         BTW, I fully expect the negative responses to this review to outnumber positive responses seven to one, which is yet another indication of the serious trouble our culture, and our country, are in today.

B000O1799U|2.0|Repetitious. I lasted one hour watching this before I left the room. My spouse was able to watch it to the end and enjoy the story underneath.    I gave Moulin Rouge one star, partly because of the shrill grating voices. At least Dream Girls has more natural voices. And it was fun to see how different performers of the era were represented by these fictional characters. And there was at least one educational piece of historical information: Elvis was not the original singer for Hound Dog. It was Big Mama Thornton, but her version was suppressed by mainstream white radio.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I caught this one late ( 3 Years Ago ). As many have said, this   recording is one of the best rock ventures that has ever been done.  At first listen, alot of the songs on this album annoyed me. Loud, Jagged.  I was just a Bends nut and wondered what the hell the band was doing.  It took me several...well more than several listens to grasp the entire album. But when it hits you.....the lights go on and the front door starts swinging back and forth. I am moving towards 60...this record is  to be put on the shelf with Sgt Pepper, Dark Side. Who's Next. If you die in bed, this is what they should find in your cd player. Nuff said.
B000002KHH|5.0|My only exposure to Black Sabbath before purchasing this album, was hearing \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"Paranoid\\" on the various classic rock radio stations in my area. In fact, those two songs were the real reason that I purchased this album. After playing the album all the way through for the first time, I was literally blown away. There's not a weak track on this album (though some may dislike the experimental sound of \\"Planet Caravan\\"). I can't pick out a favorite track on this album, because they are all so good! One minor disappointment with this album is that the audio levels are much lower than I would have liked. Why didn't the producers crank it up to 11?

0596527055|3.0|This book is a quick read, and while I found it a little disorganized, I did not feel that I had wasted by time/money.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I recall feeling so strongly positive towards only two other films in my life, after seeing them initially, and those moments were after seeing \\"Apocalypse Now\\" back in 1980 and \\"Close Encounters\\" back in 1977. \\"Titanic\\" became the third and like the previous two, it has remained a definite top ten for me at the very least.  While I did not care for the \\"Redux\\" version of Apocalypse Now, or the various versions of CE3K, DVD's for purchase which contain all the good parts of both, are available and this particular Titanic DVD adds TONS of extra goodies, making it a must buy for any fan or even semi-fan of the film.  And at a great Amazon price.  In fact, I did buy this DVD and sent it off as a gift to my sister, who loves the movie as much as me.<br /><br />For all of its hype, awards, and budget (over $200 million), in many ways, this is a very \\"personal\\" film from director James Cameron (Terminator 2, The Abyss, Aliens, etc.), and never do the eye-popping special effects (of which there are plenty) get in the way of the very special adventure and exquisite and deep \\"love story\\" being told. That utterly and unashamedly romantic aspect, despite what some may think of such a blockbuster \\"disaster\\" movie, is at the heart of \\"Titanic,\\" and it is as powerful, convincing, and passionate, as the actual FX representation of the sinking of the ship, which only begins halfway through the movie itself.  Both halves however, stand on their own, and neither is less compelling and involving for the viewer. Add the two together, and what you've basically got is over three hours of absolutely spellbinding entertainment. To see \\"Titanic\\" in a way, is not so much like watching a movie, as it is to \\"experience\\" the best that cinema can possibly offer.<br /><br />I will not attempt to summarize the plot here (ship sails, ship sinks, okay?), to list various technical aspects of the production, nor even dwell on the historical event this fictional film uses as a backdrop for the story it tells. Such information can be found elsewhere.  And what has been said since its release by fans, has not already been said?  My only purpose is to present my astonishment in this work, how like the original Apocalypse Now and Close Encounters (and a few other top ten films on my list including 2001, The Apartment, The Music Man, etc.), this is basically just a perfect Hollywood film, frame to frame, and scene to scene.  And to encourage anyone who loves this movie to buy this extra-packed DVD goodie.<br /><br />Throughout, director Cameron's techniques seem flawless. It really does seem as if every piece of film, every scene, was carefully shot and edited in as exacting, interesting, accurate, involving, and exhilarating manner as possible. In addition, James Horner's brilliant music (in many different styles to boot) gives virtually every scene, regardless of the content, extra depth, feeling, and romance.  Not to mention the great title tune hit,  \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" by Celine Dion.  The theme of the song reverberates throughout the film and I'd strongly suggest buying the film's soundtrack as well.<br /><br />The movie is fascinating and completely involving from start to finish and even its three hour plus length is something almost unnoticed.  The characters, the suspense, the beauty of the cinematography and sets, the great acting by the leads, and the lavish and achingly romantic triumphs and tragic story themes explored throughout are all first rate.  And they only bring to mind just a few adjectives I can only think of when recommending with five stars (though it deserves ten) this masterpiece, \\"extraordinary,\\" \\"spectacular,\\" \\"breathtaking,\\" and simply unforgettable.  Despite it all, this movie does one other thing which makes it deserve my highest praise.  It brings back memories of my aging, sick mom (RIP), this being the last movie I saw with her in a theater.  And my main memory of that is that at the end, both of us clapped out loud, and cried.<br/><br />Finally, perhaps the most astonishing thing about the film however, is the power and almost cosmic taste Cameron gives to what amounts to a simple, old-fashioned (and done before), \\"love story.\\" Imparting a positive, life-affirming, almost logical/rational attitude on the whole concept of romantic love itself, which is something sorely lacking in so many \\"modern\\" movies, the film often takes on an almost surreal tone on passion and desire many times throughout. None of it however, comes off in any way as \\"preachy\\" or sugary-sweet and phony. True love and its mysterious veneration for the mundane and ordinary, is treated with reverence, understanding, and subtlety by Cameron in virtually every moment.<br /><br />I have a feeling it will be many more years before we see such cinematic gold like this again from the studio system. And this took the combined power and money of two studios to even produce.  However, I do hope that if and when Hollywood (as it inevitably must) tries something like this again, it will remember that the real power behind this particular film, has less to do with the fantastic effects or the obvious money spent to pull this off on screen, and more to do with the story and explicit/hidden, almost philosophical meanings and implications.<br /><br />\\"Titanic\\" is, in the highest sense of the word, not merely great entertainment throughout, but great ART.  This is a treasured gem, more valuable in spirit than the heart-shaped, priceless blue diamond \\"Rose\\" leaves with \\"Jack\\" in the end, somewhere at the bottom of the ocean.  For its main message is clear.  True love is invaluable and \\"goes on.\\"  Perhaps even (wishing my mom luck in reconnecting with her own Jack, and my father in any afterlife), truly forever.

B000KRNG5E|5.0|Classic Argento.  In my personal opinion its not as good of a film as Susperia but is definitely a worthy sequal to such a classic piece of horror cinema.  As in Susperia the cinematography is amazing and the kill scenes are always (in true Argento fashion) not only gory, but gory in a clever and orignal way with kills that at least i've never seen before.  The finale of the film is fantastic.  Overall this film was everything i'd expect from Argento.  I'd recomend it to any fan of horror.

Play it again, and again and again.
0618680004|2.0|I'm a bit late to The God Delusion party.  I casually thumbed through it a few times at the peak of its prominence, but it was not until a couple of months ago that I read it.  I was pretty unimpressed, and wrote a two-star review on this site for the book, and stored it away.  Just days ago, however, I have come across a video of Dawkins reading the new preface for the forthcoming paperback version of The God Delusion, and after watching it I can safely say that I very nearly hate this man and the brand of atheism he stands for.  It is based on the same irrationality and/or intellectual dishonesty that is the foundation of the religions he so hates.  Richard Dawkins has transformed atheism into a worldview which veers dangerously close to dogma.<br /><br />*********************************************************************<br />To begin with the actual book, then.  The God Delusion was one of the biggest sellers of 2006 and certainly the most controversial. It was largely controversial for comically, and regrettably, predictable reasons.  Namely, that much of the religious populace was outraged that someone would even consider the possibility that God  might not exist. I suspect much of the people outraged by The God Delusion never even read it.  However, if anyone reads The God Delusion with an open-mind, they will find it is indeed worthy of much criticism, particularly by those valuing objective reasoning.<br /><br />As any 400+ page volume is bound to, The God Delusion has its moments.  The section devoted to the widely held misconception that the United States was founded as a Christian nation should be required reading in all high school American history classes, so that we might nip in the bud any chance that these young minds are plagued by this flat-out falsehood to prevent the possibility that they, too, might one day trot out the pathetic reasoning often used to try and tear down the wall of separation between church and state.  Dawkins' heartfelt sympathy for \\"closet atheists\\" and efforts to reach out to them via a list of atheist organizations at the end of the book is much appreciated by this closet atheist.<br /><br />These, however, are the few bright spots on an otherwise bleak picture.  The vast majority of The God Delusion is plagued by lazy anecdotal reasoning and elementary exercises in argumentative fallacies.  The fourth chapter is presented as the intellectual heart of the book, in which Dawkins presents his own philosophical argument affirming the non-existence of God, an argument which he unashamedly claims that he suspects is unanswerable.<br /><br />Even before the actual argument is presented, this should raise a bit of a red flag. Richard Dawkins would surely only style himself as an amateur philosopher, at best.  Thousands of years of truly academic philosophy has not yet yielded a truly unanswerable argument for the non-existence of God, but an evolutionary biologist making his first real foray into philosophy has?  We would be remiss to pigeonhole Dawkins' argument based on this alone, but at the very least, it raises concerns.<br /><br />Concerns which, as it turns out, are warranted.  The Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit iatrocious.  Numerous problems beset it, all of which have been raised by professional reviews of the book.  The most substantial, extensively detailed in Alvin Plantinga's review is that the gambit is built entirely on the fallacy of question-begging.  Truthfully, the academic heavyweight of a Plantinga is hardly necessary for pointing this out.  The 747 Gambit is so transparent that anyone who's knowledge of question-begging extends only about as far the Wikipedia entry for it, such as myself, can see right through it.<br /><br />In a nutshell, here's the argument: Throughout history, the chief argument for the existence of God is that the Earth and the life inhabiting it show evidence of design. A designer is the intuitive explanation for this. But the designer hypothesis raises the immediate question of who designed the designer.  Thus, postulating a designer to account for apparent design has only proven to be a self-defeating argument, a \\"skyhook\\".  Instead, a gradual landscape of increasing complexity, a \\"crane\\", that has its origin in an infinitely more probable simple organism is a far more plausible argument.  Natural selection has proven to be this crane, rendering the appearance of design, and presumably, a designer, completely illusory.<br /><br />One could be forgiven for harboring a feeling of disappointment.  I myself remember my first reading of the Boeing 747 Gambit a full year before I read the entire book, then a restless fence-sitting agnostic, eager to come across a convincing argument for either side.  My initial reaction was one of disappointed puzzlement.  It seems Dawkins unanswerable argument is merely that elementary intuition of \\"Who made God?\\" dressed up in the lexicon of \\"cranes\\" and \\"skyhooks\\".<br />A more careful consideration, however, reveals that Dawkins' argument is decidedly more nuanced. An impressive, nuanced argument that sits upon a foundation of fallacies.<br /><br />The 747 argument is indeed unanswerable, if naturalism is presupposed.  But naturalism, by definition, opposes theism.  The 747 Gambit carries with it an implicit assertion of naturalism, and then argues that naturalism is true.  Thus, the essence of the 747 Gambit is that naturalism is true because naturalism is true.  Well, at least one question has been answered; We now know why bona fide philosophers have failed to stumble across this particular argument for the non-existence of God.<br /><br />Other concerns have been raised about the 747 Gambit, H. Allen Orr has noted that the 747 gambit confirms a scientific hypothesis without benefit of the scientific method, and Dawkins makes the mistaken assumption that a hypothesis is a self-defeating \\"skyhook\\" settles its truth value.<br /><br />If such a swiss-cheese argument is the \\"intellectual heart\\" of The God Delusion, surely the rest is similar trash, right?  Well, not in theory, no. In fact, it is worth mentioning that the Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit chapter is preceded by a chapter in which Dawkins tackles the classical proofs of God, and dismantles all of them with considerable skill and wit.  And what immediately follows it, the question of how religion fits into the landscape of evolution,  is a question well-suited to Dawkins' home fields of science and is addressed with obvious expertise.  And a brief chapter on the roots of morality is composed largely of intriguing hypothetical moral dilemna scenarios that are a good bit of fun to consider.<br /><br />From there, its almost uniformly downhill. Dawkins sets out to respond to the question of why he is so hostile to religion, and his reasoning is less than satisfactory.  Dawkins is hardly an impartial bystander here, but he would never even attempt to make the disingenuous claim that he is, and as a scientist, understands more than anybody the importance of setting aside personal biases in reason. But Dawkins reasoning does not turn out to conform to any measurable standard of objectivity.<br /><br />I imagine it would be possible to compose an entire book length critique on these chapters alone.  Dawkins reasoning is so lazy and obviously biased that virtually every conclusion he reaches is invalidated.  Dawkins harbors a considerable amount of contempt, and justifiably so, for \\"hell houses\\", actual faux-hell dioramas that young children are subject to in an effort to get them to fall into step with the establishment's religious crusade.  The horrific nature of these hell-houses(my blood curdles even writing about the practice), complete with sound clips of human beings screaming in agonizing pain and suffering, clearly represents the absolute bottom of the barrel of religious practice.  The \\"hell\\" of religion, if you will.  Hey, wait a minute, isn't Dawkins' himself subjecting his readers to the hell-houses of religion in an effort to get them to fall into step with his anti-religious cruade? Fancy that. Dawkins' would be worthy of being commended for such beautiful symmetry if it were any way intentional.<br /><br />The practice of raising substantiated concerns about the dangers of religion and then making broad, sweeping generalizations without considering the other side of the argument is exemplary of the entire section.  As an ex born-again Christian, I am familiar with a fairly large constituent of admirable young adults who bound together only by their youth group.  And I emphasize only.  Many of these kids, to be frank, would be without friends and mired in the despair of being a young adult with seemingly nothing in the world to hold on to.  A dangerous condition. Would Dawkins' so readily take the guiding force of friendship from the undoubted millions of very kids?  I suspect that he wouldn't, and would be rather unsettled by having to consider a prospect of religion that isn't the argumentative version of an Eephus pitch.<br /><br />The ultimate exposition of Dawkins near-vacuous reasoning when it comes to matters of religion can be seen in the emotionally resonant advertisement of the book inviting readers to \\"Imagine No Religion\\".  A beautiful picture of the twin towers of the World Trade set against a spotless sky and blazing sun tugs at the heartstrings.  The implication is clear, if religion didn't exist, this stunning sight would no longer be relegated to the confinement of photographs and memories.  If religion didn't exist, then irrational Muslim fanatics would have flown two airliners into the towers, culminating in the eventual deaths of more than 3000 human beings.  On the latter point, I suspect that Dawkins is entirely correct, and on the former, I suspect that he is entirely incorrect. If religion never existed, the World Trade Center would almost surely have never have been built.  Religion has so thorougly shaped the world we live in that to remove it from human history would have changed the course of it as completely as the prospect of the British Colonists deciding that King George wasn't really that bad and that they didn't really mind living under British rule after all. The second option, that Dawkins is merely asking us what might be if religion were completely removed as of now is as worthless as invoking us to imagine what a wonderful world we would live in if all guns and nuclear weapons were to suddenly disappear into thin air. A pathetic exercise in sunshine hippie idealism.<br /><br />Ultimately, The God Delusion is a book that is an overwhelming(but not total) display of selective reasoning, intellectual dishonesty, and swiss-cheese logic.  Its considerable success is an encouraging testament to receding negative attitudes towards atheism, and I stand by Dawkins in looking forward to the day when atheism is considered as innocuous a trait as the color of somebody's hair.  I cannot in good conscience stand behind him, however, on virtually any conclusion made in The God Delusion.<br />***********************************************************************<br /><br />Much of these criticisms were present in professional reviews of the book, which were decidedly less than consensual regarding the book's quality. Dawkins is, of course, afforded the right to respond to criticisms of his book, and he has in a new preface to the paperback edition of The God Delusion. He says that almost all serious criticisms of the book fall under the frame of beginning with, \\"I'm an atheist, but...\\" which is almost invariably followed with a few specific allegations. The first of the criticisms that Dawkins deals with is the one that he lacks sufficient scholarship of theology to rigorously examine it.  He appeals to an analogy offered by P.Z Myers regarding spirited debate over the many magnificent fabrics the Emperor is wearing, when it actuality the Emperor is nude.  He calls this theCourtier's Reply.  And it is certainly a valid reply to criticisms like Terry Eagleton's that contend that Dawkins is unfamiliar with the finer nuances that spring from a presupposition of God's existence.  But what of those reviews, specifically Plantinga's trashing review, that only examine Dawkins theology in the context of whether or not God exists?  Dawkins is surely familiar with them, but chooses to sidestep them entirely.  Not a mention is made to criticisms of the 747 Gambit.  Textbook intellectual dishonesty, an enduring trait of all religious dogmas.<br /><br />Dawkins sidesteps the accusations of his attacks being focused only on strawmen with a strawman false dichotomy: That he only attacks the religion practiced by people such as Ted Haggard, Osama Bin Laden,and Jerry Falwell instead of the more subtle, nuanced religion preached by recondite theologians because followers of that type of religion are numerically negligible, and concedes that if that type of religion were the prominent form of it, it wouldn't be so bad after all.  Does Dawkins really actually believe that any Christian who has disowned the blatant bigotry of Falwell types is part of a numerically negligible constituency poring over and pondering dense works of heavy theology night and day? It is here where we must make two important distinctions.  The first is that we need to specify what religion we are talking about. Addressing \\"religion\\" is inadequate for examining the mutually exclusive religions, namely, we need to make the distinction between Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. But Dawkins makes no such distinction and lumps Osama Bin Laden in with Jarry Falwell and Ted Haggard. Secondly, it is important that we distinguish religious dogma and religious people.  While the dogma practiced by moderate Christians is as intellectually vacuous and irrelevant as the fundamentalists, moderate believers are not to be equally judged with fundamentalists as to their value as human beings.  There certainly exists a vast number of fundamentalist bigots and a tiny number of \\"nuanced theologians\\".  There also exists a large, perhaps larger number of moderate Christians who, aside from some misguided views regarding stem cell research and abortion, are largely benign and peaceful people who shouldn't be generalized with outright bigots, hypocrites, and even murderers. If Dawkins is knowingly making this generalization it can only be described as an irrational opinion blinded by a general worldview, a hallmark of fundamentalist religion. Or perhaps he is truly aware that his position is irrational, but chooses not to concede the point because it doesn't fit his anti-religious agenda.  Textbook intellectual dishonesty, another pillar of fundamentalist religion.<br /><br />Dawkins moves on to the contention that his language is shrill and unkind.  He correctly points out that shrill and unkind remarks are found everywhere in the media, and quotes some particular scathing restaurant critiques as examples.  He says the language in his book is tame in comparison, and only seems shrill because of the conception that religion should be shielded from all criticism.  And again, Dawkins has conjured up a strawman.  It would serve him well for someone to point out that the restaurant critiques he quotes insult the food being served by the restaurant, and do not draw any conclusions on the Chef's value as a human being.  Dawkins has again blurred the line between religious dogma and religious people.  Criticism of religious dogma should certainly be encouraged in the 21st century,  subsequent belittling declarations certainly shouldn't.  It is interesting that Dawkins characterizes religion as a \\"delusion\\" and attacks those blinded by the delusion.  I know of a guy in town who carries a stuffed dalmation everywhere he goes, seats it across from him at restaurants, and talks to it.  Reportedly his actual dog died at some point in the past and he is now under the delusion that this stuffed dog is his real dog and is capable of hearing the things he says to it.  Reportedly, this man is also a genuinely kind and gracious human being.  Is he a total fool, an ignoramus of the highest order, that should be ruthlessly dealt with?<br /><br />Richard Dawkins fails to examine religion and its followers in any meaningful way.  He fails to carefully consider all of its pros and cons.  One reason for this is clear.  Any good consequence that comes of religion is not much of an interesting story.  Nobody is going to sit glued to their television segments or magazine articles devoted to a teenage youth groups efforts to feed the homeless.  Even a seven-figure donation to an admirable charity from some religious multi-millionaire is not going to draw much of the public's attention. Imagine that that money is used for research that eventually saves a number of lives. Religion has then done a great deal of good, but in an indirect and not readily apparent way. It is often pointed out that such things aren't a testament to the value of religion, because donations to charities and efforts to feed the homeless are certainly not exclusive to religious people, but yet, when religion compels someone to do something horrible like murder somebody, the fact that non-religious people commit murder too is unaddressed, and instead the crime is taken to be damning of religion. A double standard of evidence plaguing, yep, religious dogma.<br /><br />If Richard Dawkins and his sheeple of followers would like to see a classic example of the worst kind of religious dogmatic: that has a pre-ordained conclusion, and exercises double standards of proof, irrationality and intellectual dishonesty to form the evidential basis of his opinion, I would suggest that they look in the mirror.  Richard Dawkins is the figurehead of a type of atheism that veers dangerously close to religion, a type that any true rationalist should want no part of.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|I first heard Radio Nowhere about three weeks ago, and since then according to my iPod have listened to it close to 200 times. As of Friday I have heard the full album and must say - I really love it. High energy with a lot of soul - pretty much the reason why I love Bruce's music so much. Being back with the E Street Band seems to have given him a lot of inspiration, and overall the album is catchy. Why not GREAT? It seems to loose steam after RN, and although the songs are great, there is something missing. Its a crossbreed of The Rising / Tunnel of Love with The River drive to it... but I haven't been able to get THE thing that makes this album stand on its own feet and make it truly magical...well except for ---- IS THERE ANYBODY ALIVE OUT THERE?
B000K7VHPU|5.0|Sheer pleasure! The acting, the plot and the photography are among the best ever! It has so many facets that it warrants seeing more than one.<br />Edward Norton's finest performance.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I've been a fan and follower since I was eight years old (and that was a LONG time ago)!  I've read and watched several books and videos on the band over the years but I heard and saw things in the Anthology that I've never read, heard, or saw before.    Whether you're a young fan who has discovered their music through your parents...or grandparents; or you've been a long, long time fan of the greatest rock & roll band, you'll find this series very entertaining and interesting.
B00023B1LC|4.0|He comes to on a fishing boat with bullets in his back and no idea how he got there, who shot him, or why. Oh, and he's got a bank account number on his body.      When he goes to the bank, the safe deposit box is full of money and at least half a dozen passports with different identities.  So, which one is his?  In some ways, he has a chance to start a new life--but the old one really isn't leaving him behind.    People are chasing him--with guns.  More important than that, how does he know just how to evade them?      \\"Bourne\\" is a riveting story about a man who's in a terrible position and unable to really know who is friend or foe.  This film has one of the best car chase scenes I have ever encountered--with a Mini Cooper, no less!  The book was good, the film almost better.
1591396190|5.0|I like the non text book clear presentation. You do not have to have an MBA to enjoy and learn from this book.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Yes, Paul Verhoeven should have directed Troy. He could have filmed the graphic violence depicted in The Iliad to greater effect. But I'm sick and tired of all these damn purists hollering \\"historical\\" epic. The Iliad was a greek myth, not an actual historical event, but a long poem composed by a writer named Homer. However, I do maintain that if you are going to base the movie on the book, the writer, producer, and director of the film should have kept to the original story. Why call it \\"Troy\\" and then fabricate something else if just to sucker in those who've read the Iliad. It's the same thing with comic book adaptations like the X Men. Why adapt material of such a large devoted following and change the character histories, costumes, etc., and call it the X Men?<br /><br />Troy, of itself, is a good Hollywood film. Pawned as Homer's Iliad, the movie's not just a fraud, it's a disgrace and an insult. As if the producers of the film felt that they could improve on a story that's been around, studied, and loved for over 2,500 years. I think Verhoeven, Peter Jackson, or Spielberg--especially with the brutality of Saving Private Ryan (wow)--could have done not only a better job, but they--I believe--would have stayed truer to Homer's original story. As far as violence goes, no novel revels in it like the Iliad. A film version of the book, if depicted as Homer depicted in the Iliad, would be a strong NC-17 or a weak X rating. If you want to see--or visualize--action and violence on a whole other level, read the Iliad and skip Troy. But if you're just looking for a good popcorn, beer, smoke, movie then Troy is as advertised.

B00005JLCI|5.0|I have seen Olivier's and Gibson's renditions of Hamlet and each has much to recommend it, but this is my absolute favorite. I purchased the VHS as a used copy from the video store and carefully preserved it as I anxiously awaited the DVD release. The dvd tranfer looks great. I have a 36\\" Sony TV, but no high definition. The music is beautiful and suited to each act, the sets spectacular, and the main characters are excellent in their portrayals. I love the intense passion Branagh gives to his Hamlet, the period setting he uses, the fact that the entire play is included and his attention to detail. The only weakness for me is in the performance of a couple of the secondary characters.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|i l love the original version of this concert. it has an awesome feel to it. what a super cool setting. the director's cut is ok but watch the original first.    thanx to the floyd.      bush hog
0312360266|4.0|If you think you know what to expect from a PC Cast, then think again, this fantastic new series is unlike anything she's done before, so it looks like the addition of her daughter Kristin as a writing partner had a major impact.  Remember the hellish days of the school cliques and being targeted by the most powerful girl in the school and lusting over the hottest boy?  Well add to that you've just discovered you're a potential vampyre and you might have a tiny idea of the nightmare that is currently Zoey Redbird's existence.<br />In Zoey's world vampyres have always existed, they're just kind of weird and nobody wants to admit they know any.  So when Zoey starts developing symptoms, she's packed off to the House of Night, a school where she'll spend the next four years of her life training to see if she'll survive the change from Human to Vampyre.  It's never easy being the new kid, and when you've just been \\"Marked\\" as one of the most powerful fledglings in history you'd better make sure you keep your friends close but your enemies closer.  Now if Zoey can just figure out who she's supposed to trust, then things would be a lot easier.<br />If like us you've been wowed by Stephanie Meyer's Twilight and Rachel Caine's Morganville Vampires then here's another intense, addictive young adult series that will keep you reading well past your bedtime.
B00005JLWN|5.0|if you liked the matrix than this movie is right up your alley. christian bale is the lead actor and does a great job as a sense offense officer and then actually an offender. this movie makes you think of big brother or 1984 great movie. it is easy to picture yourself in this story line and his reactions are very real.
0316067598|5.0|This is a very patriotic book. Marcus Luttrell does people a favor for telling his story and also helps the families of his friends heal. I would like to recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about war      from a soldier's perspective.
B00012FXAE|5.0|\\"Aliens\\" is in my 10 Top all time favorite Science Fiction movies. So I wanted to get it on DVD. Glad I did! This set is Magnificent. Not only do you get  Lots of extra deleted scenes from original movie showing, but you get an extra disc with Super Great interviews with actors such a Sigourney Weaver and Michael Biehn not only while working on the original movie but from recently looking back. I recommend this dvd set highly to anyone who likes James Cameron movies too. As he is the consumate Producer/Director as you can see from his other fine movies, Titanic and other sci fi movies.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I bought this dvd and I do not repent myself, a product of excellent quality. Congratulations Amazon.com because she was perfect in the delivery of the product.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|It really does deserve all the five star reviews! I started watching halfway into the season and I got into the show pretty quick. Dexter's sister & girlfriend are awesome! I love how every episode turns a dark reality into something good. The show questions what makes identity and what you really know about yourself. Alot of the camera work reminds me of x-files for some reason, probably because the show is also a mystery/suspense. Dexter has a lot more swearing, blood, and a good amount of dramatic suspense than any other show out there, and for some reason it makes you feel good after watching it. I love Dexter.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|I knew nothing of this film before watching it except that Ryan Gosling was in it. He's a very good actor and I like his film choices, but I must give credit to Shareeka Epps who's acting chops amazed me. I was mesmerized by her character and her subtle expression which made her seem very old and wise beyond her years. I was completely engrossed in this film and it's characters. An interesting little film. Surprise surprise!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I've been a fan of Enya's music since an Irish friend, who raved about her over and over, introduced me to her music back in 1989. I fell in love with her music immediately. I was living a very stressful life in Tokyo at the time and listened to her all... the... time to relax and be transported to a quieter place while traveling on the crowded subways and streets. Her crystal clear melodious voice takes me to some really nice spaces and I love the soft and atmospheric synthesizer created music accompanying her. I own all of her CD's and usually buy them as soon as they come out. This time I downloaded Amarantine straight from iTunes like the day it was available and I wasn't disappointed. It's right on par with all of her other CD's and doesn't really deviate from her usual fair. I've never been disappointed in any of her music.I even love the dance remixes with her music or the rap blends.<br /><br />Some songs like \\"Amarantine,\\" \\"Amid the Falling Snow,\\" \\"A Moment Lost,\\" and \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" are kind of popish and not so much my favorites. But there are other songs like \\"Sumiragusa,\\" \\"Drifting,\\" \\"The River Sings,\\" and \\"Less Than a Pearl,\\" which are more reminiscent of her more darker and dreamier spatial songs, which I do like. I also prefer her non-English songs and there is at nice ratio in this CD.
0743486285|5.0|I have been a Crue fan since I was a kid. I always thought Nikki was just about the cat's meow in all ways. This book was a really great read into his life in a HORRIBLE time that should have been great. His addiction really speaks out in this book, and it really pained me to read about someone so totally hooked on drugs.<br />The only problem I had ( other than THANK GOD he came to grips over it) was his fixation on his childhood. It WAS a sad story, about his father abandoning him, and a mother so immature and selfish at times, that she let other people raise him, but what bugged me so bad was that it bugged HIM so bad. He really, basically, blamed his addiction on his childhood, and I think that was pretty sad. I had a Johnny Cash song childhood, and YES I made a few bonehead decisions when I was younger and blamed them on my Dad dying, his alcoholism, etc, but I just honestly NEVER let it push me into doing SMACK!I guess some people just deal with things differently than others.<br /> I really did like the story, I think he did himself a justice writing it, and I was really pleased with the ending, a SOMEWHAT happy one, but one that held a lot of hope, and hope is what keeps a person going.<br />There was absolutley NOTHING glamorous in this book, and that is a GOOD THING, makes you really THINK about what hell an addiction can be.<br />OH...and I STILL think Nikki is the cat's meow!!!!
B000001E21|5.0|This CD is packed with fast pace music gems (cept for two acoustic spots) that come from the earlier Hysteria sessions.  So there are some Clarke goodies here too.  You can hear the distinctive Pyromania-Hysteria style here that was their bread and butter for the 80s.  Miss You in a Heartbeat and Two Steps Behind have acoustic and electric versions (of which I think the electric is better).  Desert Song, Fractured Love, Ride Into the Sun and Ring of Fire (compares a bit to Run Riot) are just awesome pieces.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Have been a Crue fan for years. Heard from a friend about his book and CD. The CD has some really POWERFUL songs on it, and the whole band is very talented. At times the disk was disturbing to me, but I think that was what they were going for. Make sure you read the book, as well.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|If Megadeth was thrown into a cauldron with vintage 80's Iron Maiden and King Diamond (particularly \\"Abigail\\"), it would sound like \\"United Abominations.\\" There is a huge European metal sound on this record (loads of twin lead guitars, a zillion musical time changes) that can be partially attributed to Glen Drover joining the band (he's a former King Diamond guitarist.) Megadeth has always had elements of that in their music, but rarely this dedicated over an entire album.     Adding to this sound is Drover's brother Shawn on drums. He plays with Neil Peart-precision and bulldozer power, providing serious musical muscle. Production-wise, It's their best-sounding studio release by far.    That's not to take away from any of the previous Megadeth lineups, but in the past they had a jazzier, breezier sound which was unique, but not always heavy. \\"Abominations\\" is just full-on complex Euro-thrash without the glass-shattering banshee vocals.     Unlike many recent Megadeth records (which I like) \\"Abominations\\" is beautifully inaccessible. You need to listen to it several times before it truly sinks in, but it rewards a patient ear.       The lyrics and themes on this disc are mostly about today's politically chaotic mess of a planet, which I think brings the best out in Dave. He's a genius when he's angry and focused. Many of his legendary songs are current events-related (\\"Holy Wars\\", \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" and \\"Set The World Afire\\" to name a few.) \\"Abominations\\" fits right into that club.    It does quiet down a bit for the remake of \\"A Tout le Monde\\" (a duet with Lacuna Coil's Cristina Scabbia) but the rest sounds like truckload of 2x4s being fed into a giant table saw. \\"Sleepwalker\\", \\"Washington is Next!\\", and \\"Never Walk Alone... A Call to Arms\\", is as powerful an album-opening 1-2-3 punch as any in the band's catalog.     This isn't just a return to form for Megadeth, it's something heavier with a great big nod to the classic Euro-metal bands of the 80's.
0786158387|5.0|This is a skillfully written treatise on the danger of faith in a world where religious zealots with 14th century ideas have access to 21st century weapons.  The most important lesson I took from this book was that the fundamentalists should not be the focus of our scrutiny so much as liberals and moderates who empower these extremists by complacency in their literal interpretation of the Bible/Koran.  There are so many points of wisdom in this book; I cannot begin to list them.  It is by far tops on my list of \\"must read\\".  The audiobook was narrated by Brian Emerson whom I wish could narrate all the audiobooks I've listen to.  He is clear and precise in his enunciations while thoroughly familiar with the material, revealed by his vocal inflections.  This was a relief after listening to The God Delusion, a rapid British oration by the husband/wife duo that was hard to follow, or the God Is Not Great masterpiece by Christopher Hitchens.  I couldn't make out half of the audiobook due to the poor oration and mumbling of Hitchens.  I will be forced to actually break down and read the book.  I patently await the next Harris book with childlike anticipation.
B000002R9X|5.0|This music sounds as good today as it did back in the day.  My favorite Gentle Giant album with three friends as a close second.  This one however has a better mix and excellent songwriting as well.  If they could have kept this up instead of jumping to \\"Giant for a day\\" I'd still be there biggest fan.
B000DWMYQ8|1.0|The movie is boring. Not done in the Walt Disney tradition. Bambi is a classic movie where actual children voices (not actors) portrayed the young animals. Chicken little voice was of an adult and not of a child. Walt Disney if he were alive would not approve.
B000U55YIS|5.0|This is the ultimate BACCARA collection. It features 50 original RCA recordings from this great Spanish duo. BACCARA were extremely popular all over Europe in the late 70's and early 80's.   Their music is a blend of Euro disco and pop with brilliant melodies. This box set includes all the hit singles (\\"Yes Sir, I Can Boogie\\", \\"Sorry, I'm A Lady\\", \\"Darling\\", \\"Parlez-vous français?\\", \\"The Devil Sent You To Lorado\\", \\"Body Talk\\" \\"Ay, Ay Sailor\\"), all the songs from the albums \\"Baccara\\", \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"Colours\\" as well as rare tracks such as \\"Mad In Madrid\\", \\"Amoureux\\", \\"You And Me\\", \\"El diablo te mandó a Laredo\\", \\"Baila tú\\", \\"En el año 2000\\", \\"Eins plus eins ist eins\\", and \\"Sleepy Time Toy\\". Superb ballads such as \\"Love You Till I Die\\", \\"Don't Play Me A Symphonie\\", \\"Roses In The Snow\\" and \\"Sing Our Love A Lullaby\\" are finally available on CD for the very first time. This 3 CD box set is a must for every BACCARA fan and a great opportunity to listen again to the beautiful voices of Mayte Mateos & Maria Mendiola, the original line-up of BACCARA. Many thanks to Sony BMG Germany for this outstanding BACCARA retrospective.

B000QQFKYE|5.0|\\"Inland Empire\\" out-stranges \\"Eraserhead\\" and I wouldn't have had it be any other way. Bravo, Mr. Lynch. I'll subscribe to your coffee.    Lynch's objective is not to have an audience who can tell what his films are \\"about,\\" or to \\"understand\\" what's going on, but rather to give viewers strangenesses to live through and to be inspired by.    Laura Dern is magnificently mysterious. Her character is as hypnotizing as the moods evoked by the experience of \\"Inland Empire\\".    Every character is beautiful and every frame is a work of art.    Lynch's use of sound, light, color and music are, as they always have been for me in his work, essential elements of modern expressionism.    A x xx i on!
B000IOM1Y6|4.0|What? Me worry? Of course, this is one of the better albums from Parsons & Company. If you don't already own it, you should.<br /><br />The 'remastered' album sounds identical to the original issue (and I listened to and compared the two CDs on very good equipment). The added cuts are of no interest, as all are of lower musical quality than those on the original release. This reissue seems to me to be utterly pointless, intended simply to grab some money from suckers. If you already have the original issue CD, you don't need this one. Save your money.
0394827996|5.0|This is a wonderful book to read at the beginning of the school year for social studies.

0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi is the kind of book that makes you love life a little more. Though quite impropable, the story is told in such a way, that you believe it - at least while you are reading - to have happened in real life for someone.     The book contains some great views on religion an zoology. I would suggest the worlds religious leaders to read it and then meet in the zoo to discuss it. The story is about a tragedy. The book is about friendship and reconciling with the demons inside you and around you.    Enjoy it.

B00005JLT5|5.0|This true story is based on a man who was there. In this insane time, no Pole, Jew or even German could be expected to act consistently sane. It's a fantastic movie, not only for message, but for cinematography, acting, wardrobe, directing and, of course, Poland's greatest composer, Chopin. Chopin's music, again, and again, has kept the spirit of the Polish people going and going, through \\"all\\" of Poland's war's. It kept Wladislaw going too. Great movie! Breathtaking! Chopin piano pieces; Highly recommended!!!
B00005O5CM|5.0|Elle Woods may look really dumb, but you should never be fooled by the appreance of a person. This LA babe would do anything to get her man back, even that means she needs to get into Harvard .Although the story is fictional, but I find it very inspiring. Elle Woods comes to Harvard Law School for the wrong reasons, however she discovered what her heart truely desires through hard work, trust and supports from other good-hearted people. It is a beautiful and funny tale of courage, confidence and miracle. I believe that Legally Blonde is one of the best in its genre, entertaining yet philosophical.     Warning: the sequel is quite unsuccessful in comparison to this masterpiece.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This album is a classic.  Song after song, Kanye just comes wit it.  This is sure to be bumpin in cars all across America for the next couple of months.  Easily the best album of '07.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have been a James Bond fan for a long time.  Though the original Sean Connery movies were before my time, and I was a kid when Roger Moore was making them, I have still enjoyed them.  I always thought Sean would be the best.  (I generally rated Sean as the best and Roger the worst with all others sorted variously in between.)    However, this is without a doubt the best bond and bond movie ever.  I think this is the way the character was meant to be portrayed.  I hope that this is the beginning of restarting the bond franchise.  I would love to see more bond stories with this type of protrayal.
B00005JPD0|4.0|The first point is the acting. It had too small of part for Kilmer, but all the acting is top notched. Denzel plays a guy who is good at his job and is morally upright, who uses his charm to speed up the bureaucratic process.  Caviezel was intense and good. The plot was good. The trouble with the plot was that once Denzel goes back in time, he should not have been able to change the past. For example, the Twelve Monkeys did this well. However, since it was Denzel Washington, the past had to change. What happens to Denzel once he went back in time was pretty obvious to this viewer.    There was a previous reviewer who said the science made perfect sense and was straight-forward. Funny. The movie was about time travel and worm holes. Give me a break. People watch NOVA a few times and think they understand space and time. I have a physics degree, I did not understand their mumblings, and I thought it was silly. They explained the massive energy requirements by having the lights of the city dim when the time machine was in operation (stolen from Weird Science?).    The movie for a while reminded me of \\"Laura\\" in which a detective falls in love with a portrait of the supposedly dead victim. Who wouldn't fall in love with Gene Tierney or Paula Patton? I thought they should have kept working with that idea instead of the time travel, but the problem was that this victim was very dead indeed.    The movie had some very interesting ideas. The car chase scene was very good. How well they tied in the future and the past was very good. The problem was that once you figure out what is going to happen to Denzel and Paula, the movie lost its edge and excitement for me.
B000K7UBTI|3.0|I thought this was a pretty good DVD. I think Marvel does a good job at the animation and also at making it interesting enough for adults and not on an insulting 'kiddy' level. One thing that you will find with these Marvel DVD's (at least the ones I have seen) they are not a 30 minute action fest like you would see on Saturday morning. They are really into telling the story so some might think it moves slowly. I like this cause it is more like a movie and less like a cheap roller coaster ride.
B000148KK2|5.0|....but this MAY be her best album. Diana Krall is undoubtedly today's best known jazz singer, though not the only great, and gorgeous, one around...we are fortunate. She has made a career of singing jazz standards, the masterworks of our greatest songwriters, to absolute perfection, but.....<br /><br />....the numbers here are not well known, or standard. Most of them are her own compositions, written as part of her grieving process for her Mom. But, they are as fabulous as anything Diana has ever done...the title cut will really catch your attention. I have all of Diana's albums...she is a living treasure, and has never sung a wrong note. Highly recommended to every lover of great music.

B000IU3Y1O|5.0|Theres no way to put every great Depeche Mode song out on 1 or even 2 discs. So this release gets 5/5, not for being all-inclusive, but for being a solid little package. The perfect way to turn a friend on to your favorite band. Vol 1 features a solid selection of songs, which provided the building blocks for neo-synthpoppers Ladytron, Freezepop, Goldfrapp, Hyperbubble, Mission Giant, and countless others. If you're a newcomer to old school synthpop, you'll eventually need to get all the DM albums, (of course!), but this is a great place to start + the previously unreleased track is quality and worth the time and money of longtime DM fans. Hey, even if you never listen to the CD, the DVD is worth the price alone!

B000002GYI|5.0|If you don't own a copy of Computer World, your CD collection has a gaping hole in it. Computer World is the blueprint for the sound of the 21st century. When you hear fantastic futuristic electronic sounds on TV commercials, Movies, and even top 40 hits by Gwen Stefani + Justin Timberlake, you're hearing Computer World. If you enjoy modern electronic pop bands like Goldfrapp, Freezepop, PLiD, Komputer, Hyperbubble, Ladytron, Miss Kittin, Madonna, or just about any modern dance music, it's time you hear the sound in it's purest form. So program your home computer to beam yourself into the past, and hear what today sounded like.
B000EZ7ZZE|4.0|This was my first time watching a blu-ray movie and although I saw a difference right away in clarity and color, I thought to myself it wasn't THAT much of a difference, that is until I saw the standard definition clips in the bonus section.    While the difference is not as HUGE if you're using an upconverting DVD player, it is different nonetheless and is noticeable. No type of technology will smooth a scene (or movie) meant to be dark and grainy by design, so I won't hold it against Blu-ray (or any HD format) yet. I'm waiting for another 6 Blu-ray movies to arrive and will update this review once I get to see them.    As far as the movie itself, I mean, it's a videogame based movie, so don't expect \\"Gone with the wind\\" plot and depth. It's an action movie for the sake of action with a cast that is not known for their acting (with a few exceptions). If you're a fan of the videogame, it's great to see the characters show up in the movie and I also liked the continuity from the previous movie. You get to learn some more of what happened in-between. If that seems like an obvious trait for a movie to have, you're not too familiar with movies based on videogames [laughs]...     Overall, it's good for a rental and don't forget the popcorn.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Easily the best of the director's \\"Vengeance\\" trilogy. While all three films give us memorable characters and poweful emotions, OLDBOY carries us through a cohesive and thrilling story, including a great ending. A dark, fantastic puzzle.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|Before Pink Floyd became (deservedly) famous in the mid-70's for Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, and later for The Wall, they were a different band--they were Syd Barrett's band.  Instead of the epic, moody, atmospheric, trippy rock forged primarily by the synergy of Roger Waters and David Gilmour later on in Pink Floyd's existence, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn finds the band making music that is very much of its time (1967).  The music that became known as \\"psychedelic\\" is loosely defined as music that combines creative sonic textures and surprising sounds with bizarre, often whimsical lyrics to either simulate or enhance a drug experience.  With the Beatles just down the hall in Abbey Road Studios recording Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,  The Pink Floyd (named after obscure American bluesmen Pink Anderson and Floyd Council) were on the cutting edge of the British psychedelic scene while recording The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  Now, 40 years later, we're offered a worthy definitive edition of a classic band's classic debut that still endures today as a classic of its genre, thanks to Syd Barrett's unique vision and inimitable songwriting.<br /><br />What is offered in this 3-CD set?  Discs One and Two are Mono and Stereo versions of the album in its entirety.  Many fans are passionately divided as to which version is better: younger fans are most likely accustomed to hearing music in stereo, so a mono mix may seem antiquated.  The Piper at the Gates of Dawn's stereo mix is pretty awesome--I find it a very well-thought-out stereo mix (some from this era weren't particularly well-done), and some great panning effects happen (especially in \\"Lucifer Sam\\" and the finale of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\") that really add to the music's psychedelic impact.  On the other hand, the mono version is just as essential.  At the time of the album's release, British pop music was more geared toward recording radio singles in mono, so a mono version of the album is likely truer to the spirit of the times and more reflective of how bands and producers approached the recording of music when entering the studio.  It certainly sounds thicker, denser, and perhaps a bit more chaotic than the stereo version, which seems to benefit the wild nature of a lot of the album's music.  The great part about this set is that you get both versions, so you can decide for yourself which one you like better.  In my opinion, they're both essential.<br /><br />Disc 3 is composed of bonus material--the A and B sides of Pink Floyd's singles from 1967.  Of these, several (including the classic singles \\"See Emily Play\\" and \\"Arnold Layne\\") were available on the hodgepodgy compilation, [[ASIN:B000002U0D Relics]], but some weren't--the mono and stereo \\"Apples and Oranges\\" and the B-side \\"Candy and a Currant Bun\\" were heretofore quite scarce on CD.  Additionally, Disc 3 offers a couple alternate takes of the classic \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" and an alternate version of \\"Matilda Mother.\\"  Since the early Pink Floyd was definitely a singles-oriented band (they had to have a successful single in \\"See Emily Play\\" to record a full-length LP), these are all essential and worthwhile bonus tracks.  Just listen to \\"See Emily Play,\\" and \\"Apples and Oranges\\"--they're total British psych-pop gold, with Barrett's playful charm set over a quirky and snappy backdrop of irresistible, concise pop.  Fans may be upset that other rarities (i.e. \\"Vegetable Man,\\" \\"Lucy Leave,\\" \\"Two of a Kind,\\" the list goes on...) aren't included on this disc.  Although it would be great to have a definitive CD collection of these rare tracks, it's understandable that they aren't included--most were recorded after the sessions that produced this album and the accompanying singles, so it makes sense that they'd all be bundled together.  Throw on top of the 3 discs of music a beautiful cloth-covered book designed by Pink Floyd design stalwart Storm Thorgerson full of pictures, information, and an8-page reproduction of Syd Barrett's notebooks, and this set fills the bill as a definitive package.<br /><br />As for the music on the album itself, it certainly justifies the fanfare of a 3-disc edition.  The Pink Floyd may not have been the only (or first) British band making psychedelic pop rock at the time, but they sure made some of the best.  \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is a classic opener, with strange radio chatter giving way to Syd Barrett's mysterious and evocative spacey musings sung in his gentle but haunting voice.  The backdrop is dominated by Barrett's reverb-drenched guitar and Rick Wright's crazy organ sounds--two musical elements that typify the classic sound of the whole album.  Barrett's songwriting really shines for its uniqueness of vision and effortless un-self-conscious whimsy on the groovy \\"Lucifer Sam,\\" the hazy childhood loveletter \\"Matilda Mother,\\" and the tripped-out \\"Flaming.\\"  The middle of the album gets really trippy, with the bizarre \\"Pow R. Toc H.\\", filled with weird vocal sound effects, Roger Waters' only track on the album (\\"Take Up Thy Stethescope and Walk\\") and \\"Interstellar Overdrive,\\" one of the early band's most classic tracks.  Through these songs they show a penchant for jamming centered on virtuosity, but more on a restless urge to experiment sonically and chase down some strange and stimulating sounds.  Unlike the tedious jams that typify some music from this era, Pink Floyd pulls it off remarkably well (case in point, the wild ride of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" sandwiched between the song's surf-sounding primary riff).  Barrett's fantastical whimsy returns for the album's last few tracks, especially on the Tolkein-esque \\"The Gnome,\\" which jollily interrupts the droning embers of \\"Interstellar Overdrive,\\" the sublime \\"Scarecrow,\\" and the classic \\"Bike,\\" which sees Barrett rattling off nonsensical details about his life.  The album ends (much like the contemporary Sgt. Pepper) in a chaotic clamor of strange sound effects and percussive noises, marking the end of a particularly distinguished psychedelic journey.  Really, what sets The Piper at the Gates of Dawn apart from some of its contemporaries is Barrett's imagination and intuitive knack for catchy lyrical and musical hooks.  This is music that, despite its weirdness, sticks with you by virtue of quality writing.<br /><br />Who would I recommend this set to?  Die hard fans will definitely want this version--the book is fabulous, both versions of the album are essential, and the bonus material is too irresistible to pass up.  If you're interested in the music but don't want to shell out the extra money, the [[ASIN:B000T05R90 2-disc version]] has both Mono and Stereo versions of the album at a lower price.  If you're new to this classic music and aren't sure you're willing to go for a fancy version, I urge you to at least grab the [[ASIN:B000002UA0 1-disc version]] that's been out for a while.  This is great music and an excellent example of a great musical era that fans of the later Pink Floyd may really appreciate.  Once you're hooked on Pink Floyd's take on British psychedelic rock, be sure to check out some of the other classic albums of the genre, like the Zombies' [[ASIN:B000005YZM Odessey and Oracle]], self-titled [[ASIN:B00000IBDY Tomorrow]], the first two [[ASIN:B0000004F9 Soft Machine]] albums, the Small Faces' [[ASIN:B0009WFDR4 Ogden's Nut Gone Flake]], the Move's [[ASIN:B0000087GF Shazam]], and [[ASIN:B000EHRXRM The World of Oz]], to name a few.

B000TUXL2A|5.0|Mark Knopfler puts out another album that is clean, clear, and perfect. Perfect is not always a compliment in the world of pop music, but, in this case it is. Whenever I listen to a Mark Knopfler release I get all excited to hear some tasty rock guitar, after all he was a guitar god in 1977 after his first record. (Note: they were records and tapes then and not CD's) He is #27 on Rolling Stones top 100 guitar players of all time, for what that is worth.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed, then embarrassed, when I didn't hear awesome electric guitar parts jumping out of the MP3 player. (Like anything really could jump out at you from an MP3 player) It is the writing and how the guitar fits into the song that is MK's artistry. I spent some time going back over my old Dire Straits CDs to revisit those great songs, and that was exactly the point, it has always been about great songs from the first Dire Straits album until the last, it is the writing that makes it all work. Unlike other guitar legends, like the Allman Brothers that lived by the guitar riff, MK survived by writing smart interesting songs. The new CD Kill To Get Crimson is no different, except the guitar playing is a little mote subtle, But, considering he Debuted with Dire Straits 30 years ago that is not surprising. Please don't miss understand me, there is some great guitar playing on this CD it just may take a couple of listens to fully appreciate it.<br /><br />The deep resonant sound of Mr. Knopfler's voice combined with the country/ English folk feel that he honed on his last two albums with Emily Lou Harris, gives this release a warm mellow feel. His choice of words like Kipper and tinker adds an English ambiance.<br /><br />This album is one I knew I would like even before I heard it. Mark Knopfler really shows off what a mature writer and player can do without having to show off. His Writing and playing have a maturity that is lacking in today's new artists. (I couldn't resist saying the last line.)-jeffscotti.com
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Good CD but a little slow towards the end.  They've still got it!  I saw them preform at Pinkpop music festival in Holland and they were great!
B000MRA5NS|4.0|Great picture quality, and a good movie to boot. The movie has a bit of a dark cast, so still not the optimal test disc for a new system, but still quite good. People say \\"wow\\" when they see it.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|It's hard to review Kanye West. For me, his releases and music aren't so much about him but what he does with samples and how he integrates them into his beats and produces new songs. Really, none of the lyrics on this cd impress me. I find that I'm listening more to the beats than I am Kanye. And when I do listen, his lyrics are either hit or miss.<br /><br />What I like most about \\"Graduation\\" is the celebratory sound to it. This isn't like \\"Late Registration\\" or \\"The College Dropout\\". I found those releases had more of a serious tone to it. There really isn't a \\"Slow Jamz\\" on here or a \\"Diamonds from Sierra Leon\\". This is more like graduation; excitement, freshness, a relief. From the cover to the songs, you get the sense that this is a fusion of Hip-Hop, Pop and R&B. The songs that work best on the release are those with a new sound for Kanye- upbeat, fresh, borderline pop. \\"Good Life (ft. T-Pain)\\" is the best track, anthem-style, really well put together and the lyrics work. \\"Champion\\", \\"Stronger\\", \\"Flashing Lights\\" are all exciting and stand-out from Kanye's previous things. \\"Big Brother\\" stands out due to it's subject matter of West's views and admiration of Jay-Z and is one of the more introspective tracks. \\"Homecoming\\" is an interesting collabo between West and Coldplay's Chris Martin. Other songs are good, but more for their beats than anything, including \\"I Wonder\\" and \\"The Glory\\". The other songs get lost due to sounding too similar or lacking the consideration and excitement as these other named tracks.<br /><br />I gave this release four stars because I feel it's hard to really judge a Kanye West cd when he relies so heavily on samples. If you took that element away from his songs, basing it just on his lyrics, this wouldn't be that good of a release at all. I'm also wary of how original you can call it if it has so many samples. But, regardless, it's not bad if you judge it as a total product. Not the best of 2007 but it's good and worth a listen.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|If you love the music that Kanye West makes, he won't disappoint you with this album. The next step was right. If you don't like him, don't bother buying it. Why are you even looking at this review if you hate him?! Wait, why would you buy or write a review of the CD if you never liked Kanye West or his style? *Points at some of the other reviews*    Do yourself a favor and just buy it.

B000GPIPSS|5.0|The way Dracula should be! Bela provided the perfect mix of malice and attraction and forever changed the way people would see vampires. A masterful portrayal, Bela personified the evil of his character and showed no mercy at a time when Hollywood was brimming with feel good flicks. Over the next few years a new horror would arise...a real horror, a man who personified evil and showed no mercy...a man named Adolph Hitler. Watching him speak in public one can only wonder if he had watched Bela's portrayal of Dracula and modeled himself after it. The five stars I gave this film are based on Mr. Lugosi's performance. He was so terribly convincing.....in fact, I thought I saw a shadow moving on the wall just now....but that's absurd, it couldn't.........be???

B000VPUIA6|4.0|\\"Help!\\" has never been released in its original aspect ratio. NEVER. Watch the VHS release, the Criterion laserdisc, or the previous DVD incarations. You can see portions cut off from the edges of the screen. In the past the distributors tried to convince us that \\"Help!\\" was never wide screen--but it wasn't of strict TV proportions either, as evidenced by what you can blatantly see missing at the edges of the screen.    As exciting as the restoration and extras sound, I'm concerned about the fact that NOTHING is being said about the aspect ratio. Which makes me nervous that once again we'll get a full-screen version, with no valid explanation as to why.    APPLE, please clarify!
1841136514|5.0|This book turned out to be much more interesting than I had anticipated.  It is written for a British audience as a \\"how to\\" book to assist those interesting in qualifying to become barristers in the UK.  So, it has chapters on the work of barristers, how to become qualified, work experiences, joining an Inn of Court, the Bar Vocational Course, dining and qualifying sessions, getting a \\"pupillage,\\" alternative careers, and admission after practicising abroad or being a solicitor.  By the time the reader is done digesting this book, you have really gained important insights into the life and activities of being a barrister.  The author (a practicing commercial law barrister) writes with a light and brezzy style which renders even discussion of otherwise boring topics a pleasure to read.  I found the most interesting section of the book to be the 31-pages of essays by all manner of practicing barristers on the topic of \\"A Week in the Life of a Junior Barrister.\\" There are also two interesting introductory chapters on \\"Introduction to the English Bar\\" and \\"The Future of the Bar\\" which are timely given the current \\"reform\\" movements to modify English practice.  At 200 or so pages, the book contains all manner of helpful sources for further information, a glossary of important terms (which proved invaluable), a bibliography, and timetables of key schedules that must be followed.  I probably learned more about the English bar from this unique book than from any of the other sources I have read.
0060989157|3.0|It was quite an interesting read, but each one of Tommy Lee's chapters just made me cringe since every other word was \\"dude\\" or \\"bro\\".

B00026WU82|5.0|If there is one album which everyone should have, whether you're a music aficionado or an anthropologist, it may be Bob Dylan's \\"Highway 61 Revisited.\\" The opening snare shot was the sound of a bomb being dropped upon a generation, and that sound has echoed with the same mind-opening ferocity through the annals of time. In our day and age, it's hard to recognize just how incomparably alien the album seemed when it was released. More than an album, \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" was an alarm clock of the most magically boisterous manner, a powerful awakening to the fact that rock could be more than rhyming verses about your high school crush.  Through unfathomably deep lyrics and tenacious, bluesy arrangements, Bob Dylan irrevocably changed the face of rock music.    Dylan was probably the first artist to bring folk-rock to the public eye, but on \\"Bringing It All Back Home,\\" released in early `65, he alluded to a  possible conversion to electric rock.  He followed through with \\"Highway 61.\\"  Dylan crafted a chariot of musical fire, breaking down the walls with crashing drums and thrusting a stinging guitar at the past of rock music.  At times, Dylan played with such relentless force that one could make a feasible claim that he invented punk rock.  There's no question he had something to say, and nobody could have said it better.  In his slimey \\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\\" Dylan snarled a wake-up call to his generation, flawlessly encapsulating the 1960s: \\"Something is happening here, but you don't know what it is - do you, Mister Jones?\\"    On his previous album, Dylan had taken a brief dip into surrealism with the epically-silly \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream,\\" but he dived in head-first on \\"Highway 61.\\"  With unparalleled versatility, Dylan effortlessly fluctuated between nonsensical absurdist wit and trenchantly observant criticisms.  On \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" he observes, deadpan, \\"The sun's not yellow - it's chicken.\\" One track earlier, on \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" he sang with disarming sincerity and unrestrained hostility.  \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is a grand 6-minute opus that is, quite simply, what rock is all about.  Though it may be rather biased, Rolling Stone magazine voted it the greatest song of all time when they compiled their \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\" list a few years back.  With its grounded yet soaring melodies, \\"vomitific\\" lyrics (as described by Dylan), and sheer ambitiousness, it very well may be.    If anyone will dispute the quality of this album - though no human being has been bold and/or foolish enough as of yet - there is no denying its historical importance.  Folk artist Phil Ochs declared the album \\"impossibly good,\\" adding, \\"How can a human mind do this?\\"  Even the Beatles, who were, at the time, the biggest band in the world, admitted to being intimidated by and in awe of Bob Dylan.  (They attempted to top \\"Highway 61\\" with their 1966 record \\"Revolver.\\") Perhaps most astonishingly, the album was recorded over six days, a miraculous feat.  And though it may not sound as alarmingly fresh and new as it did upon its release, it remains every bit as powerful, ferocious, and bold as it did way back in `65.  If it isn't the best album ever recorded, it's right up there, and there's no disputing that \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" is a required record.

038572179X|5.0|Upon reading `Atonement' one is completely removed from their lives, their places of dwelling and time of departure and transplanted to a place where nothing is familiar yet everything is impressionable.  Being the first novel I've read by the acclaimed novelist Ian McEwan I was immediately made aware of his immense talent.  The tale presented to the reader is one of remarkable effectiveness, one that is truly relatable and believable and in the end of dire importance for its overall moral is one that transcends the boundaries of this prose and cements itself in our very being, in our every interaction and in our constant memory.  Separated into four sections `Atonement' is broken down in such a way as to make the true conclusion all the more shocking and heartbreaking.<br /><br />Part one retells the events on one especially harsh summer day in 1935.  I say `especially harsh' mainly because by the days end events take place that harshly affect the lives of everyone involved.  13-yearold Briony Tallis is a smart and imaginative young girl and she becomes the main focus of our attention as we hear of the day's events.  As she attempts to orchestrate a theatrical production in honor of her brother Leon's arrival home she is met with a few snags and some ominous distractions that put her initial plans on hold and send her into a newfound direction.  As the relationship between her older sister Cecilia and their housekeepers son Robbie begins to take a turn Briony finds herself in the know of a serious misunderstanding that changes the course of everyone's lives.  With their three cousins Lola, Jackson and Pierrot visiting as well as Leon's friend Paul Marshall the house is quite full on the evening in question, so when events take a turn for the worse there are so many more eyes to cast their judgment.<br /><br />Briony is a very interesting character.  I found it truly fascinating as her character unveiled itself with each turning page.  Her immaturity is emphasized by her incessant need to be the mature one despite her inability to do so.  She's lost in her writing, an obsession that causes her to read deeply into matters that aren't her concern and imagine the possibilities no matter how devastating they may become.  She also allows the actions of others to affect her too deeply, finding herself reacting irrationally and this leaves her in a position to do much harm.  It's hard for the reader not to find themselves calling Briony out as the villain here, for it's her needless actions that cause so much pain, but in reality she's nothing more than a young child who was invested in a poor decision.<br /><br />So, with an accusation made and a terrible crime committed we brace ourselves for the second and third parts of the novel where we follow Robbie and Briony respectably as they strive to patch up their lives.  Robbie has been through hell, literally, and in the second part of the novel we follow his journey as he strives to get home from the war.  The horrors he is witness to, the atrocities he is privy to are all sprawled out for us is detail, as is his dire need to be reunited with his lost love Cecilia.  The third part covers Briony's struggles as a nurse during the war, but more importantly her struggles within herself for some ounce of atonement for her sins.  She has grown up since that summer day, not only in age but in understanding, and she is finally able to grasp the seriousness of her lies.  The pain she has caused will never fully be undone, but she desires to do all she can to write them.<br /><br />The novel opens with such a brilliantly conceived idea, and is so effortlessly and elegantly penned that one is immediately engulfed in its design.  I for one could not put it down and read the entire first section in one sitting.  Sadly the second a third sections do not read as briskly, but their importance is all the more secured by the closing section as elderly Briony recounts her actions and the ultimate consequences of them all.  The final pages are chilling to say the least, and are completely unexpected, so much so that the tears running down my face had all but dried before I realized I was crying.<br /><br />`Atonement' is a brilliantly orchestrated tale of pain, despair, loyalty, betrayal and the ultimate yearning to make amends, to find atonement for our sins and attain forgiveness for our souls.  Truly one of the most inspiring and ultimately absorbing novels I've read to date.al pages are chilling to say the least, and are completely unexpected, so much so that the tears running down my face had all but dried before I realized I was crying.      `Atonement' is a brilliantly orchestrated tale of pain, despair, loyalty, betrayal and the ultimate yearning to make amends, to find atonement for our sins and attain forgiveness for our souls.

The Name of The Wind...um...blew me away with its nearly impossible to put down story. The world Rothfuss creates isn't a copy of other fantasy worlds you may have visited and if he's been influenced by other writers you wouldn't know it from his original take on a well-worn genre.

B000002UAX|3.0|You know, I like The Beatles quite a lot.  Really I do.  I swear.  I have every album.  Even the terrible, awful, very bad soundtrack to Yellow Submarine.  All of it.  And I gotta tell you, this record is pretty low down in the rankings, and it deserves every bit of it.  If I live forever I may never understand the considerable enthusiasm that people seem to have for this album, and for the odd person considering buying this, I'll try to describe my thinking.    First off, the general stuff.  This is The Beatles.  If you're not familiar with at least the term, you've possibly been living in a cave, but they're pretty much the prototypical rock band we see today, but back when that was new and artistic and good and junk.  They're pretty good at what they do, to put it mildly.  If you know who they are, you should know there are two kinds of The Beatles - the early and the late.  This is the late.  This is not \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"Love Me Do.\\"  This is \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\\"  If you like the first and not the last, you should probably skip this.    Now, to the meat of the review, which is where I explain why I'm giving this supposed masterwork precisely three stars and not a glimmer more.  First off, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought The Beatles were supposed to be A BAND.  You know - one of those funny little creatures with multiple musicians collaborating to create a result.  This doesn't sound like a band.  This sounds like somebody took four solo records, mashed them untidily into a blender, and set the thing to musical puree.  You know when John Lennon was running things and when Paul McCartney was running things and when George Harrison was running things and you'll let me know if you catch poor Ringo.  That's bad.  While individual fans will argue with you, I think folks with a broader viewpoint can tell you that the individual Beatles members were never as good separately as they were together, and they seem to be together not-so-much of the time on this recording.    Which is another problem.  As the educated in the subject know, at the time this album was produced, the band was kind of fighting a little bit.  Not getting along in the best of ways.  Drifting apart.  Having a sissy slap-fight.  Whatever you want to call it, there was no confluence of views and intent, and everybody wanted their stuff on the record.  The result?  A rather predictable bloated mass, most of which is easily second-tier stuff, if that.  Revolution 9?  Seriously?  Come on, people.    It's worth noting that their producer - George Martin - was very much in favor of jettisoning a large amount of this detritus and releasing a single, tighter recording, and I have to say I agree with him.  There's a good record in here SOMEwhere, but finding it is a challenge.  There's not much here that would cut muster on the radio, compared to the album size, and an awful lot of stuff that I'd be tempted to cut to make a record more along the lines of Revolver, which was tight and firmly rooted in the mold of accessible pop music.  Which is another problem - this record is arty, arrogant, and generally thinks an awful lot of itself and doesn't go to much trouble to be accessible.  It features The Beatles at some of their most arrogant and navel-gazing (i.e. Glass Onion), which is never, ever attractive in a band.    Mostly, I'm disappointed in this album.  I would never recommend that anybody purchase it at it's frequently-suggested-price of $30.  If you can find it for less - $15 would be ideal - that's when I'd pull the trigger, but honestly, unless you're a Beatles completist like me, or you really want to pull the quality tracks out of the muck (everybody has their favorites, but mine include Martha My Dear, Helter Skelter, Back in the U.S.S.R., and some others), this is one of the few Beatles CDs I can say really isn't worth the effort.  Revolver and Sgt. Peppers' are masterpieces and a wonderful place to start for any new listeners.  I'd steer clear of this unless you're established and you've got a firm idea of what you're getting.
B000SQJ27I|5.0|Manu chao really blew it out of the water with la radiolina. \\"El hoyo\\" is my favorite. Viva Manu!
B0000074FL|4.0|This album is great...with the exception of maybe \\"Fats\\", this is a sold effort....true, some of the songs may not generally flow together, but this is not a concept album!   Look at it as a collection of songs.......and certainly some stronger songs make up for the weaker ones........certainly It's Getting Dangerous is one of Phil's best efforts.........     The Thunder and Lightning album?......with the exception of Sun Goes Down, it just sounds like another bland 80's metal album.....definitely not on par with their earlier efforts and not this one......
B0007MWZEK|5.0|We are very happy with the performance of the Swivel Sweepers. No problem getting up tracked in dirt, crumbs on the kitchen floor and under the table. The sweepers are very handy and easy to use. The battery stays charged for several uses. A very smart buy.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This Album just genuinely feels good. I skip one track. Really good album.  Blue & Exile is still my favorite of the year soo far though.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This movie was so far advanced for it's time-it is still 30+ years later,the best racing movie ever produced.The racing scenes in this movie could not be duplicated today, without computer imaging faking, most of the scenes.The photography work was so innovative,it truly gave you the perception,the essence, of speed, that is so hard to capture.Having raced formula cars myself for a couple of years,I can say without hesitation or reservation,that this movie is the closet thing to actually siiting in the seat of a formula car you'll ever experience.The 2nd disc was very enlightening and equally entertaining.I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys racing, in any way shape or form.Simply-the best.James Garner was great in the  movie,but in the trailers, it's mentioned Steve McQueen, was first offered the role.I'd love to have seen McQueen in this role.
0307341550|3.0|I preface this review with: This was a book I would have never have read had I not been part of a book club.<br />Although I did enjoy this book, and read it in about two days, I cannot give it any more than 3 stars.  It was well written and the story was sound however I kept feeling like the author was trying to parallel too many aspects of the main characters' life into the murders.  Even though they panned out in the end (don't worry, I won't spoil it) it wasn't fulfilling for me.  There was no \\"ah ha\\" moment at the end.  It was more of a, \\"oh, well that makes sense.\\"
B000TFINY6|5.0|I love that Lost is coming to Blu-Ray. Now I get to see one of the best looking shows on tv in High Def. I am so glad I got a PS3.
B00006JIA4|4.0|Volumes I and III are great, the middle CD not very exciting.  If to do over, I would have selected one of the other greatest hits albums.  Nonetheless, Queen rocks.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|he gives Daft Funk due credit. he paid them.  he's not stealing, plus he's exposing millions to  their work.
B000SQJ27I|4.0|When Manu Chao did a live set on KCRW a week before the release of \\"La Radiolina\\", Nic Harcourt observed that the new record has a more aggressive feel to it.  Manu replied that in the six years since his last record, the world has changed a lot.  The world too, has become more dangerous and aggressive.      Radiolina does have several songs that are more electric guitar driven.  Another new element (at least from my recollection) from the opening track, is an electric banjo that gives the music an almost hillbilly Appalachian feel not present on the previous albums.    In addition to a fast paced guitar groove on several songs, Chao brings out his flamenco roots more overtly on \\"me llaman calle\\" and \\"La vida es una tombola/Si yo fuera Maradona\\".    It may just be synchronicity, as I bought Cindy Sherman's new retrospective book with this CD, or it may be a direct influence, but the song \\"Bleeding clown\\" may have been influenced by one of Cindy Sherman's photographs.    People complained about Manu's past records beginning to sound repetetive, even after just a few listens.  Manu is fond of self cannibalization when writing songs.  That technique worked quite well on his first two records, but it does get tiresome here. If there's a flaw to Radiolina, it's that he uses the same groove on nearly a half dozen songs.  I remedied this by picking my favorite song in which he uses the same groove, and only transferring that song to my ipod.  This is a different way of saying the album would have been just fine with 15 or 16 tracks instead of 21.     Manu Chao is usually lumped in with \\"world music\\".  I hereby invent the term \\"Pan Latin Groove\\", as Manu skillfully blends Spanish music with other Latino styles from all over the globe.    While Radiolina does have a more aggressive feel to it on several songs, as with his past records, Manu infuses a heavy dose of angry politics.  There's also a melancholia in his music (as there is in much of music in the vast Spanish/Portuguese diaspora).  Ultimately, Manu also shares a message of hope in the song \\"Otro mundo\\" (other world), in which he sings he dreamed about a different and better world.    Overall, a more polished, mature sound; a CD I'd strongly recommend in spite of the repetitive groove on several songs.
B0000696I1|5.0|After purchasing the first two Ninja Turtle movies, I thought, what the heck.  My son loves this movie as well as the first two.  He can't seem to get enough.
B000002I97|5.0|I had this album when it came out.  Some of it is deep, thoughtful, painful and some is delightfully silly.  Prines writing remains true, core and masterful. Two main stores in Manhattan did not have this in stock- boy, was I happy to find it here in CD form.  \\"Angel From Montgomery\\" is a time-tested classic and I had to hear it from the originator himself. Getting this CD stratched an itch I had for a while....  Thanks John!  PS Man; did I have good taste back when I was young....lol
B000VECAEO|5.0|Many Seinfeld fans were disappointed to see the show end, but it's very understandable that Jerry wanted to end while the show was on top rather than wait until they ran out of ideas.    This season is filled with episodes that contain that classic Seinfeld style of humor.  Many people who don't like Seinfeld don't appreciate how complex and well written the story lines can be.  The Betrayal (or Backwards episode) seems to be dreaded by many but is a favorite for me.  I see it as a well written and thought out episode that ventures into a much more daring style of writing.  Show me a movie or TV show that comes even close to this format (flashbacks DON'T count) and still maintains a funny and engaging plot.    The final episode was a disappointment for me, and I will also admit that it fell short of the standards set by the previous episodes.  But I also applaud their ability to bring the show to a close and still incorporate so many of the extras that made appearances over the years.    Though maybe not the best, this season is still one of the best of the Seinfeld show.  Even if you consider this a hit or miss season, those that hit, are absolutely hilarious.  The goofy, unrealistic, off the wall style is what the show was all about.  Pick up a copy of this as soon as it comes out.
B00000JY1X|5.0|I love those albums that start off with an upbeat tune. This one has Absolutely Cuckoo....what a beginning. It took me weeks before I got through the first CD, getting stuck on All My Little Words (the great banjo sound) for days, then Come Back To San Francisco (simple electric guitar melody), then Book of Love (a few weeks...how about those refrains...easy to sing along and click together with the prior lyrics..you can read to me anytime).  I'm leery about going onto the next two CDs. Not prepared for a let down; maybe not prepared for more great sounds. I have listened to \\"i\\" which was pretty good as well. I found about the album from On My Nightstand, a weekly column by Dylan Foley in the Star-Ledger. He interviews authors to see what they're reading. Well, one author had read a book about the making of the album. Some day I'll read the book.     5 stars and haven't listened to the 2 other CDs. Found just one other person who knows about the album. Where are the rest???
B00002DEGZ|5.0|Currently, I own 3 sets of the Mozart Piano Concertos (two modern instrument ones - Anda & Schiff; and the Gardiner-Bilson set).  I must agree w/ the reviewers who rated this HIP set 5* - my main reason for posting is to help 'counteract' the ridiculous rating of 2* given, primarily because the CDs did not sound good on the highway in a car!  I play a lot of CDs in my car, but rarely classical music because the dynamic range needed to appreciate these performances just will not work on a highway; if I wanted to hear a lot of classical music in the car, I'd probably 'burn' my CDs to CD-Rs using software in which I could compress the dynamic range, so 'lows' & 'highs' can be heard comfortably.
0345494997|5.0|I have studied the work and bio of Frank Lloyd Wright for many years, even traveling to his Western headquarters, Taliesen West, and touring homes he built in four cities.  I was well aware of his strengths and faults, but little has been published about the women in his wife, other than his domineering, smothering mother and his strident, domineering third (and last) wife. (I'm counting Mamah Borthwick, his lover for about a half-dozen years, as a second wife, since they would have married if his first wife had granted him a divorce; he and Borthwick lived together for several years).    Wright's towering ego is well known and well documented.  By choosing to look at Wright and his work through the eyes of Mamah, his lover, in this fictionalized historical tale, Horan brings new insight into the demons and angels that inspired his vision.  Wright's well-documented narcissism and inability to control himself personally is examined as well, but not as the fatal flaws offered by most biographers, but as components of an immensely complex and genius personality.    Mamah's (first) husband was first to see Wright's vision but Mamah was the one to embrace it wholly as Wright set about building them a home in Oak Park, not far from his own house.  Wright was a star on the rise at that time, accepting commissions almost faster than he could manage them, but the affair he and Mamah embarked upon, which caused her to abandon her children, led to considerable scandal and major setbacks to his business.    Mamah was a recognized scholar and intellect until she was subsumed into a loveless marriage by the conventions of the time.  In Wright she found the outlet for her passions and the independence she longed for, and the support and acceptance to rebuild her professional life, which became linked with that of the feminist Swedish scholar Ellen Keyes.  Mamah's story, and that of the feminists of her time, is largely lost to history, and for reminding us of those seminal and important figures alone Horan deserves a deep bow.    Horan's work also exumes many litle-known facts about Wright and his times: his love for rural Wisconsin, where he grew up; his fascination with Japan and business in buying and selling Japanese antiguities; and his admiration for the classic Tuscan homes of northern Italy.  As this book documents the times in which Wright was shaping his own vision with the help and guidance of Mamah, we can better understand the architecture for which he became so famous.    For those familiar with Wrights biography, the tragic end to his and mamah's affair is well known.  For others, it will come as a shock.  Horan is simply masterful in describing the events as they must have occurred.    I enjoyed the book tremendously, but I have one major quibble: Horan offers little documentation for her narrative for the reader who might want to learn as much as she does.  As one generally familiar with the story I find it authemtic, but an appendix elaborating on the sources Horan used would add to the book's credibility.
031236198X|4.0|Found it to be both entertaining and educational, it's a perfect balance of real world application packaged in an easy to read book.  I would pickup Leading Change for more information on the items that are discussed in this book.
0618680004|5.0|As a child I attended church, and sunday school. Later after much questioning I came to the belief that there was no God. I studied comparative religion, anthropology, and ethics amongst other things at uni, which confirmed this view. With a seemingly endless array of mythologies, and belief systems its evident humanity is capable of believing almost anything given the right motivations and social milieu. I hadn't really thought much of this in the many years since my degree, but in recent years I've been more concerned that the propensity to unreason humanity displays is probably bringing us closer to a potential crisis point (assuming much obviously- including that we haven't reached it yet). The Dawkins book does a great deal to illustrate this, citing a great deal of anedotal, evidence, and philosophically based reasons. He is his usual passionate self, and its clear he's tired of having to be on this path at all, I'm sure he'd much prefer to be getting on with his first passion, evolution. Anyway sorry for the biography but I thought it best you understand where my rating for this book came from. The thought it most clearly leaves me with is - bronze age myths and stories are not complex, or consistent enough to be basing a social system on in the 21st century, the power at our finger tips makes this more than a little problematic.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|IMO, this is one of the most interesting Iced Earth albums ever to come out, very different but very iced earth at the same time...Ripper fits like a glove on this album, alot better then he did for TGB. One of the years best albums...Buy Now
B000RG1FMO|4.0|THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST ALBUM OF ANY ARTIST IN YEARS, I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I FELT COMPELLED TO ACTUALLY BUY AN ALBUM, BUT THIS DOES IT, CREATIVE LYRICS, LYRICS THAT ACTUALLY SAY SOMETHING OTHER THAN DRUGS, SEX AND VIOLENCE, AND MEMORY MAKING BEATS! 50'S ALBUM IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE COMPARED TO THIS, AND I'M NOT A HUGE KANYE FAN, I LIKED HIM BEFORE THIS, BUT THIS ALBUM TOOK HIM TO A NEW LEVEL, ITS ON PAR WITH 50'S FIRST AFTERMATH ALBUM, THATS HOW GOOD THIS IS!
1857988094|5.0|at first, i was wondering how in the world did this book have a name like that... after reading it, i can defitely quote \\"I AM LEGEND\\" to many things that go on in our ordinary life... the book was at first a thriller, then a mystery, then a romance and all of this put together makes this book such a wonderful treat. Enjoy it..
B000EWBC42|4.0|The Japanese mini LP versions of CDs has been an example of technology, craftmanship and an incredible eye to detail.  Granted sometimes the printing on these releases requires a magnifying glass to read, but it is clear and legible.  LP covers were an art form and many covers demanded the size of these covers to convey the art properly.  Many of us who have the originals are probably not going to buy the mini LP.  However, many of these discs now come with upgraded remastering and bonus tracks to entice us to buy them, anyway.    This release is the epitome of the mini LP product.  With the package completely unfolded, this release is an incredible sight to see.  This is one that you would buy, even if you have the original LP release.  It is that good.    The attention to detail is also present in the CDs themselves.  The sound is better than the domestic release and has been put back into the original 3 LP format.  Now, this is good and bad.  With three CDs, you are getting an exact replica.  From an enjoyment point of view the domestic 2 CD release makes sense.  Also, in the 3 CD format, Discs 2 & 3 have a fade in of the last few seconds that were on the prior CD, just like it was on the LPs.  What may have been convention years ago is now an annoyance.  The 2 CD version does away with this overlap.    So, if you have the domestic release, don't get rid of it.  Use it for your listening enjoyment and have this release for the pure visual enjoyment.    5 out of 5 stars for the packaging.    4 out of 5 stars for superior sound, but annoying fading of the music between discs.
1594489505|5.0|I found this novel not only to be realistic, but also horrifyingly true. I am from the middle east and have heard stories like this that were actually true... not very common but, yes it happens.
B000OLGCHA|2.0|I admit, I am a die-hard collector of all things Harry Potter, so I can't be too upset with my purchase, but this CD is NOT something I listen to for the fun of it. It doesn't compare to John Williams' editions at all (despite previous reviews stating it comes close). Let's hope the rumors that John will come back for HP7 are true!!!
B000O75F7C|4.0|Fear of a Blank Planet is shorter than the last couple Porcupine Tree albums, and a bit more proggy in its leanings. It has only six tracks, although one is over seventeen minutes long. They've always been a progressive band, but generally a little catchier, with some more accessible songs. There are a couple moments like this on Blank Planet, but it generally doesn't stray far from its standard sound. The album's a bit heavy-handed with the message. It's about how today's youth are basically brainwashed by the media and prescription drugs, which is maybe topical but not really that edgy a thing to say, so it comes off a bit lame. There's also a bit of dullness to some of the lyrics that try to relate to the message. It's not bad, it just doesn't take the band to new places and is a bit of a disappointment.    \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" sticks closely to the theme as you might expect of a title track, and is a reasonably good song. It flows right into \\"My Ashes\\" which has a shift in perspective and a softer tone. It's pleasant, but not terribly interesting musically. \\"Anesthetize\\" is the long focal point of the album, with several different movements, varying between louder and quieter parts. \\"Sentimental\\" is another quiet song. Porcupine Tree just doesn't rock as hard as they have previously. The chorus of \\"Way Out of Here\\" goes a long way to make up for some of the record's other shortcomings. By itself, it's really not too amazing, it just grabs your attention and makes it seem like the album isn't quite so boring. \\"Sleep Together\\" has a string section and other such elements that add to the attempted grandiosity that comes with this sort of music, but it's too little too late. If you're a fan of the band you'll find some stuff to like, but I would recommend In Absentia or Deadwing to a new listener first.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Worthwhile(esp for Blues fans) CD and DVD - the music is fantasic but the DVD is incredible, worth twice the price of admission! The DVD is a must watch even if you're not a fan of Blues music.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanye's new album is the bomb. Check out the snippets on the Amazon page...you'll like it. Go get the album. Way better than 50's!
B00004SZWD|5.0|This CD highlights the genius of Stevie Wonder.  After all these years, this CD (formerly album, maybe 8-track) still sounds good.  It will take you back!
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This is an incredible album. When I heard the first track, 'Good Morning', the beat sent chills down my back and one of the punchlines was sick \\"I'm the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary.\\" The next track 'Champion', is upbeat and leads into the mega-hit, 'Stronger'. The next single 'Good Life featuring T-Pain' is going to be another hit, it has an awesome uptempo beat and is a real banger. Then there's 'Can't Tell Me Nothing', the hood favorite where Kanye explains his past temper tantrums. 'Flashing Lights' is an amazing track with very cool production. 'Everything I Am', is a song about how your shortcoming actually make you unique. I think my favorite song right now is 'Glory', I love the beat, it really gets me pumped. 'Homecoming' describes his hometown of Chicago in a very interesting way and 'Big Brother' explains the ups and downs of his relationship with the boss, Jay-Z. Overall, I LOVE this album and it just thumps in my car and I just can't help but nod my head and sing a lot. If you don't have it, go out and buy it!
B00000DLV1|5.0|This is a masterpiece of contemporary music. PNYC is a very complex album, full of arrangements that goes to deep obsesive levels. No matter what kind of music do you really like. Everyone who cares about music should hear this album, and watch the dvd concert...many, many times. Pity i can´t give them more than 5 stars.
B000OQF6N6|1.0|I didn't expect much from once great and famous group which I have been  a \\"die for\\" fan of, I bought it for my girlfriend as she tought she still loved them. Not true anymore.     he used to be a little boy  So old in his shoes  And what he had chosen was his voice  What's a boy supposed to do  The killer in him was the killer in...
B000F7CMRM|1.0|This movie was staggeringly boring. And no...It's not because I don't understand the subject matter. It's another Clooney message movie, but this one can't really decide what message it wants to convey. Someone needs to remind George that a movie should actually have a plot and a at least one character that the audience will give a damn about.  What a waste of time and popcorn.
B000Q6GUW0|3.0|I mean come on, we all know this is hands down one of the best shows ever, the character dexter morgan, debra, rita, doakes, laguerta, all of them are great characters, well written, with depth, etc, etc, etc; we all know that, that being said..., the dvd's are CRAP!, for lack of a better word, the menus look like a playstation 1 game, they're horrible!!!!!, deppressing, saddening, boring; and the episodes themselves!!!!!, come on!!!!!, the don't even start with the always familiar \\"previously on dexter...\\", no!, they start with a very dissapointing \\"...viously on dexter...\\", what the f#@$!!!!, i thought it was my dvd player, it wasn't my friends!!!!, not even burnt the right way!, again, come on!!!!, and the features?, there's only one of the three they offer!!!!, and two episodes of brotherhood, who the f#*% cares about those?!, come on!!!!!!!!!!!, so after waiting and waiting for this show to come out on dvd, i'm giving it 3 stars because the show itself is amazing, but that's it!, if you like the show, fine, buy it, but don't expect to be blown away, you won't
0440238609|5.0|This series is one of my favorites of all time; up there with Harry Potter and Madeline L'Engle's works. The world Pullman creates is rich and full of life, and the characters pop out. These books are not light, fluffy reads, however. There is darkness, death, war, and some pretty heavy philosophical and theological themes throughout. It can be read and understood by children, but I would recommend parents read them first and decide if they feel their children can handle some of the book's themes. I would say 10 is around the age that children might truly begin to appreciate this series.    Many people seem to feel these books are anti-God, and if one reads the series, it becomes quickly apparent where that opinion comes from. However, these books are NOT anti-God or anti-afterlife... they are ANTI-RELIGION. Some may feel that these are one and the same, but they are not. The \\"God\\" featured in the book is not actually God, but a tyrant who was the first created, and CLAIMED to be God to those who came after. It is a commentary on the controlling and sometimes cruel nature of religion; not of God. In order to appreciate this theme, one must look beyond the surface of what appears and find the metaphor buried within. Really, the reality of God is left open to interpretation by the reader. There is also a predominant theme throughout the series of an obsession with \\"loss of innocence\\" (attaining puberty) and \\"sin\\" by the religious figures in the book. This is another commentary on religion's control over the masses.    Truly, Pullman has created a beautiful fantasy world and a thrilling tale which happens to be wrapped around a thread of philosophy. If nothing else, it is worth discussing and thinking about, even if one does not agree with the ideas being presented. The characters are varied and deep, each with a culture and background of their own. There is Iorek, the armoured bear... Lee, the sharpshooter from Texas... tiny warriors who ride dragonflies, live only 7-10 years and attack with poison spurs on their heels... witches, gypsies, and so many more. It is a little science fiction meets fantasy, with strange and wonderful creatures. It is a very real story (excusing the fantasy elements, of course). Life isn't fair and there aren't always picture-perfect endings... such is reality. The story is fairly dark, but there is strength and obstacles overcome and overwhelming love, as well.
0307346609|5.0|Ok I admit it, I love apocalyptic fiction (not sure why) and in particular the Zombie genre. I'm such a dork.     But man, this book was fantastic and very smart - rather than reading like throwaway pulp trash, WWZ is written from the perspective of people from all walks of life across the globe, recounting the history of the rise of the zombie horde, the \\"Great Panic\\", the subsequent resistance and the seeming end of the assault from the living dead. It sounds goofy but it was *so engrossing* I kept looking to see how much was left because I didn't want it to end. I could have read another 300 pages of these \\"interviews\\" easily.  If it's a genre you enjoy, I can't recommend it enough.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Until i started listening to Kanye Nothing really impressed me in the rap world it all seemed to be the same thing. Kanye mixed it up using artist from different genres and has some great production. Don't get me wrong I love hip hop, but for me Kanye, Common and Talib Kweli are the best rappers out there today because they can spit like crazy. Oh and i can't forget my boy Dr. Dre. This album is solid and i like this one better than late registration and anyone who likes hip hop should pick this up.
0307387178|5.0|I read the description of this book and thought \\"ok, some guy goes camping and dies in the woods, big deal. maybe I will read it anyway\\"  I am glad I did.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of people that do not like Chris McCandless.  There were many comments about how he was not smart enough to be in the woods by himself, how he was not prepared, he didn't take this trip seriously enough, etc.  I was one of them.  In the first few pages of the book I was saying to myself, \\"Of course this guy is gonna die, he's a knucklehead\\"  I understood where all the negative comments were coming from.  Or so I thought.<br /><br />As I continued reading I was drawn into the story.  I could relate to his adventures and choices.  Not that I have ever stepped foot into Alaska, but I have done some pretty stupid things in my life.  Well I say they are stupid now, but at the time I was able to feel them and understand those choices in a different way.  I was young and could not be beaten or taught.  I knew it all.<br /><br />I think thats why there were so many people that criticized what Chris did.  They saw the younger version of themselves and it scared them. Or maybe they see Chris doing something they were afraid to do but always wanted to do. I know thats what happened with me.  I also realized that I have four young sons and they are already showing thrill-seeker tendencies.  Hopefully I will prepare them well for their adventures in life.<br /><br />By the end of this book I had really grown to respect Chris McCandless.<br />He was very intelligent, of the highest ethics and morals, did not believe that big government was a good thing, and he realized that he did not need many of the things that we take for granted.  He could leave our world and forge a new place in nature.  It was a learning experience for him.  He accomplished a lot.  Its too bad he didn't learn one of the most important rules until it was too late, an accomplishment means nothing if you can't share it with someone you love.<br /><br />This is a great book and I highly recommend it.eat book and I highly recommend it.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|This is a very impressive collection of bonus features. However, if you haven't purchased it yet, you may wish to hold off.  A \\"Titanic 10th Anniversary\\" DVD is planned for release in November, and may have more content.
B00005J73X|3.0|Bon Jovi : 'One wild night'  I don't normally like live cd's but this has a great collection of songs performed live which makes it a very good compilation.   It also includes a studio track 'One wild night 2001' version 2.  I still however prefer Bon Jovi: 'Tokyo road' which came at the same time and is the 2nd greatest hits album after Cross road.  However copies of 'Tokyo Road the best of Bon Jovi' are very hard to get.
0670034711|1.0|The amazing fact about this book it that was still on the bestseller list after 117 weeks. I was out to dinner with some business associates and it was recommended heartily too me. I am more of a fiction reader, but I occasionally dabble in memoirs, biographies and essay books. So I decided to take a shot with Eat, Pray, Love.    I picked up Elizabeth Gilbert's \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" at a discount store. Even at the discount, I felt ripped off. If I had gone to the library and checked it out free I still would have felt ripped of for the price of gas.    The book starts with the author's mega-painful divorce. Now, divorce is not happy for anyone at any time. It symbolizes the breakdown of a relationship that was once so strong and loving that the two people involved said those immortal words: \\"I do.\\" I feel bad for anyone that has to go through it.    What was so painful about this divorce that we could see? Did he beat her, get drunk, or emotionally abuse her? Did he cheat? Simply fall out of love? Nope, the man's only fault was to want a baby with his wife.    This is the point where I internally sighed and bravely plowed forward despite my reservations. Don't people talk about this sort of thing before they get hitched? I mean come on, we are living in a day and age where women have choices and are not simply married off to the man of her father's choice for some sheep. Throughout the dating, the engagement, the wedding preparations the mention of kids never came up? Kids are the one thing that cannot be compromised in a relationship. You can't have half a kid. If she had any doubts, she should have said so.    The author ends up in another relationship soon after her divorce. This falls apart as does the author herself. Luckily, she gets a large advance to gallivant around the globe and write a novel about it. We should all be so lucky!    Travels to Italy is the eat portion of the novel where she enjoys great food with a colorful stable of Italian characters. Pray takes place in an ashram in India where the author has a revelation where she actually \\"speaks\\" to God. In Bali, she finds her balance (and, of course a new lover).    The writing is easy to read and the author attempts to be witty. However the selfish \\"me, me, me\\" tone of the book is just too much to take. It also wraps up just a little too nicely. Woman gets paid to escape problems that are not that bad, travels the globe, gets the chance to see and experiences things some will only ever dream of and it's all tied up with a neat little boyfriend bow at the end.

1567315682|1.0|There is a silly book called A Millionaire Next Door, and one of the authors wrote an even sillier book called The Millionaire's Mind. They interviewed a bunch of millionaires to figure out how these people got rich. Visibly they came up with bunch of traits. You need a little bit of intelligence, a lot of hard work, and a lot of risk-taking. And they derived that, hey, taking risk is good for you if you want to become a millionaire. What these people forgot to do is to go take a look at the less visible cemetery -- in other words, bankrupt people, failures, people who went out of business -- and look at their traits. They would have discovered that some of the same traits are shared by these people, like hard work and risk taking. This tells me that the unique trait that the millionaires had in common was mostly luck.     By Nassim Nicholas Taleb

B00005OWEG|1.0|I know that critics liked this movie about Viet Nam, but I have to disagree.  This movie is nothing, I repeat nothing, like Viet Nam. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  If they wanted to know what Viet Nam was like, I would recommend Oliver Stone's 'Platoon,' because that was as close to my experience of Viet Nam that I have seen.  Stay away from 'Apocalypse Now,' it is so unrealistic it borders on fantasy, and is very disrespectful to the American soldier.  If I could rate this lower, I would rate this \\"ZERO.\\"
B000HT386M|3.0|When I watch something with Adam Sandler in it, I want it to be kinda stupid and kinda crude with just a smidgen of goodness sewn into the script somewhere along the line.  I thought I was getting that in Click and maybe I did a little, but not as much as you would expect.  This is not Happy Gilmore.  This is not The Wedding Singer.  This is Click, Adam Sandler on Prozac.  Very formulaic.  Almost seemed written to where anyone could have played Sandler's part.<br /><br />Michael Newman is a ditzy workaholic (God this has been done so many times before!) who thinks that he must put his job before his gorgeous wife and his two children to get ahead and make everything perfect.  Juggling work and swim meets and the day to day rigors of life, Michael heads to Bed, Bath & Beyond to pick up a universal remote for the television.  When he enters the Beyond section of the store he runs into the wonky-haired Morty (Christopher Walken) who gives him a prototype remote control to manage everything.  Literally.  Everything.  The remote works on Michael's life.  He can pause, mute, rewind and fastforward everything.  Wow.  Only a few million problems.  Morty (Mortis) is the Angel Of Death. And having the ability to alter your life has some serious repercussions.  At one point, and this actually makes the film utterly ridiculous, Sandler's character fastforwards through sex with Kate Beckinsale.  Yeah.  Right!  IDIOT! Well, one thing leads to another and the remote starts to automatically fastforward though everything that should be improtant.  Newman winds up a fat, lonely, divorced old man who has achieved success that he can hardly remember attaining.  Sad.  Yeah.  Jeez.<br /><br />There are a few fatal flaws in Click that make it subpar.  One, the writing, hell, even the casting is off.  Sure, Christopher Walken plays a great weird character, but he looks like Robin Williams in Flubber.  Secondly, Kate Beckinsale and Adam Sandler, as a married couple?  What universe is this?  Kate Beckinsale is absolutely stunning.  Adam Sandler is Forrest Gump.  And why are their children pretty much the same age?  Adam is mean-spirited in this just one too many times and the whole \\"I hate my job but I've gotta succeed for the family\\" scenario is downright cliche.  Most people hate their jobs! Duh!  Life sucks, get a helmet! You don't sacrifice your family for money, everyone knows that, but it takes Sandler the entire movie and his entire life to realize that.  All in all the ending before the actual ending is way too depressing for an Adam Sandler movie and then they wipe it out as a dream.  Anyone see the flaws here?  My creative writing teacher back in high school told us that if we ever ended a story like that she would beat us about the head and neck.  Duh!  This is simple Hollywood tripe with a lot of special effects thrown in and a very mundane storyline.  Not unwatchable, but pretty f*cking stupid, if you want to know. I guess I'll stick with Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer for my Adam Sandler.<br /><br />Deal with it!is absolutely stunning.  Adam Sandler is Forrest Gump.

B000ENC6XM|4.0|I really liked this movie and the style/look of it.  I don't read comic books or graffic novels but love movies and I really liked this film.  I can't speak from an adaptation point of view.    As for the HD side of things.  Absolutely, one of the best discs I've seen to date out of about 20+.  It is virtually flawless even in darker scenes and the entire movie is sharp (but not overly sharp-edge enhanced)and the colors are really nice.  Lots of scenes that I now notice more of stuff in the backgrounds at 56\\" HD.   The DD+ soundtrack is great and I'm sure the DDTrue is amazing eventhough most of us can't decode it yet.  It has tons of extra material that I don't care about myself, but it's there.  Perfect video transfer- I love HD.  Give it a shot if you're choosing your free HD DVD's from promotion.  BTW- it took a good 2 months to get mine, but don't give up.
B000024D4R|4.0|Luis Mejia (son): Pink Floyd's global success had already been well stablished with the previous Wish You Were Here and, mainly, The Dark Side Of The Moon. It seems that the contrast that make this three albums is really high, while The Dark Side Of The Moon is far more commercial, light, with a comprehensible psychedelia and possessing an accessible structure and a set of easy compositions, while Wish You Were Here keeps its commercial tendencies but is far more mature and intelectual, although still light, while the following Animals went being a metaphoric, still intelectual and complex concept album about society figures: the the abusive, schizoid business man (Dogs), the over controlling politic figure (Pigs), and the laid back person, abused by these two other figures, being too unconfident to do something about it (Sheep).<br /><br />The accussing and kind of misanthrope tone of the concept album is the start of a later characteristic mood among their few later works, but here, the emotion is more displayed with a fierceful anger, but this anger is much more reflected on the start of serious tensions between the bandmates, mainly against the self impossed \\"front man\\" Roger Waters, this is far much of a Roger Waters' album than a Pink Floyd one, and his over controlling, almost megalomaniac control over the album was really starting to piss off David Gilmour and Richard Wright. Richard Wright's position was really underachieving on this album, while not his blame, the album would've been a thousand times better if Roger Waters would had let him contribute on the compositions, and David Gilmour's position in this album is taken as if he were a musician who was only contributing with a Waters' album, but, in a paradox, this one of their most guitar penned albums of all time, but their growing tensions were serious in this release, as Gilmour and Wright were no \\"sheeps\\" for being scared by a dog (Waters).<br /><br />Despite all of this, Roger Waters' compositional brutality and extraordinary talent are fiercefully displayed in the album, and, into the more conceptual/thematic pieces, the best song that stands as a real Pink Floyd's composition is the dramatic \\"Dogs\\", the only composition done by not only Waters but Gilmour, as Gilmour sings the majority of the vocal duties, with Waters on the final verses, although it makes an awkard contrast among the two vocalists, as David Gilmour possesses a much more laid back, low voice, even in the high notes, he barely reaches them, while Waters tends to apply a more screaming voice, he would've reached the higher notes; the metaphoric scent in \\"Dogs\\" is highly explicit Roger Waters himself has admitted that his previous socialistic views, oddly led him to be a \\"dog\\", its content, combined with its serious but more soft music atmosphere, makes it a valuable composition. While the following \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" is much more of a profound composition, while less metaphoric it still possesses a more complex instrumentation, and its meaning against the discret, controlling social leaders, it keeps a bit of confussion among both compositions, as Waters admits. But these songs get completely clear with the following \\"Sheep\\", the most powerful, fierceful and potential song in the album, the more freaky but meaningful style of the song reflects their real power moment, and instead of loosing momentum on later on, it gets refreshing and it even recalls certain parts of \\"Dogs\\" like the repeating, distorted word \\"stone\\", and Dogs characteristic guitar trace, although in this song is much more memorable, the composition keeps its intentions toward the manipulated people which is abused by pigs and dogs, just as a sheep which instead of atacking, afraid runs away from its predator, and here the most meaningful line is \\"Our only hope is that sheeps rebel against the dogs and pigs\\" very metaphoric in the sense that its an almost impossible possibility. All of these politically /socially charged songs are more cooled down by the short, light and even romantic fragments of \\"Pigs On The Wind\\" which are really comforting, the song was written by Waters' wife at that time, Caroline.<br /><br />Animals is not a bad release at all, in fact, its musically one of my deep favourites, and it recalls the more patient but firm style of Meddle, with an unsuccessful vague commercial direction but with a much more profound sensitivity, but the band's tensions, Waters' over controling attitude toward the album's still marvelous songs, and the bandmates' little contributions and discomforting performance, plus the album's socialistic attitude really takes off talent from it, but actually, this still remains as a strong and powerful, eternal release, one of my personal favourite albums ever, but is still a little bit awkward and the situations that it presents are slightly confussing.re more cooled down by the short, light and even romantic fragments of \\"Pigs On The Wind\\" which are really comforting, the song was written by Waters' wife at that time, Caroline.

B000SNUMC0|5.0|I was a bit skeptical of Schaffer's plan to turn three good songs into three good albums. As cool as the something wicked trilogy was, I was afraid that a three part concept album would prove too ambitious, even for Iced Earth.    Once again they have lain our fears to rest with a thoughtful album full of flair & personality. The lyrics and instrumentals are atmospheric and fully appropriate to the subject, while the storyline is explored deeply enough to achieve emotional and ideological variety.    Despite what some were prophesizing when 'Overture of the Wicked' was released, Tim Owens has done a fantastic job belting out Schaffer's well written lyrics.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|END OF AN ERA by Nightwish may very well be the greatest Heavy Metal concert video ever made!  This even tops Manowar's THE ABSOLUTE POWER (sorry Joey!) and Iron Maiden's DANCE OF DEATH.  The band is tight and the performances electric.  But it's the incredibly beautiful Tarja Turunen who makes this concert more than just another video.  This one is a true treasure.  All Metal fans know that Manowar are the Kings of Metal and that Doro (Pesch) is the Queen of Metal.  But, in my humble opinion, Tarja Turunen is the undisputed \\"High Priestess of Metal.\\"  Her voice is just incredible and her performance in this video is so powerful and energetic, enhancing the gothic feel of the band.  It's very sad to note that Nightwish has parted ways with Tarja.  The whole affair with the posting of the letter by the band on the website was, in my opinion, nasty!  Such problems should be kept private, not put on display for the whole world to see.  This is a tragic blow for Heavy Metal music and for Tarja's zillions of fans (why are the fans ALWAYS the biggest losers?).  We finally get a Metal band with class and rare beauty only to have it cruelly taken away.  I can't say what Nightwish will be like with Annette but I hope they can retain some of the magic that Tarja brought to us all.  So, in conclusion, END OF AN ERA is Nightwish at it's best.  But every time I watch it, I feel like Heavy Metal, the greatest form of music in the world, has taken a cold, brutal slap in the face due to the breakup.  To Tarja, I just want to say that I met you at Prog Power a few years ago and had my picture made with you.  It was my wish to personally thank you for the touch of class that you had brought to my music and that's just what I did.  You were quite gracious and appreciative of my words.  I will admire you and love you forever and the photo we took is something I will treasure as long as I live!!  Thank you so much!!  Metal Rules!!!  So does Metal's \\"High Priestess!!\\"
B000MGBSI0|3.0|i recently got both seasons available (1 & 2) and they should have put a little more work on the menu. They almost didn't have any menus, no setup options. I bought it and didn't realize that most of the chapters didn't even have english subtitles. I would have like to have it subtitled in spanish, but at least in english on all chapters! great dvd though. should have been better.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|This attractive box set is great for keeping all of the Sex and the City DVDs together and organized in one place.  Before I got this set, I had all of the individual seasons on seperate dvd's which took up a lot of space and wasn't very convenient for taking to parties or lending out.  The art in this collection is also great, with pictures of all of the actresses and blurbs and quotes from each episode.  This is very helpful when you're looking for that one particular episode that you want to watch!

B000FJ9CGY|4.0|Breakfast of Champions is my first experience with Mr. Vonnegut, whom many of my friends think is one of the best writers ever. I chose Breakfast of Champions because I liked the title - I liked it even more when I learned that it was in reference to martinis. Vonnegut has a unique sense of humor and a style of writing that seems as candid as if he were writing it as a stream of consciousness or sitting in the same room with you telling the story. And it works, it works wondefully and I can't wait to read more of his works. Breakfast of Champions is about two men (a car salesman and a pulp fiction writer) who eventually cross paths in a cocktail lounge. The side characters aren't trivial - they each contribute in some way to each other and to the main characters. Vonnugut illustrates the book with simple and comical drawings that he did himself. While at times I wondered where in the story I was and what he was telling me about at the moment might (or might not) lead to, I stuck with it simply to keep enjoying his style and writing. The book seemed to be laughing at the planet and the people on it, breaking humans down into robots who are programmed to do this and that. Humans, in this novel, did not seem to enjoy the life they were living or take much pride in the world they lived in. The narrator (Vonnegut himself) often compares his characters penis size or the women's body measurements - otherwise nothing personal or individualistic about them. I looked up reviews and notes of the book after I finished reading hoping that they might offer something that I missed or a subplot that I didn't pick up on. I didn't find much, which told me that the book just has to be read to be enjoyed.

B000IMUYJM|4.0|I had heard of this film, but had never watched it, and decided to watch the remake of Black Christmas that came out last year. That re-make is a piece of garbage, and I knew that there was no way this film, that has been deemed a classic horror masterpiece, could be that bad. And I'm happy to say that I was absolutely right! I really don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said about this really good horror film. Yes, this film pre-dates Halloween by about 4 years, and you can tell that are some elements of Halloween that had already been done in this movie. The biggest similarity to me, would be the Point of View camera work, where we see the house through the \\"eyes\\" of Billy as he hides in the attic or in the closet, or wherever. Just watch the first 5 minutes of Halloween, and you'll see that same technique. Anyway, the movie itself has a great story to it. I won't bother explaining it again, other reviewers have already done a much better job of doing that than I could do. But what I will say is that this movie has great suspense and horror elements in it. And it pretty much does it without much actual on-screen blood or violence. The obscene phone calls made by the killer throughout the film are done brilliantly, and really do sound creepy. Also, as one review mentioned, I love the way the movie is left open-ended. Without the audience finding out who exactly Billy is, where he came from, who Agnes was..all that stuff. This was one of the many problems with the crappy remake to this film. It tried to tell the whole backstory of the killer with a series of flashbacks, which was stupid as hell, to say the least. So if you're looking at a good suspenseful horror film, with a good story and decent acting,(John Saxson is great, though the sorority house mother is a bit over-the-top), then I suggest you pick this up. And don't forgot...before Michael Myers or Jason or Freddy ever showed up..there was Billy!!!!

B000GH3CVQ|4.0|A swell mixture of music. For those who thought \\"Once\\" is never enough. Although not very different from the movie soundtrack but number one fans just gotta have this.
B000QXDED6|3.0|\\"300\\" tells the amazing story of how an informal Spartan army of only 300 men held off the massive Persian military force until they were betrayed by an exiled Spartan and decimated by King Xerxes.  The story was incredible, and told very well.  Several of the battle sequences really whet the appetite of the armchair war tactical strategist.  But the flat, fake, chrome-like colors of the film (which make this almost look like a comic book), really take away from the experience.  The slow-motion photography also detracts from the credibility of the film - I can only guess that this technique was used to simulate a 3D effect, which it accomplished to a certain degree, but not enough to make this movie visually appealing.  Also, the \\"look\\" they chose for King Xerxes was awful!  From the research I've done on this individual, I don't believe the costume to be historical - perhaps this was just another of the filmmaker's surreal visuals for shock value?
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Buble is the most consistent vocal artist I know.  His music is<br />ALWAYS good and ALWAYS a joy to listen to.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I bought this CD last week on the insistence of my teenage son, while we were visiting Toronto.  This was definitely a good buy and we've simply been enjoying every single track on this CD.  Truly talented, Michael Buble has artistically show-cased is vocal skills on this fantastic CD. My most favourite tracks are #8 Wonderful Tonight, #9 Everything, #2 It Had Better be tonight, #13 Dream, #3 Me and Mrs. Jones, #5 Comin' Home Baby and #12 That's Life.  This CD will definitely be my choice this year for Christmas gifts to some special friends on my list!  Keep up the good work. . .best wishes from SUNNY BARBADOS.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This is a great album.  Kanye always manages to stay fresh and innovative.  Whether its the beats or the lyrics, he's up to par.  This is by far the best cd I purchased this year.  Some of the beats seem to have an international feel to them, but I guess that's part of Kanye's plan to become one of the best rappers worldwide.  Some of the treats on the cd are Everything I Am, the Glory, Champion, and Can't Tell Me Nothing.  My fav track is the Big Brother track where Kanye goes on to tell how his big brother use to be Big's brother and Dame's brother.  Basically Kanye tells how he moved up within the Roc-a-fella record company and how Jay-Z is his mentor.  Good track...great album.  Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|\\"Supernatural\\" is an amazing television series. No, really, it is. Put aside your skepticism. The network that brought you \\"7th Heaven\\" and \\"Dawson's Creek\\" *can* also make great tv. Because that this show is aired by the CW (formally the WB, still owned by Warner Brothers) is incidental. \\"Supernatural\\" is actually the collaboration of Eric Kripke (the creator/writer), Kim Manners (producer/director, also of \\"The X-Files\\"), Robert Singer (producer/director, also of \\"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\\"), John Shiban (producer/writer, also of \\"The X-Files\\"), Ben Edlund (producer/writer, also of \\"Angel,\\" \\"The Tick\\" and \\"Firefly\\"), and Cyrus Yavneh (producer, also of \\"24\\"). (Did you notice the amount of talent there, and that's all *behind* the camera! There's even more in front of it, not to mention the special effects team, sound editors, makeup effects, and the rest of the crew. This show has it *all*!) The CW just pays for the thing to be made... That's about it... So forgive \\"Supernatural\\" for letting CW foot the bill and give this show a chance. I promise you won't be sorry!     Watch the first two seasons first, in order! Back story is essential for maximum impact! That brings me to the DVDs...    Not only are the episodes themselves reason enough to buy Season Two (and also Season One, but this review is for Season Two), there are *three* commentary tracks on key episodes that are a lot of fun to watch for anyone who might be interested in the show, as well as hardcore fans, hilarious bloopers, and several featurettes. Jared Padalecki's screen test is also included with this set, and I tell you, we get to literally watch him *find* Sam, get to witness the process and I was just blown away. What makes the Season Two set stand out particularly is the Interactive Map feature where you can follow the boys from town to town with each episode and see where that episode was set, as well as anything from a single bit of trivia about that episode to a full half-hour featurette about how the episode was brought to the screen. It's really a neat feature and I'm so glad that they put it in.
B00006AW2S|5.0|This was my favorite album when I was a teenager. We played it 'til there were no more grooves on the vinyl. Somewhere in the vaults, there has to be 1st generation, multi-track session tapes that could be mixed into proper stereo. The reissue of \\"12 X 5\\" has fantastic stereo mixes, so did \\"Now\\".  Why not \\"Out of our Heads\\"??? This album was recorded in the US. All the major studios were using 4 track machines at this point. This great album deserves to be lovingly restored.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|\\"Supernatural\\" is an amazing television series. No, really, it is. Put aside your skepticism. The network that brought you \\"7th Heaven\\" and \\"Dawson's Creek\\" *can* also make great tv. Because that this show is aired by the CW (formally the WB, still owned by Warner Brothers) is incidental. \\"Supernatural\\" is actually the collaboration of Eric Kripke (the creator/writer), Kim Manners (producer/director, also of \\"The X-Files\\"), Robert Singer (producer/director, also of \\"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\\"), John Shiban (producer/writer, also of \\"The X-Files\\"), Ben Edlund (producer/writer, also of \\"Angel,\\" \\"The Tick\\" and \\"Firefly\\"), and Cyrus Yavneh (producer, also of \\"24\\"). (Did you notice the amount of talent there, and that's all *behind* the camera! There's even more in front of it, not to mention the special effects team, sound editors, makeup effects, and the rest of the crew. This show has it *all*!) The CW just pays for the thing to be made... That's about it... So forgive \\"Supernatural\\" for letting CW foot the bill and give this show a chance. I promise you won't be sorry!     Watch the first two seasons first, in order! Back story is essential for maximum impact! That brings me to the DVDs...    Not only are the episodes themselves reason enough to buy Season One (and also Season Two, but this review is for Season One), there are two commentary tracks on key episodes that are a lot of fun to watch for anyone who might be interested in the show, as well as hardcore fans, hilarious bloopers, and two featurettes, unaired scenes and several other fun extras. Totally worth buying for anyone who likes horror movies (or even people who don't because I promise, it's *way* better than your typical horror movie), classic rock, classic cars, Americana, urban legends, myths, folklore, or just really great stories because, at heart, that's what this series is - a really *great* story that I think most people will be able to relate to in some way. This show reallydoes have something for everyone: guys kicking butt and taking names in a very action-movie-hero kind of way, shiny and fun weapons, witty dialogue, awesome acting, cool sets and locations, and ::clears throat:: 90% of the ladies and 10% of the gentlemen out there, did I mention the *really* *hot* guys? \\"Supernatural\\" has got them too... Really, something for everyone... My youngest sister, who is 11, *loves* it and I know older guys well into their 60s who religiously tune in too...

1416524800|4.0|Dan Brown knows how to keep readers on the edges of their seats. Deception Point is a fast-paced, super-smart suspenseful thriller that combines real-world technology with Dan Brown's imaginative flair.<br /><br />Intelligence agent Rachel Sexton, the daughter of an aspiring presidential candidate, is enlisted to take part in a project that will shine much glory on NASA, as the agency will finally be able to prove that alien life exists.<br /><br />Rachel pairs with pretty-boy television star oceanographer Michael Tolland to discover whether NASA's really on to the discovery of the millenium, or if it's all a huge fraud.<br /><br />Brown chose the starkest of settings for this book and his villains are vicious, which makes the heroic efforts of Rachel and Michael that much more pleasing.<br /><br />Deception Point is another thoroughly entertaining excellent example of Brown's skill as a storyteller.
B000RG1FMO|3.0|Kanye is back at it with his third effort. Creative rhymes and dope beats are what kanye has cooked up for the world to listen for his third attempt. Stand out songs like \\"everything I am\\", \\"good life\\", and \\"barry bonds\\" help to make this album a easy favorite in my cd changer. I give this album 3.5 stars due to the fact there are a few weak songs that I skip routinely. Like for instance \\"Drunk and hot girls and I wonder\\" are terrible songs to me. I don't like the energy nor the delivery of the rhymes on these songs. While this isn't a perfect album.....After listening to 50's album, Graduation comes off as a masterpiece.

I am a feminist). Almodovar's story is so been-done-already. Anotonia's Line did it much better and won the 1995 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. It was even less subtle, but at least it was written and directed by a woman.<br /><br />I was really bored by this little soap opera, but kept watching because I was hoping for a twist in the end. I thought that maybe, in the end, the little family might make sense because it would turn out that ridiculously gorgeous Raimunda was actually not related by blood to her mother Irene and sister Soledad, who, played by Carmen Maura and Lola Duenas, actually look believable and very much like mother and daughter but nothing like Penelope Cruz who got so much attention for her portrayal of Raimunda. But no such luck. Evidently, Almodovar just had to have Penelope, with her cleavage and pouty mouth, in his movie, whether she made sense or not.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I did not know much about this independent comedy, until I saw it last weekend. I had heard that it was a surprise favorite at 2004 Sundance festival where it was met with non-stop laughing. Since I admire off-beat humor and am a big fan of a good comedy, I was ready to love or at least like \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\". I was sorely disappointed. The best and the funniest thing about \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" (2004) is its title. By the title alone I expected the movie and its main character to be charismatic and brave as Napoleon I and explosive as dynamite or at least, unpredictable, fresh, and original. Guess what, it is none of the above. First and foremost, the movie is so boring, slow, and non-interesting that I could hardly manage to sit through it. Yes, I've read the comments that Napoleon, and his two equally sleep-walking friends, Pedro, the most impossible candidate for school president and Deb, the girl we should believe Napoleon might have a crush on  and few more high school clich&eacute; characters are exactly like the regular students in a regular high school. Even if it is true and I hope that it is not always the case, I don't have to sympathize with the trio of walking zombies. ND and his friends are so bored and boring that their boredom becomes contagious - for me it was. I did not find anyone on the screen slightly interesting, leave alone sympathetic. Well, there was one exception, Napoleon's and his older brother Kip's, 32 years old Internet chat rooms addict's  grandmother who was injured in a dune buggy accident (that sounded interesting or at least promising) and taken from the screen after the first fifteen minutes. She was lucky - she did not have to endure the presence of her complete idiot-nephew Rico, the ex-jock of the 1982, a door-to-door salesman, whose adventures or projects did not contribute a single funny scene or even a joke to this sophomoric excuse for a movie.<br /><br />While trying not to fall asleep, I was thinking of the others, more successful and much better first movies that might have been the inspiration for ND. Wes Anderson's debut, \\"Bottle Rocket\\" (1996) even if not a masterpiece is often hilarious and always original. Todd Solondz's first feature which explores the similar subject, \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\" (1995) is a terrific film - brave, and passionate - real dynamite.

B000RG1FMO|1.0|What can I say about this album. I will never understand what the hype is about Kanye. I get tired of hearing how great his album is because he sampled some obscure band from the 80s. Lets talk about Kanye's rapping talent. The rhymes on Can't Tell Me Nothing remind me of some white kids \\"rapping\\" in their cafeteria. \\"I feel pressure, under more scrutiny, And I do, What act more stupidly?\\" Under more scrutiny, Kanye should work harder not to make whack rhymes. For an artist that's fan base talks about his humility and internal strife, Kanye does nothing but declare himself God and announce his greatness on the \\"hit\\" Stronger. I hope this is the last of the trilogy. Maybe now that Kanye is graduated his next contribution will be \\"Getting a Real Job.\\"

B000B5XOY8|4.0|There are rumors of a six-foot bat in Gotham City. Whispers. Suggestions. Nothing concrete. But all that changes after the Batman confronts Carl Grissom's men at Axis Chemicals and Grissom's top hood, Jack Napier, gets dropped into a vat of chemicals, transforming him into the maniacal Joker. Discovering he had been set up by his boss to take the fall at Axis, Joker takes over Grissom's operation, in turn allowing him to try and take over Gotham City itself, with only the Dark Knight to stop him.<br /><br />This was the film that gave us the \\"movie Batman\\" we know today: dark and armored. If it wasn't for director Tim Burton's gothic and grim vision of crime-ridden Gotham City and its brooding protector, I suspect the edgy superhero movies of today wouldn't exist.<br /><br />Michael Keaton takes on the title role as billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne and his rubber-clad alter ego Batman, delivering one of the greatest Batman performances that many, at the time, hadn't expected from \\"Mr. Mom.\\" And after his memorable line during the opening rooftop scene, \\"I'm Batman,\\" from that moment on he had you sold that his version of the Dark Knight meant business and quenches any lingering thought that Batman, thanks to the 1960s TV series, is a campy superhero.<br /><br />Stealing the stage is Jack Nicholson as the Joker. Basically take the Jack from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and crank it up to a hundred and you have the Joker. Nicholson does a brilliant job of blending the serious and twisted Joker while also playing the crazy, laughing, psycho killer. I'm sure when Batman: The Animated Series came along, Nicholson's Joker was the template for Mark Hamill's performance when he voiced the character. Awesome.<br /><br />Danny Elfman's haunting and lonely score only adds to the movie's eeriness.<br /><br />My only problem with the film was there wasn't enough Batman. I remember that bothering me as a kid. Batman shows up all of four times in the film, the first being something, like, only for a minute. Each subsequent time gets progressively longer, thankfully.<br /><br />Bold, atmospheric and downright fun, Batman is one for the ages.

B000B5XOSO|3.0|A mysterious \\"penguin man\\" surfaces and takes the city by storm, so much so that evil business tycoon Max Shreck, played by Christopher Walken, thinks he can turn Penguin into the city's new mayor. But Penguin is not all what he seems and he secretly controls the Red Triangle Gang, who are wreaking havoc across the city.<br /><br />Adding to the mix is one Selina Kyle, Shreck's lowly assistant, er, secretary, who, after a bad night with her boss, becomes Catwoman.<br /><br />The Bat Signal shines and the Dark Knight returns to once again rid Gotham of chaos and restore order.<br /><br />Michael Keaton is back as Gotham's Guardian and brings to the role all the mystery and edge that made the '89 movie so popular. What's even better is that this movie actually has Batman in it and the vigilante appears, clad in black armor, more than just four times like in the previous flick.<br /><br />Danny DeVito as the Penguin does a great job given what he had to work with. Though the Penguin in this film is not the same as the one in the comics, DeVito still did well portraying a man who was born . . . a little different.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer pulls off the dual role of Selina Kyle/Catwoman nicely. In fact, she plays four distinct roles in this film, all in one character: nerdy Selina, hip Selina, crazy Selina and Catwoman.<br /><br />This film is filled with action, darkness and fun, all set in Tim Burton's eerie Gotham City, which was a character on its own in this film and its predecessor.<br /><br />It's the hokey plot that's earning this film a lower rating than the previous one. Had the story been better, this movie had the potential to be one of the best superhero flicks ever.
B0002NRQTS|5.0|Some purist Rush fans will say that this album was poorly conceived and that it deviates too much from Rush's early days music. Don't listen to them.     This is one of Rush's most beatiful albums, with some incredible progressive executions. It is known that Geddy, Lifeson and Peart especially like these songs, and they have even stated that during some live performances (while playing Presto during its Rush in Rio tour).   Dated as of the early 90's, this album brings a lot of maturity and innovation at the same time. The result is a mind tricking set of special arrangements that carry at the same time a fantastic \\"mellow\\" factor.    You should listen to Presto when waking up, when driving, when flying and when coming back home drunk. This album will make you a better person.

Upon discovering that they are going to force her to marry her grossly obese and cruel cousin to gain her fortune, Evie escapes and goes to the home of the shameless rake, Sebastian St. Vincent, the same man who tries to kidnap Lillian in the second book to marry her for her fortune.  Sebastian has never given Evie a second look, trying to hold a conversation with her is a nightmare but when she proposes marrying him to escape her relatives he knows he can't refuse, he must marry a fortune.  Evie's proposition is to go to Gretna Green for a hasty marriage and even hastier consummation to make it legal, but from then on out no more intimacy.  All Evie wants is to take care of her father until he dies and to have enough money to live comfortably on...Sebastian should be happy at his good fortune...a wife who is giving him permission to take her money and to pursue any other woman he wants...the problem is he doesn't seem to want any other women anymore. However, can he convince Evie that the best husbands really are reformed rakes.  Evie can't help it, she sees things in Sebastian that he has taken great pains to conceal but she will not allow him to touch her if he can't guarantee monogamy...to test his self control, she makes a deal...if Sebastian can remain celibate for 3 months, she will resume physical relations with him...    This was a passionate, sweet story.  I wish the author would have taken a little bit more time explaining what made Sebastian act the way he does, but still nothing is lost in the story you just want a little more sometimes.
0307236722|4.0|Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook is an extremely well produced cookbook for bakers. There is excellent advice on baking equipment as well as technique. My only complain about the introductory section with this general information is that it is too brief. From there, it's straight into recipes. They are loosely categorized in chapters for Simple Baked Good, Cookies, Cakes, Pies (including tarts, cobblers, and twists), Yeasted Baked Goods, and Pastries. There were some odd omissions including chocolate chip cookies and a classic chocolate cake. I realize that neither is difficult to find elsewhere but I would have expected to see both presented here. All of the recipes are very well written with clear concise language. The finished dishes are shown in photographs of the highest caliber.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that this is more of a cookbook than a true handbook. While there are certainly tips and advice, it is not comprehensive and it is assumed that the reader knows many basic techniques already. Unfortunately for this beginner, that wasn't the case and I had to find another book to help me learn some of the building block skills that every baker must have. I would expect a true handbook to offer more in this regard. Having said that, this is an outstanding cookbook that includes some useful information and advice. I have no problem recommending the book to anyone who understands that this is not a comprehensive \\"how to\\" guide.

B000RG1FMO|4.0|Leave it to Kanye West to somehow come out with the most disappointing album of the year as well as the best rap album of the year. The disappointment was bound to happen considering his first album was not only the best rap album of this decade but holds up to the classics of the old school era. Then followed up that disk with one that pushed the limits of hip-hop, bringing in Jon Brion to co-produce, and came close to being as good as the debut.    The biggest disappointments on Graduation are when tries to follow the template of past jams. Drunk and Hot Girls, featuring Mos Def, have the same tongue in cheek lyrics that made Get `Em High and Golddigger fun, but the ultra slow beat just takes all the fun of this song not to mentioned I lived through many of the events in the song that bring up some bad memories. And one of the highlights of the previous two albums is when Kanye shows his sensitive side like on Family Business and Hey Mama but his man crush for Jay-Z on Big Brother, that closes out the album is a little creepy.    Plus for a guy who never shies away from controversial subjects, like why he suggested it was Reagan who introduced crack into the ghetto and of course his George Bush comment, it is a little disappointing he doesn't take a stance on Big Head Barry on Barry Bonds (skip the forgettable Lil' Wayne verse) even though he mentions, \\"My head's so big you can't sit behind me\\" yet no mentions of Barry's oversized dome. That's not to say Mr. West avoids all controversial statement saying in album opener Good Morning, \\"I'm like a fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary.\\"    And yes, the album actually starts off with a song, not Bernie Mac who opened the previous two albums. In fact Kanye eliminated one of the biggest rap clichés with no skits on the whole album. And in a time when all the other rappers that get radio play are still trying to recreate a mix of Dre, Biggie and Pac or creating beats so simplistic so they make good ringtones even if the song as a whole suffers, continues to push music further.    Kanye has no problems with paying the sample rates just to get a snippet of Elton John's Someone Saved My Life Tonight that even someone with the best musical ear wouldn't recognize on Good Morning. Or making Chuck D's \\"Here We Go Again,\\" scratched up by DJ Premier, part of the slow jam Everything I Am. Really, can you imagine Can't Tell Me Nothing being as good without the \\"yeah's eh's and ha-ha's from the Young Jeezy song? It is this attention to detail that has been lacking in hip-hop since they started enforcing sample payments.    But skits are replaced by newer rap cliché with T-Pain, who shows up on every song that doesn't already have Akon on it. Thankfully the annoying voice box enhanced singer is only relegated to repeating the line from School Spirit during the club ready Good Life. Unfortunately a guest spot from the dude from Coldplay doesn't work at all and just sounds out of place singing about \\"fireworks on Lake Michigan\\" on Homecoming.    If you are looking for some old school Kanye, The Glory would have fit well in the first album with its sped up soul sample playing thought the song and quirky lines like, \\"Two years the Dwayne Wayne became the Dwayne Wade. I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley.\\" But on the rest of Graduation tries to push things further. All summer long it seemed like every other week a new Kanye West track leaked to the internet but that may have been a good game plan because songs like Stronger and Can't Tell Me Nothing take a while for them to get burned into your conscience. Hopefully some of the disappointing tracks will start to grow on me in time too.
0446613444|4.0|This is the second novel of the Harry Bosch series and I enjoyed this book more than Black Echo, the first novel of the series. In Black Ice, there is a new drug on the streets and the plot unfolds giving the reader an insight into the vicious drug dealing world that generates crooked cops, with lots of twists and turns. There are numerous subplots in the story, and about the midway point I was a bit confused, but the author ensured that I didn't stay lost and it all worked out in the end. If you enjoy a great mystery, coupled with a thrilling tale then check this book out or any of the books in the series.

B00007JVBI|5.0|Chan Marshall, better known by her stage name of Cat Power is one of the most  thrilling talents to have come out of the indie rock scene in recent years. This is the album that really marks her fruition as an artist. I has the mainstream romps of \\"He War\\" and \\"Free\\" coupled with the evocative lo-fi \\"Fool\\" and \\"Werewolf\\".<br /><br />After years in the wilderness of the indie underground, \\"You Are Free\\" seems like the perfect album to introduce the public to Chan. It maintains her lo-fi and blues roots but does so without the obnoxious pretension of fellow artists like Smog and Bonnie Prince Billy.  The mixture of elements to the sound of the album is varied, providing minimalism (lo-fi) alongside the heart-wrenching beauty of the string driven \\"Good Woman\\".<br /><br />The songwriting is simple, there are no  extensive riffs, no James Joyce style lyrics and the simplicity is just sublime. While it doesn't have the cohesion of her latest album \\"The Greatest\\" in many ways it is her masterpiece as it sounds effortless and haunting. Unlike the cover photo, much of this albums minimalist moments give it a claustrophobic feel that she only briefly breaks out of. Chan sings with such passion, not the overbearing power-ballad stylings of Bon Jovi or the hectic scatting of jazz, but simple raw emotion.<br /><br />\\"You Are Free\\" is still very much an indie record that you would expect from the masters of indie rock labels Matador but it has the raw intensity that lacks from much of it's overall output. A quintissential record whose merits are frequently undermined by the comparisons to \\"Moon Pix\\". This album is in a completely different league.

0805080120|5.0|I've read a goodly amount of material on linguistics, so I expect each new book to go over much the same ground as previous books, but this one took me by surprise -- it's chock full of new and interesting ideas. Other reviewers have already explained the basic structure of the book; allow me to offer some of the tidbits that stuck to my mind:<br /><br />1. The concept of erosion. People always shorten words, cut off consonants, simplify vowels. His working example, and an excellent one it is, is \\"gonna\\", an eroded form of \\"going to\\". Erosion wears down words to the point that they start to lose expressiveness, at which point people tack on something else to clarify their meaning. He presents one case of a French word; I can't recall the details but here's an analogy: suppose that \\"gonna\\" someday gets eroded to 'gon' and later to 'g'. At some point, people will need to flesh it out, so perhaps they'll tack 'will' onto it to get 'gwill', which in turn might get eroded down to 'gill'. And so on and on and on. Many of the words in our language are eroded, compressed, multi-layer fossils of much longer original expressions.<br /><br />2. Complementing erosion is back-formation, a process by which people extend patterns in the language to other words. One example might be the child who says, \\"I goed with mommy.\\" The trick is, there are lots of patterns scattered all through the language, and ofttimes a pattern can be recruited to a word when that word has been dangerously eroded. This is especially likely when two words are similar in pronunciation. \\"sing sang sung\\" leads to \\"ring rang rung\\" -- but should past tense of the fairly new verb \\"wing\\" be \\"winged\\" or \\"wang\\" or \\"wung\\"? With so many patterns to choose from, there's always grist for language change.<br /><br />3. He starts off with a delightful point on the common plaint that English is going to hell, that people nowadays don't know how to use it properly, how just 30 years ago the language was so much more pristine. He presents a modern quote to this effect; then another quote from 30 years ago saying the same thing; then another quote from 30 years before that saying the same thing; and so on all the way back to 1620. The more things change, the more they stay the same.<br /><br />4. I was particularly impressed by his explanation of how the weird Semitic word system (every word has a root of three consonants, and the vowels that are filled in specify its gender, case, number, and so forth.) He starts by pointing out that this system is too intricate, too well-ordered, to have simply arisen by chance. Or is it? He proceeds to demonstrate just how it could have happened using erosion and back-formation.<br /><br />5. Vowel coloring. This is another concept that I had seen mentioned but never explained. Some vowels can affect vowels near them in a word. The example he gives is the Germanic \\"gest\\", whose plural was \\"gestiz\\". [I'm probably screwing up the spelling here.] The 'i' in the plural form \\"colored\\" the 'e' and caused it to shift into an 'a'. Later on, the 'iz' was eroded down to a schwa (spelled as an 'e', but pronounced as a short \\"uh\\"). Thus, the singular is \\"Gest\\" but the plural is \\"Gaste\\".<br /><br />All in all, a surprising and fascinating book. This guy is definitely on my list of authors to watch.quote to this effect; then another quote from 30 years ago saying the same thing; then another quote from 30 years before that saying the same thing; and so on all the way back to 1620.

B000RG1FMO|4.0|I'm a big fan of Takashi Murakami, and the poster and cover art are definitely worth the $10.    As for the CD..  Well, it rolls along pretty well, but like most pop-hip hop thats out now, the subject matter is really lackluster.  Kanye has never been thrown in the same ring as other progressive hip-hop MCs so that shouldn't be a surprise, but it is weird to hear 'Ye and Mos Def together on a track about drunk chicks doing drunk chick stuff.      Out of all the pre-release singles and cuts that made the album I was a little sad to see that \\"Bittersweet\\" with John Mayer DIDN'T make the album.  I'm guessing that Lil Wayne (on \\"Barry Bonds\\") was seen as someone that would sell more records, but truth be told, \\"Bittersweet\\" is a better record with more crossover and radio play potential.  Another track that didn't make it was the OTHER Mos Def track, \\"Goodnight\\" (which supposedly made the Japan/UK versions of the album), which is a better tune in my opinion than \\"Drunk and hot girls.\\"    \\"Flashing Lights\\" is a nice, soul sammich and \\"Champion\\" has party play written all over it, but in 10 plays, I'm not exactly calling the rest of this album a classic.  Speaking of classics, if you haven't heard that Common album \\"Finding Forever\\"....
B00006I53S|3.0|I bought this lens to serve as one lens fits all needs. It definitely served the purpose. However, this lens has inherent flaws - poor motor that makes the lens not to focus quickly, lack of sharpness in the image and the sound during focus etc. I was suffering to get a good sharp picture with this one.  I will definitely discourage getting this lens as there are better ones out there - even from Canon. Although I read several discouraging reviews before I bought this, price was the attractive feature at that point.    Sadly, at the end, my digital SLR camera with this lens was stolen by Chennai Airport baggage handlers in India during my last trip.     I am planning to get a new camera and a lens - definitely not this lens.

0757302661|3.0|This book was somewhat useful and had some good tools and the cd was useful. However, it is quite upsetting when it starts to get into a subject, exercise, etc. and merely states \\"you will learn more of this in your class\\".  Apparently you are supposed to use this book while taking a class.  If only the authors and publishers let you know that before you order it.

0671015206|5.0|I mostly read non-fiction these days. Usually I stick to travelogues and historical accounts that generally are about the North Atlantic and, well, History. This year I made a point of starting to read business books.    \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" isn't a book on business. It provides outstanding insight into how one should manage his or her personal finances through frugal spending. The authors aren't talking about investing in stocks. That is not the intention of the book. The key here is the word frugal. We live in a \\"high consumption\\" society and the temptation to spend on unnecessary items is way too high.    Using ample evidence (real life cases and consulting with millionaires), the authors drive home the point that a high income earner will not necessarily become a millionaire...and that guy driving the gleaming new Ferrari may not have enough to retire comfortably. Some of what the authors say may seem repetitive but their message works. They talk about everything from spoiled rich kids who have never managed to escape the influence of their parents to the tactics employed by those wealthy people when shopping for used cars.    My own spending habits (since I've finished reading the book) 3 months ago have changed considerably...for the better, I am sure. Because of its easy to understand format (the authors use plain English and no math), this book would make an interesting enough read for teenagers about to finish high school.
B000UUF69A|4.0|I used to read the comic book \\"back in the day,\\" watched the animated TV show and even the movies.  Yes, the horrible live-action movies.  My expectations were low when this movie came out so I didn't see it in a theater.  After renting it from Amazon, I now regret that I missed seeing it on the big screen.    The animation is top notch and the voice acting is decent.  What surprised me the most was the story.  Unlike the live-action films, it wasn't loaded up with lame surfer jokes and slapstick.  The story stayed true to the comic and captured the essence of what makes TMNT fun.      I highly recommend seeing this film.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|A few tracks short of being a classic. The album is better without the skits though a few more tracks would have being nice. But all-in-all a pretty solid album.
B000002GYR|3.0|the reason i rated this album so harshley is because this is in my opinion toms weakest effort.

B000T05R8Q|5.0|Piper At The Gates Of Dawn is one of my favorite albums, and personally I've always found it to be Pink Floyd's best album(and if any discography is jammed with classic albums it's the mighty Floyd's). Every song featured is a psychedelic gem/masterpiece that pushed the envelope of what was possible at the time. Syd Barrett knew how to write song's that were experimental, but also extremely interesting and to be truthful accessible.    That's just a brief review of the album, believe me I could go on for hours on Piper, its just that great. However the purpose of this review is to go over the particulars of the 40th anniversary edition. Overall it's fantastic. There are two major incentives for true fans that already own  the album, and don't want to buy it just for the new packaging. First off the mono mix of Piper(disc one of this set) completely blows the stereo mix out of the water. After listening to the mono mix I can confidently say I will not be listening to the stereo mix all to often. The mono mix was supposedly mixed by Barrett himself, and offers a slightly more psychedelic mix than the stereo mix most are accustomed too. Effects that cant be heard in the stereo mix jump out. The vocals have a much more cosmic sound to them, and the instruments just leap out of the mix in a kaleidoscopic swirl of sound. However there are some interesting qualities in the stereo mix(Disc 2), that make it worthwhile as well. While the mix doesn't leap out like the mono does, the stereo mix offers interest for those with headphones, as instruments move in and out of the left and right channels creating interesting panning effects. Overall I prefer the mono mix but the stereo mix deserves a listen now and then, to decipher its own different sonic textures.    The other big incentive for long time fans is disc three, which includes the early singles which are \\"Arnold Layne\\", \\"Candy And A Currant Bun\\", \\"See Emily Play\\", \\"Apples And Oranges\\", and \\"Paintbox\\". Also included are 2takes of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\"(that are substantially different from the version on the album), \\"Matilda Mother\\"(with new lyrics), and a stereo mix of \\"Apples And Oranges\\". This disc is not your average rag tag collection of bonus tracks the early singles are all top tier Floyd songs, and are finally available by means other than buying a greatest hits collection(\\"See Emily Play\\", \\"Arnold Layne\\", \\"Paintbox\\") or hunting down the now hard to find early singles promo, or the currently out of print and incredidbly expensive Shine On box set(\\"Apples And Oranges\\", \\"Candy And A Currant Bun\\"). \\"Apples and Oranges\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\" especially rank up there in my top ten favorite Floyd songs. The two alternate versions of Interstellar Overdrive are also rather interesting, and the take of \\"Matilda Mother\\" is fun to listen to with its new lyrics.    The packaging itself is also great including a twelve page reproduction of one of Syd's actual notebooks.    So overall is this the best way to buy Piper? Well if you already own it and you truly enjoy it than this is well worth it. However if you've never even heard Piper before it might be a good idea to just go ahead and get the regular edition, unless of course you want the singles, as this really the best way to get them. So if you are a true fan of Floyd than consider getting this, I can say this is the best music purchase i've made in a long time and i'd heard Piper at least a thousand times before buying this.
B000002GWJ|4.0|hey waits fans this is a great album with some of waits best songs like romeo is bleeding. but it also has uneven songs like somewhere. so though i recommend this album i wouldn't start here

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I reccommend for all to buy Firefly the Series and Serenity Collector's Edition to all those who haven't purchased either one. [[ASIN:B000Q9IZ5C Serenity (Collector's Edition)]]    I must admit that when Firefly first came on Fox I watched the first 15 minutes and gave up on the series right then. I thought it was going to be some melodrama crap like another crap sci fi show called \\"Space Above & Beyond.\\" Even when the movie Serenity came out I still had the opinion that this was a terrible series. I was wrong.     I had my appendix removed not long ago and had to spend some time in bed. It was then the Sci Fi Channel ran reruns of Firefly and I became hooked. I am truly kicking myself for my initial opinion of the show but better late than never. I wish I had seen the movie Serenity in the theater, but I ended up buying it too.    I'm not going to go into the storyline or why I liked the series and the movie. I just reccommend that those of you slightly interested to buy Firefly the Series and Serenity the Collector's Edition. You'll love it.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|Loved it! Action packed and full of suspense. Great chases and drama! A must see!
B000Q9IZ5C|3.0|I already had Serenity on DVD before this Collector's Edition came out. I thought it was going to have added scenes to the original movie but sad to say I was wrong. If you already own the first Serenity DVD then don't bother with the Collector's Edtion. It does not have added scenes in the movie and the special features and interviews aren't enough to make up for the disappointment.  If you don't own Serenity then buy this Collector's Edition. It's only a few bucks more and the special features are worth an extra 3 or 4 dollars.   I hope that Joss Whedon comes out with a \\"real\\" collector's edition very soon that includes added scenes into the movie itself.   I give this Collector's Edition 5 Stars for those who don't already own Serenity and 1 Star for those that do own the first Serenity DVD. Thus the average is 3 Stars
B00003CWNR|4.0|This movie probably won't change your mind about your particular beliefs but it likely will give you pause to consider your conscience with respect to such things as loyalty, drug abuse, abortion, commitment, and even difficult topics to address such as finding redemption at death, and quite a series of morally imprecise character interactions. If you're looking for the mean terrible Bad Guy to get put in his place by the helpless innocent Good Guy, you won't want to watch this movie. If you want a movie to inspire you to examine our at-best imperfect world, and your understanding of your place in it, give this a view.
B000ILYYJE|5.0|If you grew up listening to the Doors , Jimi Hendrix, Cream and so many other great 60's bands in MOno, this is a nice treat. Nice videos and bonus tracks makes this a must have. So many takes on Roadhouse Blues that it makes you wonder how they picked one.

B0006FO8RA|5.0|I've been a britney fan since I was 12 years old.  And you know what? a majority of these reviews are from haters, people who dont like britney from her mistakes in the past or just hate her, which I don't think is really fair.  Now i am not saying everything britney did is right, I know she is a little nutty, but come on, stfu with all this negativness.  This is a great cd for fans and past fans.  Britney can sing, or she used to be able to whatever.  Anyway, I don't like britney anymore, as a fan. But I still have this cd, and I listen to it all the time. it has all her catchy songs like toxic, my prerogative and more.  Def. buy this is your a fan, or were.   Again, if your thinking of buying this cause your a britney fan or were, DO IT. just do it! all these negative reviews are from freakish people who just hate britney. Alot of these negative reviews are pathetic people trying to be funny and sarcastic.  I feel so bad for britney, a few mistakes and you get people flocking reviews posting negative stuff.

B000VWYJ86|2.0|Oh how *subtle.* While rogue CIA director Ezra Kramer is plotting to murder Americans and use Pamela Landy as the fall gal, the director sticks an American flag on Kramer's desk.  That's subtlety in American cinema right there pal.  And if visual depiction of contempt for American patriotism isn't enough, how about the stock \\"the-rogue-CIA-is-out-to-kill-you\\" plot?  If you want better movies using that now-overworked anti-American plot, look no further than the much better done \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" or even \\"Clear and Present Danger.\\"<br /><br />Kyle Smith, film critic for the New York Post, takes a similar, but more left-right theme in his review (humorously titled \\"When Liberals Attack\\"):<br /><br />\\"Bourne himself resolves the great contradiction bedeviling the liberal action movie --namely, how do you make your hero a killing machine .  .  .  without making him politically incorrect and illiberal along the way?  The ingenious solution is to make Bourne an unwilling killing machine, a man whose body is a weapon that his amnesia-ridden mind doesn't understand, or even quite control... Scenes of a captive Bourne being hooded and waterboarded in intentionally dehumanizing training sessions also tickle one of the left's most accessible pleasure centers, the one marked Gitmo guilt.\\"<br /><br />LOL.  I wish I could write prose as good as Mr. Smith's.<br /><br />Besides the problem mentioned above, I must also reiterate the same problem I had with \\"Bourne Identity\\": the premise of the books was Jason Bourne as a good guy who lost his memory, not an amoral assassin who lost his memory after being subjected to brainwashing like something straight out of \\"Blood Diamond.\\"<br /><br />Look, I appreciate Julia Stiles coming back.  That was good.  A little coincidental, but good.  However, that, and great star power, and lots of explosions, and good chase scenes, and exotic locales, just don't make up for this movie that at its heart doesn't like, want or care about your country.*<br /><br />*  Of course, if you're not American, you'll probably love this film, since it both confirms and panders to your fears, stereotypes and prejudices about the U.S. Perhaps the film's political bias is simple recognition that overseas revenues constitute an important part of its total gross.American, you'll probably love this film, since it both confirms and panders to your fears, stereotypes and prejudices about the U.S. Perhaps the film's political bias is simple recognition that overseas revenues constitute an important part of its total gross.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|This album has been in the works for literally years and it's been worth every second of the wait.  It's hard to convey how awesome this album is through words for it needs to be heard to be believed. I will try though, at any rate, to explain what I feel is without a doubt the album of the year (it did go to Character by Dark Tranquillity but it's now number 2 :P )      A lot of people will not give this album a chance because Barlow is gone and that, as good of a release as it was, the glorious burden lost a lot of the \\"iced earth\\" feel.  Sure, Barlow IS still their best singer but the band existed before him and, obviously, after him.  Jon IS Iced Earth and always will be.  No matter who the singer is, it's him that we should be focused on.  Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens may not convey emotion as well as Barlow but his vocals are loud, clear, crisp, and rip through you. Quite simply, the man sings his ass off on this album.  If TGB didn't, then this album will prove that Ripper was the ONLY choice for Iced Earth after Barlow's departure.      Remember the galloping guitar riffs?  The power metal mixed with thrash metal sound?  These things were pretty much gone from TGB but they are back in full force this time around.  Schaffer really must be commended for this release.  He continues to prove is one of the world's greatest song writers and that he is also one of the best guitar players.  He plays  (well, pretty much) all the guitar parts on the album and out does himself somehow.  It doesn't matter if he's playing a choppy, chugging riff, or a melodic lead; he does well on all the parts and shines through and through.    Now, onto the songs.  There are 19 tracks on this and that may seem like it would be too cluttered of a listen and just drag on and on but nothing could be further from the truth.  I will break down the songs for you.    Of the 19 songs, 8 of them are not actual songs, at least not in the conventional sense.  Track 1 is an intro, and it's one of the best intro tracks I've ever heard, it's beautiful actually.  Tracks 3 and 4 are short interludes that blend amazingly into track 5, Setian Massacre.  Tracks 7, 9, 11, and 15 are the other interludes and play their parts well by blending the story parts together with the actual songs.  Lastly, track 19 is an outro.      Listening to the album as a whole, from start to finish then the intro, outro, and the interludes are nice little additions.  Of course, none of them are strong enough to want to listen to them by themselves too much but that is not their point.  Now, onto the rest. There are 10 tracks of actual full length songs.  These are tracks 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18.  I don't want to give away too much of the songs since this album NEEDS to be discovered through listening rather than word of mouth but I will give some personal highlights.  Track 2, Something Wicked Pt. 1, nails the classic Iced Earth sound from the very first second: heavy yet melodic with lots of emotion.  Track 5, Setian Massacre, has a great chorus and very cool solos.  The chunky and very heavy riffs go great with Ripper's soring vocals and keyboards on track 6, A Charge to Keep.  This song has a very strong atmosphere.  Track 8, Ten Thousand Strong, rips you open with a 13 second long scream from Ripper and fast guitar parts and yet another great chorus.  The Clouding is one of the best tracks Jon has every wrote.  For the first 4 or 5 minutes, it's a light hearted \\"ballad\\" type song then suddenly gets heavy with a great riff and a scream from the scream machine himself.  The whole song is just great.  The light and heavy parts just go together so well.  For a really great iron maiden worshiping galloping riff, just listen to the title track, number 17.      If you are new to Iced Earth, I do not suggest this album as a starting point. This album is clearly made for the long time fans who have grown to love this amazing band.  If you've been with the band for a long time or have a decent view of the band, then there really is no reason why anyone shouldn't pick this up.    UP THE IRONS!!!!    PS: Both the cover and inside art of the booklet is AMAZING.  The artists have really amazing talent. Nathan Perry and Felipe Machado Franco did the cover art.  Both of them plus David Newman-Stump did the interior booklet artwork.

B000RG1FMO|4.0|O.K. people, let's get one thing clear...Kanye & 50 release two different types of music. Stop comparing the two. A good analogy to make would be to compare Kanye West's album to a good drama you pay to see at the movies, but would NEVER buy once it comes out on disc. It's good, but not something you and your friends would sit around the living room watching. On the other hand, 50's album is like a summer blockbuster that is so amazing (i.e.: action sequences or stunning visuals) that you'll watch it more than once at the movies and then BUY the DVD once it's released. You can watch a mindless action flick like Kill Bill or Matrix with some buddies without feeling weird. So yes, Kanye's music may be deeper and 50's may be more surface layered, but the CURTIS album is a better value for your money. And to those that side with Kanye on a moral standpoint, consider this: Kanye says the N-word quite frequently, uses all the curse words known to man, raps about taking advantage of intoxicated women, and gloats about money as well. These two are only giving the public what they WANT to see. You want 50 Cent to be a thug, so he accomodated you. If anyone thinks 50 Cent isn't lyrical go \\"obtain\\" his unreleased album POWER OF THE DOLLAR. It is a hip-hop purist album on par with ILLMATIC, REASONABLE DOUBT & READY TO DIE. However, lyrics like those don't sell today. Lloyd Banks once said, \\"Go 'head 'cuz switch your style up/ And if they hate, let 'em hate/ And watch the money pile up/\\". Trust me, I am not rolling through my hood in Brooklyn bumping Kanye's music. That is an automatic carjacking. The dudes in my hood will look at me the way zombies do when they find out a warm flesh and blood human is in their midst. They stare with annoyed shock and then give chase.
0345457692|3.0|Seemed like it would be a hit, but too much technical jargon.  Book should have ended 50 pages earlier then it did.  I found myself wondering if the author got more money if he reached 500 pages.  The idea of the book is interesting but not fulfilling.  Fight scenes are good, but theres not enough of them.  Interesting technology. I would not read the follow up to this
B000SNUMC0|5.0|This is simply a great album from start to finish.  The song 10,000 Strong is so good I get chills every time I listen to it.  I've always liked Tim Owens, and thought he did a really respectable job filling in for Rob Halford of Judas Priest.  However, there is only one Rob Halford, although Owens did manage to record some great stuff with Priest.    That being said, Tim Owens has definitely found his niche in Iced Earth, and in my opinion is to that band what Bruce Dickinson is to Iron Maiden.  He fits their style perfectly, and I think is actually one of the best vocalists in metal.  The band has never sounded better, and it is so cool hearing the accompanying lyrics sung to perfection.  I honestly can't remember the last time I was as excited about any CD as Framing Armageddon.  Most bands seem to wane over time.  Iced Earth is one that definitely keeps getting better.    If you're just discovering Iced Earth, you might want to pick up their compilation CD, but do yourself a favor and definitely add Something Wicked This Way Comes and their live album Alive in Athens to your collection.  You won't be sorry you did.  These are widely regarded as their very best, and I would even say are two of the best metal CDs of all time.  When I first discovered Iced Earth, it was all I played for six months without ever getting sick of it.  If you do get Alive in Athens, though, make sure you buy the 3-disc CD rather than the 2-disc one.
0553260111|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing!  I can't get over the amount of detail that Robert Ludlum put into the plot of this book.   It's a non-stop action packed story with a bit of mystery tied in.  I could not put it down.   I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie and I am glad I did, as I hear that they are very different from one another.  The characters in the story are very believable and you can't help but want Jason and Marie to succeed.     The story is about a man \\"Jason Bourne\\" who wakes up and can't remember who he is.  However his body is covered in scars and bullet wounds and a piece of microfilm with a Swiss bank account number was surgically removed from his hip.  While Jason is trying to get to the bottom of who he is, he finds that he has been targeted by \\"Carlos\\" the world's most lethal assassin.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|This is a solid release.  Definitely not his best album, but it's solid.  I'll be honest, I did expect a little bit more from Kanye.  Overall I was a little let down from Kanye's \\"Graduation\\", but even more so from 50's \\"Curtis\\".  I thought both of these albums were going to be fire.
0978607651|4.0|Fans of Charley Harper will be thrilled by the breadth of this book, which produces images from his early illustration work as well as dozens and dozens of his beloved art prints. Todd Oldham did an outstanding job choosing and laying out the art work, which truly give a great overview of Charley's life and work.    HOWEVER. The book is printed on thick paper with a matte finish, and the result is disappointing for anyone who has seen the real pieces. The colors are muddy and dull, not at all like the bright colors Charley used, and the images lack the crisp lines that are the hallmark of serigraph prints. Glossy paper helps keep the colors bright and the lines sharp. This book has a hefty weight and a luxurious feel, but the images suffer substantially.    I hope that Todd Oldham and the printers will consider a second printing on glossy paper. Buy this book if you want to spend $200-$400 for a comprehensive look at Charley Harper's amazing work. But if you really want to enjoy his style, spend $50 for the smaller selection in \\"Beguiled by the Wild.\\"
0060763892|5.0|I've loved every one of James Rollin's books and this one is no exception. He presents a grand adventure that kept me turning pages. When I pick up one of his books, I know what I'm getting, otherwise I never would pay the money. He has all the elements I like in a good story with great characters, lots of tension, and plenty of history and science thrown in. Plus, I love the puzzles, and especially the illustrations.<br /><br />Great work and I can't wait for the next Sigma novel. Highly recommended.
0765315246|5.0|The book is well written, with only a few typos.  It keeps your interest from the begining and leaves you wanting more.  Scalzi devlops his futuristic world well, and makes you care about the characters.  Read this one and be ready to delve into the rest of the series.  A sci-fi must.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|but a thinning of wallet will be in store for you. Does anyone know the episode order? Is it by original airdate or production order? And will we get The Cage on this set or will we have to wait until Season 3 comes out like last time? I'm hoping it starts out with The Cage and continues by production order, not airdate.
0385333846|5.0|So fluid is Vonnegut's style that you feel yourself on a voyage whose importance and profound nature you can't stop to contemplate until it's all over and you're left breathless.  \\"So it goes\\".    This is - by far - my favourite Vonnegut story and that speaks to how beautiful this story is.  A poignant masterpiece.  Read it.  Enjoy it on all levels.
B000002KOQ|5.0|This is absolutely one of the most beautiful albums recorded. Joni's work stands up as much today as it did in 1970 when I first heard this album. It contains not only 3 of her more popular songs, (Big Yellow Taxi, Woodstock and The Circle Game) but also contains many that were never hits but are incredible none-the-less, (For Free, The Priest, Lady's of the Canyon, to name a few). I bought this CD to replace my vinyl recording and it felt like I was hearing it all again for the first time. Beautiful...
0316113077|5.0|I own many cake/cookie books of fine quality and this one is no exception.  While the sugar cookie recipe had a paper correction tucked inside the front cover, using the correction the outcome was wonderful!  My family gobbled them down within 24 hours (and it was a double batch) and has been begging for more.  The decorating ideas are also wonderful, focusing on more small items like cupcakes and cookies.
B00000I8NC|5.0|\\"Slow Riot\\" showcases what GYBE! are capable of - expansive post rock that rises to the heavens in crescendos of thick instrumentation. Many imitate the same ambitious and monumental style, but few, if any, come close.<br /><br />The band has a collection of consistently wonderful releases, including their most acclaimed and defining moment \\"Lift Your Skinny Fists\\". \\"Slow Riot\\" displays the same approach found throughout their works - the tendency for sampling, quiet and brooding sections building up and shifting into intensely layered climaxes. This is the case with \\"Moya\\", which moves through variations and ideas until the main melody is given a sharp tempo change, uplifting the song and forging one of the finest moments in the GYBE! catalogue. \\"BBF3\\" takes a long time to get going, opening with lots of sampling addressing political and social states, a theme the band often depicts, until the pace and layering is increased, culminating in severe blasts of guitars and strings.<br /><br />The two songs rank among the band's best, and while \\"Slow Riot\\" is only an EP and half the monster of \\"Lift Your Skinny Fists\\", it is still a fine outing. Highly recommended for fans of the band and the genre, and a god place to start for newcomers.
0553108034|4.0|This book was in excellent shape and a joy to read...i appreciate the quickness with which it was shipped
B000RG1FMO|2.0|this album is by far kanyes worst. yes, the beats are amazing as usually but kanyes flow and lyrics are absolute garbage. stronger is a good song but is ruined by the fact that he is rapping about klondikes. there are very few good songs on this album and none of them are even close to being college dropout material. once again, i cannot emphasize enough how bad the lyrics are. kanye should stick to producing.

B00026WU82|5.0|THIS IS BOB'S NUMBER 1 CLASSIC ALBUM OF ALL TIMES! This is THE 1960's Bob Dylan classic that EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE for a decent collection of Bob Dylan's earlier songs--AND THE PRICE IS PHENOMENAL!!! This is the ultimate favorite among most Dylan fans, and it ranks the same for me.  Please don't skip this one if you are starting out.  Even Bob Dylan said back then he would never make another album like this one.<br /><br />Some suggestions:(You might want to add the book the \\"Legendary Sessions: Highway 61 Revisited\\".) I highly suggest \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" which he recorded just before this one that includes his masterpiece \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\", and is just ABOUT as good as \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", \\"Blonde On Blonde\\" and the two BOOTLEG series (1-3 and 7) to make a good beginner's collection along with \\"The Essential Bob Dylan\\" 2 CD set.  You can get all his early albums which is NEVER a mistake (1962-1964), but \\"The Essential Bob Dylan\\" is a VERY GOOD START.  Bob WROTE SO MANY LYRICS and cut so many records that it's dazzling!!!  He wrote \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" in just MINUTES and \\"When the Ship Comes In\\" in one evening!!!  If you are a newcomer, you might want to eventually get ALL his classics from the beginning UP until 1969 and then SKIP some to get \\"Blood on the Tracks\\".  THEN if you want MORE, I HIGHLY suggest \\"TIME OUT OF MIND\\"--AN AWARD WINNING EPOCH ALBUM, \\"Desire\\" for at least \\"Isis\\", \\"Hurricane\\" and \\"Sara\\", \\"Oh Mercy\\" is a super MUST BUY and \\"Slow Train Coming\\" is REALLY super which were done later--see my reviews!!!  \\"Slow Train Coming\\" is his version of Christian Gospel--DYLAN STYLE, but don't miss this one even if you don't agree with his evangelizing or if you are not Christian (he is culturally Jewish).<br /><br />TRUST ME ON THESE SUGGESTIONS because I edited this review after I went thru many more of his albums!!
B000007R1M|5.0|A great album. It's so good that you'll find that it ends too soon. Kraftwerk at it's best (along with Trans Europe Express). Don't hesitate to buy it. It won't dissapoint.

B000SO7OM0|5.0|I will keep this short and simple. The sonics are outstanding, The setting is awesome with one of the best DVDs  ever filmed. The sound quality and the majestic songs that Loreena has chosen will delight any fan of hers as  well as anyone who enjoys great music coupled with an amazing visual DVD. 5 Stars is not enough for this one.  This is my first DVD that merits a 6. Pure magic!
B000RG1FMO|5.0|It's almost expected a Kanye West album to have excellent production and beats, partly due to his adventurous collaborations with musicians as disparate as Jon Brion, Chris Martin, and even the pop band Peter Bjorn and John. But what really resonates with this album is Kanye's writing, his incredible wordplay and self-reflection. That's why I never like to hear people dismiss Kanye's work and talent by indicting his public personality; to listen to Graduation, or any of his albums, is to understand that the real Kanye West is a lot more human than some people might like to think. This album largely concerns itself with his skyrocketing fame, and while tracks like \\"Barry Bonds\\" and \\"Drunk and Hot Girls\\" falter, the rest of the album is a sonically expansive, compelling exploration of the tension between Kanye's public persona and his inner-existence.     With Jay-Z releasing what might well be his final album last year, Graduation feels like an important album, a rarity in a year that seems to be defined by band's releasing albums that, while solid and in some cases more than solid, lacked the definitiveness a truly great album has. Here, West pushes himself, and the results are unforgettable. But it's not just the go-for-broke energy and inspired production that make this a great album; its Kanye's appreciation not only of his own talent (he's got enough of that) but of his forebears in hip-hop, the pioneers and gangstas who defined the genre and whose influence can be found not only in this album, but in all hip-hop. The last song (and, for my money, the best song), \\"Big Brother\\", is an affecting paean to the complicated relationship between West and Jay-Z himself, his collaborator, rival, peer, and ultimately, hero. It's a graceful, and resonant way to end an incredible album. In one of his most poetic couplets, Kanye says: \\"If you admire someone you should go ahead tell 'em/people never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em\\". Nobody promised Kanye West arose garden, but this time he's earned one.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|Well if you leave this one out of your collection, that would be a HUGE Mistake.  No doubt this is a great classic that I recommend to be part of an essential collection.  Great classic songs and It's Allright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding) is a masterpiece among many others--great lirics and great song sung by Bob all alone--he doesn't need anybody but himself.  You might want to hear Maggie's Farm on the Bootleg Series 7 that is by my point of view even better since it is more lively.  I would like to suggest also Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde on Blonde and the two bootleg series (1-3 and 7) and The Essential Bob Dylan for a good essential collection.<br /><br />Trust me on this one.<br /><br />Subterranean Homesick Blues<br /><br />She Belongs to Me<br /><br />Maggie's Farm<br /><br />Love Minus Zero<br /><br />Outlaw Blues (super cool)<br /><br />On the Road Again<br /><br />Bob Dylan's 115th Dream<br /><br />Mr. Tamberine Man<br /><br />Gates of Eden<br /><br />It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding) Fabulous!<br /><br />It's All Over Now Baby Blue
0634023020|2.0|The cover of this book contains a picture of an an electric guitar.  Accordingly, I assumed that that both the music cd and guitar notation/tablature would pertain to an electric guitar.  However, the music and tablature pertains to an accousitic guitar only - not an electric guitar.  I was diappointed.  This seems to border on false advertising.
0141439661|1.0|I have seen many movies and PBS mini series that have been made out of Jane Austin novels and have loved them all.  Being an avid reader, I thought I'd LOVE to read the books too since books are so much better than anything put to the screen.  Boy was I wrong.  I just couldn't get through it.  It's written in such a form that it's hard to follow and understand what she is talking about.  I've truly had to read and re-read sentences and paragraphs to get what in the world she is talking about. Here's an example:  \\"She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present.  The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible.\\" OR:  \\"The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation.\\"  HUH??? See what I mean?  I had to work too hard at understanding much of the book and it was no longer relaxing or fun to read so I gave up.  I guess when it comes to these period pieces, I was better off watching the movies.  I wanted to return the book
B000P0J0D8|1.0|This latest edition which was released in 2007 is a single disc set and the box says enhanced for widescreen.It is not enhanced though. It is an error on Warners part. If you want it enhanced you still need to buy the two disc set. The movie is great though.
B0001GL3K4|1.0|LOVE ACTUALLY is supposed to be a warm and fuzzy film that shows us the glorious, magical, mysterious ways that love appears in all of our lives.  It fails.  After watching the movie twice, I have yet to see a single instance of \\"love\\" actually appear in the movie.  Told in a series of nine or ten alternating subplots, each storyline only gets a few minutes of screentime at a time and just when you things start to get remotely compelling, it switches to another subplot.  The end result of this is that none of the storylines are very well developed and none of the characters are developed at all.  Characterization is pretty much the most important thing to me about any work of fiction, and it was impossible for me to like this movie since I never got to know any of the twenty-odd main characters and didn't give a crap what happened to any of them.      I will say that I am normally a sucker for romantic comedies, which is what made this movie so disappointing to me.  What's wonderful about romantic comedies (normally) is all the buildup, the wonderful sexual tension that builds until you almost can't take it, the nuances and how the relationship slowly evolves...and when you're trying to cram nine full stories into 135 minutes, that just can't happen.  But you also can't just skip all this, head straight for the climax, and expect anyone to care about your characters or believe that they've fallen in love.  The storyline and characters end up all being sort of intertwined with one another in this bizarre six-degrees-of-separation kind of way (just in time for the holidays, of course), but unlike the way this is done in CRASH, which feels authentic and poignant, LOVE ACTUALLY just feels forced and contrived.    I suspect that this movie would be easily improved by cutting out half of the storylines and developing the other half, but it's not a sure thing because the majority of the storylines aren't stories of love to begin with; they're stories of lust, obsession, and infatuation.  Are we supposed to be moved by Keira Knightley's stalker, for example?  The last time *I* found out that someone was filming me without my knowledge, I thought it was creepy, not cute.  But that's just me.      If you're looking for love, try another movie.  Unfortunately, throwing a bunch of big name actors into a room and pretending it's a romantic comedy just doesn't fly.  There's nothing romantic about this one.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|The original release of Death Proof was one of the best american films of the year. Not for everyone, but for some--enjoy!!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I must first say that I was \\"extremely reluctant\\" to accept Daniel Craig into my heart as the infamous, sexy and dangerous 007. I was very upset when they decided that Pierce Brosnan would not be back. A little history....I was a BIG Sean Connery fan, and could not stand Roger Moore or the other Bonds until Brosnan. He had most of the qualities that I feel Sean Connery has......he is suave, charming, handsome and a little mysterious/dangerous...and James Bond use to be Remington Steele.  So, needless to say I didn't want another 007, just when I got use to this one. So imagine my attitude when I went to see this movie.......Daniel Craig was going to be critiqued harshly. Now with all that in mind, I must say I was pleasantly pleased. Although Daniel Craig's was 007, his spin on the character was completely different. And although he was not as suave as Sean Connery, he is just as romantic (Vesper love story crucial to the story), more so because he only tried to get with two women, versus a ton (each critical to the story).  And more than anything, he was more believable than past Bonds. He would bleed, he got hurt, he was sensitive and completely human.     This movie was great....the plot is well written, you love to hate the bad guy, you feel sorry for the hero, and I found myself beginning to embrace him as 007. I no longer view 007 as a \\"single\\" person, while for some reason in the past it seemed like writers wanted us to think of Connery, Moore, and Brosnan, as the same person.  But now, I have come to see the title of 007 as a classification, similar to the position of Inspector and Detective. And I really found myself appreciating the fact that this Bond was so human. Casino Royale is worth watching, and I would love to see Craig in the role again, in the near future.

1896597890|5.0|Personally, I follow a lot of North Korean goings-ons, especially since Kim Jong Il is such a character. I'm Korean-American so I've always been fascinated by this topic -- and I'm also a graphic artist so I've done my own share of parody artwork and interactive/digital games and illustrations about Kim Jong Il and NK culture. Anyway, this book by Guy Leslie is great. What a rare and great experience he had while visiting a country that most people could never step foot in! It was funny, informative and enlightening. I would buy it as gifts for all my friends.     If you liked this book, you'd also enjoy Art Spiegelman's graphic novels \\"Maus I: A Survivor's Tale: My Father Bleeds History \\" and its sequel \\"Maus II: A Survivor's Tale: And Here My Troubles Began\\" which are about World War II. And if you liked Maus, you'll definitely like \\"Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea\\" too.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|As an old 60 year old, I had the pleasure of seeing Pink Floyd many years ago when they did their Dark Side and Wall tours. I remember being somewhat disappointed with their sound. It seemed like they were trying to replicate the albums and couldn't quite master it. Also, sound systems in large auditoriums could be a problem.  The visuals were top notch however. I figured I'd never get to experience the total package of sound and visual but was grateful for having been a part of the show.    That all changed recently when I became aware of the Pulse DVD. I actually caught the last part of the performance on PBS television one night and in that short time was blown away with what I saw. I immediately ordered the DVD, powered up the home theater system and relived what I had missed from those live shows.    This performance is nothing short of incredible. It shows what newer technology, and seasoned musical geniuses can create. Pink Floyd has aged like a fine wine. Every track on this DVD is superb quality. The lighting, video, and music is the perfect combination.    Simply put, it's the greatest performance I have ever seem in my life. And I've seen many!
1591396190|3.0|I bought this book. Their identifications are valid enough. Great companies have always created uncontested market space while making their competitors irrelevant. This is not in dispute. However...    The authors Chan Kim & Renee Mauborgne are just mere academics. And what is annoying is that they haven't battle tested their Blue Ocean model from hard knocks in the trenches business wars to find out what works and what doesn't for themselves! Again, this is what I find annoying with academics. They say a lot but never prove it themselves! Remember Merton & Scholes and LTCM?    For an example...in the book, the authors have an interesting strategic canvass graph approach that supposes to prove how Blue Ocean events come about. That's fine, but how do you prove it? Moreover, the 'values' are different for each company, so there is nothing consistent to glean from this.    What I'd like to have seen is a Dash Board type matrix template that allows any company or budding entrepreneur to carry out Blue Ocean due diligence on any industry or market niches...proofing these Blue Ocean catchments from a zero learning curve application! The book does have important points but lacks the cutting edge tools to unify Blue Ocean diligence and proofs for any company!    Thus, what this book lacks is a more honed processing of enquiry from the authors. And I suspect this to be the case because like many academics they haven't proven the unifying dynamics that goes into capturing Blue Ocean strategies for themselves with businesses they have built through their own mindset!    Again, this book is a case of 'do what I say, because I don't have to prove what I say'.    There are great industry shapers out there who can shift and move whole industries and markets in their favour...but the authors of this book are not one of them.     However, there are great positives the authors have identified. The book contains a very interesting 'Strategic Grid' technique. From this simple grid technique any one can mentally survey how to change one's industry or market from a macro-vantage point. But shifting and moving your new found Blue Ocean grid at a tactical level to rule your competition making them irrelevant is another matter entirely. The chapters that explain this grid are worth the book, but don't expect any thing else.     What you really want is a knowledge base that allows you to dig out Blue Ocean criteria from a template of enquiring tools STACKED PROCESS BY PROCESS UNTIL YOU PROOF YOUR OWN BLUE OCEAN POWER. This book fails on this!     I would suggest that any one buying this book should read 'Blue Print to a Billion by David Thomson to understand how real Blue Ocean executions are carried out correctly. In addition, Chet Holmes' Ultimate Sales Machine' gets you to understand how to carry out big frame strategies at the tactical level.     Both these books will plug the holes lacking with Kim & Mauborgne's work.

B000NA2348|5.0|This is the fourth Bowie CD to be repackaged as a double-disc Anniversay set, and in many respects is the best value of the bunch. This time, in addition to a wonderfully remastered CD of \\"Young Americans\\" we get a DVD that contains the entire CD in a 5:1 mix (DTS is my favorite flavor), as well as two great videos from the Dick Cavett show and an interview that is interesting albeit painful to watch.<br /><br />While \\"Young Americans\\" is nowhere near the top of my list of Bowie CD's, the five stars goes for the quality and value of the package as presented. While some others have complained about the surround mix, I enjoy it immensely. If I want the original mix, it is on the CD in wonderful quality; if I want the surround mix, it is there as well. The surround mix is very active without feeling gimmicky. Frankly, I much prefer this mix to the SACD of Ziggy Stardust.<br /><br />The Dick Cavett footage is a great bonus, and includes live performances of \\"1984\\" and \\"Young Americans\\"(the latter appeared on the DVD Best of Bowie\\"). The interview segment was taped when Bowie was in the darkest hour of his well-publicized cocaine addiction, and as such is painful to watch but hard to turn off. Anyone who has seen Bowie in an interview since 1980, and is accustomed to listening to an exceptionally lucid, witty man, will be shocked by this segment.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Bowie's and are sitting on the fence about this release, I encourage you to try it out - it is a great package and well worth the purchase price. Now, if anyone out there is paying attention - please, please, please put together a special edition of Station to Station with the 1976 Nassau Coliseum concert as a bonus disc....

0446528056|4.0|We just had our book review and found that we had different opinions on the characters. I did not like the main character as I felt she stepped out of line by telling him about his Father. She was not a Doctor and had no right giving advice to him.  Where my friends felt that she was a wonderful person who only was trying to help.where they felt that she had no faults.  I didn't feel that they knew each other enough during there courtship. to wait that length of time to get together. I think the ending was unreal as how can a person in such pain find thoughts of an old love in her house even come into her and his mind. But I did like the book and enjoyed reading it. There is a lot of information in this book and I found it interesting.
0375847227|4.0|I saw the trailer for the Golden Compass prior to a Harry Potter movie. Having just finished the last HP book, I was desperate for some reading material. Since the trailer was intriguing and appeared geared for kids, I thought what the heck...let's give it a try.     First let me say, the entire trilogy of His Dark Materials, including The Golden Compass, was amazing. The details, the plot lines, the imagination - wow! After finishing the Golden Compass, I was left wanting more and had to finish the entire trilogy. HOWEVER,...    This is not, and I repeat, not a book for children. As the mom of three daughters, 6th grade, 3rd grade and 1st grade, I was amazed that the movie, based on this book, was marketed to kids via Harry Potter. The ideas presented in the book and the plot lines were confusing to me, let alone a child to understand. Even after finishing the entire trilogy I was still left at the end with a bit of \\"Huh??\\". There were so many intertwining plot lines and complex/mature material presented, there is no way a young child could understand any of it. Furthermore, the author is VERY good at providing the detail you need to get an image in your minds eye of what's going on. This is great. The problem is, these images would be downright disturbing to a kid.     My hat is off to the author - the trilogy was very entertaining and worth a second read to pick up what I missed the first time. But for shame movie producers!!! Hopefully your intent was to market this to the older HP audience. If not, what were you thinking?
0553260111|3.0|Like many people I came to this book through the movies based on Robert Ludlum's Bourne novels. I read THE JANSON DIRECTIVE several years ago (blew through it on a 30-hour train ride between Kolkata and Chennai), and though it was entertaining enough to pass the time with, I felt like it was essentially literary packing foam. I wasn't looking for Les Miserables, mind you, but Ludlum's characters are pretty mechanical, operating basically to show off a hidden world of espionage, conspiracy, and cool gadgets. There's nothing essentially wrong with this kind of novel, but I prefer character-driven fiction, where I can see personalities of some complexity and depth grapple with challenges and come out changed somehow. As far as I can tell, Ludlum didn't write this kind of novel often.    But THE BOURNE IDENTITY is an attempt at this kind of novel. The main character, so-called \\"Jason Bourne,\\" is not struggling against assassins and CIA operatives for some political agenda or even merely to save his own life. He is trying to understand himself, to learn who he is. As one character states (as an almost shameless declaration of the \\"moral of the story\\"), \\"In a way, [Bourne is] a functioning microcosm of us all. I mean, we're all trying to find out who the hell we are, aren't we?\\" Such internal conflict, however, is handled quite clumsily in Ludlum's hands, which seem unaccustomed to dealing with emotional subtleties. Credit should go to the makers of the Bourne movies (Matt Damon and the rest of the cast prominent among them) for breathing life and depth into these characters.    I was a bit disappointed at how much of the mysteries surrounding Bourne's character are resolved for the reader not through Bourne himself learning the truth, but through a significant number of scenes where Bourne's adversaries discuss the details of his past life amongst themselves. For me this sucked the momentum out of the winding up scenes, and left me feeling like I'd missed the climax.One last thing: those picking up THE BOURNE IDENTITY having seen the movies should be aware that the novel was published in 1980. While many of the basic premises remain the same, this is not exactly the same story you saw on screen. This is not at all a bad thing, but some people get really upset when they're expecting a perfect translation between literature and film or vice versa.
B00005JPLW|5.0|The movie itself is great, but there are also some very interesting extras on the dvd that make it very worthwhile to purchase and watch.
B0001US8EO|5.0|After reading previous reviews on Costner's \\"Wyatt Earp\\" I have to say that most people miss the point of this movie. Rather than trying to be an entertaining \\"Indiana Jones cliff-hanger\\" I feel the film's producers and director wanted more of a biography of the Earp family that is more historically accurate, as opposed to a \\"rock 'em sock 'em\\" adventure. This is why the film runs so long, it needs to tell a long story. The Earp's time in Tombstone and the famous OK Corral gunfight was only a fraction of the Earp's existence. It has been made into, via Hollywood and endless story-telling throughout the years, much more than it really was -- a feud between rival factions that was common in America's move West during the 19th century.     In my opinion, if the makers of the film made any blunders in the story-line and plot in regards to making an interesting big-budget western epic, they dwell too much on the old Hollywood formula of making the famous gunfight the \\"excitement fulcrum,\\" thus forcing the early part of the film to spend lots of time leading up to it. This forces the rest of the film's story of the \\"vengeance ride\\" -- a part of Wyatt Earp's and Doc Holliday's lives that was by itself exciting, with enough material for its own separate film -- seem anti-climatic. In other words, the film tries to tell too much.     That being said, I highly recommend watching this film, not for its lack of being exciting (it does has its moments however), but as a wonderful western bio-epic that captures the spirit of the old West. Dennis Quaid puts on a stellar performance as Doc Holliday (much better than Val Kilmer's more-or-less comedic approach in \\"Tombstone\\"), and it is beautifully shot, with scenes constantly augmented with a soaring soundtrack. Kevin Costner in the lead Wyatt Earp role doesn't try to make something out of nothing by over-acting. He allows the story of the Earps tell itself -- something you don't see much from actors. The strength and appeal of thismovie lies in its sum and essence, not its \\"excitement factor.\\"     As far as the lengthy edit goes, set aside 3 hours of your time, settle back, and get yourself an extra bowl of popcorn. You're in for a treat.
0375713751|1.0|This is not a book to put down lightly. It is one to have the pages stripped out and line the bottom of one's parakeet cage. This was one of the worst books I've ever read. I bought it to read the genera of I guess soap opera literature. I will not judge another woman on anything she does, but Kate is neurotic and married to a beta man and she seems to sail with no rudder. A scene between her mother and a judge near the end is supposed to impress us as some empowering motherhood thing, but in the US, you'd get booted out of court over it and a stiff fine. I couldn't imagine her saying that to one of the terrifying white wigged judges in England.    Poor character development and a bad reflection on women everywhere. This seems to have been put out by someone against motherhood and working.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|I love it! Ripper sounds amazing, The best thing about this cd is it is classic Iced Earth with GREAT vocals
B000RG1FMO|4.0|I was introduced to Kanye West when I found out that he was the producer on Beanie Sigel's \\"The Truth\\", which was one of my favorite tracks on Beanie's debut CD.  From there, Kanye produced another favorite track of mine which was \\"This Must Be Life\\" which featured Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel and Scarface.   One reason whay I liked the track so much was Kanye's use of the Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes classic \\"I Miss You\\".   Since the song had a serious tone to it, the old school sample made the song even better, in my opinion.  Kanye produced 4 tracks on Jay Z's [[ASIN:B00005O54T The Blueprint]]: \\"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\\" which was the 1st single, \\"Never Change\\", \\"Heart Of The City (Ain't No Love)\\" and one of my favorite tracks on this CD, \\"Takeover\\", which was Jay Z's lyrical stab at Nas & The former Infamous Mobb Deep.   Kanye also produced Talib Kweli's \\"Get By\\" and one of my favorite collaborations of all time, \\"Guess Who's Back\\" from Scarface's [[ASIN:B00006C2H3 The Fix]].  The track was another song that featured Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel and Scarface.    The first time that I ever heard Kanye West rap was on a track entitled \\"Champions\\" that was featured on the Paid In Full Soundtrack.   The track featured Twista, Cam'ron, Beanie Sigel, Kanye and Young Chris of the Young Gunz.   Kanye held his own but I wasn't sure where it would go from there until I heard \\"Through The Wire\\".   Kanye was in a bad car accident and what he decided to do was to show people how hungry he was to be a rapper and a producer.  So while his jaw was pretty much still wired shut he sampled Chaka Khan's \\"Through The Fire\\" and created his official entry into the rap game.   The next track that I heard was \\"Slow Jamz\\" which was a collabroation between Kanye West, Jamie Foxx & Twista.   The track was clearly made for the ladies but it was so catchy that you couldn't help to like it especially with the sped up sample from the late, great Luther Vandross on \\"A House Is Not A Home\\".       When [[ASIN:B0001AP12GThe College Dropout]] came out I was impressed because I knew Kanye had the production skills but I would have never figured out that he had the lyrical skills to carry a full CD.   My favorites included \\"Jesus Walks\\", \\"Never Let Me Down\\" w/Jay-Z and J. Ivy, \\"Two Words\\" w/Mos Def & Freeway, \\"We Don't Care\\", \\"Last Call\\" and \\"Spaceship\\" w/GLC and Consequence.  \\"College Dropout\\" went on to go double platinum.  A year later Kanye dropped [[ASIN:B0009WPKY0 Late Registration]].  It seems as if Kanye wanted to come right back out with another CD to capitalize off of the momentum from \\"College Dropout\\".  My favorite tracks were \\"We Major\\" w/Nas, the remix to the first single, \\"Dimaonds From Sierra Leone\\" w/Jay-Z, \\"Heard 'Em Say\\" w/Adam Levine from Maroon 5, which was a beat that Common had turned down, \\"Gone\\" w/Consequence and Cam'ron and \\"Late\\", which was the last track on the CD.  People can have debates on whether or not both of these CDs were classics but I know that I when I listened to the CDs, I could listen to every track, skits included, without skipping a track.       This time around, Kanye West has returned with his 3rd Disc, \\"Graduation\\".   If you have \\"Late Registration\\" there is a track entitled \\"Celebration\\" where Kanye seemed to be celebrating the success of his debut CD and all of the production credits he has received over the years.  The reason why I bring this up is because this is what \\"Graduation\\" is all about.   It seems to be a album that was made to celebrate the success of Kanye \\"graduating\\" and making it on his own terms.   The 1st single, \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\" was originally scheduled to be a remix to Young Jeezy's \\"I Get Money\\" which appeared on Jeezy's latest CD, \\"The Inspiration\\".  The track featured TI and was produced by DJ Toomp who produced TI's classic \\"What You Know\\" from his \\"King\\" CD.  \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\" is really the street single in my opinion where \\"Stronger\\" is probably the official 1st single.   \\"Stronger\\" was made strictly for the clubs.  It's obvious that Kanye uses his clever rhymes throughout the track with lines like \\"You know how long I been on 'ya\\", since Prince was on Appolonia, since OJ had Isotoners, don't act like I never told 'ya\\".   \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\" is the stronger track but I understand why Kanye would want to make \\"Stronger\\" the official single.   The next single is \\"Good Life\\" which features T-Pain.  The song includes a sample of Michael Jackson's \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\" from his \\"Thriller\\" CD.  The song is decent but compared to Kanye singles from the past it doesn't do too much for me.  It follows the same celebratory path that Kanye intended to have for this CD.   \\"Graduation\\" gets off to a good start with \\"Good Morning\\" which serves as the intro for the CD.   Kanye gives us some nice bars to let you know that he is ready to introduce CD#3 to us.  \\"Champion\\" is decent but I think the track suffers from a case of overproduction.   Kanye West is a perfectionist in his own right but in my opinion he should simplify things at times.   His lyrics are on point, but I have heard better from Kanye.  I admire his shout out to Lauryn Hill when he says that he wishes that her heart was still into rhyming.  The sample on \\"I Wonder\\" is just sick.   However, Kanye takes too long to get things started. The verse starts almost 3 minutes into the song.   However, the beat will help you overcome any shortcomings that you have about the song.   \\"Barry Bonds\\" features Lil Wayne as most CDs do nowadays.  I was floored when I saw that he was scheduled to be on Little Brother's new CD, [[ASIN:B000TURBVC Getback]], on a track entitled \\"Breakin' My Heart\\".  The CD is scheduled to be released on October 23, 2007.   \\"Barry Bonds\\" is basically a nice beat from Kanye that features 2 verses from him and a nice lyrical contribution from Lil Wayne, despite what most people may think.   I agree that Lil Wayne shouldn't be on 75 mixtapes and 125 guest appearances in 1 year, but you have to give hum his credit when its due.  \\"Flashing Lights\\" features Dwele who appeared on Common's \\"The People\\" from [[ASIN:B000RN86BK Finding Forever]].    This track is easily one of the better tracks on \\"Graduation\\" as Kanye makes a track that talks about a girl who is going to far to attain the finer things in life.  Just like Common was talking about on \\"Drivin' Me Wild\\".   When I heard, \\"Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA....like Martin with no Gina\\", I thougt to myself that's the Kanye that I have come to respect and like.  He wins with clever rhymes.  My favorite track is easily \\"Everywhere I Am\\", which includes scratches from DJ Premier.   The beat reminds me of Scarface's \\"My Block\\", which Kanye also produced.  The track is really laid back and mellow.  \\"Glory\\" is also a decent track and it reminds you of something that Kanye would have produced for Jay-Z on \\"The Blueprint\\".  Someone has seemed to make Kanye upset, just as MTV did this past weekend and you can hear the anger in his lyrics.   However, he still adds his playfulness on the last verse.    I understand Kanye's concept for this CD but no track captures that better than \\"Homecoming\\" which features Chris Martin from Coldplay.   My favorite song from Jay-Z's [[ASIN:B000JJSRUM Kingdom Come]] was \\"Beach Chair\\" which also featured Chris Martin on the track.   I may have to start checking out some of Coldplay's work.  Anyway, you can tell by the end of \\"Homecoming\\" that Kanye has mentally walked across the stage and is celebrating the finest moments of his accomplishments.  The problem is that some of the other tracks on \\"Graduation\\" don't achieve the same success.    Kanye's tribute to Jay-Z on \\"Big Brother\\" is phenominal.   When Kanye wants to he can create memorable anthems that you will want to hear for years to come.  \\"Big Brother\\" is clearly an example of that.  The honesty and realness of the track can't be denied and its right up there with \\"Jesus Walks\\" and \\"Last Call\\" with the effect that it leaves on you after you listen to the song.    At 13 tracks, many people expected more from Kanye's \\"Graduation\\".   Kanye is one of the few artists that I can accept skits from because they are always funny and they always fall in line with the sequence of the tracks.   It would have been nice to hear more of that this time around.   I thought that Kanye would have atleast included \\"Bittersweet\\" w/John Mayer and the remix to \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\" w/Young Jeezy.  Also, I can understand cutting the guest appearances but I would rather hear Mos Def rap on \\"Drunk And Hot Girls\\" then try to sing like he did on \\"Umi Says\\", which is still a fantastic track 'til this day.   In the end, most listeners will realize that \\"Graduation\\" is a nice CD but if you compare this CD to \\"College Dropout\\" and \\"Late Registration\\", this CD doesn't stack up to them.   It's not as bad as some people are making \\"Graduation\\" to seem, but at the same time it's not as great as his previous work.   \\"Graduation\\" was a concept album, however, so was \\"College Dropout\\" and \\"Late Registration\\".  If you're making a concept album the overall quality of the project shouldn't be compromised.  However, if you are a Kanye West fan, this is still a nice addition to your CD collection.    James' Top 6    1) Everything I Am  2) Big Brother  3) Homecoming w/Chris Martin  4) Flashing Lights w/Dwele  5) Can't Tell Me Nothing  6) Good Morning    Honorable Mention:    The Glory  Barry Bonds w/Lil Wayne  I Wonder  Stronger
B000002GXJ|4.0|This is a decent live album of their heyday, but I have to admit the Live at Melbourne DVD is superior to it, and costs less.     Back when they put this out, it made sense that the 15 songs included were the most they could put out at the time, songs like \\"Hotel California\\" and \\"Life's Been Good\\" are long songs. However, 20 years later, having heard the bootlegs there's a lot of great songs they did live at the time missing.     Here's just a small list of the songs not on here that exist on bootlegs and I'm sure they have the masters:     Lyin Eyes, Witchy Woman, Tequila Sunrise, Already Gone, Peaceful Easy Feeling, One of These Nights, Best of My Love, In The City, Sad Cafe. Ol' 55. Those Shoes. Midnight Flyer. Doolin Dalton. James Dean. The Chuck Berry cover \\"Carol\\".     The Joe songs? Funk 49, Turn To Stone, Walk Away, Rocky Mountain Way.      It's a \\"good enough\\" collection of live songs, but it would be nice to hear some of these songs added in to make it an essential to have. A band known for excess fell short on this when it came time to put it out on CD.
1416524800|4.0|I have read \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and that was my first book by Dan Brown. Next, I read \\"Angels and Demons\\" then \\"Deception Point\\". In my opinion, Deception Point was the best of these great books. The story is full of action which is set during a presidential election, and then the author throws in some unsavory political characters that make the plot of this book very suspenseful. This is certainly an easy read and the writing style makes it an excellent bedside book. Check it out and have a good read.
0440238609|1.0|I thought this series would be a fun adventure like reading the Harry Potter books so I purchased a set for myself and another for my grandson to give as a gift for Christmas. After reading the series I discovered that I was wrong. It left me with an uncomfortable feeling, my spirit had been wounded.  It wasn't a good feeling like I had in Harry Potter where my spirit felt uplifted and I wanted more.     In reading The Golden Compus you get caught up in the adventure of Lyra and all those who assist her in fulfilling her prophetic destiny. It was the best out of the three and If you're going to read the series I'd advise stopping there.  In order to discover the whole of her prophetic destiny you need to continue with  The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass for they bring this prophetic destiny into view and it's not what you think as you're reading the first volume.  The storys main charactors fight to bring about the distruction of the kingdom of Heaven and the death of God.  Lyra's destiny is to bring about a new republic, a republic of Heaven, where God does not exist.     I felt a great dissapointment in the theme of the books and the publicity it is getting as a bestseller. It's as if the story is being told by an anti Christ and it's message shows God and the Kingdom of Heaven and all those who support him as evil and all those who fight to destroy him and his kingdom as good.    I'm going to send the set I purchased for my grandson back for a refund.
B000QFCD5O|4.0|Wow it is great to hear the original line up again, and John Wetton's voice seems stronger than ever.  Some sound just like the original songs and others sound like arrangements that would have been worth seeing live...we can only hope thet are up to going into the studio and creating some more magic!!!
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I love the story. I just found out about Brandi a few weeks ago. She fills that \\"closer to fine\\" void in todays music. Love her!
1401211909|5.0|Such a beautiful book and much better than the movie -- except for Robert DeNiro!
B000SNUMC0|5.0|After 6 years of being an Iced Earth fan and anticipating this album that whole time, I am glad to say that this album was well worth the wait.  Jon Schaffer has truly outdone himself here.  The music, the orchestration, the lyrics, the awesome metal riffs; everything is here.      Glorious Burden is a good album, but it felt more like an album to test the waters than a typical solid IE release.  With the band changing record labels as well as its singer, it just seemed like a hit or miss album with some awesome tracks but a few I didn't care for so much.  However, any doubts this had created about this epic follow up are put entirely to rest.  This is IE's best album to date.  Ripper is at the top of his game with a sound that feels like it was crafted just for him, and this may sound like heresy to some, but I find it difficult to imagine Barlow's low, haunting tone on some of these tracks.  And with all the great music that flows so wonderfully together, we also have a very well thought and complex sci-fi story that Schaffer has poured his blood and emotion into (The scope and story are more ambitious than a lot of sci-fi that I've read from novelists.)  Just brilliant.    There are 19 tracks total on this concept album behemoth, too many to comment on each one, but there are definitely some notable standout tracks:    The album begins with \\"Overture\\", which sets the tone wonderfully.  It has a very eastern feel with lots of string instruments and bongo style drums.  It paves the way nicely for the opener track, \\"Something Wicked Pt 1\\".  This track is mind blowing.  I was expecting to hear the redone version of Prophecy that I heard on the single, but this is its own song.  It begins with a stunning riff that seems to be a combination of old Metallica and Beethoven.   \\"The Setian Massacre\\" I had already heard on the band's myspace page and it's a nice hard rocking track, reminiscent of The Reckoning.  \\"A Charge to Keep\\" is Framing Armageddon's first ballad, and IE has exceeded their standards with great ballads on this one.      \\"Ten Thousand Strong\\" is arguably the best track on the album.  Even though I already heard it with the Overture single, the buildup intro track Reflections puts it in a whole new context.  Just amazing.  This is one of those songs that makes you want to raise your fist and cheer.      \\"The Clouding\\" is definitely the most unique of this CD, and I don't believe we've heard anything like it before.  It's long -at about 9 minutes- and the first 5 of those are in a slow ballad style with some ambient guitar not unlike Pink Floyd.  It turns into a hard rocker with a riff that would fit right at home in an early Sabbath album.  Pretty cool song.  Framing doesn't stop rocking there either.  It continues with \\"Order of the Rose\\", \\"Infiltrate and Assimilate\\" (reminds me of Violate or Disciples), the epic \\"Domino Decree\\" and the title track \\"Framing Armageddon\\".    Those may be the tracks of note, but there is nothing unworthy of Iced Earth in the entire album.  Every song, including the few short bridge tracks, flow well into each other to tell this story.  The lyrics are thoughtful and well sung by the ever versatile Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens.  And of course, we have the riffing, the trademark style that is all Schaffer and that keeps me loving this band with every release.    Jon Schaffer, if you are to read this, I tip my hat to you.  This is your best work yet and you are an inspiration to anyone who aspires to do something great.    This album is amazing, and anyone who likes metal, nay music, weather or not they have listened to IE or not before, should buy this album.  I eagerly await part 2!  Cheers and rock the f*** on!
B000RG1FMO|2.0|i just don't feel this album at all. Kayne West is a Marginal Rapper and his beats and overall Grooves feel like alot of the Production and tracks that are getting played today which have a 80's feel. that works some times and other times it feels cold and leaves alot of soul out of the sound. Kayne Lyrically is a Pop reference style of rapper. he is catchy at times,but more often than not he just doesn't hold my attention for more than a few tracks. there isn't really a standout track to me,but more of a few catchy tracks than a actual song that knocks me out. this album feels in alot of ways as another  part of the previous two for better or for worse.
B00003CWN3|5.0|Hilary Swank is phenomenal in her role as Brandon Teena.  This film is true to life regarding most of the circumstances surrounding the tragic story.  With the exception of a few changes made from the book \\"All She Wanted\\" by Aphrodite Jones, the film is perfect.  The tragedy of this story and struggle that Brandon went through in his short life is heartbreaking.  It shows the dangers of intolerance.  No one should be subjected to such ignorance.  If you have never cried watching a movie, you will cry watching this one.  It leaves a lasting impression.
1426458975|3.0|Chesterton's \\"Orthodoxy\\" and Lewis' \\"Mere Christianity\\" are classics of contemporary Christian apologetics. Both write to a similar audience, namely, secular academics. Lewis' appeal was broader, however, for he was reaching out to those people influenced or educated by these academics. Consequently, these books are full of reason and logic but are devoid of Bible quotes. This might dismay some fundamentalists, but this type of apologetic is absolutely necessary. Just as a Muslim will not convince a Christian regarding Islam by quoting the Qu'ran, so, in most cases, a Christian will not convert a secular academic by quoting the Bible. The appeal must be made on common ground, in this case, reason and logic. In this regard, Chesterton succeeds.<br /><br />That being said, I give the book only 3 stars because of his rambling, time-sensitive style. It is easy for an American reading in the 21st century to become completely lost in Chesterton's quips and references to late-modernity intellectuals.<br /><br />Lewis' broader appeal makes him more accessible to Chesterton, so I recommend \\"Mere Christianity\\" over \\"Orthodoxy\\" to the average 21st century American, whereas I recommend \\"Orthodoxy\\" to those who are educated in late 19th and early 20th-century intellectualism.<br /><br />Both books are useful for Christians in developing apologetic skills and for non-Christians, especially seculars, in understanding a traditional, intellectual, and non-fundamentalist brand of Christianity.
B00000JNO1|4.0|Skynyrd's 3rd album sees the first changes in the band's lineup.  Original drummer Bob Burns is replaced by Artimus Pyle.  The album was a bit of a rush job as the record company was pushing the band to come out with a new album as quickly as possible after the huge success of their previous effort.  As the title suggests the songs here are a bit on the simpler side, but the band still breathes plenty of life into them.  \\"Saturday Night Special\\" was the big hit from the album with \\"On The Hunt\\" and \\"Whiskey Rock-A Roller\\" also receiving airplay.  The rest of the material is pretty typical Skynyrd all well written and performed.  The album is probably not as strong as the first two, but is still well worth owning for Skynyrd fans.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Kanye West is notorious for a unique style that puts him a cut above most artists these days. With original beats and hooks he makes sure that Roc-A-Fella records keeps selling albums, and continues to provide hip hop with great music to keep heads banging. With his new album, Graduation, he continues to show us the same Kanye we all know and love, but he falls short in some areas. His lyrics don't seem to be along the same lines as he used to be, leaning more towards spitting about fame and being the best instead of what we saw in albums like College Dropout and Late Registration. Luckily his style is his own that he keeps out of the \\"rap star\\" light and remain an artist for the hip hop fans who hate were rap is headed these days (like myself), and normal \\"rap\\" fans alike. To the uneducated ear Graduation has some hot beats and good lyrics. To the more lyrically inclined who love to hear artists mix words together nicely, Kanye brings in yet another hit album. My only real gripe, and the whole reason it didn't get 5 stars, was the track titled \\"Barry Bonds\\", and Kanye isn't even to blame, Lil' Wayne is. He should have stayed low key and not brought himself back up to the light. Wayne's style and lyrics are just pitiful. He tries to mimic West's style and lyrical composure and it just comes out like a young rapper trying to be like his idol west, and coming from someone who's been around the game as long as Wayne, this is unacceptable. I miss great Wayne tracks like Shine and Way of Life.   Overall a great album in the eyes of this hardcore Kanye West fan. In my eyes, one of the few artists to have the genius and bravery to tackle hip hop as an artist and producer and make tracks with lesser known but great artists like Talib Kweli and the mighty Mos Def.   4 out of 5 teetering on 5 stars, but still a great album!
B00005RIKI|5.0|I grew up in the era where southern rock had it's hey day and Lynard Skynard was the king of them all.  On this their debut album, the band shot out of the gate right from the start with one of their best discs.  This album is best known as the disc that produced one of the most popular classic rock songs in history \\"Free Bird\\" which closes the album.  The disc also contains the Sknyrd classics \\"I Ain't The One\\", \\"Tuesday's Gone\\", \\"Gimme Three Steps\\", and \\"Simple Man\\" all songs that continue to receive airplay to this day.  The other three songs \\"Things Going On\\", \\"Mississippi Kid\\", and \\"Poison Whiskey\\" are all solid as well.  This is definitely one of Skynyrd's best and a southern rock classic album.
B00005NSAV|5.0|I must admit, I bought this CD for \\"Hocus Pocus,\\" one of the two songs for Focus that ever charted. (I'm sure Hocus Pocus was and has been viewed as a novelty song worthy of Dr. Demento's \\"Funny Five.\\") However, I did read other reviews of the band's material, and decided on this record (I still call them records) as a good representation of their work to get started with. I regret I never discovered them before now; I only remember hearing \\"Hocus Pocus\\" on late-night radio.<br /><br />I'm hooked; although I hear they've re-formed and are recording again, I'll be playing catch-up for a while, and I'll try not to have expectations of their new work. I just love this particular album (I still call them albums,) and I'm going to be listening to it a lot.
B000002P74|5.0|The band's sophomore album would produce probably their biggest hit and a song that is still a southern rock album to this day \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" which opens the album.  This is another CD that is chock full of southern rock classics and is probably as good as the bands debut.  \\"I Need You\\". \\"Don't Ask Me No Questions\\", \\"Workin For MCA\\", \\"Ballad Of Curtis Lowe\\", \\"Swamp Music\\", \\"Needle And The Spoon\\", and \\"Call Me The Breeze\\" are all great songs that define what southern rock is all about.

B000683VI4|4.0|This sweet and passionate love story rises above all it's clich&eacute;s because of the likable stars chemistry and a story that moves along briskly. The love story is sad enough, but the Alzheimer's angle really tears your heart out! I watched this because my wife wanted to watch it on our anniversary. I was surprised how much I liked it.....so guys don't squirm too much, if your babe wants to watch this one, it's really a very good story and I admired Gosling's character's tenacity and devotion to his true love. One of the better romance films I've seen in a while, so I rate it 4 1/2 stars, but it's definitely a 5 tissue movie! This was mostly because of the Alzheimer's part of the film, it's a tragic disease and having dealt with it in my family it was a little too close to home. The DVD transfer looks very good and the are some interesting extras.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|After seeing the movie \\"Once,\\" I IMMEDIATELY bought the soundtrack.  I have never heard a more original, soulful, successful collaboration than that of Glen Hansard & Marketa Irglova.  Her beautiful lyricism combined with his gritty rock realism create not only a fantastic sound, but a fantastic experience.
B000M4RG42|1.0|What is the point of this movie . . that American Indians have an alcohol problem, or that the raising of the flag on Iwo Jima was somehow a show, with meaning only for the publicists at that time.  That a flag was raised twice is fine, and that there was some confusion over who was actually in the picture is also credible.  But harping on one of the soldiers sour disposition, and his drinking problem just didn't seem to belong.  And the insistence that the USA would run out of money unless the surviving soldiers put on shows across the country to help raise funds didn't seem appropriate  either.  Of all the problems we were faced with during the Good War, the inability for the Government to print money when required was not one of them.<br /><br />This movie tried to sensationalize a very somber event, representing a major triumph of US forces over the Japanese.  It shouldn't have. The raising of the flag should be an event best left to history.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|First go around, I had to clean my glasses because they were fogged with tears from laughing so hard.  \\"Shaun\\" is truly one of the most bizarrely funny cult films I have ever seen.     Since I had some trouble with my Mac scanning the DVD, I watched for a second time.  What jumped out at me was Shaun's manager's pep-talk about 'teams' and what a study of human nature Shaun and his group would make.  We saw thinking outside of the box, bravery in the least expected places, selflessness, and how utterly stupid the panicked group Critic could be.      Seriously, if the corporate trainers ever get tired of making their teams climb rock walls and build paper gizmos that nobody will ever use, they ought to have employees watch this film--twice--so they can see human nature in action.      Wouldn't dealing with zombies be a great way to explain difficult tech support calls?  How many uses can you find for this scenario?     \\"Shaun\\" is a great film on both the funny and the serious levels.  And it is one to be watched more than once.  I seriously regret not seeing it in the theatre.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanye West is back at it again with his third album, complete with signature production, sped up vocal samples, Louis Vuitton shoutouts, and well-warranted confidence.  Mr. West has established himself as the cream of the crop, refreshing the hip-hop scene with quality music even those outside the genre can appreciate.      The album kicks off with \\"Good Morning,\\" featuring a sample from Elton John's \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\\" and Kanye proclaiming \\"This is my dissertation...welcome to Graduation.\\" The proud, upbeat \\"Champion\\" sounds exactly as the title suggests.  \\"Stronger,\\" the massive, pre-album single, has Kanye stepping outside the boundaries with a Daft Punk sample that works both inside and outside the club.      \\"Good Life\\" is a surefire hit single, a feel good track that makes good use of what is a questionable choice of a guest star (T-Pain).  \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing,\\" the first street single released from this album, flirts dangerously with the overdone but popular slow, Southern hip-hop sound.  \\"Barry Bonds\\" is the only track that really misses the mark on this album.  The beat is uninspiring and the very distracting Lil Wayne collaboration is subpar and not worthy of appearing on an album of this quality.      \\"Everything I Am\\" is a standout, featuring a perfect, mellow, piano hook underneath Kanye rapping about how he is unlike most gangster-oriented rappers.  West's flow is outstanding as is the beat in the driving \\"The Glory.\\" Kanye's collaboration with Coldplay frontman Chris Martin on \\"Homecoming\\" turns out to be a success.  Martin bangs out a piano hook and sings in the chorus, \\"Do you think about me now and then/I'm coming home again/Maybe we can start again.\\" Finally, the album closes with the excellent \\"Big Brother,\\" a track about Kanye's thoughts on his mentor Jay-Z.         Kanye West is one of the few artists who can release an album that exceeds the hype surrounding it.  Most of the songs on here are right on target, making this an album that will appear near the top on numerous year-end Top-Ten lists.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I saw Van Halen in 1978 warm up Journey at the Palace Theater in Albany, NY.  Nobody had heard of them.  They were so electrifying that to this day I will never forget that show.  It was historical.  To me, the 1st  Van Halen is the best rock album ever made.  Hands down.
0887081770|2.0|THE STORY WAS EXCELLENT,MY CHILDREN LOVED IT, I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE SIZE OF THE BOOK.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Well Kanye vs. 50, who would u choose? Even though deep down as much as i hate to admit it, i believe most of the hip hop fan base will choose 50 because he is harder. Despite Kanye being a far more talented musician, i still think that 50 will out sell Kanye. Because for some reason people always buy into 50's music. Even though almost all websites say its an average album at best, even on this website at the time i wrote this, his new album Curtis, only had an average rating of two and a half stars! But i still bet more people buy 50, while Kanyes album is getting a four star average, among getting raved by most websites as this years best Hip Hop album. But Kanye still wont outsell 50 i bet. With all that said, doesnt this kinda show u where music is heading? I mean if 800,000 people are gonna buy Curtis, and only 600,000 are gonna buy Graduation, what does that tell u about the status music is in right now. It tells u that people are more intrested in listening to music about people getting shot, robbery, sex, drugs, and money. And 50 is not the worst rapper by any means, its just he is the head runner in his gangsta rap genre. Now i know Kanye has songs about those topics to but not as much of it is based on that, and he writes songs about other things as well. Now all this said i am gonna feel like an idiot if Kanye outsells 50 lol! But why do people feel so attracted to gangsta rap, most of it has no substance. And i know half of 50's first week sales are coming from little high school kids who wanna be cool and try to be gangsta. Sorry 50, but u know its true. While Kanye's album was not flawless, it was still an excellent show case that there is still real hip hop music alive, and that people can still get air play off of other types of hip hop besides gangsta rap. See the thing with Kanye is that he does not pose for anyone. He is Kanye, thats it. He does not try to be a gangsta, a rocker, a singer, he is just Kanye. Yes he ties those three elements into his albums, and thats what makes his music so intresting, but he never tries to be something he is not. But Graduation continues right where Late Registration left off, minus the super dark feelings. I consider Graduation the middle aged popular and outgoing brother among the dark and not popular older brother Later Registration, and the youngest immature but still has lots of skills for his age College Dropout. While Graduation is not flawless, it still has many shining points. The obvious shinging spots are the first two singles \\"Stronger\\" which almost everyone has heard this techno/rap banger, and the original first single \\"Can't Tell Me Nothin'\\" which is the more slowed down meaningful song where Kanye attacks his problems and brings them to the table. And now the song off the album that i think will make the biggest splash and gain the most air play is the third single \\"Goodlife\\" which is a up tempo track that samples Michael Jackson's \\"PYT\\" and features T-Pain. Kanye performed Goodlife at the VMA's a few nights ago and stole the show with this track. Expect to hear this track all over the radio in a few weeks. The other standout track that comes to mind after the first listen to the album is \\"I Wonder\\" which is a more slow tempo dreamy song that will be a favorite amongst many. Another great track is \\"Homecoming\\" which just has a great piano line, and his lyrics on this track are so true and people are going to be able to relate to them. When all i said and done, i really think there are only two rappers left that i think can still keep intellegent hip hop alive, one being Kanye West of course because hate him of love him, u have to give him props for his musical genius, and the other rapper is Kanyes partner in crime Common, who if u havent already go cop his new album Finding Forever because these two are the saviors for hip hop that is listenable. Kanye is not God, but as far as rap goes he is the closest thing to a rap God as there will be for a while. Buythe album, there may not be another like it in a while now that both Kanye and Common just put out their new albums.       Grade:   B+
B000RG1FMO|4.0|First off I'm not the biggest Kanye West fan.. but somehow I store bought his first 2 albums.  In all, the reason is as others have stated.  He's a great producer and you can expect good beats to come from this man.  But his lyrics are WAAAY under par.  Don't get me wrong he is very talented and deserves what he's got.  Personally I don't like his cocky-ness and how he throws a fit everytime he doesn't win a VMA.  He's got multi platinum albums, what more could you ask for.  He's paid better than most.  I've been a hip hop fan for like 15 years and I really don't like where it's gone.  It's all money, women and jewelry.  Kanye kind of puts a new flavor in hip hop.  At least he's original and differs from the rest of the pack.  Back to the album, it's good.  Nothing close to a masterpiece but worth picking up.  The intro's really good and kind of draws you in.  Stronger is a pretty good single, but he raps about isotoners and klondike bars (?..wtf).  Lyrically, the best song on the album is \\"Everything I am\\".  \\"Homecoming\\" is good cuz it's different and has a real mellow feel.  \\"Big Brother\\" is really good too because he puts his aroggance aside and lifts up Jay-Z (who brought Kanye into the game).  I hate to touch on the 50 cent battle, but I also heard 50's new record and it's GARBAGE.  I really liked \\"Massacre\\" and thought his first record was pretty good.  But this new one really isn't worth picking up, or even listening to.  In conclusion, Kanye is cocky, ungrateful, and really immature when it comes to awards.  But talented (aside from writing lyrics) and reliable as a musician, he is.  The album really is worth picking up.  Pretty much because it's a breath of fresh air in hip hop.  It's not blood soaked and glittering with diamonds.  It's more of a feel good, sit back and enjoy a record.  BUY IT!
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Well, I got both 50's album as well as Graduation and I gotta say Kanye did it again. Graduation is SOOOOO GOOOD!!!! BUY IT!!!! Graduation is better because it has better songs than Curtis and Kanye has more songs featuring different people such as Daft punk(Stronger) and t pain (good life), don't get me wrong Curtis is still ill but Kanye took it.
0451209338|4.0|I thought \\"The Kill Artist\\" was a good blend of fast paced action, a decent level of historical/political intrigue, and engaging characters.  Though stylistically not the level of Le Carre or Greene, \\"The Kill Artist\\" reaches the level of works by those writers due to the pathos and world weariness of the characters.  I enjoyed it more than enough to want to start the second in the series without delay.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This album is great from the first track to the last. Kanye has done it again!
B000O77SOK|5.0|Just putting in my 5 stars.    Only thing that needs to be changed (although not show related) is a \\"PLAY ALL\\" button needs to be added.
B00006JQU1|5.0|The first thing that struck me about her playing was the perfect authenticity of her Baroque style. But of course, playing today, having heard CPE, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahams, Webern and so on, it is not possible to attain geniune 'authenticity'.<br />Why then, does it sound so?<br /><br />The second thing I noticed about Podger's playing was the most important: she seems to have imbibed the spirit of Baroque performance practice so well that it is now requires no conscious effort. Most have to 'think Baroque', put on their 'Baroque hat' etc - not so Podger. I reffer you to the difference between Jazz players and session players doing a jazz gig. The later is conciously trying to play in the jazz style with reference to everything they have learned about jazz, the former simply plays.<br /><br />This answers my earlier question. The one aspect of Baroque authenticity missing from most period performance is this 'jazz factor'. The Musicians of old would not have thought twice about an ornament if they felt it while playing. It came as naturally as a turn of phrase comes to the good modern player. The Baroque style must be so well learned, understood and assimilated as to be no longer a conscious effort.<br /><br /> This is exactly the case for Podger and to a greater degree than any other period performer. Undoubtedly her best work is done in the major key, but otherwise a magnificent achievement.<br /><br />A Million stars
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Upon hearing of the soon-to-be arrival of TDG's second album, I must admit I was quite pleased with the news. However, it took me a while to get to that stage. Like many, I got to know TDG with such songs as &#34;(I Hate) Everything About you&#34;, &#34;Just Like You&#34;, and &#34;Home&#34;. All very well-done songs in the Grunge/Rock world, and quite catchy at that. But how far did this band from Canada really go with their music? Needless to say, this skepticism kept me from purchasing their first and self-titled album for quite some time. But when I broke down and purchased it, I knew I had found a new band to enjoy as much as my other favorites.  Like a lot of bands, TDG started out small and grew with time. That's especially said since vocalist/guitarist Adam Gontier along with band member Brad Walst grew up in a small town in Canada with a population of 1,500. Regardless, their music is anything but a few small-town hits.  To be honest, One-X was not what I thought it'd be the first time I listened to it. After hearing the first single &#34;Animal I Have Become&#34;, I figured this would be another album close to their debut - a fairly hard-hitting rock album. Quite the contrary, TDG kept to their original style, but added some new sound and maturity to their work.  So it may take a listen or two to get this album in your head. But once it does, it may not leave. Adam's lyrics go a lot deeper than they ever did in their first album -- and I like it! Such songs as &#34;Animal I Have Become&#34;, &#34;Never Too Late&#34;, &#34;Over and Over&#34;, and &#34;One-X&#34; will stick in your mind for hours after you listen to them, and you'll find yourself listening to this album more and more. And each time, you'll find something new and exciting to enjoy from Three Days Grace.  Truly, I am really impressed with these guys. They have gone from not much to quite a whole lot in a relatively short period of time. I'm loving their music, and I love the fact that they didn't stay the same and actually came together to grow as an even better band.
0679735259|2.0|Although I have a fascination with history, This book is just impossible to read. I must say i dislike the writing style. He keeps on and on and you dont get much out of it. I can't read pass page 57...

B000EGCITG|5.0|Another fantastic album from Pink.  The lyrics are beautifully written, inspiring women to respect themselves and be proud of who they are.  She bares her soul, but with an \\"in your face\\" attitude, which I love.
0743455967|5.0|Part memoir, part guide to writing, Stephen King's On Writing is an enjoyable, fast paced, and easy read.  King tells his life story in a frank and funny manner which is almost certain to coax laughter from readers.  Near the end of the book, when King recounts his near-death experience, the tale is almost heartbreaking, but it is a tale of survival, love, and determination.  Even readers who have never read any of Stephen King's work before can appreciate this book.  I had never read any of Stephen King's work before, other than a wonderful short story entitled \\"The Reach,\\" but I found On Writing to be interesting and informative.  King's life story is fascinating, and his instruction on the art of writing is invaluable.<br /><br /> This book is a must-read for anyone who has ever dreamed of becoming a writer or who is currently an aspiring writer.  On Writing has great tips about the writing, editing, and publishing process.  King gives readers a rare look at his creative process, discussing changes he has made in his work and his struggles to complete some of his stories.  His advice about the art of writing is simple.  If you want to write, you have to be committed to writing.  Becoming an author does not happen overnight, and it does not happen without a great deal of effort.  Do what you love, and if that happens to be writing, then read and write to your heart's content.  Writing should be for enjoyment.  If writing reaps greater benefits that the sheer joy of writing, then so be it, and welcome.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly Clarkson knows her audience better than the music execs.  This is a wonderful collection of songs, and I love it.  I had read articles about the differences between her and the execs concerning this album, with predictions that she was jeopardizing her career with this release.  I bought it anyway, and glad I did.  Bravo Kelly!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This album is quite a bit different from her previous 2. Her first album was ALLL American Idol influence but still was really good with more ballads and she was definitely showing off her voice. Her 2nd album she chose the \\"rock/pop\\" path, which was the best idea of hers yet..\\"Breakaway\\" I still think is my favorite because it's fun and has got some killer songs on it. I liked every song on it. Now, for \\"My December\\"..Great album. Don't let Clive Davis' words haunt you. He's an old man and thinks that pop is all people want. He's wrong. This album strays away from her pop sound with the exception of a couple songs like \\"Never Again\\" (which is amazing!). She's not trying to be as \\"rock\\" on this one as she was on \\"Breakaway\\" but she directed towards a more bluesy/rock. She uses old style vocals on quite a few songs and this album is definitely much darker than her previous albums. She also really doesn't showcase her voice as much as she usually does, but that's not a bad thing either. This album is really great and she's really showing her maturity. \\"Sober\\" is a beautifully haunting type of song and her new style is amazing. I would recommend this album to any Kelly Clarkson fan or even people that aren't normally fans. Give it a chance at least. If you don't like it AS much the first listen, listen again...it takes some getting used to the new sound, but i guarantee you'll like it once you do! :)
B000LC55F2|5.0|Just so we can stem the tide of surly, dissatisfied reviewers who obviously lack an imagination or sense of wonder:    THERE IS SCIENCE FICTION IN THIS MOVIE. THERE IS FANTASY IN THIS MOVIE.    Ok? It's not a moldy period piece about the 19th century. If that's what you are looking for, look elsewhere.    Now, for those of you who actually have an imagination and enjoy seeing the impossible become possible: The Prestige was probably the best picture of 2006, despite what Oscar thought. A fantastic film. Five stars!
B000H305U0|4.0|Okay, first I will say that I wasn't a big fan of N*Sync, I was more into the Backstreet Boys(btw their newer albums are awesome! way different from back in the 90's). Anyway! I really really like \\"Justified\\" regardless of what the reviews say. I loved the sound..it was still pop-ish but had a new R&B feel to it. This album is really great. I LOOOVE \\"Love Stoned\\", \\"Summer Love\\", \\"What Goes Around...\\" and of course \\"Sexyback\\"..i gave it 4 cause i think a couple of the songs could have been better, but overall, it's great. This album is definitely different than Justified but it's still really good. So give it a shot, if you don't like the ENTIRE album, you'll like most of it chances are...
B00003CX8V|5.0|I loved Shirley MacLaine in those days, and it is because she was lovely at all, and this movie shows her charm well.  Costarring with her and Jack Lemmon gives a good result.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I think this was done very well. A lot of people don't seem to understand the point of this. It wasn't to replace the original Spector album, nor was it to give us an exact picture of what The Beatles originally intended the album to sound like. It's obviously revisionism, since it's after the fact and digital technology exists now that did not exist in 1970. However, what it does is give us as close to a commercial Beatles-sounding version of the Get Back tapes as possible. Something which both Glyn Johns and Phil Spector did not do. Johns made an album that sounded horribly unfinished and a complete mess that did not deserve to be released. Spector went to the other extreme and made a well-polished commercial album and made a good album, doing what he was asked to do, but several of the tracks did not sound Beatlesque at all, and left the project in an even more confusing state. What Let It Be...Naked tries to do is to not make an album as the Beatles originally intended, since even they didn't know what they wanted. The fact of the matter was, though the material was very good their playing ability was very poor during that period, and specific editing had to be done to make both a commercial and Beatles-sounding album out of that mess. Remember, even early Beatles albums edited two or more takes of a song together on occasion because sometimes you just can't get a perfect take live and with minimal overdubbing, like the way The Beatles wanted to perform at the time. Does Spector's version of The Long And Winding Road sound like a much better song than Paul originally wanted it to sound like? Yes, but the intention of this album was to make it as polished and commercial as possible, without losing the feel of a Beatles album. Do some of the tracks sound almost the same as what was on the original album? Yes, but remember Phil Spector did leave some of the songs in their original form without over-producing them. So there would be no need to make those songs sounddifferent on this album, plus the sound quality of those songs sounds much better since the original Beatles albums STILL have not been remastered in 20 years! Getting this album is worth it just to hear better sounding mixes of those songs! I say a job well done.
B000QQH4YS|1.0|Washed out colors and an overall softness of the image had me scratching my head. Did previous editions look like this? And sure enough, the \\"Robocop Trilogy\\" boxset from a couple of years ago looks significantly better, even if there is a little edge enhancement visible in some scenes. Buyer beware.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|As a Vietnam era veteran and amateur historian this film provided an entirely new perspective on an important time in our national history. I would highly recommend it to all.
0385720920|5.0|I picked this up for amusing reading during my vacation this summer and I tore through it in only a couple of days.  It's easy reading, funny, but also deeply satirical.      However, if you don't like modernist literature, and you didn't enjoy Palahniuk's other books, you might get turned off by the style.    I personally felt the ending was a bit weak, but the overall story was so strong it makes up for it.  The scenarios are so unique and the relationships he creates are at once so real and so superficial, I just like this kind of writing.
0345494997|5.0|Having grown up in Western PA & toured Frank Wright's Falling Water several times, I was interested in learning more about his life.  I liked that this was a \\"fictional biography\\".  Well it was a fabulous book - one that I hated to have it come to an end.    All I will say is that the author really draws you into the characters and you get a sense of their personalities, dreams and life back in the early twentieth century.  I came away wanting to read another biography about Frank Lloyd Wright and to tour more of his homes that he built.  He really was a genius if you have ever seen his work.  Buy it & read it - you won't regret it.  It's the kind of book you will be thinking about long after it ends.
B0000A118M|5.0|For someone who doesn't usually listen to Jazz, this recording embodies the highest ideals jazz sets for itself.  Great, virtuoso performances with a lot of soul and love.
B000IZJZLM|4.0|While the offering on this CD is more of the same of Il Divo's gorgeous sound, Siempre is just a little on the dull side for me. Except for Somewhere, the song from Don Juan DeMarco, and the extra live version of Unchained Melody (also on Il Divo album, not live), none of the other songs really pop for me and I find my attention drifting from listening to them with this CD. Usually their voices actually grab my attention and I can't help but sit down and just enjoy. It's almost like they went on auto pilot with this one.<br /><br />That being said, they still have a great sound and I love that they sing pop songs in other languages. I would probably not be into them if they sang everything in English, even with their beautiful voices. And Carlos and David's voices blow me away. I would listen to them babble even. I would say this CD is definitely not on par with Il Divo, and Ancora, or even their Christmas album, which I absolutely love, but it still showcases their voices, which is the main thing.<br /><br />There is also the live version of Heroe on this CD, which is on the Ancora album,but not live.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|I was really surprised by this album. I know that Kanye is an amazing producer but I've always been a bit indecisive about his credible rap skills.  Neverthless, Kanye produces magic in this album that can entertain even an anti-pop rap fan such as myself.  Graduation produces exciting beats, that are at times uptempo, soulful and lyrics that are not necessarily top-notch, but sincere, clever and at times amusing such as in the track Drunk and Hot Girls.  Some tracks are admittingly boring, but overall this album shines and Kanye proves that he can taking rap into new places that he didn't necessarily do in the efforts of his past albums.      Kanye has really grown in this third album, and has produced an album which holds strong until the end and which you can play from start-to-finish. Much respect and love to Kanye.  He also has done some great things with Common and it is perhaps his collaboration with this veteran that has inspired him to create this meaningful album.    Don't hate, drop this album.  Kanye has taken this album seriously and you won't be dissappointed.    Standout Tracks:     Stronger  Everything I Am   The Glory
B000002AH7|4.0|Since my interest in jazz is very limited, I felt it was only fair to write some comments on the album, rather then call this a review because I am sure that I am missing something that makes me have a hard time understanding this album. OK, my Miles Davis collection consist of only \\"Kind of Blue\\" which is an amazing piece of work. I also have some albums on which Miles is jamming with other muscians. I felt that I give \\"Sketches of Spain\\" a whirl, and even though I can understand the complexity it must have took to put this album together, it just doesnt quite have the vibe that I was looking for. I have listening to it over and over, and even though it is growing on me, I find it to be a difficult listen as it is really laid back. I am more into \\"Busy\\" jazz, and this is a very slow album. Its almost has more of a classical music type of vibe, and it feels more in that direction, then it does Miles Davis. In other words, I feel that Miles is more background with most of the works, since he is of course, playing with a symphoney. I would only rate it as just average for now, but I gave it an extra star just for the quality of musicanship on the album. SO my only advice is really for the those new to jazz or a casual jazz fan. I would start with \\"Kind of Blue\\" and then work my way around Miles stuff from the 60's. Then as you get into him more, try this out. YOu might like it. I admit its still growing on me, but it seems like a difficult listen.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|Framing Armageddon is a pure masterpiece. Schaffer has blown me away on this one. The storyline is very interesting, told very well, both with the music and the art work. Tim Owens never sounded so good, he fits Iced Earth perfectly. Owens is one of the best vocalist of all time and he just proved with this album. Don't skip this album. Best Iced Earth so far.
B000002G0P|4.0|Extreme might have dug a huge hole for themselves, as did some other hair bands (Queensryce also comes to mind) of the 80's and early 90's by writing cheesy pop metal tunes and love ballads that found themselves on every FM radios rotation during the time. Really known for Hole-Hearted and More then Words, Extreme proves with \\"Three Sides to Every Story\\" that they can actually play intelligent and some progressive rock tunes. After a questionable debut, and a very pop orientated \\"Extreme II\\",(which was good, but it was more just silly pop rock sort of like some Kiss) \\"Three Sides\\" moves away from the cheese and gets down to some more intelligent and progressive rock. Its a good thing to, since Nuno is a great guitar player and vastly under-rated, and I have always loved Gary's vocal. Even though Extreme would fade into the sunset after one last effort after this, for the price of under 50 cents, its a good pickup for rock fans, espically if you are a fan of Van Halen or you like more modern progessive rock such as Dream Theater.
0743454537|1.0|I felt like I was watching a \\"disease of the week\\" television movie.  Picoult takes what is a pretty compelling question and turns it into nothing.  The characters are flat, contrived and not believable; the ending is stunningly cheap.  Picoult spent the whole book setting up this conflict and then ran away from it. What a joke.  This is the first book of Picoult's that I have read and it will be the last.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.    This is the only book my book group has read that every one of us hated.
0743455967|5.0|On Writing, A Memoir of the Craft made me want to read or re-read everything ever written by Stephen King.  In my case that is a huge statement considering, the last book I read by King was Pet Sematary published in 1983. After reading On Writing, I discovered that King is a writer's writer.  King, one of America's most prolific popular writers, enjoys his craft.  On Writing is an easy-to-read handbook for writers. The first part of the book details King's childhood with his mom and older brother. This autobiographical section provides a glimpse into the events that shaped King's writing life. Fans of King will enjoy this section for its familial details; writers will be intrigued by the young King's sense of isolation and vivid imagination.   The second half of the book gives a nuts-and-bolts approach to writing that could be incorporated by anyone wanting to improve their writing. Rather than waste the reader's time writing just another book on grammar, King urges his readers to purchase the Strunk and White book, Elements of Style. According to King, one of the goals of every writer is to strive for improvement in their writing by understanding Strunk and White's grammar rules.  Although King says it is difficult to make a bad writer significantly better; he thinks good writers can become better by adopting some of his theories on writing such as avoiding the overuse of adverbs. He stresses that a writer will never become a good writer until they become a voracious reader. According to King, good writers take the time to write by concentrating on their work and shutting off the world by going to their \\"writing place.\\" He says he writes an average of 2,000 words a day.  At the end of the book, readers are treated to King's eclectic list of books he read during the creation of The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Hearts in Atlantis, From a Buick Eight and On Writing. He cautions that his list is just his personal preferences. He says he's not Oprah and this is not a bookclub.
B000N3SSVM|4.0|Some musicians just aren't cut out for the live performance. If you're a fan of Silent Shout itself, then this 3 disc edition is the definitive edition, but not because of an exciting live audio disc. The DVD is interesting and the original album is naturally a 5/5. The live audio disc could have been padded with some bonus tracks, etc. but instead it's a short disc with exactly the same audio as the DVD. Meh.
B000SVZIOY|5.0|The good looking guy next door that is quiet and just trying to get along, but has a secret. The thing is you understand him when he admits that he just doesn't get the rituals that seem to be required of living in the world with so called normals.  Then every once in a while you get that look of dark delight that says Dexter is going to get to play. The thing is, you really want him to, since when he does, another monster goes down. The last episode has a little fantasy, where everyone loves Dexter and celebrates what he has been doing. We really do wish in a way that there was a monster with values that would prey on the other monsters out there. The sad truth is that he would not be accepted any more than the monsters he preys on. He knows it too. What a great series. I wish that I had read the book first.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Grindhouse is an amazing film. I was one of the people who saw the movie as a double feature, and to me, it is one of the best fims of the year. However, I was hoping that the trailers would be included in the DVD's, but apparently not. Oh well, I guess I will wait until it becomes either a DVD Bundle, which (SHOULD!!!!) include the fake trailers, or the HD set, because the trailers will more than likely be included!

B000RG1FMO|5.0|From the colorful album cover to the incredible music that lays inside on the cd, all I can say in my opinion is simply amazing! I was always a huge Kanye fan but even this CD took me back a bit. Lets face it, College Drop out was a classic but I truly believe this album is up there side by side with it. His lyrics have matured in a huge way. These songs are inspirational and all about positivity. No killings, no shootings, no money, no cars, just about life. He speaks the truth. Okay so he might be a bit cocky but you know what?  He deserves to be. He talks a lot of $hit but he also backs it up every time an album drops. His production is always amazing with his unique sound and style. This is a new wave of hiphop. It's about time someone brought it back to where it all started from! Good positive music! Pick this album up you won't be disappointed!
068983571X|5.0|I have read and enjoyed many a good Sherlock Holmes story (e.g. \\"The Red-Headed League\\" is a winner), but at the very top of the book stack I would place \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\".  Who could ever forget the atmosphere that Arthur Conan Doyle evokes by his use of those misty moors!<br /><br />In teaching English (Literature) to a class of 7th & 8th grade boys, I was at first a bit hesitant to introduce this novel as our text.  Would a group of squirrelly junior high boys find anything of interest in a book written in 1901?  Answer:  I needn't have worried.  They loved it (and so did I)!  The fog from the moors drifted right into our classroom.<br /><br />First-rate mystery tale with one of the most famous fictional characters ever created.  ENJOY!  (But keep an eye out for a frightful luminescent hound next time you're walking home at night - just in case).

B00005AG7K|5.0|Magical Mystery Tour is a superb, mostly surrealistic film produced by The Beatles. Magical Mystery Tour employs all sorts of technological tricks, fantasy and reality to produce an appealing motion picture that you won't forget anytime soon--it's THAT good. The DVD is a print copied from film taken several decades ago, so prepare yourself for a DVD experience that's not exactly digital. The film works well anyway.<br /><br />The film opens with Ringo and his Aunt Jessie getting onto the Magical Mystery Tour bus--late, after just about everybody has boarded. Ringo and his Aunt Jessie ham it up big time with petty arguments that are rather well acted by the both of them. We are introduced to Wendy, the attractive tour guide and another gentleman who also guides the tour. Alf, the driver, is present only in name.<br /><br />The tour gets underway--and that's when the \\"magic\\" begins. We are guided through the English countryside, seeing it in multiple colors and hues just as one might if they were stoned on some drug. We also see the tour guides gently poking fun at more traditional tours by pointing out to the tourists some old ruins from ancient times that, of course, are impossible to see no matter how hard you look.<br /><br />Along the way the action gets accompanied by the songs of the Magical Mystery Tour record album; this music provides an excellent accompaniment to the fantasy and \\"magical\\" experiences. Look for Aunt Jessie to be served spaghetti by John Lennon dressed as an Italian waiter; and there's a scene in which the members of the tour disembark and crawl through a tent tunnel that leads them into a movie theater! I was reminded of the genius of the film Being John Malkovich when I watched this part of the movie.<br /><br />There are also a few segments of the film that simply feature the band as themselves; look for an excellent performance of \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" closer to the end of the film.<br /><br />It's also interesting to note that on the tour there seem to be no boundaries about who may participate: we see persons young and old, slender and heavyset, short and tall. We also see nutty characters like Mr. Bloodvessel and more mainstream types including the male tour guide.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is an impressive fantasy journey through time and space without limits. Many scenes are surrealistic; and they work well to bolster the film. The plot is razor thin but you'll never notice because the film is so much fun to watch.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film for Beatles fans; and people who enjoy surrealistic art will appreciate this film as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!m to be no boundaries about who may participate: we see persons young and old, slender and heavyset, short and tall.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|I can't say enough about how great Supernatural is.  I've never been so engrossed in a TV show before.  If you give the show a chance (get through the first half of Season 1) you will find yourself so involved with the main characters.  And Season 2 was just outstanding.
B0000024W3|4.0|I put off buying this album for many, many years after acquiring nearly the rest of his catalogue because of all the bad press it'd gotten (I didn't want to own another Down in the Groove). I finally bought it on sale out of curiosity and really liked it, for what it is. If anything, it's a mish-mash of pleasant recordings, sang in the same voice he used for Nashville Skyline. Not any of the tracks stand out, which helps to make it an album more tending to atmosphere, as many of his albums from 68-73 do. This is definitely not a stinker in the vein of his worst 80's stuff. If I'd gotten this album ten years ago, it probably would've confused my expectations and left a bad taste in my mouth, ala John Wesley Harding. Now I'm happy to say it ranks with his best output from this era.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Always been a Jane Austen fan and I bought this video on spec. What a find - a gem of a film so wonderfully crafted. Was glued to it and viewed it continuously at least 6 times [viewers may think me crazy] Bought a second DVD when first one started skipping scenes. the ending I thought was abrupt- so to satisfy myself I started on a sequel which turned out beautifully [Margaret's marriage - having twins-almost dying in the process, John's passion and steadfastness- Henry marrying but yet being Margaret's lifelong friend- his wife's death and John and Margaret bringing up his children, Mrs. Thornton's death, John unable to accept her death and gradual deterioration and death at 55 years. Childrens marriages, Margaret's love for the downtrodden enabling her to spend her monies on a hospital and school and finally Henry marrying her when she is 55 years and a widow, thus realising his one dream and making Margaret's life come full circle right to the beginning where Henry first proposed to her at 19 years of age[I jsut felt he deserved to win her affections at whatever time in his life] I concluded the sequel in 2 days as the story just kept un-rolling itself in front of my eyes.I was so obsessed with North and South.    I got the book only thereafter and noted that the first chapter had been deleted completely as is expected in films. If it had been included even minutely it would have given more substance to the film. Incorporating Richard's dilemma in leaving the Church and the need to escape humiliation etc and Maria's and Margaret's own desolation at leaving their beloved Helston. Also throughout the book John undergoes so much pain of mind, confusion and a sense of inadequacy in making his intentions clear to Margaret. The absence of sufficient scenes I feel deprived him of showing this side of him.  However, the silent brooding and unspoken words [ facial expressions did the job very well indeed] John's role as the overbearing master was perfect. I also preferred the ending in the book which appeared to be more realistic than the train scene. But all in all a truly remarkable and breathtaking film. Lovely themes and the music was superb with an equally stunning cast.  Each supporting the other, enabling them to give of their best. I enjoyed Richard Armitage's  interview . Such a charming actor [ no airs and graces- hope he retains this quality throughout his career] I would rate it 10. Hats off to the cast. I hope BBC will contemplate doing a sequel to North and South. This film deserves one and perhaps the time is right. The same cast, director, producer and all would do it more than justice, I am sure.     Viewing this film made me also purchase the novel Ruth and the DVD Wives and Daughters and I was truly fascinated by viewing \\" Who the Dickens was Elizabeth Gaskell \\"[ special features ] It confirmed my view of Mrs. Gaskell.  Only a person who has experienced all the feelings and trials of life or witnessing  these first hand, could write such novels which are so relevant to this century as well. More fact than fiction.    My advice to period lovers- Buy it -you wont know what you have missed until you have seen this wonderful drama.You are sure to watch it over and over again.   Finally, if anyone would like to edit or improve on my maiden attempt in penning a sequel may do so via Amazon.com if they have no objection .
B000TEUSJU|3.0|Tinto Brass' Caligula is a film with balls; both literally and figuratively. Loaded with over-the-top set design and egregious nudity, Caligula is often unfairly brushed off as an expensive porn flick. In fact, what seems agregious to us now might not even be a slight exaggeration as regards the Roman Empire in the early AD's. Apparently, this film is one of the more realistic accounts of the debauchery of the time. Indeed, the marketing does not shy away from this. The tagline read something along the lines of: \\"The only film to show the true side of Ancient Rome!\\" If the film's content is any indication, I would think so!    Caligula has 'cult' written all over it (as well as other 'c' words). This is not a great film, but it IS a great movie. Perfect to pop in in the middle of the night if you are bored, intoxicated, or both. As far as escapist fare goes, Caligula goes well. With the midnight-show dress-up aficionados, it would be just plain fun. Perhaps even a double feature with Rocky Horror?     The sets are outrageous but that's the point. Malcolm McDowell's acting job is surprisingly good, if a bit over the top (but who said that's a bad thing?). Peter O'Toole puts in a decent (albeit short-lived) performance as Tiberius.     My biggest qualm, however, with Caligula is the editing. The hardcore scenes are more than unnecessary and the fluidity of scenes and scene changes is almost incomprehensible at times. Blame Guccione for this; he locked Brass out of the editing room.     Overall I could not give Caligula anything higher than 3 stars out of 5, although I sometimes wish I could. 4 stars is 'Blow-Up' and 'Dirty Harry' territory, and I would feel uncomfortable having them share the glory with such infamy.     ***/*****   Fun, over-the-top, visually stimulating (among other things), a good conversation piece, and a great time-capsule artifact.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies I own, the DVD is the [[ASIN:B000059MEK Discovery]] album set to animation with a really good story to go along with it. The entire movie just uses Daft Punks music there is no dialog or any other kind of music. The story, for the most part, is easy to understand if you just watch the movie from start to end. This really is a great buy if you're a fan of Daft Punk. To be honest I put this DVD on almost every night, it's great to watch and if you fall asleep you still have the great music of Daft Punk
B00004TKAQ|5.0|BUY THE IMPORT remix VERSION ONLY from Eroc at the Ranch if you can find it.<br />&lt;ASIN: B00004TKAQ><br /><br />\\"...they were great. Quicksilver, the Airplane, Big Brother and the Dead were sort of the Big Four, and I liked all of them....\\" Owsley.<br /><br /> QMS was THE San Gran group when Jefferson Airplane was still learning to play their instruments. Unfortunately, QMS feel apart when Dino Valenti and his huge ego got out of prison. And JA got better. This is their best record,# 189 on Rolling Stone's Top 500 Rock albums of all Time, if memory serves.<br /><br />QMS is a Dionysian experience. Cannot be rationally understood or explained.  Rumor has it the only way you can really experience it is with things now lost to the Sands of Time. Things from Bear, Augustus Owsley Stanley: California Sunshine, Blue Cheer, Psychloglobin, etc. Improvisational music is infinitely difficult to perform, the artists are creating in real time, not performing some simple set pre-rehearsed ditty. No QMS wasn't \\"stoned\\" when they did this. It would be impossible to play with this level of telepathic tightness while intoxicated. Very very few bands can do this and most that do are playing jazz. Cream comes to mind. QMS holds your attention in the palm or their hands for 50 minutes and never gets boring and never lets go (unlike other San Fran groups I could name). Only two acid blues and rock songs followed by the song Roy Rogers and Dale Evans used to close their early 50's TV show, \\"Happy Trails\\", to wake up the entranced hippies at the end. This is the REAL late 60's.<br /><br />The two top albums by Quicksilver Messenger Service are their self-titled first album and this live album. Both of these albums demonstrate the musicianship was far ahead of many better known \\"Summer of Love\\" San Francisco Bands. I had heard the Capitol LP and the other available Capitol CD pressing of this and was underwhelmed. Yeah it's simple Bo Diddley \\"shave-and-a-haircut,two-bits\\" melodies, but I couldn't see why people thought that much of it. I always preferred the songs on first album (QMS) and I still like the mostly original tunes esp. \\"Pride of Man\\", \\"Dino's Song\\" and \\"the Fool\\".<br /><br />But then I got this Repertoire Remix and it is just spectacular! Electrifying, WOW!! The depth and the three-dimensional image are really outstanding, jawdropping. I could see why people like it so much. The playing, esp dual-lead guitarists John Cipollina playing against Gary Duncan, is yes, telepathic. The bass goes down accurately into the first octave, (20-40hz) which one rarely hears on any CD, much less one nearly 40 years old. \\"EROC at the Ranch\\"- Whoever the remix/remastering people were, they really know their stuff. This import version contains 2 octaves deeper bass and one octave higher treble than the Capitol mix!<br /><br />Yes, they go on a tad too long in \\"Who do You Love\\" and interest flags a bit, but \\"Mona\\" and the subsequent variations on it are really perfection. On a good full-spectrum hi-fi, this album is a rare audiophile demo quality album! This CD makes the other, cheaper, better-selling non-import version, frankly, a waste of money.<br /><br />The Real authentic feeling of the Haight Ashbury, psychedelic, Summer of Love, live Golden Gate Park-type free concerts. Unfortunately Quicksilver never achieved these Olympian heights again, after the first two albums. With changes of personnel and the return of Dino Valenti, they changed from the premiere instumental band to mostly just another SanFran group with a vocalist.<br /><br />It sounds like an SACD demo-quality disc - it's that good! AN AUDIOPHILE DELIGHT! ONE OF THE BEST RECORDED LIVE ROCK CONCERTS OF ALL TIME.<br /><br /> Any \\"mixed reviews\\" of the EROC version, the best available, quite frankly stem from listening on low quality stereos incapable of accuately reproducing the deep bass on that CD. If it doesn't sound like this, if it sounds boomy or muddy, you may be experiencing bass doubling (cheaper speakers have a midbass, 60-80Hz, bass hump, with nothing below, to create the illusion of deep bass) or room-wall interaction. You also might consider an speaker upgrade. Next time you audition new speakers in a stereo store, take this disk with you. Make sure you turn OFF your tone controls or equalizer!<br /><br />As Matthew Sweet said about his classic album Girlfriend \\"Don't be afraid to turn it up LOUD!\\", at low volume, the sound and 3-D image tends to collapse into the speakers.ling (cheaper speakers have a midbass, 60-80Hz, bass hump, with nothing below, to create the illusion of deep bass) or room-wall interaction.

It`s a zone \\"0\\"; DTS 5.1.  _ Image: NTSC, with the format 16/9, I have a Faroudja treatment for image, it is thus a vision \\"of postcard\\" without chalk-lining that I have with the screen, quality is comparable with a successful Superbit, no defect compression, all plans are equal values, the distants ones like nears,  similar with all the cameras and the \\"travellings\\" of those.

I did not see such a beautiful image of concert much, being understood that there are lasers, but they do not obstruct of anything the image.  _ the sound: very hot, the subwoofer is well animated, but I have \\"to increase it a little\\", the instruments are well routed, reverberation of the room, that surprises !.  _ Artistically : This concert is less \\"philharmonic\\" that of Athens, more popular, here it is not negative. . Yanni is very relaxed, he's him which acts as leader while playing !, he kept some \\"sizes\\": the famous beater (drums) in the concert: \\"Live at the Acropolis\\", on keyboard the same musician of Asian origin as in Beijing in the concert \\"Tribute\\", then a \\"small Japanese woman\\" virtuoso of the violin, other musicians play with unknown instruments of me.

The \\"movements\\" are very tinted of Mediterranean music, here Yanni \\"raked broad\\", he said it in his concert. the maximum musicians of origins and different phylosophies, in a title - for example- is a fort beautiful moment of \\"Country music\\" etc. This concert is with being advised bus in more there is a strong complicity between the musicians. The back-singers do an excellent job !. the violoncellist him also in the concert of Beijing, still the concert \\"Tribute\\", made prowesses. In short, that good !.  _ Defect: too short concert, damage: approximately 78mn (running time), but there are surprises in bonus tracks..., starting from track 7, of the extracts in DTS! are present, which is rare bonus tracks.  _ Conclusion: I spent a very good music moment !.    Sorry for my bad English !.
0316067598|5.0|This is an exceptionally well written book. The author is a laconic, plain-spoken fellow, and his straightforward, low-on-the-adjectives-and-adverbs style make his description of Hell Week (the extreme test undergone by Navy Seals at the end of their training) and his unit's ordeal in Afghanistan utterly convincing and quite memorable. Indeed, the story of Mr. Luttrell's mission, his luck in avoiding capture, the extraordinary kindness of the Afghanis who gave him shelter and protection, the emotion at his being reunited with U.S. forces, and Mr. Luttrell's toughness -- and sense of honour -- at going back to the Middle East to finish up his enlistment makes one shake one's head in amazement. This reviewer has bought more copies of the book as gifts for friends, quite convinced that they will find it as gripping as he.

B000N6TYLW|3.0|So ends my favorite show on television!  Sad, sad, sad.  I am so going to miss the Lorelais!  Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel created two of the most delightful characters to ever grace any show.  They were warm, smart, funny, beautiful, and totally watchable and believable.  From the beginning, the Palladinos created a world filled with excentric, loving characters.  Who wouldn't want to live in Stars Hollow; have coffee at Luke's, get some cake at Westin's, or catch a show at the BWR?       So season seven was a bit of a disappointment, that's a fact.  Six years of building toward Luke and Lorelai finally finding happiness, only to have Lorelai wake up in Christopher's bed, marry Christopher, split with Christopher and there she is wondering if Luke still cares and Luke wondering if she still cares.  Still, they managed moments that flickered with the sparkle of the Palladino years, and at its worst, Gilmore Girls was still my favorite hour of television.       I just finished watching the rebroadcast of the final episode.  It was sad and touching and warm and ended almost perfectly.  I liked that Luke and Lorelai seem to have come to an understanding, I loved that Rory is off to be a reporter, I loved the town coming together for the farewell party, but one thing would have made the ending even better.  As the camera pans out from Luke's Diner in the final shot, and this is not in any way a criticism of Sam Phillip's wonderful music, wouldn't it have been perfect to end with Yo La Tengo doing \\"My Little Corner Of The World\\"?

B000QQFKYE|5.0|The three Boschian rabbit headed humans, who star in their own 50's era sitcom, mumble thru their non-seculars, as a blonde woman weeps profusely. Time passes, an unseen audience laughs at non-jokes by the rabbitmonsters on stage. And this is only the first five minutes of a three hour film, which has got to be the most bizarre cinematic experience this side of Un Chien Andalou. Actually, I kept thinking as I watched it, how much this film followed the interior character logic of Eraiserhead, where the lead character's insanity became the theme of the film. Along with that, the flashes of bright light, sudden blasts of loud industrial sounds and screams, distortions on faces turning them into hideous monsters far more frightening than Eraserhead's \\"BABY\\", and you have a challenge on your hands. Yes, it IS long. It IS demanding. Certainly, it isnt for everyone. Lynch has certain films which are quite linear, such as Elephant Man, Dune, The Straight Story and Blue Velvet. Each of those films are enjoyable, and fun for the whole family. (If your family is called \\"ADDAMS\\".) A couple of films are in the middle somewhere, like FIRE WALK WITH ME, or WILD AT HEART. But, the recent work of Lynch has certainly been on the Avant guarde side. Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway both leave people, especially on the first viewing, scratching their heads, wondering WHEN this character turned into THAT character, when THIS event happens in relationship to THAT even, and so on. However, the imagery and to the greatest extent the plot, was still realistic. There were no giant rabbits, distorted faces, backward voices, or other excessive oddities from Lynch's ERASERHEAD era. (or, INDUSTRIAL SYMPHONY #1, for you die-hard fans.) This film has just about everything you could EVER want, in a freaky spooky movie. After awhile, you literally give up following the film logically, and give yourself over to the logic of its nightmare plot. And if Surrealism was suppose to be the exploration thru art and cinema of the DREAM STATE, then of anything i've EVER seen, this movie truly behaves EXACTLY like a dream. You see yourself, then you turn into another person, but you know its still you. Suddenly scenes change without meaning or logic, and you always sense your own ego somewhere watching the action. (Laura Dern is in every shot, so apparently the WHOLE FILM is her dream, or her nightmare, except for about a 40 minute sequence, where the MAIN PLOT, that of the filming of a \\"haunted\\" movie by two actors is introduced.) However, Laura moves out of this idea of linear logic right from the beginning, when the \\"eastern European\\" new neighbor pops in on Laura-as-actress' old world castle like home. While having coffee, the older eastern european neighbor introduced EVERY ONE of the main themes of the film. A FILM, that contains horrible deaths, cheating on a husband, bizarre dialouge, disjointed time sequences, even certain time signatures, like 9:45, or Midnight, or it \\"being two days ago, or tomorrow, who can tell?\\" Basically, the conversation is unsettling for the actress Laura, who asks the old woman to leave. Still, the old neighbor continues to \\"clue us in\\" on what to expect. Eastern European languages, idenity changes, and finally, the neighbor points across the room to a sofa, and says, \\"Tomorrow you will be there, and find out your got the part in the film\\". THEN, while the actress is staring across the room, she sees herself the next day with her two friends, rejoicing over finding out she got the part. (The neighbor knew this somehow, with her odd transtemporal logic.) Also, the soundtrack is FANTASTIC, as it always is in Lynch's films. I am almost POSITIVE that Julie Cruise sings a couple of the songs. Some of the music is BY LYNCH, who also wrote and directed this behemoth. Hey, if you can enjoy Wim Wenders longer pieces, or the original Russian version of SOLARIS, then the three hours spent watching this film, wont seem taxing at all. Personally, Isuggest watching it late at night, alone, in the dark, in order to be slowly engulfed by the nightmare logic and terror. Some of the most horrifying memories I have, are of dreams that dont make any sense in the light of day, but under the twisted logic of dreams and the subconscous, literally cause me to wake up screaming. I know that personally, when the LAURA-movie character does something predestined yet shocking, and Lynch suddenly turns the faces into monsterous images, I screamed out loud in shock, and horror. Also, this is a LOUD film. Lynch still has that bite from his post punk days, woven into this esthetic. Still, i'd rent this somewhere and watch it first, before buying it, just in case this is too out there for you. Even a die hard fan is in for a surprise with this magnum opus. However, compaired to the trash cinema, part three this, part 8 that, remakes of this, etc that have dominated the american screens recently, I consider a film like this a godsend. ESPECIALLY during these times of lowered expectations americans have with everything they consume, including entertainment and art. Lynch has perfectly transfered the nightmare of modern life onto the screen, in a way I have not seen, for a long time.suggest watching it late at night, alone, in the dark, in order to be slowly engulfed by the nightmare logic and terror.

0393061310|5.0|Simply the most important history book I have ever read. In this Pulitzer Prize winning book, Diamond covers the history of the modern human over the last 13,000 years in a concise, eye-opening exploration of the ultimate causes of European domination of the planet from 1492 onward. This is a must read for any serious student of history. Diamond outlines convincing and easy to understand reasons why the racist view of history is baseless and shows how the environmental factors of the various continents profoundly impacted the course of human history. He ends the book arguing well that history must be considered every bit the science as epidemiology and paleontology are. Very impressive.

Alex McCandless lived the ultimate adventure before he set out to live off the land in the Alaskan back woods where he died of starvation. This is the psychological autopsy, if you will, of an eccentric and brilliant man who saw life a lot differently than most folks. I found the book to be inspirational in McCandless' demonstrated strength of will and daring to live his life according to his own convictions.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Silent except for a subtle musical background, the artwork and animation gives a wonderful illustration of a child's dream that his snowman would come alive.  Personally, I bought it as much to hear just the beautiful \\"Walking in the Air\\" song when the child is flying with his snowman, as for the entire movie.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|What can I say!!!  Iced Earth has returned to form with the release of this gem.  This is just as good as \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" It rocks from start to finish.  The storyline is great and the music flows well.  Ripper sounds great; much better than \\"The Glorious Burden\\".  As the another reviewer mentioned, I hope fans of Matt Barlow, who is one of the best metal singers out there along with Russell Allen and Jorn Lande, give this CD a chance.        My only complaint (as a guitarist only), which is for all IE albums/CDs, is a lack of a great lead guitarist.  Someone who can tear it up with melody,feel aggression/attitude, and flash.  I can live with that though especially with the great songs on this CD.  Framing Armageddon is on par with Symphony X's Paradise Lost as being one of the best metal CDs of the year. Cannot wait for the next one in 2008
B00005JPKE|5.0|Its not often that Hollywood makes a movie about soldiers experiencing a defeat.  Even more rare is a movie about enemy soldiers being defeated by the home forces; American soldiers.  Amazingly, it took Clint Eastwood to make such a movie.  Released late in 2006 as a companion of the other Eastwood movie, Flags of our Fathers, this is one of the best war movies this decade.  Set entirely on the island of Iwo Jima, it examines the defense and conquest of this island by the US military in 1944 as seen from the eyes of the Japanese defenders.  The Japanese soldiers are played by Japanese actors; which is exemplary, and their on-screen dialogue is Japanese, another plus of authenticity.

B000RG1FMO|5.0|I have listened to the cd once in my vehicle,but I have played the song \\"Stronger\\" at least a dozen times.Talk about a song with a hook,I'm hoping to re-mix this one and sell as a single.I liked Mr.West first cd better than his second but I love this one.
B000O178BY|4.0|In a surprisingly short time frame (for Reznor, that is), NIN manages to release an album before the last left the public conscious. That this is no throwaway cash-grab makes it all the more startling; this may actually be Reznor's most ambitious effort to date. It's a bleak concept album (but aren't almost all concept albums essentially grim?) examining a not-too-distant future world, a frightening police state controlled by religious oppression and terrorism. But isn't the entire conceit inherently unnecessary? After all, while there are certainly landscape and structural changes between this future and the actual present, the topics of contention are as timely and accented now as then. Why not simply write about the disastrous state of these subjects here and now?    But Nine Inch Nails was always about the music more than the words; as much as I love Trent, he's been responsible for some pretty lame lyrical rants and overwrought \\"metaphors\\" in the past. The music of Year Zero pushes in both directions of Reznor's grasp. There is tender beauty emphasized beneath the pulsing beats and he presses the industrial aesthetic to the breaking points at a few junctures. So while it is often catchy and/or thrilling to the senses, it is almost just as often eardrum splitting. The \\"pure\\" industrial artists always snarled and mocked in his direction, but most either didn't get it or they didn't try; either way, they're not fit for much appreciation. But here, Reznor parts that Red Sea between melodic hook and saturated clamor, finding enough good moments in between but only sporadically delivering work to match his best from earlier years.    Much has been made of the external forces at play with the album release. The online advertising campaign, artwork, intricate interactive mysteries and alternate reality game (you read that right) makes more of the material than anyone possibly could with the album alone (perhaps even more than Reznor ever considered, too). The album's focus shifts in a similar manner; while previous albums frequently centered on the self and the mental mutilation within, Year Zero turns its focus outward towards society. Oddly enough, the attraction reverses that trend--while he's had a plethora of heavy, dance-friendly hits in the past, this album delivers very few that have a legitimate chance of making a dent even on the Indie/Alternative charts. Heavy on mutated robotic percussion (but without the rust of his early 90s output) and cacophonous breakbeats, low on infectious hooks and mope-along choruses, if this is Reznor recasting himself for culthood after mainstream trends have passed him by, he mostly succeeds.    \\"Glorified G\\" is far and away the most radio-friendly and catchy number on here and pulses with an energy lacking in draining moments elsewhere. \\"The Beginning Is the End\\" survives a start that immediately makes one prepare for \\"My Sharona\\" and then ends too soon. \\"Me, I'm Not\\" sounds like one of his smoldering sex jams, but in the album concept, seems to pertain more to the military industrial complex. \\"My Violent Heart\\" churns menacingly during traditional NIN verses (Reznor even runs through his breathy spoken word tricks) and then explodes with dynamo house beats for the jarring choruses. And closer, \\"Zero-Sum,\\" rivals \\"Hurt\\" at times for Reznor's greatest brutally dark ballad finish. On the other hand, \\"Survivalism\\" is good but hardly a strong choice for first single (and its beat and texture are reminiscent of the far superior \\"The Hand That Feeds\\"), \\"The Great Destroyer\\" is digital hardcore noise for the sake of noise like the most clueless of industrial musicians in the late 80s/early 90s, and \\"The Warning\\" sounds like it should be in the dance club of the damned.    A fierce measurement of reach and ability may implore greater adoration, but it's too difficult to ignore the Nine Inch Nails of yesteryear. True, it may be unfair to compare new material with old, and there are still the pretentious hipsters out there that think that NIN is fit only for mopey teenagers that think that Good Charlotte is too quaint (seriously, who ARE these people?), but at least Trent seems to be looking forward now. Not quite enlightening but engrossing enough, ambition gave him the chance to deliver a stronger album than his modestly disappointing With Teeth; it also exposed the flaws in his songwriting and concept. It won't likely replace Spiral, Fragile or Machine, but nobody rocks the post-industrial style like the man who first brought it to the masses.    Best cuts: \\"Zero-Sum,\\" \\"Glorified G,\\" \\"Me, I'm Not,\\" \\"The Beginning of the End,\\" \\"Another Version of the Truth,\\" \\"My Violent Heart,\\" \\"The Good Soldier,\\" \\"The Greater Good,\\" \\"Meet Your Master,\\" \\"Survivalism,\\" \\"In This Twilight\\"
B0002IU988|3.0|Alter Bridge is what I consider to be a very ordinary rock band.  However, seeing as how rock music these days isn't exactly the same compared to the 70's, I will cut it some slack.  Some of the vocal melodies are actually really good, such as the one on \\"Open Your Eyes\\".  Other times, such as on \\"Down to my Last\\", the vocals *try* to be memorable, but in the end, a failed attempt at a vocal melody.    No, these guys aren't the band to bring back the spirit and the creativity of the 70's rock scene, but give them credit for at least having the talent to write a few decent vocal melodies and for having the energy that's usually associated with these kind of loud, power pop \\"rock\\" bands.  A Creed wannabe band?  Perhaps, but I guess there's worse things out there.  Commercial rock in every way.
B0000025KI|4.0|Bruce's sprawling double album is essentially two different albums crossed together. One features the same sort of edgy, personal and downbeat material that filled Darkness and Nebraska; the other is upbeat, fun and lighthearted fare meant for jukebox consumption. It's not much of a surprise that the former has the greater impact, even though the latter makes the album as a whole far more palatable for the easy audience. But the question remains: why not separate the two moods and release two albums instead of one? Maybe it would be less forgivable if there wasn't nearly as much great material here as sub-par filler. After all, how many double albums are flawless from start to finish?     Contains his first big hit in \\"Hungry Heart\\" (I'm as stunned as anyone that \\"Born to Run\\" wasn't a smash when first released), but the best tracks include the father-son ballad, \\"Independence,\\" the idealistic, best-of-both-worlds \\"Out in the Street,\\" and the somber and sober finale, \\"Wreck on the Highway,\\" which would foreshadow his work on Nebraska. The biggest tragedy remains \\"Drive All Night,\\" an inexplicably lumbering and inert epic. This isn't quintessential Springsteen, but it beats out any other so-called \\"heartland rock\\" of the era.    Best cuts: \\"Wreck on the Highway,\\" \\"Independence Day,\\" \\"Stolen Car,\\" \\"Out in the Street,\\" \\"The River,\\" \\"Point Blank,\\" \\"Two Hearts,\\" \\"Hungry Heart,\\" \\"Fade Away,\\" \\"I'm a Rocker,\\" \\"You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch),\\" \\"Sherry Darling\\"
B000000XK5|3.0|It's been a while since I played this CD, which was greeted with rave reviews on its first issue in 1986. Ella was then in her late sixties, by which time her voice was past its best, which manifests itself in what could be charitably described as a wide vibrato on sustained notes. Listening again, I'm reminded of her later tendency to take liberties with both tune and lyrics. That would be defensible if it improved upon the original, but that was always arguable in her case, and the facility did not improve with the passing years.     My copy carries a tracklist which adds up to under an hour of music, and nothing in the way of a liner note. These deficiencies are offset by Joe Pass's sympathetic accompaniment, which was for me the deciding factor in its purchase.
B0000025T6|4.0|It must have been considered an enormous risk for a big American rock star to release an album like this on a major label. Nebraska is well-known as being the album chosen in favor of a scrapped full-band sound; instead, solo guitar, harmonica and vocals are all that ever appears. Thematically, this is as dark, meditative and pessimistic as the Boss ever got. The music excels as a result; Born to Run aside, Bruce is usually at his best when he's personal and stripped-down. It's a challenging album, especially for those that only embrace the two Born albums, but is one of Bruce's best post-70s albums thanks to the spareness and raw, \\"live\\" sound of the recording.     The highpoints include the haunting title track, the similarly-themed country-ish ballad, \\"Johnny 99,\\" the almost hopeful closer, \\"Reason to Believe,\\" and the despairing single, \\"Atlantic City.\\" The rocking \\"Open All Night\\" is a decent song, but feels out of place on the album. Fans shouldn't miss this, but even those who are more ambivalent towards Springsteen should give it a chance too. It's thankfully very different than his next hit album.    Best cuts: \\"Nebraska,\\" \\"Reason to Believe,\\" \\"Atlantic City,\\" \\"Johnny 99,\\" \\"Mansion on the Hill,\\" \\"Highway Patrolman,\\" \\"State Trooper,\\" \\"Used Cars\\"
B000RG1FMO|3.0|After two amazing solid hip hop albums just recently released this year, Common's Finding Forever and Talib Kweli's Eardrum, (both in which had an appearance with Kanye) one could only look foward to the next big album. This album was Kanye's Graduation. Unfortunately, this album was a mixed bag for me. As a producer, Kanye is one of the greats and he undeniably will be one of the best for some time to come. As a lyricist, I was definitely disappointed. Kanye is still better then most, but for this album I felt he didn't bring his A game. After hearing Common's and Talib Kweli's albums, this one seem very lackluster in the lyrical department. Either way, this is easily one of the best hip hop albums this year surpassing 50's Curtis.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|The third album for the Strokes didn't arrive with a lot of fanfare (it was dumped in the post-holiday wasteland where no group ever releases a big album), and perhaps that's fitting. Room on Fire wasn't a big disappointment by any stretch, but in 2002, they were still the most hyped rock band in the world. In early 2006, hardly anyone talked about them anymore. First Impressions of Earth contains neither the energy, consistency, nor that strange \\"avant-accessibility\\" they do so well. This is just...a rock record. That's it. More divergent, less enthusiastic, more streamlined, less pigeonholed. It is what it is. Someone could even ask, \\"Is this it?\\" The hype machine hit a bump in the road and died.     Unfortunately, that also means there's no longer a reason to adore these guys. It's their most uneven record to date, and it lacks a good number of standout tracks, and it's too long (it's almost as long as their first two albums put together). Lowered expectations help a lot, it seems, because I liked it more than Room on Fire. Even the songs that start out promisingly before eventually failing like \\"Ask Me Anything\\" and \\"15 Minutes\\" are more interesting than a band rehashing the same thing all over again. Maybe that's why this whole mess works: at least they're trying to do something different.    Best cuts: \\"Razorblade,\\" \\"Vision of Division,\\" \\"You Only Live Once,\\" \\"Juicebox,\\" `Size of the World,\\" \\"Fear of Sleep,\\" \\"Red Light,\\" \\"Killing Lies,\\" \\"Evening Sun\\"
0684135051|5.0|EZ's writing is exquisite, entertaining, an easy to understand. I love how you are actually thinking about what you are doing when working with her, not just following a laid out pattern. My knitting and the way I look at it is on another level after reading this book and putting it's suggestions into practice.
B000FWHVKA|4.0|What a difference two years makes, it seems. The Knife's last album was so overwhelming and uneven that one had to wonder if they were nothing more than a sub-par singles group. But with Silent Shout they prove they're capable of producing consistent albums and dominating the genre not with overplayed pop hooks but dark and atmospheric soundscapes punctuated by sharp bursts of light.     True, the album does have a few losers along the way (the overcooked and cartoonish \\"One Hit,\\" the shrugworthy \\"Na Na Na,\\" and the rhythmically-challenged \\"From Off to On\\") but even these lesser moments fit in so naturally with the rest of the album that it's difficult to think of a truly good reason to skip them. Meanwhile, \\"Marble House\\" shows a new direction for the band while \\"Neverland\\" sounds like a possible leftover from Deep Cuts, a sibling to their catchy hit, \\"Heartbeats,\\" but with greater purpose and a stronger dynamic within the current mix. Even the iffy early single, \\"We Share Out Mother's Health,\\" emerges as a surprisingly solid moment. They still have work to do, but suddenly the Knife shows promise where they once only showed missed opportunity.    Best cuts: \\"Marble House,\\" \\"Neverland,\\" \\"Forest Families,\\" \\"Like a Pen,\\" \\"Silent Shout,\\" \\"Still Light,\\" \\"We Share Our Mother's Health,\\" \\"The Captain\\"
B000RG1FMO|1.0|or else it would be \\"-5 stars\\". This cd is ridiculously disappointing. I only half way like TWO of the songs. I should have spent my money on the 50 cd instead. This cd made me not like Kanye anymore.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|One of the biggest problems with RCHP albums is that they overstay their welcome (several cross the hour mark by a decent margin) when they're usually at their best in smaller doses. So what a near-disastrous mistake it is for them to release a double album, each side far longer than they had any right to be. As a result, about half the tracks (therefore making up about one whole album!) sound too much like filler or worse and should have been scrapped to begin with. All the same, it's still RHCP, and they're too good to completely blow it, and the other \\"half\\" of the recording is often quite good.     \\"Dani California\\" is a solid starter, if a bit weak for the first single; \\"Tell Me Baby\\" is no better. The ballad-ish tracks are a mixed bag as expected. Most disappointing is the lack of good funky numbers, most notably the borderline embarrassing \\"Hump De Bump\\" (I realize that funk isn't expected to have lucid lyric writing, but come on!). The ones that traverse the middle road are the most frequently successful, in no small part to the often obvious contribution by Frusciante, who is quickly becoming the most intriguing musician in the group (sorry, Flea).    Best cuts: \\"Hard to Concentrate,\\" \\"Animal Bar,\\" \\"Especially in Michigan,\\" \\"Stadium Arcadium,\\" \\"Slow Cheetah,\\" \\"Dani California,\\" \\"Snow (Hey Oh),\\" \\"Readymade,\\" \\"Torture Me,\\" \\"Strip My Mind,\\" \\"C'mon Girl,\\" \\"If,\\" \\"Tell Me Baby\\"
B000SNUMC0|5.0|This album, right from the beginning, feels like it belongs no other place than within the Iced Earth catalog.  Jon Schaffer clearly poured his heart and soul into creating this album and every second of it shows.  The time it took to create this album was completely worth waiting for. The guitar work is exactly what Iced Earth fans have come to expect from this band.  The music truly fits with the lyrics, which are both entertaining and very well written.  The story is one that actually makes you want to take the time to understand it.  As if the single Ten Thousand Strong was not good enough already, when heard along with the rest of the album in its proper order, becomes so much better than it ever was before.  Tim Owens' vocals are top notch, there are quite a few interesting ways in which they have been layered and thus give things a very fresh sound.  The places in which these effects are done have been picked extremely well so that the proper lines are given the emphasis they deserve.  The drumming on this album is very solid and easily stands out as one of the better features of this album.  It makes me wish Brent Smedley had played on every previous album as well.    I expect there to be a large number of people who won't even give this album the chance it deserves simply because Matt Barlow is not singing on it.  However I think that anyone who honestly gives this album a listen from start to finish will come to the conclusion that it is easily one of the better albums to come from this band since its beginning, if not the best.  I have very high hopes for its sequel.
B00004XQP4|2.0|They showed an adventurous side on Nimrod, but Billie Joe Armstrong must have plum lost his mind before recording Warning. There are few hints of acoustica ballads, surf rock, lo-fi ska, or anything else like that on Warning. Instead, they slow things down and craft a series of pop songs with only the vaguest whiff of punk. It is important to note that this is not necessarily a bad thing; in fact, for a band that always considered melody over growl, it could have been a great thing.     Unfortunately, most of the album is as repetitive and droning as their earlier song, \\"Redundant.\\" The closest they come to their old sound is \\"Jackass,\\" an instantly forgettable filler track that incorporates an entirely unnecessary saxophone line in the bridge. Even when a little twitch appears, like on \\"Misery,\\" the welcome doesn't last long, and it only makes one wish it had been done by a braver band. That they would try this makes Green Day seem brave; that they would fail just makes them, well, Green Day.     They made the claim that any one of these songs could become a hit single; instead, none of them became big hits, the album was criticized, ignored and then disappeared. Most barely even remember they released an album between the MOR hit, \\"Good Riddance\\" and that \\"crazy punk opera\\" of theirs. Four or five tracks on here are worth remembering, but even they pale in comparison to most others in the band's catalog. When Green Day is good, they can be electrifying; when they stumble and fall...ouch.    Best cuts: \\"Macy's Day Parade,\\" \\"Minority,\\" \\"Misery,\\" \\"Dead Beat Holiday,\\" \\"Warning\\"
0689865384|5.0|As a 28-year-old, I didn't expect to find this book as enthralling as it was - the title lacks subtlety, and I figured that a book meant for teens might not be complex enough to truly draw me in and make me think. Not so! This is one of the most enjoyable reads I have had all year.<br /><br />Tally is an \\"ugly\\", a person under 16 in this society where people are turned \\"pretty\\" on their 16th birthday. Uglies, AKA adolescents, live separately from their parents in this world, existing in a loosely-controlled boarding school where they are relatively free to break out at nights and explore on their hoverboards.<br /><br />When Tally's best friend Peris becomes a pretty, Tally is hurt that she doesn't hear a word from him, and takes up a friendship with Shay, a rebellious young woman who questions whether she even wants to be pretty, a subversive and rare quality. When Shay decides to escape to \\"The Smoke\\", the deeply hidden rebel community where nobody turns pretty, Tally is forced by her government into deciding whether she wants to betray her new best friend and the community, or whether she wants to live her entire life stuck inside pretty town, but forever ugly and forever shunned.<br /><br />What happens next is the real story.<br /><br />This was a fast-paced, thought-provoking book that was a pleasure to read. I couldn't wait to get home each day to dive back in, and halfway through I knew I had to order the other two in the trilogy so that I wouldn't have to wait after finishing this first one.<br /><br />Give this a try.
B000092ZYX|3.0|At this point, there's no real worth in discussing the highs and lows of each new Radiohead album. Fans and critics are going to adore it, everyone else will simply turn their nose. A new Radiohead album is an excuse to roll out the red carpet for the doorway to masterpiece alley. Thom Yorke and company can do no wrong as far as they're concerned. I wonder if anyone even listens to these records before starting on the review. Quick, what's a synonym of `brilliant?'     Hail to the Thief finds Radiohead essentially treading water, offering a mash-up of their old sounds in one big collective. Unfortunately, it's not nearly as sweet going down the second time. Of the lot, only \\"Myxomatosis\\" can stand with the twenty or so best Radiohead tracks before this. The rest ranges from solid/good to merely okay. Thief is far limper than their other recent albums, struggling for an identity, almost afraid to present a new voice. Of course, that sounds worse than it is. Radiohead is always dependable, and even if this is the least successful LP in their catalog, it's a catalog that never stumbles too badly. Plus, fans and critics will no doubt love it.    Best cuts: \\"Myxomatosis,\\" \\"Where I End You Begin,\\" \\"There There,\\" \\"A Punchup At a Wedding,\\" \\"Sit Down, Stand Up,\\" \\"Sail to the Moon,\\" \\"2 + 2 = 5\\"
B000066C1N|5.0|When we bought the DVD for our daughter, first thing that jumped out was how incredible the music was. If you like Bryan Adams you will love this regardless if you have even seen the movie.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|It would appear that Come On Feel the Illinoise would be more aggravating than wondrous from the outset. For one, it came with a blitzkrieg of tearfully joyous reviews as if it was the greatest thing in alternative music, and who wants to hear that? For another, many of the song titles absolutely reek of pretentiousness, often existing more as run-on sentences than anything else (a nineteen second interlude called \\"A Conjunction of Drones Simulating the Way in Which Sufjan Stevens Has an Existential Crisis in the Great Godfrey Maze?!\\").     So it is with some surprise that it is one of the more thrilling, evocative, playful and beautiful records of the year. It's layered simplicity rings of the modern swells from the likes of Arcade Fire and Broken Social Scene, but the key is in the storytelling. It's strong enough on the first listen when the lyrics frequently fade in the midst of the musical expression, but when the tales being told are examined, the experience becomes richer. If there is a lacking, it's that at seventy minutes and twenty-two tracks, there's really only about forty-five minutes of true songs on here; the rest are intros, interludes, overtures and the like. Does it enhance the record? Sure. But is it really necessary? Probably not. But even though there aren't too many true standouts that will have you hitting repeat (except the amazing \\"Chicago\\" and the towering title track), it's designed as a complete experience, warts and all, and the facade of ostentation quickly melts away.    Best cuts: \\"Chicago,\\" \\"Come On! Feel the Illinoise!\\" \\"The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts,\\" \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\" \\"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back From the Dead!! Ahhhh!!\\" \\"Decatur, or, Round of Applause For Your Stepmother!\\" \\"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!\\" \\"The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulders,\\" \\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\"
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This DVD set came highly recommended and after watching it I think everyone should see it. If you can see it in HD it is even more of a must see. It will truely blow you away.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|It's nice to see Tweedy happy again. I guess he has a grip on things again. Good for him. Great effort. Not a stumble on the whole CD. Not the best Wilco, but 5 stars just the same.
B000I2J2WM|5.0|WoW! Great old movie in a new format. HD-DVD really shines in this release. The transfer to HD-DVD of this classic film is better than many new HD-DVD's. This was well filmed back in the day. The plot is a little thin and so is James Garner but the racing is first rate. Projected on to a large screen makes you feel like you are in the cars with the drivers. This movie is just COOL!
0316067598|5.0|This book offers such a rare and privileged look into the the scenarios and actions that navy seals face.

B000FZEQS2|5.0|Great performances in this film. Robert Redford gives his usual excellent performance. Brad Pitt is also excellent in this spy thriller. The transfer to dvd is very good unlike some I have. I thought is was well done with a good plot.     Buy it!

B000H6SXMY|5.0|Well, as it has been said, this is a MUST HAVE for all Friends fans. I just wanted to add to the review list some information I wanted to know before buying and I didn't find here (so I take a shot ordering :P)    1. This is the COMPLETE series, and this means the UNCUT version for each chapter... \\"with never before seen footage\\".     2. Somebody asked in another review about Spanish subtitles. YES, all chapters are subtitled, but none of the extras.
B000SFJWLU|4.0|A band that lives up to it's name? Five Finger Death Punch's music sure does a swift job of living up to such a bold statement. Clutching the listener upon impact, the band's proper debut, \\"The Way Of The Fist,\\" is a rollercoaster of a metal album that will appeal not only to the most cynical of metal-heads, but those who don't primarily pay attention to the genre as well. It's got something for everyone. Thanks to frontman Ivan Moody, who some may remember from a little band by the name of Motograter, we are treated to a voice in the genre that can pull off a limitless range of styles and push it forward with passion. Backing him up are an odd assortment of co-horts; hailing from the post-grunge band U.P.O., we have Zoltan Bathory on guitars, with bassist Matt Snell (formerly of Deadsett) and ex-W.A.S.P. (yes, you heard me, W.A.S.P.!) members Darrell Roberts (guitar) and Jeremy Spencer (drums) rounding out the line-up. Truly, it is their diverse backgrounds that come together to bring such a rich and unique sound. Not to mention that each member is in top form and puts on one tight performance. You can listen to this ten track CD thoroughly and everything blends seamlessly without letting up for a moment. To be honest, the only flaws are that they don't show off just how diverse they can be (first single \\"The Bleeding\\" stands alone) and in the end, the album is just too brief. Regardless, Five Finger Death Punch's sound is one that actually sounds modern, especially when placed in a wasteland where every other metal band emerging sounds alike. \\"The Way Of The Fist\\" is a satisfyingly addictive metal album that just about anyone can appreciate.
B00009W0U4|3.0|This film is ugly, brutal, depressing, visceral, and hopeless. The<br />first time I saw it, I was devastated. I reeled for days afterwards.<br />But seeing it a 2nd time, I didn't care for it as much, in fact, I feel<br />I've been had. Its impact is really felt the first time you see it,<br />because seeing it the 2nd time, you realise a lot of things about it<br />that aren't particularly good. Most of the dialogue is poor (most of it<br />was improvised, and not very well), the violence of the film is<br />purposely over the top, and Noe the director seems to delight in<br />showing nasty stuff without really bringing a sense of art to it. He<br />enjoys rubbing your face in the sleazy, horrific violence, but has no<br />purpose other than saying \\"life is brutal\\". I can't deny that the film<br />did have a great impact upon first viewing, but too often when one's<br />sense are assaulted (like they are here), you can mistake that for<br />great, artistic film-making.<br /><br />Technically, the film is astounding. It was shot mostly in long takes,<br />but edited together with CGI effects (the smashing of the head in the<br />gay bar at the beginning was done digitally, as part of the rape<br />scene). It's definitely a curiosity, but realise what you're getting<br />into. It's really not for the squeamish. The opening scene in the gay<br />bar is dizzying and brutal, and the rape scene is beyond brutal. Noe<br />films the rape scene in one take, which makes it even more difficult to<br />watch. Is the film art? No, it isn't. Simply because the film polarized<br />audiences doesn't make it art (a common assumption by people). Noe's<br />films (he's only complete 2 features) aren't really deep or anything,<br />just pessimistic and brutal.<br /><br />A telling episode about Noe happened a year or so ago. The IFC Theater<br />in NYC has a feature they do occasionally. They bring in a filmmaker to<br />introduce a film they admire. Noe showed his first film, I Stand Alone,<br />and Pasolini's Salo. After Noe's film concluded, he talked to the<br />audience on why he wanted to show Salo. All he talked about was the<br />coprophilia scenes (aka the s**t eating scenes). He didn't talk about<br />anything else that Salo had to offer (in terms of its message on<br />fascism, sexual perversion, the cinematography, the production design).<br />Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom is actually an excellent film. It's<br />incredibly depressing and brutal, but has a real sense of art and is a<br />genuinely controversial film, even to this day. Noe's films (he's made<br />only 2) are not like this at all. Both I Stand Alone and Irreversible<br />hit you in the face the first time you see them, but you shake it off,<br />and Noe has nothing more to give you. This film has no resonance at<br />all.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have enjoyed many older TV series, today I mostly turn off the TV when series comes on, but whenever Firefly is on, I will be late for work.  I cannot explain what captivates me so much, but Joss Whedon did an excellent job of character development and the casting was perfect.  Every show was serious, but in the serious moments, some of the best comedy came out.  Everyone who has borrowed my copy of this series has bought it for themselves.  I only hope that one day Serenity gets to fly again.
0060776579|5.0|This is an awesome read for anyone. It is especially poignant for those who know they have what it takes to make it big; but continue to not master whatever it is that they need to get there.  These ideas and concepts can be applied to life; not just creating wealth.  T. Harve Eker does a great job of relating to his audience in easy going everyday terminology.   I have been quoting this book since the very first day I listen to the CD. This is a well done first rate book; buy it for your Dad, your Mom, your Brother, Sister; anyone that you care about.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|I Won't Attempt to break down everything on this album b/c there is alot, but if you know Kanye, not much has changed in his beats formula when its comes to sampling so if you hate that, then it may not be for you. Otherwise, it is a solid enough beginning to end. This album's theme is very much uplifilting in its demeanor compared to the Graduation and has a balance of positive feels (i.e. I Wonder, Stronger, Champion) as well as the light hearted fell good one (i.e. Good Life, Drunk & Hot Girls) and the introspective ones (i.e. Big Brother, Can't Tell Me Nuthin).  The only thing I think that may be lacking is increased lyricism but its still better than most out.    Standout Tracks:  1.Good Morning(Intro)  5.Good Life  6.Can't Tell Me Nuthin  9.Flashing Lights  10.Everything I Am  13.Big Brother (Best Song)    Beats = B+  Lyrical Content = B  Artistic Growth = B-  Cohesiveness = A-  Overall = B+

B000K4WPCC|4.0|Far better than its own trailers made it look, \\"The Covenant\\" is actually a well-done, thoroughly fun and rewarding horror movie laced with fantasy elements.  Using the dark side of magic and a conflict between rival warlocks has made for a good, fresh film.       In the town of Ipswich, there are four young male warlocks, each a descendant of one of the five founding families of the little New England town from centuries ago.  In a bit of a novel twist, each of the four are possessed of near-limitless power (that's near-limitless by comparison with normal humans; presumably the warlocks don't reach the levels of, say, Gandalf from Lord Of The Rings or Dr. Strange from Marvel Comics) but can only use it in extremely small doses, because it rapidly affects its own wielder, causing them to age and basically rot from the inside out if used too often.  Basically the warlocks are the good guys, even if they are rather drunk on their own power, using small bursts of it to stage death-defying stunts to entertain themselves and to make themselves the coolest, most popular guys in their school.  They're even known as the 'Lords Of Ipswich' by their peers who have no knowledge of their supernatural attributes.  They run the gamut from pretty straight-laced to rebellious and a bit unlikable at first, but basically there's been no great conflict in the town.  Until a fifth warlock arrives on the scene, a descendant of the 'other' founding family, with very dark motivations.      Although a large part of the impetus behind \\"The Covenant\\" was apparantly to make a horror movie centered around a group of 'hot guys' for female horror fans (and some male fans) who've felt disappointed that in most horror movies all the shower scenes/etc. usually feature girls; heterosexual male fans (and some female fans) will be glad to know that the filmmakers didn't skimp on the 'babe factor' either, so there's some treats for everyone regardless in this one.  Even apart from the sexuality aspect, the whole film is very, very well presented visually, with high production values and quality special effects.  The magic-on-magic battles may draw a few fantasy fans into horror this time around, too.  Things like characterization and plot coherence are put together much better than I would have thought than from the rather uninspiring previews I'd seen.     One note: although the product info lists this DVD as Fullscreen 1.33 - 1, as far as I know only one version released has both the Fullscreen and the 2.35 - 1 Widescreen formats available on the disc.  So you're probably safe with this one if you're looking for Widescreen, but you can email Amazon and ask for verification if in doubt.    Another four-and-a-half star horror movie, and one that, in contrast to the definative, seemingly sequel-barring endings of a number of recent horror films, seems ripe for a follow-up.  Recommended.
B00004R9A4|1.0|I watched this movie countless times as a child, and loved it. I was excited to get it on DVD, but now that I have watched it I must say that I am very disappointed in this anniversary edition.     A very few of the extended scenes were useful or interesting, but for the most part redundant and disappointing. They slowed the pacing and diluted the storyline and character development. The editing itself seemed poorly done as well, changing the order of some scenes. All very unneccesary.    Most distressing of all, the sound on most of the added scenes was very poor, lips out of sync, and some of the dialogue appeared to have been dubbed in (badly) by some other, unknown actors! Perhaps this was a result of unusable original recordings, but it was extremely jarring and irksome. Even worse, some of the lines from the original release (often ones that flowed into a \\"new\\" scene) were also altered. This is COMPLETELY unacceptable. (Nearly as bad as another old classic, Darby O'Gill and the Little People; the DVD version of that one that I saw appeared to have had ALL of the leprechaun king's lines dubbed over, poorly!)    I wouldn't object to having this version as long as the REAL original was also included on the disc! Why can't they let the classics BE?!? I would MUCH rather have a worn old VHS (though I must admit that *visually* this edition was nicely restored) than be constantly distracted by terrible sound quality and bad editing.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|While not reaching the pinnacle of the first \\"Underworld\\", this sequel is a very worthy follow-up that attains its own kind of greatness.  Visually stunning, sexy, action-packed, and imaginative in the looks for its slowly growing line-up of creatures, it's a horror thrill ride that makes it worthwhile to overlook a few missteps.       Beginning about 800 years ago to reveal the full origin of both the vampire and Lycan (werewolf) clans, it then flashes forward to the present day, picking up very shortly after the ending of the first movie.  With the vampire hierachy shaken to its foundations and the clans in disarray, Selene and Michael are on the run from a slew of potential enemies, quickly hopping from safehouse to safehouse.  Marcus, the third of the elder vampires (and apparantly most dangerous, capable of shifting into an awesome monsterous form with massive, taloned wingtips that can impale his adversaries) is awakened and fills the role of main villain in the movie.  He pursues Selene because her position as the 'adopted daughter' of Viktor has, in a fashion that's explained later in the film, some kind of connection to an ancient plot that Marcus has been waiting centuries to put into play.  In the chaos following the first movie's finale, Marcus seizes on the opportunity to finally track down and free the original werewolf from its prison.      One thing wrong is that \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" feels too rushed; there's too much packed into its 106-minute running time.  What I really would like to see (and actually wouln't be surpised to see happen close to the release of a third Underworld movie, if one comes out) is a release of an Extended Edition - 25 or 30 minutes longer, ideally - of Underworld Evolution come out.  Close to half an hour is about what I figure it would take to balance the pacing and give it a chance to develop some points that felt shortened.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was originally longer anyway, and got cut down because studios are still shy about releasing very many theatrical movies that go much over two hours.      Another problem - and I hate to admit this one because I really loved \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" - is that there are a few parts that just plain don't make sense.  For example, after a major blow-out at a restaurant against Marcus, (where there's even a large police prescence) Selene and Michael flee the scene in a truck and end up taking refuge in an old warehouse that appears to be only a few miles from the site of the altercation.  Now, I realize dawn was breaking and they had to take any refuge available because Selene burns in sunlight.  But once there, they seem completely unconcerned that it might be easy for the police or anyone else to find where they'd holed up (or maybe not so easy, since no one does).  Instead the movie goes forward into more romantic territory very quickly at this point.  Now, that part was welcome, but if the film had been longer, there could have been a more realistic, 'cornered/on-guard' atmosphere where the two are trying to devise a way to get a better distance away in the daylight hours; and then had the exact same romantic scenes from the warehouse take place somewhere else, safer.  There are a couple other instances where things like this just don't seem consistent.       The acting, while good, isn't quite on par with the first one either, although there a number of truly impressive performances, including by Kate Beckinsale as Selene and by Derek Jacobi as a previously unseen Immortal from before the time of the first vampires and Lycans.  It's hard to compare Scott Speedman (Michael)'s performance with his great turn in the first one because he doesn't get as much screen time here; maybe they'll beef up his role in either the third film or an extended version of this one.  The action sequences are superb, and the special effects excellent.       If there is a third movie, I'll repeat what I said when I did a writeup for the first one:we've got new spins on vampires and werewolves here; I really think the filmmakers would do well to consider adding a third breed of monster (goblins, zombies, whatever) and trying to do something really fresh and original with them too.       Overall \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" is a great action horror movie, ones that fans of the first one can't afford to miss, even though it requires some suspension of disbelief.  Definately good enough to buy and not just rent.

0375831002|5.0|The Book Thief is one of the most beautifully written books that I have ever read. To me the most amazing part of this story is the way that it is both compelling and also written so beautifully that every sentence deserves to be read, and reread. If the Diary of anne Frank was memorable, this book is life changing. The most complex character is Death, the narrator himself. We see the publicized version of death, the grim, cruel and merciless \\"reaper.\\" But death is also shown in a rather humane way, he feels compelled to watch Liesel (The Book Thief) grow up and becomes nearly paternal to her. But Liesel's relationship with Max Vandenburg is made of the stuff of great novelists. To spoil a bit of the story, after leaving the Memingers, Max's next encounter with Liesel is when he is being marched to a Jewish detention center, and the scene that ensues is inarguably the most eloquently written narration that I have ever read. Everyone should be required to read this book. This is NOT a young adult story. The main character just happens to be a young adult. Please read this book
038572179X|5.0|I confess that the beginning required some effort. I confess that I was unsure how far I would go with it. I confess that I was rewarded for my patience. This was my first McEwan, but it won't be my last.     The Dunkirk retreat is worth the price of the book. I am anxious to see how the movie depicts this anti-war segment. If it's an anti-German and not an anti-war emphasis, I'll be disappointed.    McEwan's artistry is best evidenced in his answering of the questions, which the reader has collected as the story progresses. They are effortless revelations conversationally dispensed at appropriate, but not expected, moments.    Finally, consistent with the reality of modern prose, the heroes aren't, nor are the villains. They are just humans, existential beings, playing the hand that's dealt.     This is a terrific story told very well.
B000SLP4SE|2.0|This is an extremely boring action movie. There are a few good action scenes but nothing  you haven't seen before. Mark Wahlberg plays a sniper who shoots and kills people. Not exactly what you would call a sympathetic character. Wahlberg is set up by the Government to take the fall in an assassination. The problem is there is no character development and you simply don't care if Wahlberg's character lives or dies. The movie is devoid of drama and simply relies on the power of the action scenes to keep your attention; unfortunately, my attention was lost about a half hour into the movie. I give it another half hour then I gave it the gong.
B000RG1FMO|1.0|The most depressing thing about this album to me is the fact that people believe this is \\"real hip hop.\\" Not that it is my place to in any way decide what is categorized as \\"real\\" and what is not but for one to make that decision I believe they must have a wide perspective of the genre. I have been in rap production for several years and I understand that sampling is as much a part of modern hip hop as anything else but there is a fine line between a sample and a remix. I think Kanye's work on \\"The Blueprint\\" was some of the best producing in modern hip hop, and it is clear he has headed in a different direction from that. With that being said most people, even his biggest supporters, will agree Kanye is in the \\"lower end\\" of rappers when it comes to his lyricism. Not that everyone should sound like a carbon copy of Blackstar, but to me Lyricism means putting meaning behind what you say. So when I look at this CD all I really see is a collection of over the top beats and mediocre rhymes.    When alls said and done I believe this CD epitomizes the war cry of \\"hip hop is dead\\" because it shows fans with no perspective outside of what it thrown at them on MTV. If you like this CD that's great, I understand its catchy and easy to listen to, just please also listen to Illmatic by Nas, Reasonable Doubt by Jay Z, Ready to Die by Biggie or All Eyes on Me by Tupac before you grace this with five stars.

B00005JPAO|3.0|There is no doubt that Dame Helen Mirren deserves the Oscar Best Actress award. Her \\"portrayal\\" of Queen Elizabeth II gives viewers moments of illusion that she were the queen. But all we can really see is a snapshot of the royal family, because no one can possibly know their private thoughts and conversation behind closed doors. It may be interesting to contrast the royal family's reactions to the public pressure and scandals by looking at the past. [[ASIN:B000742G06 Edward & Mrs. Simpson]], a 5-star topnotch TV mini-series may provide that opportunity, and Actor Edward Fox's King Edward is as compelling as Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth.
B0004Z33EQ|2.0|The first movie was fantastic, but this lame second one was a real dissapointment.  I too saw this movie originally in the theaters when I was in the Army.  No one fires a LAW while inside of anything (even a building unless you have it well ventilated).  And you also make sure that the people you are trying to rescue aren't right behind it.  He would have killed everybody (other helicopter, his rescuees, and himself) had he really fired the missile.<br /><br />On top of that it also introduced a bunch of Russians into an era and situation that they had no reason to be in.  A much much better movie is \\"Uncommon Valor\\".<br /><br />It is too bad because this could have been a great sequel.

0345494997|4.0|Sometimes I struggle with the fact versus fiction issue. This book handles it superbly.In fact, I felt the author created such a vivid, flesh and blood character in Mamah, that the line between fact and fiction seems quite irrelevant. It really is Mamah's story and while Wright is a fascinating character, the author creates a sympathetic, yet flawed central figure who seems very true to life. Biographies, with lots of footnotes, struggle to bring to life the subject, and all biographers have to try to fill in the pieces between the facts, and the reality that even in a journal, a subject may color events and emotions to fit how they wish to be perceived.  It appears that there is not enough material available to hear Mamah in her own words and in lieu of that, I feel that Nancy Horan is a splendid biographer. She has taken the facts and woven them together with her own sensitive understanding of the condition of educated woman at the beginning of the nineteenth century to create a compelling portrait of a woman making difficult choices. It is a book that will stay with me a long time.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|Everyone's favorite high school detective is back at it, and maybe getting deeper than she should.<br /><br />There were a lot of questions for Veronica Mars heading into the second season. Will it be able to match the genius of the first season? How can the new 'big mystery' even compare to the one we saw in the first season? Among others. However, there were a lot of questions left hanging once last season ended so if you took the time to watch it there's no way you're not going to watch the second season if you're seeking answers.<br /><br />What are the big mysteries this season? Here's only a sneak-peak:<br />A bus crash.<br />A murder.<br />An unfolding drug ring.<br /><br />After a bit of a shaky first episode (there was A LOT of explaining to do which results in A LOT of flashbacks), everything else flows just as easily and perfectly as it did before. Veronica is still that sassy teen detective we all love. Wallace, thankfully, gets a much better and more detailed background. Keith continues his wonderful father role and digs his teeth into a couple juicy cases. Logan is still that 'love him or hate him' kind of guy, but we can start to understand why he is the way he is. Then there's Duncan. I'm still not big on him but he seems considerably less wooden this time around.<br /><br />Whether it's the mysteries that keep you coming back or it's the humor, just know that both those ingredients--and the seldom talked about intense emotional moments--are there in full force. Season two of Veronica Mars only solidifies why we love the show. Word of advice, prepare to be blown away by the season finale.<br /><br />Oh, and is it just me or is it completely hilarious how much Veronica wants a pony?

B000RJO578|4.0|The creative forces behind the comedic take on zombie flicks, \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" give us their interpretation of \\"every action movie ever made\\" with \\"Hot Fuzz.\\"  Fans of \\"Dead\\" will immediately notice headliner Simon Pegg as Nicholas Angel, a London policeman who's excellence in service forces his superiors to ship him to a small country town in order to protect their own reputations.  \\"Dead\\" fans will also recognize his bumbling sidekick played by Nick Frost.  The duo quickly find plenty of trouble in their normally quiet town.  A large number of \\"accidents\\" occur that peak the interest of supercop Angel.  As the body count grows, Angel's list of suspects gets even larger.  Who's causing the accidents?  What action film isn't referenced?  It's all here in this superb comedy.<br /><br />Edgar Wright's hard-cutting, musically driven direction style is all over this film.  Once again, fans of \\"Dead\\" will pick up on all of Wright's nuances as the story rolls along.  The action is fast, loud, and over-the-top.  It's also pretty gruesome and hilarious at the same time.  Pegg is dead on as Angel.  Despite his small stature you honestly believe that he's the ultimate police officer.  Frost is perfect as the local idiot who only has a job because his dad's the chief inspector.  The rest of the cast reads like a who's who of British film.  Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Billie Whitelaw are just a few of the actors you'll find (some with large roles and others with just a blink of the eye's screen time).  Each and every person in this film hams it up perfectly and appears to have had fun with the film.<br /><br />The action sequences are all pretty convincing.  Even the scenes that involve sweet old ladies packing automatic heat on a bicycle come off superbly.<br /><br />The DVD is nice.

B0002DRDBE|5.0|If a single day in the life of a small convenience store clerk seems like a good idea for a movie, you need to watch clerks. if it doesnt, then you need to watch it anyway. Clerks was Kevin Smiths first movie, but it takes place second in the timeline of the \\"New Jersey Cronicles\\" just a few days after the events of Mallrats.<br /><br />Clerks was filmed in black and white with a $27000 budget, but dont let that steer you away. the low budget adds some sense of charm to the movie i havent found in many others. the black and white adds a sense of artsiness to the cheap film style. its mostly a series of long conversations between the main character working at the quick stop randall next door at the video store. the conversations run everywhere from the contractors who built the Death Star to what they're going to do with the rest of their lives to a lot funny sex talk that has probably offended lots of people since its release.<br /><br />Jay and Silent Bob made their first appearance in Clerks and have consequently been in every othet movie of the cronicles (mallrats,chasing amy, dogma, jay and silent bob strike back, clerks 2)<br /><br />The Clerks X 3 disk DVD set is a great deal with TONS of bonus features. there is an hour and a half documentary of Kevin Smith's life leading up to the release of Clerks. There is a director's cut version of the film *SPOILER* where Dante actually gets shot and killed in the end. there's a lot of deleted scenes. there's 2 or 3 different commentaries for the movie. there's the original auditions from all the main characters.<br /><br />this is a great movie in a great collection full of special features.
B00006FDCD|5.0|The product I had ordered came to me in a very good packaged condition and it was within the estimated time of arrival. The product is of high quality and performace. It is really professional!! Keep the good show.. I will defenitely recommend to my friends.. Cheers to Amazon!!
B00005OM4K|5.0|The CCR box set gives you the complete recordings of this great band. It's not just a fantastic overview: it's the works: everything they recorded and with a great sound quality. I can now listen to all the albums in their entirity, not only on vinyl (which I have worn out), but on remastered cd's. Awesome!!
B00001OH7Y|2.0|Well, this is one of those albums.  The song in question is \\"Ashes to ashes,\\" an inventive and attractive sequel to \\"Space Oddity.\\"  Aside from that, this album is a self-indulgent mess.<br /><br />I think the basic problem is that Bowie had lost much of his interest in his craft at this time and the results show it:<br /><br />1) Lyrics: On track 3, there is a wonderful line \\"Scary monsters and superfreaks keep me running scared.\\"  Brilliant stuff.  Even if you are stoned all the time or not paying attention to the album (I suspect both are true of Bowie at this time), this line has to strike you as pretty weak - how about avoiding including both \\"scary\\" and \\"scared\\" - you know, try to tweak it and improve the words somehow?  No.  These exceptional lyrics are repeated three times in the song.<br /><br />2) Music: If I had to describe what the music on this album is like in words, I'd say that the songs consist of dance-type beats repeated over and over again with Bowie howling over it.  At this point in his career, Bowie simply couldn't sing any more.  His range is minimal, the tone is painfully ugly and he resorts to nearly shouting much of the time.  Ugh.  And the fact that the songs are mostly tedious and repetitive doesn't help.<br /><br />Basically, this album is just one big pose.  Bowie forgot why he was an interesting artist in the first place and didn't devote any serious work to making it.  All hype.<br /><br />I do think \\"Ashes to ashes\\" is a fine song and remains a favorite of mine.  It contains an interesting melody which is longer than the others on \\"Scary monsters\\", Bowie actually sings (although not particularly well), the production creates an interesting and memorable sound and Bowie had something to say.  Otherwise, this is another forgettable album ready for the dustbin.
B00006RCLQ|5.0|I had the misfortune of viewing this movie at the age of 7, late one night on New York television. I was unable to sleep for three nights straight afterward, and hold every other horror movie I've ever seen up to this one to see if they measure up. Usually, they don't even come close, resorting to cheap blood spatter and CGI tricks. The only notable contenders are THE HAUNTING (original 1963 Robert Wise version) and THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE. But don't watch *any* of these 3 films alone. Great spooky fun selections for a Halloween Movie Night.
0440238609|5.0|I just finished this series, myself, and I have to say that this is one of the best series of books I have ever read!  The depth of characters, the intricate plot, the twists and turns, and the emotional ties I experienced with this series was incredible.  I can honestly say that when I finished the last chapter of the final book that I was sad to see it end.  I still want more!  And the final book really struck home with me, stirring me emotionally and making me think more about and appreciate the relationships I have with others.    I would highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys sci-fi/fantasy and has an open mind regarding religion and the universe.  I really hope Pullman writes more on the characters in these epic books!

B00005O5CM|4.0|This funny and fastpaced movie is the best remedy for a rainy day or finding out, like Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), that your handsome boyfriend Warner Huntington III(Matthew Davis) has just dumped you. The plot is cute and doesn't claim to be \\"cerebral.\\" There's nothing really to the story beyond the adventures/misadventures of a California Blonde at Harvard Law School. Her snooty, uppercrusty classmates look down their noses at her because of how she dresses, speaks, and acts...to their way of thinking, Elle is laughably unsophisticated and lacking in taste, with neither a history of social progressivism with which to pad her resume nor a sense of genetic superiority. They are certain she doesn't belong at such a distinguished Ivy covered institution as Harvard. Elle, however, is determined to show them that a girl who doesn't wear argyle and loves to get her nails painted when she's under stress can be anything she wants to be. Every bit a funny piece of pink fluff. Enjoy!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|A great action movie that did not forget it was about people. Most modern action movies have 30 minutes of action but no charater or story development, Serenity delivers it all.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This is one of my favorite all time movies. Its not designed for children as it doesnt contain that kind of hero. I cant think of any other movie so loved and hated at the same time! Politics aside I thought it was a very good movie and without a doubt is different then all the other movies out there. I can understand why people can hate this movie based on todays political environment but I feel its unjustified. This is a movie that will last the test of time and will be considered one of the greats 10 years from now.
0316067598|5.0|This book was riviting, I never wanted to set it down, I was back between the covers whenever the opportunity presented itself; it was too hard to leave the author out in those mountains without finding out what happened next. Marcus you are a TRUE WARRIOR, if I could relive my 21 years of service after reading this book, I would definitely go SPECOPS, SF or SEALs.  I was deployed to Bagram 04-05 with the 25th ANV Bde, I was a 1SG with C CO 25th AVN Reg and I also served as a door gunner on the CH-47s during that time frame, logging more than 170 flt hrs. Not once during any of my flights did I think someone could pop up behind us and put an RPG round right thru the back ramp as the enemy did to the Night Stalkers aircraft in June 05, man did that incident open my eyes. However, I was always aware of our surroundings when we would put down on a LZ, a lonely mountain peak, or outside a FOB. It was not uncommon to see men walking around with AK-47s during these landings, but Allah help that SOB if he ever aimed it towards my aircraft, AK-47 vs M240 (M60 machinegun).  PO Luttrell's description of Afghanistan, the peolpe, and the mountains was right on the money, the country is absolutely breathe taking, if West Virginia hadn't taken the phrase 'God's Country,' I would have to give it to Afghanistan. I would love to go back, the people are great people when you're with them on their own ground; but, you need to keep your eyes open, the Taliban are present almost everywhere.  God bless you PO Luttrell and your brothers that wear the sacred Trident, and God Bless every member of the Armed Forces of America, past and present, for serving our country
B000M5B6Q0|4.0|I absolutely love this CD--of course I loved the movie, and therefore was very anxious to get the CD...  This is not something that you're going to find on the top 40 charts, but the CD is packed with feel good music that can get you through even the most stressful of traffic situations with a smile on your face.  I love that Hugh Grant actually sang on this sound tract, and I can't listen to \\"Pop Goes My Heart\\" without envisioning him thrusting his hips forward and flicking his wrists in his 80's fashion dance moves.  I also really enjoy the humor of the \\"Back into Love\\" demo session with Drew Barrymore.  If you're like me and you loved the movie, then the CD is definitely a must have too!

B000RG1FMO|4.0|After Late Registration, Kanye left quite a sour taste in my mouth.  Every interview with him would turn my stomach and the sight of him irritated me.  With every temper tantrum thrown, my disdain grew.<br />When this album was coming out, however, I was still optimistic because he makes music that doesn't sound like anyone else in hip-hop, yet sounds like him.  I was sure I would like at least 3 tracks off of this album, even if he made me ill.<br />I heard the first single, \\"You can't tell me nuffin\\" and wasn't impressed.  It was big on urban radio, but that meant nuffin to me.  Then I heard \\"Stronger\\" and knew that Kanye was going to offer something great, a departure from the rest, though I know the Daft Punk sample turned off many.<br />So 9/11, I snatched up my copy and took a listen.  Hats off to you Kanye!  He made an album I can definitely clean my house to, cook dinner, or ride out with.  The beats are fantastic without sounding like his old material (except 2 tracks).<br />Lyrically, however, there are many missteps.  Many will cite his odd pronunciation of words to fit rhyme schemes, but that's cool for me. Weezy does it with finesse so people don't trouble him.  So my issue isn't with delivery, but with content.  Kanye's best work is when he strips himself of the boastful braggadocio and puts his heart on his sleeve, insecure, unsure, and with doubt.  He borders on the tired formula of rap when he repeatedly addresses his dress code and how hot he is.  It's like he's trying to convince us because he's brainwashed himself and the people around him for so long.  Rather than making songs about something, he tells us how he makes songs about something...in every song.  I almost want to go back and listen to Late Registration again for lyrical content because I remember hating the beats more than anything.<br />Even the guest appearances are horrendous.  He should've had guest spots from Fonzworth, Common, or Talib.  I can't believe that Kanye was hotter on a track than Weezy???  I know this was a last minute addition to the album, but he should've just released this on the mixtape.  YUCK!  And the track with Mos Def is the pits.  How in the world did that happen? I understand what he was trying to do with that track, but the message is lost because the rest of the song is so terrible.  The beats save both of those tracks from being on the fast forward list.<br />Overall, even with his misses, he's still Kanye and it's actually enjoyable to listen to.  He is clever, fun, positive, and honest for the most part.  This is a CD that I'll play probably for the rest of the year, and that says a lot.  With all of the repetitive trash out now, I must commend him for this fun trip outside the box, music I can listen to in front of my daughter, and the positive energy that flows.  The underlying message in this album is that you can be anything you wanna be.  Ask the nerd who's an international superstar.<br />The Best: I wonder, Everything I am, Big Brother (ode to Jay-Z), Champion, Stronger, Flashing Lights, Glory<br />The Worst: Barry Bonds (feat.

B00004XQJX|5.0|Pollini remains my favorite in late Beethoven, with only the new Uchida giving him a run for his money among those I've heard.  This is a wonderful version of the Diabelli which I've only just begun to appreciate.  As I listen to it again and again I expect to find more and more.
B000N6UERK|4.0|*D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu* is the perfect blend of science fiction and action film for the average movie watcher as well as the science fiction fan. At its core, it is a thrilling, well paced action adventure story about an ATF agent, Doug Carlin, investigating a terrorist bombing on a ferry full of US Navy sailors in New Orleans. 540 people are killed in the massive explosion, but one young woman's body washes up and doesn't seem to fit with the other victims; though it looks like a victim of the explosion, the body was discovered 8 minutes before the bomb went off. Other pieces of evidence regarding this victim quickly lead Carlin to roughly piece together where she fits in the puzzle; unfortunately, none of it is enough to provide leads to the perpetrator.<br /><br />When Carlin presents his information to the FBI agents in charge, they are quickly impressed by his keen ability to size up a crime scene and filter out the noise from the pertinent details. They invite him to join a new test project that uses the latest technology to analyze a crime scene. Though the FBI and scientists involved try to hide the true nature of the technology, it doesn't take agent Carlin long to realize that there is more to it than advanced surveillance camera processing. This is where the science fiction weaves itself into the crime action drama film. While testing a new high-powered telescope technology, a way to bend the fabric of space/time is discovered, allowing the ability to watch the past in \\"real time\\" exactly 4+ days before.<br /><br />What makes this film work so well is that the action mostly takes place in the present, but the technology leads to some very good storytelling and the most interesting car chase ever conceived. I had read in some positive reviews that as good as it was it didn't fully make sense...well they are wrong - it complete sense - just pay attention to the details along the way and the story comes together nicely. Yes, there are a few inconsistencies - whose explanations probably were left on the cutting room floor to keep the film well paced - but they are small. If you have a basic understanding of the physics and space/time you can piece them together yourselves; if you are not, don't worry and ignore them because they don't take away from this very film.ly were left on the cutting room floor to keep the film well paced - but they are small.

B000RW3VD4|1.0|Wall Street is my favorite movie of all time, but after buying the VHS tape and then the original DVD release, I'll be damned if I'm gonna buy this movie again! I guess if you don't own it already, then you may as well buy this version.  For the rest of us, it's just the exact same movie repackaged again.
0446310786|5.0|The recollections of a young girl in a small southern town during the depression. Harper Lee adopts a near pitch-perfect voice of 'Scout' Finch as a narrator thinking back over the events and able to summon the 8-year old Scout to help tell them.  Thought often subtle, Lee keeps her eye on the subject of bigotry - bigotry of race, sex, class, education, family - and, through Scout's eyes, shines a spotlight on its cruelty and shows how the seeds are being planted for tidal changes that are on the way.  It's hard to imagine a better storyteller.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|....And it was a fantastic rendition of the novel. As true and close as you can possibly get to Jane Austen's vision with the time restrictions of being a movie. I felt sorry for Ann in the beginning, angry with her in the middle, and cried tears of joy at the end. To unwillingly deny the love of her life and still deal with a family who under-appreciates her is proof of her character and strength. In so many ways you can connect to Anne Elliot and her sad life. I bought the film on DVD and it's always a favourite choice of mine on those rainy weekend mornings when I curl up on the couch in my pajamas with a hot cup of tea. It's an emotional rollercoaster as only Ms. Austen can create. If you loved the book, you will enjoy this movie immensly. I know I did.

1582701709|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It badly written and it could probably be condensed into a pamphlet. She stretched it out by saying the same thing over and over and getting some other people to write similar things; mostly other people who have written trite feel-good books or trite self-help books on how to get rich. Rhonda and her \\"testimonial\\" cronies read like a bunch of rich, fortunate people patting themselves on the back and putting down everyone else.     Any book with a title like \\"The Secret\\" already sounds like a crock, but this book or belief system isn't even original. There are already many books about this subject, and this seems to have the least innovation and explanation.    To start out, it makes several outrageous claims. This lady claims that 1 The \\"secret\\" has been guarded and hidden for centuries, 2, famous dead people like Einstein, Edison and Shakespeare all knew \\"the secret\\" (how convenient that they're dead and can't defend themselves!) 3, Jesus was a millionaire, and last but not least, 4, The \\"secret\\" is scientifically proven. (Did anyone read the article refuting it in Scientific American? It was a great article.) Lots of people have conspiracy theories, or think alternate things about history, but most, if published, at least have some source cited (whether bogus or not)- but she simply states these things with absolutely no documentation.    The main outrageous claim of the book is of course that your thoughts determine what is going to happen in your life. If you play pretend and think that you have money, are thin, your soulmate is on the way, etc, it's going to start happening that way.     Few people will argue that positive thinking can motivate you to do something you otherwise wouldn't have the confidence to do. But sitting around and daydreaming without action is destructive and will probably frustrate you more. It borders on mental illness.     Here's what will really happen if you follow her advice: you'll lose all your money (from blowing it by believing you're already rich), you'll be one of those pathetic people who puts their life on hold until their spouse shows up (the book tells you to sleep on one side of the bed, have room in your house for them, etc, before you're there) and you'll be made fun of as you leave the house b/c you bought size 2 clothing (b/c you're supposed to believe you're already thin) even though you've been pigging out all week (because she says if you diet, you bring on more dieting)!    So why does cancer exist at all? Or weight gain? Why did people ever start thinking negative? If you read any scientific books about the actual Universe, you will see how silly this book is, even if the book doesn't deal with the same subject. This psuedoscientific book has nothing to do with science and most scientists would either laugh or be alarmed at its claim of being \\"scientifically proven\\". The funniest part is when she tries to act scientific and describes how \\"your thought electrically energizes you to the universe\\" or something like that. Looking at her picture I don't even think she can pronounce those words. Also, if the Law of Attraction is as much of a law as the Law of Gravity (which it isn't), then what if you keep visualizing something like defying grafity? What will happen then? This so-called law would actually be in violation of a lot of other scientific laws, and economically it is impossible. Not everyone can get rich. Already almost everyone envisions winning the lottery, but it still doesn't happen for most.     The downside of this \\"if you think positive you will get positive\\" belief is what I call Judgmental Optimism: telling people it is their fault that bad things happen to them b/c of how they think, and essentially blaming the victim. This book comes out and says it's your fault if a car hits you, or if any other misfortune befalls you (for instance rape, robbery, mugging) and it even says that groups of people (let's think 9/11, the Holocaust, etc) brought misfortune on themselves by believing that anything could happen. So why even bother with \\"be prepared\\"? Why even have a safety speech at the beginning of a plane ride? (Personally, I've noticed that when I go around happy, that's when something bad happens, but if I worry about something, that's when it doesn't happen.)    People aren't born thinking negatively; most kids are taught a sugarcoated \\"believe in yourself\\" generic message. When I was younger I had an open, friendly attitude, and expected people to be friendly toward me. I was out of touch with reality and pretty soon I got a lot of peer harrassment. Most people who have any distrust or negativity are the same; they got this way out of experience.     I'm not saying people shouldn't try to get past these things (although I realize how difficult it is), but Rhonda and her gang of Judgmental Optimists are just kicking people when they have fallen down and it is downright OFFENSIVE, particularly because of the gullible people who may believe this book and develop the same lack of compassion. There are a lot of people who really want to believe that life is fair or that there's some kind of organization to it, because they are too weak to accept that there is a lot of chaos. That's what makes this book go from untrue and badly written to truly offensive.
B000K7UBTI|4.0|It's a well done mix between CGI and hand drawn anymation and also it's a modern way to present a legendary Marvel hero. Recomended for all kind of Marvel fans.
B00007AJF9|5.0|I'll be brief, this movie is fantastic!!  I've become a huge fan of the Showtime show *The Tudors* and it has made me return to my love of history in that I've sought out gaps in my knowledge in media form.  I never saw this movie when it first came out and now I can truly appreciate it because of The Tudors show on Showtime.<br /><br />I caught this movie on HBO recently and I was thrilled because it filled me in on what the Showtime series will eventually get to.  It focuses on the reign of Elizabeth I, the illegitimate daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.<br /><br />It shows what Elizabeth endured as an outcast, after her father's death and during her 1/2 sister Mary's reign and subsequent death.  Mary was the daughter of Katherine of Aragon and Henry VIII and she never let Elizabeth forget that she was *the bastard child*.  She had her arrested and locked up in the Tower of London.  She was lucky she wasn't killed.  When Mary gets sick and eventually dies from cancer, the throne is turned over to Elizabeth as she is next in line, and catholicism in England dies.  Thus the start of the Church of England as Elizabeth is Protestant due to the connivings of her mother, Anne Boleyn.<br /><br />The movie also shows, fascinatingly I might add, that Elizabeth was considered the Virgin Queen as she never married, never wanted to due to her father's philandering ways, and died unmarried and childless.  Because of this, the Tudor's line died with her and that was the end of that.  In came the Stewarts [I think].  Anyway, her reign was considered \\"The Golden Era\\" and she was one of the most beloved Queens in the history of the monarchy.<br /><br />Cate Blanchette does an astounding job in this movie.  It is great!
B000AP04L0|5.0|This movie is so funny, my husband and I can't get enough of it.  This is not one for kids to watch with lots of bad language and rap songs in this movie.  A lot of the business aspects of this movie you can relate in some way or another.  I highly recommend this movie if you want a good laugh!
B0000033IR|5.0|It would be difficult to rate the best of Aretha's work, but this one must be considered. Everything fell into place in this beautiful production. \\"People Get Ready\\" was made for Aretha, one of the best of all time, in my opinion.

0316067598|4.0|First of all, I'd like to say I respect Marcus Luttrell and commend him for his valor.  He is a testament to the men and women fighting in our armed forces.  I thought this book was a wonderful read and I highly recommend it.  However, as a former Marine and proud liberal, I couldn't help but focus on Luttrell's rantings against liberals that sound as if he plucked them directly from the Rush Limbaugh show.  Throughout the book, Luttrell tries to place blame on \\"American liberals\\" for losing the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.  My issue is this: if the Bush Administration had not abandoned the true war on terror in Afghanistan, we wouldn't be in the situation we're in now.  Marcus, liberals supported the war in Afghanistan and still do.  NOT ONE liberal is demanding our troops to be removed from Afghanistan.  That's where the fight should be.  I thought it was strange how he never drew that conclusion in the book.  He just branded liberals with the same tired arguments as all delusional conservatives do.  Regardless, it is an intriguing story and tough to put down.
B000UR9QIK|5.0|This movie is awesome. I have all the other dvd releases and will definately be buying this Blu-Ray version as well. Can never have enough copies of a classic.   Can't wait to see it on my 73\\" WideScreen HDTV.     SWEET!

B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanye comes back with his third album and it is as good as his last two. He removes the skits just making a musical journey with his amazing beats and lyrical attack. Guests that join in this journey are T-Pain, Lil Wayne, Mos Def, Dwele, DJ Premiere, and Chris Martin of Coldplay, which all do good in their supporting roles. Favorites include Stronger, Good Life, Can't Tell Me Nothing, Barry Bonds, Drunk and hot Girls, Everything I Am, The Glory, and homecoming. Highly Highly Recommended release this year.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|First,I have to say that I have not seen the Broadway version of The Phantom of the Opera. However, I have listened to the CD of the Broadway version many many times. I checked this movie from my library. I absolutely loved this movie. The opening scene draws you into the story. I loved Gerard Butler's acting and singing in this movie. I think he did a wonderful job with the part. Emmy Rossum also did a wonderful job as well.
B000SQJ27I|5.0|There's no doubt that Manu Chao evolutioned his sound, and still staying recongnizable and familiar to his crowd. Compared to \\"Ultima Estacion Esperanza\\" this production has a lot more emphasis on guitar and bass and less sampling, reminding us his days with Mano Negra. The lyrics remain political and melancholic.
0802130208|5.0|The first time I started reading this (many years ago) I was probably about 20 or 21.  It was on the suggestion of someone older than me, who's opinion I valued, and who kept talking about how hilarious the book was.  I got a chapter or two into the book and gave it up, disappointed as I didn't think it was funny at all.<br /><br />Time goes by (several years) and I pick the book up again to have another go at it.  The book is amazing!  It is not funny as in 'funny HA-HA', so if you go in expecting that you will, like I was the first time, find yourself disappointed.  However, if you allow yourself to take the trip and see the characters and the situations, I don't know of many better ways you could spend your time.<br /><br />I love this book and if you are just about to read it for the first time, I actually envy you!
B000002KON|5.0|This is an amazing album. Not only does Ray Davies come up with what is possibly the most affecting and affectionate concept album ever, but the remaining Kinks are right alongside, framing these songs with the right ornamentation. Mick Avory and Dave Davies are the big surprises for me. Avory plays flourishes out of the Keith Moon book of rock drumming, then switches to a jazz-Dixieland type of drumming at the drop of a hat. Dave Davies has the reputation as a pretty primitive guitarist, which is extremely unfair - as the curlieque fills in \\"Drivin'\\" demonstrate. And that is a nice bit of Middle Eastern-influenced guitar in \\"Mr. Churchill Says.\\" A great one.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|The Axe Gang goes where it wants, does what it wants, and harrasses and oppresses whoever it wants. One day the gang shows up in a small town -- a town which tried to stay out of trouble -- to see about a small disturbance. Instead of imposing its will, the Axe Gang discovers the town's secret: Three Kung Fu masters have taken refuge there, unbeknownst even to each other. With damaged pride and reckless determination, the Axe Gang sets out to eliminate the three masters and take over the town. While the war wages, one enterprising young man tries to gain membership with the Axe Gang.     The movie was made in an entertaining style that is satirical of decades of martial-arts movies. Consider it Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with a sense of humor (I hate to use CTHD as an example, but it seems to be the most well-known movie to use the exagerated fight scenes).     This was so close to being a great movie to me. I really liked it and only have one complaint, and it is minor. One of my favorite elements to the movie was the dancing. It was a perfect element to a martial arts movie. Here was another choregraphed scene, dancing not fighting. And can't we get philosophical and say that in many ways fighting could be viewed as a crude form of dance? (Maybe I'm reaching a little bit there.) But the dancing occurs only when the Axe Gang has its confidence and as soon as it sees there is a legitimate challenger to its power, the dancing stops. And that disappointed me, but like I said before, it is only minor.     The plot is completely outrageous. If you do not like live-action movies with ridiculous story lines, Kung Fu Hustle is not a movie for you. If you want an atypical martial-arts movie that might make you laugh, check it out. I really liked Kung Fu Hustle.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Remember about ten years ago when this film swept the Oscars and Titanic merchandise of all conceivable varieties filled the shelves of every store? Now that all of that has had its time and that time has passed, what remains for us to concentrate on instead is simply the presence of a great motion picture. Titanic is a tour de force spectacle that forever raises the bar for all films and redefines what the word \\"blockbuster\\" means. This love story, tragedy, special effects showcase, historical film par excellence holds up flawlessly today and in some ways might even be better now not only because of that fact, but because once someone can separate James Cameron's achievement from the hype and hoopla that once all but swallowed Titanic, epic though it was, what is left is a film that is all the more surpassing for what it offers on camera. From its artistic recreation of the most famous luxury liner ever to exist, to its performances by a vast and talented cast, to the universally gripping nature of its central plot about disaster, irony, and  large-scale loss, Titanic is a movie that will always have meaning to viewers in any age, and for that reason and for every other I've cited, it is a classic and always will be.
B0000DDAU9|5.0|Mastodon has by no means peaked, but Remission to me is their best work thus far, when taken as a whole album.  I like the crushing guitars and that flurry of precise but effortless drumming (both of which are reigned in on later releases).<br />Now, i don't follow the band Mastodon that closely but I like what I hear on their albums, and this feels the most like everyone is contributing creatively, moreso than the more structured songs found on later releases.  Some may say it's too \\"jam\\" sounding, but I think that at the level that this is performed, it's a great experience.  Only thing left to be desired is the vocals (but none of their albums have satisfied me in that regard).
B000002V07|5.0|Mazzy Star includes: Hope Sandoval (vocals); David Roback (guitar); Keith Mitchell, William Cooper, Jason Yates.<br />Mazzy Star is like a mixed up mess of blues, country, and folk music all wrapped up in an occasional psychedelic twisty that reminds me of Jim Morrison from the Doors. The group and Star have that layed back, sip a drink, highly atmospheric sound --like you are floating in the clouds. I guess I would call it moody music, because you have to be a certain mood to take all of Mazzy in.<br />Favourite-Fade into you....awesome.
1400079276|2.0|The title above says it all, and perhaps the reason why I have responded so negatively to the book, is because I have read everything Murakami has ever written prior to Kafka on the Shore. I am noticing many of the reviews pertain to first-time readers of Murukami, and so I can completely understand how this blatantly esoteric miscellany of all his other works might come across as the beautiful dream-like introspection, first-time readers deem it to be. What startles me however, is all the heaping praise from the regular murukami enthusiasts. It has, honestly, got me wondering if I am not completely OUT-OF-MY-GATDAMN-MIND?!?! Haha..No Seriously.     The beauty of many of Murukami's prior works such as Wind-Up Bird..[an understated masterpiece] is the subtlety in the writing, the uniqueness of the different characters [in nuanced ways] and his ability to incorporate somewhat fantastical elements, but in a very balanced manner. All of that is missing in Kafka on the Shore, where you've got hair-brained clowns like Colonel Sanders and Johnny Walker monkeying around along the way to wherever this book is taking you.     If you've read Murakami before you know that kafka always plays central but lo-key in his books, yet here the book is titled as such and the point is made over and over throughout the storyline. If you've read Murakami before, this book should read like his personal writer's exercise book from which allegories, characters, and sketches of plot have been culled to create all the books he wrote before. In Summary, this book is the hither-thither effluvia swimming in his mind that he draws from to create masterful work. Its messy and we shouldn't be reading this, I prefer not to see the little man with the greasy comb-over pulling the ropes behind the velvet curtain....that's just me.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|There is too many good songs in this album from 1981...specially Silence and I, Sirius -Eye in the sky, Pshychobabble and of course one of most beautiful ballads ever \\"Old and Wise\\" that make me cry always.
B0002OERI0|3.0|I am dissappointed in this CD. My son loves Green Day but I don't love some of the lyrics. Can't they say what they need to say without foul language? Many other bands and songwriters do. My son says he doesn't pay attention to it, but I'm afraid if he listens too much he will start to pick up these nasty habits. I am saving Green Day for another day when he is older and can understand and handle such music.
B000002KFJ|4.0|Featuring the least endearing and most unflattering album cover in the entire Sabbath catalog,(save for \\"Born Again\\"), Sabotage is equal parts train wreck and brilliance: although the music and writing started to show the signs of wear and tear, there is enough creative work here to satisfy die hard Sabbath fans as well as casual listeners alike. \\"Sabotage\\" highlights a vastly improved production and wall of sound, promptly evident on the opening track, \\"Hole in the Sky\\", with its multilayered guitars and driving bass and drums. Although the song overstays its welcome, the message is clear: Sabbath is not dead yet.      For example, \\"Symptom of the Universe\\".... way before it's time, offered a glimpse of what hard rock/metal would be like 20 years later. Another example is \\"Am I Going Insane?\\" ....a melodic Ozzy classic, and to this day shines.      Some may say that \\"Sabatoge\\" was the beginning of the end for Sabbath.  While it is true that some of the material was failed experimentaion and subsequent releases would suffer, there was still enough creative juices flowing in 1975 to give this 4 stars.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Yes, you should have seen GRINDHOUSE in the theatre! It was an awesome cinematic experience and the faux trailers were so good! As far as DEATH PROOF goes, I personally think it's the best of the two films (Planet Terror/Death Proof). I applaud QT for presenting his heroins in a (somewhat) positive light. In true \\"girlfriends\\" fashion, we see how a group of women interact and react with each other, with other women, and finally, with a preditor. These women kick major a$$ but in a real way. For once, we see women not allow fear to paralyze them but rather, encourage them to fight for their lives. Awesome film. Feminist approved.
B0001KZM3O|3.0|Luis Mejia (son) - As the lines inside the booklet say, this is a Roger Waters album performed by Pink Floyd, and is credited as Pink Floyd because Columbia Records' anxiety was toward a new Pink Floyd album, not a Roger Waters album. This fact becomes really annoying even at the start of the album, as The Final Cut remains as a concept album about Waters' characteristic political directions and socialistic views, though this fact may be less annoying when the album is \\"performed by Pink Floyd\\" while the rest of the band were only pressured by Columbia, as this is a total Roger Waters' album; he wrote all of the compositions, and he even played some guitar pieces, but also the fact of Wright's being fired from the band in The Wall recordings is vaguely substituted in the album by a couple of organ/piano players. Its also their only album without a live support. Still the fierceful and deep, strong concept of the album, being precisely a requiem for the post war dream, is incredibly reflected on Waters' deep compositions and emotional lyrics, but its highly achieving concept is yet most expressed in its theme instead of its music, the songs' music is yet unreachable compared to the well crafted, hard theme of the album, unable to match the fiercefulness of its emotion, so the music in this album is underachieving, even in the opening \\"The Post War Dream\\" this is a notorious aspect, only the sensitive versatility of \\"The Gunners Dream\\" and the overwhelming dramatic atmosphere of the title track \\"The Final Cut\\" are worth in both its music and the fierceful emotion it represents, while the structure of the album gets quite predictable and even boring, but some less conceptual pieces get to hit the acquired taste of Pink Floyd, like the present psychedelia in \\"The Heroe's Return\\" and the awkward but yet hard rocking \\"Not Now John\\" seem to have a much meaningful cohersion. Still, this album would've been a lot better if this would have been credited as a Roger Waters album, which it truly is and Waters himself claims it, but the rest of the bandmates hypocrisy, just lead by Columbia pressures, made them forget about serious music deals and drain almost completely the album's talent, forcing Waters' to go off from the band at the end of the release of The Final Cut.m, which it truly is and Waters himself claims it, but the rest of the bandmates hypocrisy, just lead by Columbia pressures, made them forget about serious music deals and drain almost completely the album's talent, forcing Waters' to go off from the band at the end of the release of The Final Cut.

B000002A3T|3.0|Luis Mejia (son) - The Division Bell's situation was actually very alike with the previous A Momentary Lapse Of Reason, although in this album the band is in better form, with now the full transition of former keyboardist Richard Wright into the band, the album was much more well received and much more of a success, scoring a triple platinum certification. But apart from its success, the same fact stays in its music, the material brought up into the album was a much more commercialy-driven, and its bastardized style of a non-characteristic, light rock atmosphere in order to make the songs more accessible, makes it one of their worst efforts. Pink Floyd without Waters were just a group of talented musicians with a bunch of good ideas for putting them into paper, but nothing far from this, and, as previous Waters' compositions had such a powerful, fierceful brutality in its style, The Divison Bell possesses a great lack of meaning and devotion, much more of an album where they fit into much more overwhelming melodies, still the album's lack of intelligent/cerebral/complex material can be really dissapointing, its excessive keyboard-penned songs and its predictable, boring tunes doesn't make it nothing of a good album. Its compositions also possess a characteristic of having an accussing tone, specially in songs like \\"Lost For Words\\", \\"What Do You Want From Me?\\" and \\"Poles Apart\\" Still, only the fiercefulness and conceptual majesty of the album can be expressed in the song \\"A Great Day For Freedom\\", which actually has a comprehensible, well structured meaning about the fall of the Berlin's Wall, while more slight traces of fiercefulness and meanings are also found in the catchy, guitar penned \\"Keep Talking\\", and the most impressive, melancholic dramatic style of the hit \\"High Hopes\\". Noneless the material of The Division Bell is quite a dissapointment but much lesser than A Momentary Lapse Of Reason, and just because the album is one of the band's favourites, its remaining interest can be a slight consolation for the lack of fiercefulness, meaning and complex/intelectual material in the album.<br /><br />P.S.: don't be fooled by the grammy that the instrumental \\"Marooned\\" received, 'cause I haven't yet heard such stupidity in a grammy award since hard rock grammy on Jethro Tull Crest Of A Knave!ning interest can be a slight consolation for the lack of fiercefulness, meaning and complex/intelectual material in the album.

B000OZ2CZW|5.0|My opinion is extremely important as my reviews are monitored by the masses. This girl has something good going on. It's not good in a \\"bake a cinnamon apple pie and put some homemade vanilla on it\\" kind of way, but it's freakay good. I first heard the song umbrella when I was chasing locusts around my backyard in my motorized grocery cart. I cranked up the alpine system and made locusts fall out of the trees and start dancing with each other. It's a positive track in a world filled with people who don't like to work and eat too much trans fat. The album only improves from there. Shut up and drive is probably the best song about people talking on their cell phones while driving ever recorded. Why am I saying probably? It is. That reminds me of a story, nestle up to the computer and I'll craft a tale for you. I was out cruising the interstate one night in my fiero with J-abs and these hot chickadees were following us. So I think you get the point.    This is the CD that you and your grandparents should own. It's got everything your grandparents like: Slammin beats, great lyrics and some old school polka riffs that get a party jumpin. A couple of my grandparents are dead, but the two that are still alive both love some Rihanna. Your living relatives will enjoy it too! Rihanna stopped dating average two years ago, she wants me now.
B000002KNU|4.0|An odd debut, but a charming one--David Byrne's gawky, nerd-like personality never shone through better than here. It isn't as distinctive as Fear of Music or Remain in Light, and it's not as consistent, either. \\"The Book I Read\\"; \\"Who Is It?\\" and \\"Happy Day\\" did not deserve to make the final cut in my eyes. And it all sort of sounds alike, running together in a giant mush. But the mush sounds great. And it's really interesting to hear the group's twisted take on a pop song (the paranoid \\"Don't Worry About the Government\\"; \\"Tentative Decisions\\"; \\"Pulled Up\\"). And they do branch out of the rhythm guitar-bass-drums-keyboards-jerky rhythm thing once for a song I think is as good as anything else the group's ever done (\\"First Week, Last Week... Carefree\\" has horns and marimbas. It's like calypso! And I know nothing about calypso, so I don't know if that's good or not, but I find the song has a quirky charm). Meanwhile, who could've predicted that utter paradigm shift in \\"No Compassion\\"? That one really took me by surprise. I thought they were starting the next song, but I was proved utterly wrong. Then there are the two classic tracks: the danceable \\"Uh-Oh, Love Comes to Town\\" and the sinister funk-rocker \\"Psycho Killer\\". You don't want to miss either of those. Especially the second. Oh, and give a listen to the acoustic version of \\"Psycho Killer\\" found on Stop Making Sense, preferably the video version. One of the highlights of a concert film that is strictly made up of them. The album isn't bad, either. It gets criticized a good deal, but it's what made me a Heads fan in the first place, so I can't be that hard on it really. This is one of the Talking Heads' very best. I'd put it behind only Fear of Music and Remain in Light. Actually, the group's first six studio albums all range from good to masterpiece, so I recommend them all. It's when you get past Little Creatures when things start to get iffy.
1596912855|5.0|Austenland was great!  It was just what I was looking for - a romantic, fun book to read this summer.  I was afraid that it would be predictable - but not at all.  I loved the ending!      Great read - especially if you are an Austen fan.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Okay, let me tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna praise every song on this album, but one. That song, or rather, insulting debacle, is known as \\"Moonchild\\" (or \\"freakin' Moonchild\\", as I shall henceforth refer to it). I even like the first two minutes of it, when it's actually, you know, a song, but then when it turns into keyboard noisemaking I hit \\"skip\\". Okay, I like mindlessly hitting keys on my piano too. It's fun. It helps relieve stress. But in no way would I release it on an album and make other people suffer through it. I understand and respect that it's experimental, but it just doesn't sound good at all. In fact, it is terrible. Let the record show I listened to the whole thing once. Let it also show I never intend to do so again. Screw it. Let's move onto the other four songs. The ones that are actually songs (I don't count \\"freakin' Moonchild\\" as a song, see) all have a wide breadth of influences and moods: relentless, free-jazz filtered through Hendrix on \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" - the best part being the instrumental section, where the saxes duke it out, and the riffs are cool too. Plus, the singing sounds like Ozzy Osbourne's vocal on \\"Iron Man\\" - I always wondered what inspired that. Now I know! It's followed by the sighing, pastoral folk song \\"I Talk to the Wind\\". If \\"Schizoid Man\\" was Robert Fripp and Michael Giles showing off their chops, then \\"Wind\\" is Ian McDonald (later to work for freaking Foreigner... I mean, come on, how to you go from this to Foreigner?) showing off his. Those flute and clarinet solos areimpressive, to massively understate things. Then there's the classical, defeated \\"Epitaph\\", my personal favorite overall. I just want to savor that introduction - the saxes, the acoustic guitar, the flute, the mellotron... And then the lyrics. \\"Confusion is my epitaph!\\" Sweet, man. Sweet. And the epic nature of the song rules. I like epic songs when they're done well, and damn is it done well here. Both the songs also almost forecast the sound Pink Floyd (one of the greatest bands ever) would take on in the '70s. Skipping right over \\"Freaking Moonchild\\". (which is to this album as \\"European Son\\" is to The Velvet Underground and Nico), we have what just may be the album's most famous song: the title track. It's not rock at all. If anything, it's Medieval music, complete with creepy D&D lyrics. It actually sounds sort of like \\"Schizoid Man\\" flipped on its ear: the melody, drumming (stellar stuff, by the way), and overall mood of the piece are similar, even if this isn't a nutso acid-jazz fest. Oh, no. Basically, if you were to take off the ten minute random mellotron/guitar/drums restrained cacophony on a certain song that I've ripped open so many times here even I'm tired of it, then you'd have one of the top five greatest albums ever made. But no, they had to get all weird on us... oh well. This is excellent. Top-notch musicianship, memorable songwriting, all kinds of experimentation, and an unmistakably distinct sound. What more could you ask for? Besides... *resists making dumb comment about \\"Moonchild\\"*the sound Pink Floyd (one of the greatest bands ever) would take on in the '70s.

B000RG1FMO|4.0|I am from Chicago originally so it's good to see a hometown product do well. I like Kanye's latest entry I think while he is not the most talented MC in history he gives us a welcome break from the Soldier Boy, Walk it out and crap that is strangling hip hop. I also like the fact that kanye is ok with the fact that he isn't telling street tales in the classic sense but showing the other side of what people who may be from the streets have gone through. Our addiction to fashion. Our family issues etc. Back in the golden age of hip hop we had a wide variety of artists to pick from. If we wanted hard core street rhymes we could always pick up a NWA, Geto Boys album. If we wanted some knowledge we had KRS-One, PE, X-clan, Poor righteous teachers to choose from. If we wanted just party music we had Slick rick, Dana Dane, MC breed etc.. Nowadays we don't have that variety that made the music great. Hip hop needs MCs like Kanye, Lupe Fiasco, Wyclef Jean, Outkast to bring some different flavor back to hip hop. You know I am 30 yrs old with two kids I need to have some music that I can jam to with my kids in the car and Kanye has definately delivered again in that respect. Pick it up if you are a real hip hop head and can appreciate different styles.
B000VPUIA6|1.0|I have a copy of \\"HELP\\" on DVD already.  It came packaged with \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and several other Beatle discs (though not Let It Be/Yellow Submarine).  I agree that the aspect ratio is a bit odd.  However, the Criterion Laserdisc version should be as close to perfect as it can get.  The Criterion LD version of \\"AHDN\\" is excellent!
B000NA2BEU|5.0|My husband and I thoroughly enjoy Veronica Mars from week to week. However, Season 3 was what I would call mildly disapointing. Still great to watch and get into with its whitty scripts and lovable character profiles, but too many doors were open in the last half of the season that hadn't been explored.     Even through the disapointing ending of our favorite show, we are still big fans and will undoubtedly purchase the 3rd season on DVD to complete our collection.
B0000214F0|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst films ever made...It is consistently on Ebert's worst-film list, and with good reason.<br /><br />Terrible setting and background.

B000RG1FMO|2.0|The College Dropout was the album that convinced me that hip-hop was worth listening to. \\"Last Call,\\" \\"Get 'Em High,\\" \\"Breathe in, Breathe out\\" and \\"School Spirit\\" had some of the best beats I'd ever heard--and Kanye's flow was at time spectacular as well, especially on the second verse of \\"School Spirit\\" and the first of \\"Get 'Em High.\\" Not to mention that while I wasn't always a fan of the subject of his lyrics, Kanye's were often better and more introspective than most rappers' (\\"Jesus Walks,\\" \\"Never Let Me Down\\" and \\"All Falls Down\\" especially).     And then the best songs of Late Registration were just as good or not better. Where have you heard a better beat than \\"Heard 'Em Say,\\" \\"Touch the Sky\\" or \\"Gone\\"?     And then he produced this...I can't believe the general consensus is that these beats are good. These beats, for the most part, suck! I seem to be the only person who thinks the \\"Stronger\\" Daft Punk sample just doesn't work. I don't like \\"Champion\\"s beat, \\"I Wonder\\" at least has a good sample, but then the flow sucks. \\"Barry Bonds\\" and \\"Drunk and Hot Girls\\" are two of the worst songs I've ever heard! Kanye shouldn't apologize to Mos Def for \\"Breathe in, Breathe Out\\" he should apologize for putting him on this crappy song.     The album's not THAT bad, I guess. I like \\"Good Morning\\" a lot, \\"Homecoming\\" is pretty good, \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\" is okay, despite how \\"stupidly\\" he comes up with lyrics for it, \\"Flashing Lights\\" isn't terrible even though the beat kind of annoys me. I can't remember the name but I also like the song that rehashes \\"School Spirit\\" (the chorus goes \\"I'm a get on this TV, mama...\\"). And I also like the rap on \\"Stronger\\" despite it's weak beat.    The beats are just weird on this album. On the first half of the album I feel more like I'm listening to a crappy Flaming Lips cover band with rap instead of the amazing Kanye West.    It's just that College Dropout and Late Registration were two of the best hip hop albums ever made, and Graduation is, at best, mediocre. My eighth or ninth favorite song on College Dropout, \\"Two Words\\" would be my favorite or second favorite on this one (after \\"Good Morning\\"). That says a lot about how good College Dropout is, but also a lot about how mediocre Graduation is.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Every track on this album is just amazing, with the exception of \\"drunk and hot girls\\" that ones kind of whack, but i mean the production of the album really blew me away man!

B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanye West has another great album in Graduation. It's full of his politically and culturally charged lyrics as usual, but combined with excellent techno beats and tracks on many of the the songs, and a few of the classic style hip-hop beats on others. It's a very catchy album that will be sure to see many hits.

Jim also got this part shortly after he became super famous so obviously this role was playing to his strength of being a rubber-faced whack job.<br /><br />Fourth, though it was a neat thing to add Robin to the mix, Chris O'Donnell was too old, but, I suppose, having a kid running around in an anatomically correct rubber suit would have raised too many questions.<br /><br />This film was 50/50 for me.

B000QFAJ7S|2.0|In 1995, Alanis Morissette helped blaze a trail for people across the world with her international debut \\"Jagged Little Pill\\"; one of the most successful albums of all-time. Alanis emphasized all aspects of life; heartbreak, confusion, anger, optimism, laughter, failure, success, independence, love, and perseverance. Kelly Clarkson cites \\"Jagged\\" as her major influence for her latest release \\"My December,\\" but until I listened to this album, I did not realize how much of an insult that truly is. Alanis challenged listeners to take initiative and triumph over adversity, Kelly on the other hand, succumbs to her emotions too often and postures herself to be the victim in nearly every song. \\"One Minute,\\" \\"Sober,\\" \\"Be Still,\\" \\"Maybe,\\" and \\"Yeah\\" are the few exceptions. Aside from those five highlights though, this album has little to offer. This album portrays life as one tragedy after another and it begins to grow claustrophobic incredibly fast. Kelly has obviously not been burdened by enough hardship in her life to validate such emotions and the seemingly endless self-pity contradicts nearly everything Alanis stands for. It's not just the themes of this album that make it dreary, but the production as well. Apparently, Kelly is under the notion--or to be more precise, the fallacy that an album can only be sincere if it is stripped of all commercial viability. \\"How I Feel\\" dabbles in new wave pop and \\"Maybe\\" incorporates folk, both of which Kelly does a decent job of delivering, but when it comes to the rock songs (\\"Never Again,\\" \\"Hole,\\" \\"Judas,\\" \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\") her voice sounds shrill and can't even manage to hold its own amongst the barely-there production. Too many of the songs sound as if they were developed only far enough to reach the demo stages and then abandoned from there. This can hardly be considered true artistry or talent. The lyrics here aren't nuanced or diversified enough to truly make this profound either. Before you even reach the halfway point of this album, it dawns on you that you've heard essentially everything Kelly has to offer. \\"My December\\" lacks the straightforwardness of \\"Breakaway,\\" much less \\"Jagged Little Pill,\\" because it devotes too much of its attention to guarding itself from the mainstream. Ultimately, this album is built almost completely around pretense and relies too heavily on melodrama which makes for a truly disappointing listen.
B000009SFR|5.0|I cannot improve on any of the comments that heap praise on this album.  It really is an 80's masterpiece.<br /><br />Back in 2003, I had forgotten the title of my favorite song, \\"Funny How Time Flies\\" and had to call a DJ at KBIG 104.3 FM in Los Angeles, California to get the aforementioned title.<br /><br />Title in hand, I went down to Tower Records on Sunset (in West Hollywood) to pick up the disk.  Tower only had the GOLD Master Discs, for $26/US.  Expensive, yes!  But, I snapped it up anyway.<br /><br />By the prices I see now for the Gold Master Disc on Amazon ($90/US+), it seems that I made quite the bargain!<br /><br />Five Stars!
0385486804|3.0|I thought the book wasn't nearly as good as the reviews.  It is basically a story about a seriously misguided youth who had more regard for the words of dead authors who never followed their own advice than common sense to preserve his own life.  Nonetheless, the story itself was still interesting; there just wasn't nearly enough of it.  I was distracted by the dozens and dozens of literary quotes offered apparently as relevant to the story; in actuality, they seemed self indulgent.  I also found the side stories about other prior misguided adventurers to be distracting not very interesting.  I guess there were a lot of pages to be filled since really so little was known about what happened to Chris during those days.  In contrast, I read Into Thin Air and enjoyed it very much.
0321344758|5.0|Steve Krug's book is full of solid, easily understood advice on web usability. But even more than that, he covers a lot of ground, indirectly, on how to deal with clients (for web designers) and how to think about, plan, and execute a web project (for the rest of us). Add to that the clear layout and design of the book, the engaging writing and humor, and you have probably the best book on usability design on the market.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater twice and can't wait to see it again and again. Besides being one of my favorite songs, \\"Amazing Grace\\" is now one of my very favorite movies of all time.  The story is told very well, bringing the viewer into the scenes (at least I felt as though I were there--especially into the parliament debates).  All the acting was superb. Albert Finney's portrayal of John Newton was wonderful. Although he was not as suave and good-looking in this one as he usually is, Rufus Sewell (a favorite of mine) did a great job.  And Ioan Gruffudd just took my breath away!  He WAS William Wilberforce. (He was new to me in this film, and to me he is the most handsome actor in movies today.) The true story illustrated that something very big can be accomplished with faith, prayer, patience,  persistence, and dedicated help.  In spite of many obstacles and much resistance, Wilberforce never gave up, and he made a very big difference.

096798467X|5.0|If you are looking to build an outdoors oven, you must read this book.  Even if your goal is not an earth oven.  Besides detailed information about the techniques to build an earth oven, Kiko describes very clearly the process of baking with wood and goes thru all the alternatives.  His insight in using different types of materials is very valuable and his opinions are explained thoroughly.    The book is also very well written and engages you from the beginning.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Welcome to the world of Dexter.  A man who has knowledge of good and evil, but who has a compulsion to kill by chopping up people who \\"deserve\\" it.  Someone who plays the part of a completely normal functioning person in society while hiding this dark secret.  His idea of excitement isn't intimacy with his girlfriend, but a psychological cat-and-mouse with a fellow serial killer.    The excellence in the show's development and writing doesn't come from the simple irony of a police forensics analyst being a serial killer or any of those other previously mentioned mechanisms.  It pulls off its brilliance through the subtlety of a person who knows he's different and playing all the games that \\"normal\\" people play to the best of their ability.    \\"Dexter\\" also builds a strange empathy towards Dexter.  The viewer knows Dexter's a relatively cold-blooded killer and yet we don't feel particularly compelled to see him get caught.  Dexter's good with kids.  He cares for his sister.  He has an almost innocent immunity to sarcasm and innuendo.  What is a little dismemberment?  Maybe being a serial killer is a bit of an extreme character flaw, (though this may be reading into the show too much) he is just really an exaggeration of anyone who may have one or two strange quirks but function fine in the real world.    Overall, Dexter makes for compelling TV.  It displays the violence and unfiltered language you would expect from Showtime, but doesn't sicken you with gore.  It's a unique show that deserves a look even for the squeamish.  Think of it as more of a character-driven version of CSI where the good guy and the bad guy are the same person.
B00005ATZT|4.0|1993's \\"The Fugitive\\" stars Harrison Ford as the title character in a very worthwhile movie remake of the 1960's television series that starred David Janssen.<br /><br />As in the TV series, Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) is falsely convicted of having murdered his wife but escapes from custody during a spectacular train wreck.  Kimble returns to Chicago to seek the one-armed man who really killed his wife, while trying to stay one step ahead of his relentless pursuer.  Tommy Lee Jones reprises the role of Gerrard, the obsessed detective of the TV series.  Kimble's search for the real killer will end in a dead heat with Gerrard's pursuit of the runaway doctor inside a Chicago hotel.<br /><br />Although obviously lacking the extended suspense of the four-year TV series, the movie captures the essential elements of its predecessor.  The Fugitive tracks the real killer through a thin string of clues. At the same time, he must stay on the move and off the grid to avoid his relentless police pursuer.  Along the way, his random acts of kindness for total strangers convince the viewer of his real innocence.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is entirely credible as the doctor on the run, in a more emotional portrayal than the stoic David Janssen.  Tommy Lee Jones as the pursuing U.S. Marshal is a more complete and sympathetic character than Barry Morse's grim, humorless rendition in the original series, enough so to rate a OSCAR and his own sequel (U.S. Marshals).<br /><br />The availability of modern special effects and the need to pack the story into a feature length movie makes for breathless pacing, as the Fugitive makes a series of spectacular escapes from the law, beginning with the train wreck that saves him from the death house.  Of necessity, Kimble's trail of clues is fairly intact and leads him fairly quickly to the one-armed man, and to an unsuspected and deadly conspiracy.<br /><br />Fans of the 1960's TV program will enjoy this well-done movie if they can handle the time compression; viewers arriving fresh to the story will find this a breathless and thrilling chase with a surprising ending.the story will find this a breathless and thrilling chase with a surprising ending.
0321344758|3.0|A good book for web design beginners who are just starting their studies or careers in the industry. Someone with a lot of UI design and usability experience won't probably get anything new out of this one (except some perspective I guess).    The book is covering only the basics and is very light on content. On the other hand once you've got those basic design principles you are ready to go. The book is also very fast and fun to read and the author definitely has his own humorous style of writing. I hope we'll see more web design books like this one in the future. Books that are easy to digest between more serious reading.    Other related suggested reading could be the [[ASIN:032145345X Designing the Obvious: A Common Sense Approach to Web Application Design]] by Robert Hoekman Jr. which is a bit more serious title but definitely good reading too.
B00004Z4SD|4.0|I was surprised I had somehow missed this Disney gem when it came out. I happened across it looking for rentals and it was an excellent one. I now plan to get a copy. It is one of those movies that isn't exciting but takes you on a journey of discovery. The beautiful late Summer and Fall countryside in Iowa and Wisconsin are a nice backdrop to this sojourn for Alvin Straight to see his ailing brother. How many would attempt to pull a trailer with a riding mower across 260 miles of state highways? Not many that is for sure. Alvin Straight's own failing health has made him realize that his ten year dispute with his brother just doesn't matter any more.<br /><br />Alvin recalls him and his brother growing up on a farm and caring about each other. Now he must use the only thing he can to get there, a riding mower. Straight meets interesting people on his journey just like Bert Munro did in \\"The World's Fastest Indian\\". Sissy Spacek is excellent as Straight's handicapped daughter. The movie is an emotional ride at a pace equal to Alvin's mower, and that's a good thing. If you enjoy movies like \\"The World's Fastest Indian\\", \\"Second Hand Lions\\", and \\"The Station Agent\\", you will probably like this one. Disappointedly there are no extras on the DVD. I was hoping to see a documentary about Alvin Straight, or at least about making the movie.

1401211909|5.0|As I imagine will be the case with many, I saw the film before ever hearing of the book upon which it was based. The book has some significant differences in plot and flavor as compared with the film; the book is more subtle, and I think I would have enjoyed the subtleties more had I not seen the film--which has much sharper, larger-than-life, contrasts, and a faster, more tension-filled pace. In any case, I enjoyed both.
0743486285|5.0|In 1987 Motley Crue recorded Girls, Girls, Girls, toured with the then unknown Guns 'n Roses, sold out shows around the country (and world) and partied like they always had a day left to live.  The previous book to tell the tale of this excess, The Dirt, felt more like a glorification of the excesses of the band, even though it addressed all the drug abuse Nikki Sixx subjected himself to, subsequent overdoses that almost killed him and reemergence towards a cleaner lifestyle.  Basically, you take those chapters of The Dirt and make them their own book and you have The Heroin Diaries.<br /><br />The book is set up like a diary.  In fact, it is a diary: the book accounts the year (Christmas 1986 to Christmas 1987) that Nikki spiraled down a deep hole of addiction and depression and kept insanely careful track of it in a notebook.  In addition to his entries (cleaned up a bit so we can understand them), Nikki includes commentary from himself as well as those who were close to him at the time (it's clear that a lot of care and work was undertaken to get all of these voices lined up to tell this story).<br /><br />I'm reminded of one entry where Nikki says in passing that he had a blast at a radio interview the other night, but probably got the DJ fired.  The commentary afterwards is the DJ's account of the debauchery that went down that night (and, yes, he did indeed get fired).<br /><br />Nikki doesn't pull any punches and asked all of his contributors to do the same.  They are brutally honest and help paint a magnificent picture of what it is like to find yourself on a speeding train charging forward into a brick wall.  If you ever wanted to know what the rock and roll lifestyle was like, or what it feels like to be addicted to drugs, this is the memoir for you.<br /><br />It's actually amazing to me that there could possibly have been any lucid entries.  We assume of course that a number of them were cleaned up by the editor, but there are times when you are stunned at Sixx's foresight into the future of the industry (the eventual downfall of the hair metal genre by the flood of copycat bands), the future of the band (that they'd make their next record a #1 album) and even his own dim foreboding of the consequences of his lifestyle.<br /><br />He talks to the diary as if it were a person, as if it were his wife and only confidant in the world during that year (and it probably was).  He addresses it with things like, \\"I have to go to the show now, but I'll see you when I get back tonight.\\"  When he departs without an entry for several days (sometimes simply because he is sober and sane) he is always apologetic and makes jokes about how he only writes to it when he is on drugs.<br /><br />The book pages are broken up with scribblings, notes that presumably came out of the original dairy (To Do lists, lost lyric ideas, notes and the like), drug abuse inspired art and photographs of the people and places addressed, as well as song lyrics from a whole career of Sixx's songwriting.  There are Motley Crue songs, songs from his 58 solo album, and songs from bands Nikki has adored in his life and reflect his lifestyle then and now.<br /><br />Each chapter is a month in the year, with an introduction, intermission and afterward included to set us up, take a break to reflect and plow forward into the future.  The afterward in particular is interesting, because in it Sixx explains what happened in his life after that year: getting on and off the drugs, his failed marriages, his struggling band, his solo projects; everything (he calls it his Life After Death).  It goes up to and beyond everything covered in The Dirt, and answers a number of niggling questions leftover from that book, like what was going on during the Girls Tour, what did some of the people mentioned in that book think about things discussed (Slash talking about his interactions with Nikki back then and his own struggling band and drug addictions), or whatever had become ofcertain events (like all that drama with Vanity).<br /><br />I found myself taking the ups (yes, there were good days) and downs along with Nikki on his ride of drug use, paranoia, rage, attempts at detox, thrills and pitfalls of touring, women, joys of songwriting and love of music, falling off the wagon, struggling on, wondering if he was killing himself, hoping for a way out, dying and coming back to life.  I found myself reading an entry, wondering a question about it, and having it answered by the commentary.  I also found myself wondering if the now clean and sober Vanity, turned Evangelist, is really any less insane than she was back then.  Sure the drugs are gone, but the woman seems like she has a few permanent screws loose (there's one entry where she rambles on about the devil, leaving you thinking, \\"huh?,\\" and then there's Nikki's commentary under hers going \\"Huh?\\" as well: fantastic!).<br /><br />The book has a message and Nikki Sixx has a hope that by writing this, that by laying his weaknesses bare for the world to see, that maybe that message can get through to people: the tunnel is dark but there is a light at the end, and even though it's probably better if you don't get into that tunnel in the first place, just because you are there doesn't mean there is no hope for you.<br /><br />I'm definitely sold on this book, as I was already sold on the sountrack weeks ago.  I highly recommend it to fans of the band, fans of rock and roll, people interested in learning about the dangers of excess and any open-minded and curious individuals in general.  It's a good read all around.y).

B000RG1FMO|4.0|I see all of the negative reviews and I wonder what kind of music are they listening to. To be quite honest, there is not a lot of good hip hop out there. By far I believe that he is creating original concepts with his music.    There are 2 songs that I am not really feeling, but who cares? They arent wack, they just arent for me. Get the album and see for yourself. It is worth the money.
B000I5Y8ZU|2.0|I was pretty pumped for the release of this CD.  I have their DVD and last two CDs.  So I got home and put it in the CD player ready to rock out.  Having heard the Black Parade song on TV, I thought that I was going to love this CD.  Welcome to the Black Parade was an ok song.  I thought it would be the opener... anyways.  I listened to the whole CD and just sat there in my computer chair, not in awe, but in dissapointment with the exception of Teenagers.      Am I the only one who thinks that all they did was take most of their songs off the last CD, add in some more bells and whistles, and then put it back on a new CD?  I can't say that I was impressed as much as I hate to say it.  Gerard's singing style on the BP sucks.  He is not a smooth singer.  He is a punk rock singer.  He has no place in ballads.  They said that this was going to be an epic CD, and it is to an extent.  It builds up but to the point where I am like enough with the epic sound.  Let's hear a real song.      Well if you like this CD then good for you.  I don't.  This is the end of MCM for me unless they do something totally more like their older stuff next time because I don't think I could stand myself if I spent more money on them.  I recommend any cd by Incubus (my favorite band ever) or the newest Smashing Pumpkins cd.  It rocks and I don't care what anyone says.  The new Senses Fail cd was even better than the Black Parade.  Check it out too if you haven't.  Until next time.....
B0000CFW87|5.0|I got called to be an extra on a music video being shot at an old theatre in LA. When I heard it was Josh Groban my wife volunteered to take my place. No chance. I was aware of his music but never was I so aware of his talent until the 2nd day of the shoot and I got tired of waiting in the extras waiting room and wandered out to the theatre. A beautiful, Greco-ornate theatre. I was sitting right outside in the lobby of the theatre when the music for YOU RAISE ME UP started. The lobby was engulfed with what sounded like voices from Heaven. I have never felt so stirred and I moved into the theatre and sat for the next 4 or 5 hours watching Josh sing this song take after take after take. He never missed a beat and each take was as equally beautiful as the next. As each camera angle was changed or lighting adjusted Josh would just fill that theatre with a voice so gifted and so powerful it would make you shiver. I got to meet him later in the dinner buffet line. He was so nice and down to earth it was hard to believe this was the same man with that majestic voice. Incredible music. Incredible talent. I have a feeling his best is yet to come.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|When I wrote this, I knew what I was talking about and like I predicted two Grammy's Best Rap and Best Rap Collaboration!    Lets just set the record straight once and for all every note you will ever hear again is a copy remake of the original.  Everytime you buy a new pair of jeans they are new but they are a copy of the original.  So let us get over the whole idea of sampling because there is nothing else orginal. Lets just appreciate that some old familiar song was the inspiration of a new song with new thoughts and ideas.  That is all we can ask for. I like Kanye because he trully is a composite of a middle-class kid growing up in the 80's.  His lyrics effectively express the ambition, desires and often wishes of someone influenced by popculture during that time and we all are to some degree or another, and he made it.  The tracks are upbeat, fresh, innovative.  The collaborations are solid.  I had no desire to skip a track until track 8 Drunk Girls w/Mos Def, it was a slight bump in the road but after listening to it a couple of times I understand the purpose and what it is saying, but I would not say it is my favorite track.  Otherwise, the other tracks flow I mean with Dwele, Barry Bonds w/Lil Wayne(giving props to Barry Bonds in a big way the track is hot, creative and lyrically expressive with enough irony to get his point across). Kanye is a jewel to this rap industry whether people understand it right now or not simply because he has the intellect and craftiness to speak through two voices the hood and the middle-class. he mentioned Lauryn Hill, who he gave props and said since she wasn't on the scene, he has to take her place. He also states that he is between Charles and Gnarls Barkley.  He has pegged himself quite well and this album IS true hiphop because it reflecting and teaching at the same time.  It is much of a novelty for commercial rap to do this and this is why I believe he has risen to the status that he has in American Music/Pop-Culture asrelevant, and he reflects this when he mentions the Paparazzi.  I can definately relate to the lyrics;  Yeah, Kanye, Wait Till I Get My Money, Right Bet You Can't Tell Me Nothing--Right.     Go Head! Kanye, Do Your Thing.

With that said, it offers useful advice and answers that can be understood without all the misc stuff tossed in.  The writer is witty, which I enjoy, but others might not.  The book is small enough to toss in your camera bag.  I love it and will keep it with me for a while.

The gag reel is very funny and the vignettes about the various urban legends are quite interesting.  I didn't realize how much research and background information goes into each episode.  The production values on this TV show are very high -- the episodes all have a 'movie' feel to them and the cinematography is beautiful. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki give excellent performances throughout as Dean and Sam Winchester. The brotherly relationship is one of the best parts of the series. Oh yeah, and its creepy scary too!  Treat yourself to this AND the season one DVD's. You won't be disappointed.

Two full performances and two completely different shows. JDM is drunk? So what? This album brings the Doors true performance out - not like the sterilized yet nonetheless entertaining staple \\"Absolutely Live\\". I sat and listened just to find out, as the audiences did, what Jim would do next. I LMAO at Jim singing \\"blah, blah, blah\\" to Light My Fire.<br /> But the Doors weren't just Jim Morrison and his band as some people would have you believe. There were three extremely talented musicians that made the music for his words and entertained us w/ improvised jams while JDM was \\"briefly incapacitated\\" during his performance. And I listened to the solos and thought: \\"Where have I heard these guys, this DOORS sound, before?\\"<br /><br />Of course - \\"Riders On The Storm\\", formerly known as \\"Doors of the 21st Century.\\"<br /><br />If you haven't seen Ray and Robby play in their new incarnation as \\"Riders On The Storm\\", then you MUST. You won't see Jim but you'll hear the Doors and you'll know that it wasn't just Jim that made the Doors great.<br /><br />Buy this record!<br /><br />Go see Ray and Robby and \\"Riders On The Storm\\"!<br /><br />Rock on \\"Riders\\".<br /><br />Rock on \\"Ray and the Sex Machines\\"!

B0002VKZL6|5.0|Wow, I cannot believe some of the reviews in here. Although some of the people knocking this CD are complete idiots, so I don't know how seriously to take their attacks. As someone that owns every release that Mark Knopfler has ever made, some people might question my objectivity, but here goes. This CD opens with three great songs in a row. In fact, I put \\"Sucker Row\\" up there with anything Mark has done, addictive. \\"5:15 A.M. is a classic opener as well. Most people sing the praises of \\"Song for Sonny Liston\\" and rightfully so, great track. OK, maybe there are one or two songs that are not \\"great,\\" but give the guy a break, it is hard to stay at the level he has been at with his first three solo albums. That being said, Knopfler has nothing to apologize here for, it is still the same great storyteller and incredible guitarist. If you are a real fan, you will like it.
B00022M518|4.0|Early Eno albums have a strange feel. Vocally he is not as strong as his contemporaries. He is no Bowie. Lyrically, his songs are quite silly. Musically he strove to get as much as he could out of the technology of the times. Others have been able to do more now because of the technology, but have not done more creatively. So even though individual aspects of his work are not always that strong, there is still something capitivating about these recordings. They make great listening, and what else do you want?
B000VDDDY6|5.0|To rebut another review, anything professionally shot on 35 mm film, whether from the 1960s or 2007, is natively high-definition--that is, the amount of information that has been recorded on the MASTER is equal to or greater than HD standards.  It's only the duplications that, until HD mastering, were of lesser definition.  That's the reason studios at first were so hesitant to adopt HD DVDs--it diminished the value of their master if everyone had a copy as good.  So when a film is remastered in HD from an original film master in good condition, it's true HD and not \\"extra pixels filling in empty space.\\"  Remastering, of course, can be done well or poorly, accounting for differing quality in the final product.  Anyone who's seen these remastered episodes knows how fantastic they are--both for how great they look and, yes, how they show up the wooden sets and cheap costumes, etc. from the period.  But that's part of the fun!  What's astonishing is how well this show holds up in HD, and how much the new effects extend its original vision.  Kudos to the remastering creative team and crew for a Star Trek experience that's reverent to the original yet new again!

B00006IM9Q|5.0|THE BAND: Deborah Harry (vocals), Chris Stein (guitars), Jimmy Destri (keyboards), Gary Valentine (bass), Clem Burke (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2002) 19 tracks clocking in at approximately 67 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page foldout containing song titles/credits, several band photos, a short intro on each studio release, what songs came from which albums and the year released. This release follows Blondie from 1976 though 1999. Label - Chrysalis/Capital.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: Blondie (3 songs), Plastic Letters (2), Parallel Lines (5), Eat To The Beat (4), Autoamerican (2), The Hunter (1), No Exit (1), American Gigolo Soundtrack (1).<br /><br />COMMENTS: Growing up outside of NYC in the 1970's and 80's it was hard to not hear Blondie frequently on the radio. She was a NJ/NY product that put in her time and did particularly well on the local underground scene (Club 51, CBGB's, Max's Kansas City). I put Blondie in the same lofty category with my other favorite female rockers - Pat Benatar and Heart... though Deborah Harry & Co had a much more varied repertoire of songs. Blondie started with light punk, went to rock, then disco/dance/rap, reggae, new wave, back to rock, and ending with poppish light adult contemporary. The band's prime years were 1978 (\\"Parallel Lines\\") through 1982 (\\"The Hunter\\"). Harry would go solo in the mid 80's and most of the 90's, with stints on TV, movies and Broadway. None of Harry's solo career is included here. THE GOOD: All the hits are here in their 24-bit digitally remastered glory - including \\"One Way Or Another\\", \\"Heart Of Glass\\", \\"The Tide Is High\\", \\"Rapture\\", \\"Sunday Girl\\", \\"Rip Her To Shreds\\", \\"Call Me\\", \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Union City Blues\\", \\"(I'm Always Touched By Your) Presence, Dear\\", etc. Blondie's first \\"Best Of\\" (1990) disc is now obsolete - all 12 of the songs from this release are here... plus 7 more. This \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection offers a better overview of the band and its punk beginnings (giving the listener 5 songs from the first 2 albums - prior to the band's mainstream success). Her 2 best albums, \\"Parallel Lines\\" and \\"Eat To The Beat\\" are nicely represented here (9 songs in total). All tracks digitally remastered - the songs sound crisp to a fault. THE NOT SO GOOD: Every compilation is not without flaws. However, Blondie's \\"Greatest Hits\\" is as close to perfection as one could hope for. Two severely small gripes - the tracks are in random order. Personally, I like to see a band's long compilation in chronological order... so you can hear the band evolve over the years. And, only a few songs missing (not hits, so I understand) - a few personal favorites - \\"Die Young Stay Pretty\\", \\"Accidents Never Happen\\", \\"I Know But I Don't Know\\" and \\"Shayla\\". Perhaps a 2-cd set is on the horizon with additional songs from her solo career, a song or two from her \\"Curse Of Blondie\\" (2003) release, and other songs featured on additional movie soundtracks. OVERALL: Extremely solid Blondie collection on one disc. Don't want to invest in the individual albums?

0375423877|4.0|Written by a man, The No1 Ladies' Detective Agency has enough of a feminist persepctive for me to feel I was reading something actually written for me, rather than feeling as I usually do when reading, that I am trying to take pleasure in literature created for an audience of which I am not a part. McCall Smith' s feminism is simple but fundamental : men should not beat their wives, the better fathers are those who encourage their daughters to be independent and realise their dreams, women have a right to happiness.<br /><br />These beliefs are just part of the basic philosophy of the central character, Mma Precious Ramotswe, the first lady detective in Botswana, who imparts her basic moral philosophy at the same time - murder is worse than lying, relationships are more important than money, intuition is a kind of knowledge. While all of this philosophy may seem clich&eacute;d, as perhaps it is, it appears naturally in the book as part of the character and helps us to understand her approach to solving the cases brought to her.<br /><br />Woven throughout all of this is a picture of Botswana, considered by Ramotswe, and presumably McCall Smith, as the best and most successful country in Africa. Independent from the British since 1966, there is enormous pride in her accomplishments, and only the ongoinging black magic practices of some of the country's witchdoctors cast a shadow on the shining accomplishments of Botswana's diamond-fueled progress.<br /><br />Most powerfully of all, it is the love of the land that sings throughout the book. Botswana - stretching from the Kalahari desert to the Limpopo river, a country where « there is a place  for me, and for everybody, to sit down on this earth and touch it and call it their own ». A country with its distinct riches - « that was what her country was so rich in - emptiness...those empty spaces, those wide grasslands that broke and broke the heart ». With its thorn trees that know how to survive in the searing heat and the birds and snakes of Mother Africa. Where nature is a family member and where the rising of the sun and its setting at the end of day are events to be savoured in the daily rhythm of life.<br /><br />I read this book in a relaxed afternoon, and felt I had passed my time with a pleasant companion, who had painted pictures for me of a place I might otherwise never visit.Mother Africa.

B000RG1FMO|4.0|Many years some young kid up in the bronx took an extremely simple synth part by an german techno group. put some 808 drums on it and the rest was history, before this time all mc had to rap too was straight disco and rock instrumentals(whole records not just samples).  THIS IS THE TRUE HISTORY OF HIP HOP LIKE IT OR NOT.     Being a good student, Kanye studied this formula and mastered.  For my true hip hop heads( not just fans) out there we know no one \\"chops\\" samples like kanye since the days of pete rock, easy mo b, and primo. You can clearly see that some of his teachers have been RZA, Puffy, Pete Rock, Easy Mo B, J dilla, and Eric Sermon    He's not rakim, nas, biggie,or eminem lyrically,  but neither is most of today's mc's.  please be honest most of todays mc's are very bad ( crank that soldier boy!!), but they still have there place in hip hop, like bizmark did back in the day.    But  kanye is not afraid to be original,  like that young kid up in the bronx (circa 81) no one in the bronx was playing german techno in the early 80's  and are not now for that fact.  Bambaataa's  daring creativity basically laid the foundation for hip hop( musically speaking).    Kanye uses artist from across the sea's because he's the same kind of music visionary that the early hip hop founders were.     There are some weak points on the cd, of course being creative can go terribly wrong, kanye also proves this on some tracks.     Too me it's not a classic,  but it a very good cd and I think it will grow on many people and win new hip hop fans, It shows another side to hip hop that 50 just doesn't show.
B000002A33|5.0|When I listen to \\"Dust\\" nowadays it really makes me question why the Screaming Trees never received the recognition of their contemporaries. While Alice In Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam surged into the limelight with passionate grit and angst, The Trees forged their own loyal allegiance through low-key yet equally admirable releases. \\"Dust\\" was the last of these releases, and proved to be a glorious swansong and the band's best.<br /><br />For those unaware of the band's style and sound, I would urge you to try and separate them from their grunge era tag. Do not expect raging distorted guitars and aggressive vocals. Instead Screaming Trees fuse soaring melodies and harmonies, infectious chorus hooks and 60s psychedelic rock into their sound. The result is intriguing and unique, and is given further prowess and individuality by front man Mark Lanegan. Lanegan's wonderful gravely and brooding tone is sumptuous throughout, elevating the band's music.<br /><br />What makes \\"Dust\\" such a special album for me is its consistency. The band was always able to write excellent songs, but always seemed to struggle to recreate this consistently throughout an album. \\"Sweet Oblivion\\" touched on the consistency needed, but still contained the odd lacking track that I would always skip. With \\"Dust\\" I can simply press play, sit back and enjoy its entirety. There are still standout tracks however, such as the stunning \\"All I Know\\" which has the most glorious of chorus harmonies. \\"Make My Mind\\" is one of the band's classic songs; showcases great pop sensibility in the main hook. \\"Dying Days\\" is perhaps the band's most well crafted song, shifting between subtle slow-burning verses and uplifting choruses. More psychedelic tinges are introduced with the swirling ballad \\"Traveler\\" and the intense closer \\"Gospel Plow\\".<br /><br />For fans of the band's earlier releases \\"Dust\\" is a must have. It contains their best and most consistent writing, and remains one of my favorite albums from the Seattle era.
B000RO9PXC|5.0|I half expected the worst after reading some of the reviews, but this recording actually kicks major butt. Yes, Jim doesn't give his best performance, but it is fascinating nonetheless. As noted in the liner notes, was Jim simply bombed, or was something else going on? The interplay between Jim and the audience is fascinating, especially after Miami, and whatever his performance shortcomings, the band makes up for it as they are in particularly fine form. If you want a polished live album, then go for Live in Detroit, or the In Concert collection. If you want a full-throttle, warts-and-all historical document, this is it. A must for serious fans.
0679746323|4.0|If nothing else, this book is deeply fascinating. The questions of historical precision are raised in even a rudimentary Google search for reviews, yet this is still a book very much worth your time to read. The authors make it eminently obvious they hold no love for Mao, but partisanship or bias are not synonyms for dishonesty - they simply require the reader to attach qualifications to the conclusions. We would not discard out of hand a biography of Hitler written by an Auschwitz Jew.    Concerns for the precision of her statistics and conclusions are justified, but only to a point. Discrepancies, such as whether or not the Great Leap Forward killed 30 million or 38 million, do potentially indicate scholarly sloppiness, but myopic focus on C&H's precision only validates Stalin's notation that once you kill enough people, they're only numbers. I'm willing to accept they exaggerated their numbers, but frankly, I don't care. I'm more concerned about a lot of people getting killed than about exactly how many it was.    Ultimately, this book asks you to weigh the benefits of Mao's life by exposing his awesome sins. Exaggerated though some numbers might be, and partisan though the arguments are, to dismiss this portrait of Mao on those grounds only encourages history to repeat itself. I don't disagree with the other reviews that this books neglects the \\"benefits\\" of Mao's reign, but starting down that road is extremely dangerous. By turning analysis of Mao's reign into a cost-benefit analysis between the lives he killed and the lives he raised from poverty or the advances in issues like women's rights, we only make it easier to repeat these mistakes. I am far more comfortable using Mao's biography as a morality tale that damns him unconditionally than I am with utilitarian calculations, however correct or honest those calculations might be. I appreciate the loss in nuance, historical accuracy, and objectivity, but are we really comfortable with the idea that presiding over the deaths of tens of millions of people is ultimately justified if future generations are lifted from poverty?    This is a book with caveats, no doubt, but also a book that makes one think that if you were given one chance to change the course of history, there might be few better choices than wishing Mao was never born.
067003830X|5.0|What a fantastic and absorbing subject, so very well explained and defended by the author.    I believe this book to be a must read for everyone interested in, or subject to, some of the strange and intricate brain disorders we see developing and spreading in Amercian society.    Doctor Doidge has done an excellent job in brining this material to life while breaking down a complex subject into a highly readable format.
B000001F4V|5.0|Most Scorpions classics are here (though don't miss other jewels of their discography as Blackout, Lovedrive, Taken by Force, etc.). Be sure to buy the non-remastered version as it sounds more dynamic and not over-compressed. It won't dissapoint.
0895260131|1.0|Like all of the \\"Politically Incorrect\\" books, this one preaches to the choir of narrow-minded righty types who aren't interested in actually learning anything new, but rather wish to see their agendas affirmed in writing.<br /><br />Typically of these books, quotes are cherry-picked and taken out of context in order to support a predisposition.  Anybody with any intelligence whatsoever can see that this book represents nothing more than the logical fallacy of begging the question.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Hands down you can hate all you want, but you have to admit Kanye is one of the greatest. No one in the game since A Tribe Called Quest has experimented with music the way he has. On the Graduation project it is evident that he will continue to be a trendsetter and hip hop chemist. I love it. As for the people that have posted comments about how this project is not the same as College Dropout, look if everything sound the same all the time music would be boring. Have you ever heard of being diverse and eclectic?
B00000G6NI|5.0|Hey \\"Music Fan, 1999\\" were we at the same show in 1982?!?!? Veteran's Auditorium in Des Moines, Iowa? Rory came out and with his shear energy and frenzied performance brought the house down!!! The day after the show I could hardly wait to get to a, (yeah, I show my age), record store and find those amazing songs: \\"Shin Kicker\\", \\"Brute Force and Ignorance\\", \\"Cloak and Dagger\\", \\" Mississippi Sheiks\\" and please don't forget, \\"Shadow Play\\". Those songs stuck out like a gold vein in the side of a mountain. Simply some of the greatest rock songs I've EVER heard!!! I bought the album and couldn't wait for the CD. Frankly, I could do without the extra tunes on any of the Rory Gallagher reissues. The extended liner notes are great but you can't improve, on what I believe to be, one of the best collections of guitar rockers committed to disk-whether it be vinyl or plastic!!!    Do yourself a favor and purchase this disk of doozies. I wish this Irish-rocker was still around to blow Rush off the stage again. (Hey, I like old Rush so don't hate me too bad.) Sadly, we lost this wonderful gentleman of Rock `n' Roll back in 1995.

1582701709|5.0|Love this book  - totally changed my life's way of thinking for the better - or should I say more Positive????:)
B000RG1FMO|2.0|I believe that this album is a little over-hyped. In the late 90's people jumped all over Puff Daddy for sampling and not being original and rhyming very weak. Now in 2007, we have a new Puff Daddy. Seriously, on every song he samples another song, and then raps weakely on it. What's the difference? On this new album there are some songs that are darn right laughable. I will also admit that there are some good songs on this album as well, but this time around, the bad outweigh the good. I consider this a very average album.

B000B5XOSO|5.0|I got this DVD because of Michelle Pfiefer's performance.  This is by far the best Catwoman movie ever.  This DVD should be renamed to Catwoman because she steals the show.  Tim Burton is a genius, I love the darkness of the movie, it's so edgy.  I love how he got so deep with the Catwoman character and even the Penguin.  You can feel and understand why they are the way they are.  Burton does an outstanding job at getting into the psychology behind all of the characters, right down to the nitty gritty.  While some people may have not liked the dark raw nature of the film, I loved it and it's one of the reasons why I love Batman and Catwoman.  No one ever claimed this movie was meant for little kids.  I really get tired of all of the other cookie cutter carebear superhero movies where everything is hunky dory and the good guy always comes out on top in the end.  No one will ever top the Catwoman performance of Michelle Pfeifer and it is such a shame that the recent Catwoman movie totally destroyed the image of Catwoman.
0446677450|3.0|This book, although a great starting place for people who don't really know what they are doing, I found it to be extremely repetitive to the point where i was frustrated to read it. This book doesn't really give you any insight to the way you should invest. It pretty much gives you a mindset to put your money out there without any guidance as to how. I think the only part worth reading is the last chapter where he offers you 10 helpful steps. ...There are so many other HOW-TO's out there that are actually worth getting your hands on. I suggest you find those first and then if you find Rich Dad, Poor Dad in your local library some where...read it....but please don't waste your money to buy it!!!
031286504X|5.0|Robert Neville is the lone survivor of a vampire plague which has wiped out most of earth's inhabitants. by day he single-handedly stalks the city laying undead to rest. At night he drinks himself into a stupor and listens to classical music. After 5 months alone Robert realizes that some of the legends about vampires are true and begins to seek scientific explanation. With all the time in the world, he reads books from the library and steals an expensive microscope to help him analyze the bacteria in the victims. This book reminds me a lot of Robinson Caruso. At first Neville rails against his loneliness, the vampires and the world in general... Eventually he develops a survivor mentality which allows him to deal with the situation. When Neville finds a dog things begin to look up... Can Robert survive humanity's near extinction or will he become the last survivor of earth's great plague?<br /><br />I read the book in anticipation of the movie in December starring Will Smith. I can't wait to see how this is treated in film. Neville is an interesting character who I took a while to get to like. Mostly because the first 1/4 of the novel he drinks, smokes, and feels sorry for himself (who wouldn't).  I really warmed to the character once the dog arrived... Overall this was a compelling audiobook well narrated and worth a listen.
055358894X|5.0|This is probably the best book I've read in a while. Indeed, it's also one of the few that actually manage to surprise me at points, which is rather hard to do these days.<br /><br />The characters are very well developed, and truly shine throughout the story. Even characters with minimal appearance have unique personalities. All in all, I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories of thieves. This truly outshines most of the ones I've read.
B00005V9IK|5.0|How could anybody give this movie a low rating. The special effects were great. The action was fast moving from the very beginning to the very end. The plot was quite good with many twists. The acting was great. This is a 5 star movie all the way. One you will want to own and watch over and over.<br /><br />Anybody that gave this a low rating does not know what a good movie is. This has everything and then some. A must see.<br /><br />Of all the \\"Aliens Attack Earth\\" movies, I cant think of many as good as this one.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This album is very good from start to finish.  There aren't any little skit here and there which I think is a good thing.  Graduation is great hip-hop all the way through.  Each song has its own mood and melody, giving each and every minute of listening a new and fresh experience.  I do think that this is Kanye's best album to date.  Late Registration wasn't as good as College Dropout, but this one sure is better.  Any fan of hip-hop should give this one a listen to.
0060574909|5.0|I highly recommend this book.   I am a businessman and currently I own two small businesses.  Since originally reading this book years ago I find myself buying copies for friends, associates and one person I just met between flights.  After they read the book they tell me it is as if it was written about them, just as I felt.  Once you get your small business running it is quite difficult to understand how the focus of your effort and your role in the business needs to change.  This book helps you realize what your role should be and how to go about getting there.  If you are like most small businessmen, working to many hours putting out fires instead of guiding the ship, this book will give you real world inspiration and guidance that you can actually apply.    Regards,     Al Johnson Jr -CPMR
0201633612|5.0|Being a total noob to programming, my friend got me into learning about Objective-C and Cocoa. I have bought many books on the subject and I'd like to say that this book helped me with my understanding of objective-c programming language.    Thanks to the authors
B00003BDXG|5.0|I love this contraversial film, it was a real headline runner when it came out. The mixed message from Stone of dream, soap opera, media cirkus is probably more valid today then when it first came out.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|Iced Earth is a very unique band in the world of hard rock and heavy metal. In the mix of the darkness, the growling and praising of satan Jon Schaffer did something different. He decided to tell stories of fantasy, religion and history as well as bring out incredible ensambles of musical talent. Everything from choruses to orchestras and some of the most underrated metal masters.<br /><br /> This time Iced Earth sounds like nothing you have ever heard before. The songs tell an incredible story based on the Something Wicked Trilogy from the 1999 album. But instead of just remastering the songs Jon Schaffer expanded upon the story busts it wide open. The songs mix everything from religion to politics to invasions from extra terrestrial life. It is done only to prove that the wicked in this epic tale is man. Because of the humanity and fear inside our people, we are a race that has alot to understand about ourselved and we need to put our differences aside in order to prevent serious catatistrophic occurences from ever reaching us.<br /><br />Iced Earth has come a along way from their breakout Night of the Stormrider days. Yes there are those that pine for the days of Matt Barlow, but when you hear Framing Armageddon you will be blown away by how much effort was put into making Tim Ownes sound like nothing you have heard. This album is one that will bring dead silence of pure amazment into the room because Iced Earth has never sounded so perfect. If I had my way, Iced Earth would be nominated for a Grammy and win. This new Iced Earth CD will probably give Jon Schaffer the exposure he has wanted for so long and probably reshape the face of Metal as we know it for the better. Let's see if the second instalment of this masterpiece can seal the deal.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|This album is pretty dope...its mos def the winner of the \\"50 vs kayne\\" I only heard one track that wasnt any good...the rest were either decent or Great!!!! Pick this one up...way better then the 50 CD.
B0041G67VU|5.0|I got this movie a week early and I have watched it several times.
B000OTUHNM|5.0|The Little Prince has often been heralded as a youthful book, required reading in elementary and high schools alike. In delivering it this way I think The Little Prince is missed by the only audience that is likely to truly appreciate it, that is adults. It is not an uncommon misconception that this is a children's book. Indeed, I keep the pictures stored on my computer, and am often asked where they came from. I reply that they are from one of my favourite books, and without fail the response is along the lines of, 'I don't mean to be rude but is that a children's book?'. 'No', I explain, 'it is not'.    The Little Prince is most needed, I think, by adults. It is easy to be caught up in, as De Saint-Exupery describes it, 'matters of consequence' and forget that it is not these matters which bring meaning to life. By pointing out the futility of professions practised endlessly and in isolation of other people, it becomes clear that the Little Prince, with his rose, is the only character with a life of consequence.    This book is beautifully written and translated by Katherine Woods. It speaks volumes through its simple tale, strange though it seems that matters such as these only become clear when they are somewhat removed from reality. Matters such as love, innocence, imagination and priorities. The Little Prince is a gentle and stirring reminder to never forget to see the boa constrictor from the hat.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Finally an action movie for those who truly appreciate aesthetics.  The cinematography is absolutely stunning.  The action is fierce and in-your-face.  The story is simple and not really watered down with a stupid love story that gets in the way.  This is a movie that I will watch over and over again for years to come.
B0007MUR2W|5.0|In June of 1972, David Bowie who at the time was known as a one-hit wonder and cult pop star unleashed his most famous record and the one that finally brought him well deserved superstardom. 'The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders of Mars' was the epitome of glam rock and has been called the greatest album of the 1970's although many critics don't even consider this his best record. Regardless for many this became the non-David Bowie fan's key purchase of his entire storied catalogue and definitely made me want to buy more of his records. Like many of rock's greatest LP's it is a joy from start to finish. From the anthemic numbers such as \\"Five Years\\", \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", \\"Moonage Daydream\\", \\"Starman\\", \\"Rock and Roll Suicide\\" and \\"Lady Stardust\\" to the flash rockers \\"Hang on to Yourself\\", \\"Star\\" and \\"Suffragette City\\", 'Ziggy' the album has something for everyone. Loud guitar rock, strings, saxophone jazz and subtle piano melodies help create a most wonderous palate. Many of Bowie's earlier themes such as apocalypse, aliens, supreme beings and insanity have combined with a true genuis of songcraft to bring these motifs to such stirring life. Bowie's right hand man Mick Ronson helped to complete the perfection of sound with his band leadership and stellar guitar. The 'Spiders' may have brought everlasting fame to David but he would soon tire of his creation but after almost two years of lunacy and one more classic album, 'Aladdin Sane'. The bonus tracks are notable, especially \\"Sweet Head\\" which was supposed to be on the original lp release but had to wait 18 years for its debut. Let all the children boogie... wham bam, thank you ma'am ... you're not alone!!
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Don't believe everything you read in these reviews- this is a great DVD!!!!!! Yes, these guys are ALOT older, but man they can still COOK!!!! Clapton is relaxed, and the music just blows you away!!!!!!Think 30 years ago- it's a miracle these guys are still alive much less still cookin'-ENJOY this for what it is!!!!!
073933235X|5.0|I read the book 6 months ago.  I listened to the audio book from Amazon.com last week and loved it all over again.  Bourdain reads it as only he can. He puts the sarcasm and spin on the story as only he can. The Audio book is so much more entertaining when he brings it to life as only he can.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|As someone earlier said in their review on here, Leave it to Kanye to have one of the best, yet disappointing albums of the year. I put Kanye's album just out of my top 5 Hip Hop albums of 2007 (behind Common, Brother Ali, Talib, Pharoahe, Aseop Rock & Luckyiam.PSC...... I know that's 6 so lets say West is 7th). If I say in all of genres of music I would have to put Maroon 5, Linkin Park and Chrisette Michele ahead of him also. Don't Get me wrong, this is still an amazing and very good album. However it is still in my eyes his worst if his three, yet it is again only inches close to topping College Dropout (like Late Registration was). The thing I really like about Kanye is his devotion to concepts for albums and his perfectionist mantality to his music. That probably makes it a little unfair to totally compare his albums side by side, but it is just natural to do that. You can tell he really does love it and put his all into making his albums. I also admire Kanye's willing to change and try new things, something Mainstream Hip Hop lacks immensely. If you look at the different phases in his productions there are many significant changes yet the sound and quality remains.    He started with his work with many artists, most notably Talib Kweli and of course Jay-Z. These were very soulful beats where he perfected his use of voices in his samples, speeding them up often to make that memorable West sound before he had an album out. To this day I still am amazed of Kanye's thought process in hearing 5 to One by the Doors and creating The Takeover. Then came College Dropout. His production here was very Gospel driven and was not as polished in its sound which created a hunger and passion that made this an instant classic. You know an album has a something beyond special when you click on it to just listen to a song or two and end up listening to the whole album. I can't count the amount of times that has happened to me on this album. I thought the skits were funny, but after a couple times hearing them they were rendered useless in my mind, which was my only gripe with the album. Late Registration came and the album was great but just slightly below College Dropout. His sound became a more orchestra oriented sound that was so complex you had to admire the talent behind it. (This was probably his most complicated and difficult sound that he has made) The aspects that stood out to me were a few missteps that his debut didn't have. Celebration and Addictions were the main ones as these \\"OK\\" songs are boring and are 75% of the time skipped by me. Something that is hard for me to do when listening to College Dropout. Also he didnt seem to learn his lesson with the skits, We Major is always turned from after the first 3-4 minutes as it then goes into a long and boring instrumental and on \\"Bring me Down\\" he used the same verse from the track \\"Wack Niggaz\\" with Talib, Cons & Common that was all over mixtapes for the last 2 years before this (it is though a good verse and one of his best). He did make some of his best songs to date on this album. All in all I felt the album was 1/8-1/4 a star lower then his 5 star debut (if that made any sense at all). Then there was Common's Be which was a Dilla-esque sound created by Kanye. He created very soulful beats that really went well with Common's voice and introspective lyrics. The sound also had a pop/old motown feel. Then came what I feel was Kanye's greatest production yet. Common's Finding Forever which was beyond Amazing to me. He was said to try and really capture the brilliance of Dilla from Common's middle albums, I feel he accomplished this but more so created an MF Doom sound. The production was so twisted and creative I was amazed by not only the creative talent, but the balls to make this sound on a follow up to Be. Misunderstood I feel was the pinnacle of that sound and is one of the best beats Kanye has made.    Ok now finally to this album. The sound is a new twist towards electronic, technoish, which kind of mirrors Timbaland's sound. It is a nice change that I was eagerly anticipating to hear the whole album. He took out the skits which I liked but his rapping seemed to take a step back as it was even more hit or miss then his first two (which he will never be as good of a rapper as producer, so don't go in anticipating him to all the suddenly rapp with the best). The main reason's this album is not quite up to par with his old ones (maybe 1/2-3/4 stars less to stay with my weird ranking) is the middle songs Barry Bonds and Drunk Hot Girls and the lack of songs as good as Hey Mama, Roses, Jesus Walks, Gone, Family Business, Diamonds and the remix, All Falls Down, ect. Barry Bonds is an other boring and uninspired track like Addiction and Celebration however it is not backuped with the amazing tracks found on his last 2 albums. Hot Drunk Girls is a nice try but all in all a failed track. The beat is nice but does not go with the song matter. The beat either should have been more upbeat to create a more joking song or the song should have just been changed to match the slow tempo and almost creepy beat (And is it too much to ask for a verse from Mos???). Also all of the songs have a quality to them and there are many great songs on this album (I actually like the Chris Martin song unlike most who say it is a failed experiment) but none seem to capture the essence of his best songs from his first 2 albums.    Despite my seemingly negative review, this is a great album that many people (like the fast falling 50) should take note and study. This is a great album that will be in regular play on my itunes for months to come. Go out and buy (ohhh also because I have a bet with my friend who thinks Kenny Chesney will outsell this album by October). Kanye, keep it up and learn like you seem to always do and someday you may make an album that can be placed directly side by side with  the truly masterpiece Hip Hop albums like Paid in Full, Chronic, People's Instinctive Travels, De la Soul Is Dead, Illmatic, Life After Death and you big brother's albums Reasonable Doubt & Blueprint. Support Creative and positive Hip Hop people!!!
B000301YY8|4.0|His music's great, but beware of the CD version that have the \\"adult lyrics\\" warning on them.  In his biggest hit, \\"You're Beautiful,\\" you'll recall there's a line that goes \\"I was flying high.\\"  In the bad version, it's \\"f*cking\\" high. You can't miss it, because he enunciates the word.  Completely unnecessary in such a beautiful song.  Get the clean (radio) version.
B000VPUIA6|3.0|Everyone knows the film and loves it, that's why we're here checking it out on this page.  But what about this DVD package?  If you look at the price, you have to question is it really worth it.    When I first read about the Deluxe Edition, I thought the price would be around $50 like most other Deluxe Edition DVDs out there.  At $95, this is way too much for what they're offering.  Yes, you get all this:    - a reproduction of Richard Lester s original annotated script    - 8 lobby cards    - poster    - 60-page book with rarely seen photographs and production notes from the movie    ... but unless they are signed by at least one Beatle, I wouldn't pay that much.  Yes, Richard Lester's annotated script is great, but wait awhile and you'll probably find a reproduction online sometime.  The lobby cards and poster are great, but those are not the main reasons for the price inflation.  The 60 page book would seem to be the main reason for the price hike, but look at other Beatles books out there.  The paperback version of The Beatles Anthology has 368 pages, weighs 2.2 pounds, and has over 1,300 photographs.  The price?  LESS THAN A THIRD of what this Deluxe Edition of Help is going for.    Yes, all these extras are nice, but it's not worth the price, and I'm a huge Beatles nut who buys everything they make.  At this moment, I'm going to buy the regular edition which has been restored with great picture and a 5.1 soundtrack.  Plus, the second disk has great extras (could be better if they had Paul or Ringo commenting) that will suffice.  Especially for the price.    Drop the price on this Deluxe Edition, guys.  If you do that, people will buy.
B00005K3O4|3.0|Yes, I should have spelled those with a K but I didn't feel like it. This film is pure 80s, clothing, hairstyles, performances, etc.; even the special effects, although that's a bonus. While some effects are highly cheesy, the Klowns are well-realized and creepy. The cast are intentionally goofy (think of films like the original \\"The Blob\\"), with the exception of the John Vernon who steals the entire film.    Interestingly enough, there were a few scenes in the film that actually gave me the creeps, unlike a lot of contemporary horror. It's bad, but in a good way.     And clowns are scary, let's face it.
6305546789|5.0|I have always been a fan of the Halloween movie series. The original was w/o a doubt a true classic and masterpiece!    I recently saw Rob Zombie's version and was pleasantly surprised that it was pretty good. The Halloween series is the only horror series that I believe had a good story line.    Was that the Boogeyman? As a matter fact it was.
B00000JNO2|3.0|Another major lineup change takes place prior to the recording of this album.  Guitarist Ed King leaves the group and is not replaced leaving the band with only two guitar slingers instead of the three pronged attack that made them famous.  Personally I don't think this album stacks up with the first 3.  All the material is decent and has all of the normal trademark Skynyrd attributes, but the songs in general seem to be a step down for some reason.  The title track was a big hit for the band and opens the album, although it was never one of my personal favorite singles.  The middle of the album is just so so. The last two songs \\"Cry For The Bad Man\\" and \\"All I Can Do Is Write About It\\" end things on a high note however.  The album is notable for somewhat moving in a more country oriented direction which would in turn be the influence for countless country rock bands of today.  Overall this is not a bad Skynard album, but does not rank up with their best either.
6305841861|5.0|Ash is back in this campy,  gorey, horror gem/classic!  If you loved The Evil Dead then you'll love this Hilarious sequel.  This sequel to The Evil Dead takes the mood and tone to a fairly different direction in that it's not quite as gorey or violent as the first and it's pretty darn funny.  I just love that hysterical scene where Ash's hand become possessed and flips him and breaks plates over his head.  I'm really impressed with its higher budget and faster pace.  Best of all for the first time we get to see Ash's chainsaw hand weapon(AWESOME)!  So if you like Sam Raimi Robert Tapert Bruce Campbell or just love a funny action-packed horror movie this one's right up your alley!
0767827791|5.0|Some or all of the on location actual picnicing scenes were shot in Halstead Kansas. There is a metal plaque attached to a flat rock in the city park commemorating the filming there. There is a small river with a falls and a pedestrian bridge crossing the river. There was  a baseball field adjacent the picnic grounds that had high bleachers similar to what Roz and A. O'C. sat upon. I was there about 20 years ago with my brother who was looking for a teaching job in the area. It was a  blistering hot summer day and the park was very empty, dusty and neglected. The plaque looked and felt like a gravestone.It was quite a contrast to the polish and shine that the Hollywood production standards brought-- or maybe 30 years had taken its toll. I felt an odd sense of loss. I knew it was just a movie and that Hal and Madge were hollywood actors making alot of money--- but the illusion of the fictional place and people,----the movie illusion, was pretty powerful. No use looking for Mrs Potts, she'd probably passed on by then.
B00005R24K|4.0|There is no comparison nor contest between this timeless horror classic and any of the trash they now call horror movies!  This movie is truly a moment in time and a step back in time to one incredible golden age for movies.  In other words this movie is awesome!  It's frightening,  It's shocking, It's memorable,  oh and did I say timeless!  I will shred you that the special effects are dated,  the acting's not too good,  and this movie is very gorey and very violent  however that aside you get treated to a unique story with unique characters in a gothic and intriguing atmosphere and you get treated to a story the likes by which have never quite been done before.  Above all else you get to see how a movie can be brilliant, unique, extraordinary, intriguing, and timeless on such a small budget.  In closing dare I say speaking from all of us who already know and embrace this movie \\"Join Us\\"!
B000N3SS80|4.0|Wikipedia states that there is a bonus track on this album called \\"Quien sera\\", the Spanish version of \\"Sway\\" that Melinda Doolittle sang on American Idol 6 earlier this year.  It's not listed in the track list above.  Does anyone have this album and can confirm that it's there before I buy it?
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Absolutely the best pair of headphones for the money. They sound so good, that I've gone back to listening to CDs at home from start to finish, like I'm watching a movie. An amazingly wide spectrum of audio separation, and crystal clear.<br /><br />I also tried these on my iPod, just to see what it would sound like, and you can hear where the MP3s/AACs die and distort at certain peaks when it comes to audio range. That's how clear these are. These are best paired with CD, SACD and DVD audio.
B000002J1O|5.0|I am primarily a Genesis fan from the days when Peter Gabriel was with the band.(The Phil Collins stuff isn't bad either).But this is the last album with Peter and it is PERFECT.Excellent lyrics and music.Also some excellent word play...\\"Me,I'm just a lawnmower you can tell me by the way I walk\\".
B000002J1O|5.0|This is the album that put it all together for me.  The first three had there moments of brilliance but Selling England was great from start to finish.  Steve Hackett works magic on this recording and Gabriels vocals and character are perfect for this music.  My favorite track is Dancing with the Moonlit Knight.  Hacketts noodling here is a precursor to all others today.  This is beautiful symphonic prog with it's mood swings, tempo changes, and melody.  They went on to create more but this is the ultimate.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Here is an all-star tribute to the late Beatle, George Harrison, who died of cancer a few years ago. He was a very gentle, likable guy and you know that just by the turnout of music all- stars here and the tribute these people gave to him - for his life and his music.    After the first viewing, I now skip the first 45 minutes of this long concert. It is Eastern sitar music which is okay but not enjoyable enough for me to sit through twice. The concert for most of us Westerners really begins in the second part when host Eric Clapton and the rest perform some of Hasrrison's best songs. Everyone does a good job with the material, doing George's songs proud. I had heard a few of the performances, such as Tom Petty's, were weak but I did not find fault with any performer including him..     It was fun to see Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, Billy Preston, Jeff Lynne and some of the others. Joe Brown was someone I was not familiar with but he was outstanding and very likable and sang a touching finale. That ending just night bring a tear or two to your eyes.
B0001US8EO|4.0|First off, I'm a nut for movies about Wyatt Earp. From John Ford's [[ASIN:B00005JLUH My Darling Clementine]] to two John Sturges' films [[ASIN:B00008CMR1 Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] & [[ASIN:B0007O393O Hour of the Gun]] to even George Cosmatos' [[ASIN:6304711905 Tombstone]]. It's interesting to see how each film tackles the western legend of honor and vengence. It's also interesting to note that no matter how closer to depicting the actual events the later films, including this one, has gotten, one thing never changes. The Earps are always shown as the good guys and the Clanton/McLaury \\"gang\\" as the outlaws. In truth, the events in Tombstone Arizona in the early 1880's was mostly a turf war. Both sides wanted control of Tombstone for the purpose of making money and both sides were unwilling to compromise. Both groups had the \\"law\\" on their side with the Earps as town Marshalls and Cochise County Sheriff John Behan joining the Clanton/McLaury side.<br /><br />What makes Costner's \\"Wyatt Earp\\" unique to all the other films is for the first time we see the early life of Wyatt. We see him as a happy-go-lucky young man in awe of all that is around him. We get to see the tragedy of the death of his first wife and how it effected him. And we see him turn into the cold, stubborn person he became. Costner does a good job in his portrayal of Earp and the filming of the movie is outstanding. And for one of the first times that I know of, we see the character of Jame Earp portrayed. In most, if not all, other films it's mostly Wyatt, Virgil & Morgan, although \\"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\\" did have a small part of a younger Earp (Warren?) who ends up getting killed early on.<br /><br />On the character of Doc Holiday, it's my opinion that Dennis Quaid here has done the best job at portaying and sick, surly, and almost suicidal drunkard & killer that Holiday is know to have been. His one redeeming quality is his loyalty to Wyatt. A close second is Victor Mature in the mostly fictional \\"My Darling Clementine.\\"<br /><br />Some of the downsides to this movie: It's long, too long. I understand it's an epic but there are times when certain scenes have a filler feel to them, just not necessary. The music is pretty forgettable. And the character of Josie, played by Joanna Going, is not very compelling. The actress does a decent job but in comparing her to, say, Dana Delany in Tombstone, she's just not the force that you can imagine grabbing Wyatt's affection after all the years of hiding behind his sorrow.<br /><br />All-in-All, a decent film, worth watching. I would recommend it to any western fan and any Costner fan. Maybe not as good as his western [[ASIN:B0000TANUI Open Range]] but believe me, much better that most of his other offerings.rling Clementine.\\"    Some of the downsides to this movie: It's long, too long.

B000G8NY4U|5.0|Well, I certainly waited a long time for this! I expected this DVD out around 2000 since the first concert tape was out n 1994 and the second in 1997. Then, after attending one of his concerts in 2003, I thought that a DVD would be our for sure but the wait continued until late 2006.    Most of the songs, thankfully, are new material. How much other new stuff I heard in the three-hour Buffalo concert I attended that wasn't on this DVD, I don't know but I'm not complaining. There are a couple of surprises in here, such as two solo violinists, a dulcimer player, and a flashy harpist-singer. A shock was not seeing violinist Karen Briggs on this DVD. She had  always been a staple in Yanni's tour concerts in the past 10 years and - next to the Yanni himself - the key performer and most recognizable one in past DVDs.    However, Sayaka Katsuki, from Japan, who replaced her, is just fine. Katsuki and Armenian violinist Samvel Yervinyan make a dynamite duo, with the Russian being the best of the two, I think. He is fantastic. Both of them do a number of solos..    The most versatile and best musician in the entire band is Pedro Eustache, who was with Yanni in his 1997 concert in China and India. He is still animated, talented and fun to watch. You can tell he's Yanni's right-hand man. Not far behind is keyboard player Ming Freeman, another holdover from the China concert.    Of the new songs, the driving-beat, fast selections seem to be the best and generate the most enthusiasm among the crowd.  Songs such as \\"Rainmaker,\\" \\"On Sacred Ground,\\" \\"Playtime,\\" \\"For All Seasons\\" and \\"World Dance\\" will all have you tapping your feet, moving your hands, etc. They are great feel-good songs and perhaps the trademark of these Yanni Orchestra presentation. Of the older songs, the re-make of \\"Nostalgia\\" was tremendous, thanks to the added dramatic violin work of Yervinyan.    This is just a fabulous concert, filmed in Las ?egas sometime, I think, in 2005. I watched this 7-8 times the first two months I owned it and loved it more and more each time. I just hope the next Yanni DVD doesn't take another 9-plus years to be released.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|They said it was more rock than Rap Rock, so what the heck, I'm a rock and roll person so let's pre-order it, if from LP so how can I go wrong? Wrong! Be warned this is not the Linkin' Park you know and love. This is totally different and not in a good way. I love rock and roll but this ain't it! I had high hopes for rock and roll from LP but I am so disappointed. LP, get back to what you did in your first two CDs.     Save your money, don't buy this CD. I played this CD a dozen times or more but it just doesn't cut it. it's now collecting dust at the bottom of my CD pile.
B000HT386M|4.0|This was a funny and - near the end - a touching movie. That's a nice combination to have. My only complaint is that it certainly isn't \\"family fare\\" for a nice story and should have been rated \\"R,\\" not PG-13. There's simply too much sexual material (and and f-word) for PG-13. With some editing, this could have been a great story for everyone.    However, for us adults who like to laugh, there is plenty in here to do that. The jokes come pretty fast, right from the get-go. The premise would good: with a (television-like) remote control, you could control your life. You could fast-forward through all the unpleasant scenes in your life, or freeze frame something that is happening now, or you could go back into time with your life. It all sounds good, but as our main character \\"Michael Newman\\" (Adam Sandler) found out, it's not so cool. That's a key message here, too, that avoiding the bad things is not necessarily what's best for us. The major message, however, was that spending time with your family is more important than putting your job ahead of them, as far as priorities go.     That theme leads to some touching scenes in the final 30 minutes of this comedy. As funny as this film is, you would be hard-pressed not to have some tears in your eyes at some point near the end of this film.

B000GFLKF8|4.0|Here's a heist-negotiator story done with a few different angles.  Among the \\"twists\\" are (1) a bank president who hires someone to try to get something NOT robbed out of his band during the heist, evidence that could destroy his status and career, and (2) the crooks all get away with the mastermind of group hiding in the bank for a week before slipping away in broad daylight. That last part leads me to ask a few questions about that could possibly happen, specifically how get could get out of the vault where he was hidden without all kinds of alarms going off, etc.    Nevertheless, credibility-aside, its an interesting two hours of entertainment, sort of a modern-day Dog Day Afternoon film. (In fact, DDA is mentioned in the movie.)    The four lead actors in this film are all quite diverse: a veteran cop (Denzel Washington), the main crook (Clive Owen), the bank president (Christopher Plummer) and the professional business woman he hires (Jodie Foster.) All of them are fascinating, thanks in large part to the fact they are all outstanding actors to begin with. Unlike most people, I particularly enjoyed Foster playing such a controlled, low-key character and the same could be said about another top actor in here: Willem DaFoe.     The more I think about it, the actors here are just as fascinating as the story, if not more so. I am sure it will be them, not the story, that drives me back for more viewings.  One warning for families: there are lots of f-words in here.
0061142026|4.0|I'm familiar with Gaiman's work, but this was the first of his solo novels I've read (I read Good Omens, which he did with Terry Pratchett) and I was pleasently surprised.<br /><br />I saw the film version first and was surprised (well, not really) to find that the film version differs greatly from the book. But both are enjoyable in their own ways (I have a feeling the changes for the film were made to cater to the American audience).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, it has a great mix of humor, myth, and fairy tale fun.
185984054X|4.0|there has been a renewal of interest in Mother Teresa recently, what with the tenth anniversary of her death and the publication of her private letters. with all the high words of praise that are bandied about, it seems important to consider the beliefs and actions of the woman.  there has been very little focus on what she believed in, besides helping 'the poorest of the poor.'  this book may be obviously skewed to a particular point of view (aka an atheist one), but it does look at what she actually did. it also considers the opinions of people who worked directly with the nun and her organization and had a less than rosy picture of what her institutions were like.  there are some aspects of her life that are extremely contradictory - I think especially of the tremendous efforts that went into treating her as her health deteriorated in her old age, compared to the refusal of basic treatments to patients in her clinics - and I think that the Catholic Church should consider carefully before elevating her to the status of sainthood. Mother Teresa was a reactionary, and there's no other way to look at it.  Her almost fanatical opposition to abortion, or indeed any form of birth control, was evidenced in the speech that she gave when accepting her nobel peace prize (I still don't quite understand why she received it).  The reluctance with which useful treatment is employed in her clinics is (to my mind) ridiculous.  God may want us to suffer, but does God really want us to die of an easily cured disease?  perhaps most damaging to her reputation is the evidence of tremendous amounts of monetary gifts which her organization has received over the years, yet the apparent lack of use to which this money is put. if needles are used in her clinics even after they are dull, where is the money going?  I would never imply that she would have used such money in an immoral way, but it does seem that it hasn't been utilized as fully as it could have been, at least during her lifetime.  one final note involves the personal letters which were published so recently.  Mother Teresa mourns that she had to live so long without the presence of Jesus, and notes that if she ever became a saint it would be as a saint of darkness. I thought that being a saint meant you wouldn't think that you could become a saint. isn't this a sign of hubris that is inappropriate in a candidate for sainthood?
0156030322|2.0|I've read a few noir-like novels in the past but only James Sallis' 158-page murder novella DRIVE qualifies as true noir. It's psychologically twisted, it's erratically nonlinear, and big on the style rather than the plotting. I think a murder noir like DRIVE is worth reading once, and the short 2,3-page chapters realizes a quick read. The novella lacks a chronological flow and chapters jump erratically to different times and locales in Driver's life. The excursive prose equals the novella's dark, nonlinear intensity while the book mostly follows Driver's transition from a movie stunt driver to cold-blooded killer. Remarkably, DRIVE is extremely light on violence and language.    The Premise.    Since it's tough to describe such an erratically nonlinear murder noir such as DRIVE, this is going to be brief. We pick up the story in middle as we read about Driver in a hotel bedroom strewn with three dead bodies. From various flashbacks both from his childhood and from a more recent time period, the rest of the novel shows how the scene in the opening chapter comes to pass. We discover that Driver is a stunt driver for movies, and later, he's drawn into small-time \\"jobs\\" requiring good drivers. Driver earns a formidable reputation as a driver, he's the best at what he does, and everyone knows it. Driver doesn't want to know anything about the small-time \\"jobs\\" and he expects people to follow through on their ends of the deal. A betrayal from a driving job goes terribly astray and Driver coldly retaliates.    Driver expects people to hold up their end of the bargain as long as he holds up his end driving people and things in and out of discordant circumstances. When they don't hold up their end of the bargain, Driver methodically exacts his vengeance.    Because of the detached persona of its main character Driver and the nonlinear pacing, the book never really grips. Still, it was interesting to see a simple, humble stunt car driver transition into a cold-blooded murderer. Doesn't get any darker than this.
0743486285|5.0|By Rev. John of <a href=\\"[...]\\">PC LIVE!</a>    One of the most memorable moments from VH-1's \\"Behind the Music\\" was Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx telling the story of his outer body experience. He had just overdosed, was presumed dead, yet revived at the last minute...and he saw all this from above. What BTM doesn't tell you was that Slash from Guns n' Roses was with him at the time. It doesn't tell you of the chaos amongst his bandmates wondering if he was alive or not. It also doesn't tell you the depression and drug addiction that haunted Sixx in the year preceding this most recent overdose. These are all some of the things Nikki shares with gruesome detail in \\"The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rockstar.\\"    \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" is a journal Nikki started on Christmas Day 1986 to, among other reasons, remember what he did the day before. This was a fascinating entry point for me personally because it was right before the writing and recording of the \\"Girls, Girls, Girls,\\" album and was my introduction to Motley Crue. Twelve year old me looked at Motley as the coolest band on the planet, and even planned to use \\"Wild Side\\" when I made my debut as a pro wrestler (don't laugh, I was twelve). Thirty-two year old me was surprised to read just how depressed and suicidal Nikki was at the time.    I was even more surprised to read that \\"Wild Side\\" was actually a bastardization of The Lord's Prayer, and inspired by his friend's daughter, a seventeen year old Catholic school girl who used to stop by between classes for reasons that had nothing to do with prayer (though, she may have still been on her knees).    <!--more-->The twenty year difference between when you first discovered the band and reading \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" now is the most interesting aspect of the book. As a kid growing up in the 80's, \\"Shout at the Devil\\" back patch in all, The Crue were gods. They rocked. They partied. They had all the girls. This was the life you wanted to live. This was what it was all about.    Who knew that, while we were idolizing the man, Nikki Sixx was sitting on the floor in the closet in his bedroom, alone, shooting up as much heroin as he could get his hands on and wanting to die? The lifestyle we all grew up wanting as teenagers suddenly stopped looking so glamorous. It actually looks pretty sad.    That was 1987 for Nikki Sixx. Throughout the recording and touring of \\"Girls, Girls, Girls,\\" that was his life. Save for fifteen days in May when he was clean and sober (except for the alcohol and the cocaine), it was doing as much drugs as he needed too just to make it through the day. There was still the debauchery you would expect; he was a rockstar after all. But at the end of the day there was just a junkie all alone, both physically and emotionally.    The \\"Diaries\\" weren't all about the drugs. Nikki also went into his feelings about the recording industry, all the other bands that were biting off of Motley's style, his management, and even his bandmates. I also had no idea that Slash was a friend of his from before \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" was released. There was a day in August when Axl Rose had actually called Nikki to tell him that Slash was all \\"strung out\\" and wanted to know if Nikki could help him or say something to him. Think about that one.    If it sounds like I'm down on him, I'm not. I'm still a Motley Crue fan, and even more so of Nikki personally. Even when you strip away all the bells and whistles that go along with being one of the biggest bands in the world, there's a guy who remains passionate about what he does, and more importantly, remains passionate about music.    But he didn't publish these diaries to say \\"look at me and look how cool it was to be in Motley Crue.\\" He published them for the future rockers and/or junkies as a guide book of what not to do. He's been there and done that. He knows all the excuses and he knows all the tricks. He's also lucky to be alive. \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" ishis way of telling people not to make the same mistakes.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Zep fans knew Pagey had this kind of quality in the vaults, but old Led Wallet made us wait. Well worth it, though; this is one of the great music dvds. Killer remastered sound, excellent footage, and in general the kind of quality you expect from one of rock's most passionate bands.<br /><br />The first dvd is solid, but the second has most of the gems. If a spaceman showed up and said, \\"what is rock and roll?\\", I'd put on The Ocean, an outtake from the MSG 1973 shows that made up the Song Remains The Same film/album. It's smokin' hot. Page's tone is molten, Plant could still hit every high note, and Jones always laid down strong and funky lines.<br /><br />Bonzo once again proves that he was rock's ultimate drummer, with all the weight and bombast and monster groove as well as a surprisingly agile shuffle and sense of feel. Fool In The Rain on Out Door exemplifies that. Here on the dvd, we see his live power that made the other three members step up and hit it out of the park night after night.<br /><br />The acoustic numbers in the middle of disc two show why no other group will ever touch the Zep for breadth of emotion and material; no one else has ever rocked this hard and yet also been so delicate. These guys could really play their asses off and their hearts out.<br /><br />If you're new to live Zep, make sure to join the yahoo group that trades live shows. Zep heads were notoriously selfish about not sharing shows for decades, but now that the zep is out of the bag most of the great shows are available for free/trade. Look around online a bit. Their best live shows are insanely good, as this dvd demonstrates. Even their last big set at Knebworth featured the excellent versions of Kashmir and Achilles on the second dvd.<br /><br />They just announced their reunion today for the Ertegun tribute; let's hope it erases memories of their pathetic Live Aid dribble-fest.<br /><br />The kids in your high school parking lot in the 70s were right after all; Zep is still untouchable.
055299703X|5.0|Bryson's dry wit and way of looking at himself and the world are inspiring and if you get the humor laugh out loud funny, so if you are planning a trip to Australia by all means read this book first, but understand that it's not really a book about traveling in Australia.  Bryson is there to get to know the real Australia, he misses the icons of the country completely.  The trips that he writes about are visiting friends or wandering the little traveled roads that even few Aussies have.    But you will gain an insight into the soul of Australians, something that will sound very familiar to Americans as their history is so similar to our own, which is probably why we love Australians and more often than not they love us.  And after having read the book, if you want to go to Australia and retrace his footsteps and see an Australia that we Americans just miss, we'll, as they say down under, \\"good on ya\\".
B000023VR6|5.0|After nearly a decade-long wait, fans of West-Coast hip-hop were finally satisfied in late 1999 when Dr. Dre released Chronic 2001, the smash sequel to The Chronic (1992).  Dre includes so many guests on the album that many critics were quick to write this album off as a shoddy collaboration.  How wrong they were!  With a guest lineup including Hitman, Kurupt, Eminem, Xzibit, and Snoop Dogg (among several others), Dre ensures that any song he creates on the album is premier.     Some of the best songs on the track are \\"Xxplosive,\\" with Nate Dogg, \\"The Next Episode,\\" with Snoop Dogg, and \\"The Message,\\" featuring stunning vocals by Mary J. Blige.  Even the skit tracks are entertaining and help create a seamless flow when listening to the entire album from beginning to end.  \\"Pause for Porno\\" is probably the goofiest skit, featuring Jake Steed in a menoge` trois with two girls.  The funniest, without a doubt is \\"Ed-Ucation,\\" featuring Eddie Griffith lecturing on the \\"biggest hoes on planet Earth.\\"     As far as the content, Dre touches on a variety of subjects familiar to listeners of his earlier albums and listeners of West Coast hip-hop in general.  On \\"Forgot About Dre,\\" featuring Eminem (whom Dre discovered and created), Dre lashes out at those who have bashed him during the `90s and stands his ground as the premier \\"Doctor\\" of hip-hop.  \\"Murder Ink\\" is a dark track about the gangster assasins of Los Angeles.  \\"The Message\\" is a spiritual track in which Dre mourns and remembers his late brother.     Dre proves yet again why he is the uncontested \\"Doctor\\" of West-Coast hip-hop, with a disc full of quality tracks, blazin' beats and an all-star guest cast.  There are virtually no filler tracks on the album, and it is a great listen as both primary entertainment or background accompanyment.  Hip-hop fans who don't have this disc in their collections are missing out!
B000P2A24W|5.0|After all these years some would think Bon Jovi would get old (sounding).  This album is just as young and refreshing as Slippery When Wet (without the long hair).  Jon's vocal's are as great as ever, and the band seriously gets better with age (don't we all).  I really like the way they included Leanne Rimes, they are really having more of a Nashville feel without actually being labeled as \\"country\\"  I really liked this whole album, it's great to see them still having fun and not compromising on their music.
0393312836|5.0|Even though I knew this was supposed to be one of those \\"must be read in your lifetime\\" kind of books, I was always hesitant to pick it up due to the violence I knew lurked between the covers.  Not because I feared it, but because I could never quite find the right \\"mood\\" to tolerate it (especially with the newspaper, Kiterunner and such one picks up these days!)  However, the book came highly recommended (mostly by men, including the 30-something librarian who I checked it out from: \\"oh, you're going to love it!\\" I don't know how he knew, but he was right).  I finally cracked the cover.<br /><br />Lo and behold, what indiscernible argo did I discover on the first page! For such a short book, I told myself, this would be a long read.  After two or three pages of the futuristic, Russian-based slang I found that, like reading Shakespeare, the reader adjusts to the rhythm of the language.  It did not prevent the story from absorbing me, and I didn't need to know the definition of every word to grasp the meaning.<br /><br />Alex, the charming teenage sociopath narrator, spends the first third of the book inciting nightly acts of \\"ultraviolence\\" with his hooligan friends.  In the second part, he is caught, punished, and rehabilitated.  In the third, he must deal with the consequences of his violent past, and his present as a man who can no longer defend himself from them.  Although written in the 60's, it's hard not picture a 1980's London backdrop complete with the punks and hooligans bringing anarchy in an alternate socialist dystopia.<br /><br />A quick word on the violence.  Although the narrator gleefully partakes in some terrible actions, his use of slang to describe it actually keeps it rather slapstick and prevents it from becoming overly graphic (like Fightclub, for instance).  What I didn't expect at all was the humor.  Some of Alex's observations are riotously funny.  I even got a few strange looks while reading in public, either because I laughed too loudly, or reacted to Alex's deepening predicament with an \\"aah!\\"--a pretty good sign that I'm captivated.  This says something about the skill of the writer, that he had me empathizing with (if not exactly rooting for) a depraved character who I had no business liking under normal circumstances.<br /><br />The only thing that didn't quite sit with me was the inconsistent (yet original) 21st chapter.  Some say this ends the novel on a lighter, more hopeful note.  I don't think it needed to.  Without giving too much away, what Alex hints at maturing into was, to me, far more terrifying than his old hooligan self. Especially seeing how the other adults in this book, including his parents, have turned out in this fictional future.  Give me the other, albeit more sinister, end.pening predicament with an \\"aah!\\"--a pretty good sign that I'm captivated.

B000IONJH4|3.0|OK the title pretty much says it all. I have always been a fan of this movie but I expected a lot more out of it for a HD-DVD release. The video quality was pretty much the same as the original, none of the graphics were enhanced, and it was other than being made to fit in HD resolutions without issue nothing else was done to the film.<br /><br />All the blotches that were present on the original film were left and show excessively in the opening credits. The graphics looked entirely untouched. There was, in some scenes, strong evidence of grain present in the film.<br /><br />The only reason I give this movie 3 stars is because it's DUNE, if it were any other title I would have received much less. I would have thought they would have taken a little more care in releasing this movie for HD but apparently I was wrong. You might as well just pick up the original DVD as with a HD player or up scaling DVD player you will pretty much have about the same quality as this HD-DVD. Yes this movie was up scaled on the HD-DVD to have HD resolution of 1080p but the film went untouched. All the original blemishes and dirt are visible throughout the entire movie. I was rather disappointed that they did not clean the film up in any way. I was ok with the fact that the computer generated graphics were untouched as that wasn't all that big of a deal to me, as that is what made the movie what it was, but I could have really done without the large amount of dust, dirt, and general bad spots on the original film that really do not effect the film in a good way at High Definition levels.<br /><br />Why would you re-release a film, which was revered as one of the founding science fiction movies (IMO), with such poor quality for the new generation of video equipment? I don't think I will understand this one any time soon. I hope some one takes the hint and starts working on fixing this film so it can be revived the way it should have been.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|In the eighties, the comedy genre assailed with strength invective around the world, (The meaning of life, Brazil, Consuming passions, Buffet froid Choose me) specially during the middle years. And \\"Big\\"  not only smartly innovated the proposal around the always disturbing question: what if you or me had the chance to return over our vanished youthful? But answered and cleverly responded as a joke. As you may realize, a considerable number of Fellini works (Amarcord, The clowns)turned around this aspect.<br /><br />But the touch of genius of the screenwriters was to employ two well defined ages (adult and son and exchange them); allowing to express a duality with the expected tangles of the case.<br /><br />And if we scrutinize with detail, we should cite this celebrated film as the second most original comedy of the eighties,  because of the fact Zelig was much more audacious, irreverent and loaded of major sardonic intentions.<br /><br />Big will be probably an obligated reference pattern for many filmmakers that really want to risk and bet for this risked genre.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|I don't think Cage could disappoint in a movie, out of all the movies I've seen him in he has yet to play a poor role. I have seen every movie he's been in and even though there are some disturbing ones (8mm) he has never done a poor job. This was a rather interesting movie for the topic and well put together script but I think the fact that cage was the lead he made the movie what it is. What it is would be a great movie hands down.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes good action and a little intrigue mixed together.

B000ICM5VW|5.0|This is really two movies in one if you ask me, there is the original King Kong in New York but then there was the addition of were he came from in the beginning.<br /><br />This movie was probably the longest I've watched in many years but well worth the time invested. They managed to keep you on the edge in many parts while relaxing a little in others. My family actually stayed awake through the whole thing, this is a first in a long time as well. For a new version of a classic it really did the original justice and then some. It could have been easily split into 2 parts but was well worth leaving it as one as well.<br /><br />Even though it's long I'm sure I'll be glad to watch this a few more times, though I'll have to make sure that I only do so on days that I know I will have the 3+ hour to sit around and do nothing. I think this a good bi-yearly video.<br /><br />VIDEO QUALITY was just remarkably outstanding throughout the entire film! I don't think there was one scene that was not simply outstanding as far as quality goes.
1401207928|5.0|We are closing in on the 20th anniversary of this wonderful work. Written in1988, and placed 10 years in the futures, \\"V for Vendetta\\" is a story of a world torn apart by global war and controlled by fascism and technology. Into this dystopic universe comes a mysterious figure - dressed ludicrously as a 17th century dandy with thigh-high boots, page-boy-style wig and an ever-smiling ceramic mask. Calling himself \\"V,\\" the hero is a difficult figure. Standing for good, he is brutally violent. Standing for freedom, he imprisons. Standing for free will, he manipulates and holds secrets. V is a master schemer who slips effortlessly through the cracks of his world, trying to wake up the population to oppose the tyranny that provides them comfort and security.<br /><br />\\"V for Vendetta\\" is a complex work, and hard to understand on the first pass. There are at least a dozen main characters, some of whom age and grow over the course of the book. The comic book style was never one for subtlety, and I found it hard to recognize the characters from page to page. Yet I was unwilling to slow down to get my bearings. A second reading will be needed to straighten out al the characters and their relationships but it will be a pleasure to put in he work.<br /><br />\\"V\\" maintains a very fast pace. Every page explodes with new twists, new surprises and new energy. The book is quite violent, with bombings and shootings throughout. There is a small amount of nudity, and several scenes from a \\"girlie\\" dance review, but these fit the story line and aren't completely gratuitous. A dictatorship that thrives on controlling its populace would not stint at \\"merely\\" exploiting its women.<br /><br />\\"V\\" is terrific. Its hero is complicated, yet always courageous and cunning. Its values lie on the right side of the divide of tyranny versus freedom, its message is timeless and its delivery is superb. A must-read.

I was hoping for a different ending though.
0765340798|4.0|This is the last of a trilogy (Legends of Dune) that sets the stage for many of the key elements in the original Dune series. I read the first book (The Butlerian Jihad) in early 2005 and the second book (The Machine Crusade) in late 2006. I've also read the first two \\"house\\" prequels (House Atriedes and House Harkonnen) but I don't think that series is as good as this one.<br /><br />These are huge books (actually did them all on audio about 22 CDs each) but I can honestly say that I don't remember being bored at all while reading (listening to) them. In this trilogy you get the origins of the Mentat's, Suk Doctors, Spacing Guild, Swordmasters, the Atriedes-Harkonnen blood feud and the Bene Gessert!<br /><br />Many reviewers have skewered these books but really that is so predictable. If you want to read -Dune- then read -Dune-, don't pick up the author's son's attempt to recreate the magic with a chip on your shoulder ready to hate it. If you don't want to like it then you won't.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say about this last book is that some of the origin stories were kind of crammed in at the end.<br /><br />Also Vorien's reaction to Abelard's attempt to save the hostages at the end didn't really ring true to me. It seems like Vorien would have mellowed out after everything was over and forgiven him but they need him to hate Abelard so that they could start the Atriedes-harkonnen feud.

One of the great movie classics.
0316067598|5.0|Marcus Luttrell writes like a military guy, not like an author.  His story is sad and inspiring, mesmorizing and thought provoking.   I am so proud that Marcus survived so that the rest of the world can understand the sacrifice our military men and women make each and every day of their lives.    This book is fast and frought with just enough detail to take the reader to that place in time.I found myself cheering, crying and wringing in sweat as I read along.    If you want a little piece of what it is like to be a military fighting man read this.  You, like I will want to somehow reach out to Marcus and thank him for his service.  If, after you read this and you don't know Marcus Lutterll, find another service member and thank them for their service.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This album is another unique classic from Kanye West.  It might not top Late Registration, but it comes close.   One thing I'm tired of hearing about is how Kanye is a below average rapper.  Are you kidding me?  He uses creative metaphors and rhymes with humor and confidence that always bring a smile to my face.  For example, \\"Heard you'd do anything for a klondike, well I'd do anything for a blonde dike.\\"    Everytime I replay a song, I get something new from his lyrics.  Would you rather hear the same crap about guns and money that every other rapper writes about?  It's funny to me how 50 Cent even thinks there is a competition between his \\"Curtis\\" and this album.    \\"Graduation\\" will win the grammy for Rap Album of the Year.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I have shown this to a few of my friends and have recieved split opinion.  The ones who did not like it are the ones who zoned out at the first scene from its 'explicitness'.   Basically, if you like independant cinema and you are not over sensitive you should appreciate this film.   I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Here are some of the reasons.  - Coherent and fluid storyline  - An excellent and suitable soundtrack  - Great performance from sook yin lee  - The movie was not self conscious
0316067598|5.0|This is why we are all safe here at home in the United States of America- we are protected by the most heroic men on earth. Indeed, these selfless group of warriors seek no special recognition, just support from the American people. One special fact not readily known, is that there are a large group of Tribal people in Afghanistan who are opposed to the Taliban, and risked their lives to save the author. I strongly recommend this book for all who wish to know more about this theater of the War on Terror, which is largely overshadowed by the military involvement in Iraq.
B00005JLCI|4.0|Im a huge fan of KB. He made shakespeare real, brought meaning to the dialog in a way that no other actor has or perhaps will. Henry V is the finest on screen portrayal of a any shakespearean play. I adored Hamlet, but I felt it was slightly OTT, vaudevillian and camp. However, I hate to be critical of a piece that reaches for perfection. Mel Gibson's Hamlet was in my opinion much better in terms of the complete piece (although KB's own portrayal is on a different level) and more compelling a movie.
B000002KMY|5.0|\\"The Mob Rules\\" is another Dio Era classic and all time heavy metal classic. The CD opens up with the blistering, fast paced and heavy \\"Turn up the Night\\". Iommi's riffs and solos are incredible on this track. Appice's drum work is fantastic. The next song \\"Voodoo\\" is a slow paced, evil, and menacing track which is a classic. Next, \\"The Sign of the Southern Cross\\" is probably one of Sabbath's greatest songs. It starts with great acoustic guitar by Iommi and melodic vocals from Dio and then launches into a powerful and evil riff worthy of any Sabbath era. Next, is the technical instrumental \\"E5150\\" which is nothing but a prelude to the fast paced, Sabbath classic \\"The Mob Rules\\". This is another song with blistering guitar work from Iommi and absolutely great vocals from Dio.Dio can belt out a scream that is the finest in heavy metal.    Next we have \\"Country Girl\\" a great song with a catchy riff. We move onto \\"Slipping Away\\" ,a great, but overlooked song with some really great bass guitar from Geezer Butler. \\"Falling off the Edge of the World\\" is next. This is another classic. It starts off slow and then builds up into a fast paced tune. Dio's vocals are just fantastic. Last is the sad and melodic \\"Over and Over\\", not a classic, but a great song  nonetheless.    Overall, this is a classic metal CD. If you love metal, Sabbath, get this CD! This is another example of Black Sabbath at their finest, with, in my opinion, their finest lineup!
B0000242AD|5.0|Electronic power pop that sounds fresh to this day. The beats are more bubblegum punk than straight-up dance music. The songs have hooks the Archies would kill for: Catchy, and completely addictive. You can bet your modern day synthpop bands like Ladytron, Freezepop, Hyperbubble, and Bis listened to this stuff in their sleep. Many say it's Depeche Mode at their best, many disagree. Whatever the case, there's no other DM album like it, and every song is great. If you eat this electrocandy up and want more, there are a few more Speak and Spell moments on DM's second album.<br /> Comment   Why no voting buttons?

B000SQJ2SC|5.0|The most impressive thing about the latest album from Kanye West is it's ability to distinguish itself from it's previous counterparts.     \\"Graduation\\", the assumed final piece in West's school-themed artistic endeavours, draws much of it's potent lyrical & musical prowess from the artist's own struggles with how he's perceived within the music industry. While standout hits such as \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Good Life\\" are surefire chart toppers, songs such as \\"Everything I Am\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" reflect West's own struggles with trying to be appretiative (not upset over not winning all the awards) of his influencial position within the music industry.      With such variety and range being presented on this album, Kanye West has once again positioned himself in the running for the much coveted Album of the Year award at the 2008 Grammy Awards. The major difference between \\"Graduation\\" and his previous efforts is that his best songs lack the extremely overused musical tool, the collaboration. Kanye West has in the vast majority of cases, developed songs which have been assembled, produced, and performed solely by West himself. For the times that he does use the collaborative genius of another artist, he is capable of stretching the boundaries and encorporating individuals such as Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin, a lesson he learned in his previous album with Maroon 5's Adam Levine.     All in all, Kanye West has created an individualisitic musical journey on the \\"Graduation\\" effort and quite possibly may earn that award which has eluded him for so long.

B000RG1FMO|4.0|This album provides a handful of instant Kanye classics, but does not live up to the usual hype that Kanye builds before he drops an album.  This album will undoubtedly surpass 50 Cent's Curtis in their album war, on lyrical content alone without even considering the impressive production from track to track.  The opening is solid, giving you a vibe for the rest of the album, and \\"Champion\\" is very fun and high-tempo with a catchy sample interlaced.  \\"Stronger\\" is one of my favorite Kanye tracks, with the biggest hook he's ever used, coming from a sample of Daft Punk.  This is a club track that translates into your car with no problem.<br /><br />Some of the tracks in the middle are more gritty and hip hop oriented, which works very well with the guests he uses on them.  \\"Barry Bonds\\" features Lil Wayne and \\"Good Life\\" features T-Pain, both great tracks with excellent beats and hooks.  \\"Cant Tell Me Nothing\\" was the street single before he gave us \\"Stronger\\" and is not one of my favorite tracks.  \\"Flashing Lights\\" is a great track, with a \\"flashy\\" instrumental backing a track about the finer things.  The real standout is \\"Homecoming\\" with Coldplay's Chris Martin.  Chris was on a Kanye produced track called \\"Beach Chair\\" on Jay Z's comeback album Kingdom Come and it's obvious that he's capable of providing a memorable track but prefer this track of the two.  Overall, I think this album is an achievement for Kanye who doesn't rely on huge names to carry his album, but to add to what he already brings to the table, lyrically.
B000001ELR|4.0|During their illustrious 30-plus year career, KISS has stumbled on occasion. Dynasty,Unmasked and The Elder are examples of such a toe-stubbing for the original line-up [well atleast the official, original lineup].  Non makeup KISS stumbled a few times as well [Hot In The Shade, Crazy Nights] but each time they came back harder and better than before. While REVENGE [one of KISS' best albums ever-certainly the best non-makeup outing] stands as the re-defining CD of the non-makeup KISS, this CD does the same for the face paint KISS. This album rocks from start to finish.   The title track, War Machine, I Love It Loud all hit you square between the eyes. This is a great CD, but unfortunately came as \\"a little too little, a little too late- after the less than stellar showings of Dynasty and Unmasked. Alot of fans had given up on KISS by the time this album was released. I'm sure most of them came back to the rank and file of the KISS Army later and then discovered this gem. Paul Stanley gives a great vocal performance throughout, especially on \\"I Still Love You\\", and Gene's contributions to this recording are some of his strongest ever. This album marked the recording studio debut of Vinnie Vincent, who must be given some credit for his role in revitalizing KISS.  Add to the mix the rib cage rattling drumming of the late GREAT Eric Carr and you have a hard rock album that only gets better with age.
B00006AW2M|4.0|This is easily the Stones' most-maligned album, but it's nice to see some people realize that it's not that bad after all. The parallels with Sgt. Pepper's are inevitable- mind expansion (OK, drugs), Eastern influences, and some very silly costumes. But while the Beatles could never go back to being the agreeable moptop chaps after Sgt. Pepper's, I think the Stones were stung by the criticism of this record and by contrast became a bit more conservative in their approach. 'See What Happens' is one of those tracks you wish you could delete from the disc entirely, but the rest of the record is surprisingly catchy and listenable. Like most great things, it has to grow on you a bit. Bear in mind you won't see any of these tracks in a modern Stones setlist, as the majority of the audience would be scratching their heads and trying to remember just when in the 1960's they know this from. 'She's a Rainbow' is perhaps the most conventional song, except for its unintelligible intro. 'In Another Land' is so bad that it's sort of funny and likable, although most Amazon reviewers seem to disagree with that. Overall it's a record that fans will probably tolerate or hate, with only a certain few loving it. But it's worth a listen now and again.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|There are movies that friends tell you about, and if those friends are forceful enough or more people make the same recommendation, you rouse yourself and buy a ticket, and if the movie turns out to be terrific, the next thing you know you're telling everyone about a film they just have to see.<br /><br />This is called \\"buzz,\\" and it's a very good thing indeed --- media companies hire consultants, often for impressive sums, to create that initial spark.<br /><br />But \\"Once\\" starred Glen Hansard, lead singer of a terrific Irish band --- The Frames --- that's sadly unappreciated outside of Ireland. His co-star was Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, a 17-year-old Czech high school student who had never acted before.<br /><br />And it was filmed, in 17 days, for $150,000.<br /><br />For the longest time, the future of \\"Once\\" looked bleak: straight to DVD.<br /><br />Then the film was invited to Sundance. It won the Audience Award. Fox Searchlight bought it. And as \\"Once\\" went out into the world, audiences took to it like a beautiful orphan --- they cherished it and made it a cause.<br /><br />That's how I came to see it; many people prodded me. What they knew: I'm a sucker for emotion that feels authentic, and so I was absolutely enchanted by this little film.<br /><br />And I do mean little. He's a singer. His girlfriend has left him. He'd like to make a record and get out of Dublin. Right now, he repairs vacuum cleaners and sings on the streets. Her situation's just as dim. She may dream of music, but she's in an alien culture, separated from her husband; she sells flowers and cleans houses to support her kid and mother. He and She (they are nameless) get together to make music; they become collaborators and friends, their songs propelling the plot. But the big question --- for the audience, anyway --- isn't how their demo tape will be received. It's whether they'll become lovers.<br /><br />\\"Two people, a few instruments, 88 minutes and not a single false note,\\" A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times.<br /><br />And what people! At the start of the movie, Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; seemed like her character: a young woman of modest charms and uncertain talent. By the end, I was convinced she was the most beautiful woman in the world, a great talent and a deep soul. Love? I was besotted. And Glen Hansard was the ultimate admirable guy: smart, resourceful, realistic, emotionally aware.<br /><br />And what music! Hansard started strumming his guitar, and I got weepy. Then he started singing, slow as a nursery lullaby:<br /><br />I...don't...know....you<br />But...I....want...you<br />All...the...more...for...that<br />Words...fall...through...me<br />And...always...fool...me<br /><br />There are, I think, only two responses to feelings this directly expressed: cynicism and acceptance. Friends, this cynic was overcome: I blubbered. And I wasn't the only one.<br /><br />You may have heard some of the soundtrack; it pops up on better radio stations. If it's considerably more \\"professional\\" than the film, there are reasons. Some of the songs were among the greater hits of the Frames. Hansard and Irglov&aacute; had recorded a CD together. And the film's director, John Carney, was savvy about music --- he had once played bass in The Frames.<br /><br />Though this is music like no other --- not folk, not rock, mostly just two people literally singing their hearts out --- it's not just for emotional slobs like me.

B000784WMW|5.0|I love this movie.  Unlike the newer, American version, it doesn't hack the book to pieces.  All my favorite parts of the book are there and it is so wonderful and romantic.  Timothy Dalton is too handsome to make a perfect version of Mr. Rochester, but as if being handsome were a crime....  It makes it a very beautiful love story.
B000PMGS8G|4.0|Flash Gordon (Savior of the Universe Edition) is FUN to watch.  We consider it a Sci-Fi Classic.  There is 1 episode of the old black and white series of Flash Gordon on the DVD, which was cute to see, but would have been much better if they had the whole series to compare with the movie.  Love the campy movie, very colorful version.  Of course, music by Queen is fantastic !  Can watch it over and over.  It's GREAT !
B0006GAXKK|5.0|This is one of the Bee Gees best albums of all time. I had the original release and am really wanting to pick this one up on CD. Has this Japanese re-release been re-mastered or enhanced in anyway? This is one album that certainly deserves that treatment!
B000002LGQ|5.0|Madonna's \\"Like A Prayer\\" album was one of the very best records of the 80's and certainly the very best record Madonna has ever released up to that point. It's a lot like \\"Ray of Light,\\" Madonna's follow-up, 10 years later.     On \\"Like A Prayer\\" Madonna's passion is not the Cabala, it is Catholicism. On this record, Madonna candidly sings about her life, her marriage, her failures, her relationships, her father and the devastating loss of her mother.     The title-track is perhaps Madonna's most artistic song of her entire career. The lyrics are powerful and very thought-provoking. She's down on her knees and she wants to \\"take you there\\" with Like A Prayer\\" in the \\"midnight hour.\\" This is such a unique song because it has both an old and a new sound.     Madonna gives an anthem to all women (and maybe even some men, too) telling them that it's better to be alone than to be with anyone who is less than your ideal in \\"Express Yourself.\\" Prince has a rare duet with Madonna in \\"Love Song.\\" Madonna opens up about her troubles with Sean with \\"Till Death Do Us Part.\\" Madonna speaks to the little girl within in \\"Promise To Try.\\" She sings of the love of her life in \\"Cherish.\\" And then she sings of pink elephants and lemon-aide with \\"Dear Jessie.\\" Madonna gets very personal in \\"Oh Father.\\" And she sings a song about Jesus with \\"Spanish Eyes.\\" \\"Keep It Together\\" reminds everyone that \\"family is gold.\\" Madonna ends the record with \\"Act of Contrition,\\" and as usual adds a touch of comedy during the final track.     Madonna didn't do a single live interview or any type of promotion for this record when it was released on March 1989. But it still managed to go straight to number one (both the record and the single, \\"Like A Prayer.\\") That was the power of Madonna in the 80's.
B0001HAISG|5.0|When I was growing up I enjoyed the classic story of Peter Pan - but the movies were always lacking in some way.  The Disney \\"standard\\" is animated, which is an inherent barrier between you and the movie.  The various live-action adaptations, on stage and on screen, traditionally err by casting a young woman in the title role.  It's an understandable way to get someone with more acting experience as the star, but it just doesn't really do the job.  Also, there is a tendency with children's movies to make them short and simple; the Disney version clocks in at a mere 77 minutes, which just doesn't do the story justice.<br /><br />This version gets it exactly right, by discarding all of those traditions.<br /><br />The visual effects are advanced enough that Neverland can really come to life, but they don't make the mistake of making the movie ultra-realistic - witness the stylized spacescape that Peter and the children enter once they pass the clouds on their way from London.  Similarly, the movie does well by casting people who aren't Big Names, with the one exception of Lynn Redgrave in a minor role.  This means that you aren't watching Actors In Roles; you can lose yourself in the portrayals and let Jeremy Sumpter *be* Peter Pan for the duration of the movie.  It's not a musical, so you're not distracted by having the main characters burst into song every so often.  You can finally lose yourself in the movie, as every actor fits their role perfectly and the effects only serve to support the vision of what Neverland should have always been.<br /><br />In short, this is a magnificent adaptation of the classic story.  In my DVD collection, I have this as my only version of \\"Peter Pan\\" and [[ASIN:0767836324 Hook]] as the sequel to it, and that is how I recommend the \\"Peter Pan Experience\\" to everyone.  Just as \\"Hook\\" did a remarkable job of imagining Peter Pan as a grownup, this movie gives the original story that same degree of reality that the other versions have so sorely lacked.
0743201140|4.0|My brother bought this book and highly recommended it.  The book itself is great.  Easy to read and very informative.  I also recommend the book as it will help you to identify where your true talents lie and how you can develop those talents in your career or to even pursue a career that reinforces your talents.    The premise behind this book is that everyone develops certain abilities that they are good at while they are young.  People use these talents regularly everyday to make decisions and to react to events around them.  We do this without even thinking about it.  The book explains that you will be better off and much happier if you can develop these talents into strengths instead of putting large amounts of efforts into trying to work on our weaknesses.  Our weaknesses are things we are not good at and do not enjoy doing.  Any effort put into correcting our weaknesses is just undesired work.    The main thing I want to mention about this book is that it includes a URL to a website used to identify your own talents.  Each jacket cover contains a secret code used to login.  The code is only valid once.  So DON\\"T BUY THIS BOOK USED!  Get the book and enjoy it, but be the first buyer.

B00003CWTI|2.0|I've only watched this movie in pieces. Anyone who could sit through the whole thing in one sitting, well, my hat is off to you.    The director obviously got sucked up into believing all the artsy-fartsy accolades heaped upon him by snobby critics who, of course, are far more intelligent than the movie-going public!     Julianne Moore is the female version of Jude Law: In every other movie that does NOT make any profit. Now that she's aged,we all hope she'll disappear!She's exactly the same over-acting hack in every movie.     This movie seems like it was made from leftover characters the director had on the back burner all looking for a movie to be in. Trouble is, he tried to tie them all together with a cohesive plot, of which there is none.    What were the frogs? I got to thinking maybe there was a catagory 10 hurricane somewhere and they got sucked up and dropped. Great affects, fast forward to the frogs, they were far more interesting than anything else in this piece of tripe. I'd rather see the movie about the frogs sucked up by the hurricane.     Boogie Nights written and directed by Anderson was very entertaining, a bit of a downer, but a great lesson for idiots planning a career in porn.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|I've waited and waited for this collector's edition while scoffing at the bare-bones release for the better part of a decade.  Come on, this is legendary director Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of the most iconic vampire story of all time, surely they could do better.  Well, my prayers have finally been answered.  30+ minutes of deleted scenes, director's commentary, documentaries; this is what I'm talking about!  The cover is rather silly, as if someone caught Drac without his makeup on and he's shielding his face from the camera, but it's the movie that counts, right?<br /><br />The film itself is a visual masterpiece that suffers both from it's overwrought, big-budget nature and it's annoying lack of faithfulness to the original work.  I mean, if you're going to call it \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" the least one could reasonably expect is for the story to stick as closely to the book as possible.  Sure, there are plenty of lines from both the novel and the classic Bela Lugosi film as well as plenty of other faithful details, but that isn't necessarily enough.  The biggest chink in this film's shiny armor is the baffling romantic story that is shoehorned into what was a classic horror yarn.  I'm not talking about the romance between Mina Murray and Jonathan Harker, nor Lucy Westenra and her three suitors -those were in the book- but the romance between Mina and the undead monster that kidnapped her fiance, raped and murdered her best friend to bring her back as a soulless creature that feasts on children in the night.  Not a good foundation for any relationship.  And let's face it, the whole \\"vampire searching for his reincarnated lost love\\" storyline is a terrible cliche that never fails to make an otherwise good horror film drag.  This was a bad move on Coppola's part that compromises the film's integrity in an attempt to appeal to the Anne Rice set.  The time spent on Mina and Dracula's romance would have been much better spent on sequences that were left out of the film, such as Drac's wolves tearing apart a mother who comes looking for her child that was stolen in the night by the vampire, or the fate of the ship's captain who ties himself to the steering wheel with a crucifix attempting to avoid sharing his crew's fate and is found dead that way when the ship docks.  And then there's Jonathan Harker's attempt to end Dracula's life with a shovel while he sleeps in his coffin.  These are three of the most memorable scenes in the novel (the latter, at least, is available as a deleted scene) and they would have been amazing on film.<br /><br />The performances are uneven at times, but are overall quite good.  Keanu Reeves will always be Keanu Reeves, but his performance doesn't detract from the film as much as it could have since his blandness certainly helps the Mina-loves-Dracula story seem a little more believable.  Anthony Hopkins gives an enthusiastic performance as the original vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing; commanding at times, and at other times bizarre and off-putting.  There is a scene which was deadly serious in the book where Van Helsing is attempting to explain the gravity of the threat Dracula's influence poses and Hopkins delivers lines like  \\"We are dealing with forces beyond all human experience, and enormous power. So guard her well. Otherwise, your precious Lucy will become a bi+ch of the Devil! A whore of darkness!\\" to Lucy's lover while attempting to suppress hysterical laughter.  Real classy, Abe!  Speaking of Lucy, Sadie Frost plays her as an extremely sexy, charming, and eventually horrifying tragic character.  Spot on.  Not much needs to be said about Gary Oldman; he is an unbelievable actor who goes so far into his characters that he is often unrecognizable.  As the 19th century vampire lord who has lived for centuries, this one is no exception.  Wynonna Ryder plays Mina with an interesting mix of innocence and sexual curiosity and though she comes off as clueless in the end, I'll let it slidesince she wasn't the brightest bulb in the book either.  Dracula's three brides are portrayed in very memorable fashion: seductive, beautiful, and terrifying.  Perfect.<br /><br />The deleted scenes are a mixed batch, featuring some truly ghastly acting from Reeves in an otherwise grand alternate opening, much more of the film's awesomely elaborate sets, and at least one scene that should have stayed in (discussed previously).  Throw in four solid documentaries and commentary from the director and you've got a DVD done right.<br /><br />Other than the few major quibbles I've discussed, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is the most faithful and visually impressive Dracula adaptation to date.  There are scenes that will thrill, repulse, titillate, and creep you the hell out, sometimes all at once.  It also features some of the coolest edits ever in a horror film and plenty of shocking imagery.  While it fails to capture the charm, iconic performances, and legendary status of the original \\"Dracula\\" (still my favorite vampire film) this is a worthy update and, with the bonus features, this is an no-brainer for horror and vampire fanatics.  If you haven't seen this film you've missed out on a unique, visually staggering, and atmospheric take on the greatest vampire story ever told and you shouldn't hesitate to pick this up.sn't the brightest bulb in the book either.

Jon Schaffer pulls off yet another superbly crafted concept album with this archaic yet sci-fi tale of mankind's last stand to defend all they know against extra-terrestrial invasion under the increasing threat of Armageddon.  The album's 19 tracks tell an intricate tale of this epic struggle of biblical proportions.    Cleverly sprinkled throughout the album are shorter tracks (around 50 seconds to 2 minutes in length) that add more depth and \\"texture\\" to the piece as a whole, something many self-proclaimed concept albums from other groups hasn't really attempted.  It is beautifully and thoroughly done by Schaffer and Iced Earth in this album.  Seriously, how many bands do you know of who would put in a track which is nothing but thunder, lightning, mechanical surges, and soft choral whispers? GENIUS!    If you loved the Something Wicked This Way Comes album, or any of IE's concept albums, or just love IE in general, this album is definitely for you!  Come experience the battle to preserve mankind with us, and pick up this album now!  I also recommend getting the new Overture of the Wicked album too (the re-recordings of the classic Something Wicked Trilogy), for a new twist on the classic trilogy which coincides with the themes set in Framing Armageddon.      In closing, I'd like to thank Jon Schaffer and Iced Earth for continuing to make beautiful, and meaningful music.  I hope the journey never ends.  Looking forward to Something Wicked Part 2!!  Stay metal!  \m/

B000005IU2|5.0|People still argue over whether or not the Stooges Fun House was an influential album for the punk genre.  Some people think it's just a regular hard rock album with lots of high energy, while others really believe it paved the way for punk in just a few years.  I honestly fall into the second category- there was nothing like this in 1970.  This is some of the craziest rock/punk music I've ever heard.      Throwing in saxophone jams at the end of the album was a nice added touch.  Of course people shouldn't be surprised to hear saxophone jams on a punk-sounding album because the early 70's rock scene always offered unpredictable moments of brilliance with instrumental variety.  It's basically one exciting intense, energetic track after another.  This album doesn't really let up at all.  I guess \\"Dirt\\" (a powerful mellow drug trip type atmospheric song) and \\"1970\\" (with a really energetic and catchy guitar riff) would be my favorite songs, though it's really hard to say.  I also love \\"T.V. Eye\\" a lot, because it sounds WAY ahead of its time in terms of sheer brutal heaviness.      True story- while in 10th grade, my dad took a walk through a forest and found an old abandoned car just sitting in the woods.  He opened the door and guess what was laying on the floor?  Yup, the Stooges Fun House.  It was in terrible condition with scratches all over it, and definitely the CD in my collection in the very worst condition, but guess what?  It plays perfectly fine in my Playstation and my DVD player.  Awesome!  For my dad to find such a wonderful album by pure luck makes me believe everything happens for a reason.
0765348780|4.0|I purchased this book as Eriksons work was likened to GRRM.  Although Gardens of the Moon is not as great as game of thrones was, it still is one of the top fantasy novels to have recently come out.  The characters are deep, the storyline intertwined, and the descriptions are unbelievable.  While Erikson is not super similar to GRRM, he still creates a great world and is highly recommended for those searching for their next fantasy series to start.
B000068FY0|5.0|Never knew this album when it originally was released.It mesmerized me......wonderful piano and sax.absolutely loved it.
075640407X|5.0|While waiting for Dance of Dragons to come out, I stumbled upon the great reviews for Name of the Wind.  Seeing the review that it was likened to be better than HP, I decided to check it out.  Indeed, it shares similar qualities to HP, as it is not necessarily to the hardcore fantasy crowd, but still is a great read for both newcomers to the series and those who love fantasy.  Its greatest attributes is that it does not follow the so typical elf, evil, dragon storylines of so many fantasy novels, but rather tells the tell of an extraordinary man.  Seriously, check it out! youll like it
B000063UR2|5.0|i don't care how old this movie is it rocks!! If u havent seen it you need to!!
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Having never seen any Asian based films, I was skeptic of actually making this purchase.  However, after hearing many great things,  I decided to check this out, and was I glad.  Likened to the asian version of Lord of the Flies, this film contrasts both teenage violence with a great storyline.  A great film!
0385339704|1.0|I normally like Grisham's work, and I think his first two novels were first-rate.  THE PELICAN BRIEF, however, suffers from a remarkably silly plot.<br /><br />You're supposed to believe that a 25-year old law student is able to figure out something that the CIA, FBI, Supreme Court, and national media cannot.  I'm a lawyer, and I found the legal aspect of this book to be absolutely ridiculous.  I realize THE PELICAN BRIEF is meant to be escapist entertainment, but I think a plot has to be half-way credible in order for me to enjoy it.<br /><br />It didn't help that the characterization was paper-thin and on the level of caricature.  The heroine of this book is beautiful and smart, but has very little real personality.  She spends most of her time running from place to place, dodging inept assassins.  Her two love interests in this novel are lecherous and not the least bit likable.<br /><br />If you've never read Grisham before, my advice is to skip this book and read THE FIRM or A TIME TO KILL instead.  Those novels are far superior to THE PELICAN BRIEF.
1878424165|5.0|Deepak Chopra's The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is a super way to compliment your self-help library. Even though I am not one to usually jump on the spiritual bandwagon, reading this book and listening to the tape helped me understand the laws of the universe better, and how important they are to adhere to. From what Mr. Chopra is teaching, it seems that the universe is guided by benevolent forces, and if we follow them, then we're likely to succeed and be happy and fulfilled. I highly recommend this book and/or tape.
0446343129|5.0|Although this book was originally written over 25+ years ago, it is still valid reading for those looking to kick sugar.    An interesting note is that author Dufty was inspired to delve into the subject after meeting aging yet ageless movie star Gloria Swanson (70s???).  He ended up marrying her and was her last husband!
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanye west is known for speaking his mind (Hurricane Katrina), bragging (see \\"Barry Bonds\\" on the new CD), and throwing temper tantrums (Grammy and MTV awards), that it's quite easy to forget what a brilliant artist/producer he is.<br /><br />\\"Graduation\\" is the third, and final of his thematically titled CDs, which began with \\"The College dropout\\", and continued with \\"Late registration\\", both of which raised the bar for hip hop releases.<br /><br />This raises the bar even higher, examples being the Daft Punk sampling UK #1 smash \\"Stronger\\" with it's vocodered vocals, blazing pop synths, and stomping beats, and the reggae tinged pair of (the self assertive) \\"Champion\\", and closing cut \\"Good night\\".<br /><br />At 14 tracks, there's no filler, and Kanye does away with interludes which usually comprise half of most R&B and Hip hop albums these days.<br /><br />Other standouts include the brooding \\"Big brother\\" (with lyrics dealing with his relationship with Jay Z), the slowed down \\"I wonder\\" (which starts off deceptively like a piano ballad, before kicking into an upbeat number with deliberately phrased lyrics), the gospel tinged \\"Homecoming\\" (with a Sting-sounding Chris Martin singing the chorus and playing piano), \\"The glory\\" (which features his trademark chipmunk/helium vocals), the Michael Jackson \\"PYT\\" sampling \\"Good life\\" (featuring T-Pain), the sombre \\"Can't tell me nothing\\", and the awesome string laden techno tinged \\"Flashing lights\\" (featuring Dwele).<br /><br />Look out for the bonus track, \\"Bittersweet\\" which features John Mayer and is very good. To be honest, there isn't a single dull moment on this CD.<br /><br />This might lose a few fans who are into more hard core rap, but Kanye is aiming for a wider spectrum of fans here.<br /><br />Definitely the best Hip hop release of the year, oh, along with the (largely) Kanye produced \\"Finding forever\\" by Common. Oh, and announcing the retirement of 50 Cent...
B000RZIGUY|5.0|This action packed movie stars two great actors Nicolas Cage and John Travolta at their best. A great movie if you're a fan of action films, or just like either of the actors. Castor Troy (Cage) has planted a bomb somewhere and agent Sean Archer (Travolta) must literally switch identities with his old enemy in order to find out where the bomb is and disable it. I don't usually hand out 5 stars but this one definatly deserves it!
B000NRPJEW|5.0|The previous reviewer has done a good job describing the different plots so there's no need for repetition here.  This is a great movie and by far the best role I've seen Mortensen play. The settings and costumes are beautiful and the story, though sometimes difficult to follow, always keeps the viewer interested. But it's Mortensen's character that is particularly well portrayed. He's not the perfect hero at all. Capable of cruelty and deception somehow we still warm to him and admire him. And that's Mortensen's achievement. All the sub-plots come together well too. For those of us who think that it's more and more rare to see a 'new' movie because most of what's produced today is basically a re-hash of the usual stories and themes, then here's one worth watching and something different from the usual Hollywood mass production.
B000PY52EU|4.0|Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci are two of my favorite screen actors. They're both quirky iconoclasts who occasionally make studio films, but always seem to really shine in offbeat, smaller pictures. The relationship between their two characters, Lazarus and Rae, is the heart and focus of this film. Both characters have been wounded by sex in ways that strangely complement one another: Lazarus has been betrayed by his cold, promiscuous wife, and Rae's history of sexual abuse has brought about her character's uncontrollable sexual compulsion.<br /><br />Lazarus and Rae meet when Rae is beaten and left unconscious by the side of the road after humiliating one of the many suitors who take advantage of her compulsive promiscuity. Lazarus nurses her back to health, and then feels a self-righteous desire to \\"cure\\" her of her \\"illness\\", however, it is clear that he is trying to save himself somehow as much as he is trying to save her.<br /><br />As much as Ricci and Jackson carry the film, a lot of credit is also owed to the soundtrack. The blues music wonderfully complements the emotions and circumstances of the two tormented characters. The songs speaks of sex, betrayal, sadness and redemption; the perfect musical complement to the themes of the film.
1594489505|4.0|I really loved THE KITE RUNNER, which is one of my favorite novels of the past few years.  A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS isn't nearly as great as that book, but it's still a very good read.<br /><br />This novel deals with the plight of women if Afghanistan, which is very difficult indeed.  As Hosseini demonstrates, women in that nation have often been treated as second-class citizens, especially by the Islamic extremists who occupied the country after the Soviets pulled out.<br /><br />There are two major female characters in A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS, and both of them suffer quite a bit in this novel.  This makes for a compelling read, but I think Hosseini indulges in melodrama in quite a number of scenes.  There is, for example, a husband character who seems almost ridiculously evil: he has almost no redeemable qualities whatsoever, and he serves little purpose in this novel other than to act abusive and vicious in scene after scene.  Personally, I was hoping for the characterization in this novel to be a bit more complex, like it was in THE KITE RUNNER.<br /><br />That being said, there's no denying that Hosseini knows how to construct a compelling plot.  I found the storyline in A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS to be very absorbing, and I was emotionally moved by a great deal of it.  This novel also provides the reader with a great history of Afghanistan over the past twenty years or so.  It made me interested in learning more about the country, just like THE KITE RUNNER did.<br /><br />In short, this book isn't as good as THE KITE RUNNER, but it's much better than your average novel.  I recommend it overall, but I would strongly suggest reading THE KITE RUNNER first, if you haven't done so already.  That novel is a true masterpiece.
B00006JU7T|4.0|Sidney Lumet, whose other big hit with Pacino was Dog Day Afternoon [[ASIN:B000CNESTE Dog Day Afternoon (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] , had a good eye for keeping it real in a time when most movies were usually overly melodramatic. I'd even go as far to say that Lumet might have been one of the pioneers of movies that inspired the best directors of today to ask questions like \\"is that what would really happen\\" and \\"is that how a person would really respond\\" before allowing a scene to get printed.<br /><br />Serpico still had its 70s era movie making quirks, but overall it was ahead of its time for making you feel \\"truly involved\\" with its characters. And having a young, talented Al Pacino in the cast (as the lead) certainly helped make an award-winning film. (The year prior {1972} Pacino made his breakthrough in The Godfather [[ASIN:B00003CXAA The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)]] .)<br /><br />Serpico is based on the real-life exploits of a NYC cop that is credited with exposing broad, long-standing corruption in the NYC police department (Serpico was a cop from 1959 - 1971). Clearly this exposure was not wanted by his colleagues. And the 1973 movie is a dramatic documentation of what Serpico went through trying to be an honest cop.<br /><br />The movie gets a bit long in the badge by the final 30 minutes, but the suspense of seeing if/how Frank Serpico collars his peers keeps you interested.<br /><br />The audio wizards have given Serpico a nice Dolby 5.1 make-over, and the picture quality has been enhanced as well. Interesting piece of history for one of those evenings that your queue is light on the new.
B0000844I8|5.0|I Love This Movie.My Favoerite Actor Is Kurt Russell.<br />I Highly Recomend The Movie.<br />Denise
B000VECAEO|5.0|I would never give Seinfeld anything less than five stars, but I have to agree with the other reviewer.  The price has been seemingly unnecessarily inflated.  Deflate it to the price of the other seasons, I wouldn't hesitate to make the purchase.  But even as a Seinfeld afficionado, I would never be dumb enough to purchase it at that ridiculously inflated price.  A horrible move indeed.

B000RG1FMO|5.0|I am so glad i paid for this CD. Kanye came with the creativity, that is something 50 cent never comes with. To me he is one of the out of the box and creative rapper out.    1. Good Morning - Beat is tough, i love this is the introduction to the rest of the CD. 4/5    2. Champion - One of my favorite songs on the albums beat is perfect of course, flows is nice, but can't get over the beat. 5/5    3. Stronger - Beautiful creative beat that features Daft Punk, kanye spit nice on here to 3 favorite on the CD. 5/5    4. I Wonder - Kanye is one of my favorite producers/rapper now, he just came hard with this album, you can tell he actually tried, beautiful song. 5/5    5. Good Life - I Love this song, i would play this song in my car or something song makes you feel good, great beat, great flow. 5/5    6. Can't Tell Me Nothing - Anthem for everyone I think. First music video i have seen with one woman, one car, in a dessert i think, just spilling out what he thinks about everything. 5/5    7. Barry Bonds - I like this song a little bit, not one of my favorite maybe because of Lil Wayne, i don't know. 3.5/5    8. Drunk N Hot Girls - Alright song. 3/5    9. Flashing Lights - Another hot song, really beautiful, nice flow. 4/5    10. Everything I Am - No body does beats/songs like this. Also scratches by the great DJ Premier 5/5    11. The Glory - Nice beat, slick flow, this is what creativity is, I hope  so called \\"rappers\\" would do this more often. 5/5    12. Homecoming - Love It! Chris Martin voice is great on a song, might be simple but hes hot. Beat is serious, flow is nice too. 5/5    13. Big Brother - Number one favorite song on the album. Kanye was right I think this is a stadium song that make you actually listen. Love the beat, kanye flow on here is very nice. 10/5    The Album is the most creative album that been out, since lupe's album. First album that doesn't talk about the same thing everyone else is talking about. I love it. If you want to make a decision whether to get 50 Cent's Album or Kanye's. My advice would be Kanye's, I heard 50's album the same thing like every album he does nice beats but sucky flow,  no creativity, he should stick to being a business man.

0751532711|5.0|The power of this book is in its ability to inspire. Many people have great ideas of how they can improve their financial situation but never take action. Kiyosaki's personal experiences described in the book encourage those calculated risks that may prove lucrative. He also incorporates basic financial principles that should be applied habitually.<br /><br />You will undoubtedly pick up several nuggets of wisdom in this read. I've given it as a gift to some of my clients' children when they turned 18.
1400063515|1.0|This book is a rambling discourse on the obvious by a self-aggrandizing author. The book gestures at the profound but only skims along the surface, and provides no insightful perspective on universal forces.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Casino gets back to the original roots of a Bond with a nearly psychotic rage who kills without compunction.  It also explains more of how he becomes the detached spy and shuns real personal ties.  The stunts are traditional stuntmen based ones, not computer graphic generated ones so it adds to the realism. There are enough cartoonish movies so it's good to see a real old fashioned thriller.
076780421X|5.0|I have been watching this \\"feel good\\" movie for a while now, and I absolutely love it, as it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I purchased the dvd so that I can watch it as often as I like.  Both actors gave a fantastic performance, and had great chemistry.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Everyone should see this series.  Planet earth is absolutely outstanding.  There are places on this earth that you never thought existed and this series takes you to all of them.  The blu-ray picture quality is beyond compare and every scene is as if you are seeing it with your own eyes.
B000002U6E|4.0|Another album of unique sounds. This one contains a world renown classic \\"Return to Innocense\\". In addition to Return to Innocense, my personal favorite song contains the lyrics I love you I'll kill you...ouuuuu so dangerous.
1400064627|5.0|I love the movie version. Watch it about once a year. The book fleshes out the beloved characters very well. The book is a keepsake to be re-read often.
B000RF1QDI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites movies. Now in HD-DVD it cames with some nice features and with an incredible quality
B0007MWZEK|4.0|The swivel sweeper is great!!  My Mom is 83 years old with alot of back problems, and she is able to clean her own hard floors.  It is light and easly moves in and out from under her chairs and dinning area.  She loves it, and it has given her more independence.  I have a cat that lives indoors, and I can't believe the amount of little hair it gets up on my tile floors.  I have never used it on carpet, just hard floor so I don't know if it works as well on carpet.  I give it a BIG thumbs up!!
B000OLGCHA|4.0|As heard in the movie : *****  As heard on CD: ***  Overall: ****    I wouldn't declare this score as one of my favourites but it is definitely one of the better ones of the rather meager offerings from 2007.  I read that quite a few people are unhappy with the score and declare it one of the worst from the HP series. I wouldn't say that at all. For one thing, every composer has a different style and while the one from John Williams is the most crowd pleasing one, Hooper's is also very effective and grew on me, after  listening to it more then once. It is highly effective in the movie and adds a lot to the dark atmosphere of the movie. The adagio like quality of the track \\"Possession\\" and the dark rumblings of the Teiko drum gives me goosebumps every time I listen to it. Hooper also creates some very distinct themes as for example the one from Dolores Umbridge which is like her persona overly sweet that borders annoying and pure madness. I love the fact that so many different composers and directors give their talents to the HP series and though this entry of Nicholas Hooper is a bit prickly and needs some getting used to, it is a worthy entry for the series. Something I did not like about the CD though is the way it was compiled. Similar actually to  John Williams this album was compiled in such a way that it is supposed to assure the best listening experience, which I think is a lot of bollocks. I rather have my tracks in the order they appeared in.
0743298020|4.0|This novel offered me just what I was looking for: beautifully written, engaging, great story, and rich. Though I feel the ending was a bit flat, I would highly recommend this book. It makes for a great read!!
B000UR9TQE|5.0|Rest assured that this DVD will have DTS sound - the same as the previous Led Zeppelin concert DVD set.  Jimmy Page has been working on this project for years.  Do you HONESTLY think he is going to throw something substandard together at this stage of the game?  It will be fantastic!!!!!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|We purchased this CD after watching this wonderful group on PBS.  My husband and I like rock and roll, but do enjoy other kinds of music.  So it's kind of funny that we like this so much.  The harmony of these ladies is just great.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Absolutely top of the line for entertainment and education of the masses about the blues....
B000PFUA9G|4.0|This is not Brad Paisley's best album ever. It is, in fact, a slight disappointment after \\"Time Well Wasted.\\" But it's not a bad album at all. There's a decent mix of funny and serious, and I imagine several hits will come from this album. If you're a Brad fan, I'd definitely buy this. If you're only just getting to like him, buy another of his albums first. Add this to your collection when you are already a big fan.
B000066C1N|5.0|I gave this CD to my friends son who was turning 4 yrs. old.  He loved the movie and now he loves the CD and can listen to the songs in the car.

0767827902|4.0|I had never seen the movie, but read the book. That's when I   decided I had to watch the movie. Although I prefer the book, the movie was very good.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|Iced Earths last effort, TGB was good in spots, very good in spots. However the biggest problem was the absence of Matt Barlow's voice and the vibe that went with it. The arrival of Ripper Owens, although a fine singer in his own right, just seemed to missing something? Perhaps he was trying to hard at times to fill Matt's shoes, who knows? Anyway the concept/history lesson was great and the music was awesome even though I could have done without the U.S. Anthem twice. In many ways, it was a very good release from a band redefining itself to a certain extent.<br /><br />Well I'm here to say that's not the case this time out. Ripper has settled in nicely and does a great job here. Matt will always be missed as he just had a certain something about his delivery, but John has picked a worthy successor. Ripper's phrasing and just overall oomph is awesome! The music is again top notch as John pretty well lays it all down himself by playing just about everything on here. Yes he has guest come on and lay down some leads and other goodies, but for the most part it's all him and he is in my honest opinion one of the best metal rhythm players alive. I did find however that it's missing some really catchy riffs at times. Sometimes it just seems to be going along without any zest. I think it could use a little more zip from time to time to keep the listener interested.<br /><br />The tunes do flow together seamlessly and they all work together for a very cohesive effort that is indeed a good effort and well worth the wait!<br /><br />If I could say one thing to John it would be, more catchy riff's man, it needs a few more catchy riff's!!
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Blondie - the coolest band from the new wave era. Blondie's music is timeless and seriously addicting. Lead singer, Debbie Harry was the epitome of sex appeal with her model good-looks and brash personality. She was not only beautiful but an outrageously talented vocalist and songwriter. But the whole band had undeniable talent as well. This greatest hits album is jam-packed with flawless melodies, catchy hooks, and glittery arrangements. Blondie's music was NEVER fluffy or artificial. Their songwriting was razor sharp, and their sound was both groundbreaking and accessible. Blondie took risks and the results were extraordinary. They were never afraid to tweak their signature sound and break into different genres like: pop, \\"Dreaming\\", power pop, \\"Union City Blue\\", euro pop, \\"Call Me\\", doo-wop, \\"In The Flesh\\", disco, \\"Heart Of Glass\\", reggae, \\"The Tide Is High\\", rap, \\"Rapture\\", and calypso, \\"Island of Lost Souls\\". There's a special mix of \\"Sunday Girl\\" which features Debbie singing the second verse in French. And Blondie's comeback song, \\"Maria\\" is also featured. And some of my favorite Blondie tracks also appear on this album like, \\"Rip Her To Shreds\\", \\"Atomic\\", \\"X Offender\\", \\"Picture This\\", \\"The Hardest Part\\", and \\"One Way Or Another\\". The sound quality on \\"Blondie: Greatest Hits\\" sounds crystal clear and free of imperfections. So what are you waiting for? Buy this today. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy!
B000053VAF|5.0|the plot of dogma is fairly simple. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are angels who were cast out of heaven and forced to live on earth. they discovered a loop hole in catholic doctorine which wold allow them to get back into heaven. thus proving that god is not infallible and undoing all existance. its up to Betty Aberlin, the last descendant of christ to stop them.<br /><br />over the course of her adventure, our heroine comes across all kinds of characters. the 13th apostle played by Chris Rock, 2 prophets (Jay and Silent Bob) this demon played by Jason Lee, the voice of god played by Alan Rickman, and some others. Dogma has some of the best scenes involving Jay and Silent Bob of any of Smith's films. \\"GEAR?!\\"<br /><br />Kevin Smith got a lot of heat for this movie. during production, he got multiple threats of violence, 2 of them death. religious fanatics... eh.<br /><br />BONUS FEATURES:<br /><br />Complete Set of Storyboards from Three Major Scenes<br />100 Minutes of Deleted Scenes with View Askew Crew Intros<br />Cast and Crew Outtakes<br />Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash Spot<br />Talent Files<br /><br />like ive said before, i really couldnt pick one of his movies above the rest, but if you havent seen any of the \\"Jersey Chronicles\\" Dogma isnt a bad start.

Or I can really genie it and hope that the SciFi channel will come to its senses and re-up this show.  Ah yes, back to Firefly.    Anyone who even liked the show has to get this version of the movie!  It is a must have for any DVD collection.  And don't forget to watch it with the commentaries on.
B000RIWAYY|5.0|This is so great. Here is why you need to get it.   If you play guitar.   If you love music.

If you value good music and musicianship.    Just buy it today it is great!!
006117758X|4.0|Bukowski is what Nietzcshe referred to as a chandala... he was ugly, he was abused and mistreated, he was a little mean, he was a little perverse, and he suffered and struggled a lot.     But he did it well and documented it well-- even the chandala need their documentarians, historians and champions...     In any event, one thing people shouldn't  confuse is that they probably would not want to be charles bukoswki unless it was their lot in life. As with many authors, Bukowski gets to take his shabby life and become a sympathetic protagonist.     It is not a bad thing to examine the lower depths as long as one doesn't forget there are also human heights that are attainable for some people.--not for people like Bukowski -- but for other types.    Bukowski's choice of cuisine  says it all--  Bukowski is Ham on Rye, perhaps with a piece of stale swiss cheese and 3 day old potato salad on the side. Bukowski is every 10th  guy at the wall mart -- who just also happened to be a writer with some insight into his life.-- perhaps it made it bearable for him. I hope so.
0316067598|5.0|This an awesome story based on true heroes of our special forces. Marcus Luttrells story should be told and re-told for generations, a great story about the bravest of men who love the USA. These men should be held up as role models to our youth instead of the garbage that is presented by professional sports and entertainment! Hooyah!
B00008BXJG|5.0|Are you kidding me?? The boys follow up some of the best albums of the 70's with THE pinnacle of the Bon Scott era. Wow! Every track smokes. Every track oozes Bon's ragged snarl. Every track makes me want to pump my fist and drink whiskey. Every track makes me think the band actually did sell their souls to make this so good. If you don't own this you need to because it will improve your world. I wish Bon would have lasted a few more years....
B000R4SMCW|4.0|It has been quite a while since I've seen such a great thriller.  This is just a fabulous movie with Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling playing battling characters who engage in a battle of wits. Hopkins plays a husband who discovers his wife having an affair, shoots her, confesses the same night and then has things cleverly arranged where it's almost impossible to convict him. Gosling plays a young, hotshot prosecuting attorney on his way to bigger and better things with a change of scenery to corporate law but gets stuck with this open-and-shut case right before he switches firms. The trouble is, it's a lot more than he figured and he isn't used to losing. Hopkins knows this, of course, and plays on his vanity.<br /><br />Gosling evolves from a me-only lawyer to someone who really wants justice, even if it costs him. Both characters are cocky and smart and the twists and turns just add to the fun.<br /><br />I could have watched this story unfold for another two hours and would have been happy to do so, am I'm not one to sit still for long periods these days. That's how good this was.  Highly recommended.
0618526412|3.0|I read tons of \\"pulp\\" novels and I've started adding some classics to my wish list--largely to see if the books I abhored in high school would be more enjoyable if they were not assigned reading.  The Heart is a Lonely Hunter was no better now.      As a character study it is superb; the main characters are deep, believable, and unique.  I understood the characters, or at least why they didn't understand themselves.  Each chapter with Mr. Singer made me smile with anticipation while I waited for something magical to happen to make the characters happy.     That was the problem with the book.  Each chapter barely moves the story forward, and in the end nothing happens.  There is so much potential for characters to talk and understand and change, but it never happens and the potential hangs over the entire book like a cloud.  The book simply ends.  No character is better off than they were in the beginning, no character's life path is appreciably changed from those of their next door neighbors.  In short, with the exception of Mr. Singer, there was no reason to write about these characters in terms of their participation in events that are worth writing about.    The book was not a labor to get through, but I was largely unsatisfied with the resolution.  I don't need a happy ending, but atleast give me a sense that the previous 200 pages somewhat affected that ending.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was an original Star Trek fan...Too young to really appreciate it at the time, but in love with it anyway, even the silly fifth season. I drove my parents nuts watching it, often out of order, in syndication....wherever I could watch it.....and burned out. However, fans never gave up, Gene Rodenburry kept pushing, and low and behold, a theatrical package was made up. By the time it hit the movies, it was being eclipsed by Star Wars and other films. Still, it led to a series of successful films, then returned to T.V. in the Next Generation, was wildly popular and spawned several several new spin offs. That is a TV producer's Dream.  Firefly can easily eclipse that. First of all, most trekkies were not onboard as fans of the original, much like firefly. The fanbase grew as the legend of the show did, the successful novelizations added literary interest, the Fan based stories allowed fans to interact, and the syndication exposed many people who had never seen the original airing.   Firefly has done that in a much shorter time. It went to theaters much quicker and does have the potential to reprise with the original cast in a new series.  In addition it has the internet to drive it in a way that Star Trek never did, web sites, internet sales, etc. All it takes is for Joss to reevaluate, consider what a unique and truly worthwhile project Firefly was, get Universal onboard and shop some new scripts, with DVD sales figuresfor both Firefly and Serenity to Various networks, cable would be best....Sci Fi, HBO or Showtime would be best. The avoid getting preachy, and syndication....and voila....a decade of quality Television,,,at least for an hour a week.  One negative is that two of the more interestinfg characters, Shepherd Book and Wash were killed off in the the movie as well as another promising new one in Mr. Universe. Continue the series as if serenity was never written and it could be great.

0316067598|5.0|Nowhere in the pages of modern American newspapers do I read these kinds of stories of bravery and soul searching idealism, as are found in the new book Lone Survivor.  It's written by Marcus Luttrell, a Navy Seal who survived a terrible firefight in Afghanistan, and co-authored by Patrick Robinson.  The book reveals how Seals are trained to an incredible discipline of mind and body.  It's a brilliant story, and flows unerringly through the rocky terrain of Afghanistan, and the sandy beaches of Coronado in San Diego.  These men learn to trust their own determination, and not give in to fear and exhaustion.  They also manage to conquer a moral quandary, that the far left accuses the military of not even seeing.  How can you see it yourself, if you won't hear the truth from one who has lived it?        The story involves the four Seals' decision not to kill three goatherds who had stumbled on their position.  Would the U.S. and world media crucify the Americans if they shot unarmed men?  Certainly the men would tell the Taliban their location?  Up to 200 armed Taliban warriors were camped nearby, and would surely overwhelm the team.  The group agonized, and ultimately left it up to Marcus Luttrell to make this decision -- a momentous, enormously difficult decision.  He listened to his inner voice, and said let them go.  Sure enough, hours later, warriors rained down upon them.       It's a magnificent fight, and Marcus lived to tell the tale for a reason I believe.  In pivotal battle scenes, Marcus felt the hand of God kept his rifle near him, after several miraculous slides for life.  These men got shot, and just kept fighting, killing Taliban left and right.  I believe they almost got a high value target, but ultimately, that mission wasn't possible.  Who else would have been in the most remote of locations with 200 fighters on hand?  Why else push a bad position with no cover for snipers?  The New York firefighter's patch on a buddy's sleeve tells it all.  This mission was important.    Every adult in America should read this book.  The powerful forces it describes are currently shaping our world.  Iraq and Afghanistan are the center of our war on terror.  For military fighters, they don't swear much, he's cleaned it up except for some battle dialogue.  You have to accurately report last words.  They're funny!  He lets loose a little more in his lone journey to survive, after the firefight.  Desperate thirst and a fierce determination kept him moving.       Navy Seal training is brutal, but these men lived the way they trained.  If it was at all possible to still move and fight, they did!  Shot to pieces, they loaded their weapons again and kept picking off fighters.  I'm amazingly proud of these brave and fearless Americans.       Just as Horatio survives in Hamlet to tell that tale of treachery, betrayal and redemption, Marcus drags himself down the mountain to find sanctuary from a Pashtun tribe, and lives to tell these tales of remarkable heroism and self sacrifice.
B00004Z459|2.0|As an 18 year old way back when this CD came out, I was pretty much into the current music scene as it was, so of course with all my extra cash I had from my job I bought this CD among a slew of other records as well.      I look back at this CD now...and I really don't see anything special about it, and likewise I can't see how it has even reached the mainstream \\"metal\\" scene as far as I can tell.  It DEFINITELY isn't metal, in fact I have no idea why they were even at an Ozzfest that I went to years back, it just did not fit at all.      Now, many people would consider a convergance of hip hop and metal...a GOOD synergy here...to be strictly a mix of metal background and hip hop vocals (Hip hop based on the lyrics exclusively, and metal based on the background riffs/drums...you can't converge metal vocals and hip hop background...would be funny just to hear!).  Linkin Park?  Sure, you get your guitars, but they sound SYNTHETIC on this album.  In fact, everything sounds like it is electronically done, which is all fine and dandy for a certain \\"sound\\", but calling this metal or any other form of rock is just plain wrong.  Hip hop isn't about the beats, it's the flow of the lyrics...the flow is there, but the convergance is not...NOTHING HYBRID ABOUT IT!    The first and absolute best synergy that can ever be found in this kind of convergance is Rage Against the Machine, and in all honesty Linkin Park does not even come close.      So what is Linkin Park?  The byproduct of a larger main stream hip hop scene, which, sad to say, started with Eminem's first release (sad because there was a lot of missed hip hop potential before that release, stuff that really could have sold much better).      Hybrid Theory - 2/5
B000QQFKYE|2.0|I love David Lynch movies, and I'm a very patient movie watcher. I don't have to understand a film to enjoy it, and figured out long ago the best way to enjoy a David Lynch film-- savor the creepy atmosphere, dark humor, and great set pieces.  Unfortunately with Inland Empire, this time around, there's just no \\"there\\" there. When I saw Inland Empire in a theater, I was ready to leave after an hour and a half but toughed it out to completion because I knew I would never make it that far again. Intellectualize it all you want, make all the excuses you need, work up a rationale that makes you feel better about it, but this is just three hours of David playing with a digital camera. Nothing interesting happens, there are very few if any of those great Lynchian moments to savor as in his other films, and the actors seem to be pretty much as baffled as we are as to their motivations and actions. Kudos to Laura Dern for giving it a great effort. Here's hoping the next film is less self-indulgent and more fulfilling. I'm giving it two stars only because I can't bear to give anything less to one of the greatest filmmakers of our time.
B000E33VWW|4.0|I always find it fascinating when two movies about the same topic come out very closely together. This has happened too many times for it to be coincidence. We had Dead Man on Campus vs. The Curve. Dangerous Liaisons vs. Valmont. Elizabeth vs. Shakespeare in Love. The Thin Red Line vs. Saving Private Ryan. Antz vs. A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo vs. A Shark's Tale Etc, etc. And now we have Capote vs. Infamous. Not just two movies with similar topics, but two movies that chronicle the exact same period of time about the exact same period of people, namely Truman Capote and the Kansas-family killers.    Scorecard    Better at being Truman Capote---Philip Seymour Hoffman. Toby Jones had the advantage of looking more like Capote, and being more on point with Capote's mannerisms, but his performance comes off as mimicry. Hoffman doesn't mimic, he acts. Plus, he gets points for degree of difficulty. He doesn't look like Capote at all, but he pulls it off. He even manages to make Capote somewhat sexy.     Better acting from the rest of the cast---Capote. With the exception of Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee, the rest of the Infamous cast is outshined by Capote's cast. Infamous has a lot of big names, but their parts are so minimal that it's almost a waste.    Better Love story---Capote. The love story is a little too subtle, but the interaction between Capote's Truman and Smith works really well. Perry Smith is portrayed with more gentility, and it becomes believable Truman could have fell for him. Daniel Craig plays Perry Smith like a schizophrenic who at one point gags and threatens to rape Capote. That's not how you fall in love. The love angle is not believable at all in Infamous.    Better script---Capote. The writing is tighter and more focused while Infamous's writing is a little jerky. We spend a little too much time with Truman's friends. And the interview style of the movie seems like a crutch. Capote was able to tell its story through action while Infamous needs the characters breaking the flow of the movie to tell the audience what's going on.     Better movie---Capote. It is bleak but better directed, better acted, and better executed. Infamous has lighter and funnier moments, but it can at times come off as frivolous.   I just wish Capote hadn't made Truman seem so evil. They play him entirely too ruthless and manipulative. And as a result, we are forced to sympathize with murderers of 4 innocent people.     In situations like this, it becomes obvious that the quicker one to the punch gets rewarded. Capote was released first; it got the attention; and it got the Oscar. Infamous is now just a footnote to Capote's page. But I like and enjoy both films; and maybe they should act as companion pieces. Glue them together, and maybe you'll get one accurate picture of Truman Capote.

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Every so often comes a movie that just works on all levels.  The Shawshank redemption is one of these movies - deservedly ranking right up there with The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, Casablanca, The Purple Rose of Cairo, Citizen Kane, etc.<br /><br />The story, as everyone knows, is based on a Stephen King novella (the same collection of stories that brought \\"Stand By Me\\" to the world).  While Steven King is known mostly for his gore and horror stories, these are his two best works ever.<br /><br />Although Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) is the hero and main character in the story, Red (Morgan Freeman) really steals the show.  What an incredible performance!  The rest of the cast is excellent of course.<br /><br />One of the true measures of a movie is how it looks ten years after it's released.  The Shawshank Redemption has not dated one second - it's as fresh and enjoyable to watch as the day it came out of the edit suite!
1582701709|3.0|Worthy in that it opens one's mind to reach beyond the stuff of life and that our lives are so much better being positive and open.  AND we still need to do our own work with our thoughts, beliefs and feelings.  Valuable to read and to be inspired.  And then follow-up with the life tools of Byron Katie so that whether or not you get those riches, mansions and fame... YOU are happy.  The Secret isn't really such a secret but it certainly shows how people WANT to find the ways to live more joyfully and abundantly.  Another breadcrumb for the path of learning and growing -- but no quick fix.

B00006GO99|5.0|When I first started to really ''get'' jazz 3 years ago, I had a rather personal technique to decide if a record was really good or not to me: After listening once,if I was able to remember each song, it was a good sign.   When I bought Monks Dream I had the music in my head all night and ever since!!!   This has happened only 4 times since. For Kind of Blue ( no surprise), Giant Steps, the Blues and the Abstract truth and Monks dream.  There are some really good recording out there but this is really a 10 out of 10! A must in any form (CD, vinyl....)
B00000AOUD|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - The previous Aqualung resulted in a smashing and critical success among Tull's works, but possessing a great fame, it also marked certain controversies about if the album was or wasn't a concept album, Anderson denied it was a concept album, but despite this everyone seemed to misunderstand an instead took Aqualung as a concept album. In a flush of anger, Anderson and the rest of Jethro Tull released the concept album Thick As A Brick, to stop the anxieties about a concept album, and in its structure, its notorious that Anderson composed a huge, epic masterpiece, while the main point of the concept album remains as a big parody of a concept album, bringing an impressive theme about a boy named \\"Gerald Bostock\\", who is disqualified in the last minutes of a poetry contest because, despite his poem is a crude and very serious perspective of the world by an 8 years old boy, it was considerated too insulting, while a series of controversies are unleashed (this you'll find if you read all the paper's content), so this album was an Anderson's exagerate warning about \\"this is what happens when I get mad\\". Despite its extremely humorous content, the album contains only one 46 minutes long song, while it becomes much more recognizable when dividing it into two parts (like the LP version). Being an uncanny masterpiece, it may be regarded as their only true progressive rock album, the strong varieties of styles in the song \\"Thick As A Brick\\" are some times lilting, sometimes soaring for its meaningful, conceptual lyrics, although while listening to the ongoing lyrics, its more of a mixture of poems' fragments to make it sound better, affecting its cohersion. Its main chorus and most memorable/recognizable mood is the somewhat woods-like, theatrical, medieval atmosphere of the acoustic guitar penned chorus and opening part, with some of Anderson's most memorable and acclaimed flute's riffs in all of his career, while its notorious a change when the song starts getting more louder and more progressive at the end of the 4th paragraph. While reaching onto the first \\"Later\\" of the first part of the song, the atmosphere changes considerably in a sofisticated way, it enters into a much more serious, somber atmosphere, with a dramatic scent, the final paragraphs of the first part and most of the second part of the song represent much more of a loud, heavy progressive aspect, but, while being more uncanny and having a distinctive fiercefulness, it also hit certain unconsistent textures, but quite few. The last paragraph of the second part is the second and final chorus of the song, returning into the song's previous mood. Characteristic among every progressive rock album, this is one of the most uncanny masterpieces of the world, being also one of the longest rock songs in the whole world, its extremely humorous, parodying concept, mixed with a fierceful, focused and unique aura in the song, switching from a number of moods and atmospheres, and keeping very meaningful and memorable traces in its music' fragments, take completely away the idea of boredom, but make sure to be in a patient mood before listening to it. And within performance details, new drummer Barriemore Barlow explosive moment comes in at the end of the 8th paragraph, while John Evan performance is breath taking. (this is the album's review, the next part is where I describe tha album's content).<br /><br />Now, I'm going to speak about the album's major content: the booklet itself is a whole newspaper in its structure, just as if it were the morning paper of a real event, make sure to read the important contents and highlights in the newspaper, it explains the whole story about \\"Little Milton\\"'s \\"insulting\\" poem and its big impact when it was read out loud in B.B.C., making parents around the whole city complaining about the dark matter of the poem, and how they felt insulted by an 8 year old boy writing that kind of stuff, while they were specially bothered because of his usage of the word \\"g_ _ r\\" (which it isn't revealed the word but fans suspect that is the word \\"goer\\"), making Bostock's poem to be disqualified, and instead, they gave the first prize to a girl who wrote a poem about the beauties and majesties of the world (its so funny when you actually read it!). Later on it explains how this album was made, when local \\"minor\\" band Jethro Tull were fascinated by Bostock's poem and decided to make an album out of it, making Bostock its co-writter. Later on it tells how Bostock sign a contract with Chrysalis Records, and in other news' fragments its present a rumor about a 14 year old girl who is pregnant and claim Bostock is the father. And, the most humorous part is where, below the lyrics, its written a \\"music review\\" badly critisizing the album, speaking just like a professional reviewer!, this part made me laugh so hard when I decided to write a review about the album. Of course, all of this is Anderson's invention, but all of the album's content make a perfect, collectable album, mixed with the strong imagery of the song, this album is just perfect.his usage of the word \\"g_ _ r\\" (which it isn't revealed the word but fans suspect that is the word \\"goer\\"), making Bostock's poem to be disqualified, and instead, they gave the first prize to a girl who wrote a poem about the beauties and majesties of the world (its so funny when you actually read it!).

B00005NTJM|3.0|Luis Mejia (son) - jethro tull's very first album, released in 1968, is certainly always an interesting piece for comparing their later expectations; at this time the band was formed by Ian Anderson (flute, lead vocals, piano) Mick Abrahams (guitar) Clive Bunker (drums) and Glenn Cornick (bass). Their first true experience on This Was was all directed toward british blues, although its style is enjoyable and kind of an acquired taste, this is an obvious work by still amateur musicians, though quite successful, it displays a certainly remarkable side of their music, in this case was blues, but the album still possesses too much of unconsistent textures, its style reach to be quite memorable and even boring, but with a certain cohersion present, few gems among their works can be remarkable in their blues fase, and these are the catchy, easy rythm and uncompromising \\"My Sunday Feeling\\", the fabulous atmosphere of the moody \\"Some Day The Sun Won't Shine For You\\", and the most famous, remarkable psychedelic side of blues present in \\"Song For Jeffrey\\", these are the songs that keep the album's best potential toward blues, and they may have reached to be considerable blues songs thanks for the incredible talent of a real blues player, Mick Abrahams, who also took part in the songs' composition, sadly, looking for a more folk, blues music, he left the band after this album. Most regarded as their first experience in british folk, its still interesting to see certain aspects of other genres' inclinnations throughout the album, like their more rock side slightly notorious on the melodic \\"Beggar's Farm\\" and most in the fierceful, aggressive \\"Dharma For One\\", which possesses one of Bunker's best drumming performance on his job with the band. And still, some jazz influence are not difficult to notice on the smooth but quite improvisational \\"Serenade To A Cuckoo\\" and the bonus track \\"One For John Gee\\". It's a good album for the start of such a talented band, but its still an album where they stand as amateur musicians, and that can be certainly notorious on its unconsistent textures and awkward musical approaches, but it isn't until Stand Up where they can be considerated serious musicians.m where they stand as amateur musicians, and that can be certainly notorious on its unconsistent textures and awkward musical approaches, but it isn't until Stand Up where they can be considerated serious musicians.

0071373586|5.0|I make every new employee read Positioning no matter what their job description because it is really a book about the \\"battle for the consumer's mind\\", and that battle is waged in every department of every organization.   Positioning is the rule book for marketing success and the great thing is all the examples. Yes they are somewhat dated, but they make the rules easy to understand.   This is the book nobody at Ford read before they redisigned the Taurus from number 1 in sales to a hole in the ground.    If you work in brand management or advertising you must read this book. It should be stashed in a \\"break-glass-get-book\\" thing at every exit of every ad agency.  If you are studying marketing at college, you should memorize every word in the book and major in something else, and come out with the equivalent of a double major.

Peter Sellers is funny in his role as \\"Evelyn Tremble\\" who is paired up with Ursula Andress's \\"Vesper.\\"  In some scenes the two share you can tell that she's trying her best to keep a straight face.<br /><br />Again, if you're hoping for a serious spy flick, pick up a \\"real\\" Bond flick, if you want to laugh your way thru a spy-spoof riddled with innuendo, then pick up a copy of \\"Casino Royale.\\"
B000002L71|4.0|I have a soft spot for this album, since it was what turned me on to the group in the first place. This isn't as good as the film (which, as several have stated before, is as good as concert videos get), or the full-blown soundtrack, but so what? Very cool. For one, it's got my favorite Talking Heads version of Take Me to the River - excellent studio version, but if you ask me it sounds better here, if just for the decrescendo/unexpected crescendo ending part. Also great is the acoustic Psycho Killer and an excellent take on Byrne's solo tune What a Day That Was. These are the bset, but really, everything's good: Swamp is as bizarre as ever; Slippery People, Girlfriend is Better and Burning Down the House are still funky, and will always be; Once in a Lifetime is... Once in a Lifetime, though that's one of those tracks where you NEED to see the accompanying live video footage. Life During Wartime is a bit of a disappointment, but that's only because the tense, suspenseful studio version makes for something hard to create on stage. My only problem is the lack of a couple great performances. I understand the limits of vinyl technology, but they had sufficent room to throw in Heaven and probably Cross-Eyed and Painless as well. This is almost useless now that the full-blown take exists, but it still has its purposes: it makes for a great start for the band if you're looking for something on the cheap; and it's a lot of fun.
6305428050|4.0|This movie is a lot of fun, and having recently seen it on DVD, I liked it as much as I did as a kid in the '80's. While I guess there was a bit of rough language a time or two that the movie could have done just as well without and which I can't for the life of me recall hearing when I used to watch this, Adventures in Babysitting holds up well today and should be a hit with new fans in this decade. Interesting how times have changed though since this film was shot. Nowadays cell phones would shake up the entire course of the plot, but it's contrasts like those that make this an enjoyable look back for those of us who were actually around back when this was a new show. Elizabeth Shue turns in a versatile performance as the babysitter in the title, and director Chris Columbus, who went on in later years to give us the classic Home Alone, and more recently a pair of Harry Potter movies, displays a few tricks that keep things from ever getting close to boring. Adventures in Babysitting is one to sit back and enjoy all over again.
B00000634J|5.0|This is sooooo close to being the final say on Lennon, along with Plastic Ono Band and Imagine. Two little switcheroos would've elevated it to that position. Off with Power to the People (seriously, what a crappy song!), and on with Steel and Glass. And while I understand including Stand By Me to represent Rock and Roll (which, incidentally, is pathetic) just for balance's sake, how about if we Bring on the Lucie here? The lack of God and Crippled Inside is a bit annoying, but as I said you really need Ono Band and kinda need Imagine (it's not in Ono Band's league, but it can be brilliant in spots).<br />Other than that, this has everything you need. Mother, Love, Working Class Hero, Imagine, Jealous Guy (my favorite Lennon song), Mind Games, Whatever Gets You Thru the Night, #9 Dream, Woman, Watching the Wheels, Borrowed Time, (Just Like) Starting Over, Happy Xmas (War is Over), the REAL Give Peace a Chance (not the gutted version on Shaved Fish), Cold Turkey, Instant Karma, Nobody Told Me... if you're wondering what the big deal about Lennon is, which obviously means you've been living in a cave on Pluto's moon Charon, this and pretty much every Beatles album will convince you of that.
B000TXG3YA|5.0|This is a message to the whole world: go get this album asap! All I can say is Baroness have created a new brand of metal! I'm not pulling your hair; the music contained herein sounds fresh and unique. Paradoxically, their influences do shine clearly and can even blind you sometimes. I would say this guys listen to older stuff, not all those bands they get compared to on the horrid sticker Relapse usually sticks on their cd boxes. I mean, yeah, maybe Mastodon, High on Fire and Isis- I don't really care: it's just an advertising strategy to call young kids' attention... Don't know how old these guys are, but if you asked me, I would compare them to excellent and timeless rock bands such as Thin Lizzy, Wishbone Ash, Maiden, Rush,Kyuss, a bit of K. Crimson, probably Sabbath, Helmet, Fugazi, and the Melvins!! Now, if you want newer stuff, I'd say Kylesa, Zebulon Pyke and Don Caballero (the album was produced by Kylesa's Philip Cope, and though loud and heavy, the sound's crystal clear, which can only help Baroness' melodic yet powerful and enticing sound)... This year has seen lots of great underground stuff released: The Hidden Hand, Mammatus, Tragedy, etc. But these guys have released an album that made me feel twenty years younger, when I wasn't old and jaded; I mean,I remember when I was 15 and excited about a new DRI, Voivod, COC or Celtic Frost album! Same exact feeling: as if I were part of a beautiful, reddish dawn. Something that calls forth paradoxical images of hope, longing, nostalgia, adventure and non-pathological solitude! Yes, indeed. I'm in a poetic mood thanks to this awesome music. In fact, I'm not even going to single out stand-out tracks, no sir! They're all great, from start to finish... Be forwarned, though: there's a different approach here, and those who are familiar with Baroness' earlier output will have to be prepared for a slight shock: the vocals are not crust-like anymore; in fact, they sound as if Ian Mackaye had morphed into Gene Simmons!Come to think of it, that spells King Buzzo territory in my book! Not a bad thing, but it takes time getting used to...Plus, the fast stuff, the hardcore riffs and speed are gone. That I don't like, but, really,Baroness have created an album that nowadays would be impossible to even imagine: something more akin to another era, or maybe another planet... 'Nuff said! Greetings from Mexico!
B00005LALD|1.0|Okay, even I'll admit I like \\"Stan\\". Great beats, for one; creative sample of Dido's hit \\"Thank You\\", and a chilling, fascinating portrait of a possessive, stalking fan. Even if some of it is a bit clunky, and even though the overuse of profanity is annoying, and even though there's some obnoxious, trite homophobia, I still enjoy the song - but it's more for the sample and beats than anything Eminem himself does. All right, that's one song of eighteen. Actually, fourteen if you want to get technical: four of them are idiotic skits. The rest is a joke: either obnoxious, self-centered pandering to the gangsta-rap trends (\\"Kill You\\"; \\"Kim\\"; \\"Criminal\\"; \\"Bitch Please II\\") or self-centered diatribes against the media and mainstream culture that make constant sneering reference to Em's record sales, all with awkward pop-culture references that are supposed to pass for humor (\\"Who Knew?\\"; \\"The Way I Am\\"; \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" - yes, Em, we understand you're a rare white rapper; \\"Remember Me?\\"; \\"I'm Back\\"; the acoustic \\"Marshal Mathers\\", which I'm sure is supposed to be \\"experimental\\" or something; \\"Drug Ballad\\") with often unimaginative musical backdrops (\\"Amityville\\" is the worst offender; \\"Kim\\" sounds like a moment from a bad movie soundtrack). There are so many guest stars it's hard to pick Eminem (whose voice annoys me, I should add) doesn't even appear until the fourth verse of the sexist \\"B*tch Please II\\". Em is nauseatingly sexist and homophobic: if it's supposed to be satirical (as I believe it is), it's not funny, and if it's what he really believes he's got major issues. Either way, this is one of the most overrated, overhyped, over-lauded albums I've ever heard: just an uber-extended single for \\"Stan\\" (which isn't exactly \\"The Message\\" or anything in the first place). Look, I'm not a huge fan of rap, but I'll admit there are talented rappers, mainly of the \\"Old-school\\" variety: anyone who considers Eminem the greatest rapper ever has obviously never heard of Chuck D. I could recommend a huge variety of classic rock, modern rock, jazz, blues, funk and R&B over this, but then I'd be accused of being a \\"musical elitist\\", wouldn't I?ck D.

B000286RKW|5.0|This movie is Terrific!  As far as mob movies go, I like it as well as the Godfather.  But I JUST BOUGHT THE THING ON THE CRAPPY ONE DISC EDITION!!  I THINK \\"WHY DID YOU NOT WAIT, YOU WHO HAVE LITTLE FAITH!!\\"  But I'm gonna by this movie again on two disc because it is totally worth it.  GOOD FELLAS ROCK!!
B000002J1B|4.0|After Topographic Oceans, progressive rock had lost all its respect. And Yes took the brunt of it, because Oceans was their creation, after all. That's where most band would break up, but Yes soldiered on and put out an album that's actually pretty good, considering the circumstances: Wakeman left, replaced by Patrick Moraz (who, erm... sounds like Rick Wakeman, I guess). There's one indisputable classic here, and that's the side-long, twenty-minute stunner \\"The Gates of Delirium\\", which is supposed to depict a battle. Whether or not it does, it's one of my favorite Yes tracks, about at the level of \\"Close to the Edge\\". The keyboard sound on that one is sweet. No other word for it. The next song is a disappointment: the abraisive, annoying \\"Sound Chaser\\". It's progressive industrial, and while some groups did good work with it, Yes bombs here, with failed tricks pulled such as a flamenco guitar played over heavy-metal riffs and a bunch of scatting near the end. That doesn't sound good at all. Then the next song redeems it: \\"To Be Over\\" is soothing and has all kinds of cool keyboard sound effects. I like it. This is overall a very solid piece of work - would've been better without \\"Sound Chaser\\", or maybe with Rick Wakeman on board, but then what do I know? Awesome cover art, too. Probably my favorite Yes cover.
B00015YVD6|4.0|I graduated college the year this came out. Hard to believe.  Anyway - it stood the test of time, despite some of the \\"dated\\" stuff.    My 2 tween-age daughters weren't as enamored by it as I expected. They liked the much more unremarkable Aquamarine instead.
B000089RV6|5.0|I'm gonna keep this simple, because this is simple music. Not \\"simple\\" as in \\"stupid\\", but \\"simple\\" as in \\"stripped-down, basics and nothing more\\". Lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass, drums and vocals. If you just wanna rock, what more do you need? I appreciate a lot of music, including some that most would deem \\"serious\\" (jazz; progressive rock; some classical), and I still would rank this as one of the twenty or so best albums ever made. Basically, this is the definitive AC/DC album (not to mention the best), so if you don't like this, you probably don't like the band much, either.<br />Now AC/DC made several fine albums: High Voltage, Dirty Deeds, Let There Be Rock, Powerage, Highway to Hell. This bests 'em all. Not a filler in sight. Not a wasted note. Quite to the contrary, in fact. You've got my favorite hard rock song ever made, You Shook Me All Night Long. You've got other radio favorites: the stomping title track, with an army of riffs; the menacing Hells Bells, much scarier than any stupid Slayer death-metal; you've got Shoot to Thrill, which is actually pretty intelligent composition-wise; and more basic rockers like What Do You Do For Money Honey and Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, with a well-placed buildup. One song I feel was unfairly lost in the shuffle is Have a Drink on Me, a very funny song that kicks butt like all the rest. And even the relatively weak tracks would've led the pack on any other album. Either they're brimming with enthusiasm (Shake a Leg; Given the Dog a Bone), or they're augmented with uberriffs (Let Me Put My Love into You). So this is great. If you don't have this, I've gotta request you put it on your shopping list. This ties with Who's Next as the best hard rock album ever made.
B00000JXVK|5.0|I saw this video in the mid 70's as a kid and you could even say it changed my life.  (No joke.)  This movie is the reason for motorcycles.   It's the reason I became interested in off-road motorsports and at 44 I am now sharing the trail riding experience with my 6-yr old son.  The humble smile of Malcolm Smith can not be put to words as he dazzles with his riding genious. This is THE cult classic that defines the concept of \\"soul riding.\\"  NO SELF RESPECTING MOTORCYCLIST SHOULD BE WITHOUT THIS DVD.  Period.  Chock full of spirit and simple pleasure, nothing encompasses the riding experience better than this movie.
B000P2A256|5.0|I love all their songs, I hope this isn't the last we hear from them.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|The wait is finally over. Jon Shaffer pulls it off again with his best concept album so far. I havent been a fan of iced earth very long (only since about 2/07)But i am about as diehard as they come. when i heard of \\"Framing armageddon\\" a couple of months ago i was overjoyed with the thought of new material. \\"Framing armageddon\\" tells a epic Si-Fi tale of astronomical proportions that is spread over a wopping 19 tracks. as for the musical features of the album, they are absolutly astounding! Though some people may not like the fact that Tim Owens is singing for Iced Earth, the Ripper truly delivers in this album. Brent Smidley is back on the brums again, and as fast and furious as ever. And as for for the metal master himself, he's still got it goin on. Jon Shaffer has to be the best rythem guitarist in the world. Not to mention his exelent song writing ability that truly shines on this album. I have to say, this is probobly Iced Earths softest album. But the softer songs such as the emotional \\"A charge to Keep\\" and the magnifecent \\"The Clouding\\", are trully what makes this album shine. they are Probobly 2 of the best power ballads you will ever here. I literally cried the first 10 or so times i listened to them, and still do. as for the harder stuff it is far from lacking. \\"Ten Thousand Strong\\" sounds twise as good as it did on overture of the wicked. other tracks such as the awsome \\"Setien Massacere\\" and the title trake \\"Framing Armageddon\\" are full of that fast,heavy thrashing Iced earth is known for. i could go on and on about how awsome this album is, but i would be typing for a while. this is hands down one of the best metal albums ive heard in a while, and i cant wait for the sequal next spring. a definant buy for any \\"Iced Earth\\" fan, or anybody else that loves good metal as much as i do. A great addition to any metal collection. Iced Earth Forever!!! Yeah!!!
B000RG1FMO|1.0|Boring, boring, boring.  Is this really the best that the well-regarded \\"dropout\\" can do?  Leave this snoozer of an album on the shelf, and go get some real music--NWA, Biggie, Tupac, Dre, Eminem in his thug days.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I love Kelly Clarkson.  I watched her through the show.  I love this album.  It is personal and fits her to the tee.  You also get to hear her sing different ranges that you don't normal hear.  I think she is a great singer and will go a long way.  I will continue to buy her music.
6305363668|5.0|Produced in 1982, this film was so far ahead of it's time but filled with enough realism it separated itself from the Star Wars saga that seemed to never end.   The acting alone is about as superb as you'll ever see. The lighting and film effects were enough that it didn't detract from the story of the movie as say a James Bond film does (IMO).   The film was later even used to base a White Zombie song on \\"More Human Than Human.  I would have liked to have seen at least one follow up to this film but unfortunately the writer died I believe before the movie was even made? It's also one of the first films ever released on DVD also (The Original Voice over version).   Captivating and star-studded it shows many at the very beginning of their careers.   Not only is this Harrison Ford's best performance but one that will make him endure through the years in Hollywood as a genuinely great actor.     The best part of the movie is it leaves you thinking about some of the pauses and unsaid things in the movie. One that's captured the attention of Bladerunner fans for many years was \\"is Harrison Ford's character a Replicant\\"? I found out the answer to that after watching the movie the second time ;).
B000FTWB7G|4.0|When the new Evanescence album came out, I was quite estatic. Since the release of \\"Fallen\\" in 2003, I had been eagerly awaiting some new material from the band. When the time came, 3 years later, I was more than ready to hear it.<br /><br />And, surprisingly, my first reaction was... what? As I eagerly listened to every track on the album, I couldn't help but feel... disappointed. Every song seemed the same, with no tantilizing beats or lyrics that engrossed themselves in your mind. Instead, everything seemed to blend together. Undefined.<br /><br />Many people attribute this to the lack of Ben Moody in the lineup. Supposedly, he was the principle song writer behind the \\"Fallen\\" album. I, however, attribute it to not listening hard enough.<br /><br />I liked the songs, however similiar they seemed, so I kept listening to them. As I did, something amazing happened. I began to distinguish them from each other, and I could feel the different atmosphere pulsating within each new song. I had been wrong, wrong indeed; each song did have it's own life, it's own beat and pulse to surrender.<br /><br />Overall, the tone of the album is similar to \\"Fallen\\", at least in my opinion. There's not much of \\"Origin\\" to be heard, it seems the band (or rather, Amy Lee at this point) has completely departed from their beginning sound. The songs have the same somewhat unhappy feel, and the lyrics are depressing and cliche. However, that is not to say the sound is bad, in fact, I rather appreciate the darker sound. It's just that it's the exact same sound, with few new elements to cherish. The only thing that bothers me now are the classic \\"emo\\" lyrics. Every song seems to be about the same thing, with the same phrases. But it's something I can overlook when I concentrate on the music alone.<br /><br />I rather enjoy this album, no matter the harsh things I said about it. If you are a fan of Evanescence (or rather, Amy Lee), I would suggest listening to/ purchasing \\"The Open Door\\". It's a continuation of their sound, not really evolving from the last album, but still progressing in the depth of new material.lly evolving from the last album, but still progressing in the depth of new material.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I personally think this is the best Dire Straits album that was made.  The song \\"Telegraph Road\\" reminds me a lot of where I grew up and always brings back memories.  Industrial Disease is just a great, amusing song.
B000ROALCG|5.0|It's the best. I think Marc did a great job bringing back the old school originals music the made Salsa what it is today. Hector Lavoe is a legend and all those who were part of that great FANIA family. No one else would have given \\"EL Cantante\\" the justice it deserved like Marc Anthony.
B000E5KJGQ|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time matched with one of the greatest playback formats available.  Full Metal Jacket is a rite of passage alongside 'The Godfather' and 'Scarface' that needs to have the best sound and video to go with it so you hear the crispness of every curse and vehement disgust the drill sergeant spews at the fresh meat at Paris Island.  It helps that HD DVD allows you to see every bit of spittle that goes with the screaming. Watch this movie, and if possible watch it in with and HD DVD player with a decent surround system with Dolby Digital capability and you will be stunned with it's greatness.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I think this is wahlbergs best yet.Some people may not like the violence but other than that you can't flaw this movie. Good acting and directing and a story that didn't get boring. I am always for the underdog.

0345360338|5.0|This is a continuation of the book \\"Here Be Dragons\\" which tells the story of King John of England's bastard daughter Joanna and her marriage to the Prince of Wales.  \\"Falls the Shadow\\" tells the story of their children and grandchildren in the fight with the Engish crown.  But mostly it tells the story of Simon de Montfort and his marriage to Henry III's sister Eleanor. It tells of his conflict with the monarchy.  It's a very interesting book.  A way to learn history without pain; with real interest in the personalities involved.  It is the first I was aware of the close kinship between the Welsh and the English by marriage - how interrelated they were.  A great book!

B000N4SHOE|4.0|I enjoyed the beautifully filmed and acted story of Beatrix Potter and also the additional information on her life and legacy. However, the DVD as a whole loses one star (I am tempted to subtract two) for the annoying intrusion of 15 minutes of commercials at the start.
B000O178BY|5.0|First Listen: \\"Meh\\" sounds like rehash, or left-overs from \\"Things Falling Apart.\\" Kind of flat, but worth another listen.

Third Listen: Wow, this has the structure of \\"The Downward Spiral\\", the beauty in \\"Fragile\\", the bites in \\"With Teeth\\", and some new progressive stuff.    Fourth Listen: OK, this is AWESOME! I gotta write a review on Amazon or something. Reznor is really got something great going here and N.I.N. is far from \\"oldy moldy.\\" I'm sure I'll be listening to this over and over again, and again, again....I LOVE IT!!!!!
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|I've seen the third Bourne movie three times now and I'm very much looking forward to it's video release so I can add it to the first two movies. Both of which are so well crafted - though by two different directors - that (with the additional of the third) they will make one of the most enduring movie trilogies (or series if we're so lucky as to get a fourth movie) ever created.<br /><br />Matt Damon throughly inhabits the character. The casting is perfect down through the extra's. The director(s) use the locations to great advantage. The cutting moves the action along at a blistering pace, yet in repeat viewings there are plenty of delightful discoveries to make that reflect the care put into the production.<br /><br />My only quibble is the excessive reliance on \\"shaky cam\\" (combat video) film-technique. Thankfully the effects of which are minimized on the small screen. While I think it adds excitement and energy, the flurry of camera movements distracts from the choreography of the martial arts in the second and third movies. Yes, it's a minor disappointment, but the fight scenes are very well-thought out and as carefully crafted as everything else in the production.<br /><br />On days when my own life seems incoherent, I can always put one of the Bourne movies in the DVD and spend a couple of hours with someone who always knows what he should do next and has the resources to pull it off.

0060989157|4.0|This book is a FUN read and I have no doubt that for the most part things went down exactly as described.  However I've also read Neil Strauss' other books and while a brilliant writer, he tend to make things larger than life and more polished than they really were (read the Game especially for examples of this.)  Some things in the book seem a little too \\"neatly\\" described and he glosses over some of the more negative aspects of Motley Crue (And I grew up with them and obsessively followed their press since I was in middle school.)    But definitely a thumbs up.  Look forward to reading Nikki's new book for comparison.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|Before I saw this film, I was not familiar with these actors or this director, nor am I much of a student of film, so I cannot comment from those perspectives.<br /><br />I was, however, raised on Johnny Cash, and my family has roots in cotton, the South, and some of those uneasy places where souls, love, God, and living on this earth either intersect or collide. Whether Phoenix and Witherspoon portrayed their characters with perfect biographical accuracy is unimportant to me. This film described and validated, as best as I might expect, my feeling of the essence of Johnny Cash, June Carter, and their life and times. Their spirits swirl through it.

B0006B2A42|4.0|As with any good espionage movie, the viewer is left to puzzle over who works for whom. As an added layer, better espionage films leave the viewer to wonder about who is playing whom.  Although this film has the elements of a better espionage film, it seems more of an afterthought.    This movie from the late 1960s is based in the Cold War conflict and has both the spy game as well as a submarine under the polar ice cap.  The movie spends almost too much time in the submarine and not enough at the ice station, but given the race to complete their objectives, this is probably more realistic.    Rock Hudson and Patrick McGoohan play their roles well and have the dialogue available to explore their roles.  Jim Brown is well suited to his role, but he wasn't given enough to fully show his ability.  Ernest Borgnine played the Russian defector, but his beret and accent made it difficult to see him as Russian.     This is not a blockbuster or an epic film (even though it plays an overture in the beginning and has an intermission).  It is a fairly good movie from the Cold War and is good for a casual view.

006085880X|5.0|This is the fourth book I have read by Jodi Picoult. So far, they have all been heart wrenching, insightful, thought provoking and compelling reads. Ms. Picoult has a way of getting inside the mind of her characters, especially the teenagers. I think one reason some people have problems with her plots or the actions of her characters (as some have said in this book) is that you really have to forget all of your adult feelings and go back to being a teenager. You have to go back to that time when acceptance was everything and you lived in the moment and each of those moments was so profound in your mind. As Emily states in this book, she sees herself now and she sees herself in ten years, but can't see how she can get from point A to point B.     This book takes on the issue of teen suicide. Parts of it are excruciating to read. Emily's thought processes seem illogical at times when filtered through the mind of an adult. At times I wanted to scream at her and tell her that wasn't the way to do it. This book makes us also wonder just how well we really do know our kids and reminds us that no matter how close we are to them, they do in fact have a life that is separate from us.     All in all, though parts are difficult to read, I highly recommend it, especially for parents of teenagers, and for teens themselves.

B0000CDL93|5.0|The assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 was one of the most shocking historical events in American history, much as Pearl Harbor and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were. Director Oliver Stone does an incredible job of re-creating the events and somber mood of that dark day and its aftermath by using real film footage shot by witnesses in Dealey Plaza, along with his own staged reenactments.    Whether you believe in an alleged vast (in my opinion, Stone's and Garrison's a bit too vast) conspiracy or Lee Harvey Oswald as the \\"lone nut\\" shooter, \\"JFK\\" should be seen for its historical content more than for its portrayal of real-life New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison's conspiracy-fueled investigation and resulting 1968-69 trial of Clay Shaw.    If nothing else, the film raises some interesting questions about who and what dark forces may have been behind the assassination, all the while keeping your attention with entertaining, fast-paced editing. While telling Jim Garrison's theory of the assassination, the film immerses the viewer into the socio-political mood of the late 1950's and early 60's-era dark and covert Mafia/CIA/FBI liaisons, presenting at times a documentary-style view of Cold War events, the U.S.'s escalating involvement in Vietnam, and its war on Castro's Cuba.     John William's soundtrack is beautiful and moving, and is successful in enhancing the mystery and intrigue of the film's content. The all-star cast with Kevin Costner in the lead role as Jim Garrison helps the characters appear familiar and likable, although I felt as if Stone tried too hard in getting all these familiar faces to appear in the movie because he figured no one would be interested in watching the 3-hour epic if he hadn't. Gary Oldman does an admirable job of emulating the stuttering and nervous Oswald, and Donald Sutherland utterly rivets you the screen with his soft-spoken stories of government black operations. Also noteworthy is Joe Pesci,who puts forth a psychopathic -- almost comedic -- portrayal of David Ferrie, one of the alleged conspirators. Sissy Spacek plays the troubled and frightened, but ultimately supportive wife of Garrison, and Tommy Lee Jones is in the role of the man on trial, Clay Shaw. Last but not least are the cameo-like appearances of huge stars Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, John Candy, and Kevin Bacon.     Watch the movie, maybe a few times. If nothing else you'll walk away more historically enlightened, maybe even asking some interesting questions about the assassination yourself. And, a Hollywood film that stirred a public outcry over alleged government secrecy surrounding the event, ultimately forcing it to release assassination records and form the 1992 Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) is in itself historically significant. This should make anyone want to see it.
0595440096|5.0|As someone whose only experience with Alzheimer's Disease is through multimedia exposure (cnn, newsweek, and the occasional tv movie) I found \\"Still Alice\\" to be enlightening from both a scientific and an emotional perspective.  I understood the deterioration of Alice's brain, but more than that, I was repeatedly moved by her battle with the disease and all its cruelty--while reading on the subway one morning, I found myself struggling to hold back tears.  Ms. Genova paints a beautifully human portrait that is accessible to all.  Her use of illusion and metaphor always serve to illuminate Alice's experience and seeing the disease through the eyes of its victim is wonderfully insightful.  I hope that this novel will soon find the large audience it deserves.
B000J10EQU|2.0|Being an 80s kid, I grew up watching the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, so I was a little skeptic about a new film, that obviously couldn't star the late actor. After all, how could anyone else play Superman than him?  I have to say, Brandon Routh did a decent job. If we couldn't get Christopher Reeve, he probably was the second best choice. You can tell he was very much influenced by the first 4 Superman movies, either when wearing cape or glasses.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Kate Bosworth, who I believe was a very poor choice to play Lois Lane. A 23 year old mother who is the Daily Planet's star reporter? Since Superman has been in outer space for 5 years, that means she was 18 when they were romantically involved. So she would technically still have been in journalism school then...  Kevin Spacey on the other hand does an excellent job playing Lex Luther. I was relieved to see the makers have opted to keep the Gene Hackman version and not replace him by some larger than life supervillian.  As for the story, this movie is somewhat of a sequel to the 4 Christopher Reeve films. Superman has been away for 5 years, looking for the remains of his home planet Krypton. During that time, Lex Luther has been released from jail, since the Man of Steel neglected to show up in court and Lois Lane has gotten romantically involved with another man and given birth to a son.  Luther has once again found his way to Superman's Fortress of Solitude and has stolen one of its crystals in order to wipe the United States out of existence and create a new continent that he can sell to the highest bidder. Sound familiar? In fact, the whole movie is full of references to the first film. It starts off with the exact same opening credits and score and Marlon Brando makes a few appearances from beyond the grave.   As for the look, the actors dress like in the 1930s, which, I guess, creates a nice journalistic feel, the Daily Planet's employees being the main protagonists inthe movie after all. It also makes for a kind of classic, timeless atmosphere. One thing it does not do, however, is recreate the magic of the first 2 Superman movies, which were set in the glitter and glamour world of the late 70s - early 80s. Lois Lane does not wear shiny evening gowns or live in a Metropolis penthouse, but looks like a (very young) house wife and lives in Wayne Manor. Granted, she's upset with Superman for having left her for five years without even saying goodbye, but there simply is no magic between Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth in the way that there was between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. This is clearly visible in the pretty lame flying sequence. Remember \\"Can You Read My Mind\\"? Well, not anymore, I guess. What happened to the lovely night time shots of Metropolis (Manhattan) or the beautiful wide open landscapes of the American West? I'd have thought that in these warlike days, it would have been nice to add a little patriotism to a Superman movie. After all, isn't he supposed to fight for truth and justice in the American way?  The special effects aren't all that great either, actually. Superman: The Movie may have been made almost 30 years ago but its flying sequences were a lot more credible than the flashes of red and blue or lame CGI effects that were used in Superman Returns. Christopher Reeve may have \\"only\\" lifted a helicopter to save Lois Lane in his first public appearance, it still had a much more heroic feel to it than when he threw a rocket into space and landed a plane in a baseball stadium this time around. I can't speak for all Superman fans out there but I did not go: \\"Yeah, he's back!\\" during the 2 seconds it took him to intercept the plane or his subsequent computerized hovering before the plane's entrance after having saved his favorite journalist.  One good aspect, though, is the slow pace, the sets and the music. The Fortress of Solitude and the farm where Clark grew up look and sound exactly the same as inthe first 4 films.  All in all, I guess you could say the actors, composer and even the director did their best and if we couldn't get another Christopher Reeve movie, I guess this still is a decent effort. Trouble is, the first films were just so magical every other take is bound to leave you feeling a little disappointed.

B00005JKED|5.0|This film deserves every one of it's accollades and is intelligent, realistic fiction with deep moral reflections.  Denzel, always fantastic; Ethan, seriously underappreciated.  The writing, directing, cinematography, and supporting players are superb.  If you haven't seen it, I urge you to refrain from reading too much about it beforehand.  Just go get it!      If you've seen it and are debating whether it's worth buying, let me attempt to convince you: I believe that there is enough in this film that you'll be able to pick up new details even after the 5th or 6th viewing, and can appreciate it more each time.  This is a psychological film with nuance, its characters so pushed and pulled, you'll begin to see in their faces every thought, spoken or unspoken.  Training Day is simultaneously realistic and artistic.     Harris is a supercool, charismatic, intimidating, streetwise detective unhampered by the pretentions of police protocol.  The filmgoer identifies easily with Hoyt, the new recruit, but squirms at his eagerness and timidity while sympathizing with his ambition and idealism.  Both characters are coming from opposite ends of the job, and one wants to believe they are both looking out for the interests of LA, and each other.  Harris' strong certainty, coupled with Hoyt's uncertainty, makes one want to trust more in the former.  He is, however, the devil incarnate -- a character on par with a Nurse Ratchet, only much more insidious and alluring -- using the hopes and fears of the mind to corrupt or destroy.  You just don't want to recognize it until it's too late, and Hoyt is upside down in a bathtub with a shotgun barrell in his mouth.
B000LC4CVA|4.0|If you simply like the music of Celtic Woman, then this DVD is 5 stars hands down. The music is beautiful, and the production is incredible.    If you are a sound or production tech, I highly recommend watching this just for the quality of the recording, micing, and staging. I personally would have EQed the violin a little differently, but everything else was a wonderful natural sound.    The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the sound was a few microseconds off from the video. Hardly noticeable to the average viewer, but extremely annoying to those of us who do notice. Also, there are no subtitles, but it has a subtitle track. The subtitle tract doesn't work, but it is there.    I can just imagine the irritation of those who sweated and agonized over making this such a wonderful presentation only to have the DVD processing company mess up the sound sync, and the subtitles.    Perhaps they fixed these flaws in later releases of the DVD, but I've verified that the version I have is due to a production problem. It isn't due to a flawed disk, or DVD player.

0446677450|5.0|This is a must read classic!  I've read this book when I was in college and have been reading Kiyosaki since then.  I've also been very resistant to the philosophies of this book until I though I got my \\"dream job\\".  Only then did I realize all of the lessons thought in this book:  - The laws are written for the Rich  - Middle class and poor are kept in the dark because of the philosophies about money and life they keep. Ex. Go to a good college, get a degree, and get a good job with benefits.  - The reason Middle Class in US is dwindling.    - The basic financial literacy which escapes most of us.  - Why your house is not an asset, and how it could be.    Whether you believe the story in this book or not - it will challenge many of your basic philosophies about money and life.  This book is not an answer to everything, then again there is not such thing.  Rich Dad, Poor Dad will make you think.  This is the book that will take off the blinders from your eyes, so you can now look in other directions and continue your research.  Then again, it is your choice to do that, or stay where you are.    P.S. About the \\"dream job\\" - there is not such thing.  Even the best job is still a job.  While I am still working and do enjoy my job to a degree, I am working on plan B and plan C so one day there will be no more \\"job\\" for me.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Irresponsible isn't my favorite Buble album and to be frank I was a bit disappointed when I first heard it. However, that said, it is still a great cd. It has grown on me, although the first half of the cd feels a bit flashy (they are called classics for a reason). I love Buble's original piece Everything and the title track is everything I have come to love about Buble. Also there is a great rendition of Willie Nelson's You Were Always on My Mind. I would definitely recommend this cd to any Buble fans. If you are new to the MB experience I would suggest starting with one of his earlier albums.

B00003CXA2|5.0|Year of release: 1994<br />Writers: Winston Groom (who wrote the novel) and Eric Roth<br />Director: Robert Zemeckis<br />Runtime: 2 hours 22 minutes<br /><br />I haven't seen this film for about 7 years or so. Seeing it again I was reminded why this is one of my all-time favorite pictures.<br /><br />THE PLOT: Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mildly retarded Alabaman who brushes shoulders with the key figures and events of the 50s through the early 80s. Due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing). Meanwhile, the one woman he loves in all the world, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), flounders through life hopelessly trying to find fulfillment in the drug culture with all the wrong people.<br /><br />&#34;Forrest Gump&#34; is hugely entertaining on every level. It's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements. If you've never seen it, don't think for a second that this is some average romantic comedy or goofball comedy. Far from it. I don't watch the Acadamy Awards or give any creedance to their judgment (&#34;American Beauty,&#34; best picture? Please) but &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; is one instance where they were absolutely right in regard to the Best Picture award.<br /><br />Some have criticized the film as an imbecilic fantasy, arguing that a simpleton like Gump would never become successful. It's true that the picture exagerates Forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals WHY he experienced continued success throughout his life. We can all learn from these little gems of wisdom:<br /><br />-- Whatever your I.Q., zero in on the areas for which you have a real talant.<br /><br />-- Focus on those gifts and master them. In other words, don't be a jack of all trades. This is in line with the Russian proverb: &#34;If you chase 8 rabbits you'll catch none.&#34;<br /><br />-- Mastering your talants will take HARD WORK (which explains why lazy people are never wealthy, unless they inherit it).<br /><br />-- Whatever you do, do it WITH ALL YOUR HEART.<br /><br />-- Love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e.g. Jenny, Bubba & Lt. Dan). Loyalty is underrated.<br /><br />-- Be patient and slow to judge (unless someone abuses another person).<br /><br />-- Allow others the freedom to choose and make mistakes, even if it seems like it takes forever for them to learn from them.<br /><br />-- If something or someone STINKS, reject it and stay away from it (remember the prostitute?).<br /><br />-- Keep your word.<br /><br />-- Pray and have FAITH.<br /><br />-- Keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become.<br /><br />We can also learn lessons from Jenny: Trying to attain fulfillment through loose sex and foreign substances is a LOST cause. Recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i.e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you); stay away from people who use and abuse you.<br /><br />From Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with God to find true peace, success and reconciliation. Dan's all-out fight with God on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and REAL. The great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with God: Most of the book of Job shows Job arguing with the Almighty and wanting to put Him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!); When God finally answers him Job falls to his face in humility and reverence. Jacob fought with God all night; the next day the Lord changed his name to Israel, which means &#34;struggles with God&#34; (Genesis 32:22-30). Also, remember Jesus' struggle with God and His will in the Garden of Gethsemane?<br /><br />Another thing we can learn from Lt. Dan is that he was able to recognize a &#34;golden connection&#34; in Forrest. No one makes it alone, no one. They had help. Despite Forrest's lack of academic smarts, Dan recognized his wisdom and greatness; it attracted him and he respected it. Because of his link to Gump he became hugely successful. Remember: &#34;One day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor.&#34;<br /><br />Late in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fiance at Gump's wedding. Note how Dan LOOKS at Forrest when they greet each other. Dan shows the utmost love and respect for Gump and is in utter awe of his simple-minded greatness. (This is great acting on Sinise's part).<br /><br />&#34;Forrest Gump&#34; is a film gem to be RELISHED on many levels. Not only will you be incredibly entertained, you may learn a thing or two.te in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fiance at Gump's wedding.

B000LAZDQA|3.0|I wish Amazon's rating system allowed half stars. I'd be tempted to give Shortbus 3 1/2 because I do appreciate Mitchell's attempt to treat sex matter-of-factly in an actual (and mostly engaging) movie. I also really liked his previous work, \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" and wanted to be able to throw my support behind an innovative independent artist. As it stands though, my disappointment in what came across as the larger message of *this* movie can't help but override my feelings of goodwill.     The thing that bugged me in this film (bugged me in a big way) was the divorcing of sexual fulfillment from connection with loved ones. Without giving away plot particulars, I found it actually kind of distressing that key characters wind up only being able to find real sexual gratification with strangers. In a movie that's supposed to be about finding acceptance, that seems like a curious message.     Is this really Mitchell's view of \\"utopia\\"? Of friendship? That it's, what, *preferable* to share your vulnerability with strangers while shutting out and not communicating with...the people who love you and care about you and actually deal with your crap on a day-to-day basis?    It's extra bothersome, because I thought this was an engaging film in other respects -- some uneven acting and writing aside. There was a lot of promise here, and I want there to be a place for films that treat sex as a legitimately important topic. I only wish the end result didn't feel like its conclusions were so self-centered and emotionally immature.
0810993139|5.0|Similar to the classic \\"Ramona\\" and Dear Mr. Henshaw books from decades past, this story is fun and moves well. There are the typical few family and friend supporting characters, so you don't get overwhelmed with a web of names to rememeber. Each day has great pictures that go along with it and add a splatter of authenticity and a trill of humor. This would make a great gift for any middle schooler who can take the joke of the title and not be self concious!

So stupid dialogue pacing, idiotic characters, camera angle, editing, cinematography, acting, story telling, directing, everything is the worst I've ever seen.

It's well-written and easy to read and understand.  I especially appreciated T. Colin Campbell's candor and willingness to tell it like it is.  I wish I had this information 30 years ago!
B0000DKMK0|5.0|This is Q's uncut masterpiece. It has another 2 minutes worth of footage as to what the distinction is in running times between the Japanese 113 min and the US 111 min version. But the big difference is the House of Blue Leaves in color. Full throttle blood and guts color. The US MPAA forced the washing out of the coloring of blood into gray splattered effects with The Crazy 88's. I mean come on just because it's gray and not red really means anything?!? We all know that it's BLOOD. Just like when Hitchcock filmed Psycho in B & W to avoid the mental challenges of the public of seeing the shower scene in living color.    This was the first dvd I got from another country to play on my region free dvd player back in '04. It's one among many now. I only wish that in the supplement sections when the Japanese artists are speaking about what they did in their own language, that there were English subtitles to what they're saying.    I really hope that the Japanese artists get their full due in the upcoming Whole Bloody Affair; since none of them showed up on the US dvd version. On the dvd set and their words translated into English. Especially in regards to their incredible detail within the Japanimation section of this movie.

B0000009N1|5.0|I think I'm finally ready to review Frank Zappa's Hot Rats!  I seriously had to listen to the entire album about five times before I could really write anything about it, seeing as how it's one of the most complex, interesting and challenging rock albums I've ever heard.  There's only six songs total, and each one offers some pretty exciting and creative musical ideas that really no other musician had attempted before this albums release in the early 70's.      \\"Peaches en Regalia\\" is a short instrumental, almost pop-flavored little track that offers a variety of musical instruments -all played with tons of melody- in a very short time.  It doesn't really sound as silly as lots of other Zappa songs.  It's about as creative as it gets.    \\"Willie the Pimp\\" is my favorite track.  It's one of the coolest-sounding guitar jams you'll ever hear.  Trust me, I love guitar jams.  Whether it's the smokin' 24-minute version of \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" by Fleetwood Mac from the Live in Boston CD, or anything from the Live Cream Volume 1 disc, I simply love guitar jams.  I believe \\"Willie the Pimp\\" stands alongside the very best.  It's super melodic, and the only song on the album to feature vocals (for only a couple minutes, if that) about, well, the life of a pimp!  I didn't know pimps were around back in the early 70's.  Just an awesome song.    \\"Son of Mr. Green Genes\\" is a really interesting track because there's almost a somber tone to the entire track, but it's mixed with layers of guitar solos and the entire thing ends up being one exciting guitar jam (though definitely not the same kind of guitar jam as the previous track).  Once again the amounts of creativity are overwhelming, and because of how melodic the entire track is, it ends up being one spectacular listen.  The little bits of instrumental variety throughout the 9-minute track makes it even tastier.    \\"Little Umbrellas\\" is sort of like \\"Peaches en Regalia\\" except not quite as creative.  Still, it's melodic and definitely not filler or anything.  It belongs here and I love it anyway.    \\"The Gumbo Variations\\" is probably the best song on the entire album.  You will hear a saxophone jam for about 6 and a half minutes, which then leads into a burning hot violin workout.  Then some heavy guitar to end the masterpiece.  Truly an incredible ride.  Once you get into it, you will realize 17 minutes doesn't seem that long after all.    \\"It Must Be a Camel\\" is another experimental track.  It's funny how musicians back in the 70's weren't afraid to be experimental on several occasions, however, none of them would release an entire albums worth of bizarre experimental ideas as much as Zappa would on Hot Rats.  A classic album.  People who don't like Zappa's wacky sense of humor would probably like this album, because it feels more serious than other stuff he's released over the years.  Fans of guitar jams will find plenty to like on here as well.  Well worth owning.

B000RG1FMO|4.0|Kanye develops more and more as an artist with each LP.  Graduation is proof that he can contend with some of the best MCs lyrically.  I personally hate his attitude...but I love his music.  Although this may not be his best album production wise, it is definitely his best lyrically.  He brings something new with every album and Graduation is no exception.  Creatively, there is no one in hip-hop better than Kanye West and that can be seen on tracks like \\"Stronger\\", where he takes one of Paris electronic group Daft Punk's songs and samples it to make a hit.  Very few producers or artists look overseas and in different genres for samples and inspiration, and that's what makes Kanye stand out. Although he is not one of the top 5 MCs on my list (like he declares to be on one of his tracks).  His production skills now compliment his rhyme style instead of it being the other way around, like it was on his last two albums.    Top 3 tracks (that aren't already singles):  1.  Big Brother (great lyrics and wordplay)  2.  Flashing Lights (best beat on the album)  3.  Barry Bonds (simply b/c Weezy kills it)    Bottom 3 tracks:  1.  Drunk & Hot Girls (what the h*** was he thinking on this one?)  2.

B00005V9IK|5.0|well judging by the the other reviewers.  im in complete agreement...this generations classic science fiction motion picture.   from start to finish ....well made , great, ahead of its time for yes its special effects and to a degree .....like some of the explosions of goverment buildings yet to be surpassed even by todays standards. you cant get a more exiting movie than this.....yes some of it is old fashioned and yes some of it is far fetched .....but thats fine....their should more like it.   i was grateful enough to meet dean devlin in hollywood a few years ago and you could not meet a more graceful and kind gentleman  ...it is not be chance this wonderful movie was one the great worldwide box office success.. the people will let you know .  you cant help but cheer for it in spite of its self.  in closing this generations ...classic science fiction movies.  an all time great that will stand the test of time.    thank you dean devlin and rolland emerich.
0743486285|5.0|As an author ([[ASIN:0975430408 Selections from the Serial Killer Cookbook (The Handbook for America's Youth)]]) that goes to great lengths pull skeletons out of my own closets, it is nice to see another do the same. I read through this in a few short sittings and had a really hard time putting it down. Compelling, honest, with warts and all included. Many in the position of Mr. Sixx would laugh at the idea of sharing their sordid past with the public but most are more concerned with their relationship with the press than with their fans. Sixx does a great job of making his fans, addicts, recovering addicts, and his readers aware of where his head was (or wasn't) at during this dark period in his life.<br /><br />The Heroin Diaries is written in such a human way that it is very easy for anyone to relate to. It is also nice to have the commentary by those other than Nikki that were present throughout this journey. Their comments, good and bad, really make the reader wake up to the horrors of this kind of situation. A great read, and [[ASIN:B000SM7QUC The Heroin Diaries]] soundtrack is a good listen as well.
0743289412|1.0|Steven King has not written anything of value in years. I used to thoroughly enjoy his earlier work. Over the years he has had  the ability to begin with an initial provocative idea.  However, his  recent novels wind up going NOWHERE. The details are unendingly boring and go on and on ad nauseum...   I tried Cell and at times ,I found myself laughing at the inanity of it. I vowed never to read another of his novels, only any short stories - if he could limit his excruciatingly wandering prose.     I  picked up Lisey's Story based upon some good reviews by publications that I have valued( Hah! ) with the thought that it might be a gem ...unlike his recent work. However, after a hundred pages or so I found myself enjoying it as much as I would having to walk  through waist-high mud. I tried in vain to finish it but alas, could not - it was so BORING !     I would think that if his name hadn't been on this novel it would've been sent back postage owed .       Goodbye Mr. King, your run is over ...

1594489505|4.0|Reading the Kite Runner made me an instant fan of Khaled Hosseini. I couldn't wait to dive into this book.<br /><br />Where The Kite Runner was from a boy-turned-man's point-of-view, this story is there to show a girl-turned-woman's point-of-view. The story effectively depicts the treatment of women in recent history. It was (not surprisingly) well written.<br /><br />I have told dozens of people how the Kite Runner is on my top 5 of all time, but I would *not* say that about this book. Perhaps I am too critical, but I was hoping for a different storyline. The formula for this book was similar to the Kite Runner, although different enough to make it a compelling read.<br /><br />I enjoyed this one, but it held few surprises for me as the story developed. Similar recipe, similar story.

B0000VD04M|5.0|WRITTEN BY Mark Bourne (bourne@dvdjournal.com) AND POSTED BY ME FYI    Buena Vista Home Video's long-delayed DVD release of Ed Wood makes the wait worthwhile. The source-print and anamorphic transfer keep the film's beautiful black-and-white cinematography right on target. For such a recent A-list film, the print shows a surprising amount of minor speckling, a little dirt, and some wear. The flaws are not show-stoppers at all, though videophiles aching for \\"pristine\\" are forewarned.    The chief attraction among the extras is the informative and entertaining commentary audio with Tim Burton, Martin Landau, writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, and costume designer Colleen Atwood. It's only occasionally scene-specific, and everyone except the two writers was recorded individually. All participants contribute well as they chronicle the project from its inception through its development and shooting. Burton is chatty and sounds quite pleased to talk about Wood's films (\\"like weird dreams\\" that are almost \\"poetic\\" in their badness), Wood himself, and what attracted Burton to him. Burton and the writers laud Depp's performance. We get Landau's thoughts on characterization, plus good summaries on the casting and the unexpected technical challenges posed by shooting a modern film in black-and-white. Alexander and Karaszewski, talking together in the most scene-specific segments, separate the film's facts from their fictionalizations, and relate what started them thinking about Ed Wood and his passion for movie-making.    The Bonus Material menu begins with a Music Video choreographed by Toni Basil (\\"Hey Mickey\\") and co-directed by Burton. This Ed Wood A-Go-Go oddity uses Howard Shore's main title music straight up and gives it to a Vampira-like, hair-swirling dancing girl on a Woodian graveyard set. She's accompanied by period-cheesy video effects and clips from Wood's films and Burton's feature.    \\"LET'S SHOOT THIS F#*%@r!\\" Not your typical behind-the-scenes featurette. With no post-production gloss and no talking heads, we get instead long home-movie takes of Burton at work with Depp, Landau, and others shooting scenes such as the Plan 9 recreation and Landau's wet rubber-octopus fight. It's scored with Shore's title theme. While on the set costumed in his \\"seven veils\\" drag garb, Depp steps up to the camera for an impromptu intro and closing. Just raw footage with no promotional rah-rah built in, this one's a welcome change from the usual over-produced \\"making-of\\" marketing fluff.    \\"THE THEREMIN\\" Composer Howard Shore gives us a primer on his score and how he used the fascinating 1920s electronic instrument that provided the ghostly oooo-weee-ooo vibe of so many 1950s sci-fi films. Theremin expert Mark Segal demonstrates how the instrument is played by moving your hands through the space between two metal rods.    \\"MAKING BELA\\" Here's a tribute to Lugosi from Ed Wood's two Oscar-winners. Actor's actor Martin Landau discusses his studious approach to the character of Bela Lugosi. Intercut with Landau, makeup supervisor Rick Baker tells us why he would have worked on this \\"labor of love\\" for free if he had to. We also get footage of the real Bela and a peek into Landau's dressing room while the layers of makeup are being applied to his face.    \\"PIE PLATES OVER HOLLYWOOD\\"  Production designer Tom Duffield hosts this look through his production sketches and Polaroids. He addresses the difficulties of shooting in black-and-white with enough depth to make this extra useful for burgeoning art directors.    Five DELETED SCENES Not much was lost in these cuts, with two just trims from the octopus-stealing scene. Footage of Bunny's dirgeful parade with his mariachi band while singing \\"Que Sera Sera\\" through the meat-packing plant might have been an off-script throwaway, as there's no hint about where it might have appeared in the film. Other cuts give us more material on Wood and Lugosi, plus Eddie having dinner with Tor Johnson's disapproving family.    Amusing animated menus and the theatrical trailer are here too.        * Black-and-white      * Anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1)      * Single-sided, double-layered disc (SS-DL)      * Dolby Digital 5.1      * Subtitles in Spanish      * Music video (3:28)      * Featurette: \\"Let's Shoot This F#*%@r!\\" behind-the-scenes footage        (13:56)      * Featurette: \\"The Theremin\\" (7:23)      * Featurette: \\"Making Bela\\" (8:14)      * Featurette: \\"Pie Plates over Hollywood\\" (13:49)      * Five deleted scenes (7:50 total)      * Theatrical trailer      * Keep-case

However, I think his purpose was to educate readers about Afghanistan and its history.  While this was a problem for me as a reader (I prefer historical novels to wear their history more lightly), I do think this is a good book for Americans to read, simply because most of us (myself included) know so little about this part of the world.  I can see it as a successful movie.

1881273156|5.0|This is by far the most helpful book I've ever read on relationships.  Chapman approaches relationships in a unique way that doesn't simply divide men and women into separate categories, but treats every person as a unique individual.  Regardless of your gender, you give and understand love through one or more primary 'love language'.  Certain of the following ways in which love is shown are most important to you.<br /><br />Words of Affirmation<br />Quality Time<br />Acts of Service<br />Physical Touch<br />Receiving Gifts<br /><br />Problems arise when you and your significant other don't speak the same 'love language'.  If you can learn to love your partner in the way that has the largest effect on them, they will feel more loved and hopefully reciprocate in kind.  Chapman's theories have stood up to the test of time and demonstrated their effectiveness time and again in many people's lives (just look at all the 5-star reviews).<br /><br />This relatively short book is written in a very engaging and easy-to-read style that will keep you entertained as well as seriously make you think about the ways you and your partner demonstrate your love.  Whether you're in a rocky relationship that is in desperate need for help, or in an excellent one that you couldn't imagine going wrong, I think this book could help you.  Whether you're married, dating (like me), single, Christian, atheist, straight, lesbian, or gay, I think this book could really influence the way you think about your relationships.<br /><br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
0553383663|5.0|This founding and growth of Google is a fascinating story.  While this book is very boosterish in its approach, that is fine.  We understand what is going on and it is inevitable that the \\"dark side\\" of Google will come out elsewhere.  Still, at its core and in the surrounding landscape, it is a pretty happy story.<br /><br />Larry Page, a Ph.D. student at Stanford, wanted to download the Internet to his computer and thought he could do it quite easily and quickly.  He met Sergey Brin, also a doctoral student at Stanford, was also interested in working with vast amounts of data, what could be learned from it, an how to organize it.  Page came up with the PageRank algorighms that ranked the searches in ways that made them more useful to the person doing the search.  (The name is a pun on Larry PAGE and web PAGE).<br /><br />Stanford approached a number of organizations and venture capitalists to sell the technology, but there were no takers.  So, Brin and Page dropped out and started their own company, which became Google.  They have always focused on their corporate culture being innovative, oriented towards small teams, doing interesting things and only later worrying about how to make money with whatever comes of the research, and doing the best to live by their motto \\"Don't Be Evil\\".<br /><br />They didn't follow the normal rules for raising money from the Venture Capital community, but were able to raise $25 million.  They promised the VCs they would hire a CEO, but put it off for more than a year and when they did accept Eric Schmidt (because the three of them got along) they would not ever report to him nor would they cede control to him.  When they finally had to go public (the VC stuff, again), they didn't follow the prescribed and traditional methods the investment banks use and only paid them half their usual fees.<br /><br />Yes, going into China caused them real spiritual difficulties, and still does.  And their goal of gathering all the information in the world and making it available does raise serious questions about personal privacy and freedom that they have not adequately addressed.  However, they have great technology.  I do use it and love Google Desktop.  The book provides some tips about ways to use Google you may not know.

0380799006|5.0|This book reads like a novel.  I literally could not put it down, staying up way past my bed time and paying the price the next day.  It describes a multi-week workshop that the author held.  Each week there are stories from the parents, ideas from the lecturer, questions, problems, hearts being poured out, family stories, including the tales of the adults (now parents) who survived difficult sibling situations.  You get to know some of the people in the workshop, and you live through the ups and downs of applying workshop ideas to their families. You want things to end well and you wait with abated breath for what happens next.<br /><br />On top of that, the ideas are eye-opening, life-changing and at the same time so obvious!  Like, how could I fail to see that?!<br /><br />Never have I encountered such an excellent read in parenting books, nor, come to think of it, any non-fiction that comes to mind.  Just don't start reading it at night!  You could be a very cranky mommy in the morning!
0784011680|5.0|Downey's performance in Chaplin is a one-man tour de force. Done at a time before Downey's own problems started creating problems for his acting career, it is probably the role for which he will be best remembered. Downey shows Chaplin to be a complex, multifacetted man who had many both good and bad qualities, but most importantly, was a creative and even visionary artist whose approach still couldn't halt the advent of the talkies. As Downey says in the movie, \\"If the little tramp speaks, the mystery is gone.\\" But for better or for worse, the technology and the art of cinema were taking off in a different direction, after which it would never be quite the same. Overall Downey's best movie and one that should stand the test of time.<br /><br />Byt the way, this is an interesting snippet from a brief bio of Chaplin's life from the IMBD website, which I thought I'd post here:<br /><br />\\"In contrast to many of his boisterous characters, Chaplin was a quiet man who kept to himself a lot. He also had an \\"un-millionaire\\" way of living. Even after he had accumulated millions, he continued to live in shabby accommodations.<br /><br />In 1921 Chaplin was decorated by the French government for his outstanding work as a filmmaker, and was elevated to the rank of Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1952. In 1972 he was honored with an Academy Award for his \\"incalculable effect in making motion pictures the art form of the century.\\" In 1975 England's Queen Elizabeth II knighted him. Chaplin's other works included musical scores he composed for many of his films. He also authored two autobiographical books, \\"My Autobiography\\" in 1964 and its companion volume, \\"My Life in Pictures\\" in 1974. Chaplin died of natural causes on December 25, 1977 at his home in Switzerland.<br /><br />In 1978, Chaplin's corpse was stolen from its grave and was not recovered for three months; he was re-buried in a vault surrounded by cement. Charlie Chaplin was considered one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of American cinema, whose movies were and still are popular throughout the world, and have even gained notoriety as time progresses. His films show, through the Little Tramp's positive outlook on life in a world full of chaos, that the human spirit has and always will remain the same.ma, whose movies were and still are popular throughout the world, and have even gained notoriety as time progresses.

B000002J6F|5.0|Having blazed a trail of FM classics in The Buffalo Springfield, Crosby Stills Nash/Young, and on his first two solo albums, Stephen Stills ended the most first and most creative phase of his career with a bang on the debut Manassas album.  With the exception of one or two of the pedestrian C&W cuts on the \\"Wilderness\\" section, this album is solid from start to finish; working with the *other* talented Byrdsman Chris Hillman lent the album welcome touches of bluegrass and harmony pop.  There are too many highlights to mention but \\"Song Of Love\\", \\"Bound To Lose\\", \\"So Begins The Task\\" (incredible pedal steel work here), \\"Bound To Fall\\", \\"Move Around\\" (amazing ballad with cosmic synth stylings), \\"The Treasure\\" (all-out rock jam!) and \\"Blues Man\\" all shine.  That Manassas is a relatively overlooked and (although that's changing, as seen by the reviews here) underrated album in the catalog, with only the wonderful \\"Johnny's Garden\\" seeing radio play, makes it even more of a find.  In any case, what you'll find here is an American fantasia, spanning country, folk, blues, pop, rock, latin and psychedelia in equal measure.  It is the ultimate Stills album, and it's no wonder that Bill Wyman said he was tempted to quit the Rolling Stones to join this band.
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|In the opening track to `The Sufferer & the Witness' they make the statement that \\"this is noise\\" before they barrel into the brutal opener `Chamber the Cartridge'.  Now, for the most part that statement is true.  This album is loud, booming, in your face noise.  But can't it be said that any sound is noise, any style of music, no matter how melodic or how abrasive it truly is?  If that's the case then we just have to determine what type of noise best suits your eardrums.  For the emo/punk/numetal generation of head bangers this collection of noise may just be what the doctor ordered.  In fact, `The Sufferer & the Witness' is one of the noisiest albums I've heard in quite some time, but each and ever vibration is above and beyond rewarding.  Yes, Rise.Against have truly risen to the occasion and developed and delivered a brilliant crafted album.<br /><br />So let's start with the singles, the first of which was `Ready to Fall'.  This track is a great introduction to the band; it's probably their most accessible track here while still maintaining their signature sound.  It's a great anthem for teen angst with thoughtful lyrics that match their presentation well.  To me though, `Prayer of the Refugee' is a much superior track.  The shift change within structure from the verses to the chorus is magnificent.  The chorus is so engulfing, so catchy and so memorable.  Their latest single `The Good Left Undone' follows that same pattern and works just as well.  The ending of the song alone is fantastically done.  I'm just loving the lyrics to this track especially.<br /><br />Aside from the great singles `The Sufferer & the Witness' contains excellent tracks to stand on their own.  Songs like `Injection' have a much more melodic approach to them and come across more commercial than the balance of the album.  In fact, `Injection' would make a more understandable single than some they've selected in my opinion.  `Under the Knife' is not one of my favorite tracks.  It sounds different from the majority of their stuff and the chorus is a little too boring in my opinion.  Some have raved over it being to catchy but I just didn't get into it.  The bridge though is pretty cool; the steady progression of music, but then it falls back into that chorus that is just not that wonderful.<br /><br />They get political on `Drones' (doesn't every band have to broach this subject).  The track is really well done.  The guitar work is exciting and blisteringly straightforward.  Songs like `Brick' are just a little too punkish for my taste.  It's almost like early Green Day and while that noise may please someone else it doesn't really meld with my happy center anymore.  Now on `Worth Dying For' they use the speed of the verses well by slowing down and mellowing out the chorus and it actually turns into a very well rounded track, one of the best here.  `Behind Closed Doors' is almost too mellow though for what I've come to expect from this album, although it has some really nice musicianship.<br /><br />`The Approaching Curve' is a strange song coming from them with spoken word throughout the verses and very melodic chorus lines, but the guitar work is awesome and the lyrical message is very impressive.  `Roadside' is one of the deepest tracks here and its importance is magnified by the simplistic approach to its delivery, clean guitars and harmonious vocals.  It's actually a quite beautiful song, not something I'd expect off this album but it was a truly delightful surprise.  The closing track `Survive' gets right back into the brutality we expect from the band and it's a brilliant way to close out an album filled with highlights and surprises.  So, the question is what type of noise you prefer.  If this is your preference then sit back and enjoy what may be the best collection of noise pollution you'll come across.e majority of their stuff and the chorus is a little too boring in my opinion.

I thought the technique of shifting back and forth between Eva's wartime adventures and the current period (though the whole book is evidently a flashback to the 70's)when she reveals her exciting past to her daughter was very well done and made this a compelling read. In some respects, this book reminded me of several of Alan Furst's or Ward Just's novels. Well researched and with a real element of suspense.

0316067598|5.0|This book should be required reading for every American who loves our country, and has great difficulty swallowing the defeatist garbage that our liberal/socialist media (print & broadcast) spews out daily.  We  need to realize just how much our sons and daughters, in the greatest military establishment in the world,  are really putting themselves through to allow us (both patriot and the clueless) to live \\"free\\"in this wonderful country.    Bob
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|As a mother of boys, I am always looking out for movies about boys that will hold interest and give a positive theme. The Karate Kid is just perfect! It has a few curse words, but they ARE few. My boys range from 15 years to 6 years, and they all stayed with this one. Yes, the cheesy 80's styles and music were good for a chuckle or two, but otherwise the message is timeless. Enjoy!!  Note: My boys enjoyed the second one aw well...
0316067598|5.0|I live very near Coronado and know a friend of Marcus Luttrell's.  He didn't want to make a dime off of this book.  He had to let people know of his comrades' heroics and patriotism so that they would never be forgotten.      At Marcus' request, any and all proceeds go directly to the families of the fallen SEALs.  So, please buy new if you can, instead of saving a couple of bucks on used.      It's an awesome book and although I've always been a huge supporter of our troops, I have an even deeper appreciation and respect for them after reading this book.      HOOYAH!  Duty, Honor, Country!  Thank God they're on our side!  And thanks to all of our troops - past, present and future - for serving this great country.  GO U.S.A.!
B0001AP12G|4.0|Finally, the long awaited debut of Mr. West, or as he like to put it \\"A man named West\\". After waiting through a motor accident, a push back of the original release date, and him literally rapping \\"through the wire\\" for months before the CD FINALLY hit shelves, it was one of the most anticipated releases of it's year. Thankfully it did not dissapoint.   The open is with Deray chiding Kanye about making a speech to his classmates about graduating, or as he said \\"make the children want to start jumping around and sharing candy and stuff\\"... Kanye, in true Freshmen 'i know it all me against the world' fashion proceeds to open with a song of empowerment with \\"We Don't Care\\", an inner city proclamation of 'we used your lemons and made lemonade' of self empowerment. Of course, he's kicked out the assembly, but just the same, point across. He then proceeds to ramble, in true freshman format, about everything important to him, like \\"All Fall Down\\" with Syleena Johnson, working OT on \\"Through the Wire\\", throwing a basement jam with Twista and J Foxx on \\"Slow Jams\\", and of pure brotherhood with Jay-Z on \\"Never Let Me Down\\"... Comedic in nature, we find Kanye' and friends accused and used by the Gap and the mall (If my manager insults me again/I will be assaulting him... Back to the Gap/look at my check, wasn't no scratch/So if I stole, wasn't my fault/yea I stole, never got caught/Took me to the back and pat me/asking me about some Khakis/But let some black people walk in, watch them show off they token Blackey/Oh now they love Kanye', put him all in the front of the store/ So i'm on break, next to the no smoking sign with a blunt in the mall\\"... hilarious. He even takes us to Sunday School with the Rhymefest inspired \\"Jesus Walks\\"... The 2 standout tracks to me were \\"Two Words\\" with Freeway and Mos Def (who crafted entire bars with only 2 words), and the \\"Last Call\\" which was a musical auto biography that shows you how hard that man worked to get here. the ONLY reason this cd did not get a 5 is because Jimmy KEPT popping up, annoying me to know end. Other than that, a great Freshman year offering, and well deserving of the Mascot head on the cover.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|A classic to enjoy for years to come.Some people might not get it but that's OK.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Clearly this is his greatest effort to date. To be honest, and fair, his best album was Late Registration, hands down. In much the same manner as the best ball is played BEFORE a kid reaches the pros, the same applies here. However, just like a pro player, this is a polished effort. He clearly has in sync the soul sound with his lyrics, to where he feels comfortable trying new styles (he even mimicks what a star hears when he talking to a groupie-regardless of what she says. Clearly the funniest part of the whole album). Kanye even taken the soul sound one step further, enlisting T-Pain, in true Roger Troutman fashion, singing a soul chorus OVER a soul sample on the \\"Good Life\\". In addition, Kanye also goes it alone for the majority of the cd, with only Lil Wayne assisting on \\"Barry Bonds\\". This is truly the complete evolution of the man named West.   The only drawbacks to the album are few, but keeps it, to me, from a 5 star rating. For one, the Principal from the previous 2 albums intro is missing, as it goes RIGHT into the music. Granted, i want to hear more music too, but DeRay could have played that intro one more time :). Also, the fact that he only got 1 other rapper on the CD is great, but Kanye has a VERY limited sense of conversation, and appears to be talking about the same things just on different tracks. As for that one assist from Lil Wayne, he did better off leaving Wayne off. I'm thinking, you making a song named Barry Bonds, why not get a true heavyweight that COMPLIMENT your style, ala 50 or Jay or Nas. I'm thankful that the skits are missing (rip Jimmy :)), but a little more subject matter and color would have been helpful. All in all though, a very great album, Rocafella 07 standard, just not Def Jam95 classic.
1580495796|5.0|Has any story been copied more times than A Christmas Carol?  It seems almost every year there is a new movie version.  And how many sitcom characters have been visited by the ghosts of Christmas?  It all starts to get a little tiring at times, but the original never does.  This story is beautiful.  No matter how many clumsy knockoffs try to capitalize on the idea and no matter how many dance numbers it inspires, the integrity of this classic will endure.  Read it again, and introduce it to your children, too.
0743482883|4.0|The murderer moves quick and the romance moves even quicker.<br />The whole idea of this Mr. Perfect is just a joke to the four friends in the book, but after lots of media coverage the Mr. Perfect list falls into the hands of the least perfect man.<br />The relationship between Jaine and her neighbors is comforting as well as great community watch. The four girls have a sweet co worker type friendship.<br />This book definately gave me chills. Tough to put down especially towards the end.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|kanye has matured on this one... every song is hot!!!!  Much better than 50's garbage.
B000QUUD60|3.0|First of all, the reason I bought this set was to  have both versions (1970 & 2001) on DVD and while I love both versions (except for the deleted songs from the special edition), my real gripe is the bonus footage and the sound on the 1970 version of TTWII---it's in MONO!! WHY?!?<br /><br />The sound on the bonus footage is HORRIBLE and the \\"bonus\\" footage sucks because it looks to be a third or fourth generation copy....an amateur could have done better editing and mixing these DVDs!!<br /><br />Either way, they'll both still get lots of playing time in my DVD player...although I'll skip the \\"extras\\".
0316067598|5.0|An unreal, yet factual, epic based on the lives of heroic men and a pivotal decision no one should ever have to face. Fantastic portrayal of superhuman valor and brotherhood.  I found myself reading for hours at a time well into the night, unable to put it down.  The emotion behind the Luttrell's story boils over the pages breaking down the hardest of resolve.  I've recommended this book to all who hold strength, honor, and love dear to them.
B000RJO578|3.0|I was waiting to see this and it left me with a bad taste. The movie does have some good in it but I was expecting more. Some of the scenes were slow paced. A standard film.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|I'll keep it short this time. I have been a fan of Iced Earth since 1991 (sticking it the person who said this was not my style of music!) and I will readily admit I was not looking forward to the release of this CD. The previous EP, Overture of the Wicked, is still terrible in my opinion. But upon hearing Framing Armageddon I was left speechless. Not only have Iced Earth redeemed themselves completely in my eyes they have given me new hope for the band's future as well. The vocals are superb, the lyrics are intriguing, and the music is beyond mere words. If you are a longstanding fan of Iced Earth or a newcomer you will find Framing Armageddon to be a masterpiece among your collection. A worthy five stars all the way! I take back everything I said about Iced Earth in my previous review, about John losing his touch and all, and will surly pay for my heresy. I am, and shall now always remain, a true fan.
B0001GH76I|2.0|My review is of the St.Clair Vision DVD.  My copy is a turkey; better yet a jackass.  Keys segments of the film are missing.  I know cause I've seen it a few times before on a bargain basement DVD version that I lost.  Based on my experience you'd be a lune to buy the St Clair version.  I trust Amazon will do the right thing so I don't have to make a Federale case of this.  The film is great, this purchase a no eyed Jack.
B000UX6THK|3.0|This really hacks me off. They just released season 2 and now they want you to pay more for the entire series boxed set.     It wouldn't be so bad if season one and the pilot were readily available, but now that first season set is hard to find.   I suppose this has to do with all the copyright issues that delayed the season two release in the first place. Arrg!!  This is also why I stopped buying all those versions of LOTR and Star Wars. These greedy producers want to take the fans for as much as they can and usually, we fall for it
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|300 is a spectacular action flick, one of the best movies to come along in a long time. I'd be the first one to admit I'll look for any excuse to watch it again and again. It is that good. My only disappointment with this pricier HD DVD is its a 2-sided disc with standard DVD on one side and HD on the other. My 2-sided discs always seem to get dings on one side or the other.
B000UX6THK|5.0|When our company released the full 27 episode series on DVD we held an all day screening in a London Cinema (digital projection) for promotion of the video's availability. This was publicized in local papers and we were amazed at the costumes the audience showed up in. The location in Leicester Square is like New York's Times Square and bizarrely dressed Log Ladies, Mounties and \\"dead\\"  Laura Palmers turned Twin Peaks into a Rocky Horror Show rival.  So strong was the impression made that the London Times covered the story and our video release was nicely served. Historically speaking, the 27 episodes released on 10 Videos was a first for the video industry.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My son (4 1/2 yr) loved the DVD.  He watched it a lot.  Worth the money and an excellent collection to be added to the library.
B00012FXAE|5.0|For the most part I have liked most Sci-Fi movies.<br />Aliens [the trilogy]not having seen the fourth, is fast becoming a classic.<br /><br />Ridley, in her bvd's must have tickled many a guy's imagination. And I sure could understand her dread of returning to the infected planet.<br />What is strange is that the idiots who press her into joining the return discount her tale of distruction.  Of course it is the Company that drives the mission into the \\"rescue\\" of the settlers.<br /><br />Until Ridley finds out that the Company still wants a live capture of an Alien.  Bishop is a much improved counterpart to Ash in the first movie, he cannot harm a human.  Lance made Bishop come alive.<br /><br />The little girl became a counter-drive of the movie - a definite reason to escape the Aliens or destroy them.  The poor Marines [elite force] were led to the slaughter.  But even they held out nicely.<br /><br />The little girl's mannerism were endearing - and what expressions.<br />I was hoping that the last remaining characters were going to come out of the escape alive.  Bummer.<br /><br />Great characters - fast action - lovely Aliens? - nasty Company men - will be watching it again in the future.<br /><br />Don't care for all the technical jargon of the movies short-comings or as a review - who cares?  the movie is for entertainment.<br /><br />DEFINITELY RECOMMEND - AGAIN not for those prone to nightmares.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Just as the Korean Version of the ring (ringu) and The Grudge were superior films to their Johnny-come-lately English counterparts, Battle Royale is superior to every single American Made film in the \\"most dangerous games\\" motiff.    Trust me, I bought them all; The most dangerous game, Bloodlust,Hard Target, the Running Man, Game of Death 1+2, Series 7, Surviving the Game and scores more including the new release of the Condemned, which is the American version of battle (in my opinion).    I am not going to give spoilers, if you have read this far you know damn well what it is about. I am going to say that it is the best subtitled film I own and a top twenty staple in my collection. The characters are lifelike, the action is more raw than any big budget, overproduced American film of the genre because of little nuances such as the fact you can't tell what is going to happen next by the musical cues. And perhaps most importantly, you will never guess who will live through this thing, by now I can usually pick a winner and this film proved me wrong and I love it for beating me at my (it's) own game, so to speak.    As most Asian movies it's suggestive as torn lace, but ultimately sexless. Yet the violence which is both premeditated as it is random and horrific make this worth owning. So enjoy this movie of hapless indivuduals thrust into an all or nothing game of survival, but as Letterman used to say...Please no wagering!
B000P0J09C|4.0|\\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is Director/Producer/Co-Writer Stanley Kubrick's meditation on the Vietnam War.<br /><br />Typical for Kubrick it has an air of detachment, surrealism, tinged with a nauseous sense of weirdness.<br /><br />In the first half of the film we have basic training at Parris island, which is portrayed in its strip-lit, hospital-like setting as a kind of mental institution where Marine recruits are brutalized. In the second half set in Vietnam, war is literally hell complete with fire and brimstone.<br /><br />The film is stunningly photographed, well-acted, and if not totally successful, is certainly memorable.<br /><br />There are no \\"extras\\" on the DVD.
1594489505|2.0|I was not that enthrolled with this book, several times I wanted to stop reading, however if I buy a book I need to finish it! I found the content disturbing, the women and their lives (their lives is an understatement) I found so demoralizing and just plain disturbing. I loved the Kite Runner and was hoping that this book would be just as good however it was not. Would not recommend this if you are bothered by women being beaten, physically taken against their will, and made to marry gross, old, bald men and have their children, I would recommend watching the new's instead.
B000000OU6|4.0|Good album, the singer reminds me of a cross between Axl Rose and Jon Bon Jovi. Slash excels again.
B000UR9TQO|3.0|I will buy this, but it's definitely *not* Led Zeppelin at their best. The 2-DVD Led Zeppelin set that came out a couple of years ago is much better, this performance from Madison Square Garden (with soundstage footage cut in to make it appear live) is really just an average performance by the band. But with that said, officially released Led Zep footage is rare, so I'll pick it up for that reason alone.
B000RG1FMO|2.0|Its aight, some of it is really lame and pop techno BS, some of it is tight, all of it is \\"not that great\\" It is a shame that he is selling so many albums while so many real hip hop artists with more talent don't sell anywhere near this; go out and buy the new Pharoahe Monch album!
B000092T6M|5.0|I love this film, always have... when I saw it was being released again I knew I had to buy it, as the first time it was released you had to flip the DVD in the middle of the film. This one not only gives you the entire film on one DVD, but also includes about 15 minutes of new footage, along with a 2nd Special Feature disc. To be honest the 'new' footage I can see why it was cut out, but the story is still one I love. Every time this is on you can't help to join in and root for Robin Hood. Stellar cast!
B00005V9IL|5.0|This is a great movie.  I'd already owned it as VHS and have been purchasing all my old favorites in DVD...and this was one I had to have.<br />Plenty of action....suspense and excitement.  It really is one you'll enjoy time and time again.
0307346609|5.0|I'm a hardcore fan of zombies and I've read tons of books of the issue, and I have to say that WORLD WAR Z is one of the best EVER books I ever read. It's creepy, scary and fresh. It's not the classic \\"survival\\" book, but an intense over-the-world history about the Zombie Outbreak. It's a must have and you really WANT this book. &iexcl;Viva M&eacute;xico!
B000KCHZK6|1.0|I have Norah's first two CDs as well as a DVD of one of her performances.  I loved her previous work.  Now she comes along with a depressing series of songs and bashes the President and the results of the last election.  Yuck - I don't need this in the music I buy to enjoy and relax to.  It will be very hard for me to buy any future CDs from Norah Jones.
B00001W9G0|5.0|Great movie, a classic even. In great shape! Came in the mail very quickly. A+
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This is a pretty impressive album. I was rooting for 50 but you simply can't deny that this album has life to it. Hip hop probably did die in the late 90s with Biggie and the last few imitators who followed. I can't help but feeling that 50s album just followed the same tired rap album formula. As for Kanye's album, it simply defies any genre. It's not really rap, not quite pop. It's just very original and fun to listen to. There are some really powerful songs on this album. I would recommend this refreshing album.
B00005JLEX|2.0|Let me be the innocent child in \\"The Emperor's New Clothes,\\" and proclaim:    Jerry Seinfeld is not funny!    Oh, I know what you're thinking: Here's  a guy who thinks Seinfeld was unfunny, but his cast was hilarious.    No. At best the rest of the cast was mildly amusing (although Jason Alexander is a talented actor, he is not necessarily hilarious, hence the two stars).    Because, when it comes down to brass tacks, \\"Seinfeld\\" *was* a \\"show about nothing\\" -- in every sense of the word:    The contrived semi-plots, with choppy one-liner segments.    The cloying, annoying, ejaculatory bass riffs between shots.    Jerry Seinfeld posing as this hipster: Yeah, right, a hipster with a ridiculous bushy mullet.  At best, Seinfeld was an Upper West Side Jewish version of Jeff Foxworthy.  You want to know why people think Jewish men are smug, metrosexual wimpish know-it-alls?  I submit Jerry Seinfeld as \\"Exhibit A.\\"  If a WASP played a Jew such as Seinfeld, he'd be accused of bigoted racial slurs against the Jewish people. Grating, like fingernails down a chalkboard.    Oh, and speaking of freakish hair-do's:  Is there anyone alive who thinks that Michael Richards as Kramer would even inspire a single chuckle if shorn of that ridiculous Brillo-pad hair?  Within three episodes, he'd have been out of the door, after having been reduced to haranguing black hecklers in the studio audience:  He's a [n-word]! He's a [n-word]!    Pathetic.    And, \\"Elaine\\"?      Puleeze! She makes Gwyneth Paltrow look like Kate Winslet, she is so flat.    Yawn.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|I have been listening Madonna since her first album. I love her songs mostly from the groove era, where she returns with her newest album. The songs are great, very funky and they just takes you straight to the dance floor. However, the sound quality is just TERRIBLE! The bass and treble are so over boosted that all I can hear is just deep bass, high treble hizzz... and nothing much more. There is almost no middle range so Madonna vocals and 2/3 of all instruments are just gone! Unless you turn it on with very high volume and turn to minimum bass and treble there is not much to be heard. Before I purchased this album I got the hung up song on iTunes and I was very disappointed from its quality. Knowing that iTunes songs are by definition recorded with low bitrate, I decided to buy the album to obtain better quality. How much I was surprised when I found that actually album sound as much terrible as iTunes version. I have over 2000 CD collection beginning from the late 80's and they still sound great. All previous Madonna albums sounds also fantastic, but this one is just terrible in case of sound quality. Too bad, because the songs itself are just great and worth every penny. But not with this edition. Whoever did the mastering was either deaf or did it intentionally. Either way we are talking here about very poor job quality. I also wonder how come so many other reviewers did not notice this flaw. I guess for pocket MP3 player is sound great but not for decent room speakers and mid range stereo equipment. I only wish they could remaster the album so I could enjoy Madonna's groove ...again.
0375842209|5.0|What can I say about this book that the other reviewers have not said? I was lucky enough to get a signed copy as a gift. Markus is an amazing author.<br /><br />This is a brilliant book that is bound to become a classic. After I finished it, I contacted all my reading buddies and recommended this book. It is a beautiful story that makes you think about our humanity and the definition of courage. This is truly an inspirational story that should be read by young and old. Set in Nazi Germany, the reader travels with death as it tells about the horrors it sees during this sad time in our history. During its journey, death comes across a little girl various times throughout her life as she deals with the deaths in her life. The lessons learned are unforgettable.
B000UX6THK|4.0|I knew it was coming.  I should have held off buying the second season, but the suspense was killing me so I purchased it when it came out this past April.  I hope Paramount is providing plenty of extras to justify this deluxe edition other than a gold wrapping, as the pilot was included in the Special Edition Season One box set.  If they had gotten their act together the first time and released it all in one box set, we wouldn't have had to go trough this ordeal.<br /><br />It has been over six years since Season One was released on DVD by Republic Pictures, without the crucial pilot episode, which so galled Twin Peaks fans. The next year an attractive special edition was released in the UK, as well as other countries, that included the pilot as well as additional material. The box set has the ghostly image of Laura Palmer underneath her portrait.  This is the edition I have.  Then came another long wait before the Second Season was finally released early this year in a rather bland format by Paramount, with little in the way of extra features other than log lady intros.<br /><br />During this time there have been various bootleg DVD sets as well as more polished releases of the complete series.  Apparently the sticking point had been regaining the rights to the pilot, which Lynch had sold to Warner Home Video.  Finally, American audiences will be able to view the complete set of episodes, including the pilot, in this Gold Box Edition.  If Parmount, Universal and other studios want to avoid piracy they should get their act together and treat television series in their entirety, not release them piecemeal, with long waits in between seasons.  It really made no sense at all in the case of Twin Peaks, which only ran for two seasons, a total of 29 episodes plus the two-hour pilot episode.<br /><br />The Gold Box Edition is long overdue, but of course it comes with a hefty price tag.  One can only hope that it is more polished than was the release of Season Two, finally bringing to rest the long running controversy surrounding the DVD release of this great television series.long running controversy surrounding the DVD release of this great television series.
B0000024RB|5.0|Andy Williams can take a song and make it all his own using his very special vocal skills. Andy leads his adoring audiences wherever he wants them to go because he passionately delivers each song he sings with true emotion and style. This CD gives us twelve wonderful tracks of songs from famous movies sung by the great Andy Williams.<br /><br />The track set begins with \\"Love Is A Many Splendored Thing.\\" Andy's voice, strong and clear as a bell, proves itself to be a very special instrument as Andy croons this classic ballad. The musical arrangement makes good use of the strings, too. Andy then sings the rarely heard words to \\"A Summer Place\\" as only a pro ever could. The musical arrangement again makes use of the strings to bolster the melody. Andy sings \\"Maria\\" with great sensitivity; and Andy performs \\"As Time Goes By\\" with great panache and an elegant piano accompaniment.<br /><br />Andy Williams also sings \\"The Exodus Song\\" passionately; and when Andy delivers \\"Moon River\\" with all his heart and soul you know you are listening to a master. \\"The Second Time Around\\" sports another great arrangement for piano as Andy croons this ever so sweetly. Andy also sways gently as he performs \\"Tender Is The Night\\" without a superfluous note--great!<br /><br />Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. \\"Three Coins In The Fountain\\" provides a strong ending for this album; Andy sings of the universal human desire to be loved by another. Andy's rendition of \\"Three Coins In The Fountain\\" will surely leave you wanting more!<br /><br />As another reviewer correctly notes there are no liner notes for this album. The artwork impresses me, however.<br /><br />Andy Williams remains a titan of twentieth century entertainment; and he still goes strong today. His singing and his countless television shows entertained millions; and I highly recommend this CD for fans of Andy Williams. People who like show tunes will also appreciate this album.<br /><br />Enjoy!
1591841666|4.0|This is a very quick read.  One has to be able to be honest with oneself at the end.  If you can do that then this book can help you greatly in making a decision for the next step.
B000NTHT6G|5.0|Stranger than Fiction was really good. I ended up having to buy it for 14.99$ because you can't rent it on here but ah well it was good so I don't care even though I am jobless I enjoyed my purchase. I have wanted to see this for awhile because Will Farrell is in it and I had the idea it was a comedy from the reviews and it was at times but just really really good and the ending is good too:):):):) I liked the premise of it, one I've never heard and it took me until Emma was in that interview in the Professors office to really be sure that she was a real person....I was confused, very confused about her \\"reality\\" Was she a real person???? I had no clue.....very good....I don't want to give it away.....anything because I'm not sure how people approach reviews....read them before or after so I will leave that be....but buy it......its worth it......
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Excellent storyline. Sadly, the political corruption is believeable. The characters were well portrayed and the story reminds us that sooner or later even if it's just one person, some one has to stand up and corruption has to be brought to light and justice served.
0307387178|4.0|Because... \\"The accumulated clutter of day-to-day existence--the lapses of conscience, the unpaid bills, the bungled opportunities, the dust under the couch, the inescapable prison of your genes--all of it is temporarily forgotten, crowded from your thoughts by an overpowering clarity of purpose and the by the seriousness of the task at hand.    \\"At such moments something resembling happiness actually stirs in your chest...\\"     The movie is one of the best adaptations of a book I've seen in a long time. I appreciate that the screenwriter didn't add a stupid non-existant love interest.     Krakauer inveigles his readers to perambulate the trails and thoughts of doomed Chris McCandless, a sort of eremitic. He also challenges his readers to take on words like analysand, contumacious, desideratum, lumpen, opprobrium, and sobriquet.     INTO THE WILD is a seriously satisfying hike.     Note: Check out the interior book design by Deborah Kerner. Great work.
0767020308|5.0|This adaptation was excellent, the cast were well chosen and were able to portray their characters with excellence, maintaining the essence of each as Jane Austin wrote them. The storyline kept to the book, revealing the attitudes of the times and portaying Emma's growth from self consumed adolecent to compassionate young adult.
B000QXDED6|5.0|Stirring epic which brings to gut-level view the heroic resistance  of 300 Spartans against the Persian hordes, led by colorful Xerxes  himself. The comraderie, discipline, fighting skills, etc. exhibited  are truly wonderful; so too is the background story: the festival  days preventing the sending of the entire Spartan army; the pain  of Leonidas' wife as she acknowledges her soon-to-be widowhood.  The special effects too are extraordinary and must be seen to  be believed. I could go on. Just watch the movie!!
0743496728|5.0|We've all seen them. Those sad children that are left out, shunned or targeted by others. We've also seen those who feel entitled by looks, money, or parents - those who for no other reason than the ability to get away with it - harass, taunt, bully, those whom they deem 'not one of us'.  As a high school teacher, I've had to deal with students who do make life hell for others \\"just for fun\\". There's not much a teacher or school can do if the bully doesn't physically touch a student and even then, bullies will go after their victim when no one is looking to \\"get back\\" at them for bringing the bullying to our attention.          Parents of bullies deny the behavior of their child or make light of it as \\"he's just playing around\\" - or the kid \\"is too sensitive\\". They have no idea how damaging this behavior is to the victim. They also have no idea how enabling this behavior will ultimately come back to them.  Basically, a child bullies because they can - they get away with it. And this doesn't start in HS, but at an early age.        'Nineteen Minutes' is thought provoking - a page turner that will make your heart break for the victims. Every HS teacher and every parent should read this book. Fortunately, this is fiction, but in our society with the over emphasis on violence, disrespect, and \\"me\\" at any cost   it's a wonder this doesn't happen more often. I know I think about it every at school.
B000002LCX|3.0|Recorded just before the Smiths broke up, Strangeways Here We Come is a bittersweet conclusion to one of the best catalogues of the 80s. While not nearly as good as previous efforts (it particularly pales in comparison to the masterful The Queen Is Dead), this album does feature some of the group's finest moments. \\"A Rush and a Push and the Land is Ours\\" is a beauty, a wonderfully melancholy pop number driven by Johnny Marr's rumbling pianos and Morrissey's wry, nuanced lyrics and sarcastically melancholy vocals. \\"I Won't Share You\\" is a stark, emotive ballad with some truly bitter lyrics and a dreamy guitar line. \\"Death of a Disco Dancer\\" is sheer apocalyptic paranoia, and \\"Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One\\" is a classic Smiths tour-de-force, awash in two-faced lyrics and damaged pop melodies.<br /><br />Sadly, not everything is on par with those songs. I could do without much of the album's second half: \\"Unhappy Birthday\\" and \\"Death At One's Elbow\\" verge on self-parody, while \\"Paint A Vulgar Picture\\" drags on for far too long (interesting lyrics, though). Strangely enough, I'm not even a big fan of this album's singles. Of the three, \\"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me\\" is probably the best of the bunch, thanks to it genuinely beautiful melody and the sheer desperation in Morrissey's voice, but it's a bit too melodramatic to qualify as a Smiths classic. \\"I Started Something I Couldn't Finish\\" sounds great the first few times you hear it, but after that it's little more than a generic new-wave punk song, and \\"Girlfriend In A Coma\\" is little more than a practical joke with a cutesy melody and lyrics that aren't even funny the first time.<br /><br />Still, it's a worthy purchase for any fan of the Smiths (but then again, so is everything else they've put out).
0446691437|3.0|Nothing completely mindblowing or enlightening really, but definitely energizing and motivating for anyone in a lull, particularly creative folk.  It's like a cup of coffee or popping a speed pill - gets you pumped for sure, but of short-lived effect.
044024157X|2.0|After I have read this book, I had the feeling to be in Southern, with its hot and humidity, but I had preferred a different story to spend my holidays. The title is not what you expect, because there is a trial, yes, and a jury, yes, but is a small part of the book. While you are reading The Last Juror, you are learning how was the life in Claton (Miss) and how a 21 years old, can run a paper with a loan from his grandma.  The book is as reading obituaries, nice ones, but no more.
B000002OVJ|4.0|It had been years since I owned this on vinyl and, as it was on sale, I took a chance.  Figured the worst that might come of it is I give it to my old bandmate, Ken, in FL.  Well, he's gonnahaftawait....  Having this recording took me back to the night they released Tommy and I was watching the band at the Fillmore East.  Here's the Who in their prime and loving every minute of their performance.  I don't think that I can say that again until their 9/11 Memorial show.  Definitely a \\"keeper\\"
B000O5AYCA|2.0|I listened to it once. I will never listen to it again. But that doesn't mean it's a bad album. Not at all. In fact I was able to sit through it without falling asleep. The production was fair and the singer reminded me of Matt Johnson from The The, albeit with a lower pitch. So, to sum up, there isn't a song I can recall but none that I hated either. I give it two stars for not making me yawn.
B000002AP1|5.0|Like the title says. This blows the original thin-edged Bowie version and the slightly superior BOMP remixing out of the water. Like the latter, the bass and drums are brought out more, but without the overused reverb. Multiple guitars can be heard (I listened to it with headphones, blasting out the daily earwax accumulation!). The only notable differences (besides the superior sound) seems to be the vocal track of \\"Gimme Danger\\". This doesn't hurt it at all, though. The liner notes (or interview with the Iggster)are very informative, explaining why the original version sounded so inferior, and that NO ONE WAS AT FAULT. If you want something that will kill your neighbors' lawn, trees, and probably the neighbors themselves, then BUY THIS ALBUM!
B000JLTRIG|5.0|great show ending was one i enjoyed ... hated the show is over ...blessed be
B00005JM8V|5.0|Extremely moving and deeply disturbing personal testimony of various Holocaust survivors and perpetrators - this video is a must for anyone seriously studying the apparatus of the Final Solution.  Concentration camp inmates who were witness or trustys of the gas chambers and crematoria describe the daily operations of mass-murder in vivid detail.  Producer/director Lanzmann is subtly vindictive in his interviews of former SS guards and officials, who are frequently evasive in discussing their involvement and culpability - this stereotypical behavior has become almost a parody to anyone familiar with cinematic representations of Germans/Nazis of that era, and it is interesting to see the root of these long-standing stereotypes in living color.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Everybody got a Dexter in themselves. This show is rather morbid but it's funny as hell.
B000TXG3YA|5.0|Why are you reading this?  Why haven't you bought this album yet?  Right now you could be listening to the best release of 2007.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|why can't Hollywood make epic's like this anymore? great movie. no computer generated b.s. watch some of the old movies if you want a plot.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I just watched this on a brand new 22\\" widescreen HiDef monitor from Samsung  and it looked absolutely AMAZING. I saw the movie in the theatre on opening night and the picture was clearer on my screen at home.    The effects, though artsy are incredible!    The acting is solid, they manage to put enough comedy into the film to keep it light, and though this doesn't add any points to the film, this is best watched without thinking about anything. There are plenty of areas (well, most of the movie really) where you have to forget your history and not even consider realism. It's based on a graphic novel, which is so loosely based on history that it should be said, \\"suggested by real events\\" or \\"inspired by historic events\\".    But it's a fun movie, start to finish and absolutely entertaining.
B000N6TX1S|4.0|this film was great. it was deep, and had a lot to say. really makes you think, about the world and the population in general. petty things that don't matter compared to a fear of us being no more on this earth. another point made is that mother nature is above all science, and man here. very well written, the whole story was very interesting, and shows what one man with nothing to live for, would do for mankind. clive owen gives a brilliant performance. this put his name on the map, defenitly. well acted, nailed his character right on the mark. from an ordinary man to a hero in a day. julianne moore and michael caine played meaningful roles, both gave a huge sacrifice for the miracle of the world. this movie is very entertaining, shows how the world because of us has gone to hell, all hope is lost, when out of nowhere we get a second chance. brilliant idea, loved it.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|Up until about 2 years ago - I had never even heard of David Lynch.  A co-worker told me about Eraserhead and after watching that movie, I was hooked.  No matter what Lynch movie I watch, I know I am in for a twisted, brain warped, multi dementional adventure.  The special features on this DVD are just as odd as the movie itself.  Can't wait to see what he comes up w/next!
B0001FR3IG|4.0|gothika is a good flick. excellent in so many ways. first off great job casting halle berry, she did a great job she really did her thing. she was composed and educated, but then she was insane with rage, then fearful, then possessed. she did it all, and it was very nice. this is why the woman is well known all over the world. the story is great, of course all of these movies are going to be in some way or the other, like a few others, but that's how it is in this industry. they give and take, but as long as they keep changing it up and adding things here and there, the old or the borrowed can always get better. the whole idea centered around this murdered girl, taking over halle's body and in a fit of rage commits a horrible crime. who's to blame. there are many twists and turns, and you don't know what's going to go down, until the last minute. the ending is a good one, and this movie does creep you out at times. it had many surprises, but it was well acted, and kept me very interested.
0312323867|4.0|On the same day I bought \\"Something Borrowed\\" and \\"Something Blue\\". After quickly devouring Griffin's first novel, I was more then eager to start her next. And luckily, I was not disappointed.    It's a great read that stays true to the character you grow to hate in her first book. But unlike what I expected, Griffin does not lead you to pity Darcy but only gives you an inside glimpse at to the thinking behind her crazy antics in both the first and beginning of the second books.     The only complaint I have about the book is that at a certian point everything the novel leads up to happens much to quickly. From the break-up with her ideal man, to the birth of her babies, to making up with her former best friend Rachel, and getting her other long time friend to admit his feelings. The sexual tension that should have been the book's fore running theme was much too down played.     But overall, the book was great and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the chick lit genre.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|man this movie is a breathtaking love story. it's for sure to be a classic. greatly written, and portrayed. the acting was excellent. i'm sure everyone was touched at one point or another with the story behind this film. it has war, hard times, and a love so deep it surpasses everything and anything. this is greatness. jude law, not much of a big fan, but the man did it for me in this one. no complaints. he was very good. believable, a prince charming. he fought with one thing in mind, his beautiful ada. he must do all that he can to get back to her, it's his will to love, that helps him live. and nicole kidman, love her, great actress. she really brought it here. a women in love, writing, hoping, and dreaming for her inman to return to her. hope is never lost, and her love is never gone. she goes from a woman of high society, to a woman who must do all she can to survive the long winter months. extrodinary performance, and the capacity to keep hope alive through all is great. as for renee zellweger, she was so good in this movie. i loved it. she's a loud mouth, off her rocker tomboy. a thumbs up for her collaboration in this film. she brought the sass, and the \\"i don't take no bull from nobody\\" attitude. just right for this film. this has it all. action, drama, love, and survival. when finally they do reunite, there is so much love and passion, you can't help but be happy for them both, finally they become one. although it was sad what happened to inman, it was sadder to see all he and she went through to be together, for the outcome to be this way, but i'm sure they would have preferred that one night together, than a lifetime without each other. and with their daughter it's proof that love conquers all.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|if it wasn't for the record industry being sneaky, i would have give this album more stars.<br />The cd itself is awesome! my favorite song off of it has to be DOA.<br /><br />It was very disappointing that the cd had a malicious copy right protection software on it. In fact, I believe it was ruled illegal for the record industry to put this software on any more cds after this big mess. A couple states filed lawsuits.<br /><br />This cd is great to put into your stereo and play. But keep it away from your computer because it will crash your computer to no repair.<br /><br />Why the Foo Fighters let them do this to their supposive \\"epic\\" (at the time) 2 disc cd is beyond me.
6304806434|5.0|this movie is just one hell of a good time. from beginning to end. it has lots of action, suspense, and you just don't know what to expect with so many criminally insane people on board one plane. just what you'd imagine would happen, there's a leader, the followers, and a pleaser. a little bit of everything you got the smart ones, the tough ones, the weak ones, the crazy ones, and a couple of good ones. a bunch of bad seeds aboard and take over the plane to try to escape. up to one guy to be the hero. in comes nicolas cage a good old southern boy, just at the wrong place at the wrong time, his hearts in the right place, but it's him against a bunch. very strong, and determined in this film i thought he was excellent. the good guy, the loving husband, and caring father. great actor, and as always did it just right. john cusack another of my favorites. is a bit funny and nics helper on the ground. they form a friendly bond through all this drama, and the evil villian john malkovich, is a great one for sure. smart, crazy, and mean. a deadly combination. overall the movie is great, definitely recommend.
B000B8QF14|4.0|Everything about this show/cd/dvd is perfect except for one small (but very annoying detail).  Like the reviewer below me stated, after every song on the dvd an interview is given...not that the interviews are bad, it just gets really annoying and completely ruins the concert as a whole.  why, Why, WHY didn't they make it an option to watch the entire show as a whole!? =(    Oh well, other than that, this really is a great release.  Great interviews with the band and it really is amazing how good this band is live.  Like seriously, it's crazy. If you crank up your stereo to the max and shut your eyes you really feel like your at a green day show, complete with all the crowd \\"hey hey heys\\" and \\"hhhheeeeeeeee ooooohhhss\\".    Bottom line:  poor editing but the amazing performances more than make up for it.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins can be abrasive when expressing his thoughts about religion, and if you can get past that and give his arguments some thought it will make you well the wiser for it. For devout believers this book should be a required reading. Consider it for testing your faith if nothing else.
0736063684|5.0|This book breaks down exercises by muscle groups and includes possible injuries caused to some muscles.  This is a great book and exactly what I was looking for to tune a workout.  I bought this and the Encyclopedia of Muscle and Strength and both are great.  Worth the money and I highly recommend these books if you'd like to fine tune your workout.
0143038583|5.0|This is a must-read.  I felt that it taught me as much as a couple of university courses.  The first hundred pages went into the complexities of the corn industry.  They were fascinating.  I love this book, and I have no scientific background.
0780622650|3.0|Keeping the same plot and dialog, and done in comic book form, Lost In Space would probably have been very good.  Creatively, it had a lot on its side.  Its vision of what future clothes and hardware will be like (besides the hyperdrive and the seemingly indestructable Jupiter 2) actually seems plausible and insightful.  The time travel storyline may not be entirely consistent, but sets up some intruiging causality violation what-ifs, and the set design and lighting are interesting and occasionally evocative, if a bit too gloomy.  The direction is efficient and fun and worthy of imitation and the score is worth buying.  In other words, it had potential.    But then you hear the script spoken aloud and somehow it suddenly hits you how implausable large chunks of the story are and how badly the screenwriter's dialog translates to the screen.  Also hindering the whole affair is the near ubiquitous bad acting.  The only actors who truly do their jobs well are Gary Oldman and the two children.  The film's computer generated space effects are imaginative but the technology of the time simply wasn't as good as model work, which is distracting.  Meanwhile, the story plays havoc with physics, which is distracting to people who know anything above average about science, though this reviewer is willing to be forgiving with regards to that, simply because one gets the sense that the screenwriter at least thought he was doing the science justice.    Lost In Space isn't a bad movie and its not quite a good movie.  So get some nachos, take it for what it is, and enjoy.
B000VZUWZW|5.0|it had me laughing.  the show has potential - I just wish the girl was a little more interesting.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|I don't listen to much hip hop, so take my review with a grain or two of salt. This is one of the better offerings I have heard in a while. Kanye is a homie of mine. I grew up on the South Side of Chi Town. He brings good beats and lyricism to the plate with this C.D. I bought it after hearing some of the preview on the VMA awards show. It's worth the price of admission.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|Unlike many reviewers I would like to own the extended versions of the films. What I find unacceptable is the exclusion of the fake trailers that ran between them in the original release. So now if these single releases don't sell well the trailers will likely never be released. If sale are high I can GUARANTEE November 08 will see a four or five disk super edition that includes the theatrical version and the extended versions along with all new special features. The studio is probably already working on it. So ether way I will not be buying this incomplete version of a great film.
B000QQFKYE|4.0|This film certainly won't please everyone.  That said, I found it absolutely mesmerizing, from the first blurry, subtitled exchange to the whacked out dance party during the credits.  I think INLAND EMPIRE is a display of David Lynch's creativity given completely free rein, and the result is a devastating portrait of fame and image, intimacy and isolation.  Admittedly, it is also very abstract and its logic is twisted to the point of contradiction at times.  Seeing it in the theater, I saw an amusingly high percentage of the audience get up and leave in apparent disgust over the course of the three-hour running time.<br /><br />Beware the nay-sayers (and the fanboys, too), and judge this one for yourself.  Even if you don't dig the overall presentation, the scene-by-scene writing is fantastic and entertaining, and Laura Dern's performance is worth three hours of your time on its own.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|This is it! In 1986 the Village Voice, a trendy NYC mag, and no lover of death metal stated, \\"if you're going to buy one death metal album, this is the only one you need.\\" They were right.    This album is a brutal combination of faster than light guitar playing, doom-laden effects, and some of the scariest lyrics ever put on paper. This is one of the best metal albums of all time. It is on par with Metallica's '80s releases. The first track, \\"Angel of Death,\\" describes the Nazi attrocities during the holocaust, specifically those actions of Dr. Josef Mengele, the most notorious Nazi \\"doctor.\\" The album takes off from there.     Although I've enjoyed most of Slayer's output, this is one of those situations when their best album came out early in their career. Grab this CD and for a real treat go see them perform live. That will end up being one of the more dangerous experiences of your life.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I have purchased this DVD and its great!  Very nice picture.  Unfortunatly I don't have a HD TV.  The sound, commentary is a little bit poor.

1572815612|5.0|I have around 65 decks and among all the complete RWS clones out there, this is my favourite. I was always put off by the orginal colouring and thick lines, ugly!    When I came across this and delicate, exquisite and sumptious re-colouring by Hanson-Roberts I was very delighted! I love her way of drawing and use of colour(among my other favourites are her signature deck and the Whimsical) technique. The details just pop out and sing their message. It's astounding how simple colour changes and line restructuring can totally change your experience with a deck you formerly couldn't work with.    So many books use the RWS for study and illustration, and it's been a treasure having this gorgeous deck to take out and follow along. As an alternative to the basic or original versions, this comes the most highly recommended by me!
B00005JPGO|5.0|I saw this movie when it was released in December 06 and was blown away. Dicaprio was spectacular with his South African accent and Djimon Honsou should have gone to the Academy Awards. When I saw it I expected that it would be just another action film but it far exceded my expectation. My only complaint is that the dvd has not enough making of features. Instead it is over crowded with a documentary about diamonds. Still a great movie. I know good and this film is good!
0880790121|5.0|I have had it 2 months and am quite blown away by it. Sacred Rose is not strictly RWS or Thoth based .....it's in its own category completely imo. The images are so forceful and full of cosmic vibration. Very intense and darkly mysterious. I have been doing daily draws with SRT and I keep getting these very profound \\"revelations\\". This deck seems to have an ancient personality, whispering secrets from the primal deep Night. The book the author wrote is one of the best companion books for deck I have read. Very unusual, in-depth and with a poetic turn to her words and interpertations. This deck is a classic, around since 1982, and you can clearly see the artist's deep and lifelong involvement with the Tarot shine through in her original and inspired images, colours and symbols.    The intense and captivating colours in this deck deserve special mention. Each suit has it's own set of colour swirls and they are completely stunning. Swords are all kinds of blues, purples, dark mauve, violet.....very menacholy. The Wands are a exquisite palette of oranges and reds. Pentacles are so evocative of the Earth, Autumn and harvest....citrines, golds, russets, yelllows and on and on. The majors are extremely powerful, you get a sense of partaking of wisdom from the Cosmos. Lots of nature infuses and makes this pack feel alive with much personality.    As far as these controversial \\"blank eyes\\" that get so much mention. I love them! They are evocative of the Otherworld/Underworld energy that this deck is so strongly infused with. I am starting to feel this deck really does transport you into the Otherworld deeper and deeper the longer you focus and work on it. You can travel to all levels with this deck.    It is a very Autumnal Tarot....the ambience and strong pull is so entwined with my love for Fall. It's a Tarot that doesn't hide the darker aspects of life, it embraces them, and turns them into something hauntingly beautiful. The backs are like a mandala and stand out as an image that can import some deep insights if meditated upon.    I have around 300 decks.....this is always the deck I return too, I feel it is my signature deck, the one that feels like home, I connect with it on a very profound soul level. I recommend it for someone looking for immense power in their readings and for exceptional self-growth and development of their intuitivr/psychic powers.
1592402038|3.0|Seriously, when was the last time you read a book where you could literally say, \\"This book has changed my life.\\" Eat, Shoots and Leaves by Lynn Truss is one such book.<br /><br />At first I thought a zero tolerance approach to punctuation sounded a bit extreme. That is until Truss mentioned one of my favorite movies (\\"Two Weeks Notice\\"), pointing out that the title should be \\"Two Weeks' Notice\\". I was shocked. I had always assumed an apostrophe was there. Then I started listening to The Plain White T's, a band whose name makes no sense with an apostrophe, and I knew things were getting serious.<br /><br />Nonetheless I will admit that it was a challenge reading the chapters about the apostrophe and the comma (although I have learned a few knew tricks for commas).  Then I came to a chapter entitled \\"Airs and Graces.\\" From there onward, the book was a revelation.<br /><br />I learned my punctuation from my mom and copious reading. I still have a hard time explaining dependent clauses and why it is appropriate to use \\"well\\" instead of \\"good\\" even though I can tell when a sentence is complete/written correctly if I can read it. I am sharing this background so that when I say Truss explains all of the punctuation rules presented in her book you will know I mean really clear.<br /><br />Truss has illustrated that there is a time and place for the dash and double-dash in all good literature. She has also shown that, to avoid over-using the dash, a colon can easily replace a dash in certain situations. I never knew that!<br /><br />What's nice about Eats, Shoots and Leaves is that it's not a dry read. Yes, Truss is talking about punctuation. Yes, she is deadly serious about it. But she maintains a sense of humor throughout: including witty examples and poking fun at punctuation (and punctuation sticklers) as much as she explains it. In addition, Truss includes  abundant historical information about the punctuation marks she discusses ranging from the first names for parentheses to the first appearance of an apostrophe in printed documents.<br /><br />I would recommend this book highly to anyone with an interest in writing. Even if you know the basics, Truss has a few tricks up her sleeve that are sure to give your writing a little extra flair.printed documents.

B000PFU7OO|2.0|I loved the music in the movie and expected to love the soundtrack, too. But for some reason, I don't enjoy listening to these songs on their own. It seems that I need to SEE these songs being sung. Without the video component, the intensity of the singing doesn't work for me. Instead of being moved by it, I'm made to feel uncomfortable. In its defense, I should mention that I may be older than the target age group. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and the music in that context.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I LOVED this movie!!  I love the dancing, the actors, the clothes, everything was great about it!
B000P0J024|5.0|I highly recommend this music to the Boomer Generation. If you like Dylan, Petty, Orbison, and Harrison, and/or Jeff Lynne, then you'll probably love this album of light-hearted, fun music. The dvd gives interesting background that adds to the listening enjoyment.
B00003OSSL|2.0|You can tell that Harrison Ford is alive because his lips occasionally move. His face looks like it is carved in stone throughout the movie, no smiles, no sorrow, no happiness, just a death mask. His wife, and a congresswoman's husband die together in a plane crash. It turns out that they were having an affair. The bereft husband (Ford) and wife (Thomas) sort of fall in love. You sit through this movie constantly wondering why anyone would fall for the wooden Harrison Ford. Don't get me wrong, I like Harrison Ford, but in this flick his affectless performance makes John Wayne seem like Jerry Lewis.<br /><br />So there you have it, a totally uninteresting romance. This is one movie where you do not see the newly in love couple romping through a flowery meadow. In fact it would be more likely to have Scott take Ford to a mortuary and have him embalmed.<br /><br />Realizing that the audience will probably doze off from time to time, the director periodically livens things up by having Ford, a police officer, punch somebody out or threaten to kill someone. So that's it, a policeman with total face paralysis takes up with a Republican (in case that matters to you) Congresswoman and they do things together. What things? Well you know, sit on a park bench and eat sandwiches, fondle each other in a car, ransack the apartment where their ex spouses would have their trysts. Finally, the movie doesn't end; it just dies.<br /><br />Oh, I might add that if you go to the Rotten Tomatoes web site you'll find that only 13% of the top critics found Random Hearts to be an interesting movie. I tend to agree with Todd McCarthy of Variety when he says, \\"Laborious, remote and strangely uninvolving.\\"
B000SW4DLM|1.0|It is very unclear from the description that this is the so called director's cut, which is much different than the original theatrical release.  In fact, no where does it explicitly say that's what it is.    Please make this more clear!  People should know what they are getting here.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I have to say up front that the picture used in the Speedway collection is not the current 2007 Invicta models. By looking at the photograph, the watch apears to have a bezel with a recessed portion at the outside of the 2-4 clock portion of the watch. The two models I've purchase have a smooth bezel all the way around and look just like the ones do in the 2007 Invicta sales catalogue. This must be an older model and the photo has not been updated. Not a big deal, but I like seeing exactly what I purchase. It could make some buyers feel they have been misled.   Invicta's watches rarely disapoint. The Speedway collection is nothing short of a stunning looking watch. It actually glitters on your arm.   That said, there are a couple of drawbacks to the chronograph. It's accurate to one-second. There are fifth-of-a-second hash marks along the watch, but the chronograph hand only stops on the seconds. I've got two of these watches, the 9211 and the 9554, both are great looking but aren't super accurate chronographs. It's a Japanese movement 21-jewel automatic, and that's a great, quality movement, but maybe the Swiss movements are more precise. I don't know, but you can't expect to get a $5,000 watch for just $120, plus shipping.  There are issues with the crown on the Invicta. The crown serves multiple purposes. It winds the watch up if it is stopped, and is used to change the time and date. But it is delicate and easy to strip out. It's hard to tell if the crown has been moved into the first or second position and if you use too much force, like I did on my 9554, you'll find that you will be having the watch repaired.   All in all, this is another great looking watch and decent timepiece that has a functional chronometer.   Well worth the price. I imagine it would make a nice gift to somebody also.
B0000646UN|5.0|Everyone else has pretty much discussed the storyline -- I'll just be brief and say that this film is incredibly well-done. It's conveyed (in Finnish) with ENGLISH SUBTITLES but they're easy to read and a good translation -- nothing goofy. \\"The Winter War\\" is one of those films that leaves Hollywood so far behind that it's really pathetic. These war scenes and action look REAL and there's no focus on aggrandizing particular actors like one has to endure with Hollywood flicks. The cinematography is second to none, beautiful scenery. If I had to pick a single war film that reflected the actual horrors of war, this would be it. It's a fine movie that you won't want to miss.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|There a lot of Disney films based off of fairy tales; Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin, and The Little Mermaid to name a few.  While, Cinderella and Snow White remain favorites to this day, Beauty and the Beast is probably the only one that is consistently funny, has good songs, and a great cast of characters.<br /><br />  If one has not seen \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", the basic story goes: Belle is a bookish woman who doesn't fit in, but as her name suggest, her beauty is unparalleled.  Her father is an eccentric inventor and is trying to become a famous inventor.  When he stumbles across the Beast's castle, he is on the way to an inventor's contest, and then he is imprisoned by the Beats who is incapable of love.  This is a very touching film because the Beast is a man who has never learned to love, and Belle has a hard time loving someone who would imprison her or her father, but eventually as time goes by, she begins to see that he is not as bad as he seemed.  It gives wonderful message that you cannot always judge someone based upon their looks, and sometimes you just need to really know a person before you can decide whether or not they are worth knowing - despite first impressions.<br /><br />  Admittedly I had not watched \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" since it came out, until recently, and I had forgotten that it is more than a children's film.  The story is very predictable, but is filled with so much fabulous music, characters with actual depth, and beautiful animation it overshadows the story.  This movie has the perennial heroine that all the other Fairy Tale Disney movies have.  Yet, this is the only Disney movie that gets the female lead right.  She's smart, sassy (not bratty), beautiful, and can take care of herself.  She doesn't desire the best looking man which is why Gaston holds no interest for her.  She is the kind of woman that I would feel comfortable letting my kids watch in a movie.<br /><br />  The only caution I would give, is that there is mild sexual innuendo most of it is from \\"Lumiere\\" (A character reminiscent of Honore Lachaille in 'Gigi') the candlestick. :)  However, it is mild, and not blatant or bad enough to deter you from letting your children watch it.  It is after all based in France, you have to expect a little bit of that.<br /><br />  Overall, this is one of Disney's crowning achievements, and should be in any one's movie collection!<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amyre is mild sexual innuendo most of it is from \\"Lumiere\\" (A character reminiscent of Honore Lachaille in 'Gigi') the candlestick. :)  However, it is mild, and not blatant or bad enough to deter you from letting your children watch it.

B000QQH4YS|4.0|This version of Robocop on DVD for region 4 (Australia) is titled Robocop: Definitive Edition. So, if you do not have this version, there is not much point to reading this review.<br /><br />I wont review the movie, I have already done that for another DVD release version.<br /><br />What I do wan't to point out is that if you do have the previous Special Edition (region 4 release) then don't bother with this release of Robocop, as it only has about 3 or 4 things on it in the bonus features that where not included in the original release here.<br /><br />This edition is great for those in region 1 (USA/Canada) because the bonus features where not included in the original Robocop DVD release, where as here in Australia we had the special edition that was filled with extras and the directors cut on the SAME SINGLE DISC!!!!<br /><br />This version they have sliced the DVD in half and put it onto 2 discs, with one disc having the original theatrical movie, and the second showing the extended cut. So, if you have the original special edition that had both versions of the movie on the one disc, and are not obsessed enough with the film to want 5 minutes of bonus features you might not have seen before, then don't think you are missing out on anything, the special edition is the better of the two.<br /><br />It is cheaper for MGM to make two discs then use a slightly more expensive disc and pack it all onto the one disc. So don't think a two disc edition sounds better and has more features, cause it does not have very much else on it at all. They are just a few interviews with the actors who played villains in the film and they talk about a few things that might interest you if you really want to know... other wise, like i said, keep the Special Edition.

B00005JPVL|3.0|I May Never Eat Another Carrot In My Life.<br /><br />\\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is like watching a live action graphic novel. A fun movie, it is very violent and filled with some memorable lines. Nice turns by Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti almost make the completely excruciating performance by Monica Bellucci forgivable. The film doesn't have the visual style of other graphic novel adaptations, but it is fun nonetheless.<br /><br />A tall, unshaven man wearing a black leather overcoat (Clive Owen) sits on a bus bench eating a carrot. He watches a pregnant woman run by, clutching her stomach. Then, a car filled with gun toting men barrels around the corner. \\"Mr. Smith\\" realizes the woman is in trouble and hurries to her aid. He rushes the woman into an abandoned warehouse and tries to comfort the new mother as she gives birth. Complicating matters are the numerous men with guns who don't care about the impending birth and want to kill the woman. Mr. Smith has to aid the new mother as he tries to protect her. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), the leader of the bad guys, is a little puzzled; he doesn't know who Smith is, or why he gets involved. The woman dies shortly after giving birth and Smith realizes he now has to care for the baby. But Hertz and his men are in pursuit, so Smith looks for help. He turns to a hooker named Donna (Monica Bellucci) who has recently given birth. Smith has to protect the baby and Donna and figure out why Hertz is so intent on getting the child.<br /><br />I mentioned earlier that watching \\"Shoot\\" is like watching a live-action graphic novel. This is a growing trend, basing films on graphic novels, allowing filmmakers to delve into unusual, strange stories, stories that would never see the light of day in a more conventional filmmaker's universe. This growing subgenre of film has brought us a number of highly visual, very interesting films. Films like \\"Sin City\\" and \\"300\\" shot the characters against green screen, adding backgrounds later, giving the films an even greater graphic novel style. And these films are pretty magnificent. Graphic novels have also greatly influenced other films. \\"Batman Begins\\" was based on the work of Frank Miller, who also created \\"Sin City\\" and \\"300\\", giving the superhero a darker edge and making him more interesting. \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" has some of these similar elements, but the environment is not nearly as interesting. The film is set in a run down metropolis, a common setting for this type of story, but it looks like a set someone went through and added some elements to, to amp up the `weird' factor. The visual style is no where near as interesting or complete as \\"Sin City\\".<br /><br />Interestingly, Clive Owen appears in both playing a similar character. In \\"Shoot `Em Up\\", `Smith\\" is not as well defined as Dwight, his character in \\"Sin City\\", or as interesting, but he is fun to watch. Taking on elements of Clint Eastwood's famous cowboy persona, The Man with No Name, Owen's character simply becomes known as \\"Smith\\". Throughout, we learn little bits about him and Kurtz even gives us a few facts he either learned or gleamed from his dealings with the reluctant hero.<br /><br />From the first moment we see him, sitting on a bus stop bench, at night, in the middle of a run down metropolis; we know Smith is probably not going to win any citizenship awards. I instantly got the feeling he was living off the grid, supported by a visit to his home later in the film. Smith lives in an abandoned warehouse complete with his own indoor garden, filled with carrots ripe for the plucking, and eating. \\"Good for the eyesight\\" he states, when Donna looks at him strangely.<br /><br />Smith is also a reluctant hero. He watches the pregnant woman run down the street and then the car full of gun toting men. He sighs, gets up and gets involved. After she dies, he initially wants to leave the baby, but decides he can't. This reluctance adds some interest to his character. As he becomes further entwined in the story, his curiosity takes over. As Kurtz becomes more persistent, this serves to make Smith more hell bent on revenge. These moments help to make Smith a more interesting character; even though he inhabits a cartoon universe, he seems to have some real feelings and emotions.<br /><br />It is interesting to watch Paul Giamatti play a villain. It is a nice change for this actor who gained a lot of critical praise for his work in \\"Sideways\\". Kurtz is not your normal villain; he is evil and hell bent on achieving his goal, but he also appears to be a more typical man. Yes, he has a gun in his hand, but without this deadly weapon, he could just as easily be mistaken for a librarian, creating one of the more interesting villains to come along in some time.<br /><br />Kurtz also has some moments of levity; his wife constantly calls on his cell phone, apparently unaware of her husband's true occupation. At moments, he wonders out loud how Smith could be giving them so much trouble. These elements help to make Giamatti's Kurtz seem vulnerable, less scary, yet when he speaks, gritting his teeth, we understand how deadly he can be. This is a villain who is equally at home spraying bullets across a room as he is trying to problem solving, and figuring things out.<br /><br />When the film was over, my companion commented that if you took all of the dialogue in the film it would probably only fill ten pages. She is completely true. Unfortunately Monica Bellucci still has a considerable amount of dialogue in the film. Bellucci has an extremely heavy accent, making most of what she says difficult to understand. That, and the fact that she isn't a good actress, makes it difficult to watch her on any level. Sure, she's very pretty, but there are many very pretty actresses in Hollywood who can at least act a little and would have done a better job in this role. Throughout the film, she frequently says \\"Smith\\" and even this simple line seems to perplex her.<br /><br />\\"Shoot `Em Up\\" certainly delivers on the action. From the initial confrontation in the abandoned warehouse, where Smith quickly secures a gun, he is never without a pistol for long. And when he doesn't have a sidearm, he finds other items to help him ward off the villains. Smith gets into many tough scrapes and finds some ingenious ways to get out of the situation. With each confrontation,  the stakes are raised along with the danger; and the elaborate stunts Smith pulls to get out of these scrapes escalates until you think it can't possibly go any further. But it does. You keep expecting the next confrontation to be a little more normal, but they just keep getting more outlandish. Watching the action in \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is a little like riding a roller coaster, with bullets flying overhead.<br /><br />But I can't really describe any of this, because it would spoil the fun of watching it yourself.<br /><br />As good as the action is, it is also over the top and cartoony. I suspect it is intended as a parody of action violence; Smith's constant chewing on carrots leads Kurtz to spout an Elmer Fudd line drawing an obvious comparison. It's a funny moment, but I'm not sure the film works on this level. The over the top gross elements take it to a different plane.<br /><br />The story? The story is as cartoony and outlandish as the rest of the film. As we watch, it continues to become more outrageous. Who cares. I'm not going to a film called \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" looking for an Academy Award caliber performance. The story is supposed to be silly.<br /><br />\\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is not a perfect film. There are a few too many over the top gross elements as well. And every time Monica Bellucci appears on screen, I felt like ripping my ears out. But the Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti are fun and the action is over the top. I guarantee that you have never seen some of these action scenes.<br /><br />My companion commented that she felt maybe Owen was trying to prove that he would have made a good James Bond. He certainly has the chops to carry an action film.se, where Smith quickly secures a gun, he is never without a pistol for long.

080701429X|5.0|One of the most important themes of this great work is substituting society's common grouping of people (black, white, Jew, gentile, etc.) with a delineation that is truly practical. Frankl rightly says there are only two categories of people \\"the decent and the indecent.\\" That is perhaps the greatest idea postulated in generations. So now we must wrestle with the fact that there are decent and indecent black people, decent and indecent white people, and yes, even decent Germans in the midst of the holocaust.<br /><br />To arrive at that conclusion under those circumstance gives hope that we may transcend the unnecessary divisions of our time, freeing us to see past exteriors and balance the core of a person on the scales of decency. We all carry baggage and this book has lightened my load.<br /><br />While these ideas are powerful they are only a sub-theme in this work. Centrally, Frankl conveys his method of overcoming life's greatest challenges and it is very profound.
0060558121|5.0|As Time magazine said in a recent issue, Neil Gaiman has been an icon in the world of comics and fantasy for a couple of decades.  Neil himself has said he is already more famous than what he is comfortable with.  My first introduction to Neil was Anansi Boys followed up with his book Neverwhere.  I was immediately hooked.  Neil thinks adults deserve good fairy tales, and I think he's just the right person to give them to us.  Neil says he wrote American Gods in longhand (Stardust too).  This book is a clash between the old Gods (Odin, Loki, Thor, etc.) and the new Gods (the Gods of credit cards, freeway, and internet).  But America is not a good place for Gods.  Too dynamic, too wild and untamed.  Moving too quickly.  Gods struggle to survive in such conditions.  But dreams burn bright.  Neil has also said that he believes there are tricksters in America.  They hang around the edges.  Tricksters lose.  Gods and heroes win.  Sometimes.  This book is a complex mix of myth, magic, danger, and secrets told by a master storyteller.  Each chapter starts with a quotation.  Chapter 13 has one of the best rants I have ever read.  It goes on for a page and a half starting with the statement \\"I can believe things that are true, and I can believe things that aren't true and I can believe things where nobody knows if they are true or not.\\"  I guarantee you will share this rant with a few friends.  It's amazing.  And Chapter 18 (which starts with a quote that says \\"Poetry ain't what you'd call truth.  There ain't room enough in the verses\\") is my favorite chapter in the whole book.  This is a book of literary magic that will resonate long after the last page has been read.  It will only add to the Gaiman legend (sorry Neil).
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is a powerful, captivating story of how God used one ordinary man to change the course of an entire nation.  THIS is an account that you won't find in a secular textbook, as there has been a complete attempt to write God out of HIS-STORY.  But this movie is one of hundreds of thousands of true stories showing the power of God, the evil of sin (and a system like slavery), and the courage and fortitude of one man who was willing to lead his generation.  (Did you know?  The historically black college Wilberforce College was named after William Wilberforce.  Also, anyone who has read Olaudah Equiano's slave narrative will find that the two men were contemporaries; Equiano is brilliantly portrayed in this movie, too.)  In short, this movie left me sitting in tears in the theater, and I'm sure it will powerfully impact and transform me as I watch it at home yet again.  I'm only a young adult, but this is a movie that I will watch again and again; in fact, I will definitely show this to my grandchildren one day.  It's just that good!
B000P46QTA|5.0|The Lives of Others manages to tell the stories of its two main characters while showing the consequences of their decisions on those around them.  Without ruining this compelling and important story I can tell you that there are moments of true human compassion and evil to be witnessed during its 2.20 min runtime, and that this film about a divided Germany speaks more about our current situation in this country than any other to come out in 2006.  The Blu-Ray version looks very clean and has an exceptional German Language soundtrack.  The deleted scenes help flesh out the characters and the filmmakers give us some insight into what drove them to tell this story now.  This and Letters From Iwo-Jima are the two best films I have seen on the Blu-Ray format while it may not show off the player like other movies, it shows what film is capable of.
B000BYA5G4|5.0|There are already dozens of cogent reviews about this film here so I am not going to add another one.  I just wanted to say that I just saw the tail end of a clip on The Daily Show (9/14/2007) where Jon Stewart was discussing with a guest a person that the government is using to gain knowledge that actually sells leftover Russian weapons from the Cold War in the black market.  Why don't they arrest him? I didn't catch that.  Something about how he is protected from all sides and that he is a valuable resource.  I missed the name of the person and most of the discussion.  If anyone else saw it please respond with more info.  And to those of you who think that there is no value in The Daily Show, I would like to say that I'm sure it is a relevant and intriguing story that I won't be able to find on CNN or Fox.  And I am a news junkie who likes to flip through the news and get the perspectives of all the networks.
B000OY8NII|3.0|They took a unique idea and created an OK series.  I can't really say anything bad about the show except that each episode is kind of \\"same old, same old\\".  It's better than most of the shows on the \\"thing that lives in the corner\\".  bg

Can Rhonda Byrne be more of an idiot?    Wait! OMU (Oh my Universe)! Stop the presses! According to Byrne ALL the people in Khao Lak and Phi Phi, hardest hit in the 2004 Tsunmami, caused this themselves through their thoughts.  It validates Carl Jung's theory of collective unconscious.  Even the newborns had these thoughts and created their own disaster. Call Oprah!    Maybe all the morons who actually put into practice her insane, \\"spend money like you already have it, then you will get it,\\" idea are the cause of the sub-prime mortgage fiasco.

0380789035|4.0|I had only read a children's story by Gaiman before (Coraline) to my kids, it  was a little dark, but in an interestingly disturbing way really. American Gods turned out to be a real treat. A truly interesting mix of ideas. On the good side I found the main character likable and the other characters interesting enough to care about (or hate as appropriate). Especially Shadow's dead wife. On the negative side I took a star away because the story seemed to drag at times due to the author's attempt at throwing so much into the story. I did like the ending though. Overall a very good read for those who enjoy speculative fiction with a darkly humorous twist.
