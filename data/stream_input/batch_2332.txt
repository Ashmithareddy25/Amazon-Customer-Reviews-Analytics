B009KS4XRO|3.0|I enjoy this game daily but it does have it's hiccups.  The in app purchasing is sketchy so i won't be spending money in it any time soon and I don't like the lack of being able to finish a set without friending random folks on Facebook.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game.  Keeps me going.  Time flies, so if you Need to pass the time, this game is for you.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This movie is almost as good as Money Ball , Clint Eastwood plays a cranky Dad who has been a Scout for<br />years and know his Baseball and has raised his daughter with all the knowledge and Instincts to be a<br />great scout for any Baseball team..
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I liked this book because it's funny and well relatable. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes having a good laugh and reading a great book.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|Works exactly as advertised and looks classy.  I got two...one for home and one for work.  People always ask about it when they walk in.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Everytime I tried to upload I received a message the file was corrupt. I'm not sure what the problem is but I am not happy.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|It is truly an amazing story and continues to haunt you,  I'd like to learn more about the subject.  Everyone I've shown it to has the same reaction.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I thought this book has some good points, however it was a bit too vague and simple for me personally.
B00BU2TEGS|1.0|I've been a fan for 30 years now and this release is even more disappointing than their last one.  I can't believe  the band compared this release to Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion.  Sorry, but listening to those albums never put me to sleep like this one easily did.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was was ok but I like it is nice.Ever thing that you are looking up there it is and l like it
B008N1V11U|5.0|After two levels, I knew- this is Barman the way he was meant to be played. The combat is amazing. You are in control of Barman. The gliding is breathtaking. This is the best game based on the worst movie I've ever seen/played. P. S. -Don't get on me because I don't like the movie. It is a good game. The end.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I think it is a very cute for all ages it is funny and you have to use a funny voice most of the book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a game where fun was made. I don't know about u but I can play this game all day long.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Hard this app before. I have always loved it. The new things they have added have added have just made it even better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very touching drama outlining the early 1920's in England. Seems to be representative of the class system of the time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play. I play for hours and want to play more. Thinking of getting more of the card games
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Tried several games and subway surfer is by far the most fun. It is challenging, fun and keeps you coming back for more.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Brings Scotland to life. I can well relate to where Rebus is in his life and the dissapointments he experiences. I have read all of them, I think and I enjoy each. I like the Rebus TV series as well, available on Netflix.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What really struck me was Hugh's ability to create rich characters that you like and care about...and flush them with a quick death.  It is courageous and in unskilled hands, suicide.  But he is quite skilled and I enjoyed his daring and wonderful story. Hugh's writing is detailed enough to bring you in the scene but not obsessed with detail like many skilled contemporaries.<br /><br />At a time when many really bad writers are publishing books on Kindle, it is rare to get new blood that actually has something to say.  The books compiled here are not bloated serial trash that is the latest craze.  He wrote until he told the story...and then the book ends.  I hope there is more and he certainly has written a world well enough to support many different kinds of stories.  Well done, Hugh.  I have become a fan.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I can get my radio stations on my smartphone, even in the car.  My car radio is not the best on AM, but the Radio Pro is great.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This has to be one of the best stories I've ever seen.  It's very down-to-earth, real life and very easy to put yourself into the story.  Absolutely a must see for every family.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|It's so great.  I can't believe I didn't start watching earlier, but now I'm hooked.  Can't wait to see Seasons 2 and 3 and be caught up.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Great picture! Excellent! So funny! It was really a blast! Smart and nasty. Had a such great time watching it!
B007V4530A|5.0|TED conferences are a showcase set for vivid contemporary speeches/presentations - the antidote to &#34;death by PowerPoint&#34; - and the author does a good job at summarising the salient aspects that characterise the better TED speeches. It provides a good overview on each of these aspects - does not have the ambition to provide a masterclass in either public speaking or presentation writing, for which deeper, more focused works exist. But as the author points out at the end of this book, reading might be good, but you really learn by getting out there in front of your audience.
1619491303|2.0|1. If Darwinism is an adequate account of the biosphere, then human beings have no essential nature, since they evolved without design into their present forms.<br /><br />2. If (1), then various races of humans may be more evolved than other races. Darwin himself states this in The Descent of Man.<br /><br />3. If (2), there is nothing intrinsically valuable about the human race as a whole. That is, some races may prevail upon other races given their selective advantages due to their unique evolutionary path.<br /><br />4. If (3), then there is no philosophical basis for the claim that humans qua humans have objective and universal human rights.<br /><br />5. But (4) is false. Our moral intuitions and the history of Western law treat every human being, irrespective of race, as possessing intrinsic human dignity and must be treated as such. The United Nation's statement on human rights affirms this, for example, as does The United States Declaration of Independence: \\"All men are created equal.\\"<br /><br />6. Further, if (4) is true, then we have no objective basis to morally condemn the enslavement or even eradication of the \\"less favored races\\" (Darwin's term).<br /><br />7. But (4) is false, because of (5).<br /><br />8. Therefore (6) is false because of (5)<br /><br />9. Therefore, (1)--Darwinism--is false. This is by modus tollens, which in this case is a reductio ad absurdum (reduce the claim to absurdity).<br /><br />Note: modus tollens (or denying the consequent):<br /><br />a. If p, then q.<br />b. Not-q.<br />c. Therefore, not-P.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I'm a big James Bond fan.  Producers did a great job and Daniel Craig is a fabulous Bond.  I did not like the ending, but oh, well, it had to happen sometime.  I will watch this again and highly recommend it.  I certainly look forward to the next Bond film.
B000W91RUG|5.0|My daughter is a high school senior and several of her friends are huge fans of the show. She had watched a few episodes with them and enjoyed it enough that we purchased the first season to watch at home.  Now my husband and I are fans as well.  Just humorous, quirky, and fun comedy.  The characters are great and the actors are perfect for their roles.  They play off each other well and the character of Sheldon has me in stitches each time I see an episode.<br /><br />NOTE: I would advise parents that almost every episode has a large number of references to sexual issues.  Trying to get girls into bed with them is one of the main focuses for three of the main characters.  It is fine for the older teen, but I would not have been comfortable with the material when my daughter was younger.  If you have that younger teen, you should probably view a handful of exisodes first and make your own decision.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|She loved it I don't like this sysyem of using a lot of useless words to convey your feeling about an item
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I've rented the HD version because was concerned with a picture quality but instead just got a regular one. Anything else was just fine!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I'm not sure I want to read another story like this.  Very dark for me, but I couldn't stop reading.  Interesting, for sure.
B00AB0Z88S|2.0|First off NO this movie is nothing like Avatar. People that compare this movie to Avatar are smoking crack because you cannot compare these two films other than the fact that CGI was used to make it. I was led to believe that this was going to be such an amazing and intriguing film but unfortunately it almost put me to sleep. Very unrealistic and dragged on forever. The visual effects are amazing (ill give them that)  but not enough to make me go back and watch it again. Its to bad RedBox doesn't offer 3d movies because I am addicted to watching 3-D films on my 55 inch Samsung with my fiancee.  Rent, definitely don't buy!
B005YVTHT0|4.0|An awesome controller for the sim racing fan, this steering wheel gets almost all the details right. The accuracy and control is very precise and the response on screen is instant. You can adjust the sensitivity of the response which is really helpful when you start out. The buttons at first seem quite daunting and having the pedals on the back took some getting used to. However, some real thought has been put into this controller and my hands got used to the controls surprisingly quickly. Most of the controls can be remapped to work just fine with other games but LED tachometer and assist knobs cannot do so.<br /><br />Software :The game does not actually come with the controller. You have to download it from the internet and it is only compatible with windows. You get one car free and for the rest you need to purchase each car with real world money. While not too expensive, this was a real turn off for me. After all if you are buying the controller they shouldn't nickel and dime you to death in the game that comes with it! It does work with other racing games so you are not limited to the simraceway game but still . . .<br /><br />Other cons were that it did not come with a stand and it has no force feedback built in. There are mounting screws on the back so it is possible to modify and create some sort of stand but after 15 minutes of playing the thing was just too heavy for me. Perhaps a regular gaming enthusiasts with gaming muscles of steel would fare better!  All in all, a fun purchase if you have the muscles to use it or the ability to build/ adapt your own swivel stand.
B002UWH8SS|1.0|These clowns apparently think \\"darker and edgier\\" means \\"Everyone should make decisions not based on enlightened self-interest, but rather to be the biggest jerk possible and make everyone hate them\\".  The writing is atrocious.  Every decision made by every character seems so out of character that the only way to make sense of this is to treat it as a dramatic mash-up of anti-characters.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />The plot is this:  We're on a ship.  We can't control the ship.  We can't leave the ship.  Aliens cost money and we don't have a budget.  Let's just be mean to each other.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is what you need for a beginner author. You can follow it step by step. Use it a guidance tool.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|The movie by itself is one of a kind! The picture is alright and everything else had worked just fine
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The Shane/Rick dynamic was fantastic in this season and actually made me forget about the whole Zombie Apocalypse issue from time to time. This season also made Daryl a more central character which is a huge plus. If you haven't watched the show and have even the slightest interest in zombies, survival horror, or a good action drama check The Walking Dead out.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I love, love, love this CD!! I don't know how I missed Rodriguez in the '70's. His voice is phenomenal and his words are deep. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes music. I hope that now he will make some more CD's. I definitely want more from him.
0812983459|3.0|I really wanted to read this book - I saw that it was rated 4+ Stars by Amazon readers, and I really like this type of story - I thoroughly enjoyed Major Pettigrew's Last Stand (NL 4 Stars), The Postmistress (NL 4+ Stars), Olive Kitteridge (NL 4 Stars), and The Upright Piano Player (NL 4 stars) to name a few.  So I bought the hardback of The Unlikely Pilgramage of Harold Fry - I couldn't wait for the paperback.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />The book had such promise.  It started out with intrigue and interesting characters.  But it got tedious fast.  First, the fact that such an introverted, reserved person like Harold would open up and say the things he did to strangers, was very far fetched and changed him to a character I didn't need to read about.  But then when he was joined by the many other people - it became ridiculous and not even enjoyable to read. If this could be edited out, the book would be much better.<br /><br />This could have been a great book - but it was only a fair book.  So unless you need to read a book every few days, and are searching for a new book - I'd skip it.  In addition to the books I've named above, read The Widow's War (NL 4+ Stars), the Velva Jean series by Jennifer Niven, and skip Tell the Wolves I'm Home (another disappointment).
B00AL1ONN8|3.0|This cd is not as well made as his prior work. To me, it seems like there is a lot of filler and sounds generic.
B008DO44C0|5.0|If you are buying this album because you are trying to appreciate all of Led Z, then good on you.  Great cuts, rock-blues, great sounds.  Worth a listen.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. I watched the movie on my iPhone 4S and the picture quality was perfect along with the sound quality. It had to buffer three times, but the buffering I believe was caused by me moving the phone quickly. Regardless the buffering took no longer than thirty seconds before starting back exactly where it left off.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|It's tough to say anything about this season that hasn't already been said. If you haven't seen the show check it out, it's never too late to join the phenomenon that is The Walking Dead.
B00AKFG15S|2.0|This book is not up to his normal standard.I felt cheated because I finished it so quickly. Word to use is shallow?
B001R3YRG2|5.0|There's a part of you that's likely to sympathize (even if reluctantly) with anti-hero (spree-killer) William Foster, brilliantly played by a harried Michael Douglas with such sedutive understatement, that each time his virulent anger is suddenly (explosively!) unleashed by society's callous indifference to his plight, you almost believe it to be justified.  In fact -- God forgive me! -- you almost want to stand up and cheer!<br /><br />This is a movie which, now having been seen, positively MUST take up permanent residency on my endless library shelves of DVDs.<br /><br />So excuse me, won't you, while I cut my review short and rush off to order the film from Amazon.
B008B68J2G|4.0|This set of \\"Scaris\\"ian furniture and caf&eacute; cart are cute. The dolls sit on the chairs pretty easily. My 7-year-old daughter was able to put everything together herself, with just a little help getting all the twist ties off from the packaging.
B0064QNS62|2.0|While the game is cute and charging in it design, the controls are just too awkward and frustrating that I couldn't play the 6th level. I'm glad this was a free app of the day because buying this would have made me angry.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Simple design, very easy to use, what more could you want out of a basic calculator? Overall, this is a pretty solid app.
0345528581|5.0|I've been lifting for about 1 year. Yeah i seen results but not what i wanted even with good quality protein supplements. I wanted something new, and now this book, on my 5th week, I'm already looking lean and lost 14 pounds of fat. No supplements just pure dedication. I feel healthier and more confident. Even stronger than i did before. There's not a day that this book doesn't leave me sore. One of the best parts is that you don't have to search up the exercise on google to see how it is performed because pictures and descriptions are already included in this book. Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and very addicting!! I love the daily challenges ad well as the missions.  Fun for all ages ...only wish I had discovered it sooner!!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie was very helpful in understanding GMOs, pesticide use, food contamination, etc... It's frightening to see how big business has changed our food supply.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|This holds a standard DSLR easily. The padding is substantial and protects a camera well. It comes with velcroed dividers for the interior so you can adjust it to fit your camera very precisely. The zipper pocket on the outside holds extra batteries, memory cards easily. It is a little large for lugging around if you're trying to minimize what you are dragging around, but it's much better than a full blown camera bag. The handle on the top is convenient.
B009NT0I06|5.0|I got a free turntable from the dump and bought a few used records mostly just for fun for my daughter to see. She then noticed this album was available on Vinyl so I ordered it for her. She likes the album very much but more importantly we've discovered the impressive sound of vinyl and learned vinyl LP's are still available!<br /><br />Since then we have bought several LPs and even some better turntables! One thing I've noticed is that the new LPs are much higher quality than the LPs I had back in the 80's.<br /><br />If you were looking for a review of the music on this LP sorry, this is my daughters music but as I said she likes it very much.<br /><br />Long live the LP! ;)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A fun, cool little pick up game to play while waiting or just to pass the time. Very similar to Temple Run. For casual and serious gamers.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Les Miserables is simply one of the great movies of our time. A must watch and a must own for everyone.
0762777931|5.0|Kris hit every point right on he head. This is a must read. Even though the title says DIET this isn't a diet it's a lifestyle. And a easy one at that to follow.
B0076HNCTQ|1.0|I couldn't watch this the first time around, although I love convoluted stories like this. I tried again, but couldn't get past the first two episodes. Just don't know what all the hub-bub is about.
0425170349|2.0|Seems awfully slow.  I am about 1/2 through and I think the stage is still being set for the main plot.  Not like other clancy books.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|this game is great the animals are adorable I have played other zoo games like this one before and none of them were this good
0877180121|5.0|this book  is very  easy to teach even if you don't know how to play yourself. we homeschool and this works well for us.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|which is in good use as it is on laptop,<br />thx to Amazon for releasing the authorities to use app on kindle fire from<br />specific area.
B000NY17J6|5.0|Words can not describe how good she is. Linda combines musical competence with raw emotional drive. I am totally stoked.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|But still really good! They seem to have a command of the story arc through multiple seasons, which keep the show on track.
0385535147|5.0|This is good Gresham.  A page turner and a surprise ending.  It was excellent.  Pretty different from most of his books I thought.
B007SGM084|2.0|I read all 3 of the Fifty shades because I don't pay for something I am not going to read. I did not like them because of the sadistic nature that was put onto the women in this book. That kind of stuff to me is more torture than pleasure.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|A great movie.  Well, I like it.  It's always had a place in my heart.  Give it a chance and you shouldn't be disappointed.
B00B1ME3DQ|4.0|After the Strange Cousins album I was little concerned that Clutch may have been putting on the creativity brakes. Earth Rocker proved me wrong. They have actually put things back into fifth gear and have reached crucial velocity. This album effectively balances the lyrical variation that excited me so much when I first heard Clutch and the repetitive rock mantra from more recent albums. It is a solid rock record throughout, save the blues track Gone Cold, with everyone in the band delivering what one would hope for and expect. While always gritty, Fallon's voice and lyrical work seems emotive and in sync with the music which harkens a a subtle psychedelic flavor at times. These tunes will fit right in to the overall Clutch experience. Real Clutch fans should not be disappointed in the least by this latest release. Put on your helmet, affix Jesus to your dashboards and get ready for launch.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Fun even for adults.  really helps with motor skills and hand eye coordination.  When things are really quite around the house it's either because the kids are up to no good or they are playing with the perplexus.
B008VBYN80|4.0|If you like Castleville on Facebook you'll like this one. The tasks aren't as extensive but the added element of battling the bad guys RPG style is great
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video has three workouts, all very intense, that only take half an hour. I went to the gym 2-3 times per week before starting this video, and it is definitely more intense than my 1-1.5 hour workouts. I am sweating, muscles burning, and most importantly, I can see the difference!  I still only exercise 2-3 times per week, but the time I spend doing this video is having a much better impact than my gym time was.  While I found even level 1 intense when I first started, Jillian has two other women with her in the video - one doing a harder version of each exercise, and one doing an easier version, so even beginners can do this video.<br /><br />I also really like the \\"patter\\" that Jillian gives during the video. Good motivational chatter. My one complaint is that she uses the word a$$ - since I am doing this video at home, often with my kids in earshot, I wish she would have kept it totally clean. Swear words are totally unnecessary.  I later bought another Jillian video in hopes of getting more great stuff, and didn't like it nearly as much as this one.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|At times I felt very guilty reading this book and the two before it, but that obviously didn't stop me.  It's basically pornography and I'm NOT proud of the fact that I have read it<br />I would not recommend it to anybody to read!!
B002JVWR4U|5.0|Having been a fan of Joss Whedon, I watched all these when they were on the telly.  Watching them again has been a joy.  Unfortunately, the rushed end is just that - rushed.  I suppose it's better then no ending.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|Pacing<br />- The pacing was very good for the time restraints it has (800+ page book into 2 hours movie) thing flowed from scene to scene. The emotional flow is about the same as the book with pieces taken out to shorten the film<br /><br />Action<br />- There gun fight and chases though they are quick and don last as long we can chalk that up mostly to length. Though there is not as much action and many my have thought. There a still scene intermixed helping the flow of the movie.<br /><br />Cinematography<br />- Really nice looking Andrew Niccol does a fabulous Job using wide camera angles to show case the scenery Which is stunning even for a desert. He captures the emotion of character using the camera to show their face and eyes to help show you how the characters are felling.  This was very well done.<br /><br />Production<br />- I personally Love the cave scene I feel as though they did a really good job with something of this magnitude (a huge interior living cave system),<br />-The desert scene are well shot and make you feel lost as if you where in the desert with the characters<br />-The scene in Louisiana  Are very well shot used many land marks that look and feel Futuristic and metallic.<br />-This is same look is used for the look of the vehicles, tools and accessories used and it's pulled off very well<br />- Has flashes of Andrew Niccol's visual style<br />-Which lead to Costumes, they were great as souls the where a vintage style, as the cave dwellers they look and feel worn in and practical.<br /><br />Music<br />- Score throughout the film good - Scored by Antonio Pinto* He does a fabulous job using the score to help convey emotions and help the pacing of the movie flow<br />-There is also an official soundtrack that has many great artists, and it is very good and worth checking out bit and pieces of this are dispersed throughout the film.<br /><br />Emotions<br />- It was touching in a few scenes, but at times I felt it kind of sputtered and never really took off. Andrew Niccol is not an actor's director and I wish he were because (as written below) some scenes the actors could've been directed/pushed more.<br /><br />Acting<br />- Solid ... no weak links amongst the actors/actresses who had speaking parts.<br />- Saoirse was good, She thoroughly pulled off the duel roll of Melanie and Wanda, Which she separated by using different accents Melanie(southern, Wanda proper and soft) And she did very well my only Gripe was that to communicate while preventing confusion was to talk outside(no Voice over) as Wanda and talk inside (using a voice over) as Melanie, and feel it might have been better to keep some of the audiology in her head to better convey that, but that would be hard to do and would be confusing to the audience seeing as it's the same voice.<br />- Chandler Canterbury Started out rocky his first experience could have been a little better But she is a very good young actor and can show a lot of emotion.<br />- William Hurt was, in my mind, the standout. I see critics really liking his performance. He was funny when needed and he really was this character.<br />- Max and Jake were good. They both have a very good presents in the film Jake is able to steel scenes to it balances out with Saoirse<br />-Boyd and Doc were very good. Though i wish they both got more screen time and character development<br /><br />The Only issue I have is the fact that it felt kind of rushed. But I have found that the reasoning behind this is That there is no Accurate way of telling how much time is passing. this whole story Took place over several months almost a year, and yet it feels as though it was only days in the movie. There are hint to how much time was really passing, but not enough for people to full understand. I feel if this was fixed then thing would seem like they happen as quickly because the time would have realistically been longer.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie was good but, not near as good as the book.  The book had so much more information.  I am not sorry to have seen the movie but, I just wished the movie could have had more of what was in the book.  I am sure the movie would have been too long.  So, if you are thinking of seeing the movie then please read the book because the movie will be so much more meaningful.

0399160450|4.0|Tom Clancy's novels are beyond well researched and capture interest from the first page to the last page and Threat Vector is no exception. The book will be  interesting to those who truly want a picture of how scary the cyber network can be in the hands of evil people.
B005HSL626|5.0|Really fun and challenging!! I love unlocking different swords! (my favorite is the glitter sword.) Plus, who doesn't like saying fruit ninja?? :) :p
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It made me laugh and cry at the same time. The characters were perfectly imperfect, especially Charlie. Every teenager should read this book because it connects to so many problems and moments teens go through. This book is real and raw. It was an excellent book and now I want to see the movie.
B001GQSY5K|4.0|Good not great. There is  remarked difference in animation quality when compared to the latter half of season two through season five. Never the less it was entertaining and a good intro to the Clone Wars series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome and on the run better than temple run because you swipe to move lanes un like themple run were you have to tilt the screen
B00280LYIC|5.0|i chose this rating because it was very well detailed and  it was cool to read.i give it five stars
B00AJLHUYO|4.0|While not \\"great\\" as I think they could have done alot more with the story, it was definitely scary.<br /><br />I always have to give a little when it comes to rating horror flicks.  You know that it is really hard to be over the top scary and not just dumb.  While not everyone feels that way, let me give you an idea of where I am coming from......<br />I loved John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\" and \\"Halloween\\" - both 5 stars.  Even the original \\"Texas Chainsaw...\\" holds a place dear in my heart for scare factor and just plane creepy - 4.75 stars.  The first \\"The Descent\\" was awesome - 5 stars.  I also enjoyed \\"The Strangers\\" - 4 stars.  Not as much as \\"Vacancy\\", though - 4.5 stars.  Rob Zombie's \\"Halloween\\" wasn't half bad either - 4.5 stars.  \\"Paranormal Activity 4\\" was the best of that series, thus far - 4.5 stars.  \\"The Ring\\", super scary - 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Sinister may well be forgotten in less than a week, but it did serve up some good scares - 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Just trying to give horror fans an idea if we perhaps have similar thoughts on scary movies.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game! Very challenging. Time consuming. Sit there for hours trying to complete a level or two.  Recommend highly.  :)
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Bought this for one song that I heard on Pandora, but like the entire album.  Very well done with great music.
0446580848|4.0|ANother good episode in the John Corey tale - set in Yemen in about 2004.  Some terrifying bits, a lot of which are probably based on fact.  Unlike some similar writers, DeMille can write a gripping action adventure story that can appeal to a liberal like me.  A minimum of prosyletizing about certain political viewpoints and a lot of good thrills and twists.  Although sometimes I agree with the character's FBI agent wife when she responds to his incessant wise-cracking with &#34;Shut up, John.&#34;
B003L77G06|5.0|My daughter and son-in-law really liked this gift.  I watchit with them.  When you need some laughs..and don't we all...this is it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have read all of Rick's novels and love the characters and their perspective of life, their friends and the strange world that they live in. Not so different from the way real teenagers interact with adults, their friends and their own strange world they grow into.<br /><br />Great story line!<br /><br />Can't wait for the next book to come out in the fall.<br /><br />Steve K.
B005LAII8K|3.0|Looper is a 2012 sci-fi film about future forensic evidence being so highly developed that people send victims to the past to get killed by a hitman. Interesting idea, especially since each hitman is sent back as well at a certain age since the assassin company (or whatever) want to keep it on the hush-hush. So Joseph Gorden Levitt's future self is sent back to him, and after failing to kill his future self, they both have 2 contradicting objectives to complete, and yet they can't really interfere with each other since the butterfly effect and all. This is when the film was the most interesting for me, especially when they talk at a diner and they're both too stubborn to reason with each other.<br /><br />Then later it gets weird, Bruce Willis wants to kill a kid to save his future wife, ok that makes sense, but wait, the kid has super powers now? What? Sure, he wipes out all the crime bosses, but was this part really necessary? The tonal shift was too jarring for me to really get into it after that. Some kid having temper tantrums and blowing people up was cool to watch, but it detracted from the main story a lot. Why couldn't the kid just have been normal? Also I stopped taking the film seriously after I saw Bruce Willis, a man who lived his past 20 years in China with his wife, can apparently wipe out an entire organization of trained hitmen by himself. Also why does the organization that sends people back send the hitman to his younger self? Why not send it to someone else so that there's no risk of \\"failing to close the loop\\". There's a lot of that s*** in this film where it makes no sense and yet you're expected to go along with it.<br /><br />Maybe I'm disappointed because I came in with high expectations, but there's a lot of problems with the main story. There were many small touches to the film that were great, like Bruce Willis telling his younger self \\"I can't look you in the eyes, this is too weird\\", or Paul Dano's older self realizing that he just screwed himself over in a disturbing scene. Many little touches to the film were nice, but doesn't really mean much when the overall story is full of holes and tonally inconsistent. I did like the 360 degree character arc that the film had, in that both the past and future selves are justified in what they're doing, and the film shifts between who you sympathize more for. Overall though they could've cut some stuff out and contained the story a little more instead of having young Professor X jar up the 3rd act.wed himself over in a disturbing scene.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I have always loved Solitaire! This is easy to use and fun. I have not had any problems with this game. Works all the time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have played lots of solitaire games over the years.  This is one of the most fun. When it realizes you've already won, before the cards are stacked on the aces, the game automatically offers to end it for you.  Then it does a funny design with all the cards!  Makes it fun!!!
B002DNDMTI|5.0|Great movie ...Blue Ray  what else is there to say ...get it and enjoy jack nickelson is funny as ....well you know
B001Q2ZHZE|4.0|Butterfly Effect is one of those movies that critics hated but normal people liked, and in a way both parties are correct. There can be some corny moments and there are some brilliant momentss, the ride is uneven, but ultimately the good outshines the bad, the Butterfly Effect is very original and engaging throughout.<br /><br />So Ashton Kutcher has something his father did where they can alter their past by going over their records or whatever, and after having an initially f***ed up childhood he goes back to try to fix it to be with the girl he loves. The results vary wildly, sometimes he'll end up with her, while someone else's life is ruined, or his life is ruined, and nothing seems to come out perfect. The four major people are Ashton, his neighbors Kayleigh, the girl, Tommy, the psychopath, and Lenny, the token fat friend. What I liked about this film was that in each scenario they were all radically different characters playing the same people, basically the same set-up for the story gets completely altered but the recipe is still the same.<br /><br />You could say that the sci-fi elements are pretty half assed in the film, but it wasn't dumb enough to pull me out of the movie, if anything it was done well enough to work in the realm of the movie. So time travel nit-pickers might hate this film, but anyone else who can get sucked into a compelling story probably won't mind.<br /><br />Maybe my favorite thing about this film though is the ending, how after numerous trial and error attempts at making things better for him and the girl, he ultimately realizes that the only way for her to truly be happy is to never be involved with his life. The very ending scene where they walk by each other as strangers, share a quick moment, then move on with their separate lives was bittersweet perfection.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I love the action and story line in this movie.Amazon has the right price for my pocket. I would recommend this movie for anyone who enjoy action pack!
0792844882|5.0|I love this movie!! shipped fast. Nothing more I can say really besides this movie was really good. Nice buy.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Really good story and great acting by all. Lots of cameos to add surprises through out the movie.  Would recommend to any age group
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie but boy does it make we wonder what the pilot was up to the night before my next flight!
B00028HBKM|5.0|A must see. Very well made but very graphic and not for everyone. Mel Gibson put together a great film depicting Christ in his last hours. Great direction, acting, props, background, etc.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game.  I just wish I knew if one or three stars is the better score.  I also love that you can progress to other levels.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|This movie is a classic and for the price; i had to have it!  The director's cut allows you to see it though the director's eyes.I love this movie because how the story line introduce you to each character and their history .  Also, the great fight of Good versus Evil. This movie open the doors for horror film with meaning.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I could watch this movie every day of the week. Makes me wish I was closer to my love one instead of being thousands of miles away. This movie would get 10 stars if I could rate it 10 stars.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Everyone's been talking about Game of Thrones so I decided to watch and the episode was free with one click and got hooked and of course you have to pay for the rest of the episodes! Great show!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Nice mouse. I'm on the toilet right now, but yeah it's a great little mouse. Really light. And cool. Really cool. Colorful.
B004X75RK4|4.0|If Sandra is in it ..It is always worth the time and money. I have never seen a bad film she has been in
B001E2JNA6|5.0|The color is so much sharper and more vivid than the DVD we had previously. It is a great improvement.
B005OK721G|5.0|This movie surprise me because of Zoe!  She really held it down in the leading role. Just seeing a strong female character pull off being a \\"hit man\\" was exciting to watch. This is not a love story but love did conquer all.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I got this for my parents who are big ice age fans and they loved this movie. They watch it every chance they get. So if they like it I love it. Yet another great buy.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|I have read Suarez' other books and this one is without exception another great piece of work. He has a unique way of presenting the scientific/mathematical/technological principles that are the foundation of how the events are unveiled.  You will not only be entertained, but you will be highly educated as well.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I am addicted to this game.  I always liked &#34;piccross&#34; games - love the color as it just adds a bright element.  The only puzzles I dislike are the random games with no real picture revealed.  I am pretty sure I am almost done the whole game which is disappointing.
B006WXHJNU|1.0|This movie is soooo awful! We bought it because our daughter loved the Hulk in Avengers and we had never seen this - but it is seriously the worst movie I think I have ever seen! They should pay people for the time they have wasted watching it!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Very funny and I love to watch it.  I would watch it over again many times.  Good chemistry between main characters.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|As  an avid Downton Abbey fan, this book really caught my interest. And it lived up to my expectations. I wanted to read it as fast as possible, but didn't want it to end. Thoroughly enjoyed this look into another era and way of life. Kate Morton truly captured the essence of the time period. Her characters were well rounded and believable. Her attention to detail was appreciated also. Would definitely recommend this book.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Great CD.  Never expected her to do a duo with Donny Osmond, but it is wonderful !!  I love this CD.
1592407889|4.0|This book was a good read. While most of it seemed believable some portions were not. I think there was a lot of poetic licence taken. It was a very sad story and if it were my mother I don't think I could ever forgive.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy this game. My daughter and I play it everyday. I hope to see more games inside ice age. Maybe, in an update? ;)  Thanks, for making this game.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|This is one of those books that should have been read in high school but never was.  Now, nearly 20 years later, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  As an angst-filled, easily distracted teen I would have found the level of detail and long, complex sentence structure tedious and exhausting.  As an adult however, reading for pleasure, Ms. Austen's use of detail and the characters' obsession with choosing their words exactly, their respect for the etiquette of the times, and  Austin's ability to paint such a crystal clear picture of each and every inhabitant of this upscale English town with impeccable phrasing is remarkable.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Very funny and I love to watch it.  I would watch it over again many times.  Good chemistry between main characters.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very interesting and keeps you on your toes. It felt like he was actually writing to me. Very good book.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game.  It is challenging.  Great to pass the time.  I just recently got it and I am hooked.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The survival mode is awesome! I love to kill zombies and skeletons and the weapons selection is really cool too.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|I have a 32&#34; 720 HD TV more than capable of displaying HD.  On Netflix its very sharp and crisp.  However the Amazon viewing experience was nothing comparable to Netflix streaming ability.  The Amazon version of The Hobbit was 480p not even a full screen display.  Very frustrating because there is nothing that can be done about this situation while viewing.  Movies great streaming product not so much.
B006RXQ0JO|5.0|If you like things that are awesome I'd suggest watching this movie.. Prepare to have your mind blown.. The Affleck brothers works so well together.. Fantastic movie..
B003TH14H4|5.0|Very funny and I love to watch it.  I would watch it over again many times.  Good chemistry between main characters.
B0091REZMW|3.0|the app is ok. could be a litter more interesting but good for being free. it has too much going on on the side.
141694737X|5.0|This book has flip pages & creates an interest for young children.  My granddaughter likes to lift the pages. Encourages curiosity & fine motor skills.
B000065V3H|5.0|The cover of this DVD was a little beat up but I did not buy it for the cover. The DVD was in great shape. I saw it already and it never skipped, stopped or had a problem. And I still remember it as a good movie from the 80's.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It obviously Isnt quite as satisfying as doing a real puzzle but it passes time.<br />It needs more categories to choose from so I am looking forward to up and coming games puzzles.
B004XWLIJS|4.0|You will not find nit-picking in this review.<br />I simply loved it!  There is no better \\"hitman\\"<br />then one who plans for most possible outcomes in<br />a \\"hit\\".  Jason's character is the mentor of his<br />friend's son.  What could possibly go wrong?<br />Worth the rental fee, I may even get the blu-ray.<br />Enjoy!<br />Greg

0811879542|5.0|This book is a cute book for encouraging imagination in younr children.  It helps them see things on a page that they can actually do.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Without closed captioning, I would have not understood a lot of the message being sung.  A lot off the Finer details were missing from the story line from the book and previous movies.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Very quit satellite acquisition with more satellite signals acquired then any other units I have. Work well with MapPoint DeLorme Street Atlas and Windows 8 Map and Weather Metro Apps
B000FC1192|1.0|Coraline was a great book , I mean I really liked it. I am also going to watch the movie. I think that the book was a little bit creepy and I don't recommend reading it to 4-6 year olds. I also think that 7-12 would really love it though. The movie is rated PG I think It is ok because my 5year-old brother is going to watch it. If you have any questions please respond  to my review. Thanks for reading! : )
B009AMANBA|1.0|I couldn't finish watching this movie. I couldn't wait for the DVD to be released. I watched it last night I have no trouble hearing but it seems that I couldn't make out what certain actors were saying half the time. I should have rented it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo will be a crowd-pleaser with your whole group.  It has enough suspense, action, interpersonal relationships, and intrigue for everyone in your family.  Ben Affleck really out-did himself with this one :)
B009X01GJ2|4.0|The Marward Case is great.  I bought the purple color because at the time the color I wanted (orange) was not available.  Now it is.  That is my only disappointment.  MTLT
B0054X3FQO|2.0|I really wanted to like this book because I basically love everything Miranda Kerr does.  Unfortunately, this book is super slim in the content department.  Mostly fluff and inspirational quotes.  It would be one thing if she put more personal experiences or anecdotes, but it's really light there too. Disappointing.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I suppose the time delay might be of some use to somebody.  Why not just include on the device in the first place.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is slow to start but once you get going look out because you will have a hard time putting it down!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I was never able to download this , so like many others the review is not good.Grandson was really wanting to play, therefore very disappointing.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|What a great movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found it easier to follow that the play. I highly recommend this show!
0312370849|3.0|This book had some very good parts. Sarah's story, the story of the Vel d'Hiv round-up, representative of countless other children taken from Paris that day, was tragic and captivating. And because it is the story of a French girl, rather than a German or Polish one, it gives us a bit of a different perspective on what was happening. In fact, Sarah's story is so good that I wish it had been the entire book. But instead, we are stuck discovering it through Julia.<br /><br />I wasn't a big fan of Julia. She was fine early on in the book, when we had Sarah's narration to break hers up. But later in the book a lot of things about her rubbed me the wrong way. I felt like her obsession with Sarah's story was very over-the-top, despite the connection to her apartment. Her neglect of her pregnancy, in particular, bothered me. I also didn't like that we only got the bad things about her husband. He is almost never displayed in a good light, when there must have been some good there for her to marry him in the first place.<br /><br />I also didn't care for the way the book finished. Not because of how Sarah's story ended -- that actually made a lot of sense -- but because of the relationship that Julia forms. It just didn't fit for me.<br /><br />Overall, this story is worth reading if you want to learn something about France during the war. But don't be surprised if Julia kills it for you.
B007WPM4P0|2.0|I was excited to watch this series and glad it was rated PG but the content is more like R for sexual scenes.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Seems to be a rip-off. No gain that I could determine. Why you even offer it is a mystery to me.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I love this CD. A lot of Good songs on this Disc and plays every time in my car. I would buy more CD's from Slash.
0142413860|5.0|This is a classic children's book.  The story is delightful.  Life has changed since it was written though.  For example, there is a phone booth in an illustration.  That takes some explaining.  Nonetheless it is a story for all generations.
B005LAII80|4.0|It was good in its own but the original was definately better in my book.  The view of the future in this on is much darker and tech is much lower the motor cycles they use are barely more than standard motor cycles.
0061733199|1.0|I just received this book a week or so ago and I actually started at the back. I read the section starting on page 556 titled \\"Nuclear Explosion\\" first. I have learned a lot about nuclear fallout and radiation protection recently and I wanted to compare what I have learned with what was in the book to get an idea as to how valuable of a resource this book would actually be. I got to page 558 before looking at a table provided and I quickly realized that the table was wrong. The table is titled \\"Shielding\\" and it shows how much thickness/depth of different materials is required to cut radiation exposure by half. The numbers in the table are listed as being in feet. The numbers are correct, but the units should be inches, not feet. As an example the table shows the radiation halving thickness for soil as being 3.3 feet, but if you look on Wikipedia, any other online source, or in the Nuclear War Survival Skills manual (a highly regarded source of info on the topic) they all list the radiation halving thickness/depth as being between 3.3 and 3.6 inches of packed soil. That is a pretty big error if you are thinking of building a safe shelter to protect your family from a future nuclear event.<br /><br />I found this error after only reading 3 pages of this book, so now I am finding myself wondering if I even want to read the rest, because there might be other errors related to subjects that I don't know enough about to notice.<br /><br />\\"EDIT on April 7, 2013. All recently edited text is contained within these quotes. I added to my review, and added some more info as to what I think about this handbook (after some further reading) as comment #3 attached to this review. I have also contacted Harper Collins (the book's publisher) and they have informed me that the mistake will be fixed in the upcoming new SAS app and I would assume also for digital copies of the manual if there are any, but that was not mentioned specifically. For anyone else with the printed copy, justchanging the table units to inches by hand is good enough to get you the correct info as well. That's all I will be doing. Hopefully the rest of the manual turns out to be just fine. \\"

B008AK8FHM|4.0|The book was well written & it kept your interest.  It was not flowery, and gave a hopeful insight into the hereafter.
B009186JYI|3.0|concert footage was great, but not as much of as I thought there would be.<br /> too much crowd footage and interviews and filler.<br />nice historical document though.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I am not normally one to read science fiction, though I love sci do movies. Ender's game is an interest in  premise written in what I felt was a very thin style.<br /><br />The feeling I had when I finished the book was that if the book had been 2 or 3 times the length, the story would have been more engaging. I just didn't feel a real connection with the  story or the characters.<br /><br />It was engaging enough, but again with more development coil  have been a 5 star read.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|It's my new favorite show on tv. I watch it on Amazon instant video through my xbox, watch Downton Abbey!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was bummed when I finished watching the last episode of House of Cards. Then a friend suggested Downton Abbey. I was surprised to find myself as taken in as I was/am. I love the time period, the story lines, and the great acting. Two thumbs up from me!

B00BL5EQLC|5.0|sorry, amazon doesn't let me use caps for some bizarre reason. this game is cool, i was glad to see it as the faotd. i thought i might buy it at some point but read that it gets pretty difficult and i don't like games that are too frustrating. so far the difficulty level is good. the graphics are really nice, and the controls actually function great, more than i can say for a lot of games. you don't have to worry about hitting the right spot, anywhere is the right spot. it's cool that even though he's running nonstop you can change directions for a do-over. as long as it doesn't get impossible, i wouldn't be sorry if i had paid for it. good music too.

B005LAIIHG|1.0|The picture quality is drab in the DvD transition. Sound quality is poor. None of the actors are actors I ever heard of or seen, heard they cut the actor who did spiderman from this film, so it would of been nice if there was at least that actor in this so I knew some of the actors, but I've never seen any of these actors in my life.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I found a surprising amount of negative reviews on Amazon, when frankly, this was THE best picture film of 2011. Why? Because it was simple but haunting and mesmerizing. You really - felt- the film, it was very atmospheric. I found myself getting absorbed into the downtown night, lights flashing by as our Driver rode down the rode, avoiding patrols in slick car maneuvers and badassary. Ryan Gosling is our main character, he's never given a name, he doesn't need one. He is merely 'Driver', and what he does defines him and the film.<br /><br />If you think this is going to be a typical action flick or thriller, you're wrong. It doens't have explosions, nor does it have the usual intense adrenaline pumping thrills - no - it's far more subtle. The beauty of the work lies in this subtlety. The director layers a story with showing, not telling, which has become increasingly rare in today's cinema scape. The plot line is not complex either, but it is far from shallow; the way the director portrays the story through the artsy cinematrogophy and well chosen sequences does more to get you absorbed and intrigued than a plot heavily obscured. And you'll also find the music itself is vital to the work, from the opening sequence where Gosling drives through the city and a well placed electro piece plays in the background, you're hooked.<br /><br />If you are seeking a film that takes you elsewhere with it's atmosphere and will haunt you for days after, this is worth a shot. If you are seeking an action film such as Fast and Furious - this is NOT for you. I'd like to say this a relatively mature film as well, the violence in this is raw and all the more gruesome for it. Don't let your kids watch it, they won't understand it, and will likely be haunted in a different sort of manner. But again, if you want to watch a unique film beautiful for its elements, please try this. It is engrossing in a way few films are.
B0015AARJI|2.0|I purchased a couple of SONY controllers from Amazon a year or so ago and they worked fine, only recently, and really because they had been dropped a few to many times by the kids have they started showing signs of wear but all in all they were fine. I bought this one for me, I wanted a new controller that I could keep, and keep away from the kids..... I did just that so there were no accidental drops but after a month the Triangle button started &#34;sticking&#34;. That coupled with the fact it came without the cord gave me a very poor taste for this order. I think if I ever need a controller again I'm better off buying a cheap 3rd party controller, at least I'll expect that to fail.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|It is good, just don't put a lot of common sense in while watching it. Just enjoy it. Its nice to see Kevin Bacon again.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Great build up and flowing read.  Cant wait to get to the next chapter to see how the story develops and not a &#34;typically predictable&#34; story line. This trilogy was fantastic.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The story is mesmerizing, the writing delicious and the reading experience was pure magic.  This was one of the best books I've read all year.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Very good product.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Good quality and easy to operate.  Good product to purchase.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love this game. I really like all G5 games. They are all worth the price to unlock. I will continue to buy games from this developer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i love this series. I love the ability to download and rent from Amazon. It is very convenient and easy.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Awesome series, and I dont normally watch horror type shows.  I liked being able to just order it and watch it immediately.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Yes, I saw the movie trailer before reading this book. I am a fan of both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, and I thought I would read the book before I saw the movie.<br />If you liked The Perks Of Being A Wall Flower ( I was not a fan. ), I think you will like this book. Unfortunately, I am a lover of well detailed/ written books, and this book failed to meet my expectations. Like Perks Of Being A Wall Flower this books is rather easy to read, and the writing style is simple.<br />I also thought the relationship between Tiffany and Pat was extremely awkward and weird.<br />In the end, I hope that the movie is better than the book.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Very disappointed that is left unfinished.  I must like it to have five books.  Where is the the book that finishes the story.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Very good product.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Good quality and easy to operate.  Good product to purchase. loads of fun
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a great game for people 8 years and older. It's very easy to play no matter what time of day
B00AYHKOZU|5.0|This album is absolutely fantastic.  I am a big fan of vinyl and was very happy ordering this and receiving not only vinyl, but a CD of the music as well.  Very fast delivery.  Very satisfied with this transaction.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Receive too many notices from people I don't know. Also the help line is useless, can't email them directly with a problem. I get nothing but a blank page when I go to a notification I want to see, but there is no help from facebook in solving the issue.
B008MM9630|5.0|So far so good.... nice graphics and easy, initiative play. Will be spending hours and hours on this with the baby. Only wish that the fairies had wings ;)
B004UG7RQ0|1.0|If you are buying a panasonic home theatre system, do not buy this product.  It will not function as intended.  However, the seller did ship the product very fast.  I gave it away to a friend that can use it, so the product does work.  I did not ask the seller for resolution, so I can not address their willingness to help resolve issues.
B00683JK9K|5.0|Very good product.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Good quality and easy to operate.  Good product to purchase.
B000FBJFSC|2.0|Incredibly painful and engrossing at the same time.  Unbelieveable childhood suffering, with an ineffectual mother and an alcoholic father. I found the Frank character compelling and sympathetic until he grew up, was cruel and callous to his mother, left Ireland and became just like his despicable father, only addicted to sex instead of alcohol.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun exciting game that keeps you on your toes with new updates and things to unlock I love this game
B0009P5YXO|5.0|For Whovians out there, I'd recommend this little toy.<br /><br />It's awesome, fun to play with and I can keep it on my desk as a pen.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|i recommended this ap for anyone with a smart phone or tablet. i downloaded this on my tablet and it keeps me up to date with the weather warnings and wind advisery.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|I was actually expecting this to be about a different topic entirely, but the writing style and story pulled me in immediately.  This is an amazing (and true) history of a heretical pagan poem which has been inspiring and corrupting thinkers for over 2000 years.  It's also a story about preserving history at all costs, and a thrilling ride along the way.  This book is also meticulously detailed and annotated where it counts, for those that care.  It's refreshing to see a combination of great writing with great research.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very good product.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Good quality and easy to operate.  Good product to purchase.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first book Fifty Shades was awesome,,,the second book Fifty Shades Darker left right off where the first one ended !!!  Talk about books you cant put down.  Please dont only buy one,,,BUY THEM ALL !!!  ALL THREE !!!  Once you start you wont stop until the last word is read and you will be wanting more.  I didnt think these books would be that good,,,but WOW was i surprised !!  It's an awesome trilogy and so much goes on,,,its heart wrenching and funny,,,serious and sensual,,,so many emotions going on and what a story line as the books go on.  I would recommend this to anyone who has an open mind.  If your a prude,,,STAY AWAY.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I have been listening to Bowie since The Man Who Sold The World.  I remember attending the very first Ziggy Stardust concert in Cleveland in 1972.  I remember blasting Aladdin Sane from an 8 track in my old Chevy.  Heroes from a tiny cassette and Outside from a CD.  Bowie has followed me through life, all the ups and downs, so I was happy to finally get another album to digest after 10 years.  And I was not disappointed.  I really do not understand less than a four star review for this album.  You can hear every album in this one, including Hunky Dory and Earthling and everything in between. But don't get me wrong, this is original music.  The two singles from this album (Where are We Now and The Stars are out Tonight) are simply great but the middle of this album (songs 7-10) rank up there with the best Bowie ever.  And finishing up with Heat will take you back to Space Oddity!  Ten stars!!!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Beautifully done, a true tribute to a classic novel. Keira was perfect as Lizzie and the rest of the cast stunning.
0767817478|5.0|any movie that my grandson likes is a big hit in my book. he loves this show. it is exciting for him
B001I45UFC|5.0|I read this book to my 3 year old. She couldn't get enough of the adventure and fun. We can't wait to start the books sequel.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it, very easy to comprehend, I didn't read everything yet but so far so good! I love it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow,,,i dont think i have ever read a trilogy as fast as i read this one.  Talk about WOW !!!  These books,,,this story was incredible.  It's not for the faint of heart for sure.  You must be open minded but the storyline cant be compared to anything else i have ever read.  I couldnt put them down until i was finished,,,done,,,all ended.  This author either has quite the imagination or lead one heck of a life.  Either way,,,i was so intriqued i just couldnt stop.  Thankfully i was able to read one after the other on my Kindle Fire and didnt even flinch at the price compared to going to the local bookshop for them.  It was worth every penny !!!  If you can handle these books you wont put them down either.  ENJOY ,,,  I DID !!!
B0025KVLUG|5.0|I like the two songs are &#34;Hey Bulldog&#34; and &#34;Yellow Submarine&#34;. They are good. I love it. It first time, I brought this for me.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|I was expecting a story about a mutually beneficial relationship with a tiger. Instead, it turned out to be totally improbable, starting out with some youngster who memorizes the value of pi to an incredible number of digits (total waste of time) with loads of fake graphics. It was also quite boring.<br /><br />One other point - this film has already been reviewed by 900 individuals, and the die long ago cast regarding overall reaction. I happened to strongly dislike the film, as did a few others. The fact that some busily patrol this site to punish those in disagreement does not reflect well on either their priorities or maturity.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|IT'S SO COOL.I LOVE CAUSE THEY UPGRADED IT THE,trains,a new girl named Kim.,the inspector is a cowboy with a different dog.NEW EVEN BETTER MYSTERY BOXES
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Love the show, the cast and the writer of the series.<br />Amazing episodes and each one full of thrill. There is no other<br />more exciting TV show than bones.<br />I can't wait to see all the episodes
B0084670FU|1.0|I actually did not enjoy this,  its dark and gritty and I would image quite true<br />but its not my idea of 'entertainment'  I actually only watched it because Brad Pitt<br />was in it -
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use.  Can change to different translations easily and compair.  I like the ability to change the font and selection of Chapters
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun and it has great graphics. I would recomend this game to my horse loving friends.
B000CCGD6Q|5.0|Long and slowly, as Mekong itself, dismantling the actions ushers viewers through intrigues, orders, sex, romanticism of characters and actions imagined by producers presenting a story of exterminating the American officer putting himself in charge for Cambodian/Vietnam pristine areas during the Vietnam war in sixties last century.<br /><br />Tragic, bloodthirsty but an attention-captive produce denigrating efforts of the US soldiers substantially and unsustainably.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Gossip Girl Has everything you could ever want in a tv show. the actors and actresses are the best. never a dull moment in this show with there was more!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Accurate portrait of the man that left a dent in the universe. As you read it it becomes clear that his unique personality built the greatest company in the world
B009LHFYNG|5.0|This book is really great. Talks about in great detail about genetics, neurobiology and is support with very good investigations.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This has become my favorite place to check the weather forcast for my local area and the places my children live
B002KS1IJC|4.0|What a well done production.  Beautifully directed and an enchanting story.  Maybe a little predictable but really worth your time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love my regular Kindle and I also love the option of being able to read from my iTouch during my &#34;waiting times&#34; when my Kindle is not along.
6302212529|5.0|One of the BEST movies ever, Everything about this movie is beautiful and heart warming. So ready for the 3D blu ray!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Just as good as the other books in the series. As always, after a really good book, I'm going to miss these characters. That's the mark of a great read. Enjoy.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Fantastic adventure, mind twisting mysterious series. Portrays allot of forgiveness, love, care, courage, bravery, high values and morale. Do watch!
B0096HL33G|3.0|I could not get interested in the story.  For some people it would be fine but not my cup of tea. I could not reccomend.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|I read the Jon Krakauer book first. I would start there.  This film is a wonderful companion after you understand Jon's insight into this kid.  Young people need help growing up all the way.  It makes me weep whenever I think of Christopher McCandless.<br /><br />Another yout that had a similiar condition but turned out better because he didn't try it alone is Eustace Conway. Read about him in in 'The Last American Man' by Elizabeth Gilbert.
B001676320|5.0|This is another Chicago concert to get  for the collection plus you get all the hits of earth wind and fire and Chicago sound is fantastic and picture is excellent
B003TTMFCK|5.0|Grey's Anatomy has been a great Tv series. I have enjoyed every season. Watching it on amazon has been great because there are no commercials.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Same as the review I wrote for winter of the world. I am now looking to find book three of the trilogy, if it exists
B00AREIAI8|4.0|downloaded this app for my daughter who is a huge fun of horses and with this she can play without the mess. easy and fun for children to play with.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love this game. Only draw backs to me is not getting/finding the gold peanuts and not enough gas to find the animals on the rescue trips. Other then those 2 things awesome game
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The whole book kept you on edge. A great read for just about anyone who enjoys a good action read!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|All the doctor who shows are excellent they keep getting better and better it hard to choose my favorite dr who I like them all.
B007HLIUN4|4.0|funny how the authors hold up the US as the beacon of light when under Reagan and particularly Bush II the establishment of extractive policies nationally and internationally was open strategy and US foreign politics always and exlusively are aimed at safeguarding their own economic interests whatever the price for unfortunate &#34;locals&#34;.....a bit biased?!? but otherwise a good read.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Not really TV streaming as I would call it. Just<br />religious programing. I don't care for this type of<br />TV viewing.
B0057XMCLA|1.0|Awful the the fullest extent of the word. I couldn't even finish it. How hard is it to make a movie from a book as detailed at eragon. You just go thru the book and that's it. I did t get thru 30 mins of it since they skipped 90% of what was in the book. Saphira didn't even look like she should have. How many mentions were made to the neck spike that almost hurt eragon. Simple things like that. Horrible movie. Would not recommend to anyone.
B00A3OJBMG|1.0|I purchased 2 episodes of Supernatural Season 8 and got charged for the entire season.  I got ripped off.  I only needed to watch the 2 episodes because I missed them and they were no longer playing on CW.com  I DO NOT recommend you purchase any instant videos unless they correct their mistake and refund my money!  Which will probably never happen!!!!!!!  Will Let you know if they make this right!!!
B008QE9XD2|3.0|I love Johnny Depp and I remember the Dark Shadows saga from years ago, but this was slightly disappointing to me. It just didn't have the &#34;Umph&#34; that I had expected, but its still OK for the kiddies to watch on a rainy day. No complaints concerning packaging and delivery.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game my son loves it too. Great game to pass the time. Love all the boards you can buy or earn. Kids will love it too. Easy to play have to have good reflexes.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Free cell is my all time favorite computer game.  Enjoying it more on kindle because it goes with me.  Thanks!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is great because it is clean, fun, and entertaining. It is based off the move Rio.<br /><br />  GET THE  GAME.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is the best game ever u get to play all day u get to pick it characters and u get friend options wen u do have a friend u get points
B001HZK8FO|2.0|The main box of the bluray is broken in one side... it is not a travel brake... I am very disappointed
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this DVD! This is one I could watch over and over. Not disappointed at all! Thumbs up on this one.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Bag arrived on time with other items that I ordered , very well packaged,  easy to set up. Have been using it for a  month I haven't had a problem
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I loved every last detail in this  book. I recommend this book to everyone who likes action romance and adventure all rolled in to one.<br /><br />M.p.h.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Very fun exactly like BLT5 for the pc.  Way better than BLT4.  Works great on my kindle fire HD.<br />  &deg;get GAME&deg;
B000OIZUW6|3.0|I have met the author in the past when he 'worked in a publishing company' and remember the poor books he wrote in the past, he has taken a good step in his works since then, with much being shown on televisions or movie. This is another solid job.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I have no complaints regarding this order. It was very enjoyable and amusing. If you have a child you are fond of, this would be a good gift for him/her.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|buggy blitz easy fun and good graphics c c c c c c cc. cc dd Cfc gt c ccccc c c v v v v vb b.  c x
B003JQLHY0|2.0|Bought my second one of these from seller Dexclusive and as with the first there is dust under the glass on the dial. I was under the impression Seiko quality was top notch! I've already returned the first now I'm contemplating whether to just live with it or ask for yet another replacement........<br /><br /> Rubber strap seems to be Ok, although it has quite the &#34;tail&#34; on smaller wrists. Other than that its a nice looking piece !
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This left wanting more so that tells you I''am looking forward to the next sseason! Sooner than later! Also the fourth season I hope discloses who Alana stays with if either brother!
B0035LJY6C|5.0|This movie has a little bit of everything. Raul Julia is so funny, and the family dynamic is actually sweet.
B0065CCM76|4.0|Have always like this genre of music. Bob Seger does it great justice. And I could not pass up this mix of songs and the price was good.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love this game. not fond of spending money to get certain things though. keeps my nine year old entertained
B004LROUW2|5.0|I love it. The story was well elaborated, very interesting and  it gets weird as it progresses that keep you reading to find out the rest or the story.  I found remarkable the way the author introduced the new world without letting the reader notice the changes when using a gateway to the new world.<br />One of the scenes that I liked was the scene when the main characters are reunited and found the way back to the world with one moon.<br />I would recommended it to a friend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book. It was so very good!!! This is my favorite Colleen Hoover book to date.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Bought the book just out of curiosity to find out what the big issue with this book is. Total waste of my time. As a flip pages I felt my IQ steadily going down. By the time I was done felt like blowing my head off. Just can not believe there is actually a 3 book series.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|The surround mix on this version of 2112 is done exactly right from my perspective. Subtle use of the rear speakers that keeps the music in proper perspective. The audio clarity is crystal clear. The comic book style artwork that follows the music was more interesting and enjoyable than I anticipated. If you are a fan of early rush, and have a good surround sound system with a Blu-ray player, this is a must have.
0064435962|5.0|This is the best Eric Carle book, in my opinion.  My grandchildren and nieces love doing the actions as we read the book.  The 2.5 year old even has it about memorized after only a few readings.  If you are considering this book - buy it!
B0045NDVFE|5.0|This CD put The Band Perry on the map.  I love all the songs and Kimberly has a great, strong voice.  A must have.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I knew that the movie was out and there has long been a play, but I wanted to read it before I saw any of it. This book played with my emotions. I cried, grew angry, and experienced joy! It is a long read with Hugo going into detail about the past of certain areas, that can be a little unnecessary. Overall, I'd recommend that it needs to be read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is perfect for Kindle Fire as well as Android and iPhone users. Very easy to start and a continuous challenge along the way. I would recommend this runner game to anybody without hesitation.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Watched the movie and loved the Trilogy e-book.  Have loaned it to a friend.  Would recommend to many - excellent story and fast reading - can't wait to finish to see how it ends.
076781326X|5.0|DVD was in great condition when arrived. Saw the show when I was a young child. Great to see it again.
B005DJREGQ|1.0|This show is awful.  I'm so offended by the content of this show.  From the fact that the main character is having blatant sex with another teen to the way the mother is so self absorbed and treats her daughter like she's a failure.  I tried to find a redeeming quality about this show, but simply could not.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|This is a great game but  when I turned off my kindle my hours and hours of progress was erased.  It set me back to the beginning.  I  now find it hard to play this game knowing all my progress will not be saved.
1451695195|5.0|I could not put this book down!  This true story of a neurosurgeon who has a near-death experience shows a man who goes from a place of buying into the &#34;scientific&#34; explanation, to a place of realizing that the scientific explanation does not explain things at all.  He had a thorough knowledge of the brain and how it works, but during his experience, his brain was literally not working--no activity--yet he went to a spiritual place that was incredibly vivid.  His miraculous recovery stunned everyone.  This book is definitely worth reading--maybe more than once!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is deffinately one of my top favorite games there's no glitches or anything.I love the gameplay basically all I'm saying is that its awesome!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I really liked the story, well written, well drawn, ....well done. A completely different take on a classic. If you like Batman stories, you'll like this one.
B000GOY3I0|5.0|It's rich! It's a good movie for Friday night with kids. When you and your family don't have any plan on weekend, than this is a good choice. I highly recommend this movie.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game, it's great fun to play. I have told all my friends about it, this is the one to have...
B000I2JI80|5.0|I've been shooting Portra 400 for a couple of years but recently made the switch to 400h because of the extra luminescence that it has. I'm not much for the pastel colors that people normally prefer with this film but after telling my lab about my preferences, the saturation was perfect! I'm sold!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is easy to learn and from kids to grownups will love playing. The scenes change from time to time (from Rome to Sydney) and the subway cop wears different costumes ( he was in a rabbit costume for Easter)!  Also very addictive !  You will love it...
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Again too confusing for this old bird!!!  I've never been very good with games so this is nothing new for me!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Has a difficult time putting this book down. Great story, lovable characters and a lot of good cliff hangers and twists. Can't wait to read more!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The prediction algorithm is really good. It also automatically learns non English words. It is simply the best keyboard app I have used.
B0052GACNM|2.0|I was just listening to the duet with Lady Gaga. No Sirree! Not for me... 1) everyone can sing \\"The Lady is a tramp\\", I mean it is one of the easiest song melodies and lines - the harmonies are very basic in Jazz 2) I think I could have done a better job. Don't know about the other duets (which is why I kept 2 stars) but this one is just a joke. Maybe I just lack the sense of imagination...
1476734941|5.0|I liked the book because the diet makes sense to me. Its very easy to follow. At the moment I am trying the diet. I have tried tons of diets thru the years, but I think this one might be the one for me. I have only been on it for 31/2 weeks and I am not sure if its working yet. But I strongly recommend it for anyone out there like me, 69 years old and still trying to lose weight, without giving up too much.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's okay.  The only reason I even look at facebook is the pictures.  It keeps me up to date on families that I don't get to see that much!!!
0307891372|4.0|the guide was well thought out.i have a couple of complaints.the first one goes with the way i play-i get the fire shouts and storm shouts before i head on up to skudofn,the problem comes later when you get books and shaladors writings. sooner or later you have to get a book from high  gate ruins,you are blocked from getting into the area where the book is,i had to quit and loadthe game one section below the high gate ruins and go from there.now when getting books i see where i'm going before leaving the library,if it says high gate ruins i turn off my machine and come back clicking continue.the computer will give a different place to go.the second annoyance is similar only your exploring caves,find and pick-up books.when you start collecting books for the library this book will come up,but,when you take it to him you can't give it to him,you just have to go back to that game start over and don't take the book.the guide doesn't tell you this. the cave is halldir's caine.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is pretty fun!  the pictures are imaginative and the pace is nice :)  I will tell my friends about this game
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This is a great addition to my lost library. It is great to watch without commercials and having to wait a week.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|This wipe holder does not keep wipes wet. The red thing also pops off extremely easily. Beyond that the holder is much bigger and bulkier than I would have thought from what looks like a sleek design. I wouldn't recommend.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is a very interesting book.  I  started reading it and could hardly put it down.  I also like that it's not drawn out with alot of filler pages that don't need to be there.
B000085RPU|2.0|Well I'm not satisfied with the order and instead ordered two because none worked as I wanted too but anyway thank you very much
B005RDF2RG|1.0|I played this for my kids so that me and my husband could spend some quiet time on the porch. That did not happen because the movie kept stopping or pausing.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This is a great addition to my lost library. It is great to watch without commercials and having to wait a week.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I put off reading this series forever. I have no idea why, the book was great and I can't wait to read the rest.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Saw this movie in theaters -- twice.  The first time, I went on opening night with a group from my literature class.  We had just finished reading \\"The Hobbit\\" and everyone had liked the book--we couldn't wait to see it visually.  It blew us away.  Definitely not the same as Lord of the Rings, but in the same world.  The humor was fantastic, the acting superb, the storytelling (as always) excellent.  I loved seeing Richard Armitage's, Martin Freeman's, and Andy Serkis' (Gollum) work -- they all did a great job, especially Freeman.  The actor really nailed Bilbo's character and manner.  He really made me see the similarities between his character and the older version played by Ian Holme.  Armitage played a very heroic Thorin--I hadn't actually liked Thorin's character until I saw it off-page and on screen.  The writers and actors were able to pull the best bits of each character and bring it to light.<br />The graphics (for me) were a little less than par, mostly because they screamed CG to me (as opposed to the LOTR's very real, very cool fellbeasts and wargs.  Why did the change the warg design?  They were already so terrifying in the Two Towers.)  But Gollum was great and the lighting in this movie was so beautiful.<br />This movie is definitely not for everyone--if you aren't really a fantasy lover or a Tolkein fan, I understand comepletely.  But if you loved the book, there is no reason not to love the movie.  It was so hiliarious and touching to hear Tolkein's words--spoken by Bilbo or Gandalf--and the dialogue in Riddles in the Dark.  Every person owned their character and their moments.<br />My favorite parts of the movie were the Contract Scene (I loved how the seemingly unrealistic part of the book was used in a humorous way), the Riddles in the Dark Scene (who can't like that?) and Thorin's charge down the burning tree (awesome!).  The dwarves' theme, the Misty Mountains, was terrific, as was the credit song \\"Song of the Lonely Mountain\\" which echoed thedwarves' pride, hope, and vengeance.<br />I can hardly wait for Hobbit 2.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie. Near the end of the movie, tears were rolling down both our cheeks. I would highly recommend this movie.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|It is all things Dylan and will please the most persnickety fan.  The changes in his voice over the years are evident, but the quality of the performance holds steady.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I heard from the parents that they as a family , just love the game.  The kids ask their parents to play it with them every night.
0590129279|4.0|I heard about this book when I was younger, but never got to read it until now. For such a short book, it packs a lot. The story touches on many topics: philosophy, religion, relationships, culture, etc. One of those quick reads that will keep you thinking about it long after.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|The game is really fun and it gets harder on the upper levels. I like to make the cars and crash them
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Love Ben Affleck and this is a movie we all need to see!  It's amazing who we have in our government that are willing to put their life's on the line...a must see!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Very fun game.  Like Diablo for android.  Once you get comfortable with the touch screen controls you won`t be able to put it down.
1594487154|3.0|I heard the author speak on an NPR interview.  I purchased the book to learn more.  The premise of the book worked, but it seemed like the author had some difficulty in translating the theory into how to implement the actions.  The book was written well and I did enjoy some of the background stories.  Overall, I thought there were some useful tips.
B007BVMVDU|4.0|Great introduction to the complex historical narrative that is Game of Thrones. Looking forward to picking up episodes on the fly as we don't subscribe to HBO.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best because I can build a fort and anything i want. I really like the sheep and all the other animals
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I love every new edition to my collection.  I have enjoyed every new series; part<br /> of my collection, great movie!
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is riveting.  Flynn's technique of employing two converging timelines builds suspense to nail biting levels.  One feels a progressive sinking feeling, picturing what lies ahead, only to be fooled and fooled again.  The complexity of her plotting is a marvel.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved these books.  It took me 3 days to finish the entire trilogy.  I was upset by the ending, but still awesome!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting and it gets pretty intense even got one of my friends addicted lol she loves it to
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is by far the most dramatic and tense book yet. I was hanging onto the back of my chair for hours at a time.
B008OOYALE|5.0|[[ASIN:B0088QGB7Y Smurfs' Village]]the game is so cool all my family love it one is 04 other is 05 & 10 they want it to be easy to get money
1401225756|5.0|I'm gonna review the physical book rather than the story. There are plenty of online resources (and the other customer reviews here) for reviewing the stories in this volume which contains issues #1-8 of the original 75 issue run. Just know that this is the first of 10 volumes in the series so expect a lot of introduction and back story in this volume as the author lays out the framework and characters for the rest of the series. With that said, this is a solid series and should not be overlooked.<br /><br />Now then, the book itself is recolored as seen in the comparison images above which really looks nice. The paper is of high quality and large enough to really enjoy the drawings. The book is put together as such that there isn't any content lost where the book comes together in the middle. The quality of this trade paperback (TPB) is an example that, in my opinion, all publishers should follow. If you're wondering whether or not you should purchase this series in TPB form or hardcover based on which will provide a better reading experience then know that the decision will rely on if you like paperback or hardcover more when reading. Although I don't own the hardcover ([[ASIN:1401210821 The Absolute Sandman, Vol. 1]]), it is larger than the TPB which will give you even larger pages but more expensive as a result. This paperback volume is of great quality with great recoloring and large enough for enjoyment of the drawings. This makes it the perfect buy for someone who wants to experience this critically acclaimed series while keeping the cost low without sacrificing the quality of the reading experience.
0061733199|5.0|I keep this in my bug out bag just in case. tons of info, some already knew about, and some stuff i didnt. always good to have this kind of info
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game!!! My kids love to take turns surfing and setting high scores and even my self love the game too...
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|movie is great on a new sony tv and brings back great memories from the past, awesome bluray worth purchasing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very good game,and is so addicting!I literally can not stop playing it! It's perfect for anyone really.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|If you're tired of the same old stories, watching this absolutely hilarious movie.  The main actors have a certain charm to them and the plot is funny as hell.  The movie is short so it's not a huge time investment and it is well worth the watch.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I paid 5 bucks for the Kindle version of The Hunger Games trilogy. I don't feel I wasted my money. I probably wouldn't have bought the books if it hadn't been for the $5 deal, plus I kinda wanted to see what the Movie left out. I am curious how they do on the next 2 movies now.<br /><br />Good read, wished there was some more description in places. At times the narrative feels rushed, and events are skipped with no explanation, but for a quick read it isn't bad.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|ok thanks for this app...I love downloading vids and if u love hair videos u would look up bebexo all videos are 5 star so cool :) good luck :)
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|awesome great quality blu-ray dvd on a great TV makes it worth the great pricing of this great movie, good buy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is the best game ever.you should try it.It is sooo FUN & AWESOME!For all you people out there if you are bored than get subway surfer!!!!!!! It will change you LIFE.
B0052FYPJK|5.0|If you want to read a great martial arts guide, begin any style of martial arts training and stay at it for about a year. Then read this book. It will really make sense.
B0000047CW|5.0|This is indeed one an essential part of one's collection. Just start playing it in pretty much any company and folks will ask (positively) &#34;what's that?&#34;. It's hard to believe how timeless this music is, and especially how marvelous the musicianship is. Stan and Charlie both shine on this, along with all the other players. Simple advice - just get it.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|what why would u get this app when u could get the free youtube downloader thank about it do use your money!!!!!
B000063V8U|5.0|Wife is a big Star Trek fan.  She loved the present :)<br /><br />It was a good thoughtful gift for her.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I don't like It much because when me and my friend played I got off to check something but when I got back on all my stuff was gone my iron my diamond sword<br />ALL of it so I'm rating it as a 2
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best part of this game is the fact that it requires hand-eye coordination and I love the way it gives choices of different characters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I love playing games like this because it really helps me focus. Only problem I have with this game is that you cannot seem to edit the sounds. I do not need the constant music and background noise while I am playing. I just cannot seem to find an options menu.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I cannot understand why this dystopian drama was over 500 pages.  Written like a soap opera, it covers a short period of time and takes forever to get to the end.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  See the movie instead!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I actually think slightly better than the first book, which I absolutely enjoyed.  More characters, character development and greater insight into Lisbeth.  Now I have to read the 3rd book right away.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. It is really fun you should definitely get it. It is similar to temple run but it is really good I love it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|My whole family and I loved this movie, the 3D effects were very good. I think it's a nice addition to our movie collection.
034580404X|4.0|I say 'surprise', because I wasn't expecting to get into this trilogy - as a journalist I just thought I ought to read what everyone else was talking about. And so I started. At first the writing style (it is slightly repetitive and sloppy) got on my nerves, but then the romance took over and I was rapidly hooked. After book one I couldn't wait to start book two. Book two was the weakest of the three, but a necessary means to get to book three, which, in my opinion, was by far and away EL James strongest book. It was as if she'd come of age as an author, especially by the end, when we get Christian's pov.........I LOVED this one. So even if you think that this might not be for you, it is the perfect holiday read (think sunlounger, cocktails, sea lapping at your feet) and you will cry when it comes to an end.....  ps Another great holiday read (it has all the key elements of 50 Shades but without the bondage i.e. great banter, humour, sex, romance, moral dilemmas is Lover in Law [...]
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Paid the dollar and it says I don't own it. Wish I had read all the bad reviews before I got it. Stick with the free version. Not worth the dollar.
0385341008|4.0|Great story about little known area affected by WWII.  Enjoyed the format of being told through letters.  In today's society of instant communication, found it fascinating to read old fashion letters and telegrams.
0399160450|5.0|Wow! A great read.  First, this book is very prescient.  This type of hacking is going on as we speak, and we know it's from China.  The book never gets into detail how bad it could really be if they succeed.  But let the imagination run.  I found the Clancy novel, and Mark Greaney's second collaboration (check out his Gray Man series--top notch--there's a rumor another one's coming out in Dec.) with Clancy is even better than Locked On.  This one had much more humanity than I've seen in some of the older novels, and not as much unnecessary detail.  The plot moves quickly and the characters have depth.  Here's to hoping the Clancy-Greaney collaboration continues!
B001KT79UO|5.0|Loved it it was so fantastic I would definitely recommend it to another person to read this book!!<br />It Was Fantastic
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic great app love the graphics on this love all the different things you can do with the horse
B003IDMUSG|5.0|John Grisham is rated at the very top of  the pile for his novels  and this is no exception. It is one of those books you would hope would never end. When it does, it is like saying good bye to a good friend
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a good movie.  Very entertaining.  Sort of a story about America, the peasants vs the house of lords
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Much better than your average crime/law TV series in that the characters have depth and have to struggle with some interesting personal and career dilemmas.  The writing is quite good.  There are episodes where facts are spoon-fed to you or details are glanced over so quickly that you have hit pause to think about how the logic of those statements even work but those are rare occurrences.  Definitely made me want keep moving on to the next episode whenever I finished watching one.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I love it a little omg like it's totally awesome I hope I can get more free books well this isn't the best but it's alright
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love the game! HOWEVER, it has a tendency to lock up and then I have to turn off my Kindle and restart it which is frustrating.
0425263908|3.0|Parts of this story seemed unbelievable. What modern woman would submit and commit to such an overbearing relationship where &#34;her man&#34; would take it whenever and wherever he desired. Isn't that RAPE?
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is soooo addictive! its great, dun buggy on the beach... smash stuff... big jumps... and run over seagulls!!! Gotta try it
B003Y58CKS|1.0|Another great classic opera ruined by an egocentric stage director. Opera is going rapidly downhill because of bizarre and tasteless productions like this one. RegieTrash garbage. Get the Pavarotti or Domingo dvd instead.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is amazing!! so addictive and so fun! it is so good and worth downloading,my favourite game! i can play on this game for hours and not even get bored.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed book #3 but I must say that #2 is the best to me. But finishing the trilogy is a must!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This product made it so easy to transfer pictures from my camera or SD card to my iPad. Great !
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy the game.  Has some glitches but fun.  I have on my kindle and my I phone.  Better on the I phone.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|The look and style of it is beautiful. Keeps my Kindle Touch safe. Fits like a glove. Definitely a step above your regular bland case. The lettering on the front is a nice touch.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Awesome adaptation of a great book series.<br />Awesome adaptation of a great book series.<br />Awesome adaptation of a great book series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great way to pass your time. It is also fun to challenge and beat your friends. I love the tour of the world.
B0050X1OQ6|3.0|My only complaint it is I don't think the box is 100% happy with it as it takes forever to reboot after it was installed (like 10 minutes) almost like it has to check it every time. Other than that it works and since I don't reboot often it isn't a big issue but it can be an issue if you think it is not going to work the first time you put it in.
B008HK3S9K|2.0|If you want quick easy access to your Kindle Fire HD this isn't the case for you. It's soft, perfect for travel, but it's not a case. Just a slip cover for your Kindle Fire HD. The material feels cheap. Taking the device out of it isn't easy and I prefer a case where I don't have to remove my Kindle in order to see it and use it. Great travel case, not a good every-day Kindle case.
1451678193|5.0|I really loved this book when I borrowed it years ago from a public library, it was a large hardcover book that I found hard to put down. The little paperback I got was easier to hold for long periods of time so it was read faster. I had forgotten most of the story details so it was almost like reading it for the first time.
B004QX07G4|2.0|Knowing how intelligent and quick witted Ms. DeGeneres usually is, I was a little disappointed in the content of this book...Light hearted, scattered,  with little insight as to what really makes Ellen tick...that would have made a better book..funnier,too.  AB
B009UX2YAC|4.0|\\"Subway Surfers \\" is a entertaining, addicting game. It's easy and fu n to play for the first few days you play it. Although after a while it gets boring quite fast and it starts to get on my nerves.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|When I got a random opponent,they started to ask me for my age and other information about me. Just saying there are some people who will say things like that I have to resign from the game. BUT, the only way to resign is to delete the app. Needs a resigning option without deleting app. Other than those issues, it's a great app.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|You have to add this to you collection if your an SOA follower. It's a fantastic series and has so many twists and turns now that keep you wanting more. Kudos to these great actors who have done so well in the portrayal of biker outlaws, they really get into their parts and if you watch much of the You Tube interviews with them, you will see that they seem to have a great bond outside of their threatrical personas.
034580404X|5.0|Great...shipped timely....good price...awesome
B0044C3RB4|5.0|One of the best shows ever. Maybe some day they will make a movie or do a part two on tv.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|i had read the book and was dying to see the movie and it was all that  exepected as as a compulsvely avid reader.  my husband love movie also does not read much,.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I am lousy at numbers but love puzzles. This game has so many options that anyone can enjoy the gametime. I am still on the very easy puzzles but my time is improving. I like the options menu that gives you choices on knowing if you made a mistake or if there are conflicts on your puzzle. I play the game to pass the time so I am not into strict rule playing. This means you can play it easy or rough. Right now I like it easy.<br />Fun, fun, fun!
0817439390|5.0|this book was very informative and helpful....every new photographer should read this book...explains what you dont' understand about exposure! thank you
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Nice twists and turns, although some of them were easy to guess. It is an easy and entertaining read.
B005FISC52|5.0|It was a birthday gift for my 16 year old granddaughter who just loved it on TV and when she got gift had all her friends over to play it over again.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This book was so fun. Loved everything about it. I enjoyed how the story started with all these people as strangers to each other and somehow ended up being linked together. I found the pace of this book very enjoyable. First it started slowly and left you wondering what or how these people would be linked. Then suddenly BAM! everything fell into place. This book left me happily mind blown.
B00594XOZU|5.0|all my friends and i use it and you dont have to have or pay for a phone service its free
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|This is a nice cover I got it for my husband.  The only thing I wish it had was the ability to turn or more standing up options.  You just have to hold it.
B00BBRPRDG|4.0|This CD is the best of the old and new from Poco.  The songs hail back to their early country/rock days but also embraces their biggest hit sounds from the late 70's plus has a fresh feel from songs like Hard Country and the title track.  The band has soldiered on over the years and fans are celebrating this new release.  You'll enjoy this music as much as anything around today.
1939416019|1.0|Though compared to some truly great fantasy in the description and despite all the glowing reviews I read, this book is, at best, a total waste of time. It reads like a really bad piece of fanfiction. Characters are 1 dimensional at best, the plot is contrived and mediocre, and the universe is a hodgepodge of meaningless cliches wrapped in a bundle of banality. I'd like to get my money back and then some for the pain and suffering of having sat and read this entire \\"book\\".
B009JBZH54|5.0|I haven't gotten a chance to watch the 3rd movie yet, but the first 2 are classics. Product arrived quickly and in advertised condition.
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|A great review of a book I read years ago.<br />Steinbeck creates powerful vision of life in the Salinas valley of times past.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Although I've come to expect sad endings in most of Nicholas Sparks' novels, I don't like them.Even though I hate that Cole was killed, the fact that his heart beat in the chest of Amanda's son was strangely comforting. It's a sad story and beautifully written. Sparks has a way with words that keeps my attention until the last page.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Pretend I have 2,433 coins I play for a little while and over time I end up with like 576 coins or something. So Annoying!  Other then that,  it's okay
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game for kids all ages. It's like temple run but easier too. You shold get the app if you don't.
B002ZE85YW|3.0|The more times I watch this movie the more disappointed I am in it.  Christian Bale's performance is downright terrible.  There were many times when he even reverts to the growling Batman voice.  I had high hopes for this movie after the travesty that was T3 but sadly T4 wasn't much of an improvement at all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read. I would recommend to anyone. Keeps you wanting to read more. I didn't want to put down. Wish I could share it on my kindle.
0345802934|5.0|Murakami's great<br />One thick book split into three<br />Eased endurance read<br /><br />oops.  I was nine words short.<br />I'm almost one third of the way through 1Q84 and love it so far.
B001EOOQEM|1.0|I LOVE this album, but after 2 tries with Amazon, both CDs purchased through them were defective. When I loaded it on my computer, both CDs I tried did not recognize 2 songs on the album, & it was the same 2 songs on both cds, so I guess they got a bad batch from the distributor. So, after these 2 tries, I decided to just get my money back & try again later.. I also tried downloading from the website, but my computer & player doesn't seem to work right with the site, so I don't have the album in any form now..sigh..
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Suzanne Collins must have been in a very dark place when she wrote the finale to The Hunger Games series.  I was so amped up for this book after Catching Fire and I was SO let down after turning the last page.  Such a let down, I don't even have the words for it.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Is an epic game you should defintily more awsomer if you want to have lots of fun get this game it is a little hard to get in the first world but you'll get it
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It works. I can do most anything on facebook that I need to do....what more can you ask for in a facebook app?
0525953728|4.0|The firsts half was kind of slow, but after the mission started, it was very riveting. Pretty much matched the movie (or the movie matched it) depicting the same events.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|I cannot believe the amazing plot points that were cut out of this movie to shorten it for theaters.  It was like watching two different movies!  The Queen's son, Orlando Bloom's wife and brother . . . what on Earth were they thinking cutting these things out?  If you haven't seen Kingdom of Heaven yet you need to watch this movie.  If you have seen Kingdom Heaven(the theatrical cut) watch this movie.  I promise you you will not be disappointed.
0440241901|4.0|This book was a little disappointing in that it was not the mystery that I was expecting to find.  Not too badd
B0032Y8XH8|1.0|I don't get it.  This cd was highly recommended and I can't stand listening to it.  I was looking for traditional irish music.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|When many people are saying, &#34;Hip Hop is dead&#34; this cd proves them wrong. Nice collaboration between two genres finest young performers. Would love for them to do a follow-up.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|It is the most amazing game there s for tablet. I have been playing this game forever<br />I hope you have a fun time with it. Its even free
0515141429|5.0|This is one of a series of good mysteries. Best read in order but not necessary.  Some early ones have been reproduced under new titles so is hard to know where they fall in order.;
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It works just as well as the version for play store. Just the Kindle HD MENU button is on the right hand side, kind of wield at the beginning.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the best sci-Fi themed reads out there.<br /><br />Couldnt put it down!  Especially for the price, just grab it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|LOVED the book, I could not put it down.  It was not the usual for King, we saw a softer side.  Beautiful love story enmeshed in this historical thriller.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book.  I love the way the author wrote the book through the eyes of a dog.  I guess I didn't realize all the feelings animals have:  the emotions, smells, and ability to convey their message.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|For an even better show watch DAMAGES with Glenn Close and Rose Byrne!<br /><br />But this is pretty good...just not as mysterious.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|The man! Yes Sir, I can watch any movie he acts in. Not just case his handsome, it's like he's made for his parts. This was one we had to out collection.  Amazon ship item new as listed. Arrived wrapped well in bubble wrap. Tracking information was email as well. Great job.
B007SGM084|5.0|Enjoyed the read.  It got misreading books again. I don't think I've had time to pickup a book since becoming a mom 29 years ago, recommend this to women from all b a backgrounds.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I use it a lot.  Stable & easy to use.  I'm a regular Amazon customer, so this makes things easier.
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|great movie just wish it did not glitch the kindle fire HD. but please watch this movie if you do not your missing out
B004T8RAPM|4.0|This book (Getting to yes) is of good quality, the material that is resistant and is very practical, recommended for business
B007VUA7VO|1.0|This item ate at my battery life and contributed to a horrible experience in charging my device.  After three days of trying to charge my Kindle HD I figured I figured it out and removed the app and voila all was back to normal.  Do not use on your Kindle HD
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game! It's much better than temple run!It's the game I play most every day.mostly everyone I know, has this game. my favorite characters are spike, and frizzy. I like their hair.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|its fun but the only problem is when I get farther into the game when ever I jump or run its blurry where ever he was before if the people who created this game read this. either fix the game or I delete this from my kendle. if you fix it than I will change my review
B007XNAOS0|2.0|I have the first two albums. I have seen them live a couple times. I really liked them up to this point. The music is still recognizably Baroness, just inexplicably derailed into sounding like The Killers first album. Huh? Indie-Metal act goes emo or something, I don't really know what they were aiming at. Suddenly started sounding like some band of 19 year old emo kids from the late 90's. Jimmy Eat World or something. Sheesh.<br /><br />I still liked the music, just hated the vocal direction.<br /><br />Guys! Savannah metal scene should run them outta town on a rail. Tarred and feathered and all that. Bummer.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Bought this mouse in order to play League of Legends (moving on from a wireless mouse) and this mouse is great! Great price, great quality, and great performance. Highly recommended :)
B0062OCNAI|3.0|Book was from a different point of view I would have not expected.  Was difficult to put down.  Quite suspenseful.
B00821OX98|5.0|I did not watch this program when it first came out because the commercials for it made it look so stupid. I was really surprised when I finally sat down and watched it. I think this series would have had a longer life, if the commercials had made it more appealing.
0385471378|5.0|This is a true Mexican language book - it is down to earth and deals with the strange customs that existed and I believe in some places still exist.
B004QX07G4|5.0|She is amazing as always! Could read over and again, wish I had the audio version just to hear it in her own voice!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's brilliant it has helped me in getting into regular study and prayer time thank u very much God bless
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I fell in love with the song Madness on the radio and checked out this album.The digital album was only $3.99 and after listening to the previews I couldn't resist. I've listened to the whole album several times already and I love it! It's great how they can sound so different from one song to the next. I think when people write their own songs, they tend to start to sound the same. Not Muse. Whatever they're secret, I hope they keep it up!
B00006F83Y|5.0|Music is good as always and it was shipped quick, packed well- no issues. QOTSA are best during this time.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Wow, finally a program that does what it is supposed to do.  That is so rare that it caught me off guard.  Great interface, and works very well.  My only suggestion is that the print size be increased.  I am getting a little too old to read the very tiny type with ease.  I still can't believe someone is not charging for this app.
B008G33NFC|5.0|Such an immaculate presentation, proves that Tarja can indeed Walk Alone and be at the top of the game at what she does. One of the best DVDs in my collection, one that will get revisited often.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this game.is really awesome...I loved the first one too but I love this one even more. it's very addicting and fun to play. and its very easy to play....I love it..
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book deserves a medal you could really imagine these events. it was a really sad book I really thought
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game made me feel 20% cooler in 10 seconds flat. BEST PARTY EVER!!! The animation is amazing and the script is hilarious.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Im constantly looking for a sharp do it all knife that will not break or chip under heavy use.  I found that with the bk2 it chops and cuts and feels great in my hand. It may not be the best choice for a particular task but it will do them all  and remain sharp. I am very tough on all my hunting and  camping gear and i am sure this knife will last a very long time. If you are looking for a good indestructible knife this is it. The only modification i made to the sheth was a teklok and  now the sheath works great.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|This book will provide you with a new level of awareness allowing domination in your social interactions.  You're pitching blind without it!!
B0026772N8|4.0|...to help people see things in a different way.  Much like Howie Weener Unclogged, this book has a helping nature, one that will make the reader hold on to the valuable lessons.  In Unclogged, laughter is used, as a matter of fact, it may be the funniest novel ever.  Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is timeless, much like [...] Howie Weener Unclogged: A colonic noir musical memoir shall be.
B00AG475K8|5.0|Another John Hughes hit. Cute story. Great cast. Good music, too! It had to be part of my DVD collection.

B00AIQP9DE|3.0|This was a bit confusing because you had to remember. a lot of different. things. But I enjoyed the stoty line
0896600009|5.0|My husband and i were very pleased with this purchase.  It was in excellent condition and exceeded our expectations.  Thanks.
1616550414|5.0|I ordered this book for my husband and he LOVES the book. He was thrilled when he opened it. The book really is cool looking.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a good book.  I read it so that I could go watch the movie, but I have yet to see it.  The book was a very quick read, and I didn't want to put it down.  I love Nicolas Sparks books, and this one just continues that trend.
B005ISZRES|5.0|I had always wanted to read this book. So happy that my girls got me a Kindle, I've easily searched and found great books to read. Many of them free!
B005HEVBGG|4.0|I remember when UPN launched. There was no local affiliate, so my mom and I watched a few of these episodes on Saturday night after the local news. The signal from that station was terrible, so we gave up after a few weeks.  It wasn't because of the quality of the program, though.<br /><br />Voyager takes the normal Star Trek premise, but tweaks it by cutting the ship off from the typical resources they have access to by kicking them to the other side of the galaxy. The overarching plot is their search to get home. There are some really nice episodes in the opening season.  I particularly liked &#34;Jetrel&#34; where an alien is faced to confront his perceptions of a genocidal event in his people's history. Another fun episode is &#34;The 37's&#34; where we find out what actually happened to Amelia Erhardt. These two span the spectrum of Star Trek writing, too. Jetrel is full of moral ambiguities and challenges us to think outside our own perspective where The 37's has a very positive and hopeful message. I plan on continuing the voyages of the Starship Voyager through the other six seasons.<br /><br />The video quality is pretty miserable. CBS hasn't done any restoration and Amazon's compression scheme hasn't done the show any benefits. The episode &#34;Learning Curve&#34; has tons of weird artifacts that make you suspect the whole episode was shot in front of a green screen, but the effect is seen in shots you know are on a full set. It looks better than it did when I watched it on the weak UHF station in the 90s, but I wouldn't even call it DVD-quality video--maybe VHS+.<br /><br />I never expect much from streamed audio, and there were no issues to report with this season's. It sounds like Star Trek. Voices are clear.<br /><br />If you have a Prime subscription, then give the show a watch. That's the basis of my 4-star rating. If you are thinking of paying for the season outright...Well, I'd suggest a Prime subscription that would give you access to all the seasons without the buyer's remorse the video quality might bring.ons without the buyer's remorse the video quality might bring.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great no  on to number two.  I wish it did not end the way it did. Next one and then last
1416594787|5.0|It arrived fast and in good condition. I have not read the book as of yet, because i have a few other books ahead of this one but just skimming a few pages everything looks good.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I own the hardcopy of two of these bookks. Now have 2 on Kindle. This is a great series for anyone of any ae to read!
0316228532|2.0|To be or not to be – disappointed.  Like Lady Di in a dress off the peg at M&S. J. K. Rowling is one of the best storytellers of our times but  with this novel she appears to have had nothing better to do than scribble about,  a disjointed tale as though she were to write about the five toed chicken from Dorking.  Too many underdeveloped characters, an obvious rehash of social decadence, a pseudo-pompousness of those who think that they “have” versus the very oversold “have-nots” --makes for a very long story which takes the reader almost nowhere.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is one of the most suspenseful books I've read in quite awhile.  Normally I'm a computer geek at night but couldn't put this one down!!!!!!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|great app, very easy to use.  allows me to enjoy music when ever i need it-right at my finger tips
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|These books always found a way to surprise me. They were excellent!!!!  Great for young adults and adults alike. Wonderful!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I have played a bunch of match 3 games and this one is by far the best. Worth every penny !! Highly recommend it :-)
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works perfectly and I don't know what random ad pop-up windows people are talking about, but I have had no problems with the app and will continue using it and enjoying it in the future.
B00AO686G0|3.0|Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is one of my favorite films of all time and has been since the movie was released 25 years ago. I had it on VHS and on DVD. When the Bluray was announced, I immediately ordered it, but when I received it in the mail, I began to be a little disappointed. The packaging is completely bare bones with no insert, pretty rare for a 25th anniversary. I popped the disc in to watch and found the menus to be pretty standard, but when the movie started, that's when the real disappointment came...<br /><br />The film has not been remastered. This is just a Bluray of what was on the DVD. It's grainy and not is true high definition. For a film like Who Framed Roger Rabbit? on its 25th anniversary, it was a real let down.<br /><br />Still, it is Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and I'd enjoy it in any format. It's a classic nostalgic trip to the golden age of Hollywood cartoons, with all your favorite Warner Bros, Disney and MGM cartoon characters. Hilarious and touching, with excellent performances by Bob Hoskins (Eddie Valiant) and Christopher Lloyd (Judge Doom), Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is great for both kids and adults, especially those who grew up with all those classic cartoons.<br /><br />But for the price, you should probably wait until they shed the DVD in the package and lower the price. Or perhaps until they come out with a remastered version. 50th anniversary anyone?
B00003CXRM|5.0|what a top movie  good actors good acting good music good singing good story good setting so what more can i say
B00B2V66VS|5.0|THIS GAME IS VERY FUN AND VERY ADDICTIVE. JUST AS  GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE AND IT'S FREE!!!  A MUST GET GAME.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a really fun game and keeps you entertained for a while. It's different from Temple Run, but very similar and I guess  it was the model for this game. Aside from that, the game is awesome.
B001AR4K8K|4.0|Forget Twilight. The original teenage vampire flick is The Lost Boys. It's fun, concise, fast moving, with a great plot and doesn't rely on overly-CGI'ed effects to make it great. Characters span the gamut from brooding to hilarious. the soundtrack is a little too cheesy 80's, with &#34;People Are Strange&#34; and &#34;Good Times&#34; as the only good tunes, but otherwise it's an awesome flick. The Bluray is excellent HD quality as well.
B007R4WENS|5.0|I'm a beginner and I was looking for a source of easy access piano chords. This is so much more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is simply amazing. Its so much fun I can't put it down. I'm always trying to beat either my last high score or my friends'. And I so do love the challenges.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is addictive get it heres a good seed for minecraft<br />Reminder spell it exactly how I spell it:).i like pizza and then Mark the place your standing with something besides dirt then take it out when your really good and get a bunch of ladders and dig straight down see what happens!?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book for kids or adults. Very interesting and hard to put down. It is interesting to compare to our society
B009EAO38C|5.0|From start to finish, this album is the reason why I love music. Fresh, powerful, creative and authentic. Great job guys!
B0002TJGQS|4.0|Fast Shipping. Item as described and expected. No complaints whatsoever. Havent used it yet as its a backup battery for my red dot scope when im in the gun range or hunting
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like this book because it is very funny. I recamend this book to somebody who likes funny books. I loved it.
B008B4KVS8|5.0|Absolutely delighted that Ice Station Zebra was transferred to Blu-Ray.  The picture and sound quality are first rate.  The plot, still fascinating after all these years, plus a stellar cast and acting, make this a superb and highly enjoyable film!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I started watching Downton Abbey as a Prime free instant video. I was hooked. I got tired of sitting at my computer and decided to order the first 2 seasons on DVD so I could enjoy anywhere. Then of course I had to catch up with season 3. Can't wait for season 4 to air. Love this story!
B00B84652O|5.0|I just received my box set and I have to say that it was beautifully done. The box set includes as you know the first King Diamond albums. The cd's are housed in mini vinyl simulated sleeves with all the original tracks, no bonus material here. The bad thing is that you don't get any lyric sheets for the albums, for the price of the set is not a bad deal, plus the cd's sound great and as I said you are getting the best King Diamond material in one set. I would recommend you buy this from a seller rather than direct from Amazon. From $50 to $17 is a big difference and even more than a bargain. All in all is think is a great set especially if you don't own any of these albums.
B005GSVFB4|4.0|If you liked the original movie in this series you should also like this one.  It is an excellent sequel and is worth a look.  Recommended!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game yet I cant put it down its a must game to play and its free don't pass this game up get it get it get it lol

B002CPMB9O|5.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"American Gangster\\" starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was an excellent movie. Very worthy. Everything about the movie was well done.<br /><br />The story is two-fold and both take place on the film at the same time. It takes a while to get used to it, but, ultimately, you'll understand and appreciate it. One story has to do with Washington who become a leader of a Black family who controls the NYC drug scene. The second story has to do with Crowe, who is a somewhat discredited NYC Police detective who is put in charge of an investigation of the NYC drug scene. The movie alternates back and forth between the two independent stories but as the movie proceeds, the stories intertwine in a stirring climax. It's an interesting filming technique and well done.<br /><br />The acting is good, the characters and setting are believable, the filming is good, the stories flow along appropriately. If I had any complaint, and it is minor, it would be that the background sound is a little too loud for the conversations. It's a bit of a strain, but you'll get used to it.<br /><br />The film comes in two versions, an unrated extended version and the original theatrical version. I only watched the latter.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I had the entire National Lampoon's Vacation series except for this one. So I finally broke down and ordered it. Now they're everywhere. But that doesn't matter as I love this movie. It has become required viewing as part of our Christmas movies, and the kids love it.
1607066017|5.0|I read it, my boyfriend read it, and my roommate read it, and we all loved it! Excellent story-telling, combined with a great art style made it a read that none of us could put down. My only complaint is that I want more!!
B0011UBDTK|3.0|Some of the dvds hang up.  We tested them on several dvd players, including computers and tv dvds.  We know that this is a manufacturing poor quality control and not the sellers.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Strong, emotional communication.  Adele inspires me to rise above and set fire to the rain and burn off the bad.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I love this controller. I have had carpal tunnel surgery on both hands and this controller makes playing games so much easier as it allows me to relax my hand while playing. I use it to play DC Universe Online that way I don't have to run the number keys across the top of the keyboard. Does it make me a better player, not in my case as I'm not that coordinated anyways, but it sure keeps my hand from killing me after playing for awhile. I also used it for Star Wars Online and it was nice being able to switch between games with the key layout being different for each one. Give it a go! It's worth the price.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a great game. Me and my friend love to play this game bcuz it's so much fun .thank you
B00881VLCE|2.0|When it tried to use it I could not bring the puzzle up so was unable to use it. would like to try it but do not know what to do

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great nook and I love the author I have read many of his books and this one is great like all the others
B00571F26Y|3.0|Davis' thesis is interesting and the changes in wheat are definitely there.  However, I was really bothered by his tendency to lambast many studies, while not following scientific method for his own thesis.  His conclusions, in the end, are tantalizing but not clearly supported by scientific studies.  He overstates his case.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I remember when JFK was shot and killed.  I had just turned 5.  I love this book because it took me<br />back to the time when life was simpler; my parents were young and still alive; and my whole life was still before me.  If I could time travel - I would.  If I knew then what I know now, my life would be very different.  Excellent book with which to fall back in time..
B0045HCJSK|5.0|It's John Wayne.  So you cannot go wrong.  A strong man that defends what is right regardless of the personal cost.  We need more of those in charge in this world.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was one of those books that was way predictable, but I guess in some way it is what keeped me reading. It was a good book and I would defiantly recommend it.
B006J420UE|5.0|This is primarily made for gaming and it works very well with gaming, I can run Skyrim with this but it's running at low frames but playable. Recommended for gamers on a budget and well worth the money
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Star Wars: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV - VI) [Blu-ray]<br /><br />Blue-ray set has great visuals. Best version of Star Wars to date.
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|I read all these reviews about his uninspired,unenthusiastic performances of a lot of the old songs.Well what would one expect.Elvis was very smart in every way.He knew that the crowds came to hear all the old songs,he had plenty of new stuff that was not being marketed and promoted well.He did not want his concerts to turn into the \\"Garden Party\\",that Rick Nelson sang about when he came to Madison Square Garden and tried to do his new stuff and got booed off stage.That probably was a risk that he should have taken,he could have pulled it off.It would have brought on new inspiration for him.Besides that the cd and songs are still better than anything else on the planent,don't give up on one listen.Relive the memories of the era.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I have many favorite blogs that I read and google reader allows me to keep track of them with no hassle. It is by far one of my favorite apps!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great for the end of a series. An incredible story of Katniss and Peeta. Perfect ending great for all ages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My niece plays this on her IPAD and i thought it looked like fun.  She is 7 and very good at this game.  Me, much older and not so good... but it is a fun game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think there should be no ads because none will get them they just want to play the game.All the ads are for adults,but I have to say it is a very good game.
B004X2M9VY|4.0|I wanted to watch season 6 to get caught up in this series. I held off getting into this show because I thought it would be too hard and time consuming to catch up. Not hard at all. The characters really develop over time. Doctor 11 is fun and wonderful. Great stories if you love scifi and fantasy all rolled in one.
0062209078|4.0|Having the writer voice his excitement, and react to his story adds to the experience.<br />A wonderful treat indeed.  Highly recommended.
B001QEJQY0|5.0|For fans of this magnificent tenor -- probably unsurpassed since Caruso, in my opinion -- this is a must have.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Really enjoy solitary .My wife holds the lowest time's on both of our Kindles.Kindle 7\\"at 45 seconds& kindle 5\\" at 55seconds. Really helps relieve the stress of running 2 businesses.Wish it would keep multiple players stats.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|The workouts are easy to understand and perform.  You can always reduce the number of reps and build up over time to what's suggested. Great job.  Thanks.  :&#62;))
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really good game if a little repetitive!! I really enjoy playing it although I have been put to shame by my 3 year old daughter who is way better than me!!<br /><br />It does take ages to initially build up enough coins to upgrade. You need to do this to get any kind of high score. You can buy coins but I refuse to when it's basically a game for my kids!<br /><br />New zones and obstacles would be good but it is great fun!
0741470314|5.0|I'havent finish the book yet - buy what I have read so far, are bringing Michael Jacksons life to my heart. He is so mush a human being in al the greatness, that I have never imagined. The book is very well written, it make me glad, but also sad, because it seem so unfair how people treated Michael Jackson. If you did'nt love the man before, you will suddenly do, after reading.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It was addicting game, I love it!!!! Plus it was free!!!! But there are way too many adds, when I first got the game, there were no adds at all. That is the only bad  part, besides that,I highly recommend the  game! :))
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Watched the whole series in one night! Loved it from Beginning to end! Hubby was the one who wanted me to watch it... He already seen Twilight, New Moon, Eclispe, Breaking Dawn part 1..... I never read the book either.... All I can say is I enjoyed the entire story... And it was not to girly for us, seeing that their are Werewolves and Vampires in it...
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Without doubt one of the best books I have read.  Paulo Coelho has combined adventure, travel, philosophy and magic to create this masterpiece.<br />This is one of those rare novels which appeals to an ageless and international audience - it can be read and enjoyed on different levels, I enjoyed it when I was very young, every time I read it I discover another.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|An exciting epic drama that I could hardly wait till Monday to watch. I ordered the season pass which stated that the latest episode would post shortly after it aired. The pass worked fine except for the different times the newest episode would show up on my wii.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|The latest craze seems to be the film Silver Linings Playbook, which began as a small independent film with limited release, and grew to amass a box office return more than 10 times its budget (at the time of writing).  I saw this movie in theater just after it made it to my town in January and was blown away by the acting by the always-complex Jennifer Lawrence and the usually-shallow Bradley Cooper.  Perhaps as intriguing, the film is based on the 2008 debut-novel by Matthew Quick.<br /><br />The biggest surprise had to be Bradley Cooper's performance.  In my opinion, this is the first role he's played that truly had any amount of depth.  His character had a number of mental illnesses that prohibited him (and his family) from leading a normal life.  His goal is to get his act together and get his wife to take him back.  He plans to do this by finding the \\"silver linings\\" in everything, essentially finding small positive ways to look at every situation.  This isn't easy, as he has anger issues on top of his other disorders.  Hope seems lost, until he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence).<br /><br />Tiffany is another example of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG), which I've discussed in previous posts.  The story is less about her personality and mental disorders, and more about how her presence helps Patrick (Bradley Cooper) get his life back.  It's rare with the MPDG motif that the girl actually is manic from a mental illness.  In this case, the motif just plain works.  Tiffany and Patrick are right for each other on so many levels, the audience is rooting for them from the start.

B005HSL626|3.0|It just seems to repititious to me and not really a game for an older person, I guess young children enjoy it
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I learned about this app through a Stress Management class. I downloaded the free version and found it extremely nice when it comes to relaxing or falling asleep. I purchased the paid version for under a dollar and have no regretted one second of it. I choose my sound files and adjust the volume on each, set the timer for twenty minutes and select that I want to close the app when the timer is up. I've recommended it to just about everyone, friends and new mothers whose baby couldn't fall asleep after the power went out since he was used to white noise.
B004TI5N38|4.0|This is another great book from David Baldacci. It is detailed, and more importantly, it is believable. As a retired military officer, I find some of the goings on within the military aspects of the story somewhat misleading, but this is still a well conceived and written tale that kept me interested to the final page.
0688091717|5.0|I was invited to a baby shower where the mom-to-be requested books for her new baby.  Not being a Mom and out-of-touch with babies, I asked my great-nephews what their favorite book was.  After much consideration, this was their recommendation.  Given all of the books these two boys own, I thought that was high praise.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I would have to reveal the ending and I won't do that......overall, very good book.....well written and a good story
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Such a great little film! The landscapes are really beautiful and well-designed, and the characters are just adorable. There are, not only throw-back to classic Disney designs throughout the movie, but throwbacks to arcade and various other classic video games. The disc's special features are really interesting and funny as well. From discussions on the various gamer references and easter eggs throughout the film, to mock commercials for the three major arcade games in the movie. Great fun for all!
B000EXZI1E|4.0|No tune on here that knocks one to the floor but every tune is beautiful and the harmonies are stupendous! Very Bee Gee like but in the right way. Not that there's a wrong one...just beautiful, well crafted music that certainly will prove timeless.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Beautifully written book about a very difficult subject.  I really liked how she told the story of different character's points of view.  Jodi Piocult is a wonderful writer and I would recommend this book for all parents and grandparents of teenagers.  I've read other books by this author and she never disappoints.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The book was very interesting and funny. I would recommend this book to a friend in class because it gives them something to do when they're bored

B000J4OYRW|4.0|A documentary that seems like one...not a bad thing but not a very entertaining view of these guys. I am happy to see how much the boys are loved by their fellow artists...I definately find them two or three stages above garden variety brilliant.
B00BF11STU|5.0|I Wasn't sure what to expect and ended up being thoroughly impressed! Very well done! I highly recommend this movie! So glad to see such a strong female lead in a historically significant true story.
B00BOLE7X0|4.0|So brilliant I had to watch it twice. Once with the subtitles on. Sophisticated tale that shows an Abraham Lincoln few of us know from our elementary school history lessons. Made me want to learn more. Oh, to live in 1864 for one week.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|If you watch 'The Hobbit', bring sunglasses and a bucket of patience because you'll need both. This movie single-handedly George Lucas'd the LoTR franchise.<br /><br />Jacksons Axl Rose-like obsessions led to over-saturated frames and poor storyline alterations. Gandalf suddenly suspects something sinister is going on - so are you telling me at the beginning of LoTR he decides to celebrate with fireworks while suspecting the end of all things was coming? Seriously?<br /><br />Stupid alterations to soften the stark contrast between The Hobbit and LoTR leads to a feeling of money-grabbing and/or flat-out poor craftmanship.<br /><br />As for the oversaturation, this is no small issue. Every time there is a blade of green grass on screen, grab those glasses because you'll need them. The entire movie is rendered into a Tim Burton-esque Pee-Wee's Playhouse of neon color and poor interpretations of nature.<br /><br />Disappointed, Mr. Jackson. I am for real.

1449325947|5.0|This book builds on version 2.0 (which is also excellent) by incorporating new CSS3 tricks (transforms, animations, transitions). It's an excellent primer. Some HTML background is a must, and this book does a great job introducing CSS to the reader. There are plenty of examples to practice with - each are \\"real world\\" - in the sense that you can take what you've learned and apply the knowledge directly to your own web designs.<br /><br />CSS3 is still in a state of flux, and a few of the comments (animation-delay, for example) aren't working for me, as they are described within the book. Also new to this third edition is responsive web design - which is necessary to develop custom experiences based on the screen size the viewer is using to view your page.<br /><br />I teach two web design courses. This is the book I recommend for my second web design course. It's imminently useful, easy to read, and filled with many practical examples. Highly recommended.
1400069742|5.0|In the 30's,as the Nazi's rose to power, many Americans felt that America's involvement in the First World War was a mistake: the European conflicts had not been resolved, and America had lost its sons for no reason. Coming conflicts in Europe were seen by many to be just another chapter in an unending squabble between nations with a long history of disputes.  Most Americans felt that American should stay out of the war.<br /><br />In this superb slice of history, Olson shows how American opinion changed. Charles Lindbergh, the American aviator, is one of the voices for isolationism, while Franklin Roosevelt is a voice for being prepared. The author uses these two voices as a framework for the story, but introduces us to many others who had a key role in the vigorous and sometimes ugly debate about whether Americans should arm.<br /><br />I am always excited when I learn a lot about a topic with which I thought I was familiar. I learned a lot about this period. It shows FDR's infuriating vacillation between supporting Britain and unwillingness to commit to intervention. It explores the role of the British Ambassadors to the US, the secret British propaganda campaign to engage the sympathy of Americans, and much more. It has a nuance depiction of various isolationist views - rather than the monolith that I pictured them to be, I discovered that some were opposed on grounds of pacifism, others on pragmatics (\\"we can't win\\"), and yet others on issues of unpaid British debt. The isolationists fought among themselves, as well as against those who wanted to assist Britain.<br /><br />This book also is an interesting case study in the shaping of public opinion in American politics. Nonintervention was a hugely divisive issue, and both sides marshalled a wide range of tactics to persuade the public and shape legislation. Some of these tactics will seem very familiar. It is also fascinating to watch how opinion evolves over a two year period.<br /><br />A splendid book - well written, beautifully researched, and offering a fascinating view of a crucial point in American history.l written, beautifully researched, and offering a fascinating view of a crucial point in American history.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|The beginning was interesting although repetitive at times.  The ending leaves you adrift. It seems you have to order the nest book to resolve ending in this book. I do not like to read continued stories. Reminds me ofa soap oper.
B008BZIUHG|2.0|I keep wondering why these guys aren't universally applauded when I here their first offerings on each new CD...and then I realize that the promoted songs are the only songs that are very interesting. Makes me sad...so much promise!!!!
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Clutch comes roaring out of the gate on this one, only slowing down midway for a brief moment before continuing their onslaught.<br /><br />If you have liked ANY clutch - Beale Street, Blast Tyrant -- you must get this one.  It is what they promised;  straightforward and ballsy hard rock.  The title track alone is an instant classic.<br /><br />The consistently good rock this band puts out is what drives me to buy a Clutch sticker for my vehicle.  One has to spread the good word, or at least let your support be known.  I hope one day very soon to witness Clutch live in concert.  Missed them last year at H.O.B, but I won't make that mistake again.<br /><br />Thanks Clutch, seeya soon!!
B0015I2P0Y|3.0|This isn't a bad album, but it isn't particularly interesting either. I couldn't really get into it even though I like several of the bands that Elbow sounds like.  The songs didn't grab me and were just too edgeless for me.
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|I have been a fan of Mads Mikkelsen for years he is a great actor and I really hope he doesn't stop making films.That being said.<br />He is the reason I watched, but the series (writing) is intriguing and pulls you in from the beginning.Hugh Dancy does a great job,and his character<br />Graham seems to have some hidden secrets and problems of his own. Hannibal also does alot of cooking and eating, looks good to you realize he's eating humans.<br />Similar to \\"The Killing\\" series,a little out of the ordinary but interesting. Definately worth watching at least the series premiere.<br />Still a fan of Mads but I hope he doesn't give up his film career.
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|Got this version for the :&#34;infamous&#34; christmas special episode that was advertised and much talked about.  I couldn't find it. Otherwise, good!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|You do not have to enjoy live shows to appreciate the fantastic performances of all the main charactors.  This is one of the most powerful and intense movies I have ever watched!  The actors true abilities are allowed to flourish in live performances while conveying a great , but essentially a simple story of how one act of kindness can change a person's life!
0761163808|5.0|This book makes an excellent gift..or just to rest around your living room...definitely attracts a lot of attention..and the techonology behind it is really amazing...moving animals..etc..you should check it out
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|I like Ivan.  He is a fun character in the Vorkosiverse and has played critical roles in many of the other stories, but in this one as the hero he was transformed.<br />This one is less space opera and more love story.  I am still a fan and am glad to have this story as a part of the overall vision, but the overall timeline of this universe does not feel like it has grown ... unless Lois had to put this in place to lay the groundwork for a big up coming adventure?<br />I remain optimistic.<br />Fans of the series will not be able to pass this book by.  Newbies to the series will probably be disappointed.
0345803485|1.0|LESS than ZERO.  My goal is to make sure no one else buys this ridiculously written piece of teenage fantasy 'plagerism' penned by (an adult) preposterous author, and thus hopefully have her profits consfiscated! I know 1,000 people more qualified to explain erotic adventures than the stupid trype offered in this trilogy. Save your 25.00 or more dollars and call a flippin' 900 sex line. JEEzzz!! Enough already with people who think WE need to get a life! Like this type of book hasn't been written before...100 times better without being plagerized??
B005NPCUC8|5.0|this is one of the best of classic Rock Pink floyd knows how to take me where i want to be
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There is a reason this show is such a ratings hit.  Great acting, directing and writing.  I found this season, the best shows were the more intimate episodes (I know people love to see the weekly zombie slaughter).  When Rick and the Govenor meet to talk treaty, its subtle intensity will keep you enthralled.  The finale was a bit low key, but still enjoyable enough to make you look forward to Season 4.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoy this series.  It is just a good solid story that works.  There is talk of a movie and that makes perfect sense.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful, high-quality soap opera with great writing and acting.  If you can forgive them for killing-off key characters, you will enjoy it very much.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great show. Each episode is better than the last. Don't want it to end. Would definitely recommend to any adult.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I highly recommend The Book Thief.  Superbly written.  Character development is excellent - reader will never forget any of them.  It is a new favorite of mine.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We loved the first season of Once Upon a Time on Netflix so much that we just had to get the second season as well.  It was worth its weight in gold.  Very entertaining and enjoyable show, and paying for a TV pass meant we got to watch it the day after it came out.
B0011Z32KI|4.0|Mike is such a wonderfully, smooth crooner you will like anything he sings.  The covers he chooses are good; but all not so enthralling as &#34;I'm Feeling Good&#34; (the break out hit from the album).

B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This movie is just cute. The little girls are cute, the minions are very cute, and the change in the evil guy is great.  Good family film.
B0041KKYDI|2.0|I experienced a documentary several years ago about this gentleman who had to amputate his own flesh in a canyoneering accident. It was TV, and I don't relegate to memory much of what is on TV, but several times over the years a vivid memory of it would just hit me out of nowhere. It must have moved me at some core level, but I could not recall much detail of the documentray, or even the gentleman's name, so I didn't search terribly hard for it. Then my friend described an awesome film called \\"127 Hours\\" about a man who had to amputate his own hand. She described the film a bit, and I figured, \\"This must be it! At last I've found it.\\" So I rented it at the library, and even in the first few minutes I realized, this weren't it, brother.<br /><br />I don't think I could have liked this movie even if I had not seen the documentray first. But having first seen \\"NBC presents Survivor: the Aron Ralston Story, with Tom Brokaw\\" (2006) my stomach turned with every passing minute of watching \\"127 Hours.\\" It's just a poorly presented Hollywood version of an incredible true story. I won't go into how juvenile the movie portrays Ralston, and the flashnback scenes drag on and on and on. By the end of the movie, with the man's name now known to me, I comitted to find the documentary I remembered that was so moving, instead of this Hollywood drivel. Thank goodness it is still available. Search it out. It wraps you up inside of Ralston's head as he is going through the ordeal, with great effect using his own video footage, instead of the drivel in 127 hours.

B009FZFONO|4.0|I jumped on the Walking Dead train late and was catching up on my episodes. This episode fell between what was available on Netflix and what was saved on On Demand. I'm so glad Amazon had the right episode and I was able to watch it when I wanted to!

1439152802|4.0|Although only my second Kate Morton book, it is obvious she has a formula ... but what a wonderful, involving formula it is!!<br /><br />I enjoyed The Secret Keeper even better than The Forgotten Garden, though the intergenerational mystery and the going back and forth in time felt familiar. This story focuses on the secrets kept by a mother and one of her daughter's attempts to unravel these secrets. What kind of person was her mother when she was young? Why did she react the way she did when a mysterious stranger visited the family home one day in the 1960s? The answers to these questions are quite interesting, and Morton keeps a few surprises tucked up her sleeve to reveal at the end--surprises that I found very gratifying and realized I had unconsciously hoped for. If you're looking for an engrossing, sprawling big fat novel, you'd can't go wrong with this one. I listened to it on audio, and the narrator (Caroline Lee) was superb. I've heard she narrates all of Morton's books so I'll be sticking to audio for all my future Morton books.
B00AP06III|5.0|I love Harry Potter, and the digital version means I don't have to mess with DVDs anymore.  I can watch the digital version whenever I want.

B00ANYD2OE|5.0|Cricket. ♥ St. Clair. ♥<br /><br />Ahh! Stephanie Perkins owns. I loved Anna and the French Kiss, but I loved this one even more! It was so freaking good and perfect! One of my favorite books this year! Probably my favorite so far.<br /><br />Lola and Cricket were amazing, and the appearances from Anna and St. Clair were awesome. Just like with Anna, I couldn't stop laughing and fangirling, and I couldn't put this book down. I love when a book makes me smile and forces me to finish reading it in one day. (My expectations for Isla and the Happily Ever After are pretty high now!)<br /><br />I don't think I can write a proper review for Lola. It's one of those books I adored so much that I can't seem to find the right words to express how I feel. All I can say is... JUST READ THIS BOOK!
B009GX7IRA|4.0|I usually LOVE watching NCIS; I have done marathons of the first several seasons before.  I'm wondering if this might be the last season, though, because it seems like they're spending a lot of time focusing on the personal lives of each of the characters.  That, and it's getting to the point where you need to have seen a few of the previous episodes to enjoy the current episode.  I preferred it when the episodes were able to stand alone.
0142410705|4.0|Another John Green, I was excited to read another great book. I knew it would be. I have enjoyed every book I have read by him and I especially like them on audio. This was another great book. More humorous and less sad it was a happy read. Full of colorful characters, a road trip, and a little bit of romance, it was a big book of good stuff. I really liked the narrator too. I think he really caught the essence of Colin.<br /><br />Long Story Short<br /><br />Colin is obsesses with girls named Katherine... no spelling variations, no nicknames, just Katherine. He is about to start college when he is dumped by Katherine19 after dating just shy of a year. He is crushed. His best friend, Hassan, talks him into a road trip. Plans for nowhere in particular they end up in Gutshot Tennessee where they meet Lindsey Lee Wells and her mother and where they decide to stay for a while. During the their time in Tennessee, Collin decides to come up with a theorem on predicting how long a relationship with last with the next girl named Katherine. What Collin learns cannot be contained in a there<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />Loved the book, knew I would, and I will ramble on about how good the book is.<br /><br />I am quite familiar with the seriousness and sadness generally contained in John Green's book so the happy humor in this story really took me by surprise. I wasn't quite expecting what I got, but I am so OK with that. This book was fun. Nothing too deep, just some good old fashioned light reading with that something special that John Green puts in all of his books. I was hooked from the beginning and in a trance to the end. I enjoyed the characters greatly and I think that may just be the something special.. the characters.<br /><br />I liked Colin, he was interesting to say the least. He was unusual, geeky, smart, and little strange. I loved the way his mind worked and how honest he was. He didn't find the value in telling someone what they want to hear but instead telling it like it is. He was a great character but not the one who stole the show for me. The star of the book for me was Hassan.<br /><br />Hassan can't really be put in words... but I will try in 5.. humorous lazy funny looking nerd. ... doesn't sound like a great mixture, but I enjoyed him immensely. I have read late. He always knew how to say and do the right thing. He also has a knack for making everyone love him. He is not the type that looks like people flock to him, but in this book they do. He is also a very loyal friend. He allows Colin to be the one in charge, the one up front, and the center of attention. What Colin needs or wants, Hassan allows. He tries to keep honest in what he does and follow the rules of his religion. His only fallback... he is pretty much lazy, but it didn't change my opinion of him.<br /><br />I really liked the story. I am not sure what was so appealing about a guy who is obsessed with Katherines but between the flashbacks and the present happenings, I just couldn't get enough. Colin thinks he has it all figured out, but he really doesn't. The story is about friendship, loss, and love, the three things that always get me. I was surprised how light the book was but it didn't lack because of it. The characters still had issues, still had to grow, and there were some emotional ups and downs.. but the ups overpowered the downs and it kept the book fun.<br /><br />In the End<br /><br />I think I will read anything by John Green. This book is definitely different than the last 2 I read, but still awesome. I wasn't disappointed and I remain a John Green fan!lling it like it is.

B000PH40HM|2.0|Did not hate the movie, only reason did not give it one star. The story and idea of a movie coming to life and Danny Mannigan being part of his favorite character's movie is cool; something most of us could all probably relate to in some fashion or another. It's entertaining for what it's worth and plays on creative imagination, but I would not give this movie another shot. One and done is all it deserves I believe. Other than that,  super cheesy lines and kid Danny is a horrible actor that overshoots his reactions and facial expressions. I know the movie in the movie is intended to have bad puns as to give the viewers an idea of a good action/bad dialogue type movie, but even the whole movie overall contains some of the worst puns in the history of movies; and did Arnold really have to say \\"I'll be back\\"? (More than once) Its as if though he is doing a cameo as Terminator....character within a character, within a movie thats within a movie. Too much! As long as you like Arnold, this movie is bearable and has a few laughs along with decent action. But I would not buy this movie because all it will probably be good for is collecting dust.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the game so addicting but you might not like it if you get frustrated and throw things. I get frustrated but not like that. The game could help relieve stress.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Castle is just a fun show.  After watching Serenity and Firefly, I loved seeing all the mentions of those shows in this one, and all of the characters are likable enough that I enjoy watching this show.  It is still a crime show, so if you're not into those, you won't like this one, but it's different in that it doesn't take itself as seriously.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This was one I thought would hold the attention of my three yr old son, 10 yr old daughter and myself for a little mid week bonding. It was the perfect film. There are quite a few hilarious adult undertones that went right over my three yr olds head and a number of solid lessons within the story that my ten yr old caught onto. A definite family film!

Reacher is the person we all wish we could be but the author and the ideology is what we are all hungry for.  I really need to get baqck to reality where I am fighting a Father and Son that the Navy has backed in taking a Federally Funded asset and made it their own.  Child could not possibly put that level of corruption in one of these books.  He does come close...

B00ANYJ3NI|4.0|Lewis does a great job explaining the causes of the 2007/2008 financial collapse in an accessible, entertaining way. The book, for all its length, was a quick read.<br /><br />The book does not pretend to be a comprehensive history of the crisis or the machinations of the people involved. (If you are looking for that, check out Sorkin's excellent book.) It is an engaging story of the people who saw the collapse coming, tried to raise warnings, were ignored, and finally invested in a way to profit from the coming crash.<br /><br />On Wall Street, money is the ultimate way to keep score. The protagonists in \\"The Big Short\\" placed their bets in a such a way that nobody can dispute their right to say \\"I told you so.\\"

Rather than spend many paragraphs talking about how amazing the content is, I'll cut to the chase:<br /><br />This book will teach you CSS3, Good Practices, Why it's Useful, and how you can create Responsive websites with it. I didn't read very in-depth because I already know and use CSS3, however it's a great review book.<br /><br />And now on to The Missing Manual.<br /><br />This is a great book format. Many technical books are either too boring, too gimmicky, or they don't teach you well. The missing manual contains some classes Gimmicks, however they're scattered and formatted well. Some examples:<br />\\"Notes\\". They were formatted to interrupt you on purpose. Rather than be tucked away, they help reinforce information while you're reading. They were very helpful.<br />Sections separated smartly.<br />The black-on-white format of the missing manual is used to it's advantage, with simple graphics and a great layout.<br /><br />If you want to learn everything about CSS3, this is a great place to start.

B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a game I've played on my computers for years, and now I have it on my Kindle.  Plays great, and I like the feature where you can just &#34;tap&#34; without dragging a sequence to another pile.  This will get lots of use on camping trips, etc.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Wow wat a great  game to play it is so awesome  !!!!!!!!!!! Love this game play it 24/7 it's awesome
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was quite entertaining and the music was fun. This is coming from someone who hates musical movies/shows. Anna Kendrick was adorable.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|I always have to work with the cord (cabel) to get contact for charging on and off the whole time it's charging.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This was the free version with ads, but the game is fun.  It is easy to move on to the next level and pretty much ignore the ads, but obviously would be better without the ads. But, hey, it was free ... and it's fun!  Nice graphics too!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The book has more of a plot...more raw in more ways than one.<br />Looking forward to the third and final.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This was a nice pick up in the pace from season 2. More action, more plots, less sitting around. Some episodes did feel useless, though. As if they didn't need them to move the plot forward.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Best game on my kindle fire.  i will play for hours  on end. recmemed to every person on the erath
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is top of the line production and writing and every other aspect is wonderful.  Definately a must see.  We have watched these episodes over a few times and the continue to entertain.
B00B9DTZWG|5.0|Positively LOVED it! Looking forward to season 4 and hopefully, more to come after that!! These folks are SO real.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I expected this to be much funnier. The funniest parts were already given up on the commercials so the rest was just filler. I did love that John Lithgow was in the movie though, he's always great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is is great game I'm sooo glad I found this game its the best thing to keep me occupied! Thank you who ever made this game.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|The story moves on in a good way .... The text runs well and a good plot in the story and it keeps upp with the first book
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great story. My work suffered as a result of my need to finish reading this book, a real page turner!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|It took a minute to realize why Gordon Levitt looked so strange, they literally morphed him into a young Bruce Willis using prosthetics on his nose and ears. He was brilliant in capturing Willis' demeanor. The film was not what I expected, and was a thrilling ride.
B005OGYH90|5.0|This album and DVD manage to capture the essence of the Slash live experience. Buy this whether you've seen them live or not.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|lots to learn. All options should be available to earn without havering to buy with stars.Early frustration no real guidlines
B00A50PDDY|5.0|This album by Twenty One Pilots is just a fantastic and very well done album.  Vessel has very touching but complex lyrics and it all works with the electronic, piano, and the drums.  The singers voice is unique but works well with what he is playing with his drummer.  The drummer in this band also does great job since he makes great rythyms to go with the piano.  The best example of that is the song \\"Gun For Hans\\" and it is personally my favorite song off this album.  Editing is also another great aspect of this album and just adds to how well put together this album is.  I say you should definitely go check this band out and this album because I loved it and I think you will too.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|Good tuner for the money...<br />true bypass, easy to read and compact !<br />if you need an affordable tuner this is the one !
B0064QNS62|2.0|Being a gamer from the 1990, I can without a doubt tell you how horrible of a game this is. Having a played thousands of games on pc and hundreds on my kindle fire hd, this game is no were near a pay to play quality game. The mechanics of the game are very clunky and slow probably intentionally for a more retro look, but how far back were the developers of this one trying to go? Beats me. Even as a free game this is bad.I'd avoid at all cost. Why 2 stars you ask? Well the effort of there was any.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|As usual a must read from Dan Brown,I eagerly await his next novel.Highly recommend you purchase this book to read and archive for your convenience.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought this was a great way to end this trilogy I truly enjoyed the read Unlike any other book I have read
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is wonderful! It's great for passing the time. I love how it's a world tour. It's really fun to travel around the world right at home.I love this app! I highly recommend this to you!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I cannot watch this movie enough!  It is really good, and the more I watch it, the more I like it.  I highly reccommend the movie and the seller.
B003954I9C|5.0|I LOVE this CD. AJ really shows who he is on this CD. I have been a BSB fan since 1995, and AJ did not disappoint with this album. There are some songs that are how you say (not suitable for children) there is also the BEST breakup song EVER ( I Quit) AJ hit this one outta the park, just wish there could have been more advertising and promotion, so the album could have reached the status it rightly deserves. If you are a BSB fan, you will love it! KTBSPA!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love this game. Doesn't break your arm to make you spend money on it. You dont need to connect with a bunch of friends if you dont want too. Good variety of dinos.
B005HSL626|3.0|It is what it sounds like it is. Not much more than a good time waster but for that it very good. Entertaining at least.<br />I'm glad I got it for free. If I had paid a lot for it I would be disappointed. I'm not going to spend any money on the upgrades -mostly because I'm frugal - but also because they wouldn't be worth it to me. I don't know how much more they would truly add to the game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best season so far but needed a better ending. No good direction for upcoming season. AMC will deliver in season 4. Every season gets better. Great job AMC !!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I loved playing this!!! I did not put it down until i got done playing it. I would highly recommend you play this.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|just heavy enough to weather a long life of use. Easy to carry my kindle in and it protects it (dropping, scratches, etc,..) from damage. Stands up nicely on my knees or in a laid down position while reading, etc.<br /><br />Very well made. I wish it came in more colors.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really like this and may even now go back and look at getting the first version. My only comment is that I can't play it while on the elliptical because I find myself moving and tilting too much while on the machine because I am trying to &#34;help&#34; the character. Means the game is involving but it really screws up my workout! Good game though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I found the Hunger Games Trilogy to be a fun fast paced series. The first movie hardly does the book justice, although it closely follows the book, there are just so many well built characters and scenes you can't capture on screen. I loved the twists, turns, and surprises throughout the novels. I could hardly put them down!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a really good book I loved all  the care and love it kinda scared me that he was following her...I'm glad I read the book before I saw the move!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is so addicting once you start you wont stop it will bring out the competitive side of you it is worth downloading
B009QW7HMC|4.0|Season 3 was rich in characters - every one of them added mew dimensions and changed during the season. The relationships between them also grew and changed. Things I loved about characters (without spoilers):<br />Love:<br />Carol's sense of humor (finally!) and keep observations about her fellows - she is finally sticking up for herself. Not loving some of her hair - too fuzzy.<br /><br />Maggie's warrior woman and her passion for winning and loving. She still had vulnerability but did not cry or fight with people all season. She is combining farm girl and street fighter - love.<br /><br />Rick's emotional swims and fierce mew approach to problems. Great acting by AL.<br /><br />Daryl's allegiance to the group as its #1 supporter and defender. Also his tender side and the glimpses we get of his past with Merle. Also loved Merle's changes this season. Q: Why is Daryl sporting goth-ish hair? Did he hijack a hair color truck?<br /><br />Also loved Hershel, liked Andréa and liked the Gov (loved to hate). Glen was okay - he seemed angry and quiet a lot, which misses out on Yuen's great comic abilities. Loved Michionne's action scenes with the sword. Did mot really get interested in her as a person until the last 3 episodes or so.<br />Loved action sequences, especially the ones at the prison or on the bridge with Daryl. Oh - also loved Morgan in Clear.<br /><br />Did not like the following things/people:<br />Carl - a grim angry little guy - very grating. I never fell in love with this character before he became irritating and sullen. Mot the actor's fault though - go back in the house Carl.<br />Woodbury - Too much time there with too few relatable/likeable characters. Thank goodness for Milton. Sometimes I read during these scenes or even skipped them.<br />Lori - Yawn. Too much bad marriage/love affair/baby story. She was her own Lifetime movie of the week.<br />Beth - Triple yawn. She hits one mote with this character - the same sweetie pie mote every time. The writers need to shake it up.<br />There was a lot to love and several things to dislike for me,  but overall I recommend this season - great stuff here!

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Short but funny I have read longer books than this of his they are a bit better and funnier but still good.
1476733953|5.0|I gave this book a five star rating because I could not put it down! I read furiously throughout the Easter weekend, and finished it with regret.<br /><br />Hugh Hovey has created a believable world which I was able to embrace without reservation. There is little explanation of the setting, the whole reality stems from the narrative. Similarly, there is little description of appearance of characters and settings, only those necessary in the story telling, and gradually the world of the underground towers becomes real. I found the whole idea of the relentless climbing and descending of the staircases very powerful, and could easily imagine the crowded interior of the silo. I really enjoyed the resulting stark realism of the story.<br /><br />The plot development was very well done, with a slow unravelling (wool!) throughout all of the 'books'. I found the characters well drawn and engaging and I liked that I was left to imagine so much about them using hints from the story telling. I liked the humanity of the characters, especially their fallibility, but also their credibility as people.<br /><br />In SF character and environment sometimes get little emphasis, and in this book they are given their place. When added to the fact that this book is also well-written and  edited, I had no hesitation in giving five stars to such an exciting novel.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I'm a big fan of the show now I'm a big fan of the book great detailing. Would recommend to everyone
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found the Hunger Games Trilogy to be a fun fast paced series.

B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is a beautiful tale of a boy named Santiago which reminds us we are all capable of miracles and wonders in our life . You heart will enjoy this feast of love.
B009Q6ADG0|1.0|Only one song....and for too much money. I expected to listen to a full disc and instead only 4 minutes
B0058VW36U|4.0|I bought the game for my son. He loves it would spend hours on it if we let. He does get stuck on some levels, he is 5, but he enjoys it. We like it because it requires basic problem solving skills. I would recommend this game for kids between the ages of 5 to 9. After that they might loose interest in it quickly.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|Documents to go does not work on the kindle and needs a secondary app to function. Kindle would need to come preloaded with google play app.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|I was so taken with this film when I saw it in the theater that I came home and immediately pre-ordered it.  It's a good storyline of a young man pursuing his dreams and the father figure/mentor (wonderfully played by Gerard Butler) who helps him.  The movie is based on a true story and has notes of comedy, romance, and drama, nicely blended.  I was pulled into the story quickly and it held my attention all the way through, even on my second viewing.  As a bonus, the scenery is absolutely incredible.  I would definitely recommend this movie, particularly to Gerard Butler fans.
B001FB55YE|5.0|Guy Richie did an excellent job of directing this film. I hadn't seen any of his work before this film. The cast was superb and the direction of their characters was witty and great fun to watch.
B007CFL4WO|5.0|This is a great modern novel; a novel one reads to become civilized.  In it Schlink shows us the life of a woman whose ethical sense awakens too late.  She becomes enlightened, as in Kant's definition, by gradually emerging from the immaturity that created her past. As her consciousness transforms and she evaluates the mechanical ways she carried out orders or repeated abuse, she can no longer live with herself.  She was born with moral sense but it is nascent and, undeveloped, allows her to participate in crimes.  Or she was born without moral sense and somehow later develops it.  Which is it?<br /><br />Reading this book allows one to explore the greyness of human behavior.  How do we become ethical?  It is very easy to draw the world in black and white, the good and the bad.  Germany's Nazi past is everyone's favorite example of human extremity. Yet Schlink doesn't take that easy road.  He asks the difficult questions, the real questions.  And leaves us to enlighten ourselves.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas sparks never fails to touch my heart with his masterful interpretations of the human experience. Although parts of the plot are somewhat predictable, the ending will leave you speechless!
B007REV4T8|2.0|Action, but story line trite, could have condensed the movie to save time because it was too long.  Let's hope the next one is better
B002S8AGZG|5.0|This was the first movie Heath Ledger did, Julia Styles and several others. It was done beautifully and I watch it often.
1439152802|5.0|Imagine watching your loving, nearly perfect mother stand on the front stairs of your farmhouse, put the baby down behind her and stab a man to death and then act as if this brutal act had little to do with her? You'd probably accept your mother's explanation of self-defense against a random attack. And so Laurel Nicolson did for fifty years. But now, when her mother is near the end of her life, a chance discovery of a photo and a gnawing sense that she's been keeping her mother's secret for too long, lead Laurel to question everything she understood about her family.<br /><br />At one point in The Secret Keeper I thought, oh, I've got this figured out and it's turning too predictable. Such hubris. I wasn't close and I can't talk much about the plot and its many twists, they are too much fun to fall for. In the course of the novel, you'll explore London during the blitz, family dynamics of the boisterous, lovingly squabbling sort and the violent, dangerous sort, misguided social climbing, mental delusions of the old and young, idyllic English countryside living, artistic talent and how it forms and drives personalities (and scientific talent, actually, now I think about it), wartime mentality and the strange choices people make when living with death all around them. Skilled, detailed character development with gradual revelations lies at the core of this book with a plot that turns out to be much trickier than it appears.
B006S053K8|4.0|It's gratifying to watch a film featuring real people in a real life situation, no explosions or special effects. Bill Hader's character was perfect in his position as the Adventureland manager, as though he's done it his entire life, and knows how to do it as efficiently as possible. I liked Kristen Stewart's understated beauty; it didn't instantly overwhelm. Her character seemed resigned to a negative fate, too cool to complain. The only problem I have with this film is that her character is too sexually experienced and sophisticated for the virgin young man who dreams of attending Columbia University. I also liked that character who trained him who also seemed resigned to a negative fate, yet realistic enough to dream with discretion.
B00000DFTG|5.0|Ths cd has the original members and there is a lot of classic songs on this cd and they sound real good considering these guys were up there in age. Some of my favorites are NIB and Dirty Women but all the other songs are real good too. Well worth buying for any Black Sabbath fans
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app works great. Allows me every access to my boards on par with the website. Definitely would recommend to any user
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn is one of my favorite writers. I almost said mystery writers, but her writing and story telling is so wonderfully above the usual writers in that genre, that Her work is more good literature than mystery.<br /><br />This story takes many twists and turns, and does become a bit unbelievable. And it is a long story. I don't want to give anything away, but just want to say I highly recommend this book, the best Flynn novel so far.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I chose to read this book because I heard the movie was good but confusing if you didn't read the book. I really liked the letter format of how the book was set up. I definitely recommend this book.
B00008CMR6|5.0|We have watched this movie many times and we never get tired of seeing it again, and again.<br />I would recommend this to someone wanting a western to watch.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|My granddaughter plays this game almost everytime she is here. It is one of her favorite games I have on the Kindle.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Well written, funny and entertaning book. The story is unique and keeps the reader guessing, if you like a good story you will love it.
B0074MZSWW|3.0|I first discovered this band at The Americana festival.The lead singer is amazing but this album has not grown on me even after a dozen listens.I'll probably keep the two good songs on it and trade the cd for something else most likely.I expect good things in the future though
B009NUV0E8|5.0|Pierce Brosnan's best bond and the needed jolt to the franchise.  Absolutely a classic as well as the best video game tie in ever.  The blu ray version is great but nothing overly unique.
B00BFTV09K|5.0|This book is well written and well researched. Thoroughly recommended. It will change your life... well, the way you eat.
B005HHSYMW|5.0|This book is very important, especially for those people who think the world is going downhill fast. This book debunks that theory completely, with such a brillant amount of quality research, to be irrefutable. It restored my faith in the future
B0050DIWFC|3.0|It started off fast, then drastically slowed. It dragged as the narrator (Jacob's father) tells his story. I don't like 1st person which is what this was, and I really did not enjoy the ending. But it was just, overall, an ok book.
B004EF65QA|5.0|If you liked Pride and Prejudice you will love North and South.  So.  Good.  I watch it about once a year.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It has good graphics and it travels around the world. I believe everyone should play it because the rush you get playing it.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|this is a little different from other John Grisham books, but i had alot of fun reading it. good read
B00BG08FKK|3.0|Starting with the first track, several songs have been shortened for this Deluxe Edition, including \\"Fantine's Arrest.\\"  Also, songs will sometimes lead into one another, so \\"Look Down\\" begins with Javert belting out, \\"Staaaaaaaaaaaars!\\"  Uh... wut?  Disappointed with these editing choices.<br /><br />  Otherwise, this soundtrack is wonderful.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|We rented PI over the Holiday, We wanted a Family movie we could enjoy. We all found that Pi deserved the Academy Awards earned recently. We really enjoyed it.
B00005N6KG|4.0|This is about my 5th pair.  They are light weight, easy on your ears (not tight, so you don't get earaches).  Only downfall, I would say ,is that the wires aren't tight enough going into them.  If the wires get hooked on something they start shorting out.  But, they are my favorite headphones and will continue to replace them whenever needed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app subway way surf is not only amazing but addictive I can not stop playing it is so gun it would be better if it had levels but what I like is that the places change it might be Rome Sydney. Anywere its a awesome free game
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|OMG..what a blast to play. you can play all night. your coins go fast but if you win prizes you can sell for additional coins. this is another addictive game but so worth the download..you will totally enjoy this game..
B002QS1O36|5.0|Who does not love the Phantom of the Opera. The kids fell in love with the movie in school and wanted this newer version
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I am having so much fun playing this game!  It`s hard to put down.  A great way to get your mind off things and relax.  I play it at night after a long day at work.  Thumbs up!  Great job Big Fish!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its pretty good. it keeps your attentionn just wish It were easier to get coins faster. other then that its a really good time killer.
B00002R0MC|5.0|This is a great collection, I love that it has his earlier recordings.<br /><br />Whats not to like, its Bob Marley!
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Gwyneth Paltrow never ceases to entertain. Kids rented this movie from Amazon online for a Class project and we all enjoyed it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids, ages 4 and 6 love playing this app. They enjoyed the original Temple Run, but seem to like this one even more.
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|&#34;The Thing&#34; (1951&1982) are favorites of mine.  This &#34;Prequel&#34; brings nothing new.  The cast and story are OK, but nothing too special.  I'd have spent my time better watching the 1982-Kurt Russell version again.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I have just read this book, and it is in true Jeffrey Archer form - absolutely fantastic.  I have read every book that Jeffery Archer wrote, and am fully up to date. It is my second most worst stress that I have to now wait until the next one comes out.  My worst stress is that anything might might happen that I might somehow not experience the 4th and 5th book in the series.  If I could wrap Jeffrey Archer up in cotton wool and place him in a bank vault for safekeeping, so that he could be sure to be safe while writing No. 4 and 5, and do the same with myself, so that I can be sure I would be able to read them, I would do that.<br />Thanks Mr Archer, you are my life line.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works like a dream - Use it every day. Read my Bible on it (Free Download) from Amazon. Reading Steve Jobs currently. Another great book.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|this is a good movie i bought it when it was a new release...then when i went to watch it all i could find was the case....when the wife gets a movie in her head she wants to watch lets just say it was a trip to walmart who didnt have it so it was a trip to my computer and amazon..a few days later happy wife..even though we got a new one the kids are still searchin for that dvd
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Good portrayal of Rio and the birds who live there.  I watch this again and again.  Very good computer animation.
B0067R0APK|3.0|I find this upgrade to Accuweather difficult and dislike the upgrade . Would like the SALE on the front to go away
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Was Thinking of going to the movie and though I would read the book also. Glad I did. Steve Jobs had quite an entertaining past.
6305428387|5.0|i just love john candy even the dumb movies he is in like canadian bacon......cool runnings however is not one of the dumb ones...i love this movie..my 9 year old daughter seemed to really like she has watched it in her room so many times i think she can recite it now
B000ICXQXI|5.0|First time I have ever viewed Psyco ! Truly the suspensful masterpiece by the great director Alfred Hitchcock.  Powerful story line too !
6305971935|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for a long time and I finally found it it is a good movie and  it was a good deal
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George RR Martin does NOT disappoint and this 5th book in the Game of Thrones series is great!  If you're looking for a good series to get hooked on.....here you go! And there is an HBO series as well!
B00425S1H8|5.0|This new model was required for Windows 8.  I had an older model that worked OK on Win 7 but not Win 8.  If you need a USB/RS232C (serial) adapter, this is the one.  Be sure to use the latest driver from the web site.
B004JK61K0|4.0|This E-mail system to me is much better than the one that comes with Kindle Fire. If you delete items with K-9 Mail, they are deleted and can be removed permanently from the server. They don't go back into your In Box, like the one that comes with Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is very good for my kid!!!!!<br />she loves it!!!!  :)<br />she is 5 and enjoys everything
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Seriously, I loved this book. I couldn't  put it down. I wish more books were this good. Let's make it 7 stars.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is wonderful in this role. His mannerisms, appearance, and voice sound like we would expect Lincoln<br />to be. Its almost like witnessing Mr. Lincoln for ourselves. Thanks to Steven Spierberg we have another most wonderful<br />film from this master!
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Patch Adams really shows how the medical system and Drs SHOULD really work. Be concerned for the person, not the disease or disorder !
B005LAIISA|5.0|My husband liked this & laughed several times while we watched it with our 6 year old grandson. I recommend it to anyone who has any of the previos Ice Age movies.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I am very good at this I can beat the game in a matter of a hour or two. I must have beaten it like 15 times already and that's when I reset the game beat all the plagues on brutal then reset it again I mean I so good at this and it never seems to get old. I would pay 6.00$ for this app if I had to that's how much I like this game. I like this app more than minecraft or any other app on the app store.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|GREAT CD THAT HAS ALL HIS HITS ON IT. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS I GO TO THE GYM AND WANTED TO DOWNLOAD IT ON MY IPOD TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC AND I WAS UNABLE TO GET IT TO DO THIS. I PLAY IT IN MY CAR THOUGH AND ENJOY IT VERY MUCH.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|This album has a TON of great tracks on it, &#34;Stay&#34; being one of my favorites! FGL is one of my favorites!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is really helpful for me because my parents have to use our  dogs to get me up and if that does not wake me up then they have to use a blow horn coz I sleep like a rock lol but anyway this is helpful cause I can set many alarms and make notes but hey it helps so I think you should try it :) ;)
B007VUCAVO|5.0|After trying many battery apps, this is the only one I can rate 5 stars. Very useful info and great graphics.
B00B671W6W|3.0|Been listening to Anthrax since 1988....Wasn't a big fan of the John Bush years, and am really happy Joey is back. Worship was great. However, this CD just seems like a money grab. Nothing really stands out, and there's no uniqueness to any of the songs; Anthrax didn't really add anything to make it \\"theirs\\"...I don't know...maybe I'm just being critical of a band I love...But I doubt I'll be buying Anthems 2 if they put one out...
0765325950|3.0|...or Robert Jordan. It had been said that Jim wrote the final chapter himself before he died, and I was looking forward to reading his writing again, Brandon Sanderson was given a difficult task in completing the series but he is not the master of the world that Jim created, nor does he have the depth that Jim had. It was saddening to contemplate what the last three books would have been had Jim lived to complete them. I missed Jim Wrigley, the man, as I read the disappointing conclusion to a wonderful creation.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really can't believe that this book was just as great, if not better then the first! It's not often you find a series this good. Can't wait to read the next book in the series!
B005HEPIDS|4.0|Star Trek: Voyager will never be remembered as the best of the Star Trek family, but it's still a very good sort of series, with likeable, relatable, characters that were difficult to say goodbye to. The Captain I could take or leave, but Paris and Kim, Tuvok, Chikote and Seven, the Doctor and Bellana were old friends by the time they said goodbye. The show returned the Star Trek franchise to its roots of exploration and encountering the unknown. As good as TNG and DSN were, their shared weakness was confinement to a smaller neighborhood. ST:V deserves recognition for its unique contribution to the fabric of this universe's story.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|IT IS AWESOME,COMPLETELY AWESOME!You get to build stuff &amp; the levels go up to fifty! Best game ever! COMPLETELY AWESOME!
B009X012XM|5.0|I'm very happy with this case.  I was using a leather case and found it heavy and bulky.  It did not fit in my bags and I<br />had to carry a tote along with my bag.  This fits comfortably wherever I put it and it's lightweight.  I'd recommend it.

1400156335|4.0|make sure you have a boombox that says it can play mp3's if you plan on listening to it that way.  it will not work for every boombox or cd player.  if you have one of the more recently made dvd players that can read all sorts of formats, then this will probably work- you can listen to the audio from you tv speaker and scoll through the chapters display on the screen.  you can also rip the file and transfer it into any digital memory player (apple, android, even just a usb flash drive)

B008XNZMOU|3.0|i have heard taylor swift sing on the radio and was hoping this record would be music i would like.  it is not and i was disappointed when i listened to it.  she is very popular, but i don't think her singing is really that good.  this is only my opinion and i'm sure there are people who do enjoy listening to her sing.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This had potential to be a good movie, but the language used by the adults and the children was so  crude!  I don' believe there is an American Family out there like this, if there is .....America is in bigger trouble than I thought! Why do producers think we want to hear this disrespectful trash???

Love, in partitcular, playing in different countrues.  That helps with boredoom. This game will work with small children.  They'll watch and ask questions.  The next they'll. Be ready to play some of the game. So imq off to start again,..maybe my new Kindle won't die on me this time around.
1593083246|5.0|I read this book at 14 years old and I LOVED it! I probably consider it to be my favorite book. The characters are so complex and the plot really draws you in once you get into it. A Must-Read!
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Very nice visuals, but the game is annoying when the particular layout is so restrictive it runs out of moves every turn ... and it's also annoying that when it does, it says &#34;no more move&#34; instead of moves.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|I like how the story was continued, though it started with tragedy.  I liked that the movie showed a more subdued hero than we usually see in a sword-and-sandal flick.  I also liked having a strong, yet not overly cliche female heroin to compliment the action.  I would have preferred that the ultimate villain not be so abstract; rather someone with more physical presence like Hades in the first movie.  It reminded me of &#34;Galactus&#34; in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, and whatever the heck that thing was in Green Lantern.  Much too vague to be compelling.  Still, the ending was rewarding despite how we got there, and the film overall was very enjoyable.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|AMAZING. Plot is wonderful, the characters engaging and fun to watch! The animation in this is beautiful and keeps you begging for more! I hope we get more vids with the back-story on the other chars!

B005MMJ84K|4.0|It kept me interested all the way ,I like the fact that the story was going back one forth in time .loved the finale !
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I am quite picky about movies. With that said, I found Django to be one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. It is easily my favorite movie from 2012.<br /><br />It's not easy for a 3 hour movie to keep your attention. When you are sad that it's over after 3 hours, that should tell you how entertaining it is. Not surprised that Tarantino won an Oscar for the screenplay. The characters are captivating, the dialogue is witty, and the story is hilarious, action-packed, and suspenseful.<br /><br />What I liked about it:<br />1) Classic Tarantino dialogue. Even if you are not always a Tarantino fan, you will be entertained, unless you are easily offended.<br />2) Acting is superb. Waltz had a spectacular performance as usual, and his Oscar was well deserved. Jamie Foxx, Leo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Samuel L Jackson, and all the supporting cast were great in their roles.<br />3) Screenplay and directing were pieces of art. Tarantino is one of the most talented writers and directors out there. There is no one else that does what he does with a pen and camera.<br /><br />What I didn't like about it:<br />Not much at all. Can't think of anything bad. Of course, this movie is not for young children.<br /><br />I preordered this on bluray/DVD as soon as I saw it on Amazon. It's a movie that I can't wait to watch again with friends.

B008CP6RWU|1.0|However, although it's advertised, my game did NOT come with a free month of Playstation Plus, and that really irks me. I'd write a thorough analysis and review of the game, but I'm quite busy at the moment.<br /><br />I do dislike being lied to however.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Good Book! Slow start, but story gets increasingly interesting and harder to put down until you just have to know!
B009JZWO3I|4.0|The only problem I had with this was the streaming. I might as well suffer through all the commercials. I don't know if it's an Amazon problem or a cable TV service problem. Whichever...it's annoying!<br />The series is great though.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I have enjoyed Vince Flynn's books since the first one about Mitch Rapp came out.  He's an awesome character and I often think that it's too bad he isn't real.  He makes no promises and apologizes later regarding his actions on persons of evil character and perilous to the United States.  If only....<br /><br />It's a fast read, too; it's interesting from the beginning.  I'm looking forward to Flynn's next book - with Mitch Rapp or without.  I like his writing style.

I haven't finished it yet and my Kindle deleted it and I have to start over, but honestly I don't mind. It's really fun. Would recommend it to anyone! It makes you think and use your brain to find out what to do next but not too much that it's frustrating. Everyone should at least try it. I know everyone is different so get the free version first, but I think you'll enjoy it : )

I was disappointed in the turn of events for some of my favorite characters, but others live on & the struggle continues.  For me, it's always difficult to wait for the next book to be written.  At least the series is back w/ Season 3 - even tho the books give you so much more detail & insight into the lives of each of the characters.  Waiting for Book 6!!

B0068RHGJM|3.0|I kept reading rave reviews of how great this album would be. When I first listened to it, I was very disappointed. With the exception of a few songs like Storytime, I Want My Tears Back, Last Ride Of The Day, Ghost River, and the first few minutes of Song Of Myself, this album was horrible. Nightwish is known as a symphonic metal band but some of the songs on the album would never be classified as such. For example, the song Slow, Love, Slow sounds like a song you'd hear in a Vegas lounge, not from a metal band. Nightwish tried, but failed to outdo Dark Passion Play.

0061122416|4.0|The Alchemist<br />Paulo Coelho<br />Hardcover<br />Publisher: Harper SanFrancisco<br />Publication Date: 1st edition - April 16, 1993<br />ISBN-13: 978-0062502179<br />192 pages<br /><br />  One fourth spiritual poetry, one fourth platitudes, one fourth desert myth, and one fourth the philosophy of decency The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is a study of life expressed as a myth or fable. It's the story of a young boy named Santiago who has the imagination and resolution to go out and search for his own \\"Personal Legend.\\" Santiago stumbles a time or two but finds a series of guides that serve as moral compasses throughout his adventures. In one way or another they push him toward his goals, help him to retain his courage, and assist him in correctly reading the life omens he encounters. His endeavors eventually lead him to understand his own heart and inner desires. In varying degrees The Alchemist reminded me of some of the great spiritual writings of the past. It is the ghost of Kahlil Gibran and Rumi speaking to us, and like its predecessors, The Alchemist embraces a number of incredibly important messages, lessons that have been told and re-told in literature countless times. However, that does not make this particular story any less valid (or enjoyable) then those that have come before it. While the graphic novel is, in my opinion, more impactful visually the novel left me filled with the desire to go out and fulfill my own \\"Personal Legend.\\" Where images were more visually enticing the novel became a more emotional experience. Both are, in my opinion, worth the time spent reading. Coelho successfully points out the emotional roller coaster encountered when something urgent is desired and how, for some, that desire often manifests its way in a universal realignment to point us in the direction of that goal. (Though many of us refuse to hear or follow that call.) Coelho explains how a true hunger and passion for something can, and often is, rewarded by success and that every one of us has a \\"Personal Legend\\" inside us waiting to \\"become\\" or to manifest itself in a way we can recognize. (Usually its not how we see it in our heads when we set our goals.) The story reminds us that those who love us encourage and inspire us in many ways to follow our dreams, to pursue our ambitions, and that how simply reaching for our goals will take us to places we could never have expected to go without taking that first step.<br /><br />  File with: Poetry, Spirituality, Parable, and damn fine literature!<br /><br />4 ½ stars out of 5<br /><br />The Alternative One<br />Southeast Wisconsinhat every one of us has a \\"Personal Legend\\" inside us waiting to \\"become\\" or to manifest itself in a way we can recognize.

Each of Santiago's guides are beautifully drawn (one in the likeness of Coelho himself)  and help enhance the lessons being taught. The Alchemist embraces a number of important messages, lessons that have been told and re-told in literature countless times. However, that does not make this particular story any less valid (or enjoyable) then those that have come before it. In fact, the art enhances every aspect of the story. As a matter of fact, the story depicted in graphic novel form tells the story better, I think, than the novel. Where a thousand words might suffice in fiction, ten words and an image need to deliver the same message graphically. That paring down helps highlight the many morals the protagonist encounters in his journey. Coelho points out the emotions encountered when something urgent is desired and how, for some, that need often manifests its way in a universal realignment to point us in the direction of that goal.

0385536828|2.0|The premise for this sounded basically like Ian McEwan writing a John le Carre novel.  Of course I should have realized that such a thing would be beneath McEwan.  Instead this is a fairly turgid novel of what's pretty much an academic scandal.  The stakes of it are set so low that even with the twist at the end reminiscent of McEwan's great Atonement I just didn't care.<br /><br />McEwan spends the first 1/4 or so of the novel sabotaging his narrator.  He makes Serena Frome (pronounced to rhyme with Plume) sound like such a silly airhead that there's no reason for me to care what becomes of her.  She was good at math, but when pushed into college math finds she's far too dull to compete with the boys.  Her reading comprehension skills are equally dull so that while she might read lots of books she fails to understand most of them.  Thanks to an affair with an older man she gets signed up as a low-level go-fer at MI5.<br /><br />There she gets involved with the eponymous Sweet Tooth program.  This is a program to covertly sponsor various writers in the hope they'll churn out anti-Soviet material.  Serena gets assigned to a guy named Tom Healy, a pretentious academic whose greatest success is writing a short novel that seems to be a copy of Cormac McCarthy's The Road.<br /><br />Again there's a twist at the end, but it was so unimportant that I didn't care.  When McEwan did it in Atonement it was much better because the stakes were literally life and death.  In this case it's more of a \\"Gotcha!\\" surprise that's echoed in some of Tom's stories like the one narrated about a talking ape.  Serena is pretty much the talking ape in this case.  As if she weren't already a dull enough character enough now we have to question her very existence!<br /><br />Anyway, unless you're a serious Anglophile familiar with what happened in Britain in the early 70s I don't see any reason to waste time with this.<br /><br />That is all.

B0051QIGP4|3.0|I really liked Lady Gaga's first album and had high hopes for her second album.  The album is kind of lack luster besides the few singles they play on the radio.  I don't really listen to this album even though it's on my iPhone.  The only reason I purchased the album was because amazon was pretty much giving it away for $1, how could I pass that up?  Definitely would not have payed full price.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love the series.  The second season is even better than the first. My daughters are watching it now and are enjoying it just as much. I would recommend it to anyone.

B004GUSG4M|5.0|Christine wakes up everyday not knowing who she is.  She is horrified to find that she is 20 years older than she expected.  Who is that person in the mirror?  She has a husband, Ben, who takes care of her.  She begins to see a psychiatrist who tells her to keep a journal and write in it every day.  He calls her each morning after Ben has gone to work to tell her where the journal is hidden in the closet and, as a result, she begins to piece her life together - what it was before and people who are no longer in her life.  As an amnesiac, Christine trusts no one, not even herself.  Does she really remember something or is it something she imagined?  She reads her journal every day to remember things and events such as the mysterious accident that put her in a hospital and a nursing home for years before being released to Ben.  I don't remember how she began seeing the doctor and if it was explained in the beginning of the story but he was instrumental in her explorations and her finding herself.  I don't want to spoil the story in any way for you.  I can only say that it was so moving and touching that it is a story that I will remember every day for the rest of my life.  It left me feeling grateful for my personal strengths and the loving people that I have in my life and also how fragile we all are.<br /><br />I am astounded to discover that this is the author's first novel.  It is impressive!  I've been telling my husband and best friend about this novel and I know my husband will soon read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its the best game because you never know when you're going to die and you could go as far as you can but some people just don't know it and it's fun to play with friends because you never know when you're going to beat them.

B00030EIXW|5.0|Probably the best performance of Beethoven's fifth and seventh symphonies in the past century. At least the best I've ever heard. And Kleiber is one of the best conductors of what we know. What a pity that Kleiber had so few appearances.

0140157352|5.0|In this easy-to-read book, authors Roger Fisher and William Ury provide underlying theory, as well as concrete examples on how to improve your negotiation skills.  They cover the full ground from bargaining for antiques to getting a better salary to international peace treaty.  No topic is too small or too big.  Thus, the principles in this book can help you in all aspects of life.<br /><br />Fisher and Ury show us how to use \\"Principled Negotiation\\" to achieve a better outcome.  They start by describing how positional arguments (they usual behavior) locks both our opponent and ourselves into a corner that it is both hard to emerge from and hard to reach agreement on.  In contrast, using creativity and starting from each person's principles, we are able to find solutions that help both parties.  For example, in the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, Egypt wanted the Sinai back, and Israel wanted security.  Peace could be achieved by finding the true needs rather than starting with ultimatums.<br /><br />Of course, not all parties will be trained, or even initially willing to use the \\"Principled Negotiation\\" approach.  Authors show how you can deal with the other party's intransigence or even dirty tricks, to turn the negotiation back to principles rather than personal attacks.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0140157352 Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In]] is a fantastic introduction to Principled Negotiation and can help you achieve what you want in many different situations.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book. I think it was even better than the first. Loved the story line and what the author has done with it. Even fifty  is surprised and scalable and God love Grace at the end when the affair came out.hope the last one is just as good.
1416550518|4.0|While a movie is being about a pivotal event in 98 year old Grace's life, she remembers the events as they happened to her when she was a teenager, working as a maid at Riverton House. The story of what happened on a mysterious night when a young poet is compelling. Equally compelling is Grace's relationship with young sisters Hannah and Emmeline. Recommended for fans of historical drama along the lines of Downton Abbey.
B007PVHANM|1.0|Dear Sirs,<br /><br />With great regret I have to confirm that even after returning the first copy of Marley that I received (as non-playable!) - I received a replacement Marley DVD that I, again, had to return as unplayable.  I have, before making this order for Marley, very recently updated my dvd player, and all dvd's run very well on my new system - so, the fault is with the actual Marley DVD!!!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Toby Gower
1609419693|2.0|Rather disappointing.  It seems that Ms. Fey wrote the book &#34;on the fly&#34; and did not put in the time necessary for a well constructed and full book which would exclude extensive pages of the more boring parts of her early life life.

This game always cheers me up when I'm bored or need to pass the time.I also love the graphics and that it changes location every once in a while.I only give it 4 stars because it's lack of personality and I think it could use something special

048623231X|5.0|I have been familiar with Dore's work since childhood, when my mother purchased a copy of Dore's Rime of the Anchient Mariner.  I think the engraving copies of both works are superb and enjoy viewing them in relation to the stories they represent.  I had no idea that dore had so many other engravings until I came across them on Amazon.  Great art in reasonable form.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game because, the scores that i receive are phenomenal, without me even knowing it. One thing that irks me is, when you die,and start a new game, it's so slow!

B004PHE9F6|5.0|This is a work of fiction and not a document, but it works as both. As a fan of vintage racing, this film works as a great time capsule witrh all the legendary drivers and circuits depicted. Just plain fantastic footage, taste use of  the split screen by Frankenheimer, great convincing work by garner who did his own driving and gained the respect of the pros. Gorgeous cars. They were really hot-rodded F3 cars with big tires but they looked and sounded like the F1 cars of the day.  The transfer is great, with appropriate, pleasing amount of grain and color. Great sound. Nice extras.  A feast for the eyes and ears. Get this thing now.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|The 3570k is one FAST CPU. And it's highly overclockable. I have my 3570k at 4.5Ghz right now and with this overclock I'm normally faster than a 3770k in most benchmarks, even multithreaded ones. And I'm a whole lot faster in single threaded benchmarks.<br /><br />The reason I love the 3570k is because it's the most powerful CPU, per core, on the market. Meaning one of a 3570k's cores are just as powerful, if not more, than any other CPU on the market. The 3570k is even faster than a 3970x if your only using one core.<br /><br />So in single-threaded programs, or programs that use 4 cores or less, and a lot of programs and 99.99% of games use 4 cores or less, this CPU will perform better than ANY other. The only time a 3570k's performance is less than a 3770k or 3970x, is when you start to use 5+ cores. Like in rendering and things of that nature. But even with rendering and multithreaded applications the 3570k is no slouch. In fact, a 3770k only gives you about a 20-40% performance gain, but only while using all 8 threads. 40% may seem like a lot but that's the absolute maximum it can be. On average the performance gain is around 25%.<br /><br />This is exactly why I love this processor. For people like me who only game and surf the internet and use iTunes and do all the normal things people do, your processor absolutely can't get any faster than this 3570k can. That's just a fact. And for only around 200$ you can't beat the price/performance ratio. Sometimes it can be worth going with the 3770k, or 3930k, or 3970x, but for me, I wouldn't see any performance improvement with any of those. Sometimes I could actually see less, since the 3930k and 3970x are Sandy Bridge processors that aren't as powerful per core as the 3570k.<br /><br />My advice is to buy this CPU. You can't get any better of a CPU for all of your day to day tasks. Especially gaming, this thing is beastly. Before I got this CPU I was thinking if I should spend the extra 100$ on the 3770k and I wondered if it would be worth it. And for what I do, it's not worth one penny more. In fact, nothing I do on a daily basis would be faster on a 3770k than a 3570k. The 3770k may make sense for some people, but for most, the 3570k is THE way to go.
B000VECAC6|5.0|If this is not the most hilarious movie ever it's because the Python's earlier medieval offering probably gets that title; but it's a close call. What a romp. If you've never seen anything by the Pythons you will still have a great time and probably recognize John Cleese.  If you don't like this movie you probably don't belong in the human race.<br />Great transfer. Good image, good sound.  Blueray has been a boon for old movies, they look as they were meant to be seen at the theater. The modern ones look too sharp and you can see people's pores and nose hairs. In old movies they looks just dandy because the focus is softer.  Get this, it's cheap.

B0040QYROK|5.0|Incredibly sharp clear image, lots of new recovered footage  (very battered but also totally watchable) and great original score. This is a must have, great packaging.  Nice extras about the museum in Argentina that had the missing footage. Now only 5 minutes left for a complete cut.  Meanwhile, this edition will knock you back and stomp on your face with the clarity and beauty of the transfer.

B000MV90IU|5.0|If you don't know Steve McQueen why are you on Earth? The movie is moody and slow but in a good way.  At least until that chase scene erupts on your screen. See the five hubcaps, the recurring Volkswagen and all the goofs narrated in the commentary. Great SanFran time capsule. Nice transfer. The film is grainy but in a good way. Nice extras too. Worthwhile disc in every way.
B001992NW4|5.0|'The Exorcist' (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) Blu-ray with Blu-ray Book packaging is one of the best collector's editions I have ever owned. The package itself is simple, it is a hardcover book-like case complete with both discs and with several pages of editorials and nerd-goodies.<br />As soon as I opened it I was caught off guard with a little note written by William Friedkin telling the story of how he came to direct this masterpiece. It is written on a separate sheet of paper not attached to the book itself.<br />The Blu-ray transfer is gorgeous, done personally by Friedkin and cinematographer Owen Roizman.<br />For any fan of this film or film and general this is worth the $45 that it cost. Jump on it before it's gone.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A light, humorous story about a very smart man whose adventures throughout his life take the reader through twists and turns.

B0099Y2MYK|3.0|The program itself is wonderful, but there was a bad spot on one of the CDs that caused the program to skip and freeze.  We had to start that CD completely over.  The second time through, it still froze a couple of times (basically in the same ten minutes of the production) but at least it did finally move forward.  We figured it was a defective CD.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I got this book after a friend recommended it to me. It's important to note that she made the recommendation BEFORE we got married. I didn't pay her too much mind then. After two years of marriage I started to notice some changes. Our marriage wasn't heading for the rocks or anything like that but I had a desire in me to improve. To be a better wife to my husband. This book has helped me to better understand my husband. I thought I knew his love language (words of affirmation) but I was WAY off. We both took the profiles provided in the book. I learned that his love language is Acts of Service. My goal now is use this new knowledge to be a better wife to him. I also learned that I was bilingual in my love languages, I didn't think that was possible. Overall it was a great and informative read.

B004EPZ0AC|3.0|I've got to admit, the first Happy Feet took me by surprise.  Penguins- been there done that.  Musicals- been there, don't need to do that again.  Environmentalism agendas - am there, hate that!  Yet still the film left me surprised for its ability to tell a moving, charming tale of the interaction between humanity and nature.  The characters were easy to care about; the tension was real and the pacing was flawless.  Naturally when I heard a sequel had been made in 2011 that featured a majority of the same vocal talent (with some powerhouse additions), had $130-million budged (up $30-mil over the first one) and was again written & directed by George Miller, I was naturally interested in continuing with the tale.<br /><br />I suppose I should start with the good news: This isn't a copy/paste rehash of the first film.  The bad news: This isn't a copy/paste rehash of the first film.  While it's true this one probably looked decent on paper (swooping panoramic shots of masses of dancing penguins, near photo-realistic textures and animal models, a new secondary story thread following a pair of existentially obsessed krill and so on), the problem this time around has everything to do with pacing and plot structure but more on that in a bit.<br /><br />The film comes in at a runtime of 100-minutes and wears a PG rating for some animated hijinks, little tension and mild rude humor.  The cast is pretty tight again (though slightly different this time around): Elijah Wood returns as Mumble, P!nk replaces the late Brittany Murphy as Gloria, Robin Williams is back pulling double duty as Ramon/ Lovelace, and Hugo Weaving returns as the village elder.  Mumble's parents (Memphis played by Hugh Jackman and Norma Jean/ Nicole Kidman) are nowhere to be found this time but Brad Pitt and Matt Damon were brought on board as Will and Bill the Krill respectively.<br /><br />The story, or what passes for one here, opens with our main couple having birthed a young penguin named Erik, who, like his father before him, doesn't seem to have the natural gift for singing.  Unlike his pops, however, Erik lacks to rhythm to tap dance his way into hero-status.  Faced with childhood humiliation and parental crises of a confidence-less kid, the story begins to look a little predictable.<br /><br />However things quickly take a turn for the bizarre when little Erik and his pals venture off to the neighboring community of Adelie penguins where they encounter The Mighty Sven, a Tufted Puffin (bird) apparently mistaken as a flying penguin by the Adelies.  Dispensing generic advice by the boatload through a bit of an over-the-top accent by Hank Azaria, Sven becomes Erik's new role model (not to mention convinces many a penguin that the ability to fly is simply a matter of believing in themselves).  Amidst all this we follow two krill who leave the safety and security of the only swarm they've ever known to discover the vast world beyond.<br /><br />Long story short- Erik discovers that even though he can't dance or fly, he can achieve greatness by believing in himself right? Wrong!  The real core of the story here works off the premise that a massive iceberg crashes into the ice floe home of the emperor penguins, trapping the lot of them in a valley.  This time the story is a rescue operation rather than a tale of character growth; and there's nothing wrong with that when done correctly.<br /><br />The trouble here is the pacing is pretty messy.  Disasters just keep unfolding out of nowhere only to be overcome just in time for the next one.  Never is there a sense of a strong backstory or valuable lesson present so much as a successive collection of sweeping scenes.  The singing/ dancing element is certainly more stale (and overused) this time around as well.<br /><br />The environmentalist cues oft-complained about in the first film are back, though admittedly not quite so \\"in your face\\" as say Lovelace with a 6-pack holder cutting off his oxygen, prepare for a fairshare of global warming references, segments of oil spills and even some odd live-footage splices of turkeys being stuffed and chickens rotating on a rotisserie.  However, and to the film's credit, they do try to redeem mankind by depicting us as trying to help build a way out for the stranded penguins as well as cleaning up the oil-soaked animals.<br /><br />In all, Happy Feet Two meanders around and pokes at some pretty interesting concepts but never really flushes any of them out by the film's conclusion.  Perhaps its biggest crime however happens to be that it never establishes the type of connection that makes you really concerned for the characters.  Watchable for sure, and kids will likely be entertained by the beautiful visuals and dancing, but it's the nuances adults will notice that keep it from filling the happy shoes of the original.share of global warming references, segments of oil spills and even some odd live-footage splices of turkeys being stuffed and chickens rotating on a rotisserie.

140131046X|5.0|This is a book about religion and tolerance and having faith. It's written by a man who I consider to be one of the best writers living today. It's meant to evoke emotion and make the reader take a step back and consider themselves, especially their beliefs, values, and relationships.<br /><br />It's a good book for anyone of any religious belief or no religious belief or questioning religious belief. It is not a book that tries to impose anything on the reader. It's a non-fiction compilation of things that the author learned about and from two religious figures in his life, and the extension of those influences throughout his life.<br /><br />Have a Little Faith is extremely moving. I cried several times during many parts of the story and was genuinely inspired by many parts as well. It has many applicable quotes and messages of wisdom for readers today, completely regardless of what religion the reader is or is not. This book is a learning experience written in a powerful but relatively short manner, but every word is important and it is definitely a book that was created for a purpose. It is innocuous but powerful; if it were possible for everyone in the world to sit down and read this book together, we would all surely come out with a lot more understanding of one another and a lot more respect for others and ourselves, and the differences that distinguish us and cause conflict.<br /><br />It's really one of the best books I have ever read, and I think about it often when I feel unsure about myself or feel like I need to be more steadfast in my beliefs or more considerate of others'. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, ever, and I truly think that reading this book changes the reader for the better.

B008NMT684|1.0|When you attempt to purchase the upgrade it does not upgrade but you get charged anyway. Waste of time and money.
B00435WX7G|5.0|Beautiful Model and my GF loved it.<br /><br />took me about 10 hours to assemble the main model at which most of the time spend on &#34;Not&#34; building them,<br /><br />but scratching off the extra plastic when pulling parts from the base.<br /><br />and some stickers does not fit &#34;perfectly&#34;<br /><br />good product overall.
B002TWWOHE|4.0|Since I'm paying for two other shows this one is not as good.<br />It's a fun show to watch not too serious plus he's good looking.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|I read this book twenty years ago. It was very inspiring then and It is just as inspiring now. I highly recommend. Betty does a great job giving hope for all people that heaven is real.
B008EKOO46|4.0|As somebody who's worked in PNG for 19 years I can vouch for the tales Jared has put in this book.  In fact, I suspect he may have spared the reader some of the more lurid tales from that country.<br />He's right on the money when he says that people in PNG welcome civilisation.  The place has been regressing back into a lawless stateless situation ever since the Australians left more so in the country than the city, and I constantly get &#34;em i gutpela long taim bipor&#34; (it was good when the Australians were in charge). Rural areas are a free for all now and it's not good, no hospitals or aid posts, schools run down and criminals running riot.<br />It may seem like it maybe travels a little too fast over some topics, but it can't be everything to everybody.<br />I like the last part of the book, it mirrors things I've been thinking about, aging parents and all that.  That being said, having been around village life for quite a while it's a real relief going back to my nuclear home knowing I can shut the door and get some peace and quiet.

B008JGSM6G|3.0|Fun game but I would have rather paid a few dollars to get an ad free version.  I won't let my child play with it becuase of the ads that popup.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I got sucked into watching and am so glad I did.  Crazy, creepy fun.  Good stories and great acting. Feature film quality show.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Easily one of the best films ever made, LOA is now also one of the best blu-rays. A frighteningly clean transfer makes this look like it was made yesterday---except no one makes movies this sprawlingly epic any more (except in CGI, which is another animal altogether).<br /><br />Two discs for nine clams is a gift, truly. Endless extras, most of them well made, show how many people are devotees of this masterpiece. Spielberg's bit is quite nice. The wonderful score sounds gorgeous in surround. But it's how good the film looks that is the real highlight here.<br /><br />I never even bothered to see this on dvd, as it demands a large screen. But I couldn't resist giving the blu-ray a gander on a large LCD screen, and am thrilled I did. While the massive shots will never really be done justice on a non-theater screen, they nonetheless look fabulous here. The blue skies are among the purest I've ever seen on a home screen, and the endless vistas still look literally awesome. It still astonishes that this was O'Toole's screen debut, and his performance is as magnificent as ever. Sharif and Quinn et al match him step for step; few films have this many stellar turns.<br /><br />But this is after all Lean's film, and a case could be made that no film has ever been directed more flawlessly. Just look at all the extras in some of those scenes; how did he make it all work? Still seems near impossible. Over 3.5 hours, it demands patience and thought, two things most filmgoers tend to want to avoid. But if you put in the time and open your mind along with your eyes, you will walk away changed by Lawrence Of Arabia. The superb script is brought to life by Lean's amazing framing and composition skills, and he sure know how to draw the best from his actors. The interviews show that everyone knew how good this was going to be from day one, and the actors sure loved Lean.<br /><br />As they should. Few of them ever matched their heights here again. If you've never seen this, I still say you should wait and see it on a big screen first. No flat screen can ever match a real 70 mm print, and being swallowed by the desert is part of LOA's majesty. But if you've got no art house cinema playing oldies in your town, then by all means grab this blu-ray. It's one of the best yet made, and it sure is nice to be able to lay on the sofa drinking a cold brew as Lawrence and his camels plod across the endless deserts. The almost total lack of grain in the picture is astonishing; the only grain left are the trillions of grains of sand, and you can almost pick them out single in some shots. They may have reworked this in remastering.processing, but it was done with taste and precision. This is one of the best BD restorations to date that I've seen.<br /><br />This film deserved this level of transfer, and thanks to those who made it happen. What a treat to be able to watch this at leisure any time you desire, in cinema quality. They don't make 'em like this any more, and never will.ay you should wait and see it on a big screen first.

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I watched it 3 times now! Yes this is a fantastic Walt Disney flick! The story is cool the animation is great the characters will take you back in time to the 80's yes its that great! Now I can only pray for a sequel in 2015!! I bought it on Blu-ray because<br />of the picture quality versus DVD you do see it! This is a must have for the entire family as well they will Love it! =)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it keeps me occupied for hours. Works great on kindle fire hd. Please get this game.You will enjoy it so much.
B000XKZQ74|5.0|What a great movie for HS students to understand how our great country is and what a Socialist state does to it's people. Witnessed here in Germany, but repeated in China and Russia etc.<br />We really have to be careful and not allow our leaders to continue down this path.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Love the game but saying there is a update get to the store no update its been three days now I need my fix
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This season is good. I thought they got a little too carried away with the burning fire room. But our family adores this show!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story line pulled me in and did'nt disappoint. All the hype about the fifty shades series did not include the fact that the story line was good.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|If you're interested in Jane Austen read the original works instead. This book reads like a script for a movie.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|This was the book club read for April.  It took me 4 weeks to read one third of the book.  It normally takes me two to three days to read a book.  Had to force myself to read that much.  I will not finish this book!!!!!
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I love how original this is.  It's a great film that was enjoyed by every member of our family from  1 to 30.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It wasn't just about sex.  There is a great story line.  I would reccomend it to all my friends.  I will probably read the series again next year.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I've had this DVD for years, and am just now (quite tardily) getting around to writing this review. I will say that I am a HUGE Jillian fan, and bought and mainly used this DVD when I was first starting to get into shape. I think it is a great workout for beginners. The 3-2-1 system (strength, cardio, and abs) is very time effective and makes the workout flow well. It seems shorter than it is, and it's already short. If you are an intermediate or advanced exerciser though, this probably really isn't for you. I still occasionally use this if I want a quick workout, but it is not really difficult for me anymore at all. For someone just getting into working out, it's perfect.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love books that keep me from the hum drum of housework.  Didn't want to do anything but read this book.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I was a little hesitant at buying these books for my kindle because I'd heard it had some disturbing parts in it. While it did have a few disturbing parts, I am truly glad I read this. It's one of the more intriguing and creative stories I've read in a long time.<br />The first book revolves around Mikael Blomkvist and his attempt to solve the mystery of Harriet Vanger's disappearance. He later teams up with Lisbeth Salander, an anti-social, extremely talented young woman who becomes the main focus of the next two books. Both Mikael and Lisbeth are great characters whom I wanted to learn more about throughout the books. One of the reasons these books held my interests is the character of Lisbeth Salander. Lisbeth is very different from most protagonists you're going to find in a novel. She isn't exactly a pleasant character and yet the reader is compelled to learn more about her to understand why she is the way she is.<br />All three stories are very interesting and it was hard for me to put them down. One criticism I did have though was that the beginnings of both the first and second books were pretty slow. It does take a while for the first two books to get interesting, but the pay off was definitely worth it. I would encourage anyone who was having problems getting into the first book to try and get past the first few chapters. The book gets a lot better after that, in my opinion.<br />One of the themes of these books is violence and mistreatment of women, which does lead to a few very disturbing scenes. Those scenes are certainly not for the faint of heart. That being said, I would still recommend reading these books. I would compare the series to 'Game of Thrones' in the sense that I haven't read anything quite like this before and the characters are not your typical generic fare. Their motivations and actions are fleshed out well, giving the reader an understanding of the characters even if you don't agree/like them.<br />Overall, I'm really glad I bought this. It was a good break from the generic and stale stories that I've been reading recently.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Cubistry is a good game for seniors.  It challenges the eye-hand coordination.  Much of us in our senior years  need games like this to sharpen our minds and use our hands.  I like this game.  Shir
B001AQO3QA|5.0|to all fans of this franchise: buy it confidently!<br /><br />just make sure you either have a region free player or region A player if you buy non international version.<br />don't know why, but on Amzon is advertised as being all regions, while in fact it is only for region A.<br />maybe they will fix this, so that people do not get mislead.

0307346617|5.0|If you are a fan of the survivalist/zombie genre you need to read this book.  Max Brooks writes in a very readable and straight forward manner, but it is still very descriptive and gripping. This book was addicting.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|After reading colleens novel hopeless I have been dying to get my hands on something else she's written! This book is so different from any other novel you have ever read in all the right ways. The poetry that the characters use are so inspiring and thought provoking. The connection between lake and will is so much stronger than infatuation And so very deep. May I add that this was The first book I have EVER highlighted dialogues!!!! Loved it would recommend it to anyone.

B008JFUNPK|5.0|My 7 yr old daughter took mom & Grandma to see this when it came out. She was so excited and it did not disappoint any of us. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It delivered a wonderful message for everyone! Now if only someone can come up with grown up movies that are original, excellent quality all around, heartfelt, and that stick with you & make you think long after you leave the theater, that's what we'd gladly spend our hard earned money to go and see. Keep these kinds of movies up, please :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really cool and its fun to play when your bourd. There's nothing even more fun unless you hate this game.
B00BJS7104|5.0|Listen, enough comentary on this movie. You need to sit down and watch the whole movie unenterupted. That means shutting up those kids. Nuff said.

B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|Linkin park will most likely never return to there signature nu metal sound, unfortunately it is very much a dead genre. That going forward Living Things has many good tracks on it and I think it makes a solid addition to their past albums.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|it is very nice the 3-d effects are very good and I feel if you can't get to the grand canyon get this.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|i loved the first three books in the series...couldn't put them down and looked forward to books four and five...four left the storyline and bactracked and five wasn't much better as it didn't end the series nor tie up enough ends so that this reader felt satisfied...that said i will probably buy the next book if and when there is one to see what happens
B004HW7JMY|5.0|The blood might be to much to some people but to me I loved this series.  Wish it was going past 3 seasons.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|i love philippa gregory and was not disappointed at all in this book...she makes everything so real and one is immediately caught up in her story...fabulous writing... once again a winner!!!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I can watch this movie wherever I want by having multiple copies.  And, yes, I will be watching this again and again because I want to know that I have noticed all of the video game nods!
B004LX0D36|5.0|Everything by Jane Austen is wonderful. It's just  too  bad there is so little. This early work is very sweet, and of course everyone learns to appreciate Eleanor.
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|This new album have a taste of forgotten dreams, a little bitter, a little tender. One of the best Nick Cave's works and certainly one of the best albums of the year, maybe one of the best of all times!
0071373586|5.0|This case-study-lite presentation of positioning was more enjoyable to read than a college-text alternative. Since its publishing, some of the terms used in the book have been replaced by new buzzwords, so don't quote the book, but do learn the lessons of positioning.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Any plans to update the users that purchased the app?  That was the point of paying for the app. Still waiting. . .
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I give it 5 stars because of the quality of the film over all and its story telling.<br /><br />Wes Anderson has a very unique style that for some, could be hard to get.  The cast in this film is just plain amazing and really bring it to life in this touching tale of two kids falling in love and all the dysfunctional adults trying to put an end to their dream life.  There is a strange feeling that the very unreal characters are so very real.  The film suspends you in a state of unreality that just allows you to let go while watching and kind of forget how uninteresting our own lives can be while you follow these very obscure people down their rabbit holes.<br /><br />Overall,  touching, sad, raw, and hilariously sarcastic tones permeate the movie.  The characters are so quirky but believable that you find yourself saying &#34;did they really just say that?&#34;<br /><br />Once again,<br />Bravo Wes Anderson
0425264351|4.0|I am collecting this series of books. I found ones I had missed on this site.Will use this site again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is fun and it gives me something to do. When I start playing, I don't stop unless I have to. If you get this game, your smart.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Not really sure what the game is all about but didn't seem too violent for my 10 year old grand son. He spent many hours playing it while visiting for Easter break. He did't seem to lose interest so for me it was a good pick
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing I really like the style of it. But sometimes it can be frustrating. Like when I'm trying to download the new tour to be in it won't let me do it. But it takes me a little bit to figure it out but mostly is is really fun. It's great for kids. I luv this game plus its free!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|If you turn off the wi-fi you will not get all the annoying ads. I don't know why I didn't think of this before.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE IT! My son and I LOVE to play this game and he just cracks up when he hears the smack sound when the man hits the train.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Yeah, it was a silly realization when i thought of it. There is some manner of strategy involved, but youre still at the mercy of random rolls, and matching symbols hoping you get the right one. But drop in the Cthulhu theme and it's fun as all get out. A video game version of the Arkham Horror board game, i played it on my friends ipad for a few hours and was hooked. i immediately snagged a copy for my kindle once i realized it was available. Good way to burn a couple hours once you get sick of reading. If you get sick of reading... or you just get the urge to be devoured by an Old One.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think that this book is the best book I ever read and I can't wait to read Catching Fire!!!!!
1476734941|4.0|I thought the book was well written and had all the information I needed to start the program. I'm into my third week with no hunger problems and have lost a few pounds already, but not off the little pot belly that I want to lose. Ill stick with it and see what happens.
B0033807C2|5.0|It is a awesome book if any one who doesn't like it is crazy.I read like crazy.percy Jackson books rule.
B00447L4JG|5.0|I think I have watched this movie a hundred times since I purchased. Received it in great timing and was shipped almost instantly!<br /><br />Thanks
B008I43DYU|5.0|I have needed a good calculator one that i could see!I can carry it every where I go along with the camera and video camera. I am in love with it!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|More fun and better graphics than the other games I've played. The story is interesting too. Plus you get a little helper monkey. Everyone loves cute little helper monkeys.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I have been taking pictures all day! These pictures are very clear I couldn't ask for better! Now I can't get my daughter off of it!
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Great music for galleries and projects.<br />I am looking forward to more music from this company.<br />Thank you so much!
0143121006|4.0|My only (small) gripe is that I just can't believe so much detail is available about these events.  On the one hand, the investigation was primitive and handled poorly. But on the other, if someone was wearing a tie with a loose thread, this was noted somewhere.  It's interesting of course, but you could research a crime from last month and not get all this minutiae.  A little hard to believe.  Do we really know if some guy had one brandy or two on a certain night, close to a century ago?  As fiction, it's perfect.  As non-fiction it's well reasoned but doesn't quite ring true.
B006YC74E8|2.0|It didn't work on my kindle fire so I uninstalled it. Maybe better instructions would make it easier to use.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book.  I'm a fan of space exploration and of science fiction.<br /><br />The details about the Mars mission and the events throughout the book were<br />very believable to me (as a layman) - I didn't have any disbelief to suspend.<br /><br />The main character cracked me up - I had a great time reading his adventures,<br />laughing out loud in many places even though the situation was often quite<br />tense.<br /><br />Great read!
B0097HSS4M|2.0|It would not work on my kindle fire so I uninstalled it. Maybe better instructions on how to use it.
B00817RYCG|5.0|I've probably read Catch-22 ten times.  I've taught it at the college level.  I frequently gifted it and I've talked about to anyone who will pretend to listen.<br /><br />It was good when I first read it and it's gotten better with each subsequent read.  There's so much here, it's almost mindboggling to think how Heller wrote this without the aid of spreadsheets and computers.  Oh, the migraines it must've brought on.<br /><br />Ex-PFC Wintergreen. Dunbar.  Milo the Mayor.  Just writing this review makes me want to read it again.<br /><br />The opening lines brilliantly represent the book's tone throughout.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I will recommend this book to everyone I know. It is well written and gives an excellent perspective of what modern warfare is like.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|The court room drama reminds me of Boston Legal.  The good wife is easy to like.  Each episode comes with its surprises.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Lame. Why pay to get weather reports when you can get it for free on tv. Not to mention most the time you are connected to internet, you are probably at home. Plus its so plain. Not even worth the dollar.
B0067R0APK|4.0|This is a slick new look. Bit of a learning curve, bur manageable. Has some great new features along with all the old ones. Easier to keep track of multiple locations. I would regimens it.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|With the winter quarter being over I now have the chance to complete this book but I've only read about 4 chapters so I'm pretty sure when I finish it I can rate it a higher rating.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Just keeps getting better and better! Plots and scripts are intriguing. Some were even quite emotional. Acting is exceptional! So believable!
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Thank you for this it completes my series and it's the end of an era for me, I finally get to watch them whenever I want to
1455502758|5.0|Interesting not for seeing an atheist facing death (we know he would stay an atheist), but for anyone facing treatment choices with a terminal illness.  Is all the suffering worth a bit more time? Does our medical system not know when to quit with the life extending practices, or how to tell patients what they realistically may face?
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|First off let me say that I freaking love old school horror flicks and psychological thrillers.  I cut my teeth on the original Friday the 13th, Halloween, Prom Night, Terror Train and Fright Night.  The mark of a good scary movie, for me, is the scare-the-crap-out-of-me story line and not a gore fest where you can see the victim's entrails.  With that in mind, this movie is by far the scariest movie I have seen in years.  Damn!  I finished watching this movie an hour ago and I still don't think my heart rate has gone down to normal levels yet.  Without giving away too many spoilers I will detail the awesomeness:<br /><br />-Move into a house where a murder (or murders as the case may be) happened<br />-Find a box of creepy old super 8 movies<br />-Watch said movies over and over again in a dark room while drinking copious amounts of liquor<br />-Ignore your kids creepy and disturbing new actions<br />-Add the supernatural factor in<br />-Add a compelling mystery that spans 40 years and you are the first one to make the connection<br />-Include lots of visual scares that cause your viewers (well me at least) to let our blood curdling screams that make your husband afraid the neighbors will call the cops because it sounds like you are being murdered<br />-Good surprise ending that I didn't see coming until the very end<br />-Sleep with your lights on for at least a week<br />-Consider therapy for your horror movie obsession...<br /><br />Now for the cons:<br /><br />-Why does no one turn the damn lights on while they are searching/wandering around the house?  Sometimes it was so dark I couldn't see anything on the screen. Maybe that was the director's point but it was annoying.<br />-The wife bugged me.  Who just lets their husband make all the decisions these days and blindly does whatever he wants?<br />-I just know I am going to have nightmares for weeks because of this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Feels like almost owning a realistic horse without the physical responsibilities. I would recommend this game to anyone who wishes they had a real one.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really liked the game.  So much that I wish it were longer!  I played free for a while but then I couldn't go any further until I purchased it. I wouldn't have paid as much if I had known I was pretty much half finished but I was already really into it so I ended up buying.  It was great and had lots of play despite letting you get so far before having to buy to finish.  I did have to use the hints and the storyline was pretty good.  Plenty of action to keep your mind busy.  Now I will be trying to finish it on a harder level.
B007MC0IAG|4.0|The book is written in simple language and explains the science behind most common natural phenomena very well. Liked the book a lot, having been more of a logical reasoner.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|A plot-driven, page-turner. I enjoyed  it, but am happy to be done with it.<br />It became dreary, always reading her doubts and  questions.  Good ending, though not completely unexpected, but then we, as readers have our memories intact.
B005C9YZIM|5.0|This was a gift for my son and he was thrilled. It came very quickly. He has wanted it for some time.

B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I've bought a few of these remastered &#34;greatest hits&#34; CDs , but this one stands alone in it's quality. The sound quality, sound stage, orchestral arrangements and individual contributions are amazing. Billy Preston on the B3, Ray Brinker on drums, Victor Vanacore's orchestral arrangements are inspiring.(on a personal note, it was great to hear Jim Keltner on drums on&#34;Sinner's Prayer&#34; with B.B. King. I remember you when we were both in the Boy's Club Band in Pasadena. I'm sure &#34;Walt&#34; would be proud!)<br />If you are a Ray Charles fan like I am, you must buy this cd!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I always like to own an easy to wear every day watch when I don't have to wear my dress watch or my heavy watch with the metal bands. I forget I am wearing this watch soon after I put it on. The band is sturdy and breathes so your wrist does not sweat. After 3 weeks of wear it keeps time perfectly. It is self winding and so I don't have to get ripped off getting batteries replaced once a year. The knob for setting the time and date is slightly offset so it never digs into your wrist. I don't know how folks wear those big faced, big knobbed bling watches! I like a watch that is classy but you forget it is there.  I have owned several Seiko watches since 1976 and they have always been durable quality time pieces.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I found this book to be critical yet insightful of many female executives in the workplace.  Although all situations cited in this book will not apply to everyone, I found much of it to 'ring true' to the challenges that we not only face but may impose on ourselves professionally.  In order to get the most from this book, in my opinion, one needs to be open to self betterment and constructive criticism and allow themselves to acknowledge behaviors that are sometimes intuitive for women in order to recognize and improve outcomes in the future.  Sheryl Sandberg's personal stories and the account of her journey to executive management are eye opening and at times humorous.  I would recommend this book to any female in management looking to improve and/or reflect on successfully navigating the workplace.
0307279189|5.0|I loved this book.  It's a great story, a fun read, and get into the details of running with a forefoot strike.  Since reading it, I've changed from a mid foot strike to a forefoot strike, swapped out my heavy, padded running shoes to minimalistic running shoes.  It's a tough and slow transition, but it feels like I'm running lighter, and there is less pounding.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is cool but kinda costly but I kept it cause it worked and I love to draw it has paint, pencils crayons stickers it's so cool
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is consistent with other G5 games.  Clever and stimulating.  Great graphics and story with fun puzzles and hidden objects.  This is one of my favorite G5 games so far.
B00999DFP0|5.0|The show is refreshingly witty . The actors have great chemistry and without constant commercial interruption this series is much more enjoyable to watch !
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Great way to pass the time on road trips  or other boring times. Kids love to play it more than I do.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|its got what you need at the free price so that's pretty awesome in my book. also the cat purring is nice
B0063IH60K|1.0|This game keeps showing ads for Christian mingle&amp; match.com ... i don't appreciate the religious oriented ads.  If i wanted that I'd go to church!!!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Still reading, but thus far it is captivating. As a WWII buff, this book is a prerequisite to that era.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I love the monkeylectric, that I brought last summer. I love the image the lights make when the wheels go faster and faster.. people stopping look at my bike,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Keep practicing you'll get there! This game is totally addictive!! I can easily lose track of time playing this game. Great job!!!!
B00AYR2FOI|3.0|The music is good but there is no information about who wrote the songs sung by Boz Scaggs.  I found this disturbing since I know some of the music was not written by him.
0385349947|5.0|An insightful look at human relations in America's corporate world.  She rightfully recognizes that it is all about leadership.  I recommend this book to everyone, but believe that people 30 years old and older will understand it better than the younger generation, who have not had as much life experience.  The Heidi - Howard study results broke my heart, but shed a lot of light on why women in the military have a tough time.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|Showgirls is an awesome movie for adults 18 and older but it's not for children,it's not like Saved By The Bell.This movie contains adult language and adult situations that children aren't supposed to see so if you have any kids under 18 do not let them watch this movie because it's inappropiate for them.So anyway if you buy this Movie for you and you have kids under 18 in your family get Saved By The Bell for them that is if they like Saved By The Bell that way you'd have Elizabeth Berkley in this movie Showgirls for the adults to watch and Elizabeth Berkley in Saved By The Bell for the kids to watch.That way the kids and adults would both have something to watch instead of one or the other,it's a good idea.<br /><br />If you have kids 18 and up,they can have this movie Showgirls and Saved By The Bell because kids 18 and up are allowed to have Showgirls and Saved By The Bell.
B006P3HXZG|4.0|A very entertaining movie!  So well done, everything appears realistic even though it is a cartoon.  My adult friends (in their 50s) recommended this movie to me.  Great for all ages.
0439023513|5.0|My wife loves Suzanne Collins writing and this is no exception.  Thoroughly enjoyed the book!
1609611543|5.0|I haven't finished the whole book but so far it has been great. I have learned a lot. Thanks for the great book.
0439023491|5.0|Great product!  Will be back for more!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|I've been watching movies since the time when theaters cost five cents to watch a double feature, with cartoon. Rarely have I seen a movie in which every actor was perfect for the role played. Each and every one performed exceptionally. Having not heard of most of them, so not able to verify their abilities prior to this movie, I can only hope that this professionalism carries throughout their careers. Cudoes galore to Ms. Bigelow and the producers for putting together this exceptional cast. For those who disliked the language and/or the torture sequences, GET OVER IT! People whose lives depend on their next move talk that way. And having water poured down your throat is infinitely better than the feeling of your airplane crashing into a building and exploding. I hope Ms. Chastain and all the others have long and prosperous careers. And am very much looking forward to Ms. Bigelow's next movie.
0439023483|5.0|Great product!  Will be back for more!
B00992CF6W|5.0|how come only on the Apple products there are extra apps connected to minecraft pocket edition why can't it be on other formatted devices? what's up with that
1250000971|5.0|bought several Jeffrey Archer books for my wife.  She loves to read most of them. This is one she really likes.
B000001ELB|5.0|This has ALL of the most famous Kiss hits.  This double CD was used but it was in excellent condition, no scratches.  The price was right, too, no sense in paying top price if you don't have to.
B003R1B9MW|5.0|I am not a big fan of Shia LeBeouf because I don't care for his real life character, but the character he plays in this movie is excellent and well played. This is also a family-friendly movie with minimal bad words in it. I highly recommend this movie for some inspirational viewing!
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best character studies in recent memory. The twists and turns never stop along with ever changing  allegiance, disbelief and discuss. A must read for folks that like we'll written suspense. I would definitely recommend this to any thinking BOOK lover.
0345525558|5.0|I loved this book and finished it in three days. Could not put it down. It's the sort of story that haunts you as you're going about your day, doing dishes and rotating the laundry. It was a book club assignment, thank goodness, or I might not have discovered it. I will now recommend it to family and friends. The characters (including minor side characters) are lovable and fascinating and flawed, never quite behaving as you expect, but every page brings hope, and the ending was just what I hoped. Loved it!
1451695195|5.0|Remarkable Story.  Written so laypeople can understand it.  Read it!  While hard to believe, it is a marvelous read.  Terrific
B008OOYALE|5.0|Hatching eggs reveal a surprise every time. And those dragons need food to grow. Thank goodness they only need to evolve to level TEN!
0783225210|3.0|A peculiar take on WWII, and lots of confusion to compare with actual happenings during that time.  A comical enactment of serious living
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Very validating for any woman in any career from full time Mom to full time CEO.  Sheryl is spot-on in her assessment of how women are viewed in the workplace today, and how we can overcome some of these objections.
0307593525|5.0|The two volume set is wonderful.  I love to cook and have always loved Julia.  Very glad I bought it.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I've just finished reading this dark, dark book, having read Gone Girl by the same author a month ago. Gillian Flynn has a great gift with language and images and turns of phrase, like someone's \\"mustardy armpits.\\" There is real magic in the stories she spins, and it's transmitted through the words.<br /><br />Maybe it's just my mood, but I really disliked all of the characters in this book, without exception. Libby and Ben Day, siblings who literally barely survived their childhood, gain some sympathy through their victim status, as the book goes along. But they are both so marked by what happened on that January night in 1985, and by their extraordinarily dysfunctional family life before that night, that they are very hard to like. I found myself rooting for Libby and Ben while disliking them intensely.<br /><br />The story is structured perfectly and unfolds in two timelines through different people's perspectives. All this works well, and I enjoyed piecing together what really happened that fateful night along with survivor Libby, who has taken on this detective job for personal reasons. But the revelations at the end, following all that has led up to them, left me wondering why this story really had to be told.<br /><br />I was left with the feeling of a nihilist experience - a lot of good and even poetic writing, but hateful characters doing hateful things for no good reason other than being young or stupid or drug-addled. Libby and Ben's mother is a character I doubt many mothers will ultimately identify with. I'm glad I read the book, but it was missing something important, like a ray of hope or a feeling of redemption amidst the ruins.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game let's u totally make u want your own horse it is amazing. And it is a really good game for kids who live in a city and want to be a country
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|But, what the Eff did I just watch?! This moving was bizarre and weird and loco! If you've got nothing to do and you don't have any children, I dare you to watch this from beginning to end in one go!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Rating 'The Sessions' 5 stars, because I was engrossed with the courage and humor of different scenes, dramatic, gentle or belly laughers. I didn't hear much while it played in theaters, but Helen Hunt's Oscar nomination poked my curiosity. I recognized John Hawkes as the tortured suicide in the opening of the 'Miami Vice' movie and the uncle in Winter's Bone. His poignant performance here inspired me to look up Ben Lewin (writer-director) and the real-life character. I'll look for more of their films at Amazon Instant Video. The Sessions makes me appreciate my blessings and opportunities to live life in joy.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I'm a fan, so anything I say will be positive. If you are a fan you have to watch this at least once.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it because it is fun and addictive. It also fun because you can try and beat your friend  what is good as well. A recommendation would be to do it in grimsby near the humber bridge
B005PV81MS|2.0|Wasn't fond of the whole 'street kids do right by the hood' after they tried mugging people. This is one time were I wished the aliens would have won.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the minecraft games but<br /><br />-wolves (tamable)<br />-Ocelots (tamable)<br />-a skin studio<br />-mods<br />-Mobs in creative<br />-enchanting<br /><br />Should be put in the next update. People would buy it more.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|It was interesting to see Batman written in this style. If you are a fan of the Bat, give it a go.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most addicting game but also is VERY fun! There are always surprises and any thing u could ask for!
