B001DMJ9R4|5.0|I stumbled across this looking for live music from A7X. Not sure how I missed this back in 2008, but now that I have it... WOW! Diamonds in the Rough is awesome from beginning to end. Not a single bad song. But what I was really after was the DVD. I ripped all the songs to .mp3 and rock the $#!* out of this in my truck and on my iPhone. At $10.99 this is a steal. \m/ (-_-) \m/
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wonderful game all the way around. Some of the levels are really hard. But still great. Recommend to everyone who loves games.
B006PE6VW6|5.0|This movie is a very funny.  I wish they had some people that spoke boston in it since i am from there.  But hey what can you do.
1401223176|5.0|ive read a lot of comic books, both paperbacks and normal issues and omnibuses, but this paperback also known as graphic novel is a great way to start learning about batman and his villians and his overall story. its long, fun, filled with amazing art and a great story. I would suggest this to any dc comics fan and especially any fan of batman. if you haven't read this, you don't know what your missing!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Loved it when referred with sustain to their American relatives. The English sense of humor is spot on. This way of life reminds me of my haughty English ancestors.
0985557834|5.0|Great book  glade i got it  best one yet i think  cant wait for next one lol yay. More booos
1935182617|5.0|This book does what it says on the description. It gives a good in-depth, step by step review of the iText framework. I used this for a project I had at work to edit PDFs (using .net and iTextSharp.) This gave a good insight into how the framework works and doesn't get too burred in how a PDF actually works.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just finished Season 3 and I love it. So easy to use and convenient as I can watch anytime I want to.  The visual and audio quality of this product is excellent.  I would recommend this to all the Downton Abbey fans.
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|awesome record from the masters minus Ward, but an excellent record with amazing songs  with amazing riffs from Iommi the riff MASTER
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|this show is an edge of your seat, jaw dropping, thriller. i would strongly advise you purchase this and buy the second season. i loved it!
B006OFN0SE|4.0|I like this movie.  I did find it hard to follow in places, and a little bit boring. Overall it was good.
B001FQIWSK|5.0|The movie is brilliantly filmed, but as a viewer one needs to be knowledgeable about the subject on hand, because the action depicted is what the girl imagines (which isn't always factually correct). This, I believe, is one of the reasons why this movie is so charming.<br /><br />With great filming, great acting, and a great plot, this movie is a must watch!
B003U4UNPK|5.0|I love Lost. I look forward to watching it every night. I love the characters, especially Sawyer! Yes I love this show, love love love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is soo fun! I'm totally adicited!! I can literally sit and play this for hours; it totally helps that the Minions are adorbs!!!!!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love magic, and have played for quite a while offline. Now this actually feels more like the classic game than previous installments. The only downside is, it does suck power something fierce.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It is a great game I was stuck on it for the longest on time it's a great game I highly recommend it to you.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|If you want a novel set in the ancient Aztec world look no further than Zoe Saadia. An entertaining read that captures the essence of the period well, without sacrificing the story to do so.
B008GJV19Q|5.0|Just a beautiful movie which I have enjoyed several times over the years.  When the North wind comes calling you..............
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Didn't think much of this game based on graphics, it more than makes up for that with the need to play each level over and over....and over.  Can't put it down.
B003NS2T9G|2.0|So implausible I couldn't get myself to watch the second episode... perhaps the writers can imagine a more realistic scenario in future.
0393317552|5.0|Our library nonfiction group read and discussed this book.  It's an ambitious but worthwhile read.  Much of the material was new to us.  It is explained in clear and readable text.  The author does repeat points, but the text is so informative we didn't mind.  This book explains the sweep of progress and invention and introduces original concepts.
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|An excellent CD.  Great songwriting, performance and recording.  Enough hot licks to keep this guitar player happy.  A Grammy contender for sure.
B00C2ISGRC|5.0|The performance of Denzel Washington is superb and the role of Gary Oldman was a nice complement for developing of the story that it was well done by Albert Hughes.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|Using Photoshop for 15+ years so this reminds me of the early versions, but great fun on my tab 2
B005LAIGSC|4.0|This is an excellent action movie with a rush of adrenalin, and as always with a superb performance by Denzel Washington but a poor acting by Ryan Reynolds.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|What an incredible concert!  Hours of blazing pounding heavy Priest in ultra-color!  A concert DVD you'll find yourself using again and again.
B00C2ISGKO|5.0|This is a great movie and worth the price you pay for a steelbook presentation. Excellent to be part of your own collection
B00AAU7AI0|5.0|A reminder of wisdom,and a guide to a well lived life..very well written..I would recommend and give this book as a gift.
B008EKMB82|2.0|Not one of the best I've chosen to read.  Hard to get through.  I only finished it because it was our book club selection for that month.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you love minecraft for the PC then you need to get this app. even though it does not have all the features of the PC version yet it is still a great way to satisfy your minecraft addiction while away from your computer. a games quality is not determined by its graphics but by how fun the gameplay is.
B008B3MZNI|4.0|I bought this for a gift, but I'm not sure now...<br /><br />Very sad it is an official product and it doesn't have subtitles...
1878424319|5.0|This book has made one of the biggest impressions of how to change my way of reacting to people and events.  For something that seems so simple, the changes it can enable if followed are quite profound.  I love being able to not take everything so personal.  My relationship with my husband has also improved as a result of both of us trying to live by these agreements.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I bought this for my sister's birthday and she loved it!! So much more to it than just Get Lucky. If you like Daft Punk you'll enjoy it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I carry a Benchmade pocket knife wherever I go and it is important to always keep it sharp.<br />This is a unit that is small and can be carried in a backpack, briefcase or your pocket.<br />Works very well and sharpens quickly.<br />Note:  It doesn't take a lot of pressure to maintain an edge.  Just hold you knife straight and use slight downward pressure while dragging the knife backwards.  Keep the handle at a 45 degree angle.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game the tournament room is my morning game time it helps me start my day. My sister's also play so we send each other gifts every day.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Very easy to use and it doesn't seem to have any bugs in it, as some apps do.<br />I use it on my Kindle Fire and it performs very fast.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Am enjoying this game have two like this on my S3. Love them!! It is an easy to play game and can hold your interest for a long time. I have this one on my KinFire second gen and have had no problems with the game.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very enjoyable story about secrets and their sometimes tragic consequences. Loved the characterization and sharp dialogue very much. Hadn't read this author before but will try her other books now!
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|This movie is about the karmic history of our soul/Pi that subsists inside humans who are living here on this planet (Earth is represented in the movie as the island where Pi finds the meerkats, meerkats = people living inside this planet/the island. It’s important to understand the irony when they say the island/Earth during the day gave everything that existed within life but in the night it took everything back. This is exactly what this world is doing to us; it gives us “life” yet its killing us at the same time as we are staying in it). The truth about who we really are has been hacked from us therefore, we are living a physical animation of a false “reality” that’s far away from the truth.  Fortunately for Pi he knew deep inside something was always missing from his life …God and led him to journey outside of himself/his body/the island/earth to get his answers. Ironically, we are living a fictional movie where we believe we are what we see. Unfortunately, this false identity of who we are and the un-knowingly purpose of our life is the main fall in humanity/ Mr Richard Parker lack of understanding of who he is. Unless we wake up to the truth about the beautiful colors that life has to offer, will end up like Richard Parker’s faded gray in the end where he is seen walking back into the jungle/earth. The consequence in people not journeying into themselves is never finding God and eventually leading to our destruction. Because Richard Parker/meerkats/people/ never understood their connection and relation to God, karma had a way of letting us know the cycle of re-incarnating here will not rest until we get it right.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|BTD5 is a need to get game!! If u don't get it u r a idiot!!!!SO GET IT RIGHT NOW!!!
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|Eeeeevvaaaa!<br /> 19 more words are required. This disney movie is sure to capture your child and your spirit of ?
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Recently I have entered the world of Orson Scott Card and though this novel is not where I would start I recommend it as a great story.  Speaker for the Dead is a great read but if you read Ender's Game first be aware that this novel moves at a slower pace.  Each character you meet has great depth and some are uncovered in the story while I believe other characters are revealed later.  I liked that this story showed Andrew Wiggins as an adult who chose to live his life despite his past.<br />In Speaker for the Dead the author strove to show you the unfolding drama in the events hiding aspects to create a story worth reading.
B008ALA6DW|3.0|Only reason why it got 3 stars is because of the price... 30 bucks? Come on Apple...... Other than that it works great!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a great journey to a futuristic Earth where aliens have wreaked havoc upon the planet causing the world population to work together to find a solution.  I enjoyed that this novel started with such a huge amount of back story that filled in as you read the story.  Each chapter created a new aspect of Ender that added to the three dimensional characterization until you begin to realize you are reading about a child who reacts to many situations as an adult.<br />If you like adventures in space, coming of age tales, and stories about smarter than average children give this book a read.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I love the story Treasure Island. I have probably read it about 6 times over the past 3 years just for fun, just because I enjoy it that much.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My wife and I love this show. This is thrilling to the end. Excellent acting and plot. Fantastic direction, can't wait for all the seasons.
B00CO52NLI|4.0|I love this game!! I just ordered the reptile and foal collections but only the foals are working. The game is telling me I need to buy the reptile collection again. My order went through according to Amazon, my confirmation email, and my bank account. :( Other than the lost money, the game is awesome.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I found so much to love in this book. The characters are complex, and the subject matter is challenging. Not your typical girl meets boy book.
B00004T0US|5.0|Love to hear him sing more contemporary music. Love Moody Blue. Too bad there wasn't more of this allowing him to grow with age. Hound Dog is great but he was, after all, getting older and more mature. Particularly the voice. Such power.
B004ZNB12O|2.0|When compared to other recordings of the the same tracks, I found this one lacking in picking up some of the instruments. They were very faint and could hardly be heard.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Great, well written, sympathetic, interesting characters. Many plot twists and and unpredictable ending.  Fun and interesting read. Stayed up to finish this book.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like the game and all but the update is like go to the app store than u need to restart in I'm like nooooooo but the game is a good game
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Loved this historical look at Jesus through the lens of his time.  Aslan is a great story teller and really draws you in to the political climate of Israel at the time of Jesus.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|I'm not sure just how relaxing this game is, except maybe in the easier levels.  The music is relaxing, but getting 'absorbed' leaves a lot to be desired unless you have a death wish.  It takes a little finesse to progress.<br /><br />Challenging in the upper levels.  Lovely graphics.  Decent controls.<br /><br />It's a Keeper.<br /><br />NOTE:  Update August 30th 2013 did NOT lose my progress--I'm pleased.  Now, if I could just figure out exactly what my progress is, I'd be a happy camper.  Sometimes it seems to put me back into a level that I thought I'd already beaten...but overall, I really like this game.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|No other sub film, not Run Silent Run Deep, not The Enemy Below, comes close to capturing the claustrophobia and sheer terror of being trapped in a submarine that's being depth charged. Das Boot is made from the perspective of the losers so it's about the ultimate futility of fighting for a lost cause. It takes place at a time in the war when the battle of the Atlantic was turning in favour of the allies. The German U Boats had an easy time of it in the first couple of years of the war before the allies had developed the tools and the tactics to  counter the U Boat threat. By 1943 everything had changed, we had broken their codes, developed microwave radar and had sufficient destroyers to protect our shipping. At the start of the film you are informed that 75% of the U Boat crews were lost in the war,  something that the veteran crews in the film (with the exception of the ardent Nazis) understand. The film follows them on their hopeless mission as they hang on to survival by their fingernails. The tension is unrelenting.
B005GYY0GA|4.0|A nice collection of old standards. It is not going to totally blow you away, but it is a very nice collection. As always, Mr. Winter is in fine form on the guitar.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|Gosh, what a horrid movie. Bad acting and a bad script and moving so slowly that you have to notice how bad both are. I won't be checking out any more in this series, that's for sure. Poor Pierce Brosnan wearing a horse's ass (literally) or at least having one CGI'ed onto him serves as a pretty good metaphor for this whole sorry movie.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I received this free on my Kindle to use in a junior high English class I was teaching. The paperbacks that we had for the students was about an 8-10 sized font and very difficult to read aloud from. My daughter was in one of the sections and got this for her Kindle too. Next year we plan to tell the students about this excellent, free option!
B007AL48UK|5.0|I like this version better than others. The 'summer fun' is! More fun. LOL! It can be addictive! I would recommend it.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I feel like I need to use spoilers to explain my review - so consider this an ALERT. If you don't want spoilers just read the first paragraph of this.<br /><br />The unlikely pilgrimage is as its name sake 'unlikely.' At first the story strikes as a kind of Forest Gump tribute, as Harold Fry decides to walk the length of England to try and see lady other than his wife. Along the way we find out more about Harold and his lady wife 'Maw' (and it should come as no surprise their lives are changed by the pilgrimage)<br /><br />To say the story's tone changes somewhat throughout the mission is like saying sometimes the weather can change. In the beginning the story presents as simple and cutesy (like Mr Gump) As Harold's journey continues however and we learn more about him and his wife and their son David. Its hardly surprising to predict that the son is deceased especially when the wife Maw starts 'talking' to him.<br /><br />The story dances between light and dark, at times casting a funny light on society and people, at others brutally describing the slow drain of a difficult marriage.<br /><br />As a climax, Harold finally seeing his friend Queenie was probably the most unpredictable and disturbing twist in the book. I won't spoil too much, except to say the lighthearted tone of the beginning of the novel was burnt to cinders and trampled into the ground.<br /><br />So is this book recommended? While not overtly enjoyable or touching, I didn't dislike the piece. Harold is hard not to feel for, and Maw and Queenie evoke unusual feelings of tension and guilt. And yet this book doesn't exactly evoke the feel good or trauma of your typical emotive pieces.<br /><br />In short this book falls somewhere between high drama, humor, and tragedy and if you like the ambiguity then it is for you.
B0011Z1BQK|5.0|Achilles Last Stand is the best song ever. Led Zeppelin is better than the Stones. They are the gods of rock.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Couldn't put the book down from beginning to end! Wish I could write like that, Enthralling! How does he do it? Loved the storyline.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|If you cannot handle references to child abuse, you should not watch this movie. Otherwise, it is a well-written, well-acted, interesting drama that is one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />Also, please treat it as fiction. I love memoirs and hate lies in memoirs. This like James Frey's A Million Little Pieces was presented as truth and it simply isn't. As fiction, it is a wonderful revenge tale that deals with several relational motifs.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|Jeffrey Archer amazes me, I can never put any of his books down, until I have read them, this one is no exception,Jeffrey deserves a medal!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|great show, great season, makes you want to get off the couch and get after it. I think I have even learned to appreciate Louis.
1581806574|4.0|havent used it yet but hope fully soon they will i know i used it a few times for some ideas. thank you
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|It rocks the HTC logo on the front, it’s this and doesn’t get in the way and of course stands the phone up so you can watch things without having to hold it up for everyone. One issue is I kind of would have like it to be like the ipad cases that are magnetized on the front so it would stay shut. Otherwise great.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved the concept, the refresher history lesson and the story behind things! The grass is always greener, but is it?
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My  granddaughters( ages 3 and 8) must have watched this 10 times so far. I'm glad it's at their house and not mine!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I liked the free app because i love youtube, I was so thrilled that I purchased the app so that I could download the videos. That's where the disappointment comes in, the first 4 videos I Downloaded went well, but after that no downloads. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The continuing saga of corruption in the legal arena - and how the &#34;have nots&#34; (Mike) press on.....<br /><br />Highly recommended (smile)
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|A captivating family movie, and a deserving part of the Star Trek saga. I would recommend it to anyone, fan of the series or not. I give it five stars for the story, actors' performances, image, directing, casting....all of it. Loved every minute of this movie.
B00AYPXG5W|4.0|I thought it was a very good movie. Based on a true story it was less about the aliens and the abduction, but more about how it effected friends and family
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I can't remember why but I missed this movie at the local Tinseltown<br />and can't wait to see it on my Mits 82\\" 3-D Home theatre with my Bose<br />7.1 Surround... Thanks Amazon for all 3  Mits..  Bose and now this<br />awesome DVD  \\" Man of Steel \\". I will be worth the wait i'm sure and<br />I'll update this review as soon as possible..
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Good enough to finish and an interesting enough story, just not sure that I would recommend to a friend that it was really worth the time to watch it.
080419257X|4.0|Drawing favorably mixed reviews (more for lack of depth of style than lack of depth of content) and some howls of protest from the know-nothing right wing zealots of our own time (many of whom are outraged at a semi-scholarly work coming from a man of Islamic background even though a Christian himself - a fact all too often pointedly ignored), Aslan traces the documentary history of the founding of Christianity beyond the texts - many of which written hundreds of years after the fact and many hundreds of years later still canonized into the modern Bible - to examine the schism between the probable role of the actual Jesus and his immediate successors (James and Peter if not Mary Magdalene, although Aslan does not follow that particular line of thought) and the initially rejected distortions of the outsider/convert Paul who made the movement both more acceptable to non-Jews and more essentially pagan in content. The author may fairly be viewed as a &#34;popularizer&#34; rather than a researcher, since there is little here that struck this reader as actually new, but by making earlier research clear and understandable the book is a valuable addition to the canon of works available on the faith. The substance of the difference of these philosophies and the reason for their supremacy in different historical eras can only strengthen the faith of those seriously trying to ground their faith in reality. The irony of the evolution of the faith away from what potential Roman converts viewed as the too restrictive rules of Judaism and into a less Christ-based hierarchy of Pauline myths and even more arcane (or at the very least Byzantine) rules is not lost on even the cursory reader. The author's reading in this unabridged audio release is pleasantly assured and very accessible. Well worth the light read (at only 8.1 hours over 7 CDs) it is.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|Very description paints a world, but what i have read i do like. A must for any zombie lover. BRAINS!!!!
B000E41MRC|4.0|Excellent refresher on the &#34;The way it was&#34;. Fastforward to nowadays and see the same basic techniques still working well.
1885167776|5.0|Just love that book. Very easy to read...it just flows so nicely that you dont want to stop reading. Get it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game has the best graphics.  just like the movies I wish the characters. could really speak. can play for hours. love it
0807014273|5.0|This book was brought a different prospective on my own life. I  could read it over and over. I recommend it to all.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|OBLIVION, with Tom Cruise. It's very much about working for The Machine. I won't elaborate the story further, other than to say that the RottenTomato rating is seriously off on this one, giving it only a middling score. Beautifully filmed, well paced, solid performances. I can see why Cruise bought the graphic novel from whence the story originates (considering his denominational worldview) - but then, I could care less about his \\"theology\\".<br /><br />Considering the NSA revelations about our own gov't spying on us, repeatedly lying to FISA Court, hounding journalists (\\"Journalism is not terrorism!\\"), keeping secrets under penalty of death - while citizens are denied the liberty of unbreakable encryption to secure our own private space, this really surpasses The Matrix, and I Robot, in many respects. Stimulating storytelling.<br /><br />Wake up America. Read WHY AMERICA FAILED, (by Morris Berman) if you're up for an honest challenge. Much in both products to ponder!
B0083Z614S|5.0|We loved this book read with my daughter and she enjoyed too! I would totally recomend it to any 5th or 6th grader.
B001L83PLQ|4.0|It is an wonderful explanation of the terrible event that tore Biafra apart as seen through the eyes of people who lived there.<br />It is a long saga of a family who suffered through the chaos and at times is frightening.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Excellent movie. Great cast. Great story. Excellent twist to an old classic. Looking forward to more star trek movies with this cast.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Have to spend $ to complete goals. Slow and painful to earn levels. It is pretty though and probably meant for kids.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I was expecting the worst, it stars Tom Cruise after all, but it really was quite decent...definitely worth watching, and a very interesting storyline...
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Had missed this the first 3 seasons and now know what everyone has been talking about.<br />It's a fabulous series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hated the ending!!!  Can't wait until next season,  poor girls all around.  What could possibly happen to the family next.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I just bought these this week and received them a day before the first delivery date, so im very happy. The headset comes with a half charge so make sure to charge it to full before using it. The great thing is of course you  can use it while its plugged in. The surround sound is as great as it gets with two sets of speakers and there is no hiss or dropout for now.
B0001WGIBW|5.0|Brio train is easy to assemble and supplies hours of fun. We have brio and non-brio trains that fit this track. Love it!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Was just ok. Kept you interested to the end, but nothing too exciting. Draged on a little, but the idea was good.
B00555X8OA|5.0|A mind-expanding must-read.<br />Any honest person who confers the title of &#34;critical thinker&#34; upon themselves will surely re-assess the methods they use in making future &#34;informed decisions&#34;...
0064471837|5.0|I LOVE this series, almost as much as Harry Potter. This magical, somewhat dark series is in my re-read list. Garth Nix is coming out with a fourth addition to the Old Kingdom trilogy, so start reading Sabriel so you can be ready for it!<br /><br />I always recommend this to my parent friends who are looking for a book for their tween to read next. A bit darker than Harry Potter because of some of the themes (Sabriel is a necromancer, but Abhorsen's are good necromancers) and creatures that stalk Sabriel on her journey to find her father and of self-discovery. On Sabriel's journey to self-sufficiency, she encounters issues of identity, death, loss and trust.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|It's really hard to find real music these days. Luckily, Emeli comes to the rescue! I love this entire cd. I literally can listen to the whole thing day after day after day and it doesn't get old. The only time I switch this cd out is to hear Chrisette Michele's Better (Deluxe) cd for a bit. For about 3 months now i've been rotating between these 2 cds. When I purchased these, I also bought 3 other cds. The crazy part is I haven't even taken the plastic packaging off of those yet. I will eventually. Buy this today you won't regret it!!
B0012GTZC0|3.0|When I finish reading it, I will review it.  So far it is interesting.  Why do you people always send requests for reviews right after the product is purchased?  Sometimes it is saved for later; sometimes it is a gift which I would not review anyway.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Romance in good way. It had a nice plot with an interesting twist. I have recommended it twice already and am sure I will again.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Not the quality I was expecting but interesting view of contemporary British village life and social issues.  Another complex plot with a multitude of interesting characters.  I prefer a writer to let the characters reveal themselves, as we know Rowling can masterfully do
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I had heard from friends that his story was irrefutable. Even though I believe in the afterlife and NDEs, 'irrefutable' was a pretty strong claim. Well, when he started getting into the science of it and when I read to the end, my word for it is, irrefutable! It also helped that I had just read this when a dear friend passed away unexpectedly; it really helped as I grieved for her that I felt like I knew what she might be experiencing in heaven and that brought me some joy in this hard time. Our church's men's group is basing a study on this book and I recommend it to everyone!
B0063IH60K|4.0|For most ages. you will enjoy playing Solitaire. Won't want to stop playing until you have won a few times.I have no dislikes about Solitaire.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Ilove this game it has all the hidden objects and mini games I love and it takes some thinking and thought also it is not a skort game and everything has a point. I play this game over and over again.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|So fun and addicting I would highly recommend this game it is a great one for kids to  and free
B009K916ZK|5.0|I use this with my MacBook Pro to watch Netflix on my tv with a vga cable. Totally does the job. Zero problems.
1455502626|5.0|Fast paced with a surprising ending; Just love John Corey, what a character. And so smart, he never fails to solve the problem.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Comfortable headphones with great sound deliverance quality.  They fit snugly and keep out ambient room noise.  Love these.  Makes my work with audio much easier.
B000FC13E0|3.0|I've read a few Crichton books, and while this was certainly not his best, it wasn't bad either. The first half of the book had me in \\"can't put down\\" mode then seemed to slow down and become somewhat predictable as the climax approached. I would recommend this book. I felt it was entertaining and contained interesting scientific concepts (not sure of the realistic extent at this time).
B00640UICA|4.0|I wouldn't go as far as saying &quot;its not for kids&quot; but I guess its pretty challenging for some as well...It has a clean and smooth UI and its very well put together...I would definitely recommend trying the game because its really clean and simple...
B000053V7Q|2.0|The reason that I don't like it is that in it he (Elvis) uses God's name in vane and kinda' laughs about it. So I wonder, was he Godly or not? He's done so much Christian music, was that just to sell himself???
B00E1LAS42|4.0|I loved the movie, music, and actors were perfect!!  I had to buy my digital copy to watch anytime, anywhere!! I watched it twice already over the past weekend.  Now I just need to read the book, maybe this weekend while I'm at the beach.  Loved, loved, the movie!!
B0056JJY2K|5.0|In my humble opinion one of the 10 best movies ever made. I saw it for the first time in the early sixties when I was about 10 years old. It was the first time I had been emotionally involved in a movie. A great story and beautifully filmed by George Steavens, very unlike most westerns filmed during this era. I've seen Shane many times over the years and I liked it as much at 62 as I did when I was 10. Can't recommend this film enough whether you like westerns or not.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHER MATCH 3Games AND THIS ONE BEATS THEM ALL. I HIGHLY Recommend This game.
B0039N74CW|5.0|This is a good movie, for adults as well as kids. Just the karaoke ending is worth the whole movie
B000002LR6|5.0|have had this album before and its been one of my favorites and I listen to it all of the time.
B000B8QG22|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie. The music was right up our alley, and Robin Williams is a riot of fun
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The first person makes it so much more compelling and inspiring read for adults and teens. Truly dives in to emotional complexities and allows you to really get to know Charlie and his friends and family.
0399165274|5.0|If you like Frederick Forsyth ( an I really do) , then you will enjoy this book. Was a bit worried about the negative reviews , but plowed ahead and got the kindle version . Have had a hard time putting the book down. One of the things that I really like is the background info that is provided durning the telling of his stories.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's real good I love it and it got real addicting it really awsome my lil cousins love and they're 5
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|This movie is lots of fun if you enjoy learning how music was recorded back in the day. My favorite part was learning how Fleetwood Mac all got together.
B008JFUN6E|1.0|There are some humorous scenes between Matt Damon and droid characters in the opening moments which give promise that this will be a smart, funny, enjoyable sci-fi pic.  Alas, it was not to be.  Very soon, the film turns deadly serious, deadly dumb, deadly dull, and, well... just plain deadly.<br /><br />In this installment of the classic struggle between Haves and Have-Nots, the Haves are Rich Evil White People, who run and continue to wreck the Earth from their paradise space station, Elysium,  the 22nd century version of the gated suburban community.  Meanwhile, the Have-Nots are poor but caring people of color, mostly Hispanic, who seem to want nothing more than to care for their children, many of whom seem to be falling ill.<br /><br />Somehow, Matt Damon finds himself in this mix as the would-be hero of the Have-Nots.  Why?  Because Matt Damon is a top box office action star, and there be action coming!  Still, Matt Damon isn't quite bad-ass enough, so they shave his head and rough him up a little so he looks like a mini Bruce Willis.  Let the action commence!<br /><br />What the Have-Nots seem to covet most about Elysium is the access to free and perfect health care.  Every McMansion in the rich white suburban world has a medical device in the living room that can miraculously cure any ailment, in seconds.  Childhood Leukemia?  No problemo.  Lie down in this MRI-looking device and whoosh! The 1970's style digital readout now flashes, \\"Cancer cells 100% cleared!\\"  My microwave doesn't even work that fast.<br /><br />Is this sounding political enough yet?  Wait, there's more!  The poor but caring people of color try desperately to get to Elysium to save their ailing children, but alas, the Rich Evil White People have a Department of Homeland Security (run by Jodie Foster playing the Michele Bachman-type-conservative-bitch character) that ruthlessly cracks down on such \\"illegal immigration\\" by shooting their ships out of the sky.  And, in a subtle nod to the Truther movement, they use a rogue CIA-type spy to act as a terrorist and shoot down the planes of the people of Earth.<br /><br />The plot gets really convoluted when Matt Damon's character, Max, gets exposed to radiation after an Evil White Person forces him to do something dangerous on the job.  Damon is given 5 days to live, but the health care on Elysium could save  him.  So a plot is hatched with the people of color to kidnap an Important Evil White Person and download his brain which has some software code that will control everything on Elysium.  Will Damon and his Hispanic cohorts make it to Elysium to save himself and the people of Planet Earth?  Who cares.<br /><br />The storyline and characters are so silly and paranoid and one-dimensional that all that's left to care about are the action sequences and special effects.  It becomes like watching a bad video game.  The fighting scenes are interminable and so over the top that they border on self-parody.  You would think that by the 22nd century the technology of violence would have advanced to the point where it would be quick, quiet and efficient, like a zap from a ray-gun.  But that would be no fun to watch, so here the weapons are bigger, louder and inflict more gory damage.  Fortunately, there are  high tech gizmos to fix you up, so the fighting can continue another round.  In one scene, Damon, whose huge machine guns and bazookas have been unsuccessful in killing the main bad guy, explodes a grenade in his face.  All that is left is some bloody bones.  But wait!  His comrades run him through the trusty Facial Reconstruction Machine, and faster than you can say, \\"Yeah, right, what a crock\\", voila! He is as good as new, and ready for the next action scene.<br /><br />This is what happens when you give a film-maker a bad script and too much money.  For much better movies on a similar theme, check out Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green, and Blade Runner.  Someday Matt Damon will be embarrassed that he was inthis movie.  I am already embarrassed that I watched it until the end.this movie.  I am already embarrassed that I watched it until the end.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|i loved this movie and the music that went with it, it reminded me of when i was young teen
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Don't generally like many &#34;kid group&#34; movies, but these guys were great, on the order of the kids in E.T.  Excellent movie with lots of suspense.
B001ED7C58|3.0|it was ok but i loved the movies better.  anything from twilight is good to watch or hear, yea yea
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|You can't beat the Brits for great drama.  Everything they do seems to scream qualitiy - the acting is supreme and the story is one of depth of character and gripping suspense.
B0017ZB8M6|2.0|i don't remember buying this album so i'm not tottaly sure how it sounds.  it should be pretty good none the less
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I admit that once I got to level 10 I wasn't sure I'd make. But alas I did. The game is the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My entire family loves playing this game and it id nice that it provides entertainment for ages 4 to 42. We also posy temple run but enjoyed this one even more. Thank you.
B00122HW92|5.0|one of my favorites! they are at top form in this concert. the sound is very clear! three more words!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is very useful for determining how much longer it will take to get a full charge and how much battery life is left.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book is truly inspiring.  Learning about the lives of those in Lincolns cabinet like Seward, Stanton, Chase  and others was so interesting.<br /><br />I didn't want the book to end and my only consolation is that now that it is on my KINDLE , i can read it  again.  A wonderful book.
B007AL48UK|4.0|i like most mahjong games .. i like the setups and the pictures are easy to see on the tiles.. so i think this is a good one..
B009IU6BIS|5.0|I just love this movie. It doesn't matter what time of year it is. I watch it all year long. Funny. Just love it I would give it ten stars if I could.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Only drawback is the great difficulty in getting rare items to complete rooms, thereby making it almost impossible to complete rooms.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|Spaztasticly m-azingly great! The alien race would watch it errrday. That is how great it is! Watch it! Ya boy
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's cool and really fun to play I like this game so much I would play it all the time if I could ;)
B004H4XI5O|5.0|The humor of this book really makes<br /> the subject far more entertaining than to other wise be. I Loved it
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|Certainly, this soundtrack suited the movie.  Each scene is matched perfectly by Hans Zimmers' mechanical score.  The only issue I have, is the soundtrack is not a stand alone soundtrack.  John Williams score can be listened to from beginning to end and appreciated without knowing it is matched to the movie, but alas, Zimmers' can not.  Certain tracks deserve repeat listening, but in truth, the finer, more musically pleasing tracks are on the bonus disc.<br /><br />Enjoy.
159463176X|1.0|I bought this book because I assumed that this writer had written another great book. Not so. This book is all over the place and hard to follow. I have put it down many times, picked it up to try to read another chapter and find myself lost trying to figure out who is who.I probably will give the book to our local library and maybe someone else will be able to figure it out.
B004QL7K70|5.0|great price, delivery was too long but i think that was on my postal end, but other than that everything else is a ok...
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Easy to use, free, if you need to do simple mathematics then by all means use this!  Its simple and easy~!
075669812X|5.0|I purchased this for my 6 year old.  He loves the pictures and looks at it constantly.  The &#34;green ninja guy&#34; was an added bonus.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is great i love playing with friends and i love fighting herobrine although i wish they would hurry and get realms up and working
B008NQYWC0|4.0|I used to be a huge Stephen King fan when I was a teenager, but as I got into my 20s I got tired of reading about gore and sick, twisted individuals, so I gave his books a rest. This is the first of his books I've read in 20 years and I thought it was great. I'm a huge fan of time travel in general, so he already had me with the premise, but there's a lot of crap time travel out there. This is well written, detailed and interesting from beginning to end. I wish he'd write more stuff like this.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|One of the best HS themed movies around. Transcends generations too - just watched it with my college/HS age daughters and it resonates with them as much as it did me all those years ago. Love John Hughes!
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|I played with this game a little but honestly could not figure it out. I like a game that is easy to figure out but challenging enough to keep me interested. I tried it only once and haven't gone back to it
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great book but you need to have read the other books in the series as I have. We'll miss Robert Jordan.
B0045DO8II|5.0|had the album i wanted the CD. I had seen the Outlaws 7 time back in the day great great
B007HC3LHS|5.0|There is such a sinister tone throughout the book that I couldn't read it before going to sleep - but I also couldn't stop reading it. Really well written and believable.
B0057URWSQ|5.0|To the writers of Suits.. I applaud you. The quick wit and intriguing plot had me hooked from day 1. And last but not least, the actors. Top notch. Five stars.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|What can you say...if you're a fan you will pay anything for the Matt Smith series.  But with this I didn't have to.  Good price and quick delivery.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I've loved many a good crime drama over the years, and been intimate with a few (L&O - all genres, and I still miss Lennie and Elliott, NCIS, Criminal Minds, The Closer, Rizzoli & Isles, etc).  The storyline of Castle stays fairly fresh, but the real sizzle is the chemistry of the cast!  Nathan is on my Christmas list and Stana makes me proud to be female!! You have the sizzle between Castle and Beckett, the sparkle of Alexis, and the wicked wonderfulness of Martha (go Susan!!)  Add Javier, Kevin, and Lanie along with the occasional Cannell, Patterson, Connelly, etc and you can't stop having fun with this show!  Flooded as my channels are these days by the oceans of reality insanity, nay stupidity! this is a most refreshing moment in the week!  Things are not quite so fun now that Castle has his Beckett in hand, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed that our writers will find a fun solution.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Cover is misleading.  Not much screen time for Morgan Freeman, but any time is good.  Tom Cruise and other characters convincing.  An intriguing possibility.
B008Y768XO|5.0|I watched this film with no idea what it was about beforehand and yes I did cry, but it was a good cry. After discovering at the end that it was in fact a true story I loved it even more. The one star reviews are what made me want to actually review this film. It seems to me that if you think this movie is not appropriate for kids, or you think it was somehow cruel to animals, then you are cynical and delusional. How is loyalty, love and innocence not themes appropriate for kids? The dog dying is not tragic at all. Death is a part of life. Its how you die, tragically, violently, or heroically that makes the difference of whether or not its appropriate for kids. The dog did not want to forget his friend and never gave up hope that he would one day see him again. The people in this story were 'human' enough to recognize the greatness of that sentiment. Isn't this the kind of hope we teach our kids about in church, school, and fairy tales? Life is cruel sometimes, and that makes us forget or stop believing greater things. Its rare to see people make it into their old age and still possess this kind of faith. Haichi was faithful his whole life. I think it is fitting that Haichi was immortalized in bronze. He never forgot about his friend, even in death. That's something worth teaching our kids about for generations. One final thought, at the end, when haichi died, we see him reunited with his friend. Of coarse this did not happen in the physical realm, but if you don't believe in spirit or inspiration, then why do you care about the moral message and how it affects your kids at all? If you care, you'd serve them better by letting them watch the movie, have a little cry, and then explain to them about the message so that they understand why it is meaningful.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is the second time I've seen this movie, and it was as good as the first time. I was bored.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I thought this was a great movie. I liked it very much and watched it twice. I will purchase this for my collection.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|For all who are searching for a greater purpose and meaning in their life, this is a story you have to hear.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love these guys. You can hear how much fun they had making the album and the are definitely very skilled musicians. I'm a big fan
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Absolutely.  A wonderful game to see how fast you can be to gain enough points and if you want to share with friends.  Great road game.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|Nice little tri-pod and very cheap price -- but, it is not designed for iPad Mini (although it was advertised to do so). Regardless, I will use it for other applications.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I will never change with this game.  Loved playing for a long time.  This is also a great road game.  Would recommend it to all.
B003YV64OI|5.0|After having use a cheap sempron for a year, I saw this as a great succesor. It's fast, you can probably unlock the unused core if you have luck, and you can probably use it to upgrade an old AM2+ motherboard system. It's easy to overclock and for the pricerange, you can't go wrong with this if you are just upgrading the system.
B0097AX6EQ|4.0|Gave a very detailed incite into the situation these guys faced every hour of the day - head spinning at times
0307595579|5.0|I really liked the series and after having read it on paperback, I really liked to have a hardcover copy for display. The covers look and feel awesome!
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|This is a pretty cool app but I honestly don't use it. I downloaded it because it was the free app of the day. I would not have paid for it or probably even looked at it.
B0024Y9EYS|3.0|The show sticks and skips (makes it annoying to pay attention.)  Our family has watch a lot of TV shows via Amazon and only a few have done this... by far, Terminator was the worst.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Watched this 3 times. What an interesting and entertaining documentay. The history of this  music era gave me an ever better appreciation.  Yes I can buy the sound track but the DVD is better to enjoy the music.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is really cute and FUN! Didnt think I'd like it but was pleasantly surprised. Great for a quick 5 min break too.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I thought this would have a story but it's mostly HO and they are extremely hard to find. Everything is timed which I don't really care for. I guess I need better vision cause some of the items are really tiny. I will not pay for advancement so when I can't do anything I play another game. I can't recommend this game unless you have plenty of time and don't mind being frustrated.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I have only seen the first few shows so far but I recall, from having watched the series years ago, that I really like this Dr. Who and was really bummed out when he morphed into someone else.  It took me a while to get used to Tenant.  I'm really looking forward to watching the rest of this series.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|This is maybe one of the most exciting books I've ever read. Okay, it may have some science flaws, but don't dig into it, skip those highly educated skeptics and you will have great time reading this book. I just couldn't put it away, it is fast paced, dynamic thriller.
B004VFOS2Q|5.0|-I heard some of the music and needed to see the whole story.  The music is beautiful, the lyrics and dialog are witty and the whole thing delightful!
B00DH1G7DS|1.0|I got a different Sudoku app. This one refused to respond on my Sansung Nexus 10. (You know, one of the most powerful processors in any tablet?)<br /><br />It was so slow that i would have to wait about 10 seconds before I could input the next number.  Because of this lag, it was impossible for the app to award me three stars once I completed the puzzle.  I would also get the &#34;Summer Sudoku has stopped responding&#34; error.  I'd tap &#34;Wait&#34; and it would finally come around.<br /><br />Uninstalled and I can actually solve puzzles now. Don't waste your time.
0486282112|5.0|2013-08-23
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a well written book.  I felt the pain and denial of the parents. Although this was not a true story you can understand how parents will go to any lengths to defend and protect their  children.  It's a natural instinct and response.
B00165KRQU|5.0|Doesn't get any better than this. Take the time to see why they had so many hits.....fantastic arrangement and creativity.
B001UJUGZY|2.0|First of all, the cover of the movie has nothing to do with the plot whatsoever.  Secondly, the movie was not as thrilling as I thought it would be.  The plot was not as strong as I hoped, and everything happened so fast which made the plot seemed even weaker.  It is really unfortunate because the movie has such a great cast but the story was disappointing. :(<br /><br />In case you found this movie because you are a fan of Lee Pace, his performance in this movie was excellent; it is worth watching the movie just to see him perform a different kind of role.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|My only beef with the show is the noise the guns make lol. I have been around guns my whole life and they don't clunk like a toy.
B005PK553C|4.0|I wanted to see this because I heard that Jessica Lange was great in it.  She is indeed!  While not for my sister, my brother is a fan and I could easily recomend this to him.  So nice not to have to speed thru the commercials on the dvr.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|The movie was an unexpected treat. First time I actually laughed during a zombie movie because ther was some macabre yet really funny bits in it.
B005C3ME8G|5.0|Heard Xtal on a college radio station back in the early 2000's and was instantly addicted to the soundscapes on this album. I have probably listened to this album more than any other album that i have ever brought. Managed to score a Reissue on vinyl which isn't bad since the price for the original goes for $80 on Discogs. I highly recommend this album if you are looking to explore in the vast world of music.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Overall a reasonable attempt to set up the wizard of Oz but seriously missed the mark with new characters that went totally unexplained.
B00640UICA|4.0|Don't let the cute graphics fool you: this is a fun, relaxing game that is also disguising a challenging app.  With good music and pleasant imagery, you'll probably enjoy this puzzler. Yes, I did check, and the only concern is Flurry Analytics.<br /><br />The object of the game is to get the cute alien-looking creatures - called Peablins - to be happy.  You primarily do this by getting every Peablin to hold hands with another Peablin.  ALL of their hands holding other hands whenever possible!  Some Peablins have one hand, and others have more hands, up to six total.  You arrange them into groups where every hand is attached to another hand in order to make the Peablins happy; as long as every Peablin is happy, you'll complete the level.  By the way, you do NOT have to get all of them attached to each other!  Instead, you can create groups, and each group is comprised of two or more Peablins.  As long as every hand is holding another hand, you'll complete the level.  Otherwise, there are other ways to make the Peablins happy.  Of course, I don't want to spoil it for you!<br /><br />There are over 100 levels spread over 10 episodes, each comprised of a different number of levels.  You need to finish the levels sequentially - no skipping in this one.  However, to unlock the next episode, you only need to complete enough levels to fill the episode progression bar to the red line.  The levels have stars, too.  To get the star, make sure that a Peablin is on the star when the level is completed.  I'm not really sure *what* the purpose of the stars are, though, as they don't seem to have any use so far.<br /><br />The music is rather nice, and is reminiscent of an Nintendo \\"N64\\" adventure game sucn as Zelda.  The graphics look great on my 10\\" tablet, and are simple enough to look fine on smaller screens such as a cellphone.<br /><br />One of my favorite features is the \\"Profiles\\" feature.  You can have more than one profile, which is very nice when you have young ones that insist on wiping out your progress or accomplishing things that you'd rather have earned yourself.<br /><br />I don't like Flurry Analytics, I don't like it having internet access (it plays fine without it), and I especially wanted some documentation and/or tutorials; there seems to be a bug where the first instruction is bypassed if you enter the EXTRAS menu before clicking on PLAY, but honestly even the one that is there is not enough. Incidentally, it is a challenge in itself to figure out how to exit the game.  All of these reasons, perhaps only annoying individually, combine to drop a star.<br /><br />In all, though, it's worth $1.99 to me. Your mileage may vary, however, so it may only be worth 99-cents to you for example.insist on wiping out your progress or accomplishing things that you'd rather have earned yourself.<br /><br />I don't like Flurry Analytics, I don't like it having internet access (it plays fine without it), and I especially wanted some documentation and/or tutorials; there seems to be a bug where the first instruction is bypassed if you enter the EXTRAS menu before clicking on PLAY, but honestly even the one that is there is not enough.

B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Kind of frightening look at what actually happened to this family. Extraordinary story but very sorrowfull on the ones who were not as lucky as the main family. Thousands of people did not survive.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I'm not that old, but i knew good quality when i was a kid. i bought a pair of Austrian made in my early teens. After 20 years the headband wore down and cracked, so it was time for a new pair. These came in and sound just as good as my 25 year old pair of Austrians (even though these are made in china). If you want and insanely good sounding set of cans for (well) under $100, this is a sure bet. Some pairs are still made in Austria, so check your box. You may get lucky. Lastly, lots of reviews talk about items moving around in the packaging, but mine was packed, all in place.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|This book had its moments, but overall I was disappointed with the story and how it ended. The protagonist was supposedly intelligent, but she was attracted to a clingy stalker with violent tendencies. Without spoiling the ending, I'll just say I was very disappointed by her consistently bad choices.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel literally returned me to reading. I was an avid reader as a youth and teen. As I progressed through higher education I read less and less for enjoyment (as I was constantly reading for work). I picked up Sabriel at the library in 1999 in the middle of writing my PhD dissertation as a much needed breather from scientific papers and research reports. Little did I know that it would essentially provide reading material for years (even still). I loved Sabriel and the writing of Mr. Nix enough that I went looking for other things authored by him. What I found on that early Internet was a list of books that had influenced him. Many were some of my favorites from my youth (Lloyd Alexander, Robert Heinlein, Susan Cooper, Ursula Le Guin, & Joan Aiken), but there were many I had never heard of.<br /><br />After a great journey through some of the old greats and newly revealed to me stuff I discovered that some of the books I enjoyed most as a child just didn't hold up very well now. So it was with a bit of trepidation that I picked up Sabriel again a few months ago to do a re-read 14 years or so after  the first time. This is a very uncharacteristic thing for me as I can count on 1 hand the books I've ever re-read. There are too many good books to be going back! I am pleased to say that 14 years was enough to remember the love I had for the book, but forget some of the details so that rereading was still a bit mysterious.<br /><br />Actual review starts here: I am one of those people who refuse to read the back of the book or book cover leaf because I don't want to have anything spoil or prejudice me before I read it for myself. Consequently my reviews are very limited on details of the book, focusing rather on how it made me feel so I don't spoil it for you. Let me just say that I like Mr. Nix's characters. Sabriel is someone that, even though she is a particular type of Necromancer,  I can relate to. She makes decisions like a real person would. Nothing puts me off a book faster than stupid characters who do things that only someone with a rock for a brain would do just to move the story along. Above all else I think this is what I enjoyed about Sabriel. I could enjoy imagining The Old Kingdom where magic not only works, but is embodied in small, smart-mouthed cats (& friendly dogs...). I believed the trials Sabriel faced because there was no sense of a sure outcome. People died while making great sacrifices, others died because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. My favorite books and movies through the years have always been those that are realistic in this at least. Magic, walking dead, bells named after beings of great power that exert that power on the living and dead - all this I can accept as long as actions have realistic consequences and nobody is miraculously saved in a manner that is not feasible within the structure of the story.<br /><br />Well - I didn't do so well on the details, but trust me. Buy and read this book. As a faithful library user I rarely buy books. I've purchased two sets of this trilogy because I recommend them and loan them often. Sabriel is a true treat that has a story that is interesting from the first pages, that stays interesting throughout, that keeps the reader dreaming and imagining life \\"over the wall.\\" Indeed it is one of those books that makes me believe that someplace there may be a wall separating us from our neighbors who live a very different life.a book faster than stupid characters who do things that only someone with a rock for a brain would do just to move the story along.

I believed the trials Sabriel faced because there was no sense of a sure outcome. People died while making great sacrifices, others died because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. My favorite books and movies through the years have always been those that are realistic in this at least. Magic, walking dead, bells named after beings of great power that exert that power on the living and dead - all this I can accept as long as actions have realistic consequences and nobody is miraculously saved in a manner that is not feasible within the structure of the story.<br /><br />Well - I didn't do so well on the details, but trust me. Buy and read this book. As a faithful library user I rarely buy books. I've purchased two sets of this trilogy because I recommend them and loan them often.

1476733953|5.0|I stumbled across \\"Wool\\" while looking for a new sci-fi to read.  After reading the sample, I decided I could risk the $6 for the Kindle edition -- and what a great choice it was!  This was a complete page-turner for me.  I loved the characters and how they were developed.  Even the places where the outcome could be foreseen, it wasn't blatantly predictable.  So, even though in some places I was figuring out where it would probably go, it wasn't \\"Ho hum, I know where this is going\\" but added to the anticipation and left me thinking \\"Will this really happen?  Or will it be something else.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Howley is now on my Favorite Authors list and I've already purchased \\"Shift\\" and \\"Dust\\" with the hope they will be just as engrossing as \\"Wool\\" has been.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I have to be honest.  This book is still in my list of to read.  I have not read it yet.  I do not have to read it yet to know it is a 5 star.  I will read it when it is time.  In the mean time, Chris Kyle is as much a Hero as my son, a Captain in the Army; Veteran of the Afgan war and the recipient of the Bronze Star.  My shock and dismay at the loss of this Hero before his time.  My heart goes out to his family for their loss.

B005KELR3A|4.0|Most of the protective covers for Kindles are book styles.  I don't understand why.  If I am going to buy a Kindle paperwhite for its size and weight, why would I want a cover I would have to handle too?  Still, the Kindle needs protection.  For both my 2nd generation Kindle and my new paperwhite, I've opted for Belkin, zip-up covers. My 2nd generation Kindle had a zip-up portfolio sleeve.  This grip sleeve is on my paperwhite.  Although it doesn't seem as sturdy as the portfolio cover and I wish it were all black instead of black with op-art white, this grip sleeve does the job I want it to do.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|So far, I am loving the crispness of photos, the layout of messages/chat.  I love how you can tap on a photo's comments, or a status update without having to go back and start allll the way at the beginning of the newsfeed.<br /><br />I have one major complaint, tho.  You're supposed to be able to tap on the gear icon next to Newsfeed under favorites, to be able to sort your Newsfeed by Most Recent, or Top Posts..when I tap on the gear icon, NOTHING happens! This is annoying. I want to be able to sort my Newsfeed by most recent. I have a feeling MOST PEOPLE do!! Please fix this, Amazon!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the game fun to play. Additive game though can't stop playing the game once you start playing it. Characters are fun.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|This was a very good movie for teens and adults. Too violent for younger kids. It is an action packed show and really like Bruce Willis.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I loved the book, this is why it does get 5 stars from me. I know there were parts where some people might think it is boring,  too dirty, always the same etc. but I really loved it/them.<br />It was nothing too heavy to read, the perfect summer book for me to read at the beach. I always wanted to read more and more to know what happens next. Yes and it is cheesy sometimes, but I love cheese.<br /><br />If you are prepared to read a book that is everyghing (intresting, boring, sexy, dirty, exciting...) then you have the right one.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I did not like content of this book at all. I wish I would had looked at it closer before I bought it!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Addictive, just like the original.  Harder I think, because it's weird getting used to what the different birds do and learning how to use them to their full potential.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Shows a fairly accurate portrayal of the reality of that era, but the unnecessary display of nudity distracts from the storyline!<br /><br />Either way I like to show, but it does not need to go to the lengths it does.<br /><br />The show could have educational purposes if there was a lack of obscenity!
B004VMUS9G|3.0|It has some really cool features and options, but I really only use it when I am charging my phone or have my phone off.
B0081336FO|3.0|The characters are not as well-developed as you would expect for a show based on Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />I find the show entertaining, but lacking maturity in terms of the content!<br /><br />With that said, I intend on watching more episodes of this show. I find it interesting but a little off key!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I've been using this app on my phone for 2 or 3 years now - it's a great organizational tool.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I heard a bit about this movie and was interested but not dying to see it. I am glad I did!  Worth the time and money!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game fun for hours for all ages. Everyone wants to play it. Would recommend to all especially those with kids
B00821OX98|5.0|My 16 year old got me hooked on this show!  Never thought i would pay money to see a TV program but it was worth it!  Can't wait for next season!!

B0074QGGK6|5.0|Quick read.  Innovative thinking.  Fresh.  Refreshing.  Made me think.  Opened the box for me, and I've been writing more freely since I read this.  Also, it is easy to review.
B003NS2T9G|4.0|It's a great show but needs more comedy in it.<br />It would make it more fun to watch and more interresting.
B005HF0BIE|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this.  I wonder if maybe it is not so good to be king or in the kings court.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|fun game. play it alot. would be better if it had some kinda multi player thing though. little lag on my first generation kindle fire but it will have to do i guess. i
B0059XTV7Q|5.0|I loved the music and the play between the similarities of the women. Very well acted. Enjoyable for many reasons. Costuming was fabulous and period appropriate.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The sole reason I signed up for Amazon Prime was to watch Downton Abbey Season 3.  This show used to be on Netflix but now can only be seen on Amazon Prime.  It was worth every penny.  The Amazon shipping perks don't hurt.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I liked this book. An excellent perspective and accounted for some thoughts I had too.<br />I recommend it but it is not gospel. It is interesting.
B000HF0IIC|5.0|It was a terrible sequel, but its history and I had to own all of the original batmans on bluray.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I love this new take on the Star Trek series.  Because we are on a new timeline, it's fun to see the changes and echos from the original series and movies.  I think the cast is exceptional and have managed to make the rolls their own, when at the same time, you can still recognize the characters.  Escapism at it's best!
0525425578|5.0|I am a true Grisham fan, having probably read all his books.<br />This idea to turn to a younger group is good, in fact excellent and I am thinking about the process of learning good English for kids in foreign land.

B000FC1192|5.0|Neil Gaiman said it was his favorite book he ever wrote, so I knew I was in for a treat. I didn't realize how creepy a children's fairy tale could be! But, black button eyes on humans are worse than zombies, I think.<br /><br />A hand like an alien crawling after you, wow! No wonder this book did so well. It even stole my idea of using a snow globe, yeah right? Honestly, I was thinking about it before I read this book or saw Under the Dome! Now I definitely have to see the movie! It probably scared the crap out of kids, it did for me. I enjoyed the moral as well-to teach kids about being courageous: \\"Because, when you're scared but you still do it anyway, that's brave.\\" How could you not love this book?<br /><br />The other part I loved was the Q & A with Mr. Gaiman at the end. It really gives you insight to his personality. Now, what to read next?
1881273873|4.0|I think this should be required reading.  You not only learn something about yourself you learn about others around you. Having a better understand of the word Love and the languages that it speaks can do wonders for your day to day interactions.  Like I said this is a must read.
B0058SNI58|3.0|Wish the strap had been elastic for a better fit like another pair of crocs I have. These feel loose. Also, the nose is a bit too rounded and don't give a nice look like in the photo.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am so awed by this series..and cant wait to see Season 3!  This is absolutely the best series I have ever watched.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It did however skip around a bit too much for my liking.  I was always having to think......now who was that?  Overall well worth reading
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book so much it was a great read with interesting characters and a solid plot.... Everything was perfectly written and nicely put together
B005IQZB14|4.0|I loved reading about  Ms. Strayed's hike on the PCT and I admire her courage to pull herself from where she had been.
B0077EBWVI|1.0|This movie is an insult to Psalm 150. The music and dance are insults and confusion to descent Christians. It is an insult to many good preachers' kids. Yet, it gives us the picture of today's morality standard in USA, a confused society who couldn't decide what is right and what is wrong.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|I am giving this 4 stars only because I hated it for the darkness (visually and figuratively) and for the violence. But on the other hand, my 13 year old loved it, knew how to play it and thought his Grandma was fun after all.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is well-cast, with lots of witty banter between cast members and sharp, well-written scripts.  It's good to see Castle and Beckett finally together, although it remains a minor plot line.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Really enjoyed it. Had heard there was no talking at all, but there is :-)  Great movie for kids and adults.
1609611543|5.0|I was thrilled to find a book that spelled out some of the reasons why wheat is such a problem for so many people.  The information is well-documented, too.  I have recommended this book to several friends.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie.  I can't quit watching it.  Everytime I do watch it, it moves me even more.  What a terrific story and the music is unbelievable.  I had to buy the complete 2 disk soundtrack to listen to in my Jeep !!  A job well done by all.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it, very excited game. You can share your goals online, change minion runners, spend tokens and money to challenge others with your record.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I read the book because I loved the Netflix series.  The book did not at all meet my expectations. It moved pretty slowly and didn't go into depth about any of the other characters.  It was solely focused on Piper, who keeps reminding us that she is an outsider in prison--the blonde educated upper middle class prisoner. I would skip the book but definitely check out the Netflix series.
B003AVMUSG|5.0|It's a great beginning train set. Excellent quality, good variety of parts, and a decent price, compared to the other sets.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Great mix of irreverent humor and action, wrapped up in a comic geek approved package. Even the sound track was good. All elements combined to create  great adult entertainment while creating resonating nostalgia for superheroism and teen angst.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|As always, Baldacci writes a great mystery--loved every page of it!  Can always count on Baldacci giving us a terrific story.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|I'm a big fan of the man's stylized work and dialogue so it gets my vote. Not to mention the convenience of VOD
0385523394|5.0|This book helped me to work with inmates coming from and are in prison. I now know hoe they felt incarcerated.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|So far a thumbs up for this serieal killer twist. Kind of an original idea to me. Plus, Bacon's always good.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|I enjoyed The Kite Runner, did not like A Thousand Splendid Suns, and cannot recommend this third tome by this talented writer. What's my problem? I empathise with fiction characters and love following their story as it unfolds.<br />I selected this novel on the strength of The Kite Runner, and its opening is brilliant and compelling. Then the characters who had hooked me vanished, a minor player became the main one (for a bit), other protagonists popped up in a jigsaw of time and people. Flashbacks and flash forwards confused. Strangers turned out to be related to so-and-so (remember? No, who was that person? Can't recall, let me search back!).<br />Conclusion: fine wordcraft wasted on a boring set of events over 402 pages. This book is for Hosseini loyalists only.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Though this is a novel it has some historical facts. It is the story of Elizabeth of York whose two brother's were the princes locked in the Tower of London.<br />We will never know what happened to the two princes, if they escaped or were killed. If they  were killed, who killed them?<br />Philippa Gregory can't tell us the answers to these questions but she lays out the events that did happen and the rest is fiction. At the end of the book the author gives us her own personal opinions about the events in history.<br />I really enjoyed this book. It made me want to sit down and research the Tudor history line.<br />A real mystery that has not been solved in 500 years.
B008LP8QE8|1.0|I bought this book as a kendle edition hoping I can read Harrison on iPhone, it's not compatible with iPhone, I even can't change text size on iPad, the book open's just like a regular PDF no Kindle eBook, I want my money back
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|great tools for everyday use. simple for any age to use. I would recommend. anyone that needs a simple calculator to get this app.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I loved it but bated the adds. So I foolishly spent my $1.99 to make it add free. well the video adds are gone BUT I still get adds for other Gameloft games. The more crappy thing is I haven't received a free scratch since I made the purchase hours ago. No timer countdown or anything. I don't get a free scratch every 45 min just because I bought tokens?!?! Lame
B000J5XS3C|3.0|Controls have some noise as you turn the knob but once it's set, it works good.  This is clearly a budget mixer but it's ok quiet and has features adaquate for my small studio needs.  I do some piano music and the occasional video project and it's working fine.  I do appreciate the small size as it's easy to work into my studio space.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|We enjoyed the movie.  Surprised it was about retired opera stars, that is what made it so enjoyable.  Dustin Hoffman always a favorite.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|This is a very creative tale, that only bears a hint of the Cinderella story. I read the sequel, Scarlet, and was disappointed that the other sequels have yet to be published.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|A well crafted and tight plot.  Tech base is plausible and believable.  The story is from a Very unique point of view.  Well done and a good read.
B0013FSXSC|4.0|This is a fun take on the Arthurian Legend, Sean Connery especially really drives home his performance as Arthur. The only real problem I really found was that the special effects don't really hold up, and even felt dated for the time this movie first released. The HD clean-up especially shows the glaring problems with the special effects, and make some serious scenes come across as comical. Still the overall story still does hold up well. I recommend this for anyone who wants to watch a good Arthur movie, or want a enjoyable Sean Connery movie to watch. It also can make a fun movie to watch with your significant other with it's solid mix of action and romance.
B000P0J02E|5.0|Thank You So Much for This Find, Though the Product case was SomeWhat used, the DVD Quality wasn't, Picture Perfect! Will be a Searching for More Dvd'S! Thankx!

0064471837|4.0|Sabriel's father, the Abhorsen, is a necromancer in the Old Kingdom. But while other necromancers bring spirits back from death, the Abhorsen, puts spirits back to rest. Thankfully, Sabriel is safe behind the wall that separates the country of Ancelstierre (think early 20th century England)  from the Old Kingdom (middle ages/classic fantasy) and has never had to live the dangerous life of her father. But when her father goes missing, Sabriel  must set out into the Old Kingdom to find her father, either in Death or in Life.<br /><br />When I was in junior high, I saw this book every time I want to the bookstore and thought, \\"Wow, that's a cool cover.\\" That's right, I judged a book by its cover. But it worked, because Sabriel proved just as amazing as the illustration. At the heart of this novel is a great story, with the unique mythology enhancing the plot rather than overwhelming the reader with new information. Instead, Nix only tells the reader what he needs for the story at the time, with every new term explained by either action or description, unless of course, it's part of the mystery of the plot. Throughout the book, Nix uses a third person narrative to give you a bird's eye views of what is going on, occasionally briefly jumping viewpoints from Sabriel to a minor character (adds a bit of flavor, right?). Sabriel does seem a bit stiff at times, but everything happens so fast that you wonder if she's just in shock or the author needed to work on her a little more.<br /><br />At first, I thought the plot seemed to be a well done, but standard. Then Sabriel meets the cat Mogget, a free magic spirit forced to serve the Abhorsens for all of eternity. Mogget's sarcasm and snarky remarks give the a book a much-needed injection of humor. But more than that, Mogget is a key part of the mystery of the origins of the Charter, the binding on most of the magic, at least the \\"safe\\" magic, in the Old Kingdom. Though this loose end isn't completely tied up until the last two books in the series, Sabriel is independent enough to stand on its own and leaves the reader quite satisfied.books in the series, Sabriel is independent enough to stand on its own and leaves the reader quite satisfied.

B009PK9SB8|4.0|Everything about this makes the camera easier to use. Much easier than using the small screen on the front. And it lets you play back videos and view photos which is pretty cool
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of my son's absolute favorite! Especially after watching the movie.. It's full of colors, it's  great for kids!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|:) all i really wanted was youtube on my tablet but this met those expectations anyways and has come in handy
B003VS0CX8|1.0|I wish we had found time to watch it sooner. It is unable to even be watched because it will play for two seconds, freeze for several minutes, and then skip ahead. If I had watched it closer to when we purchased it, I would return it.....it played well and looked great for about the first 20 minutes. We can't watch any of the rest of it though.....
B008602KQI|4.0|When I began watching this I intended to watch only the first 45 minutes or so and then go to bed.  Ummmm--yeah, right.  The next thing I knew it was about 2 hours later, and I was rooting for Katniss and Peeta.  Jennifer Lawrence was excellent as Katniss, and I also liked Woody Harrelson and Lenny Kravitz in their roles.  Very good movie that I will watch again.
0345529057|5.0|Great series, glad I gave them a good read. Will definitely be keeping these for future reading. Three more words.
0143039431|5.0|It's a classic for a reason! I had never read it, and chose it for my book club. Maybe not the best book club pic, but I loved the book. One of those stories that sticks with you and you end up thinking about it here and there for months later. I also learned alot about the depression in California and the dustbowl plains states that I didn't know before.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|If you have seen previews for the film, you have seen some great special effects of the Airplane but that is such a small part of the story. This is a true character study and Denzel Washington deserved the Oscar Nomination he got. He made this character believable and despicable and sympathetic all at the same time. great storyline with a strong supporting cast. This movie got bypassed at the theaters because so many of the big name movies were out at the same time. But this movie is a gem that you shouldn't miss. A real 5 star show and I don't give those out too often
B003G4W49C|4.0|I struggled with relating all of this to a 6 year old and wished the author had used just a little bit older age, but that was my only complaint.  Overall I was able to fall into the fictional world he had created. Not a bad price and I'm glad I read it before the movie comes out this fall.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book makes your imagination work harder.  All of the events are so completely strange in today s world  and lifestyle.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I just purchased this Facebook App so I don't really have a review yet.  I am hoping all is going to go well!  I have always been very satisfied with<br /><br />everything that I have gotten from Amazon.com. and this app may be a lot of<br />Fun. I am excited and a little bit nervous about how this experience is going<br />to open up my small world.  I just bought a new mystery by P.D.James, so all<br />you that enjoy a good murder and a great detective should definitely check her<br />out.

B0010SKUYM|4.0|This book surprised me. I didn't love it, but the quality of the writing was good enough that I couldn't seem to put it down either. As others have mentioned, I found it a little tough to identify with the main character, but I still couldn't help but cheer for the guy either. Overall, worth the money and an entertaining read.
B000FBFMFW|3.0|Fitz was awfully fraught, too much so to be convincing as a boy or a man. Still, lots of satisfying action, lots of suspense. A worthwhile read, and I will read the sequel.
B00B5A9FLY|3.0|I just want to talk about the dvd covers. Who designs them? This one is so awful to look at! The first 2 season covers were pretty decent, the 3rd one is horrible. The colors are too dark and flat. The torch looks extremely out of place. There's also a lot of empty space surrounding the cast. The 4th one looks very nice. It's my favorite because the cast looks fearless and the colors look wonderful. But this one...... it's right up there with season 3 dvd cover.<br /><br />The ice landscape and sky is pleasant on the eyes, but Arthur's red cloak is way overbearing. There's just no balance with this strong color. I just see a red blob on the right of this picture. Gwen should have been facing Arthur's way. With both facing left, there's no harmony between them. The bottom half is what makes this cringe-worthy. Gwen is on this cover THREE times (Top, bottom, and as a tiny black shadowy figure just underneath the blade). Someone did a garbage job on Photoshop. The cut and paste of Morgana and Gwen... cannot unsee!!! Also, the whole Gwen being kidnapped by Morgana did not feel like a major part of this storyline. I don't understand why this is on the front cover. I would have much rather preferred the knights posing courageously under Excalibur. Morgana on her horse and disheveled Gwen would have looked better on the back.<br /><br /> The complete fifth season should have said 'The final season'. Makes more sense, right? They just had to pick the ugliest way to say \\"OOHH well looky here, it's a 5 disc set!!!\\" Was that black smudge on the bottom right really necessary?<br /><br />Lastly, Why do they keep putting \\"The Adventures of Merlin\\"? Doesn't \\"The Adventure of\\" get dropped in the later seasons? Yes I know it was in the opening credits in the early seasons. But later on it's just left as Merlin. It was changed!<br /><br />I want to give this one star but then my review was just about the DVD cover art, right? So I give the final season to what could have been an amazing epic conclusion to this wonderful series a three star rating because.... well you know why......I'm not going to repeat what many posters have already stated over and over. I respect Bradley and Colin's decision to not renew their contract for Merlin, but the writers completely screwed up the final season.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This card game keeps you interested and playing for long times!  It is much faster than regular card games.  It is great fun.
B005LAII44|3.0|It's pretty good as an action movie but there are some things that I miss.  I won't say anymore because I don't want to spoil anything.
B0012GMU8Q|3.0|ok, maybe I should have known better.  based on customer image I thought it would be orange.  Its not.  These images are from something different.  I just got it in the mail and it's plain old black.  Great soundtrack though!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|wish this show was still on!!  Such talent!! Makes me really want to go see a broadway show now! Thanks!
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I watch this with my almost 16 year old daughter.  Very funny, a bit risqué but well written with many squirmy moments.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Gaimans use of myth and legend are unsurpassable.  The mind wonders through each character in hopes that maybe one day a meeting would be possible.
B00274EYKY|5.0|I hesitated so much to watch this movie thinking it was just another one of those boring non-sense wrestling film or documentary.  I got it as part of a lot of used movies I bought from a friend when moving.  And it was just sitting there, waiting for a night when there is nothing else good to watch.  Based on the title, I never paid too much attention to it.  Now I wish I had watched it earlier.  This is an excellent film that teaches you a lesson that has nothing to do with wrestling.  Looks like Mickey is finding his way back to acting, as he gives the viewer an Oscar worth performance in this film.  Great acting. Loved it.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|This was a gift and  it was well received and loved. Prompt delivery. So much fun seeing the delight when it was given.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|It's a shame his recognition came so late. I would put him right up there with James Taylor and Bob Dylan.  Ordered both albums after watching &#34;Searching for Sugar Man.&#34;  We all missed out on some great music, most of which will never be written, simply because of his being a victim of circumstances.  I highly recommend both albums, and would buy anything new of his immediately.

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded the app and when I tried to play it it would not run... there must be something wring with the game itself
B007AL48UK|4.0|Like the challenge a big more than previous versions. Like to play the new designs and am excited about the doubles of waves and bigger version of the sailboat.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|the first three levels were a piece of cake but now i am stuck on one levels.you need internet for it too
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|With how much the original series meant to me, I was wary of a spin-off originally. That all changed after the first 2-part episode for the series Stargate Atlantis.<br /><br />Right from the beginning I felt the familiarity and the newness that the show tried to express, it took the classic blunders that led to Earth's war with the G'hould and ramped it up x10 against the Wraith.<br /><br />The characters were endearing and really became a cohesive cast through the first season and into later ones. All in all, this show deserves a watch if you're a sci-fi fan, and especially if you're a fan of the Stargate universe.
B007QJ8VBI|4.0|Doris Day was beautiful and such a lady. Cary Grant was funny and romantic.<br />The whole cast was such a delight to see.

B002BWQ6H6|2.0|I had planned to read Transatlantic based on the press it was getting and saw this book actually had more favorable reviews.  I honestly don't see it.  I put it down after 100 pages, just couldn't get into it.

B009WUAK2M|3.0|Stalled about 5 times..took about 3 hours to watch a 90 minute movie. Action was good but not worth 3 hours. 90 min. Sure.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|would be nice to have hits as to what u r looking for other then that a good game keeps u guessing
B000HF0J36|3.0|Not a bad movie.  One of the better shark movies in recent years.  JAWS is still the best.Worth watching.though. I hate when they want so many words in a review when they should feel lucky that I took the time to write anything at all
B00640UICA|5.0|Puzzle games are a dime a dozen, true, but this one has some serious polish. It was not coded in a weekend. To learn how to play just watch the description video. I like it so far. Am going to get more into it and play some more. I will update this review if necessary but for now download with confidence and check it out as it looks like a good game so far. Very very cute animations and characters... and puzzles (levels) are challenging but not too challenging. This game looks like it would be great for kids. The game contains Flurry analytics, which doesn't red flag me out much because they're pretty straightforward. Their web site is at [...] if you'd like to know more about Flurry and judge for yourself. I'm fine with it, from what I can tell it is not shady. The game is clean otherwise. I checked.
B001NLL93W|5.0|One of the best series I have ever read. Hopefully there will be more after the last book. This book was definitely a surprise for me in the story line. Although it was definitely a good surprise
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I would have given this a five star rating had it not been for the fact that Google's support and troubleshooting leaves a lot to be desired. The product is great, small and compact and the device plugs into an HDTV easily and simply. The price can't be beat! It practically installs itself to the wireless network and even logs into the router for you. Unfortunately getting the device to work after that was not so easy. My wireless network recognized the Chromecast but I could not get anything to broadcast from a Google Chrome browser over my Verizon FiOS network via an Actiontec MI434WR Gen2 router. After wasting hours searching online for a solution I chanced upon a chart at [...] and the last entry solved the problem. Logging into the router and disabling the IGMP Proxy under the Advanced tab made it functional.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I love this I have now increase my Ipad size by 10 fold.  It streams flawlessly and is small and lightweight to carry.  They only down fall of the ipad is now solved!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am impressed with the storyline and the writing in this show. Have alwayb been a fan of Julianna  Margolies and she is outstanding in the series.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|You will fall in love with Buck. His journey takes you to exotic locations and he gets to learn if he is able to resist the &#34;Call&#34;.
0307276902|4.0|This was given to me by someone with whom I was in love and who had just told me we couldn't speak anymore for the second time, so this is probably more than a little skewed... still... here's what I thought.<br /><br />This is definitely a book about addiction.  About self-control.  About accepting one's self.  About finding a Truth.  About recovery.  About dealing with yourself when you've failed to uphold the Truth in which you believe.  About learning to live without something you want so badly that you're willing to hurt yourself - and others - to get it.  And it's about Love.<br /><br />Substance abuse is a handy metaphor that rather brilliantly let the author get to much more important truths that affect all of us.  I didn't want to believe that, and I didn't want to find value in the words that I read.  And I certainly didn't want any of them to apply to me, yet here we go.<br /><br />We all have a \\"Fury\\" inside, don't we?  Everyone struggles with it, and everyone loses.  And wins.  It's how we deal with the losses that is important.  My Fury is self-control.  Or, perhaps, the lack thereof.  Or, perhaps, the inability to let it go and still feel comfortable.  And safe.  I feel like that was his problem as well.  I hate feeling like I feel now.  And I hate it even more because I knew it was coming.  I can't help but seeing that in how Frey described his Fury as he iterated through the mistakes he made and the people he hurt - it was impossible to not hear the cadence of \\"I will choose not to\\" keeping time in the background.  But it all kept coming back to Lilly.  Would he had left again had she not shown up in his life in such a big way at the right time?  I think he would have.  So, unfortunately, despite his railing against AA and 12 Steps, it turned out that he did need something to \\"choose not to.\\"  It was Lilly, it was love, it was feeling needed, and, in the end, it was still replacement therapy.  He said he couldn't have gone into that building and come out clean... if it wasn't for her.  So throughout the whole narrative the most important question posed came on the last page.<br /><br />For Lilly, the replacement didn't work.  She ended up being too scared of being alone.  Too scared of being unsafe.  Too scared of making her own choices.  Love requires work, it causes pain, and it never ever makes sense.  Why did James give into doing what he knew not to do when she needed him?  He wasn't in control of himself.  And he was happy to give over that control to someone else because, despite all the potential negative consequences, he still believed that it was worth a shot if he could keep feeling the way that she made him feel.  It was work, it caused pain, and it definitely didn't make sense.  Then he did it all again... and managed to succeed again.  For Love.  So what's the most important question?  What does he do now?  How did he deal with the fact that his love for her could not keep her sober - it couldn't even keep her alive.  Where does his \\"I choose\\" argument go when the motivation for many of his choices just disappeared?  That's the sequel I would have liked to have read.<br /><br />We need order... we crave order.  We want to know who, where, when... and most importantly we want to know why.  For James - and for me - the why really *has* to boil down to \\"because I.\\"  Because I wanted, because I cared, because I screwed up, because I don't have control, and because I don't know who I am.  Because I.  So the love story ends, as many love stories do, with love losing.  Did her presence in his life rob him of true self-control?  Or is giving over your control to someone else the most meaningful act of self-control one can commit?  Every past relationship about which he spoke was not a relationship of giving over and giving in.  It was deception and abuse.  I don't know what happened next, but I like to think that was the most important lesson he learned over the course of his rehabilitation.<br /><br />The most important part of \\"self-control\\" isn't \\"control.\\"  It's \\"self.\\"  We all exist as something we don't understand, and we're only lying to ourselves if we think we can control who we are.  He seemed to come to terms with that pretty early on... but he just wouldn't let it go.  It was a strange juxtaposition to watch him battle the doctors and battle himself in a struggle for control and, concurrently, give up all his control for a feeling.  It's incredibly difficult to live with that dichotomy.  So why do it?<br /><br />I believe you keep striving for self-control... fighting to remain closed off...  fighting to not feel because it's scary.  It's fear of failing, and it's fear of succeeding.  There is no choice that isn't going to hurt or, at the very least, open yourself up to hurt. Disappointment. Unchosen lonliness.  I'm jealous of his ability to have chosen to let fear go.  And it's still driving me crazy that I don't know what he did once that trust was betrayed.  I wonder if he believed her that she would be there for him.  I wonder if he believed himself when he said he would be there for her.  I wonder if she believed him.  And, mostly, I wonder why it has to be so goddamned hard to get it right.<br /><br />It's fear of knowing something so amazing that nothing else can compare.  It's a fear of then realizing that there's nothing else that brings you back to that place.  And a fear that you can't have it again.  A fear of having to choose to live without something you want so badly that you're willing to hurt yourself - and others - to get it.he most important part of \\"self-control\\" isn't \\"control.\\"  It's \\"self.\\"  We all exist as something we don't understand, and we're only lying to ourselves if we think we can control who we are.

B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I enjoy the interaction of the game. Very entertaining. One of those games that you don't want to put down because you want to see what you can do next.
0062255657|5.0|I've only read 3 of his books but I've loved them all. I can't wait u tip my lids are old enough for his children's books.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I ordered this case not really knowing what I was getting. The pictures usually  look better than the product and in this case was.<br />The fold top is not sturdy enough to make it easy to use.  In addition there is no place to put your stylus so you have to improvise. I made a small pouch and fastened it to the front of the cover with velcro.  That really messed up the folding part of the front cover.<br />In addition to that, the front is difficult to fit in the groove on the back to make it stand.  I would not recommend this cover.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I like this show, it's got a great human story, with a good sci-fi back drop. Watched Season 2, just wish Season 3 is available for Prime too.
0670022411|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing! I loved every single moment of it and I highly recommend it to everyone! The storyline is unlike any other book out there and I love that.  This book is at the top of my favorite books of all time list.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is enchanting, magical, thought provoking and a must read if you enjoying being taken to places of wonderment and beauty
B00846REIS|5.0|Well written good plot line.  Keeps reader engaged and in touch with the characters experiences. Would recommend to anyone that likes 50 shades.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|If it wasn't for the slowness of the game I would have probably giving it a 5 star and also because the acorns are so hard to get without paying.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good book: suspenseful  After reading the first chapter, I could not take my hands of the book. I find it captivating and emotional. Must read.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was a good story and we have 2 transplant patient in our family.  A good writer.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Title of &#34;...&#34; says it all. I continued to read the book only because I was on the plane. In the end, not sure what the point was. Quick read.
B000I8HIV8|5.0|Great family friendly movie!  This movie is fun, exciting and entertaining for the whole family.  Lots of action and a good story line.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|This movie was awful. I can't get back the 2 hours that I wasted watching this movie! Don't waste your time on this,  it was very disappointing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story is about young adults with cancer, and much more.  The main characters, Hazel Grace Lancaster 16 and  a three-year stage IV-cancer survivor and  Augustus Waters 17, also a cancer survivor, meet at a cancer support group and have an instant connection. We follow these two and the people around them as they get to know each other and deal not only with their illness, and how everyone around them is also dealing with it. The story is well written, with a common interest bringing them together, and propelling them on a journey of discovery. The author gives us a view into not only the complicated issues of their illnesses but also into the joy of discovering one another, as normal teenagers would.<br />This is the first book I have read by the author, but will not be my last.
B0040I09RM|5.0|simply awesome. very entertaining, good acting, story arcs that are satisfying, but not too long and drawn out, since seasons are only 13 episodes. great show!
B000YGIIQI|5.0|I had read Humble Pie prior to reading this and thorougly enjoyed this book just as much, some was repetitive but it was very insightful as to why the man is the way he is and how he has reached his goals
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I loved this book. I can't wait to read the next one. Hopefully it will be just as amazing as the the first two
0064471837|5.0|It's been over ten years since I first read this book and I still love it to this day. It is a book full of adventure, darkness and hope, with added humour on the side. And because it is aimed at a teen audience it is easy going to read (unlike some fantasy books which I find can be over the top).<br /><br />I won't go into the plot as that's what the blurb at the top is for but if you like strong woman as the lead then this is the first of many books for you.
B001NN413K|1.0|I ordered this not knowing that it was from a seller in Germany...I was under the impression that sellers on the U.S. amazon site were all within the U.S. - The dvd had a european coding therefore it would not play on my dvd player.  I had to return the dvd via us mail and pay $12.95 for the shipping which will not be reimbursed - as a prime member, and as a basic member and as part of the perks of ordering on-line, when an item is returned, the return shipping is paid for - unfortunately, this was not the case with this purchase.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Great app.  Love the knowledge that I receive when browsing the different videos posted.  Everyone should take a little time to learn something from this app.
B007KWD7BK|5.0|When the Titanic sunk, the victims hummed the main intro riff to this album. When American's stormed the Beaches of Normandy, this is the song that they sung to themselves silently.<br /><br />Stoner riffing is repetitive and hypnotic at times ambient and drone worshiping. Dopesmoker is a legendary feat, a juggernaut stoner, mountain man masterpiece.<br /><br />The gambit of emotions that are felt while listening to this album, alone in a dark room with headphones, ranges from defeat to triumph. One can realize that they are nothing and still conquer worlds at the same time. If you are a fan of metal buy this album.
0452289963|5.0|Very interesting and helped me deal with a tragic situation I was going through at the time I bought it
145470246X|1.0|Much too complicated, not enough varied designs, definitely for advanced beaders who like a particular style of beadwork.  It just wasn't for me at all..
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I hate when they make a game that is no way closely looks like BINGO.  This game is not even close to BINGO.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Awesome show just awesome. You need season 5 on prime this show is the best thing out. Jax is the man. Samcro.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|Since I don't live life in second increments I wasn't interested in making sure my next watch would keep time perfectly.  After almost a month of wearing this Seiko there's still indistinguishable time difference between what it indicates and the radio-signal &#34;atomic&#34; wall clock in my kitchen shows.  And, I haven't reset it once.  I also like the absence of batteries, and that it is not dependent on electronics to measure time.<br /><br />I like the fact that, like me, it only works well when it moves.  I just keeps ticking along
B000I0QL82|5.0|The stars are at their best and the music is grand. All is not to be topped by the dancing. This film give it all with the greats.
B00EDF43MY|4.0|My daughter is enjoying this new Dr Panda game as much as all the previous ones, though this one is a little more difficult, and she requires my assistance more frequently. I am a bit concerned about the appropriateness of the lighter that is found when going through security. In any case, we will continue to purchase the Dr Panda apps as new ones become available.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|How nice to watch an happy film from beginning to end. It is full of great performances from all of the stars in it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the series, but, was very disappointed that you only show first show for free and then expect us to pay for the rest. I can get it all for free other places, may have to wait a little longer but worth it. Have this free trial for your prime but will cancel.
B0007939NO|5.0|Only love can pull Gene Kelly through it all. The music and dancing is so wonderful while he finds his way to his true love.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I have another USB cable that looks just like this one.  I see no reason that this particular one need be bought for the Kindle.
0307730700|5.0|I've read several books about the Navy Seals.  Until ` Fearless', though  - not wanting to take anything away from those BUD/S grads who managed to make the cut -  the books were beginning to seem a bit clich&eacute;.  Not so with `Fearless' written by Eric Blehm.<br /><br />In all candor, this book was one of the most impactful that I read all summer.  I was moved to laugh, cry, sigh . . . sometimes simultaneously, with profound affection, respect and gratitude for the real-life central character Adam Brown and for his family and friends.<br /><br />I used the word clich&eacute; in my opening paragraph only as a reference to the starting point of so many worthy tales of these fine men.  However, the measure of personal character begins years before the decision is made to attempt membership in this elite fighting force.<br /><br />It's said that the Seals don't build character, they reveal it.  Never was this truer than in the engaging tale chronicled in `Fearless'.  In the case of Adam Brown the adversity in his life prior to entering the Navy  - by his own wayward decision-making - nearly came to define him.  However, through an incredible family and friend(s) support system combined with Devine providence, Adam Brown came to redefine character for his `Self' and those whose lives he touched.<br /><br />Some of us have met folks such as Adam.  He knew only one speed - that is full speed ahead; tough to maintain when wrestling with personal extremes and demons.  This is a deeply personal story of a man who found peace though God and the love of his family, wife and friends. He also paid the ultimate sacrifice.  However, if one is to ask what the meaning of life is, Adam's legacy in his brief life answered the question.  It is simply, to give life meaning.
B0042JH0EE|5.0|High quality sound and video.  Great songs and worth every penny.  A great way to get Motown sound recorded in today's quality.  A fascinating 1 hour story can be seen about the production of this on one of the cable channels.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Graphics are awesome and game challenging. Hopefully more new lands on the way. Balloon ride very cool, much better than Temple Run 2.
B004L35GAQ|4.0|Pop, Rock, Electronic, Hip Hop tied together very well.  Very talented bunch of musicians. How can I get the other exclusive tracks from Apple and Google?
B004IPPINW|5.0|A beautiful narration about the complexities of chosen belief systems. A much enjoyed adventure that seems timeless in relation to the cycles of human nature, geography, and prosperity.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The universe created in this book is so interesting and entertaining, I read this book in 4 or 5 nights before bed and it had me thinking about it all day and for some time after finishing it. This is the most enjoyable book I've read recently, especially as a science fiction fan and guy who enjoys video games. In fact, I think this book gave an even deeper appreciation for video games.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's fun and hard<br />I like playing when board and when nothing to do and its a good game that's free
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is the first time I've purchased and used a gaming mouse, and I'm really impressed by how smooth and responsive it is.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love Adele so I loved this product!  Not sure I have much more to say about this product, listen to it.
B00284G2IA|2.0|I grabbed this hoping for a lossless audio track (as is part of the bluray specification).  Instead, I was presented with a pair of dolby digital compressed soundtracks - a 2.0 at 675 kilobit and a 5.1 at 640 kilobit.<br /><br />By comparison, most DVDs feature a stereo (or prologic) audio track that is encoded as 2.0 at 1,536 kilobit.<br /><br />The end result is a soundtrack that both bright and muddy at the same time.  While the 5.1 track opens the soundspace nicely, the effect on the music is even more pronounced.<br /><br />In short: if you're a collector, nab this.  If you're an audiophile, grab the CDs and walk away slowly.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Really entertaining movie, but this is not for young kids.  I am looking forward to Kick Ass 2!  Enjoy the show.

B005LHO274|5.0|I love this app, but am stuck on how to find my latitude &amp; longitude since the Kindle apparently has no GPS.  They say to try Google. Someone help!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GAME, my two year old and I can get lost playing for hours. I love that it is not too hard for her to play.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Charger worked great despite he fact the receiver is damaged. I had to wrap it around the Kindle but it charged perfectly.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Sure, this is an interesting romantic novel.  But, like the Saturday movies or some TV shows, there is no ending. \\"Continued\\", in next book.  Disgusting !!
B004ZJZQH4|4.0|You know the storyline and I think it's well done. The 'remastering' (not even sure if that was done) could have been better in terms of HD picture and sound.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like the new  format and all this app has to offer. It always seems to be accurate sand up to date and time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book full of details with beautiful imagined imagery in my mind. Mind blowing to the least. My favorite book.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I had watched the series on Netflix and really enjoyed it. The book was more of a diary and more serious. What she learned in prison about her part in the (little) crime she committed and to see first hand the chain reaction her action caused was quite an eye opener for her.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoy playing this when I find some time on my hands.  I must admit I am not real good at it, though.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show.  The whole family watches it and most of my coworkers love it as well.  Its a little gory but the suspense is great.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is a classic, and one which I would mark as recommended reading for anyone.  Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Such an Amazing film! This film was outstanding and is even better than the original one. It's easially 5 stars.

B00000G3PA|1.0|So he goes up to the rock thing and the thing doesn't blow up correctly so he dies THE END
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|Simple plot with an ending that you could see coming.  Good acting by the youngsters, but it didn't seem to move very quickly.
B000CNESU8|5.0|I got this because a compelling scene from it was shown in another movie called &#34;Zietgiest the Movie&#34; which I give my  Highly Recommended rating. This movie, made in 76, looks behind the political scenes of a fictional television &#34;Network.&#34; While watching the story unfold I said to myself &#34;Holy CRAP!! Its no different now!!!&#34; Seriously, over 30 years ago we have the same problems the only difference is the fashions of the 70's... Without spoiling it, the end of The Network is kind of ironic...<br /><br />This movie is a must watch.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|After hearing all the hype about this book, I couldn't wait to start it.  The author is definitely very talented.  His writing style is great.  I actually felt I knew the District Attorney  personally.  However, the book  was a bit wordy.  Too much detail about nothing.  It's a good read but I wasn't blown over.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I thought this was a good story.  Of course, Puller, the hero, could survive almost any catastrophe without a scratch.  The plot was intriguing and hard to predict and the heroine was an interesting and believable character.  It probably told of life in West Virginia in a realistic way -- the mining was king and the environment was not as important as money.  There is an unexpected twist at the end of the story that I particularly liked, and I enjoyed reading the book.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|I can't believe that with this many big names, this movie could suck so bad. The first one was entertaining, but this one, 5 minutes in, we were both on our phones......:-P
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is a lot of fun.  I am hooked.  I have had issues a couple of times getting knocked out of the game.  But they refund your chips to you.  I recommend the game.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits in the kind of show that has enough intrigue, story line and great characters to keep you coming back.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved watching the hunger games, it was a wonderful film exciting. The film showed love anger and sacrifice taking the place for someone you love. My sister's keeper definitely.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This movie is a delight. All the residents of a wonderful old english house are retired professional musicians. The ordinary physical deterioration of old age is dealt with in an open and  gently humorous  manner. The music throughout the movie is mostly classical with the musicians giving lessons to children from the surrounding community. My only regret is that the movie isn't long enough. I would love to hear more of this caliber of music. And the movie is a clear statement that old age although inconvenient does not mean you have nothing valuable to share with others.
0307719774|5.0|Bought this item for my best friend's birthday. He was excited to receive it, and enjoys writing in it everyday. There isn't much room to write for each day but then again it's a five year journal. The book itself would be huge if it had more space.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Of the 3 movies I find this one to be the best. We are avid batman and superman fans and christopher nolan and christian bale are an amazing team!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game its like the only game I ever play I just wish it would stop freezing. I hate that because now I can barely ever play!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Outstanding. A gracious, dignified and respectful homage to a true American hero. Mr. Blehm served Adam's memory beautifully. An inspiration.
B00AEBB86A|4.0|This was a very suspenseful movie and well-acted by old and new actors. It was a movie I saw with my son on July fourth at his home and I'd never heard of it. It was good to know it was available through Amazon.com
B0098R6M1M|4.0|It is subtitled. It moved rather slowly, but the story is sweet and there are a few good laughs.  I'm glad I watched it.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|i am actually using the item. I can guarantee that is good quality, a few late the reception but is exelent, I agree. Thanks
B008602KQI|5.0|Lots of action in this movie.  The actors were very good as well.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B000FCKC4C|1.0|Why has this book won awards and accolades??? I'm flummoxed by that.  It is contrived, pointless (we've all heard this life lesson a million times before), and simplistically written (perhaps style was lost in translation).  It was a book club &#34;must&#34; - all I can say is I'm glad it was short.
0307950654|1.0|This was a very poor attempt to jump on the Austen meal train and she should have been ejected at the first stop. Stilted dialogue, a tedious amount of superfluous detail  and endless rehashing of events from P&P offers up a big Who Cares once all is revealed.  Had she not ripped off the characters and setting from Austen, doubt anyone would be reading it.  While it is too bad that Austen only wrote six novels, this type of nonsense does not really fill the breech.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Ok, go with me here.  I know my title sounds dramatic but it's true.  I ordered the rest of the trilogy of books after the first chapter.<br />You will love Drew, or you will hate him, but secretly still love him.<br />He is a true man and you come to understand him in ways that no other book has ever let you understand a man.<br />And Kate is a strong, smart, sexy, vulnerable woman.  Not some wishy washy typical romance novel woman.<br /><br />You have to read this book and I promise, you won't be sorry.  Do you hear me, I promise.  So get a glass of your favorite beverage, sit in your favorite chair and prepare to fall in love with this book, Drew and Kate. You'll be so glad you did!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy playing the game I look forward to playing daily. The game is fun and competetive I would like more credits daily to play longer.
B008I43DYU|5.0|It is easy to see and manipulate the buttons.  Very handy on my Kindle when I need to quickly calculate
B0036FYO12|5.0|I had seen the movie many years ago and watched it with a friend (their first time).  Redford is perfect and the movie as poignant today as it was when first released.
B0076DELIG|5.0|If anything happened to me I would want Harry Bosch on the case. He is relentless, not always by the book either. Connelly has created a multifaceted character. I hope the DROP never happens.
B000002G0P|4.0|love this cd and its almost as good as pornograffiti.  I wish they still put out albums like this.  Nuno is a beast
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|\\"I read this for just a short read. But on the plane I was in love. With Augustus waters and the book. When Gus died I died too. I cried for 2 hours because I felt a connection with hazel Grace and Augustus.\\"
B000002GJ7|5.0|One of the best rock albums ever.  If you like 80's rock or metal and shred guitar this album should be on your short list.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is a very happy, moving and sad story all in one. It made reading actually enjoyable for me.<br /><br />The story appeals to both young and old. It's about a ten year old boy, August, with severe facial deformities. August goes through some tough times. He has been home schooled until 5th grade so starting private school is one of his greatest challenges. Will kids like him or make fun of him? I can relate to starting a new school which is hard enough without the physical deformities that August had to deal with. He is a very likable, brave kid. With the love from his family and new friends he made it through the school year even though not everyone accepted him.<br /><br />I think everyone should read this book. It's a good reminder that looks aren't everything in a person, and we should treat each other how we want to be treated.<br /><br />T. Wilkins
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Brutal at times but also with a lot funny moments. It's long, but stick with it, you'll be glad you did.
0812993845|1.0|This book is really horrible. I had a hard time even finishing it.  I feel like I wasted my time and money on this book.  Yes, there are some Sophie Kinsella jokes and funny moments, but these did not save the fact the plot was ridiculous, unrealistic, and terrible.  I am surprised I finished the book, parts of the book were painful to read.  I do not recommend this book. I have enjoyed other Sophie Kinsella books, but this one if I could take back my time and money I would.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is a wonderful family movie with many humorous parts and much to recommend its approach to generational relations.  I don't buy many videos but I bought this because it is so well done and the theme is so useful to connect members of a family.
0385737955|5.0|I couldn't put the book down, it was so suspenseful and kept me wanting more. It was a very good book with well developed characters.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|The case was reasonable and very nice. I would recommend this to anyone with a kindle fire. Very lightweight and convenient.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|Couldn't even finish . In my reading career I've only not been able to finish two books and this is one of them .this book had no plot what so ever and had me bored the whole time .<br /><br />It's a good movie to watch but not a good book to read .
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This is a feel good story.  The style is easy and you get drawn in from the first page.  It is absolutely unbelievable but the twists and turns take you on a joyful ride.  I found myself thinking about the movie 'The Gods must be crazy' as I read.  It is the same sort of wry slapstick comedy.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a great game....you can play many times...it's easy and Free....so let's go...play and have fun...you'il love This game because it'<br />very easy but funny
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I am currently reading all of Mr. Connelly's Harry Bosch novels in order.  I love the characters, the plot and all of his books are always a fast read for me. Never the obvious and always a twist somewhere.  I love these books.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Best game they made so far!So much fun and addicting, a lot  better than the other games!Keep just the good work!
B000IZJ1KC|5.0|If you love Heavy Metal you will love this album. This band consists of various members of other famous metal groups (Gorgoroth, Enslaved and Immortal). While all those bands are of a darker strain of metal (black metal namely), this album is straight out heavy metal at its finest. If you are a black metal fan or a fan of the named bands above, this album may not be for you. Abbath (the singer) keeps his black metal style of vocalization, but gone from this album is the erratic and noisy, fast paced, musical structure of black metal and introduced are composed and thought out structured songs. Each song is strong from beginning to end.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this album, is after hearing the bonus tracks that are not on this album, I am dissapointed that those other three songs were not included on this album. They are three gems that are missing from this cd for whatever foolish reason.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|First, a quick recap: Chromecast is a $35 streaming dongle that plugs into your TV's HDMI port. You can use it to stream online videos from YouTube, Netflix and elsewhere, and use your computer, mobile phone or tablet as a remote control. It doesn't have any kind of separate app store or user interface on your TV - everything gets controlled from the PC or mobile device. The key word here is control: Your phone doesn't stream videos directly to your Chromecast dongle. Instead, it just tells the device which video it should stream from the cloud. That means that you can use your phone for something else, or even turn it off, once the stream starts. This kind of remote control capability only works with apps and sites that directly support Chromecast. In addition to that, users can also stream any web content directly from their computer's Chrome browser, as long as they have a special Chrome extension installed.<br /><br />I set up Chromecast three times: First, with a unit loaned from Google in my office, then with the same device at home and finally with a Chromecast I bought for my own use. Doing so taught me that the setup can be remarkably easy if you follow Google's directions and download the setup app on your computer or mobile device. I chose to ignore these recommendations, tried to set up the device with my Nexus 7's Chrome browser and got stuck. Go figure. But enough of the complaining. Just get those apps, and the setup is literally done in two minutes. Just plug the dongle into your TV, connect it to a power source (I'd recommend not using your TV's USB port but the extra charger that comes with the device; more on that later.) and fire up the app on your computer or mobile device. Enter the password of your local Wi-Fi network, and you're all set.<br /><br />Chromecast is a great device for Netflix viewing: Streams look as good as on any other device I've tested, and I actually found that navigating the Netflix catalog on my computer or mobile device worked much better for me than on a connected device. Also cool: A friend of mine came over, took out her iPhone, connected to our Wi-Fi network, and streamed something to our TV using her Netflix account. No complicated account switching was necessary. It's a small thing, but the fact that the dongle isn't tied to a single Netflix account makes it a whole lot easier to enjoy movie night with friends. The one feature I missed from Netflix on Chromecast was the same kind of post-play experience Netflix is now offering on other devices. The next episode of a show doesn't start automatically, forcing you to instead bust out your phone again and manually select what to watch next.<br /><br />The other major use case for Chromecast right now is YouTube, and I streamed my fair share of videos from that site in the last few weeks as well. Overall, streaming worked once again really well, and even more than with Netflix, I quickly found this setup to work much better for my needs than YouTube's TV app on other connected devices. I did find a few things that YouTube could do to improve the experience. First, beaming videos to Chromecast from your PC is currently only supported if you are on YouTube.com, and not if the video is embedded in a third-party website. That means that even on Google+, you need to click through to YouTube.com before you can start watching on the big screen. Also, YouTube's mobile app currently has a neat feature that allows you to add videos to a queue of things to be played next on TV, something that you can even do with multiple devices at the same time - think YouTube party. However, there's no support to queue up videos from the Chrome browser yet. In one or two cases, I ran into issues of videos giving me \\"unsupported video format\\" error messages, but overall, playback was pretty smooth. I even played back an entire VOD movie from YouTube.com via Chromecast without any issues - and this was the first time it really made sense to me to pay for a video on YouTube.<br /><br />As mentioned before, Chromecast does offer the ability to stream a tab from your PC's Chrome browser straight to your TV. This is similar to screen sharing in a teleconference, meaning that the browser captures everything in a new video - something that is quite resource-intensive, and even on my 2012 Macbook Pro led to a few performance warnings when streaming video. The idea behind this screencasting feature is to enable you to stream anything that's not available through a native app yet. I tried it with a few Hulu streams, and while it worked, it definitely degraded the quality to a more VHS-like experience, complete with a few skips every now and then. I found that it worked well enough to watch animated fare like the Simpsons, but that it was a bit too painful for shows I'd rather watch in HD on a Hulu Plus-capable device. I also tried to play a few local videos by simply dropping them onto the Chrome browser tab, and experienced similar mixed results. This may be acceptable if you don't have any other way to get local videos onto the TV, but it's definitely not great, which is why Google still calls this feature beta. Luckily, there are a number of apps in the works that will enable you to play local content without compromising on picture quality. I did on occasion use the browser-based streaming to listen to music from Rdio.com via the browser, which was far less taxing on my Macbook, and the Rdio player actually looked quite nice on the TV. However, even with this, I occasionally encountered some weird glitches, including changes in tempo for a second or two.ideo on YouTube.<br /><br />As mentioned before, Chromecast does offer the ability to stream a tab from your PC's Chrome browser straight to your TV.

B0030DIP7O|5.0|Admittedly it is hard to give a unbiased review as I am a huge fan of Scorpions. Whether it is the Schenker bros. era, Uli Roth, Matthias Jabs or other in the later years, I love Scorpions.<br /><br />One aspect that definitely stands out right away is the bands all out rock structure. The Uli Roth era of Scorpions is more of a balls to the wall, unpolished, psychedelic rock (ie. &#34;Backstage Queen&#34; and &#34;Hell Cat&#34;) as opposed to the harmonic and melodic twin guitar, structured songs that would later become their signature in rock music, (however early hints into the direction the band would go are on songs like &#34;We'll Burn the Sky,&#34; &#34;Top of the Bill&#34; and, &#34;Riot of Your Time&#34;).<br /><br />The only real dissapointment is the sound quality of the recordings. The albums themselves are awesome. IF you can get past the fact that these thre albums are prior to them finding the sound that would make them famous, and you dig the MIchael Schenker years (when they were more of a fusion of jazz/rock), then you will love these albums. It is also refreshing to have these albums if you love the composition team of Rudolf Schenker and Klaus Meine. It is nice to play, Lonesome Crow, In Trance, Taken By Force, Animal Magnetism, Love At First Sting, and Crazy World, and hear how the band changed and grew in their songwriting over the years.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I have been hoping for a book like this for a long time. This history of the time of Jesus compares scripture to historical facts and does a great job at piecing together the history of the actual man as best as can be done 2000 years later.  The author has distilled all the best research into one readable book.  Still, there are so many names and dates to contend with that it can be hard to follow, but work through those parts for the rest is really interesting and gave me a much better understanding of the circumstances of those years and how the New Testament was developed the way it was.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love how you can set different levels for sleep and wake volume. And again, being able to choose what songs you fall asleep to and what you want to wake to independently is a nice feature.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Entertaining at times, but often hard to follow and keep track of who's who (good vs. evil).  There were a few unresolved events that left you wondering in the end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very much fun and very challenging.  I have had children of all ages play it with me and they all seem to enjoy it
1781162646|4.0|Joyland reminds me of King's early works--short, descriptive, and compelling. Like other reviewers, some of his longer, in-depth narrative books, sometimes overwhelmed me. The book is less than 300 pages, but as the plot developed, and I became more familiar with main players, I sometimes found myself wanting more character development and more detail. Oh, Mr. King, you know how to taunt your readers! I read the book in three sittings, and, when I put it down at midnight, I had to say I was 100% satisfied with Joyland.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Django Unchained was the best western I've seen in over a decade. It wasn't lame. Finally I feel like I have a western movie from my generation that rivals those from when my dad was my age.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Harold and Maude is my all time favorite movie.  I've seen it so many times I can't count.  Good acting, touching, funny story and an overall great movie.<br /><br />Arlene Young
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a very well-told and unusual love story between a quadriplegic and his caregiver.  Louisa Clark's character is beautifully drawn as a young, jobless and uneducated woman who becomes employed by a wealthy family to care for their son who was paralyzed in an accident. Their relationship is central to the novel and it is developed slowly. but with believability. The story is compelling and I stayed up late to finish it. It made me realize how difficult the world is for those in a wheelchair, but also how important the dignity of life is.  I would highly recommend this book.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I had to buy it as soon as I saw she had released a new one. Her best album yet, loved every song on it.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The story held my interest because I liked the characters and the premise of the novel-that a man would take a long and arduous journey for a woman who was dying of cancer. It dragged in some places, but overall I thought it was well-written and interesting.
B008JFLWLE|4.0|Works very well but does not recognize some figures/symbols and not programmed for others - more scientific related capability needed
B00B7ERH04|5.0|took a while to figure out how to use the camera, but once I did, I was very pleased! It is a lot of fun. The pictures turn out great. Going back to view the pictures was easier than I thought it would be. This is an awesome feature on the kindle fire hd.

B00ECUARO8|4.0|I've always enjoyed Mathew McConaughley and he did not dissapoint in &#34;Mud&#34; either. However, the young boy in the movie who plays Ellis is the star of the movie. This movie has drama, suspense, action and even a love story. Even my husband, the movie critic, enjoyed this one.

B009HEN9DU|2.0|This is one of my favorite incarnations of the three musketeers. it is a great movie and is all around fun to watch.... however, the streaming quality is lacking ( I think the audio may have been dubbed)as the sound refuses (i tried everything to fix it) to line up with the video. I have a high speed connection, so i dont think connectivity had anything to do with my problem... this is disappointing to say the least.

B003LQ3YXU|3.0|I tried to watch a few episodes and it just wouldn't stick. I really wanted to like the show since there are so many episodes to watch on Amazon. The special effects are a little over the top, but it was filmed a while ago. I may try to watch again soon.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is such a fun game to play!  I recommend this to everyone who likes brain teasers. Great time waster!
B00782O7NE|5.0|When you have no audible dialogue and the images are black & white, you need good cinematography to make it work.  I saw this movie when it first came out and wanted to get this copy to re-watch and review for improving my cinematography skills.  Well done for the most part, although there are sections of the movie that could have been cut to make it shorter without losing the story.  Still well done and I have watched twice already and will now study in depth for shot angles, and use of aesthetics.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|thanks a lot for a great deal, i am so happy with these, so fast so good attention, big deal for me
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Great to hear Rock of Paul as it was in 1972 . The British invasion had passed and Buddy Holly left the country music spinning out if control till Wings came along with the true soul of rolling melodies we could relate and sing back to our radios that we heard the good word of western man. And-but  if you were 16 to 21 years old in early 1970 you would remember what love was meant to be, because Wings was Peace during War.<br />Every car radio in my group of friends listened to these songs and cared about Peace, and Love  and important values in growing up healthy young adults.
B007SGM084|5.0|E. L. You should have started writing sooner. I believe women by the millions have just begun to awaken their libidos via reading this spicy love story. I am 44, but suddenly feeling nostalgic about being 15,  in love or at least lust again. Thanks for the butterflies, the reconnect with my spouse and the tender story of Christian fifty shades freed via true love with the beguiling Anastasia. Keep writing!

(If you bypass registration it sucks up power like a Hoover!  Charge doesn't last very long as it goes through B&N registration cycle in the background regardless if wi-fi is on or off.)<br /><br />2. You MUST tie a credit card to your B&N account or you can't buy anything including FREE books!<br /><br />3. If you decide to \\"manually\\" load books via USB, realize you have only 250mb of space for this purpose!  (The advertised 2GB IS DECEPTIVE.  The bulk of the \\"space\\" is reserved for \\"B&N content\\" and purchases that you make only from B&N.)<br /><br />4.  No PASSWORD PROTECTION OPTION to secure your device.  Lose your nook and the thief can buy up stuff at B&N on your dime.<br /><br />5.  No text to speech options.<br /><br />6.  No audio files allowed (mp3, etc.)<br /><br />7.  Wi-Fi only, no independent 3g/Internet access.<br /><br />8.  Slow response and \\"typing\\" is cumbersome with virtual keyboard.<br /><br />9.  You CAN'T read any books you've purchased elsewhere unless they are open format and again good luck with that whopping 250mb of space!<br /><br />10. Once you create a B&N account, it is a pain in the butt to try to delete it.  You have to call and beg them to lose your information and delete the account.  You CAN'T do it yourself, it isn't even an option.<br /><br />================<br />The ONLY pluses:<br /><br />The device has an SD card slot to load books in epub or pdf format (but even this is tedious and fraught with problems.)<br /><br />It's small (but cases are cheap quality AND overpriced).

B00CNEVHMG|5.0|I have the cd, the SACD and the 180 gram blue vinyl edition. The SACD version conveys more of the music and is the superior format. I heard instruments and harmonies that I had not detected before. If you have a SACD player, buy the SACD version.
B004KPQK2S|2.0|Secretariat was the greatest racehorse ever, but it's story, set as at a time where racing was not as basic or brutal as the 1930's (which makes things interesting),  is just not as good as Seabiscut's. I found it hard to  bond with the characters.  I think the lack of story made it nearly impossible to make a good film and the attempt to make things interesting just didn't suit me. Not a lot of characters to like in the film, none memorable.  I found myself skipping forward more and more and just gave up.  I think if they had concentrated on the grace and beauty of horse racing (Secretariat's spectacular career was so short that there weren't any real ups and downs to make a compelling story)  it would have been a much better film, similar to how they did the film Gran Prix in the 60's, it would have been much better.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I really like the cushioning inside, Good to use to protect my Kindlefire when I take it out of the house.  Very sturdy.
0316228583|5.0|Loved being in the small town with all the intricately woven characters.  Vocabulary was different and much more interesting that most books I've read.  Would definitely recommend it.  Left it in Thailand with a newly wed couple for their enjoyment after I finished reading it.  Definitely recommend it.  I really enjoyed J. K. Rowling's first attempt at adult fiction.

B0084AXZK0|5.0|I was surprised by this book as I did not know that Oscar Wilde wrote this sort of crime/psychological novels. Very entertaining. I must admit that I skipped a few pages, where mr. Wilde, true to his Century, gave detailed descriptions of matters my generation have no idea about. This aside, I really recommend this book!

B00DQVST76|5.0|The MDNA tour was the most exciting night of my life. I was honoured of be in the Golden Triangle and to be surrounded by \\"M's\\"brilliance. The show starts off with the 'Act of Contrition' then jumps into 'Girl Gone Wild'. When she does a blind back flip into her dancers then proceeds to do a sick breakdown of the song leading her twenty something dancers on a journey through 21 more songs... Well, at that point she could do no wrong. I was so mesmerized that I went back for seconds. If I could, I would have attended every show. Pure brilliance from darkness to light then back again. Fierce, brave, compelling, current, spectacular!!! Pure Madonna at her best! There's only one Queen, and that's MADONNA.... Bitch!!!!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Awesome game. Best game ever<br />I love it so much . It's so addicting. The quality of the game is so good.
B000FC1K66|5.0|This fascinating tale induces moral reflection and exposure to unusual patterns of thinking, reasoning, and acting. The Reader's unusual structure keeps the reader enticed while simultaneously estranging them from the book in order to keep the reader in reality just enough to contemplate it's messages. The Reader scores numerous social and logical pathways concerning behavior including love, infatuation, loyalty, the affects of maturing members of a relationship on said relationship, alienation, duty, moral responsibility, and devotion. This book is simultaneously fascinating, morally reflective, and moving. I would recommend that this book be read by all individuals who want more than a simple story from a work of literature.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I thought this book was about nothing, but it was about everything. Ellen cracks me up. Glad I purchased it!

B004KPX4W2|5.0|See this one before you see Red 2.  Well worth it.  funny, great cast portraying great characters.  don't miss the second one.
B00DYZ2YVG|5.0|A great zombie romp. Set in the idyllic welsh valleys, something that gives this book a very unique feel, and featuring an unlikely hero. An unassuming, average Joe thrust into an apocalyptic disaster and rising quite admirably to the occasion. Great zombie concepts that entwine the different styles of 28 Days Later's \\"Infected\\" with Romero's shuffling dead. Great characters and fast action scenes. If you ever find yourself trapped and surrounded by zombies with no hope of escape, starve of that last bullet; at least until you've read the Undead Valleys that is.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So many twists and turns in this season of the incredible, Downton Abbey and with the addition of Shirley MacLaine, one can only hang on for so long until Season 4 arrives in January.  If you loved the first two, you'll love Season 3.

B004A8ZWVK|1.0|I was so disappointed with this movie. The book was so wonderful, and when we saw the movie, my husband was disappointed because I kept pointing out all the stuff that was left out. There was so much missing. They tried to get things in there - like the white lady serving a coke to the black servant, but my husband didn't catch the great meaning - which comes through in the book, but of course never in the movie. So why even include that in the movie? Anyway, i would never recommend this to movie to someone who can read.

B00CWV8TIU|2.0|SIDE EFFECTS (2013) has three main characters who look very nice on the outside, appear to be very nice on the inside, but may not be all they seem. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Jude Law play the parts of a couple psychiatrists, and Rooney Mara plays the part of a depressed woman who was first Zeta-Jones' patient and then Law's patient. And the medication that Law prescribes to Mara turns out to have dangerous side effects, which may include sleep-walking ... and sleep-cooking ... AND apparently much much more.<br /><br />Progressing quite slowly, SIDE EFFECTS keeps us in suspense for more than half its length as to WHAT kind of film it really is - an expos&eacute; of the drug industry? a psychological thriller? a murder mystery? a revenge tale? or ... ?<br /><br />Then, once it becomes clear just what has taken place, the film's wheels begin to come loose ... and by the ending, all the wheels fall off.<br /><br />We ask ourselves things like \\"WHY did Catherine Zeta-Jones' character do that really stupid thing to Jude Law's character?\\" \\"HOW did Jude Law's character ever begin to see daylight just by spending a couple days on the Internet?\\" \\"WHAT made him think he was on the right track?\\" and \\"WHY would Zeta-Jones' character believe what Jude Law's character is telling her?\\"<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT* - Then, at the end, after Jude Law's character has found a way to destroy the mind of a patient who lied to him, we ask ourselves things like \\"What about his HIPPOCRATIC OATH as a doctor, let alone his integrity and honor as a human being?\\" and \\"Now that he has almost turned her into a vegetable, HOW is she going to testify at the trial of her accomplice?\\"<br /><br />The main problem is with the SCRIPT: besides multiple plot holes, it is riddled with massively faulty morality. And the audience apparently is expected to root for and admire the winner at the end of a Dog-Eat-Dog contest. I'm reminded of a parallel case: a disgusting short mystery story by Colin Dexter in which his Inspector Morse and Sgt. Lewis, otherwise very honorable and lovable characters, both connive to FABRICATE FALSE EVIDENCE against a man they cannot honestly and lawfully convict.<br /><br />If I were giving this movie a letter grade, in my judgment it deserves a low \\"D\\", perhaps even a \\"D-\\". And why not an \\"F\\"?<br /><br />Well, despite the seriously flawed script, Rooney Mara's performance as a many-faceted person is quite good, and the film DOES provide us with a mildly interesting PUZZLE to piece together, despite its totally wretched conclusion. To draw another comparison, I'm also reminded of an old joke in which a house guest is given breakfast that includes an egg which was turning bad; he politely eats all of it, and when asked how it was, he replies, \\"Parts of it were quite good!\\"Inspector Morse and Sgt.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great series, which captures your interest from the very beginning and you can't wait until the next show.  I watched it on Amazon Prime free on my iPad while I was traveling.  I recommend it to anyone!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|When the movie was originally released, I was unable to see it.  I watched it three times in the first two weeks after I received the DVD's.  Thank you for making this kind of entertainment available.
B005FITIK0|5.0|The movie is an okay plot; however, Charlize Theron is able to take the story to a higher level because of her talent.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|Slightly more erudite than just pushing buttons though, or so I'm assuming because I've never gotten into the game playing  thing, so I'm giving it a great deal of credit here. But certainly, just as in reading, the imagination can be engaged in whatever you're doing. But this writer gives any nerd with no life everything he could possibly want, written in the first person, a character who is simply superior to every other living creature around, while remaining remarkably modest, he vanquishes even Some in the pantheon of the Gods, that apparently need to be vanquished anyway. His best friend is a dog, with whom, (like everyone else) he has perfect communication and the best and most satisfying relationship. This relationship is only slightly challenged by the relationships he shares with his lawyer (an ancient vampire) and his other lawyer (a werewolf), and all of the Goddesses, or Goddesslike women he finds the time to bed, wilst not slaying bad guys, or preparing to slay them. Creepy right? To only have a dog and 2 morphing monster lawyers as your best friends? Well he's the only true Druid left in the world, and he's ancient, so I guess it's appropriate. Like so much of what's popular nowadays, we are asked to suspend more and more of our disbelief. What's actually true isn't quite fantastic enough for us, I suppose. But hey, don't get me wrong, I'm not dissing the genre. I've long been a huge Sci-Fi fan. I guess I like my Science a little more solid, and my fantasy a little less frilly. But um, I also talked to my dogs a lot too. But they just were never Polyslabs, like this one.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well, all I can say about this book other than it was awesome & can't wait to read the rest, is that I would suggest that your other half be in a close proximity when you are reading this book. It took me forever to get thru it due to the graphic content, and my other half was very happy while I was reading this book. Kept me intrigued for sure!

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Great show and still running on tv I don't watch it as much anymore but when it came out I did
0316044695|5.0|This book is a quick read for two reasons. First, after getting through the preliminaries, the authors keep you on the edge of your seat for the remainder of the tale. Second, the language is simple. Luttrell has a story to tell and it is told well. He explains why he thinks so highly of himself and his fellow SEALs by detailing the experiences of his brutal Naval training and then takes the reader directly to Afghanistan for a few missions before getting into the meat of the book, which is about a firefight between four U.S. soldiers and 100-200 Taliban soldiers. Three of the four U.S. soldiers died. Gobs of Taliban died. This is a phenomenal tale. My only gripe is regarding the extensive use of bad language. While this is a reality of service in the military, I find it an unnecessary overkilled additive for an otherwise fine book. This book is not for the queasy, but most military men will love it. One part I particularly appreciated was when Luttrell blasts the liberal media for unwittingly playing a part military decisions. He makes it clear that the liberal media played a key role in the deaths of his three comrades in arms.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Great show and still running on tv I don't watch it as much anymore but when it came out I did
0307744434|5.0|Night Circus is well-written, with gorgeous descriptions of a magical circus that only comes out a night. The circus exists as a venue for two magic apprentices to enter a contest of will and power, and is an amazing setting. Outside of the circus, the book takes place largely in London in the late nineteen century.<br /><br />The characters are well-developed, and the romance is very old-school romance... Celia and Marco (the lovers) can't be together due to outside circumstances (their family, a magic contest).. Will love win in the end? It's a testatment to the author that I honestly wasn't sure.<br /><br />The plot moves along slowly but steadily. While the story generally moves forward, there are chapters that take place a year or two before the current main storyline. It works, and made for a more interesting read.<br /><br />Recommended to fans of fantasy, atypical romances, and individuals who like long and pretty descriptive paragraphs.
0783225482|5.0|I saw this a long time ago and just had to own in my collection of movies love the movie
0307946711|4.0|One Day is a good drawn-out romance. The timing was just never right for a real relationship between Emma and Dexter-- until suddenly it was. More than the romance though, this book is about growing up and lifelong friendships. They aren't always best friends, but they will always find their way back to each other. Taking place one day a year for a period spanning two decades, One Day has strong writing to support a great premise.<br /><br />One Day is recommended for fans of Nick Hornsby. Strangely enough, it reminded me of a British 1980s/90s version of The Way We Were so I'd suggest it to anyone who loved that film as well.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This was a Christmas gift to my mother in law she really like this TV show so I had to go ahead get it for.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I'm not normally into Sci-Fi stories, films, etc., but I watched this movie not too long ago and was pleasantly surprised. This movie had that 'adventure' feel to it that has been missing from most movies now a days and it kept my attention. The supporting cast is a treat to watch if you're a fan like me and it was nice to see the main characters as leads. Great adventure story, good lines, and the special effects are pretty cool. I liked the movie so much I downloaded the book! Really, I have no idea why it was such a box office failure. There are so many people who enjoyed the movie and were compelled to write a review like me. Take a chance and check it out.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|Viktor Frankl provides a framework for living an authentic life:  reduce your needs to the bare minimum, accept that life is what it is with all its trials and tribulations and enjoy each day for its potential.  It is a sad commentary on the human condition that we fail to live in the present moment, but have unrealistic expectations of what life is.

B00EFNXPFK|5.0|There are some bands or artists that you love enough to buy every album they release for life. For me, John Mayer is one of those. I bought this one like I bought the last one like I bought the last one and on and on.<br /><br />It is not Heavier Things, it is definitely not Room for Squares. It is different and it is just as good as those were. I can appreciate the Jazz/Country/Blues experimentation. Looking forward to the tour this summer! Glad the guy got healthy; he has not done a show down here in 3 years.

I am disappointed that Evernote does not offer a native Linux application, but the Google Chrome browser extension plugs that hole somewhat and this app can thus synchronize the notes entered on any of my other computers.  No issues whatsoever.  Its one of those apps that &#34;just works&#34;.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I didn't go to see this in the movies because I was afraid that it would be another stupid love story in space!  It did borrow from Independence Day, The Matrix, etc. but it did have enough unique qualities that I didn't feel ripped off.  I loved it so much that I may buy it and add it to my small collection of digital movie purchases.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|It's probably true that most of the movies that Anthony Hopkins has a role in will be worthwhile watching, and this movie is no exception. Bad movies usually suffer from little or no character development and so we don't give a damn what happens to them. Not so here. Huge character development with the main players and an incredible job done by Bart the bear. The plot is simple but near genius  and it's not just about bear confrontations either. The cinematography is outstanding and the ending is huge. Really quite emotional. This is one that you can watch over and over.....a classic.

0345803485|2.0|I usually enjoy erotic novels that make me think and feel a certain way. This book was a complete dissapointment!! I started reading the first book and i haven't even finished it becuase its so bad!!! The author's inspiration was obviously a 15 yr old girl's daydream. I don't like writing bad reviews, becuase i'm a writer myself and i understand the pressure and fear of negative critic, but this was really really bad.<br /><br />I like the book to a certain degree, i believe the author was going somewhere with this story and initally had a good plot thought out, but i'm over the romance bs. \\"Mr. Gray\\" is high untouchable billionare that looks like the gods sculpted him out of marble that falls for a woman that is awkward and--oh wait for it, the shocker--she's coincidentally a virgin and never been kissed! (This idea was cute when Drew Barrymore did the movie over 10 yrs ago!) Then we start to see how his heart skips a beat everytime he sees her and doesn't understand why. He's big and mysterious, has women sign some contract in order to have sex, but on the other hand we have Ana that falls for him and tells herself that he's out of her league and they live in two different worlds but they can't deny the connection and spark between them, blah blah blah....the only twist here is that the guy is into S&M and even that isn't enough to keep my interest!!<br /><br />The entire thing could've been written to be a lot better, i'm gonna try to finish reading the series without poking my eyes out for 1 reason only: a good friend of mine bought the series for me.<br /><br />i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone honestly. turn away and run!!

B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|As a long time devotee of Tolkien, I was looking forward to this release.  However, when i learned that it would be stretched over three movies I was concerned.  After seeing the first, my fears were well founded. The story was lost in all of thefluff needed to fill out three times three hours. Buried under all of the wasted special effexts, there is still a solid story.  But what could easily have made a great three hour movie, will now deliver three mediocre movies.....what a shame!

B004GTLFNW|4.0|I am from India.I bought this book along with the DVDs on my iOS devices and it is a good physical training guide with simplicity.<br />And most important part is that it can be done with all your household things!<br />Its effective as I have started doing it and lost wt.....offcource its not easy at the begining and you feel like quitting many times<br />specially when all your worked out muscles are soar and are in pain....but if you continue doing it ...you are rewarded !<br />Only one missing topic is some more specific nutriton tips as per different body types and cultures ...IMO...
0691126658|5.0|bought the book for a once in a lifetime trip to east Africa.  Found out that this is the book that all the guides and safari company's have and use.  Book was easy to use, descriptions matched behavior of the birds we saw.  Able to find everything we were able to glass well and get a good look at. Only the little brown birds, LBBs couldn't be determined but that is not the fault of the book
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This season is filled with heart pounding and blood racing scenes.  No pun intended.  If you are a true Dexter fan, plan on watching this season from start to finish over a couple of days.  You won't want to turn it off.
1419705849|5.0|My grandson loves the Wimpy kid books.  He has read them all.  My friends grandchildren loved reading this series too.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was expecting the end as this was announced as triology, but now there is two more to come. stroy line was ok I guess, some parts were good others not so. suddenly I found myself in the middle of all this other caracters that are not so related to the story. Maybe they should get a book on their own instead of occuping this one. little disapointed here
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|I do not know what can be done about Echoes. I have the Meddle LP/CD, but the greatest renditions of this \\"song\\" were in England. Live. Sometimes well over an hour. Deep in the night. I love the rest of Meddle, too, but Echoes is signature. If you have not bought Meddle, then you should.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am so inthralled with the whole series! Such an interesting Era to have lived in. Can't wait for Season 4 to start!
B00000IMTE|5.0|I saw Rainbow live not long after the group formed. They were fronting for Kansas. Blackmore and Rainbow performed almost two hours. Blackmore put on such a show of guitar brilliance that it was unreal and brought Hendrix to mind. Then Kansas appeared and started playing their slop. Within minutes, more than half of the audience walked out. I was one of them. Maybe that was not polite of us, but Kansas was total crap compared to Rainbow and it made no sense to stick around.
B004LWZW8I|3.0|I love movies of this genre. And after seeing the previews I was very much anticipating this film. Sadly it fell far short of the hype. The acting wasn't too bad and even the storyline isn't bad it's just the whole feel of this one. It's a Clash of the Titans/300 wannabe. And it doesn't come close, especially to 300. It's just a lame attemp of a film trying to cash in on the coat tails of those other two. I won't say don't watch it but I'd rent it before buying.
B004ZN9NCY|3.0|I do not think this is one of The Pink Floyd's best efforts, and you can tell how old of a fan I am since I do not call the group Pink Floyd but The Pink Floyd. At any rate, I played Careful With That Axe Eugene a few years ago when my kids were in their late teens. It scared the living crud out of them. It frightened me, also. This album is worth the price for that tune alone. Then you can cower in the corner with the rest of us, wondering about how something like that could happen. Good Lord. But play it super loud, since that will add more fear.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I chose this rating because of how much I think about the show when I'm not watching.  That is how I judge my TV.  It is right up there with West Wing, LOST, and FRINGE for me.<br /><br />I love how smart the writing is, while retaining moments of humor.  You care deeply for the characters.  While some shows are pretty intense, they tend to space them out well with story development episodes.<br /><br />I would recommend to people who like smart and funny shows involving law or politics.  For example, I love West Wing, and I dove all into this show after the pilot!  Watching it for free without commercials on Amazon is a huge bonus.
B004ZN9YNC|4.0|Not Now John is a riot; it roars with wild distortion and is smashmouth rock at its best. The Final Cut is one of the first holophonic (acoustic hologram) records ever produced. It may be one of the last, too, since you will not hear what is going on unless you listen through Stax earspeakers (big money) or a super high end set of 2-channel speakers (unreal money). I first heard this recording through a pair of Beveridge floorspeakers in an expensive store in Ohio. The music seemed to be visual as well as auditory. Then I bought The Final Cut and played it through my fairly good ADS speakers. Duh. But then I played it through my Stax, and that was better. I took a star off this rating because, in spite of the technological breakthrough, some of the tracks were not very good.
B000063DFN|5.0|I can't fault this album. It sounds like Iron Maiden. I like Iron Maiden and this is their best album (maybe tied with Piece Of Mind, they're about the same for me.) It rocks and it has memorable riffs, atmospheric bits and yes, THE Bruce Dickinson. It has the chug-chugga-chug-chugga-chug triplet thing. So yeah, it's perfect. All killer no filler as they say.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|This LP was on the charts for a jillion weeks. It is a landmark in modern music. If you do not own it, buy it. Then turn your amp and preamp so high that your massive, high end floorspeakers almost explode in flames. That is my advice. But keep your fire extinguisher close, just in case.
B009LXECF6|3.0|except for 2 songs on the track ..I was disappointed...I wanted to hear more good songs like he does when performing on TV.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is fast paced fun game.  I would recommend that everyone try it...my friends turned me on to the game and now I'm addicted.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice calculator, handy on your kindle. No problems with it so far. I recommend this app. Of course ads at top but not to bad. Not distracting in any way.
B007AL48UK|5.0|This is a blast!  I can hardly stop playing to do something else!  It is challenging, but not too much so.  Love the speed and the ability to play different games with out having to go home and open it again!  I highly recommend it to everyone who loves to play Mahjong!  I especially like the option of reshuffling the tiles when there  no moves available!  5 STARS!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Having fun shooting everything in sight. Would recommend it for first person shooter games. Cheap entertainment for teens and adult fans with goals along the storyline.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|It was what you expected it to be. I enjoyed it all. Loved that it was free on my prime membership.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|The cord separated at the part that plugs into the phone after about a week or so of use.  It was very disappointing.  I threw it away.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I liked it, the story of the animosity between the avengers could have been developed more, I think they became a team too quick.
0802473156|5.0|I read this book during my engagement and finished it before my wedding; it offers a great deal of smart and logical advice and insight relating to how to keep love strong and what factors are most important to yourself and then gives you the ability to discuss and learn more about your significant other that you may have not fully understood before.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works seamlessly with my Kindle. It's very handy to have while I am shopping at the mall.  Thanks Developers!
140006922X|3.0|presented a few new perpectives on the life and purpose of Jesus but after a while i felt like i was reading the same page twice.the ending was abrupt as if the author had finally made his quota of words and could go put his feet up
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very well made. Very creative, addictive, fun, and it makes me feel smart! It's not super hard, so there's no raging. There's  a lot of memory kind of work around too.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I wish the credits would last longer, but I understand. It seems to go so fast.<br />Because it is so fun, I am always disappointed when I have run out of credits to<br />buy cards.
B00BKTFABE|1.0|Every time I try to do a video it says the camera has stop working but I still could take pics but before that when I took a video it would fad out do not recommend
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I am a Baldacci fan and this is an excellent read.  Good plot, great characters, well-written.  All in all, another Baldacci hit.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Heard mixed reviews about this installation and was a little weary about continuing the series. some saying it's too slow.but I couldn't put it down.and the ending is amazing!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|There's a large variety of shapes to choose from, a lot of larger size puzzles. This is one I enjoy playing to make time pass.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it, a few books I will surely read again and again!!!! Anymore books that follow this trilogy? I would love to continue reading.....:0)
B007AL48UK|3.0|some of the useable tiles are hidden and I don't see the point of that. Otherwise it seems to be okay so far.
0385523394|5.0|What a poignant story.  Having been in jail personally, and knowing others in similar circumstances, this book touches the heart.  Kerman's candor is unmatched.
B0063M22QO|3.0|the few puzzles I've tried were actually very easy and didn't give much of a challenge. That'll come in handy when I want to play Mahjong but don't want to have to think about what I am doing.
B006HAPY26|5.0|This is great book but the first one was easily better but I still recommend it to any one 11 and up
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would recommend this product for those who enjoy period or era dramas. I do and I loved living this &#34;high life&#34; vicariously through this family. It takes me away to a gentler time, where people had manners...ah I miss those times.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|Wow! This album is amazing from beginning to end. My mind was set that The Crane Wife was their masterpiece, this album is making me  reconsider my stance. Buy it, enjoy it, support the artist.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I was looking for a challenge and I got it with this game and I would like to see more of them on Amazon (for free of course).
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|At the end of each episode, I can't wait wait to watch the next one! Very thoughtfully and smartly written.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|got a little boring.  You had to read the story and then find the objects which weren't difficult to fine.  MA 2 is much better.  The puzzles are more complicated and challenging to solve.
B00821PCJS|5.0|They say that all alien-terran contact films based on earth are either ET or &#34;War of the Worlds.&#34;  This clearly falls into the War of the Worlds genre, but what it brings anew to the genre is not just the conflict between terrans and aliens, but the characterization of an occupied population of terrans trying to fight back.  It's not an entirely new vision, but it is more refreshing than recent alien invasion films or series and much more fun to watch.  Acting is not always great, but serviceable.  Noah Wylie and Will Patton (whom I always like) make things work wonderfully.
0486295559|5.0|Jane Austin has written in such a way that we can see the sensitivities of womanhood and the drama involved in knowing those around us. Persuasion gives an artistic insight into the complexities of relationships and the integrity of them.
0670026638|5.0|What I liked most was Nao's sense of humor, Jiko's influence and wisdom, and Nakuri #1, the uncle who was forced to become a pilot in WWII - for he endured all kinds of bullying in the name of nationalism and war but didn't let it change him - he remained a pacifist at heart till the end.
B005HE5J7I|5.0|Fabulous historical fiction, I have read it several times. I Enjoy his descriptions and story lines.  I want to read his other books.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This film is clearly family oriented and provides a glimpse into the life and times of two villages in Victorian England. It is beautifully filmed with a focus on the lovely English countryside, attractive characters, and the ordinary problems faced by the people of the times.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I got this for a 3 year old, but I cant stop playing it! it 's beyond a three year Oldsmobile capacity anyway :) it takes awhile if you don't want to buy upgrades, but still really fun
B004EPYZXU|2.0|Even though I knew the Blair Witch Project was a fake before I started watching it, it was still very intense because it COULD have been real. Apollo 18 is so ridiculous I couldn't even pretend it was real if I tried. I won't give it away by saying why exactly but the \\"aliens\\" were so cliche, and their connection with the rest of the \\"disasters\\" really made little sense. This movie was hardly \\"horror\\" since I can't stand real horror movies at all. This was more like a spoof of a horror flick. I've experienced more \\"suspension of disbelieve\\" watching a Pixar movie. It only got 2 stars instead of 1 star because it wasn't SO boring I actually shut it off. I save 1 star ratings for movies so bad I couldn't finish to save my life.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I used to spend hours reading comic books and dreaming of being a superhero.  All together what a movie. Highly recommended action film with never a dull moment.
B009NY43NY|1.0|So disappointed in how it ended. It felt rushed and phoned in. It's too bad Ms. Harris didn't give the end of her series the same time and consideration as the rest of the Sookie books. Oh well...I'm sure if HBO made me loads of money I might give up too.
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|The album starts off great  and leaves you wanted more, love the band! Have all of the band CD and their individuals cds. Could listen to them all day.....great stuff
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|If you like an great si-fi action picture, this is it.  It's Trek enough for the fans, and engaging enough for those who just love a great movie.  See it.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|One can guess almost everything before a scene happens. I can see now why Bruce Willis wanted out of the third instalment.
B005R32L66|1.0|This app would be good if yoi would fix the bugs. Aggravating  when both people  cant hear each other and whrn poor video quality occurs.
0553296981|5.0|I bought this for my 8 year old and he already is excited to read it.  Fast shipment, book as described, not a single complaint!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, fun, and great way to spend time!!!!  Can't wait for more the second chapter.  Would like to see more games like this!!!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Abrams done it again with the 2nd in this series.  Awsome from the start wih plenty of action!  See It!
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is the kind of book that stays with you long after you've finished it .  It does go back and forth from war time to present day but I had no problem following it as I read in other reviews. I couldn't put  it down .<br />The characters were well developed and the plot was known by the end of the first chapter . From then on it kept me guessing at every turn.<br />I enjoyed learning about certain psychological problems and how they may impact a family .<br />Enjoy !
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Very entertaining and loved all the musical numbers!! These kids have some amazing voices.<br />Well worth the rent or buy!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game, though it does get frustrating when you don't get any shadow cards!! It does need some improvement for those of us who don't want to spend money becoming an elite player.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|loved it so funny and entertaining just what I needed.Such a pick me up Cameron Diaz was so funny  I would watch it again
0375842209|5.0|i did not find this an easy read ............ Death as the teller of the story was a difficult concept.<br />the writing is beautiful,<br />the movie is out In November and will be interesting to compare Book? Film?<br />cannot wait
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|One of the best soundtracks of the past few years.  It's also super great when you need to hear something motivational.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so fun I play it all the time and the horses are so cute and awesome so you guys should get it.<br /><br />.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app is accurate to an amazing degree. Easy to add multiple cities and I really enjoy the hour to hour breakdown.  Invaluable for vacation planning- knowing what clothes to pack! Thanks for an awesome free app!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Tom Cruise is more compelling in this movie than he was in his latest &#34;Oblivion.&#34;  Good action and a plausible story that doesn't stretch the imagination too much.
B006DGOV9Q|1.0|I bought these hoping that they would work for my galaxy s2 Sgh-i777 phone. They worked fine the first time I plugged it into my phone. But once I'd used up all the battery once, it died on me. It wouldn't let me charge my phone! Waste of money!
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Most action thrillers require a viewer to try and keep track of how many people have been maimed and/or killed in a movie...while there is a considerable amount of human mayhem it can't hold a candle to the number of vehicles...of all types that get destroyed in this movie. The metal mayhem is a junkyard operator's dream.
B00BFV1K0M|5.0|as good as the first .Kat is stuck as the reluctant hero but as always she wins out.but Wil she be happy.
B006BQNJR8|3.0|It's hard to replace the original even if the original wasn't all that good either.  If you have nothing else to do then this version of Conan The Barbarian is okay.
B00AEFYQE2|2.0|that is the good part of the move, the rest of the movie.....plot...<br />sorry, did not empress me...cannot write any more, except....would not enjoy seeing again....<br />thank you for all the rest ..
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Got rid of it did not like playing against people and had to wait until there were other people online :)
B00005KAQP|5.0|Also seen this movie long ago...Wanted the DVD, thank you for sending.<br />the Movie very action , fun, an spiritual.. like the movie alot..a<br />Again thank you
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I just we did not have to pay for what ever you pay to play but it's a great game I could play for hours
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|This app is ok but all you do Is the same things and opponents get harder kinda. And I passed all 50 levels. So this game just goes on forever.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Not a big gamer-but this one has me hooked! Great graphics,<br />cool tableau and  lots of hooks into the movies (which are<br />not just for kids) And free!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Flynn can really write, which is the saddest thing about this book. As much criticism as the ending has received, it really starts falling apart midway. I don't recommend it.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|A lot of fantasy in this picture but it still a great movie to watch with your family at home.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Am enjoying playing this game. I use games for relaxation so if they are too intense I don't relax, but too relaxed of a game and it is no fun. Secret Society is a great balance. Have not spent any money -the real kind and don't expect to. Great use of the HD screen on Kindle much is searching for hidden objects.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I downloaded this game on the Kindle HD and it has been one of my best purchases. You drive up and down hills collecting coins which can be used to upgrade your car. Have had lots of fun and can't seem to put it down, lol. Highly recommended.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is the first book or rather 3 books I have read on my Kindle. It was a very good read.<br /><br />After I read the first of the three books, I watched the movie, which was rather disappointing. The book is much better!<br />I just kept on reading until I was finished. Great build-up, very exciting story.<br /><br />The second book was also read in a bink of an eye. The build-up is kind of the same. You feel very familiar with the whole concept and the characters.<br />Book three was a bit of a strugle to me. Not because it isn't a good one, but I didn't have the time to put my mind on it. So I laid it aside for about a year. When I started reading again, in a few hours I was finished.<br /><br />These books are on my list to reread them in a few years ... Maybe even read the second one again before I see the movie...
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I love this movie -- fun to watch for both kids and parents. Would highly recommend!  Good animation and storyline.
B0074V3712|5.0|Edward O. Wilson has given us a concise yet amazingly comprehensive description of evolution and humanity's unique destiny.  I am grateful to have found this wonderful book.
1616550414|5.0|Amazing book! When I saw this I knew I had to have it! I seriously recommend this to any Zelda fan!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Not a wasted scene...well developed characters, very compelling story...some very dramatic scenes...a few twists and turns.<br /><br />One of those movies that stays with you.
B0085A9HU6|5.0|Excellent and Classic movie that can only come from a Legendary Parent as well as icon Bruce Lee who was in a category unmatched except by his ManChild!
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|I love it.  Went to the concert at DTE and had a great time.  Anything BTR records is great! Thanks!
B00181JGI2|5.0|This Cohen Brothers epic is hands down the greatest movie of all-time.  The depth of plot, the characters, and the memorable lines.  It will be remembered as the Cohen Brothers' Opus and the greatest Cult B-Movie.  The Dude continues to this day to take it easy for us sinners on dvd and on downloadable instant video.  Have a Caucasian with Jackie Treehorn or simply smoke a J with the Urban Achievers, as you follow the exploits of The Dude, Walter and Donny on an escapade of nihilism, degradation and out right laziness.  This move is pretty much what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps... or more pointedly, you @$%& one in the .....
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is written in simple first person, but the characters are complex and interesting. It was a short read but made a big impact in a few pages. It was elegant and concise. I read it quickly but thought about it for a long time afterward. I can't wait to see the movie!
0788859544|5.0|Love it. It keeps my three year old intertwined.she can watch it over and over.  Can't wait for the newedition
0307352153|5.0|This is an enjoyable and enlightening read. Well referenced and written. I find much to contemplate after finishing the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|my little girl will be on it for days trying to get past it but she loves it. it is the best game ever
0525425772|4.0|I buy these books for my grandson who is 12 years old. He likes them and I read them before I give them to him. They are entertaining. I buy all of John Grisham's books. He is one of my favorite authors.
B00EFNXPFK|4.0|JM again makes an album that seems to speak to everyone. Great music. Absolutely love it. Each album builds off the other and cant be mistaken for one of the others. Who you love and badge and gun have to be my favorite 2 songs on the album. Was very surprised Katy Perry could sing so well.
B001XUPD94|5.0|These guys rock..I'm always entertained watching their show and I always come away with new info on some deranged subject...great entertainment...
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|A very surprisingly awesome movie. Tense, and real life. It was horrifying how everyone and everything got swept away, but it was very believable and wonderful to see their point of view.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|This is a gentle, leisure stroll through England and British life at an earlier time. I don't think everyone would feel it. Has universal appeal but I am really enjoying the visit.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|This movie was smart and entertaining, but I found it a little long. I think they could have shortened it and still gotten all the points across. It's surprising, and the actors are all fantastic.
B0096HK4WW|1.0|horrible movie! I think the high ratings were solely due to nude scene  Acting was bad, very disappointed in that I rarely take time to watch a movie
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book.  A bit complicated in terms of the names of the characters.  This is worth reading.  Enjoy.
B0063M22QO|4.0|keeps me entertained while I have down time at work. recommended for puzzle lover's everywhere! wish the game had an achievement incentive though
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are awesome!  Love listening to their music.  I also appreciate the speediness of the transaction.  I was totally satisfied with the experience.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|My grandson, age 9, and I both read this.  It was fun.  Love the chapter titles.  My grandson has gone on to read the other 2 books in this trilogy.  It has been very motivating for him.  Lots of 4th graders at the school I volunteered at last year read it and liked it.  Good book to discuss point of view since the 2 siblings write their own chapters.
B002361MLA|5.0|If you buy the cd expect to hear a very monotone voice.  I believe the tone is intentional to relay the his point but may be difficult for most to listen to for an extended period of time.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|... the way North Dallas Forty does football. I'm neither a sports fan nor a lawyer, but loved this so much I tore through it in two sittings AND my husband, a legal-thriller fan, felt the same way. Among the top 5 of the past year for both of us.
B005544TRQ|4.0|A little....a lot...unbelievable but still very entertaining. Give it a couple episodes and then it takes off and you will be hooked.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I read it too recently to have mostly forgotten it already, but it was good enough to keep me reading to the end.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This app brought my Kindle Fire HD sound to life,I use it when attached to external speaker and it add more depth to the sound and when I plug it into my home stereo it sounds so much better.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Deserves all the buzz it has gotten, a mesmerizing book in beautifully fashioned writing and a surefooted, unpredictable plot. Might be the best book I've read in a yesr, and I read voraciously, about 3 books a week.
B00E193TM2|5.0|This album is so freakishly good that it is almost incomprehensible that people having listened to it aren't in a coma brought on by happiness overload. Each and every time I slip on the headphones and crank this CD up to volume 11 it makes me want to shave with a rusty cheese grater and steal my neighbors van so I can customize it with shag carpeting and big gnarly skulls everywhere but I can't afford the court fees for Grand theft auto charges or the medical bills to correct my cheese grater scars so I make due with just banging my head repeatedly. These guys are true Metal Gods and should be worshiped as such so get down on your knees and thank them everyday for giving you the will to carry on as I do at least a dozen times a day. I feel somebody should create a new religion built around worshiping FFDP and it should be called Knucklhedianity!!! If you happen to listen to this album and find it anything less than the greatest music ever made then you are obviously some kind of socially deformed Beiber fan that needs a good but-kicking. We should start a petition to rename the nations capitol to Five-Finger-Death-Punchvilleburgopolistania and change the stars on the flag to brass knuckles, we can change the national bird to a giant skull with feathers glued to it and call it a Knuckle-headed death vulture. We can have the national anthem changed to every FFDP song in row one after the other. We should change the national past time to FFDP moshing and turn it into a sport with teams and a Superbowl and everything.... that would be awesome!!! Well that's my review now I'm off to write my congressman and get the ball rolling on this Nations Capitol re-naming thing, Go ahead and buy the album and then make your friends, coworkers, family, priest, dentist, auto mechanic, babysitter, maid, the guy across the street that still dresses like it's the 70's, the mailman, and your dog listen to it EVERY single day!!!!!<br /><br />Peace out!!!!!<br />The dude on too much coffee and not nearly enough sleep!!!e and not nearly enough sleep!!!
B000SEI618|2.0|Though banville is a highly respected writer and The Ses won high accolades and prestigious prizes, I just couldn't get through it. i gave it a 75-page try but it simply didn't grab me. Life is too short ...
B000YMFCS4|5.0|I decided to watch The Notebook after not having seen it in about five years. I'm so glad I watched it! Awesome movie!

0064471837|5.0|There are tons of fantasy novels out there in the wild, but none quite so entertaining, intriguing, and stimulating as Sabriel and its 2 sister books, Lirael and Abhorsen.<br /><br />It has magic, swords, and even necromancers!<br /><br />Sabriel is a girl who has been raised for the most part in a country known as Ancelstierre, where magic doesn't work unless the wind is blowing in the right direction. That direction is across a giant wall to the south, that borders what is known as the Old Kingdom. Its a place where few dare to set foot, and even fewer are allowed to cross without special documentation.<br /><br />The Old Kingdom has long been plagued by wicked folk known as necromancers; people who raise the dead to do their bidding. The only one standing in their way is the Abhorsen, Sabriel's father. But when Sabriel gets a rather frightening message from her father, she reluctantly sets off to his rescue.<br /><br />Along the way she'll come across many strange and dangerous creatures, and you'll be holding your breath every step of the way, whether you're reading it for the very first time, or the 50th, this book never grows old. I'm a fan of fantasy books, but I have never reread a single one before Sabriel came along. I hope the same is true for you!
B0044C6V0S|5.0|It was entertaining and I thoroughly enjoyed the interaction between the Finder crew and the Bones group of scientists. The status tussle between Walter and Seely was so apropos.  GREAT MIX!
B00C7D3TRO|4.0|FOB managed to maintain their upbeat catchy sound while keeping it new. I appreciate the variety on this album, even though I can't say every song is my favorite (like I could on older albums).
B009FZFONO|5.0|I would recommend this series to everyone!  At first when my husband came to me and said that he wanted to start watching this show so he was caught up for season Four I thought...Really zombies, no thank you!  It's so much more than that!  You really feel for the characters and your favorite changes with each season!  I am now addicted to this show and can not wait until October for season four!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it! Just enough intrigue to keep you guessing and coming back, plus a great look back at how things were in that era between World Wars.
B001BANK32|5.0|I just loved this book....much much better than the movie..the ending surprised the hell out of me....nothing like the movies ending....cannot wait for part two.... I have already pre-ordered it...just have to wait until it downloads to my kindle...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so much fun. I can hardly put it down.  I love being able to play the slots and then go back to bingo.  I would highly recommend it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I am loving playing Mahjong.  This is A NEW game, a FUN GAME. A game that makes me think. I recommend this version to beginners.
193700788X|1.0|DEA is a horrible book.  Even after reading it 3 times, I think it's the worst ending for any series I've ever read. The villains in the story were just horrible. How could Niall not think that Claude would go after Sookie? I don't see the contract helping Sookie out either. She was at the Summit and played a huge role there. Once other Kings, Queens or even Sheriffs find out that she doesn't belong to anyone, I'm sure they'll be knocking on her door and threatening to hurt someone she loves just to get her. She was way out of character in this book as well. She complains so much about her telepathy yet she doesn't realize that it has saved her life so much in the past. I've already thought of an alternate conclusion of my mine and Im quite satisfied enough to never read this book again.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a fun game and my kids love it as much as I do. I just wish there wasn't so many things you have to spend money on.
B005K17RU0|5.0|App to have when you're in college. Let's me check out the weather for the day, week and more for my walks from class to class.
B004M5BZS0|5.0|Yeah, 40 years ago I had two of these on vinyl. I don't know why I never bought the Volunteers album, but had several songs from it on The Worst of Jefferson Airplane album. Had some of their other albums as well. If you're look'n for that 60's San Francisco rock, here it is! To find these discs in a box set at such a reasonable price is the bomb man! And there's more box sets of this band and others. As Grace Slick always said &#34;Feed your head&#34;. I don't know when but I do know I'll be back for more of these steal deals. Thanks Amazon!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Wonderful program, cannot wait to see all them. I never got to see the first season, so I am finding out what happened before I saw season 3
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is wonderful. It has an inspiring and unbelievable message. There are some graphic scenes described but there is not to many. I enjoyed the book and highly recommend it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a wonderful book.  Incredible display of feelings that effect every marriage, love for our children and the joy and despair of love and loss.  Liane Moriarty gives us all the what ifs and reality of life as middle aged adults.  Love this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really fun and easy to be addicted to it.<br />Only been playing for a few minutes and I am already addicted
1439102732|5.0|Jodi Picoult, in her usual way -- with humor and a light touch -- leads her readers on a thought-provoking journey; a journey designed to question social justice and to whom these civil rights belong. Does one individual or group deserve more civil liberties than another . . . or not? This is precisely what her book, Sing You Home, touches upon.<br /><br />The question of social justice -- and to whom it belongs -- is presented through the complicated interwoven relationship of the main character, Zoe, her ex-husband, Max, and her lover, Vanessa as they travel on the grandest road-trip of all: Life and the pursuit of marriage and starting a family. So that the reader fully understands these characters -- including every thought and emotion -- Jodi Picoult writes each of them from a first-person perspective. You are thrust into each of these characters in order to experience their lives first-hand. You truly feel the joy, and later the heart-wrenching despair at the loss of an unborn child; the utter helpless desperation, hurt, anger, and confusion associated with divorce; the euphoria, pleasure, and wonder of new love -- once realized; and feeling betrayed by someone you thought you knew. All the while you are brought to two realizations: first, whether one is gay or straight, the pursuit of happiness, love, and family is the same; only the gender of one's partner is different; and, second, the legal ramifications of allowing or denying marriage is profound; where one group doesn't need to think about their rights as they expect them, while the other group must file reams of legal papers covering everything from living wills to adoption papers in order to protect their families.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I think this app is the best ever. Because I Just had a liver and kidney transplant this is almost as good as going to bingo. I can't go for awhile so this is just fine. Thank You for giving me a chance to still play. Except I don't win real money but that's ok.  :.) It's great!
B005S9EJ46|5.0|This movie makes you realize how one must live life to the fullest.  The regrets one might live with are a waste and relationships blossom at any age.  Loved it!
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|It is a great deal of fun. I spent days at home with a brief illness and never got bored or tired playing this game.
B0008ENICU|5.0|1939 - Black&White.<br />If you're into old movies, this one is a must have for your collection.<br />I loved \\"The Women\\".  It has an aray of stars including Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, and Rosalind Russell just to name a few.  Gossip, back stabbing, snitching, and just plain bitchiness are a few of the things that make this movie a hit.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I thought it was going to be like all the rest of the games but its basically a speedracer ripoff.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these to replace a broken pair of v55's and im not disappointed in the least.<br /><br />The build quality is pretty good, and the sound quality is of course great. Very balanced sound, and very comfortable too. My only knock is the cord isn't removable, so if I ever damage it, I may have to just buy a new pair all together.<br /><br />Build quality 9/10<br />Sound quality 10/10<br />Comfortable 10/10
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Victoria, the main protagonist, has just the right combination of anger and resentment, but is saved by flowers thanks to a woman who intended to adopt her but couldn't quite take the final step.  Except, here, in contrast to what would happen in the real world, it wasn't the end of the road for Victoria.  Grant, her boyfriend, is someone out of a romance novel, or what I imagine a character in a romance novel would be like (even the name &#34;Grant&#34; sounds romance-novel to me).  I never would have picked this book but for my book group for which it was the choice.  If you want to scratch the surface of foster childhood, but go no deeper, this is a good read.  Or, if you want to know how the Victorians used flowers to communicate (or not), this could be a good read.  Or, if you like romance novels.  Otherwise, not so good.
B005MMYPIE|5.0|I actually bought this album after The Nexus, which is one of the best power-rock albums I've ever heard. The band's debut album didn't disappoint, either. If you like fast-paced pop metal with fantastic hooks and three great vocalists with different styles rotating vocals throughout the songs, this band will hit your musical sweet spot, as it did mine. Loved seeing them live when the came to the States (Salt Lake City), and hope they record at least another 10 albums just like their first two.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Great stories.  Great casting.  Intelligent dialogue.  For some reason I enjoyed this far more on my iPad than the giant flat screen and my theory is that the characters and storyline drawn you in in such a way as create the feeling of community with the viewer.  Could be, as community is one of the reoccurring themes.  Watching this is time well spent.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Like this series for the look at the time period and I don't mind drama, but in a &#34;Masterpiece Classic&#34; I want only realistic drama- the break down of social classes (Sybil marrying Tom, Rose out clubbing), WWI, the Titanic, the influenza pandemic, etc. I'm sick of the additional scheming by Thomas and O'Brien and how many soap opera scenes their schemes add because once one person finds out, you have to watch that person tell everyone else about it a few people at a time. Or worse, you have to watch them act awkward as they try to hide it.<br /><br />Even assuming real people could get away with as much as Thomas and O'Brien do, there are enough REAL drama plots in this show without creating a duo of heinous characters. I can't watch one show without feeling annoyed by petty soap opera drama. I gave up on Glee after the 3rd or 4th season because the great singing and dancing can be watched on You Tube while avoiding the stupid teenie bopper drama and the unrealistic Sue Sylvester character. Thomas and O'Brien are almost as unbelievable as her. Writers for these shows seem to think you can create interesting villains by making them soap-opera-evil and then tempering them over time to seem more human. If you're going to try for that kind of realism, you need to BEGIN with a character that is believable. Enough of the soap opera already.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|Extremely well made movie with highly intelligent conversations! The story pace is excellent and on par with some of the most famous action movies except that the characters are in Lego blocks. It is worth every penny.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Great app works well with tablet. This is one of the best electronics I have used yet.<br />Was looking for a tablet that would work for me during class.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|I've never been shy of \\"kids\\" movies, especially, if they're good.  My friend told me how funny it was, and I was in. I'm glad I rented it.  Good fun, especially after a long work week!  Now I've got to see the new one. :)
B009AJDDQU|3.0|This movie tried to hard to be a good prequel, and not hard enough to be a good movie in it's own right.
030771652X|4.0|Our Islands book club, made up of eleven women, selected this book without knowing anything about it. We had probably the mostly meaningful discussion of the year about women with and without sisters. We discussed how having sisters has impacted our lives. Also we discovered those of us without sisters spend our lives looking for someone to play that role. We liked the journalling  device used to tell the story as it was very effective. This is definitely a winner but only for the female persuasion.
B00DUYUFZS|4.0|I do believe there are silver linings in life and this book made me reflect on life as I read it. I wasn't a fan of the football as much, and I don't think he should be so incapacitated by his mental illness, as I know what it is to have one. One thing the author did do was capture hope at it's finest. I read it in two days. I just finished it, and I really did like it, just not the sports so much. This book could really appeal to men as well as the ladies. I'm not stereotyping, I just want to say it has something to offer for more than one reader base. I can see that some women might get tired of the sports, but it is still a great book if you are okay with it. I would recommend it either way.
B0011WL8MK|5.0|This film came highly recommended to me by a gentleman with whom I struck up a conversation while waiting for a MetroBus in Washington, D.C.  I am a fan of Robert Stack.  I have read his autobiography.  He mentions the film, particularly his nervousness at playing opposite Carole Lombard.  Robert Stack was 23 or so when he made this movie.  Ten years before, at the age of 13, he had a towering crush on Carole Lombard, who was a family friend and visited the Stack home.  In his autobiography, he has several photographs taken of him and Carole Lombard clowning around on the set of this film -- her way of loosening him up and getting him over his nervousness.<br /><br />The plot involves a theatre group in Warsaw in 1939.  The Germans have just marched in, and there is a resistance movement.  Jack Benny, of all people, plays the star of the theater group.  He has an actor's ego, but not much talent -- until he must impersonate a university professor who is a spy for the Germans, and a German High Command officer, in order to prevent disaster for Polish citizens.  Carole Lombard plays Benny's wife, in an unlikely pairing that actually works.  Stack is a Polish air forces lieutenant who, upon the German invasion, flees with other Polish pilots to England, there to carry on the fight for their homeland as adjuncts to the Royal Air Force.  He also is infatuated with Carole Lombard (art imitating life?), professing his love for her behind her husband's back.<br /><br />When the Polish airmen discover that the professor, ostensibly supporting them, is in reality a Nazi spy, Stack must parachute into Poland to carry the news and attempt to contact the underground resistance movement, so they can stop the professor from carrying damaging information to the Gestapo.<br /><br />The story goes from humor to stark drama in short and startling order -- but it works.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I knew I had to see this movie after I read the book. After only a couple sittings to read the book, I was watching the movie. It was put together wonderfully. It is very different from the book, but in some ways they kept important details intact. It wasn't at all what I pictured in the book if I compared it, but it never is. For what they were able to fit in two and a half hours, I still hung onto every visual detail, and every single word. I am never so hyper focused on movies, so that goes to show how well they did. Whether you read the book or not, I would definitely recommend this. It stays true to the heart of the story, and keeps the meaning of it intact.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Holy crap!  I never thought I'd be interested in a remake of the Evil Dead.  The first one was just too perfect!  But here I am absolutely effing speechless after watching Jane Levy pull off the new feminist version of Ashley!  This remake was so intense!  I have not been scared, affected and just screaming at the TV like this in years!  AWESOME HORROR MOVIE!!!! I WANT ALL THE OTHER CHAPTERS TO THE EVIL DEAD REMADE!!!!!  Jane Levy I bow to you! :)
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Great game. Some glitches on upgrades but very good support. Does not require online friends or cash output you can do both for an enhanced gaming experience. Great for all ages.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I loved this book especially for the reversal aspect!  It was fun to see Mickey in an opposite position AND teamed with someone he hasn't worked with in this capacity before.  I was kept in suspense until the end, where once again, things end differently than I suspected.  Excellent writing!

B001DUKHXQ|5.0|There's nothing I can say that would be new about the Thriller album. But I gotta give my thumbs up for this vinyl presentation. Even when I was kid I new there was something special about color or printed vinyl albums, you know? they got you out of the monotony of the &#34;spining black circles&#34; that were the mayority of that time's LPS.<br /><br />The one I bought comes in a plactic transparent sleeve  with a insert that displays the lyrics on the album and with some pictures wich I imagined appeared on the original back in the 80's.<br /><br />The vinyl itself displays a picture of Michael in a White jacket lying down on side A and a picture of him in a red jacket with zombies behind him on side B. I really hope you enjoy it as much as I.<br /><br />Me gusta mucho esta nueva presentaci&oacute;n de Thriller y como no tengo nada que agregar a las millones de criticas positivas acerca de este &aacute;lbum les describo como es el ejemplar que compre.<br /><br />Viene en un sobre transparente de pl&aacute;stico, en vez de cart&oacute;n como generalmente sucede, y con un hoja donde aparecen las letras de las canciones y algunas fotos que supongo aparec&iacute;an tambi&eacute;n en la presentaci&oacute;n original de los a&ntilde;os ochenta.<br /><br />En el lado A aparece Michael recostado sobre su codo con una chaqueta blanca, creo que era la portada original y en el lado B aparece Michael con una chaqueta roja y un grupo de Zombies detr&aacute;s de el.<br /><br />Espero que disfruten esta edici&oacute;n de Thriller tanto como yo.

1594203334|5.0|I was having trouble finding baby-prep reading that I could get into, that wasn't 100% bias on every topic, and that my husband and I could both enjoy. This book did it all. There are tips in here I will be using and my husband and I both agree on so much of her 2-sides of the observations so it gives us options on how we want to address so many important topics like sleeping through the night, breastfeeding, or even over-parenting.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I was absolutely amazed. This cable charged my kindle fire!! Just when I thought I was going to have to throw out my kindle I discovered it could be charged with this incredibl item! Why don't They make these for other devices?! I could save a fortune every year in cell phones if they would just make something like this for them! What a world that would be!
B00CFITJKW|1.0|Not only were the graphics terrible, but the quality of the game was terrible as well.  This game does not in any way resemble a flight simulator.  It is very cheesy and unrealistic.  Anyone who likes simulators like me would not enjoy this game.  I immediately regretted paying 5 bucks for it.  I wish I could take the money back!
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|There are 3 HUGE problems with this developer and their app.<br /><br />1. Money, you can't do much in this game unless you get upgrades. The problem is upgrades are RIDICULOUSLY expensive. For example<br /><br />Unlocking a new vehicle 800 coins<br />1st upgrade 1600 coins<br />2nd upgrade 5000 coins<br />3rd upgrade 10000 coins<br />4th upgrade 20000 coins<br /><br />Here is the problem with that I loaded this freshly onto a new tablet. To get that first purchase of 800 coins took 10 games with an average gain of 73 coins per game.<br /><br />So how many times do you need to play to get the next upgrade (1600pts) well if your getting 73 coins per game that's an additional 22 times to play the game.<br /><br />What this means is that you pretty much MUST buy a coin doubler at a cost of $1.99 just to get ANYWHERE with this game.<br /><br />So what upgrades do you need?<br /><br />Lets see<br />Coin Doubler $1.99<br />2000 coins $.99<br />5000 coins $1.99<br />10000 coins $2.99<br />25000 coins $4.99<br />100K coins $9.99<br /><br />So what do you buy with that many coins?<br /><br />1. boost 5 levels starting at 200 going to 20000 coins<br />2. Shield 5 levels starting at 200 going to 20000 coins<br />3. Coin Magnet 5 levels starting at 200 going to 20000 coins<br />4. Coin Bubble 5 levels starting at 200 going to 20000 coins<br />5. Checkpoint 5 levels starting at 200 going to 20000 coins<br /><br />2. Repetitiveness. The game has 4 \\"scenes\\" The familiar beach scene, a jungle scene, a fire/ volcano one and a frozen ice land scene. You race through them trying to get to the next checkpoint. There is no pre laid out route. The scenes change in the order that they appear as you race through them but the core really never changes. So basically you are racing the same little mini scenes over and over and over they just appear in random orders.<br /><br />3. Not beatable. I'm usually a really good race game player. But I can't get past 45%. I still play it from time to time but have pretty much given up on it as the repetitiveness has worn on me.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />So my point to all this is: IF you are collecting 200-300 coins per game, This is a total JOKE when upgrades cost 10000 coins! I bought the $5 pack and a coin doubler and REFUSE to buy more. I now play the game a few times a week but its not really getting me any farther in the game.<br /><br />So its fun but don't get suckered into buying coin pack after coin packime but have pretty much given up on it as the repetitiveness has worn on me.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />So my point to all this is: IF you are collecting 200-300 coins per game, This is a total JOKE when upgrades cost 10000 coins!

B00DJYJPLO|5.0|Let's first get two things out of the way.  If you've seen BEFORE SUNRISE and/or BEFORE SUNSET and disliked them...there is no reason to give BEFORE MIDNIGHT a try.  And if you haven't seen those movies at all, I HIGHLY recommend you do prior to checking out Richard Linklater's latest near classic.<br /><br />I should also warn that even the most cursory mention of plot points in either the 2ndor the 3rdmovie can be construed as spoilers...but it's tough to talk about the 3rdfilm without giving away some surprise.  I'll balance as best I can.<br /><br />In BEFORE SUNRISE, young American Jesse (Ethan Hawke), age about 23 meets young Frenchwoman Celine (Julie Delpy), age about 23.  They are on a train bound for Vienna.  Jesse is flying back to the US from Vienna the morning after the train arrives.  Celine is on her way back to Paris after visiting family in Budapest.  They strike up a conversation and clearly hit it off right away.  Jesse asks Celine to get off the train with him and spend the night wandering Vienna before he has to leave Europe.  The movie follows their ambling through Vienna and just lets them talk.  And talk.  And talk.  And fall in love.  For the right viewer, this was a nearly magical film that beautiful captured, through long, semi-improvised takes, the joy of two people getting to know each other and come to appreciate and even love each other.  We felt like we were right there with them, and the two stars gave terrific performances.  At the end, they agree they will meet again in 6 months, and we're left to wonder what happened to them.<br /><br />BEFORE SUNSET tells us (spoilers coming up).  It's nine years later, and Jesse is in Paris speaking about his new book, which is clearly a retelling of that night in Vienna.  Celine seeks him out and we quickly discover they did NOT meet (I won't spoil why).  Jesse has just an hour before he needs to leave for the airport, and he and Celine pick up their easy conversation and share about their lives, including the regrets and unhappinesses they've had.  It's clear they are meant to be together...their affection blooms almost immediately.  New to the equation are some minor quarrels (why didn't you come?  If only you hadn't..., etc.).  But in the end, Jesse is deciding to miss his flight so he can delight in being in Celine's apartment, drinking tea, listening to her sing.  The final scene of the movie is one of heartbreaking simplicity and yet such complex emotion.<br /><br />Now, another 9 years later, the two are each around 41 years old.  SPOILERS AHEAD.  They have been together since that time in Paris.  They've had a sometimes rocky road, and this movie is more talking...this time in lovely Greece.  They have kids.  They aren't \\"new\\" to each other anymore as they were in the first 2 films.  They are now capable of getting on each other's nerves.  They haven't always just made each other happy.  And near the end of the film, they engage in what I can only describe as the most brutal husband and wife argument since George and Martha got into it in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF.  There's no violence, but it's a rough scene.  Raw and searing.  Funny.  Truthful.  Utterly gripping.<br /><br />In real life, were I to spend much time with either of these two...I think I'd seriously dislike them.  They are self-centered, pretentiously \\"artsy\\" and VERY vocal.  I don't think I'd want to sit and listen to them talk all day.  But this is a film, and Linklater and his stars (who have co-writing credit) can take us to just the right moments.  The conversations (and snatches of conversation) that tell us all we need to know about the last nine years.  It's an amazing film.  It's illuminating and full of so many truths.  They may not always be truths I can personally relate to...but they feel true and possible and real.  After the film, you talk about Jesse and Celine as though they were real people.  More than just about any other movie ever, I think.  Their dialogue isso specific and so revealing.  Yes, these folks are more articulate than any \\"real\\" people...but we don't really want to see normal, sloppy conversation.  It's enjoyable to spend some time with these folks (although, again, I wouldn't like them in \\"real life\\") because they react to each other so believably.  Their words mirror their actions and their expressions.  Delpy and Hawke (who I'm not normally a huge fan of) have chemistry that's astonishing...you really feel you're peeking in on something you aren't meant to see and hear.<br /><br />All three films include gorgeous scenery, and BEFORE MIDNIGHT is the most gorgeous of all.  The Greek countryside and seaside is lovely, and Linklater just lets his camera take it in casually.  Jesse & Celine comment on it sometimes, but mostly it just flows over us.  And the film is mostly a series of very long takes (the scene near the opening when they are driving from the airport back to the house they're staying at is at least 15 minutes long, and seen entirely through a front windshield...but it NEVER feels static).  These films are made with such deceptive simplicity.<br /><br />I acknowledge that these films could also be insufferable to watch.  My wife and I rewatched the first two just before going to this latest release, and BEFORE SUNRISE feels a smidge pretentious now. I think that has more to do with the fact that I'm also 18 years older.  I have less patience for the naivet&eacute; of \\"young love\\" than I used to.  But that also brought home to me that a perfectly legitimate reaction to these films could be boredom or loathing of the characters.  But I consider myself lucky to be swept away by all three films...and in my opinion, BEFORE MIDNIGHT is best of the bunch.  It's gorgeous to look at.  It's richer in themes and content.  It features the biggest acting challenges and the most blistering dialogue.  It's hopeful (as all the films are), but the hope is the hardest fought and hardest won here.  I highly recommend all three films for ADULT viewers...not just because they contain some profane language, but because I can't imagine a child or teen really understanding what these two are blathering on about (or caring).  But if you're adult and you've been in love (or are in love) and have any inkling of the complications of being an adult in our world...this film should resonate resoundingly.so specific and so revealing.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|A good story for everyone, but especially for women and girls.  Shows the importance of supporting family members in order for them to fulfill their dreams.
B00A285OOW|1.0|Very boring and shallow rendition. Not historically accurate at all. Gregory has done much better with the other books in the Cousins' War series.
B00640UICA|5.0|Kids will definitely like the cuteness of the game which is honestly what almost stopped me from getting the game. After seeing the video and reading a review or or two I decided to get it and give it a try.<br /><br />Worth the regular price for it as far as I can tell at the moment. The object of the game is to get all the creatures to hold hands which is more difficult than what it sounds.<br /><br />Creatures have one, two or six arms to have to join meaning they need to touching said number of creatures. One in specific can be rotated by tapping and they all can be moved. You can even switch their spots by simply moving the piece to where another is placed thus replacing it. Different type of creatures have different abilities. Some cannot be moved, one rotates, others can only be attached to others with tentacles. others, have to remain alone.<br /><br />There are plenty of levels to complete and aim to collect the stars. Not exactly sure what that does at the moment but it does track that as well. The collecting of the stars seems to be the equivalent of the three star on the other games.<br /><br />Another great feature is the ability to create profiles through the extras feature allowing multiple people to play on the same device without disrupting one another. A huge plus for those who share devices.<br /><br />Overall is a cute game kids will enjoy and at the same time challenging enough for adults as well. Will easily recommend it to others.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I'm American so perhaps I just don't \\"get it\\" but to me both modern versions of Persuasion have lead actresses that are not attractive in any way.I understand that the \\"bloom of youth is supposed to have waned a bit, but Amanda Root is Very drab here,looking to be in her late 30's not her late 20's. They do glam her up a bit 3/4 the way through the movie but her bland visage detracts from the bulk of the movie. Also,I would have had the part of Captain Bennick played by a less doughy,lumpy faced actor. It's not like his character is witty & charming, so you'd have to completely suspend belief to think that a young teenage girl would fall for him so quickly.<br />  The other actors fit into their characters well.<br /> The production, sound and dialogue are all first rate.... So much so that by the time you've gotten to the end of the movie, you're left with the pleasant happy \\"buzz\\",&lt;which was the reason you chose a Jane Austen movie in the first place !>
B008JFUR10|5.0|If you went to see transformers 1, 2 or 3 and felt like you didint get enough action and wanted more, this is the movie for you.  THIS IS WHAT TRANSFORMERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN!  From start to finish the movie is full-throttle action and barely lets up to give you a story(WHICH IS STILL BETTER THAN TRANSFORMERS)!<br /><br />So if you dont like seeing Shia Labouf life story movies where Transformers happen at the last 30 minutes and just wish it was endless robot fighting for nearly 2 hours than this is your dream movie.  the story is sufficient, just dont go in expecting the Dark Knight and you will have a hell of a time.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I ordered a Chromecast 2.5 weeks back and it arrived 2 days early! I was so excited and ripped it out of the box to find the USB or AC adapter required for power. I thought to myself what the heck is the point of having a device that plugs directly into HDMI if I also have to have either 1) USB or 2) AC to power the dang thing. Why not just make a puck like the Roku or even the Apple TV??<br /><br />Meh.. I looked past that and plugged it into my new Sharp 39\\" LED TV. All I have to say is once I got it hooked up I was dissapointed. Once again another Google beta project. Sure it has potential. But right now my SMART TV + DirecTV does everything the Chromecast does better. e.g Netflix and Youtube.<br /><br />The Chrome browser integration and streaming is buggy as well. My Wifi network at home is very fast and when streaming from Chrome on my Alienware PC (Wifi Router and TV are upstairs 1 room apart) the video was laggy and quality was bad.<br /><br />Only reason I don't return the Chromecast is because it was only $35.00. So I will hold on to it and see what happens. It's ok though, I forgive Google. I still really love my new 2nd Gen Nexus 7\\" tablet.. so wish I could stream the NFL pre-season APP or mirror my Nexus screen with my TV though. May be next year when they release a new version. For now it's a great way to stream Netflix and Youtube if you don't have a SMART Tv or Roku.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This is a  good app that is easy to use.<br /><br />Too bad the Kindle Fire  HD does not have a forward facing lens.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I love having a calendar that is so convenient and easy to program...I am not a major socialite, but love to be able to mark my important dates...thank you for making it easy for an older, seasoned person.
B001B1R1EU|5.0|This trumpet player is a true artist.  I enjoyed every second of the CD.  She is a really gifted artist.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|watching animals get abused, funny monkey sounds, and the ability to customize your monkey.  can't ask for more.  buy it if you have the spare cash
B008ROH07W|5.0|Another great CD by a truly gifted artist.  She is not only brilliant with that long trumpet but she carries herself with great dignity.  I am truly blessed to have heard this woman love the notes out of this instrument.  Stupendous.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a very good series that not only has good characters but multiple story lines that span more then one episode.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It works pretty well for a quick sharpen but i still like the stone or eve a auto diamond sharpener.
B005723JSQ|4.0|This was a typical chick lit book, light and entertaining. It moves fast and was enjoyable to read while on vacation.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Like most games of this genre, if you just put some thought and reasoning into it you can figure out the solutions.  However, also like most games of the genre, once you get to a certain point the solutions make absolutely NO sense.  There is no logical thought process that can get you through some of these, and you have to end up &#34;cheating&#34; and looking up the solution.  Very entertaining to that point, though, and makes you use your brain.
0545265355|5.0|I read these books in one week.  easy to read and read quickly.  good dystopian story line with a strong female lead.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I downloaded this so I could &#34;side load&#34; the Dolphin browser.  I was following instructions from the web on how to do this, and it all working perfectly.  I would like to &#34;side load&#34; more apps, but so far haven't been able to follow other instructions.  But when I do find some, I have no doubt ES File Explorer will run them perfectly.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I could not put my kindle down. Can not wait for the next book to come out ,I can't wait to see where the next book goes
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I actually LOVE this game, I'm addicted to it.  However, it doesn't work worth a hoot on a Kindle.  Kindle just isn't responsive enough to keep the game going.  I went back to playing it on my phone.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I have liked this movie from the first time that I saw it not too long after it came out of theaters.  Good clean movie that entertains and enthralls.  Wish the online version had the deleted scenes!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I love it!! His lyrics and flow are as fresh as ever...I'm really enjoying the production as well as the artists that have joined him on the album!!
0545265355|5.0|I haven't loved a book series this much in a very long time!  I couldn't put them down.  Highly recommended for everyone!
B000S88JTS|4.0|Bought this as a gift for a deplyed service member.  These are his thoughts:<br /><br />A semi-documentary of how bike racing used to be.<br />It follows big-time names like Steve McQueen.<br />It covers Moto to Trials to Ice racing and everything in-between.<br />Recommend for the old-time rider or someone who can remember the big names of history of bike racing.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great writing, engaging characters.  We watch an episode each evening (that's about all the tv we watch daily).  Look forward to it!
B00DW39B2K|5.0|Very well-written movie! Outstanding performances by both Robert DeNiro & John Travolta, beautiful scenery & superb storyline!<br />Highly recommend with 5 well-deserved stars!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app i play it 247 the updates keep coming next year it will be as good as x box
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Very well done and jnfoatibe while being super entertaining. Hats off to Fabe Grohl as he shows another side of his creativity
B0040I09RM|5.0|Awesome show. I'm so addicted now. I can't stop watching. I'm watching 3-4 episodes a night now. Trying to catch up to the new season
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Thought the movie was okay. Tom Curise has always done good in action movies. This isn't a Mission Impossible but does have a good bit of action. Would have liked to have seen a lot more of Morgan Freeman here.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|this stylus makes using the kindle fire easy and much better than using your finger, easy and affordable, worth the money for sure
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I love TOMS! These shoes are too cute, and for those wondering, they are real TOMS. This was my first time purchasing TOMS, so I took a chance on the sizing, I usually wear a 9.5-10 in womens shoes, I'd go with a 9 next time. The 9.5 I purchased fit fine with socks, but without, I'm asking to be swimming in them! Very cute! I wish I had a pair in every color.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Anything with Gina Torres gets my vote. The writing is outstanding, the acting is fantastic,  directing is phenomenal, I usually only like scifi stuff too. What a great brake from redundant dr shows and cop investing ncis bla bla bla... I feel like I can relate to every character I've seen! The show is almost clean enough for the whole family, but not quite there. The only thing that would make it better would be if it were in space. =-O
B005NFWCSK|2.0|Full of meaningless sexual references and nudity. Mutant powers were more like super powers. Far fetched even for xmen. I enjoyed the other movies but this one was full of Hollywood  bafoonary.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Very fun book, really enjoyed it! I read an article complaining about most modern movies having the same plot following roughly Blake's Beats, however after reading the book myself Blake encouraged anything but the same old thing. This book is a wealth of really good story telling techniques specifically for the movie format. So glad I picked it up and so sorry I never learned about it sooner. A fantastic legacy...
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Detailed descriptions of these unlikely and unglamorous protagonists and the rural Irish culture in which they live make them likable and understandable.  McKenna does a good job of helping the reader understand their motivations through her gradually revealing their backstories.  A well-written and uplifting &#34;romance'.
B000JML90Y|3.0|It was interesting to read this early work on natural selection. I'm interested in biology, so I do think it was an interesting subject.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|I just watched this movie for the sixth time (four of those times in the past month, and I wasn't at all bored).  I've been a huge film buff for five decades and rarely give a movie 5 stars, but this is right up there with Silver Linings Playbook, Dances with Wolves, Big, and Love Actually.  All the principal actors were perfectly cast and are an absolute joy to watch.  It's a funny and touching film about friendship and love.  I found myself smiling through most of the movie.  I would highly recommend giving this movie a chance.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|This is my favorite season so much history regarding Queen Anne. I just love this period! So if you like Queen Anne this is the one for you!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|While the ending is perfect, there are too many chapters of pain for the boys at the orphanage. Dialogue was fun to read, as I'm not Irish.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|This Is a great album this was one of the top albums of The 80's decade Thriller was the most album to have it has several great song Wanna be starting something, Beat it, Billie Jean and of course The Some Thrill it was a great song and Awesome Video. If your just starting to listen to Michael Jackson defiantly buy this album.If You are a big fan this is a must have album for your collection.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book starts off  like that other familiar chart topper that shall not be named. Not that I didn't like that one but this one to me blew it out of the ball park. This story was more in depth and the characters each were so much more interesting. I wanted to read interactions with them just as much as the main characters. I've read the last three books and cannot wait for the next one. Buy this book. You will be glad you did.
B009GEDP26|5.0|I started watching castle on TNT reruns this summer for the first time, I had never watch the series before, I really like it and think it really earns the 5 stars, Season 5 is the best of the seasons.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|Have been a fan if Transfomers since they debuted as a cartoon in the '80s. To have all 3 dvds is a dream come true!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very interesting thought provoking book. I did wonder sometimes about how the author kept to some of his conclusions. I did NOT find it &#34;anti Christian&#34;
0062255657|5.0|This book tops out at less than two hundred pages, but it is one of Gaiman's most beautiful works.  I loved Stardust, and I love The Ocean at the End of the Lane. I know Neil Gaiman is not an indie, and this makes two weeks in a row that I have strayed from the indie path. This is a truly wonderful book, and well worth reading.<br /><br />Not much of a blurb, but the wonderful, mysterious title sold me the book.  The tale that is revealed within the pages of this book stayed with me long after I had finished. The lyrical prose is pure Gaiman at his best. I have frequently felt his work will bring back a new appreciation for the art of beautiful words, neatly crafted and wrapped in wonderful plots. There are no sixty-second sound-bites of action in this book--it is instead a true fairytale, taking us to bad places where bad things can happen and good people sometimes suffer terrible consequences.<br /><br />The main protagonist is never named, so far as I could see. The unnamed protagonist returns to his childhood hometown for the funeral of a close family member, also not named. There he revisits the home in which he and his sister grew up and remembers his friend, Lettie Hempstock, who always said that the pond behind her house was an ocean.<br /><br />He stops at the house where Lettie had lived with her mother and grandmother and encounters her mother. He begins to remember long-forgotten incidents from the past. He recalls a time when he was a child of only seven years old. A man he and his family knew stole his father's car and committed suicide in the back seat, having gambled away his friends' money. Somehow, his suicide allowed a supernatural being to enter our world.<br /><br />The Hempstock women have magic, but they aren't witches.  They are much more than that, and the magic they do has its roots firmly based in the solid physics of the universe, in quarks and electrons and time itself.<br /><br />The atmosphere is dark and frightening in this tale, but it is also comfortable, like a fire on a chill night. The contrasting moods of the boy's struggling home life and the old-fashioned, cozy farmhouse Lettie lives in are woven into the story with delicacy, flowing naturally and forming the background of the protagonist's memories of a terrifying time in his life.<br /><br />This is a stunning, harsh tale; frightening and yet comforting in a strange way. There is beauty here among the sometimes ugly facts of a lonely young boy's life.<br /><br />I confess I did pay $9.99 for the Kindle download, and then I read the book in one day. It was well worth it, and I will do it again for his next book!it is also comfortable, like a fire on a chill night.

B005IZLPMY|5.0|This is a great deal for the combo pack and you can't go wrong having both formats. This is the best way to purchase a movie.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|As the header says - BRILLIANT !<br />The writers bring us into a family of very real people from the very beginning.  Fully fleshed out characters as though they were each the star of the show and there were no supporting roles.<br />AND;<br />The writers and actors bring us into the real world of the problems.  Meaning when someone is homeless for example, it's not some sort of 'oh Jesse is on the streets with no where to go' and fade out to new scene.  No, the viewer is brought into the moment fully.  Without ever becoming boring, the viewer stands with Jesse through almost every desperate phone call he makes, being thrown out my his buddy's wife, and more (I don't want to spoil that episode for anyone).  In short, there are no glossed over scenes and you feel as though you are with that person experiencing every minutia of cleaning up a soupy, deceased body which has fallen through a ceiling for instance.<br /><br />I could simply not recommend this series any more.
B003TQ50V6|5.0|Great movie.  I am 56 years old, and this reminds me of the &#34;Good guys always win&#34; westerns I watched as a kid.  Good acting, even from &#34;young&#34; Kevin Costner.  Had seen it before, but recently bought a Henry rifle, and &#34;got a hankerin&#34; to watch it again.  A timeless classic!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The viewer really cares about these characters and the difficulties they're having adjusting to the new world order following WWI.  The storyline tracks what is happening in society through the microcosm of life on one estate.  Casting is superb and attention to detail is  paramount.  Best ever Masterpiece!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I really liked the game, but it is a little hard to figure out what to do.  Not much in the way of instructions.  I guess if you are used to gaming it wouldn't be as big a problem, but I'm a techno dinosaur.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|From the get go this film is highly provocative. While the plot wasn't hard to rush till the end I, sat there pretty intrigued... mostly because of the fantastically creepy soundtrack. I truly believe if, it were not for the soundtrack that the film would be more towards the mediocre side. I was horrified at the ending. Period.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Enjoyed the old version.  Never had any freezing issues before this update.  Cant force kill app to save battery and process speed.  Uninstalled
B00DIFARQ6|3.0|It's fun to play but once you get through the first part you have to come up with $5.00 to keep playing.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Cat and Bones are such a wonderful couple the book takes you to a real fantasy world that is exciting
B007EECSFA|4.0|I have read several of Kate Morton's books.  She did not disappoint.  I knew there was a twist to the storyline, but I didn't put it together until the end.  It kept my attention through the entire book.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a novel through flashbacks.  I like the way Kate Morton flips between the present and the past, although this one told the story through the eyes of several people instead of one.
B007N8RULO|1.0|Played one game and was starting my second game and received a notice that there was a virus in the game.  I \\"debugged\\" my Kindle and removed the game.  Not something I would recommend to anyone and I do recommend that Amazon remove it from the Apps store.  Fun game with a \\"creepy crawly\\" ending!
B00797MB0O|1.0|I like Charlize Theron usually but MAN. This movie really sucked. She's not even a young adult! She's like 37 and trying to break up her high school boyfriend's marriage to a much cooler chick. Not worth your time.
B008602KQI|5.0|I'd watch this over and over. It is a great adaptation of the book and I love the casting. So awesome.
B008Y73940|5.0|Matthew McConaughey was perfect for the part. Some strange bedfellows and Interesting legal strategies with a little surprise. At times unsettling, but with a justice had been served good feel ending.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|This application has allowed me to keep my schedule up to date and on time. As i get older, thr reminder function is a godsend. Once it is<br /><br />on<br /> the app, it is set in stone. Easy to use. Easy to navigate. Your world at your fingertips. Great for the&#34; anal retentive&#34;.
0064471837|5.0|Featuring one of the most breathtakingly original and evocative magic systems in years (drawing on a whole untapped world of bell folklore and superstition for inspiration) and a cast of vividly drawn and beautifully flawed and broken characters, Sabriel is one of the finest pieces of speculative fiction to ever come from an Australian author. Not only is the writing itself achingly beautiful and the plot superbly drawn but it sets up a vivid and highly unusual (but still wholly believable) which is a pleasure to return to not only by rereading but also in the equally brilliant sequels.<br /><br />I first read Sabriel several years after its publication and so was lucky enough not to have to wait to devour its sequels, and I still own those original copies of the Old Kingdom trilogy and reread them on a more or less yearly basis - Sabriel has a well-earned place on my list of 10 favourite speculative fiction works and I cannot recommend it highly enough provided that you are unbothered by gore, imagery related to dead things and depictions of the afterlife (as well as Lovecraftian cat-creatures).<br /><br />11/10.
034580709X|5.0|A wonderfully-engrossing book that gives vital backstory to the Harry Hole saga.  Some of the best mysteries around, by a terrific author.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|this is the only one I have tried and it does what it says it can do so I like it.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Love the game, but then again who doesn't. They've done a good job with the format of this game but the amount of in-app purchase is ridiculous since you have to have tokens to play and if y oh want to play three times to five times in a row you pretty much have no other choice than buying.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|while watching the Pilot I was a little worried I was too much of a wimp to watch this. Decided to view the second episode and I'm hooked!!! The character are well thought out and so is the story line. I don't feel like they are trying too hard, and they bring certain things to resolution in a timely manner. I hate when they drag certain plots on too long.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great collection of puzzles.  There are a few that are unsolvable without using the hint feature. L
B00116GHMM|5.0|I really like how side A is really pretty and Side B makes me want to sit in the dark and cogitate about life, and kind of cry.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|I wouldnt waset my time downloading this, has no functionality and i started gettign spam on my kindle after using it one time.  Takes forever to load for me.  And to all the folks downrating this review... you are probably the creators of this junk APP, so your opinion doesnt count.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|4.5 stars. Victoria doesn't start out as a heroine, but ends up as one. The story is told from two time points: starting with her \\"emancipation\\" from being a ward of the state, as she ages out at age 18, and at age 10, going to her last-chance foster-home-to-adoption placement, having been placed in a series of foster homes since being abandoned as an infant.<br /><br />Victoria is, on the surface, a thistle - the symbol of misanthropy, hate for the whole world, as her foster-mother Elizabeth tells her, after Victoria has placed cactus spikes in Elizabeth's shoes. Cactus stands not for hate, but for ardent love.<br /><br />Slowly, we learn to understand why Victoria is so prickly and defensive, and why, despite herself, Elizabeth gets through to her, partly through teaching her the language of flowers. Victoria uses this, her one talent/gift, to obtain a position in a florist's shop, and soon after, is making up \\"message\\" flower arrangements for brides and others that seem to bring into their lives the missing elements.<br /><br />Later, Victoria ends by abandoning her own baby daughter - or does she? My only nit to pick is that Grant seems a little too good to be true - he's patient, kind, smart, and does not seem to carry a grudge about his mistreatment by anybody.<br /><br />I think it's a terrific, if often heartbreaking book. Learning about the flower symbology is a brilliant thread that holds it all together and is fascinating in its own right, and in the end, I was cheering for Victoria to have a happy ending.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|This was really hyped up and I really enjoy a good science fiction movie but for me this one fell flat. Maybe not as flat as Jack Reacher but pretty close.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the most well written books as well a great concept and story. Would recommend to all readers of any age
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|It's alright but I wish I'd waited for it to come out on cable instead of paying $4.99 to watch it. Got a good movie? It'd be a lot cooler if you did.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|Another great show and now the two follow up books that weren't made into movies so have to read.  Do not care for the reader, very blah.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Great movie, great acting and great plot.  Matthew should be nominated for an Oscar for sure.  You should watch it!
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|Walk to this music, great, great kids need more shows like this, good clean entertainment, what a fun school, they should all be this way..
B005PK1G76|5.0|this holds my drink, my son's sippy cup, his snack, my snack, keys, phone and wallet. I love it. Very durable
147674355X|5.0|What a page turner! I read the entire book in less than two nights.  You feel the characters emotions and pain, and their personalities are so clear through the way Colleen describes them that you feel as if you know them in the real life. I felt attached to Sky by the end of the story and missed her when I finished the book.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read.
0764574124|5.0|The book came in the allotted time and in the condition that was described. Haven't used the book too much yet but I'm sure it'll be useful. Thanks!
B0016OOS16|4.0|I love setting my laptop on my knees, then rotating and translating objects in my CAD program with the SpaceNavigator!  It is intuitive enough to hand off to clients to let them examine the model.  I consider this an essential piece of gear.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Does the job well enough for what it is, but doesn't replace a larger higher quality sharpener. Three more words.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Similar to sim city. Plan to spend some $ to get started and share on Facebook. Overall seems like a decent game.
B001EBYM8A|4.0|My son had never seen this movie and it had been about 10 years since I last saw this all the way through. This is one of the greatest chase movies ever, but the reason it is not a 5 star movie is that the last scene is about 10 minutes too long.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Received quickly and it was in great condition and have watched all included discs so far and have yet to find a problem with anything in this purchase.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Especially interesting and informative if you have a loved one who experienced a similar situation.  Helps with the feeling of helplessness of not knowing what to expect or what to do to help.  Especially loved the list at the end of things that can help a person who has experienced a brain hemorrhage.
B00BV1OT0O|4.0|I just wanted some little reminder of Despicable Me to make me smile during the day, and this fits the bill.  Since he's rubberized plastic, I can was any dust and dirt off easily.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|That Richard Dean Anderson is not one of my favorite actors so SG1 was kinda blah for me. Now Stargate Atlantis found me more engrossed and I ended up watching the full series so I am now a fan.
B0011U5DY6|5.0|For the passe' Marley fan who is introduced to his work through a greatest hits album will miss out if they do not give this album a try.  Survival is more politcally charge than a greatest hits or essential album will want to get into, but this is one of my all-time favorite Marley albums for jut that reason...a hidden gem.
B004EAQNO4|5.0|This movie (seen it twice) is more of a head trip then an all out horror. While it gets to the scares it also is a tale of whodoneit! I really liked the way each character was portrayed, at once you had some sympathy for each one of them then you changed your mind after the killing started so it left me somewhat confused as to the real killer which ended up being what mattered most about the film. I love tense paranormal movies especially those that border on demonic possession and this one made the grade!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved theses three books...I'm not much of a book reader but everyone was raving over how good an &#34;sexy&#34; this trilogy was so I decided why not see for myself. I began reading the first one an got so interested in it that I couldn't lay it down...it was like it consumed my life an I couldn't quit until I had finished all three books. I surprised myself how interested I was an how much I really loved reading this story. I would recommend this trilogy over an over...it is awesome an &#34;mind blowing&#34;. My only objective to it is that now I have finished reading them an I want &#34;more&#34;... I wish there were more to read I just want it to keep going an going an never end!!!!!
B0050XFY4O|5.0|I really liked this, I was expecting more of a hand biter regarding the intimacy issues and the relationship these guys had with their parents but it ended up being very sexy and not at all so out there that you are uncomfortable with the theme.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's fun trying to figure it out.  It makes you think.  I would definitely. recommend this game to others.  Can't. wait until new levels come out.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching season one and was hooked. Had not seen any of it on TV, so I was excited to be able to get it free because of my  kindle with PRIME. The programs streamed smoothly..no long wait to load, and no refreshing. I will probably catch up with a few other series, now that I know how great this is.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I'm really into the trilogy and got all the extra movies and a cool little case. At A great price too :-)
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I was so interested , I went ahead and ordered number 3, which I thoughtly enjoyed.  I am patiently waiting for season 4 in Jan
B0057ZAA0S|1.0|It doesn't work on my blu ray player, apparently its the wrong zone. I thought the point of blu ray was not just better quality but no zones, guess not
B000002QWD|5.0|The CD is better quality than I thought it would be.  I am very pleased with the product although the case became cracked during shipping.  Bing Crosby is a wonderful artist.  I just love his singing.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I don't really use this that much at the game but I don't really use it might somehow that up for me. Joe
B005G4TJUC|5.0|As an adult, I still love the transformers.  Having the voice of Leonard Nimoy in this one just made it better for me!  I hope they have a reason to make more movies!
B005DJREJS|3.0|It was good and it was kind of funny I liked it but why don't you get to keep it?
B003P2WO5E|5.0|After reading the Mistborn series, and Alloy of Law, a friend told me about Way of Kings, so I started it, and it started a bit slow but quickly picks up and becomes a must read from a great writer.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great light weight YA read. Writing was pleasant and storyline better than anticipated. I am going to read the rest of the series, I hope it is as well written.
0553801473|5.0|Just another great addition to the great series, I can't wait to read Winds of Winter, and see how everything pans out and who dies next.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me laugh and cry and everything in between. At first, I didn't really like the characters and they seemed far-fetched, but then it became this  beautiful love story that just seemed so real. Great book, that always left me thinking.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. I play it while I'm at the barn, at home, and the park. It's very addicting. I'm glad I found it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game.  I am not any good at it.  So I haven't been very far in the game.  Keep running into the trains.  So I don't know what is in the game later on.  I do like it and keep playing it.  Over and over again.  Maybe one day.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have been playing Magic for 20 years and I love it. This is an excellent way to play Magic on my Note II.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Julian Fellowes scores again with another season of Downton.  I find the characters excellently drawn, the acting wonderful and the chance to listen to Maggie Smith's lines and delivery unbeatable.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|The Metal Gear series is one of the most consistently amazing series release after release, with top notch gameplay, graphics, and a captivating (if not incredibly convoluted) story spanning multiple games and decades.<br /><br />From 1987's Metal Gear for the MSX to 2010's Peace Walker, this is the complete no BS Metal Gear collection.<br /><br />A must own.
B009POCG5Y|2.0|The movie's only saving grace is that Amy Adams gives one of the year's best performances. She just leaps off the screen and it's hard to take one's eyes off her in this picture. You've seen all the rest before in a number of sports movies.
B00632HWOG|4.0|My daughter passed on her kindle to me as a gift.  I love the kindle.  Yahoo is one of my mail staples and is so easy to use here.  Good app, works seamlessly and allows me to move through various accounts.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|This show is good for laying around on a rainy day and catching up on but I'm only on the second season and usually watch it as background noise.  Some of the effects are dated and the sexual tension between the doctor and rose Tyler isn't really there.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|WE were both so thrilled to watch this series. We spent an entire weekend eager to see what would happen next. A wonderful work of art. Looking forward to more in the future.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I am so in love with this album! I am a photographer and from the moment John's music and voice started to fill my room, my head was flooded with visual images that I must make come to life through photography. I haven't been so motivated with fresh inspiration in such a long time. Gorgeous delicious fabulous inspiration. Earthy, folksy, soul lighting! -- I LOVE IT!

B00CWV8X04|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie. Good story, some surprises to keep things interesting, & great cast.  Would watch it again!
B008M7BQHE|5.0|I found this entire series to be excellent.  The third season is no different.  Fringe as a whole had a good plot, well developed characters, and complex and dynamic storyline.
B000023VR8|5.0|Just what imagined, (actually better than I imagine) 180g vinyl with digital download voucher!  Definitively an improvement over the CD.
1842171593|5.0|This book has it all, almost.<br />It really has a vast and great amount of pieces of equipment, all archaeological finds well represented here, they are the main source material for these studies. Almost none illustrations of soldiers, but there are other books to cover that area. This is an excellent reference book for smiths and serious re-enactors who really want their every single piece of equipment to be as accurate as possible. There is none better book for that around. Or maybe H. Russell Robinsons The Armour of Imperial Rome, fro year 1975, out of print, no reprints ever and costs about 300 if you even can find it anywhere. That is quite old and many new things have been found after it, but there is none books which would have better selection of helmets ad helmet parts (particularly cheek-pieces) that Robinsons's book, but this Roman Military Equipment comes really close. Recommendable for every keen enthusiast, certainly not for beginners!
B006C1DH92|1.0|Refuses to load without network. This is absurd, since it used to work just fine. If it won't work in airplane mode, it's not worth having.
B0011AQLZQ|5.0|This is a magical movie based on a book that ignited millions of children to pick up giant books and read them! It is a classic and anyone can watch it and fall in love!

B003QTSMXE|2.0|I really can't say I liked this movie. Not much going on. Maybe kids would like it more. I generally like animation but it wasn't engaging enough for me.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is written like a first class suspense novel! If you like movies like sense & sensibility, this is like an updated version. It's English charm & English arrogance, all rolled into one!
0375869026|5.0|If you know a child in middle school or early high school, and they respect your opinion about good books, hand them a copy of this book. I disagree with those who say it should be required reading for middle schoolers. Required? Don't you remember the ball-and-chain drudgery that placed on otherwise wonderful books? Requiring books to be read for school takes the life out of them, sometimes. The better option is what I recommend in the first sentence. Pass it on to a child and tell them it will open their eyes to some things ... because it will.<br /><br />There are so many challenges inherent in writing a story about a child with August's kind of affliction. The author dances through them with easy grace. By shifting point of view, she crafts her characters into real people with both failings and virtues. Like Susan Creech's \\"Walk Two Moons\\", this book is all about understanding someone else by seeing life through their eyes. Sometimes our friends act like jerks because they spoke without thinking. Sometimes we're the ones saying the wrong things. When these moments happen in the book, you recognize and remember the gritty reality of friendships in your own life.<br /><br />The author placed herself in a tough spot by the end. If the story had a \\"happy\\" ending, people might grouse about its airy-fairy take on a serious social problem. On the other hand, a \\"tragic\\" ending would be seen as so depressingly real that people would \\"wonder\\" why they bothered. I won't give away the end, but Ms. Palacio chose the right path in this reviewer's humble opinion.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I have lost over 40.00 on this game.  I buy credits and on 3 occasions I received nothing.  They never do anything about it!  Always give me a song and dance!  Don't waste your money!
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Such a great and inspirational story.  Would highly recommend this movie to everyone.  Not much more to say about this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|i thought this series was wonderful. absolutely loved it. i wish it kept going so i could find out what happened next! great new author to keep an eye out for
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game my niece loves this game she laughs like crazy my nephews also love it, it is a great game, I play every day.
B009JVSAVM|1.0|I ordered the Seasons 1-5 set of Big Bang Theory because it's one of my favorite shows of all time. Seasons 1-4 played fine. The quality is great, and I thoroughly enjoyed the extras. However, 2 of the 3 disks in the Season 5 set will not play in either of two DVD players in my household. Season 5 was packaged separately from the rest (1-4 were shrink-wrapped together), so perhaps that's why the first 4 seasons were okay.<br /><br />I'm even more disappointed to see that amazon's return policy means that I missed the window to return this DEFECTIVE product by ... 7 days. I will have to find a more reliable way to obtain quality DVDs.<br /><br />(edited 08/27/13): In fairness to Amazon, I must add that they treated me fairly in responding to my complaint about this defective product. It was annoying to deal with DVDs that wouldn't play, but the issue was resolved as well as it could have been, under the circumstances.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Easy to play. It is very addictive. The quests rang from easy to difficult.

B008C20TDG|5.0|It's a step-by-step, informative and easy to understand guide to a new lifestyle. The book is designed in a simple but neat way with each chapter to deeply and profoundly inform you about single important element of the lifestyle. Even if you think you won't go through the program I would recommend it for better understanding of the impact different food has on your body. Well written, motivating and encouraging!
B00DGXGUSY|4.0|I only enjoy listening to a few of the songs on this (Deceiver of the Gods, As Loke Falls, Under Siege), but for any serious Amon Amarth fan, it's a must-have. This is my 6th Album from them.

B004C3DLJS|1.0|With Toy Story 3, Pixar has achieved a feat I would never in a million years have thought possible - except this time, that is no compliment. The first two Toy Story films were both staples of my childhood and among Pixar's great accomplishments (and this is saying quite a lot, as they have many). Unfortunately, the value of those films has been tarnished by a pointless and depressing third installment that misses the mark entirely. Let me be clear - it's a rarity for Pixar to make a bad film. And Toy Story 3, while inferior in quality to the previous installments, isn't by any means poorly-made. It's just a story I happen to disagree with.<br /><br />Before I had reached the ending, I found the movie to be okay (considering it was the sequel of a sequel) although it couldn't hold a candle to the previous two. It was somewhat lower on character development, not really revealing anything about the main characters while introducing new ones who generally remained underdeveloped and added nothing to the plot. The script didn't sparkle as much thanks to the relative absence of the hilarious one-liners which had partly defined the other films. Woody's fight with the monkey was only filler and didn't tie into the rest of the plot like the battle with Zurg in Toy Story 2 did. The main villain was indeed strange, as his motivation made little sense. He devotes his life to making other toys miserable with the justification of, &#34;We're all just junk for getting thrown out!&#34; This is because his owner has abandoned him - entirely by mistake, however, as he is well aware.<br /><br />But then the ending came and what respect I had for the film dropped to nil. I felt as if the whole series had been dumped down a giant garbage incinerator. It seemed to be saying that to grow up, you have to stamp out every little remnant of your childhood - even your most treasured possessions - something I disagree with strongly. What is an adulthood, devoid of the celebration and remembrance of childhood? I felt as if some pathetic nihilist was trying to force their view of life on me, that this was the ending the makers of the film wanted, not that the audience wanted.<br /><br />Anyway, aren't adults supposed to be part of the audience of these movies? If we can take these toys into our adulthoods with us, then why the heck shouldn't Andy ever see them again? Why not have an ending that completes what the first two movies were doing: offering us adults back a little piece of our childhoods? Instead of asking us to leave everything we gained from these films behind us?<br /><br />Some fans insist we needn't take the ending literally. The problem is that to give a literal demonstration of something should be precisely the film's purpose, just as Toy Story 1 and 2 were meant to show how children actually think of their toys. I agree, there are some things we must let go of as we grow up, but this is a film about toys, not toys that merely serve as a stand-in for some other part of childhood we really do need to permanently lose.<br /><br />There is also something else problematic. Wasn't the whole point of Toy Story 2 that Woody chose to accept the inevitability of his abandonment? That movie centers around Woody's fear of returning home to Andy, after he realizes that Andy will one day grow up and put him away on the shelf, like Wheezy. At one point, Stinky Pete even asks Woody if he really thinks Andy will take Woody on his honeymoon, which implies that Woody would still belong to Andy after college. Finally, Woody realizes the right thing to do is to go back to Andy. The film ends with him declaring that he's accepted everything won't last forever, but he will just enjoy it while it does.<br /><br />All that being said, I don't believe I would have preferred a film which ended with these toys being forced to spend over a decade in Andy's attic. Perhaps it simply isn't possible to make a satisfying Toy Story film with a grown-up Andy. This series worked best when it was confined to exploring childhood, and perhaps it should have stayed there. Otherwise, what's next? Christopher Robin getting rid of Winnie the Pooh? Calvin getting rid of Hobbes?perhaps it should have stayed there. Otherwise, what's next? Christopher Robin getting rid of Winnie the Pooh? Calvin getting rid of Hobbes?
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I really enjoy watching an episode or 2 each night before bedtime and always look forward to the next episode.  The acting is good.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I have never reviewed a book before (and I read A LOT) but this book did it for me. Absolutely fantastic! I read this book in two days; I wish I would have read slower, I just couldn't put it down. I love the story, the characters and their real life issues. The end of the book did it in for me... makes you stop and take another look at life. I will suggest this book to all my family and friends.
B00CBKXGPI|3.0|I enjoyed the game until it began shutting itself down randomly.  It definitely has problems running on Kindle Fire. You can play it but you have to put ups the game freezing and closing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game to play with some downtime.  Can go at your own pace -solve all levels as fast or slow as you want...... just challenging enough to get your thinking skills revved up.
B00B9366VO|5.0|I bought the cd first and then watched the movie. Both are fantastic and are must see and listen to material. Thanks David!
0061537934|5.0|Great book.  Kind of a tear jerker in parts but some good life lessons in this book that are applicable to personal and business.
1603580557|5.0|Thinking in Systems is a must read for anyone involved in the arduous, messy and unpredictable trade of social change. Although there are other books that purport to tell you \\"how to change the world,\\" Dana Meadows actually provides a compass on how to get there. Not a roadmap. Not a blueprint. It can't be distilled down to \\"do this.\\" It's more of an approach, a way of perceiving and interacting with the world that enables one to see the various parts of the system--including the meta-system and subsystems--in which one operates. In order to understand any social problem, we must first understand how we got here, the way things operate, and the leverage points in the system that *might* produce change in the direction we desire.<br /><br />There are quite a few tools in this book to aid the nascent and inveterate systems thinkers. The chapter on leverage points alone is worth the price of the book. An especially trenchant insight is the exhortation to focus on delays of different types in a given system. The example of the car dealership in chapter two is particularly instructive on this front. The final chapter in the book is especially notable in that the author was brave and humble enough to admit her own initial hyper-optimism that systems thinking could easily change the world and the harsh realities of working in a world where few understand or care about systems.<br /><br />I've easily read at least 500 non-fiction books over the past decade. Thinking in Systems easily is in the top 2% of books I've read over the past 10 years in terms of its usefulness and likelihood to change how I engage with the world over the next decade.

B000P0J09M|1.0|Do not buy the single disc edition!<br /><br />Buyer beware! If you are planning on buying this movie, avoid the single disc edition. The disc is cheap, and you have to flip it halfway through the movie. Half the movie is one side, half is on the other. It is also presented in a \\"windowboxed\\" widescreen format, which is incorrectly stated on the back of the DVD as \\"enhanced for widescreen TVs\\". I don't have any idea why Amazon sells it, or why they don't feel the need to list these issues in the product description. I'm just going to return this to Amazon and get the 2-disc version anyway, so I don't know why this piece of crap is even still available.<br /><br />Overall - the movie itself is 5/5, but the awful DVD is 1/5.
B002R5QPRI|4.0|I had been wanting to see this movie for quite some time and finally had a bit of time to do just that, so I settled back to enjoy what had been a very hyped movie but I found it did not live up to the hype.  The stilted romance between the two leading characters left something to be desired, no pun intended.  What spoiled part of the ending of the film for me was that I was able to pick out the stalker almost as soon as he appeared in the film and from there the suspense was broken.  If you like thrillers or mystery stories and are accustomed to picking up on who the bad guy is, you should have no trouble picking up on the stalker in this film.  I won't tell though, for the sake of those who aren't accustomed to this genre of film and who may not recognize the telltale signs of a villain when they are written all over the screen.  It's an enjoyable film, but not one worthy of an Oscar, and apparently the Academy Awards agreed with that evaluation.  Still, it's worth watching and I got my money's worth.

He's labeled the master of horror but seems to keep putting out love like story's. although this one isn't really a love story it's far from scary. I was excited for this one picturing in my head monsters at a carnival how creepy. Ahhh all it dealt with was devin healing his heart working as a carny and entertaining kids in a dog costume.  I think Stephen king could still make wonderfully scary stories if he would just stop with this bull s***.  Every time I read one of novels all I can't think is how did he go from writting about a demonic clown living in a sewer to this garbage.  I think until he delivers more demons and monsters ill just re read the shinning and pet semetary.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was so into this series I watched all three seasons in one weekend! I Can't wait for season four!
1451695187|4.0|Very medical difficult for lay person but intersting -- passed to a couple of nurses and a Dr. in my church.  The Dr. knew your father when he worked at Wake Forest Hospital.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game has a good plot and great story line. The graphics are good but a little fuzzy on the in game videos. I really liked the seek and find though. Overall a good game for distraction.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|No updates that are shown on the website available for the kindle fire hd. That is weird considering the hd is very popular. Cannot connect to Facebook and in order to complete some quests you have to spend money.  Quests like that should have a skip feature. Not  made to where you must spend real money or just keep the quest. Fix your game please or just remove it.
1592332803|2.0|I LOVE Colleen Patrick-Goudreau's podcasts so I thought I'd give her cookbooks a try. I recieved this book as a birthday present from my fiance and was super excited to get crackin' at these recipes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing I've tried so far has been very tasty. The chocolate cake was very dry, the cookie recipes were really, really oily. The soda bread was not very good unless you smothered it in Earth Balance and some jam. The only thing I've really been okay with so far was the Mediterranian bread, but it wasn't anything to rave about either.<br /><br />Very dissapointed. Will still work through this book's recipes, but so far the outlook is grim.
1781162646|5.0|As a huge Stephen King fan I have read (or listened to) & own nearly all of his books, audio books and eBooks.  I think he has really evolved over the years and I am really enjoying his departure from bizarre horror stuff and into more serious fiction with just a sprinkling of horror.  I could read 10 more like this one.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|As usual, Tom cruise does a great job in this futuristic, mind blowing film that will have you guessing throughout the entire film. I would recommend this film to any SCI-FI lover.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|Never played this puzzle before this app. Picked it up when it was the free app of the day and now it's on all my devices. Works well for me being able to work on it during my workday without trying to beat a clock. Relaxing but challenging. Landscape presentation would be nice, but absolutely a solid app. Well done, worth buying.
0345525558|5.0|This is a very interesting read which offers a rare insight into the world of foster children who have been bounced from family to family without making any lasting connections.  Victoria is a very damaged young lady who tries, with varying degrees of success, to acknowledge her anger/fear/self-destructive behavior, and work through it to find happiness.  Well-written and cleverly crafted, this novel will not disappoint.
0062238868|5.0|He talked about this book for a while and was pleased and surprised when I got it for him. He loved it. Thank you!
B00164GDD2|5.0|I mean honestly, what else is there to say. this is one of the all time classics with Caddy shack!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This is another page turner.  I always love Sparks books.  Having lived in North Carolina's they are very real to me.  A must read.
B0053TWV46|4.0|if you're buying this its bc you know about this movie and you know how good it is. Brings you back to your childhood :)
B008OOYALE|4.0|This games only problem is it takes too long to evolve grow and hatch you dragon. But it's fun and addicting I love this game but it needs a place to store your items
B007AL48UK|5.0|This is a great app, it really gets my mind working and is a lot of fun!! Just can't let my hubby play or I will never get my Kindle back.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Had heard about it from friends...in another state.so i could not borrow.<br />Went on line found a copy through Hastings. Have ordered from them before. Their movies are always packed for protection and always arrives ...in a timely manner.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|Exactly like the old kind but much brighter, takes 4 &#34;D&#34; batteries and lasts a long time. I keep them around the house for power outages, safer than candles, and easy to grab and walk around with.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm app is the best I've found so this is very helpfull for waking up in the mornings so THIS DESERVES THE BEST.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Like other people who've read about the issues and events leading up to World War II, I have know that there was strong isolationist sentiment in the United States. The majority of American people simply did not want to get involved in another European war. Olson tells the story of how that sentiment began to change as Europe fell under Hitler's control. On one side was the Roosevelt administration trying to get the country--and the Congress--ready for a war they felt we couldn't avoid. On the other side was American hero Charles Lindbergh and other conservatives who genuinely believed involving America in another European war would lead to the country's downfall. Those Angry Days is a fascinating read that tells the story of the war between these two factions--and how that war reflected not only the strength but the complexity of the American character. It is fascinating read. Anyone who wants to know how modern day America came to be will find the roots of today's culture were planted in the period Olson so well illuminates.
B00CLT31D6|4.0|Depressing! MONEY is not everything  . GOD will provide for all your needs. Happiness is found in the people you love, the church you attend, and the people you help.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Thank You - love it a lot - do not like having to count words to be able to respoind
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Amazing graphics, good game, can play for hours won't be bored of this game...I would recommend it to anyone that like strategy ^_^
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|A wonderful and youthful voice with hints of Tom Petty, Roy Orbison and Sheryl Crow. I can't wait for additional work from this rising star.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved this game. it was challenging yet easy to understand. each room was different and it was interesting to see how everything fell into place. I wish there was more levels!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is a pretty simple game.  The graphics are fairly basic but that doesn't mean it isn't tones of fun to play.  Basically the guy with the jetpack is moving as the screen does and you move him up and down(fire his jet pack) by touching the screen so you can jump over obstacles, many of which will kill you instantly. A lot of random stuff appear in the game each time you replay it, for example one time I got a Harley motorbike and started shooting everyone, another I was in some weird electric pod.  Of course most of the game you are playing as a guy with a jetpack on.  I only owned this for a day but it's lots of fun so far!<br /><br />You can play this when you are not connected to Wi-Fi which is great, it also gives you some how to play instructions the first time you play it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I always hated reading but after i started the first book I couldn't put it down. These books are so well written. When I finished i was kind of mad, because I love katniss and want her story to never end.
B00D9DCSGY|4.0|It really helped me appreciate the story more to see how hard they really did work on this and showed me that one idea can lead to amazing things.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|The Greatest Poet Alive(G.P.A.) has done it again. Revenge of the Orgasm jumps off the pages and right in front of you as this master of sensuality weaves through these escapades which would make any man envious and women aroused. G.P.A. has a way of describing sensual and sexual acts without giving it to your raw like most without his adeptness would do. If you have not read Revenge of the Orgasm, you are missing out. It is a sensual masterpiece.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This is a great movie. I had seen it in the theater and wanted it for my home collection. It was just as good the second time around!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game ever<br />coolest thing funniest awesome right now to I look good the sed red type uh oh ano
B00005N5S5|5.0|This is a great movie. I had seen it in the theater and wanted it for my home collection. It was just as good the second time around!
0062278096|5.0|I love the chapters &#34;By the Book,&#34; where we learn how the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories were adapted for the series.  Best tidbits:  sticky notes from Sherlock, Mycroft, and John in John's &#34;notebook.&#34;
B005PTYP70|5.0|This is a great movie. I had seen it in the theater and wanted it for my home collection. It was just as good the second time around!
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I love how the characters are real with likes and dislikes of people like us.  I like that they are put in situations that makes promises broken and those around them.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|This is a great movie. I had seen it in the theater and wanted it for my home collection. It was just as good the second time around!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Follows the book very well.  The casting is great, as well as the actors.  Brings the characters in the book to life.
B00008973A|5.0|This is a great movie. I had seen it in the theater and wanted it for my home collection. It was just as good the second time around!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Things you probably should have been exposed to before being asked to accept Christianity merely on faith. Some amazing research but you wouldn't have to dig deep discover a lot of contradictions you should have realized.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|This is a great movie. I had seen it in the theater and wanted it for my home collection. It was just as good the second time around!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I have watched the Big Bang Theory since it first started.  Time after time I have watched the season re-runs.  Just as funny!  There is nothing on TV like this show and it is at least kind of clean, for todays standards!
B000059ZLH|5.0|In spite of what many have already said about the psychedelic pseudo-effects (if they could just delete those effects and give us only the raw footage at some point in the form of a special edition or something, that would be SO GREAT!!), this is one of the best live music shows ever recorded. Everyone's at the peak of their performance on this one!! Over 3 hours of DT live performance!! This is a proggressive music classic!! Enjoy
B00CA4S3UI|5.0|Simply buy it. It's one of the best cd I bought recently. I have over 2.000 cds and this one will figure out in the top x list. I do recommend for Malmsteen fans, Hard Rock and Power Metal. The second song with Ralf Scheepers on vocals in already a Hymn. Be well.
B005TMSN4E|4.0|I wanted this so I could attach other lenses and it works well as advertised.<br />I am satisfied,<br />Only problem is storage and setting it up.<br />But I expected that when I ordered it.
B001D08SK0|1.0|The vinyl was supposed to be new but there's a deep scratched on side A about 1 inch. I hear a loud pop between songs 2 & 3.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|So far this seems like a very enjoyable game. I only downloaded it a little bit ago, so I'm sure it will get harder as I advance.
B004WMKSH2|2.0|I wasn't a fan of this movie. Too disjointed. It was, honestly, difficult to follow and at some point I lost interest in the characters and left to wash the dinner dishes.
B00CLT31D6|4.0|It is a bit redundant;  but great life program for most people to follow.  Reminds me of the life my husband and I live,  tho' we've yet to reach the millionaire bit ,  buy think we will!
B0017SWSCW|4.0|so far all books by 'jeffery archer' have been worth it!  easy to read on my 'kindle app'/ipad.  would recommend to a friend.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Just love my new Kindle fire and its features. I'm sure to love it more as I find new apps .
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|you really need to put the real game on and it really didny help muvh and it needs to be free
B00AKKS278|5.0|To achieve 'greatness', we have to encounter challenges, tackle them with enthusiasm, and keep a good attitude.  One also has to make changes to our already mediocre way of living and not be in denial of these necessary changes.<br />Hal has my attention and I think he can be the motivation, and energy, kind of like our cheer leader as we reach to be the best we can be.<br />I recommend anyone (I'm almost 58) to read his very enlightening and simple to follow challenges to reach our full potential.<br />RM<br />Magnolia, Texas
B008P1EWIM|2.0|Really disappointed with this app.  Very basic and not well designed.  It's only 1.99, but IMO not worth it.<br />I can get about as much info by looking out the window.
B00005JO20|5.0|firt time i've bought a licensed DVD movie im my life. i'm very glad, satisfied, i think it's right choice, i 'll never buy unlicensed dollar dvd movie disc.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|David Tennant has to be my favorite doctor.  This series has me hooked.  I found myself laughing out loud as well as gasping.  So good!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Good read.  Full of twist and turns in the story.  Always enjoy Reacher and know I can expect a good book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love this game if you play you Will like it. you will get to ride in tanks and other cars.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|clearly one of the best books i have ever read, I read this book about 20 plus years ago. It was just as exciting the second time around... The suspense builds up from page one to an incredible ending.  it provides a glimpse into the last days of the war. Highly recommend it to all
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Keeps me very entertained and great story line, could not wait to read more. Recommended and don't pass off opportunity to enjoy.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This is definitely the greatest movie out there, I recommend everyone to see it!!!!!!!!!!! One of those movies you could see more than once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />:D :D :) :)
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I love the Nalini Singh Psy/Changeling books and without giving too much away it was very interesting to finally get Kaleeb's story and see why he acts the way he acts. I like series that keep including all of the characters from previous books.
B00514HDNW|4.0|This book was written in the 50's, and the story takes place in the 70's, which gives an interesting perspective of life back in the mid 20th century, and their view of a future 30 years later.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I was so thankful that I chose this book to read.  Sadly I read it after his death and not before because Chris Kyle would definitely have been someone I would have liked to meet.  What I valued most about this book is his honesty.  I don't know what it's like to serve my country through military, and this book opened my eyes to the sacrifice of our military and their families.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Overall, I love Gaiman. I mean, he's a really cool guy. But I don't like all his books the same - some are better than others.<br />This, you would be glad to here, is in my opinion one of his best. A scary, beautiful fairy tail, that would stay with you long after you've read it. Oh, and there's cats, too.<br />Read it. You know you want to.
B00C7O8TSM|1.0|The Beach Boys are awesome, and the 50th reunion shows were magical!  This recording fails to capture that magic because the so called producer Joe Thomas completely screwed up the mixing of these live recordings!  Some of it is almost unlistenable.  This is not what The Beach Boys sounded like during the tour!  Joe Thomas screwed up the mixing BIG TIME!
B006PFC2S2|5.0|This movie takes me away to another world and I love that. To be honest, I do fast forward through a couple of the songs but<br />I just love the dancing.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|There really isn't too much to say about this set.  It's PERFECT and pure GENIUS!  Everybody needs to own this set!  Do youself a favor and buy this!!!!
B005544V6A|5.0|Although I am late to the game with this series, I am very happy I decided to start watching. I'm hooked!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This was just what I was looking for for my monitor.  I did not want to take up my desk's real estate with the footprint of my large monitor, and also did not want a monitor positioned on the wall.  This arm solved those issues - it is easy to install and adjust - and does not look so industrial that it makes me wince.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is a great read.  It held my interest all the way.  I will continue to read the series.  I already have the second book.  I am recommending this book to everyone.
0375869026|5.0|This is not a children's ONLY book.  The story transcends that.  You may think you have read/heard this story before, but it is a journey worth taking again.  I recommend you read this with - or to - your children/partner/parents/friends/grandparents.  For those people far from you, send it as a gift for the spirit.
B00CXQL828|5.0|To be honest when I heard about this &#34;super band&#34; I was skeptic..I never liked this kind of ideas but nonethelessI am a huge fane of richie so I had to check this out..After the intro with &#34;elevate&#34; I was stunned..it looked like hard rock but with the great soulfull voice of richie. and all the songs have the same feeling, great power and musicality. The duo richie-billy was already tested during the Mr.Big years and it doesn't disappoint..MIke portnoy is...well is mike portnoy!..but the dream theater fans will be disappointed. there are no odd time songs no super breaks..it's basically straight 4/4 rock n roll, played of course with great class.Great cd above my expectation..really looking forward to see them live.reccomended for Richie's fans (plenty of great guitar playing and his amazing voice)and in general for those who appreciate good music.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love the music on this album however some of the lyrics are a bit rough.  I try to not listen to the<br />words just the tune and dance away in my car.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Good music I can relate to Kid Rock.<br />This is American originality anybody can understand it.<br />Keep on Rocking Kid!
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|he is cute, but doesnt do much. its good for five minutes of entertainment at a time. not worth spending money on the app though.
B00APJLY0Q|3.0|I shouldn't have bought it honestly. Just rent it and watch it like once or twice and you should be good. Unless it really strikes your fancy, this is a very simple (but endearing) story that doesn't really do well with multiple viewings.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show.  I do not love the rating process.  I wish I could rate without leaving a comment...
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|My Grandkids love this movie. And have been watching it since it arrived.  It's nice to know that Hollywood.  Can still produce movies.  That appeal to all ages. Yes and even Grandpa ?  Enjoys it too.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|Did not realize it was a RENTAL...that was not made clear, so I just got ripped off...extremely with GoHastings. BAD
B009WUBERW|5.0|how did Sylvester Stalon convinced all this superstars to act in this movie. this is one of Greatest movies I'll ever see.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Brilliant:  writing, acting, directing, everything.  An outstanding series.  I'm usually not so &#34;taken&#34; with these series, but this is a notable exception.  Looking forward to season 4.
B004I744AS|5.0|Something nice to look at every day great way to use your brain. I look forward to it every day
B009MYARIK|5.0|This was a sweet drama and I am so glad Fliss is not my sister! Totally enjoyed this book. Recommend reading this book
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Graphics are excellent. Great RPG with options to play solo or multi. I started playing and couldn't put it down. Movement can be a little tricky but not too hard to master.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Haven't played checkers like forever and this just does the job without having to take out the box!! Used to play with my grandpa who would always find a way to beat me no matter how much I tried to outsmart him!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I can play for hours. But they should have a daily score board. Out of your Facebook friends who ever has the highest score of the day should get coins or something! That would be so fun!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So glad I was able to get this on my Kindle - bigger screen helps with this game!!  Just having a ball playing!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is well designed for gameplay that will last for hours. Kind of like Tempe run in a way.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the Pinterest app for my Kindle. I always have my kindle on me and it is helpful I can pull my projects up and review the supplies I need when shopping at the store!
B004SBULWE|5.0|Prior to the installation of this app. I had little to no battery life. Every time I would leave my house I worried whether my phone or tablet would die on me. Since I have been using advanced task killer I no longer have that worry.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Applause? How about a sranding ovation? Love it! Lady Gaga does it again! She is amazing, not to ever be confused with Madonna!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, great effects, the sound cuts out on a part, not a big deal as no one has a dialog during that section.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Will not work on my ematic because it says that I do not have the latest Amazon app. When I do download the app it tells me that another app is stopping it from working.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|OnthebrinkMuch longer game than I expected.  FUN.  I like this kind of game tho I do get tired of spooky background music but even stranger to play muted.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the book and it was very well written and it was not as graphic as it was depicted.
015204907X|5.0|He just loves it--and I do, too.  It reads well, teaches vocabulary, etc, and is fun.  Everything you want in a kids' book!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love mysteries of all sorts.  And to find out that BBC had updated Sherlock Holmes to the modern times, well... it was an incredible experience to watch Season 1!  Cell phones, texting, and still the amazing genius of Sherlock Holmes!!!  Looking forward to continuing the series!
B001OQCV2E|4.0|There is more action than most end of world flicks.  The acting and story are both good.  In retrospect, I realize they relied on coincidence a good deal but I did not notice it watching the movie.  I recommend this for anyone who is into disaster flicks.
B0081336FO|5.0|Continuing the saga of the modern Sherlock Holmes story.  Season 2 had a totally unexpected ending, so I'm anxiously awaiting the arrival of Season 3!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is a very good action flick with a bit of mystery (who done it).  Bruce is a s good as always.  And he has a good supporting cast which makes it even better.  I'd recommend this for anyone who even like action a little.  To me, for Bruce fans and action fans, this is a must have.
B00DU74U74|5.0|This movie was much better than I thought it would be. If you hated the Twilight series please don't judge this movie by it. This movie was very watchable and the lead actress was engaging and could actually act. i say this because this poor movie gets bashed by Twilight haters simply for being based on a Meyer book. It is well written well acted and far superior to her other movies. It does not suffer from the juvenile plot or poor lead acting that the other series suffers from. Will it be an epic series NO it is too mature for teenyboppers to worship is it worth watching YES.
038541627X|5.0|This is a collection of his short stories about science fiction other then robots.  It and volume 2 have a majority of these short stories.  Some are excellent while others are only good.  The books are well worth the price.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|The characters in this movie reminded me of the monster high series they were unique and cute. My kids really liked the movie.
0385349947|5.0|I have not finished all of it, but I am enjoying this book very much.  Reading about so many things that I have felt for years in my own career.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Cute and fun. It can get addicting. I like the options of choosing your own colors for gloves and shorts.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|i just LOVED this show.<br />season 1 is laying out the characters - the one episodes stories were exciting & surprising
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|still out there  at 77 and can still play a mean guitar. one of the last great bluesmen, a national treasure
B004UID2LC|1.0|I downloaded it on my kindle fire.... it doesn't play any videos. Very disappointed and I deleted it off my kindle.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|My family loves this movie so I purchased it in Blu-ray. The picture quality is fantastic and the details I have<br />never seen before in this movie makes it come alive that much more.
