B005K17RU0|5.0|Great all around weather app. Love how it integrates with the updates screen as well. I definitely recommend it as the go to app.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|A lot of fun and easy to remember, the quest mode is great. I can easily get addicted to this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this app because there are so many different games. It's lots of fun and good for all ages.
B005KELS6Q|5.0|This sleeve case is really nice.  The color is a bit brighter than shown on here, and is more of a pink (I thought it looked kind of like a pink/coral on here).  I love the grippy material it is made of, and didn't realize what a difference a little grip would make.    The case itself is put together really nicely.  The stitching is tight and clean, and the zipper moves smoothly.  I was also impressed that the seams on the inside of the case where the fabric sticks out a bit are really small and clean.    I love this case and would get it again, just know that the pink color is a little more pink and a little brighter in person.
B00664AM5C|2.0|If sex sells, the only thing that sells more is impending disaster. Global epidemics are certainly not new in movies, but this is Soderbergh's take on it, and if that's not enough, the ensemble cast assembled in Contagion is the Hollywood equivalent to the Miami Heat and Philadelphia Eagles stacking their respective rosters. If you're into global panic, virus dissemination, or just simply looking for justification for your purchase of a 64oz twin pack of Purell from Costco, then this movie is worth checking out. For everyone else, Contagion is a mosaic of somewhat compelling stories but none of which are fully realized.  The film follows a myriad of individuals who are husbands, doctors, researchers, Internet bloggers, and government officials spanning continents around the world dealing with a deadly transmitted virus that kills those who contract it within days. Through different perspectives and story arcs, the film spans nearly half a year as the origins of the virus are discovered and the subsequent scramble to produce an antidote.  Contagion is not a bad film, it is quite compelling and, compared to other films about global peril, believable. The cast includes a number of academy award winners and nominees including Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Marion Cotillard. The problem is, none of these characters are offered enough screen time to fully flesh out their unique story. It is a bold and ambitious undertaking, as each story line is vastly distinct from one another but by the time you finish whispering \\"I didn't know he/she was in this movie!\\" to your neighbor, the perspective changes and that person disappears. The pacing is necessarily brisk, and the story telling is potent, but because of the constant roulette of scenarios, there is a certain detachment from the story. We hop from one continent to another, spanning the United States, China, and Switzerland, but not once do you feel like the setting is anything more than a backdrop. They all becomea blur and out of focus reminiscent of a view from a moving carousel.   The performances range from adequate to great, though you're never really sure which since most characters bounce from one scene onto another then suddenly into oblivion before their role ever takes off. By the time things wrap up, so many questions remain that you forget to ask because you simply can't keep track of all the characters. The film would have benefited from trimming down all the branches and focusing on a select few. Some notable examples are the husband who is immune, an Internet blogger uncovering or creating a conspiracy, and a researcher desperate for a cure.   Soderbergh voraciously pieces together a story that is larger than the collective whole. The film becomes a haunting study about the desperation of a population in the face of forthcoming doom. While the rotating perspectives helps to keep you engaged throughout the film, it also serves to strip away any tension and attachment you might otherwise have for any of the characters. It is a shame because a few of the intertwining stories could have been a film unto itself. Instead, you are left with a serviceable thriller and a newfound aversion to shaking hands.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|downloaded this app after getting the kindle fire for Christmas. read from it almost every day. love the various translations. best download I chose to run.
B003YYKPMM|5.0|A wonderful, funny, odd, and unique film.<br /><br />Strong acting all around (Jack Palance is amazing). Inventive use of distorted colors and changing camera speeds. A few moments get a bit precious, but generally one of the best uses I've seen of a slightly surreal style to tell a very touching, human story - an overweight, depressed Bavarian housewife is left stranded in the southwest desert by her husband, and slowly finds herself, and a home among the odd characters who live and work at the Bagdad Cafe.<br /><br />This is a case where brave film-making enhances rather than distracts from emotional involvement. The basic theme (we're all weird, and we all need somewhere to fit in) is nothing new, but the approach here makes it delightful and fresh.<br /><br />The original 15 minute longer `director's cut' available on European DVDs does add some nice details, moments and filling out of characters. The film works fine in its shorter US version, and the Italian DVD of the director's cut I got here was frustrating in that it had a a weaker visual transfer than the US DVD, and there were Italian subtitles you couldn't turn off, but I was glad to see it, and overall it's an even stronger film with the original material added back in.<br /><br />The best version I've found is the Japanese blu-ray, which also uses the longer cut, has no forced sub-titles, and has the best image quality of any disc I've seen of the film (although it's still far from 'reference quality').  That's available on Amazon.jp, and the price ranges from ridiculous to 'not bad'.
B005K2XM94|4.0|Case is snug but not too snug, is functional, looks good. Taking Kindle Fire in and out of case does remove some of the fingerprints (an added bonus), but I'll still need to clean the screen at some point. I am quite pleased with this purchase.
B006O5Y0SS|4.0|I don't know that I can say I loved this movie but I walked out of the theatre feeling great. It was a beautifully filmed piece set amongst the backdrops of Paris. The basic premise of this movie is a writer, who is struggling to finish a novel, goes to Paris with his girlfriend and her parents. One night while walking through the streets of Paris after hours he discovers a rift in time that takes him back to the 20's where he meets all of the famous writer who frequent high school reading lists these days. He seeks his inspiration among them and find himself falling in love with a young muse he meets (Marion Cotillard, who is stunning!). This was a beautiful film to watch that left me as a viewer feeling happy (and a little bit more excited for an impending trip to France!). The music was beautifully picked, costumes were perfect, the characters were wonderful. I guess I did love it after all!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I downloaded this app yesterday and used it for the first time this morning.  I was reading Mt 21 and found 2 verses with significant omissions in them!  They were verses 25 and 31.<br /><br />I like this app for being able to highlight and add notes.  However, I can't trust it to provide an accurate copy of the version I use and I will be removing it from my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />So far, the Logos bible app is the best I have found.<br /><br />Use this app with caution!<br /><br />One other thing:  I tried to contact the publisher of this app, but they don't make it very easy to contact them.  I had to download windows live essentials and restart my machine - I'm not sure if they got my message, but maybe they will see my review.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love it. Nice for use wherever you go. My son and I use netflix on kindle fire, xbox, and phone. Needs newer movies though.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a Very nice game. A Calming and quiet way to spend time. The music is soft and soothing and the levels are challenging but not impossible
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I bought this just before Christmas and I have to admit, it is well suited for gaming where I am located.  Due to lack of space where I am, having this space saving equipment makes it easy for me take my Xbox 360 or PS3 with me everywhere I go.  I would definitely recommend this for any college student whom doesn't have enough space in their dorm room or for soldiers who are deployed with very little space in their work areas or sleeping quarters.  The price I paid was a little high, but the price might drop a bit if your patient.  I plan on using it when I get home and have to visit relatives as he holds EVERYTHING you need for the Xbox 360 or PS3.  Well worth purchase!  The screen is a little small, but the portability makes up for that!
B00007L4OM|3.0|Jean Reno plays an overly brutal French cop, who at one time was with French Intelligence in Japan.  He fell in love with a Japanese girl, but she broke it off.  He returns to France and becomes a cop.  17 years later he receives word that she has died and left him a box.  He travels to Japan to pay his respects and retrieve the box.  And that is when the plot begins.  I won't give away the surprises, but it's a fun action film.  Only 3 stars because of some bad casting and cartoon characters.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great choice of online Bibles.  Great choices for download.  Very quick to fix any bugs in the software.  Note are also great.
B0042ESTQW|5.0|I hate for my electronics to get dinged up and bought this before I ever took my Edge 800 on the road.<br /><br />It may interfere with the Temperature a little - I can't say for sure, but the protection is worth a little deviation in the temperature reading.  It works very well!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is addicting.  You want to play more and more to earn more money and open more games. I played for hours.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|great price - my son was very excited to get this for christmas.... good price and came in a timely manner....thanks again
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I've had my BK2 for a couple weeks now and am very impressed with it. The quality is excellent and it's very robust and well designed. If you want a general purpose HEAVY-DUTY bush knife for any nearly task this is an outstanding choice. The grip is just the right size and contour. I've opted to stick with the stock grip scales it comes with for now. The sheath is very sturdy and well designed also, keeping the knife locked into place very positively. The heavy nylon belt loop is absurdly over-sized so I remedied this by taking it to a leather shop and having him stitch it so it rides high on my hip and fits my 1.5\\" pants belt just right, no more flopping around and hanging too low, hugs close to my side and feels very secure this way - a $5 fix.
B00168OIP8|5.0|The best thing about this film is that all of the leads were in their prime and the casting was perfect.  The story is original and keeps you entertained to the last scene.  Tom nails his role.  This is a DVD you will watch at least once every 6 months.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Andrea Bocelli is our favorite musician, whether singing opera or popular music. This is a wonderful program, with just the right mix of different styles and personalities. I gave it to my husband for Christmas since PBS is not going to play the show all year! It will be a welcome treat at Christmas time for years to come!
B004O3YGMC|3.0|Also, don't presume to tell me how many stars to give it.   (Twice I've gotten a popup from this app asking me to review it and give it five stars. )  It mostly works, some issues:   Wouldn't work for me at all at first because I tried to use a real password; you need to use letters/numbers only.   Mouseclicks only work intermittantly - typically have to send several times   Requires a gmail username/password if you want to control your PC from outside your home LAN.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Awesome, riviting story - best series I have watched in a long time - have seen all the available seasons and can't wait for the 4th to be released.
B005DI65L2|1.0|somewhere i read that a dog sniffing on a walk is comparable to us reading a newspaper...he's just finding out what has gone on in the neighborhood...the author seems to have taken this idea and explained it in 297 pages...don't know how this could have been on a best sellers list
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Tiene muy buenas caracteristicas y el sonido es muy bueno aun sin instalar el efecto de sonido  lo RECOMIENDO PARA AFICIONADOS Y PROFECIONALES
B004I2K4DY|5.0|We watched it over the holiday. It was a good entertainment. At the very end of the show, there was a person taking picture and stood up and right in the front of the camera during the taping, other than that it was good.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Whoever says that Christine is not King's best work, might be right.  I would not know as I have tried to see a few of his other movies that were from his books, but was so freaked out, I never saw but a few minutes of them.  Once I saw how bloody Carrie was, I figured this genre was not for me.  But, Christine is not meant to be another Gone with the wind, or some other grand movie.  It's just about a teen boy's first car, his first love, bucking his parent's values, all the while being the class nerd.<br />If you were expecting another King epic story, you would probably be disappointed with Christine.  However, it has become a cult-classic, is re-run on cable TV all of the time, and has become one of my favorite movies.  Now, that is staying-power.  So, if you are a die-hard Steven King fanatic, yes, this movie may not ring your bell (or in this case, honk your horn).<br />But, it is a cool movie with cool music and cool scenes:  a run-down old classic car that transforms itself while its new owner also becomes transformed.  In today's world of bullies in the classroom, there is a lesson or two for them in here, also.  And, of course, good-old teenage rebellion is a theme that I never tire of.
0452273331|5.0|I received the book quickly and in perfect condition. I am almost done reading The Fountainhead and I am very happy with this book. I can't wait to read another book written by Ayn Rand.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Virtually makes my android phone and tablet fully functional PCs. Easy to install and easy to use. I also use it as a remote for the media pc hooked up to my TV. I highly recommend it!!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this Verso Artist Series cover and have gotten lots of compliments on it.  I was concerned about the elastic straps at first, but they hold my Kindle Fire firmly in place.
B003L77G06|5.0|Bought this series secondhand...excellent condition, like brand new. Very pleased with my purchase! I will definitely buy more in the future!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I read this book with my book club a few months back and found it gripping! Kept me going all the way through to the last page. Love reading books on my Kindle....
B004IE0G58|5.0|I purchased the above CD/Video for my son.  He has enjoyed it since he received it Christmas Day.  He was thrilled with the \\"gift\\" and he is quite happy with the CD/Video.  I was very happy with the ease of ordering this item from Amazon.com and for the speed in shipping.  All around, we are happy consumers.  Thank you!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A lot of fun, easy to challenging games. some of them are a bit difficult to play until you figure out some of the finer mechanics of the touch screen interaction, but most are fine. good for completionist.
B000XGDO04|1.0|I purchased 21 first and loved every song immediately. I had read that Adele's first album, 19, had gone platinum 4 times over, so I bought it expecting it to grab me the same way that 21 did.  I was very disappointed. I doubt I will ever listen to it again :(
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it and use it almost every day.  This app was useful in helping me to achieve a daily reading plan.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun tot all to play and I would recommend to anyone any age!! easy to get points and fun to play ever single game
1849163863|3.0|The above reviewer has described the premise of this book very well, so I won't repeat that and will concentrate on my opinion of it.  The good bits first.  The Black House is a highly atmospheric book, painting a detailed and fascinating picture of the life and traditions of an insular island people.  The murder mystery moves along at a good pace, with enough twists and turns to keep the reader intrigued.  I didn't mind the switches in time, finding that they added to the suspense as well as building up a more intricate picture of the characters lives.    What really spoiled this book for me was the climax.  Far from finding it unexpected and dramatic as the above reviewer did, I found it a major letdown.  (*POSSIBLE SPOILER*).  I won't give away any details of the plot, but will say that the resolution was based around a case of repressed memory, a significant one spanning several years.  Now I'm sure this kind of thing may happen, but not nearly so often as it's portrayed in fiction, and to me it always seems something of a cheat.  My immediate reaction was \\"Oh not this again\\", followed by \\"how likely is that - NOT\\".  After this the rest of the book felt flat to me and I rushed to the end as quickly as possible.    Another thing that made me roll my eyes was the stereotyped portrayal of the animal rights activist - skinny, pale, ineffectual, effeminate and too stupid to realise his hypocrisy in eating fish but not meat.  Please.  Whatever May's views on hunting, setting up it's opponents as straw men does nothing to enhance his credibility.   To me The Black House was worth a read for the journey rather than the destination.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool game lol I like it fun and I play it all night j k l n h g g f g h tvvh g y y gvy yvy y y y h g g g. y g c
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Couldn't find a copy of this CD anywhere in town, so ordered it from Amazon for my hubby for Christmas. Arrived quickly even with all of the holiday traffic. Can't get enough of The Band Perry in this house!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I don't understand why this movie lost the best movie Oscar to The King's Speech! Beside that the blu- ray image quality os astonishing!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is very fun and family friendly. There are many fun games like darts and soccer so this makes this app for all ages. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys great games. Two thumbs up :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have Evo Slide and it is very stable.  It remembers where I stopped and can add bookmarks.  I really like the audio capability.
0140277447|5.0|FIrst, I have to say I got interested in the subject after seeing a movie made about the Nazi who harbored so many innocent Chinese in what was a \\"safe zone.\\"  I use parenthesis because Japanese soldiers disregarded the safe zone to rape and kill more innocent children and women so it was hardly safe, but without almost no Chinese people would have survived.  Second, it is alarming that the Japanese continue to deny what took place.  It is a fascinating culture.  I've never gotten the sense, even when visiting the country, that they hate people from the United States for what took place during WWII.  To the contrary I felt welcomed, even when taking a tour that happened to stop at a lot of buildings and bridges that had to be rebuilt because of bombings from WWII.  I only mention it because I don't think it is some sense of right and wrong that prohibits them from acknowledging what took place.  Third, it is amazing and extremely disconcerting what people will do to other people when left unchecked.  Never having been to war I can't imagine raping and killing innocent people, but it is obvious from what is currently going on in the world and what transpired in WWII a pretty high percentage of men don't have a problem committing atrocities.  Fourth, hey, if we want to move forward as a species we've really got to move past the notion of nations and move to a global community.  Until then we have to remain vigilant to what has transpired in our past.
1435287959|1.0|I can't believe people gave this 3 1/2 stars.  The author is a total fraud.  He wrote the book passing it off as a true story and lied to Oprah telling her it was true.  When the book started selling, people who knew him were quick to point out that he was a total fraud.
0307891402|5.0|I've been wanting this ever since it came out and am so happy that I was able to get it for the sale price. It's amazing. And I usually don't like buying game guides.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I saw his advertisement for this new Cd before Christmas and I had to have it!  It was all I imagined and more, I listened to this cd over and over. Enjoyed the old classic tunes with the Buble twist.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Finally, someone in Hollywood puts out something good.  This movie was amazing.  It was fresh, it was funny, there were no boring moments.  Going into it I thought 2 hours would take forever to arrive, but this movie was so fast paced it felt like it was done way too soon.  Steve Carell was amazing.  He plays the typical WASP suburbanite perfectly.  He was that guy that most men in America have turned into.  They get up, go to work, wear clothes that suck, don't ever have sex with their wife b/c they bore her, etc,.  He ends up moving out after his wife asks for a divorce, and hits the bar scene pretty hard to drink away his woes.  There, he runs into Ryan Gosling who plays a \\"Super Stud\\" bedding women left and right, who then takes Steve's character under his wing.  There are a lot of twists and turns in this movie accompanied with a lot of unexpected funny moments.<br /><br />This is well worth the 2 hours it took to watch.  It's a great date night movie, and a great reminder to men as to what happens when we give up on ourselves.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is an amazing remote app. Very smooth with almost non-existent latency. I was using PhoneMyPC up until recently, but this outperforms it by a mile.
B005CAATXG|5.0|This album is one of my favorites. If you like people like Paramore, Flyleaf, Skillet, and things like that, you'll probably love it as well. It's like a punk heavy rock mixed with awesome. They have great lyrics and really cool music. If you're debating buying this, look up the songs Get Well and Pieces, which are my personal favorites. Great album and I highly recommend this if you like rock or pop music.
0802473156|5.0|Not only did I receive it in excellent condition, but it was also and excellent read!  Very informative and applicable to every life.
0688091717|4.0|Lovely children's book with beautiful illustrations.  Illustrations look contemporary although this is a classic.  This story has a sweet message.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this would be a good game for young and old alike, some of the games make you think and some are easy. over all this is a good game.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I have daughters--which means I get to watch lots and lots of really sappy animal movies. :)<br /><br />When I first heard about Hachi, I was afraid it would be just another formulaic feel-good tale about a pup. Then I read the cover--and then I remembered. It wasn't the first time I had read this story. I was stationed in Japan during my days in the military and I saw the statue of the real Hachiko at Shibuya Station in Tokyo then.<br /><br />Overall, although the story loses something in its translation from 1920s Japan to 1990s America, the movie is really good, a tale of loyalty that will bring a lump to your throat.<br /><br />And it also brings to the table some unique cinematography that I've never seen in any other animal movies. Everytime you look at a scene through Hachi's eyes, the camera goes to black and white. Dogs are, after all, color-blind. Very humorous, and very effective.
B0024NSG4S|5.0|I got this as a gift for my kids. They love it and I think it is truly a cute move that can be watched over and over.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this app on my new Kindle Fire. I enjoy it very much and find myself playing it daily. I would recommend it if you like playing solitaire.
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|\\"You put this kid behind the wheel there's nothing he can't do.\\"  Stunt driver (Gosling) moonlights as a getaway driver for criminal heists.  He only drives, doesn't carry a gun and has a specific time frame he operates in.  When his neighbors husband gets released from jail he finds him beat up and bloody with his son.  Realizing that there is only one way to help him he decides to drive for him, until something goes wrong.  I went in expecting \\"Transporter\\" with Ryan Gosling.  I was wrong.  While I did like that movie this one was much better.  This movie actually had more of a plot and more tension I thought.  While \\"Transporter\\" was more action based this one was more story and character based.  There were large chunks without dialog but the performances were so good that you knew what they were \\"saying\\".  There are some strong graphic violence scenes in this but I have to say this was much different then I expected.  Much better also.  Overall, very much worth watching and much better then I expected. I give it a B+.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun but to move on to a new game required too many points though. some of the games are really difficult
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use and comprehensive. Definately recommend this to anyone who needs to know what the weather is going to be for the current day, and up to ten days in the future.
B004HO6I4M|3.0|Overall this is a cute movie, especially for families or those into animation.<br />It has a variety of unique characters (some too funny for their own good) and fun songs to sing along with.<br />The story follows a vert rare tropical bird on a trip down to South America to meet and hopefully mate with the last female of his kind.  Of course, the female has other plans, like an escape out of her caged confinement and the adventure begins...<br />My issue was with the story, which was boring and slow at times, and lacked greatness. So I have to look to the writers. The story lacked a strong enough foundation, the drama, the hurdles the main character must go through in order to save the day. Those steps, create the tension, and it's that tension that hooks us to the main characters plight (take \\"Gladiator\\"). This movie just didn't pack a punch, and it could have.<br />A story doesn't have to be down played or made \\"simple\\" just because it is an animated movie. It can be a great story, and still be a family movie with a punch.<br />It is a light movie, if you're not picky about story.<br />I'm not sure I would add this movie to my collection.
B0062NAX1U|3.0|This movie is basically a tutorial on how to be a good christian father.<br /><br />Lots of preaching and giving you advise on what is wrong , what is right. Besides that there are few impressive scences that show the battle between cops and drug dealers.<br /><br />Overal a good movie, I would have given it 5 stars if there were less boring preaching and advising scenes and more of action that a police job requires.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great app and the only reason I gave it four stars is because some of the instructions are not very clear
B0054JZC6E|5.0|one of the best games on my kindle fire it says three is 101 but there is actually 117 the bessssttttt
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|All DVI's are not the same.  Make sure your monitor supports the newer DVD-D standard for this to work.  DVI-D has been around a few years.  The older spec is DVI-I.  For more info on DVI: [...]  However if you Mac has a minidisplay port and your monitor supports displayport, then that is even a better and cleaner solution.  See my other review.
B004G600A4|3.0|Overall a very cute and fun animated for the whole family!<br />They get above average marks for animation, obviously, and some of the character's were very uniquely amusing (the whole passive aggressiveness of the evil witch/aka Mom).<br />Definately a fun movie too, filled with a lot of humor, and it had some very emotionally dramatic scenes towards the end (but everything turned out well).<br />My issue with the movie, relates back to story structure and writing. The story just didn't punch me in the gut enough. I want a story to captivate me, to have a strong enough story, that I'm glued to the TV. Not the case with this movie. However, I did think it was clever how they updated the story of Repunzel (spelling?). High marks for that.<br />My smaller second issue was the musical songs. Cute, yes. But not great. I'm not a fan of musicals anyway, I'll admit. Though I did love Grease, Mary Poppins, Sound of Music.<br />Was it a good movie? Yes.<br />Was it a cute movie? Yes.<br />It is a good movie for families? Yes.<br />Was it fun? Yes.<br />Was it funny? Yes.<br />Did it move me at times? Yes.<br />Was it a great movie? No.<br />Bummer. I'm on the fence if I would buy this for my library. I probably would, just for the animation and pleasantness. Great movie to just zone out with if you're laid up in bed or just want to vege out.
B006IGZWB2|2.0|The Help(released  Aug./11)is a thoroughly disappointing entry in a long line of film entries to do with race relations in the south;this particular foray finding us in the early 60s.<br />One Skeeter Phelan(Emma Stone) is an aspiring writer who gains a toehold into her profession by writing an advice column for the Jackson,Miss.newspaper.Upon returning home she finds the black maid that raised her has been dismissed.She is upset and gets a brainwave to write a book from the titled \\"helps\\" perspective.We are introduced to various maids,their families and their hardships in relation to their working circumstances,along with their social ones.We are also given almost a verbatim accounting of the then laws of the State of Mississippi governing Blacks and their interactions with Whites and visa versa.Many people get hurt along the way,both white and black,both mentally and physically.Skeeter,of course in the end,gets Stein books in NYC to finally publish her \\"heartrending\\"(my quotes)story.Yahoo.<br />From the moment a movie begins I want to feel that 1)it is actually going somewhere,which will and most importantly, 2)get me involved,somewhere along the line,in what I am seeing on the screen.Neither of these things occurred to any degree whatsoever during this ponderous 146 minute borefest supremo.When the movie tried to get interesting at various points I was so put off with what had led up to that point,that I could have cared less.And to make matters worse the plot and dialogue were cliched to the nth degree.Sorry folks we have been there and done this SO many times that a film of this topic,in this day and age,absolutely HAS to be top drawer from the start or it is doomed to failure,because it has found far superior platforms in the past either at the movies or on television.<br />The best thing I can say about this film is it was really good to see Cicely Tyson,Sissy Spacek and Mary Steenburgen back on the screen.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r and the picture is clean and crisp.Extras include commentary and deleted scenes.<br />In conclusion give this bomb a wide pass.If you want something more stimulating and decent about race relations and prejudice in the south,this is NOT the place to look.is clean and crisp.Extras include commentary and deleted scenes.

B003K07DUC|2.0|Saw it and lived it. Good action sequences. Fast paced. Decent story line but the movie is propaganda looking to make a political statement and as we see now, it turned out better than the left would have us believe. Iraq is ruling itself and we don't own their oil fields.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|epic, legit, and more epic. great game. i love it. really passes the time. a good way to pass the time
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Great story line Very good video effects you will enjoy this movie with a twist on the normal cowboy story
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really loved playing this game and I personally think its better than angry birds. Hope you guys comes up with another game like this

0553805371|5.0|Superb book - perhaps the best general book on science I have ever read - and I've read quite a few.  With a strong science background, it was a very fast and surprisingly light read, given the topic.  A stark contrast from Brief History of Time, which was much harder.  The explanations are clear and concise, using wonderful analogies to help the reader understand very complex concepts.  A favorite example of mine is how our brains interpret reality rather than objectively reporting what is.  If we put glasses on that make the world up side down, our brains will turn it right-side up before too long. Astonishingly, when we take the glasses off, our brains will see the world up-side down  even though it is really right-side up. This is a powerful way to introduce the idea of model-dependent realism. Reality can only be tested to the extent that it does or does not conform to a given model.  A variant of this idea has been expressed by others as: there is no \\"out there\\" out there.  The authors gave the best explanation I have read of quantum physics and the two slit experiment. I have read dozens of articles or passages on this, and they all pale in comparison. I had never quite understood Fyneman's alternative histories ideas, nor his famous diagrams that he painted on his van. It was also the best explanation of particle physics and how the different theories are trying to be tied together.  I was already familiar with most of the concepts in the book, so the value for me was not so much in learning new ideas as in learning  new ways to think about and explain the ideas.  Perhaps most importantly, it put it all together into one place painting a coherent big picture view of modern physics.   The writing style is very refreshing,  sprinkled with dry humor and plenty of cultural background and history how many important ideas evolved. Instead of bashing us over the head with how amazed we should be with each idea (like many writers do), the style is often to understate.  Decades of scientific research trying to solve an equation might be mentioned in passing as \\"there were great difficulties with this approach\\".  The many examples and humor always help to bring the heady ideas down to earth in a fun and helpful way. For example, if earth was in a more elliptical orbit than it is, then in the summer, the oceans would be boiling and frozen in winter -- not very conducive for a good vacation!   The authors also avoid the all-too-frequent religion-bashing that goes on in much science writing. Instead they make comments about how people with religious views will tend to think about a subject or point, and then explain how there is an alternative scientific way that does not require the God hypothesis.  While it is clear the authors are not religious, they also respect the views of others without making fun of them.  I really can't think of any significant changes I would recommend - hence 5 stars.  OK - there is one thing. It was unnecessary and frankly silly to say Philosophy is Dead - but that does not detract in any way from the other N-3 words in the book.
1466401885|1.0|I was in the market for a fast, easy read, and I wish that I'd never purchased this. If you feel the need to subject yourself to this book, please go to the library.   It's not badly written but it's so shallow and pat that I regret buying it.   Save yourself the money.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love the show so the DVD's are great. I can get my Bazinga on any time. Order came in about a week and the price was okay.
B005I6EVUG|3.0|the only thing i wish i would have known is that if i was going to be playing games or watching a movie that i would want a flip cover not a closed encased cover. it is a sturdy cover to keep the kindle safe from harm i got it because it was like the one i had with my regular kindle but the kindle fire is so different and does so many more things you really need a flip top cover for the most use of it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|hands down best Bible app out there! Not to mention its free!! All the reading plans they have are awesome too!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've had no problems with this app and I've found the up-to-date info, the radar, and the extended forcasts very useful and informative
B004JK61K0|5.0|This is the best Email app I have found and I have tried several others. This works great on my Velocity Micro Cruz T301. You cannot go wrong with this as your Email software on your tablet or android device. Far superior to the one offered by the manufacture. You have to have this one for sure.
B004H2N5VS|3.0|After reading the first 2 sections of this book it will refer you to the back of the book where there should be a packet that contains an on-line code so that you can take an online strengths assessment. I didn't know this when purchasing or I would have spent the few extra bucks for \\"new\\" vs. \\"almost new\\".  Just trying to save others the problem.  Other than that the concept, ideas, thoughts, etc. sound interesting.  In fact, I will probably buy it again \\"new\\" and try it a second time.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|****UPDATE*** Husband's buddy who is in the Coast Guard saw this watch and liked it so much that he ordered one for himself the same day******<br /><br />Chose this timepiece for my husband who is a federal law enforcement officer. It is a large heavy watch, has a tactical appearance and goes well with his uniform.<br /><br />Husband consistently receives compliments on the timepiece and his only non positive comment was about the strap, he did not think that it would last long but it was ok for now.<br /><br />It is easy to read at a glance in all conditions and the feedback from other officers was all very positive.<br /><br />Obviously a well made heavy duty quality timepiece and we are very satisfied. Highly recommend!!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I don't write movie reviews, probably because most movies aren't worthy of my time to review.  Courageous was clearly an exception.  What could be better than to be entertained by a movie that reinforces all the values and principles you are taught at church while at the same time keeping you riveted to the story?  That is becoming more and more rare in films.  Not only that the acting was very good and production values top notch, I was entertained.  How can I complain about a story that made me laugh, cry and take stock in who I was as a man.  Clearly there was nothing to complain about and only praise to give.  One of the advantages this movie has over their previous film, Fireproof, is that it speaks to a wider audience, one all men should be able to relate to.  So for me this was a home run, it was a movie that showed men in positive realistic roles attempting to learn/grow as they realize the importance of a father to their families all the while not sugar coating the problems.
B001NPDCFQ|5.0|Wonderful movie!!! Judy Garland, Margaret O'Brien, Tom Drake etc... a fantastic cast.<br /><br />The Digibook looks great and contains beautiful photos and informations about the movie, actors and nice trivias. Also the song lyrics are added. The Set contains a CD sampler with the best songs from the movie.<br /><br />The Picture Quality looks very good but not quite perfect as \\"Gone with the wind\\" was on Blu-Ray.<br />Also the soundtrack sound good. The Disc itself is codefree but contains only english / french + subtitles.<br /><br />On the disc are available very interesting bonus features which are the same like on the 2Disc DVD Special Edition which came out a few years ago (incl. Pilotepisode with Celeste Holm, Tab Hunter).<br /><br />Fazit: Its a must have it!!!<br /><br />P.S: I would sell my old dvd but can't because I got it signed by Margaret O'Brien ;-)

6305014140|5.0|What can I say about this movie that people already don't know. This is an awesome movie. If you like action movies this one definately doesn't lack it. It has a little mystery mixed with sci-fi. I hope you found this little review helpful.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|this game borders on fun and drive you crazy.  sucks I have to play games u don't like to unlock new games glad I got it for free.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Unless you go for the fancy-look protection, this meets my need to protect my Fire. Its plain-looking but actually individualized mine by putting my designs in the outside cover (not artsy - but its mine!). Worth every penny...
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Pretty nice little mixer. I purchased it to be a middleman between my [[ASIN:B000FVUKI6 Gem Sound TR300 DUAL 15\\" DJ SPEAKER 600WTWEETER HORN FULL RANGE]] and my ASUS laptop for DJing. The EQs are nice, they control a good and accurate range of frequencies. I haven't tested any of the mic inputs but the line inputs work and have good sound. The light-up level meter is a nice feature for keeping track of the master level and if you are mixing in darkness.<br /><br />Overall, pretty dang awesome and definitely worth the money!
1468161660|5.0|I'm an avid reader and I wasn't sure if I would like this book because I've never been into poetry much. However, after only one chapter, I was hooked. I read it in a day with almost no breaks. It drew me in and kept me. The characters are very well developed and the storyline and things it deals with are easy to relate to. It made me laugh and it made me cry. Highly recommended book! Hope the author writes more soon!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game, not too easy. challenging. lots of games to play.  easy to get more points. directions easy to understand

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I am getting sick and tired of the priority placed on Blu-ray products. I do not have a Blu-ray player, and as a poor student with no television and only a laptop to watch DVDs, I will not be getting one in the near future. So the fact that the special features on one of my favorite movies are ONLY available on a Blu-ray disc is simply unacceptable. A 2-disc DVD copy of this film does exist, but it only has half of the special features and is not even sold by Amazon anymore, as far as I can tell. This pushing of a technology whose benefit is questionable in the first place and the consequent disenfranchisement of potential customers is profoundly infuriating.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|I was really into the first half of the book. I empathized with the characters, got sucked into the plot, and couldnt put it down. This was a story that prompted many existential questions for me, but subtly and without being threatening. How will I be remembered when I am gone? What sort of void will I leave behind and how will it be filled? (Yikes!) Then I got about halfway through the book and thought that the author had covered the material pretty well and couldn't imagine only being 50% of the way through. After that the story lagged a bit for me, circled back on itself unnecessarily, and then the ending was flat and unsatisfying. I finished it, and I still give it four stars, because I imagine that my \\"unfinished\\" feeling is actually pretty accurate to what a person would feel had they lived through this situation. The sharp pain was soothed to a dull ache by the end and that seemed appropriate. I wasnt looking for a happy ending. Had there been something to bring about justice or vengeance, it would have felt contrived and fanciful instead of believable. But after all the going on and on and meandering through long curving inroads of character developments, I wanted more of a polished finish. Some sort of resolution. I wanted release or relief, or at least a more gratifying sense of acceptance. Still a really good read, and one that I would recommend to a friend.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I had a hard time getting into the season this year, so when I bought this cd for myself it changed everything. My daughter and I would pop it in while drivin to the shopping mall and it instantly put us in the shopping spirit. When the stores would play one of his songs over the loudspeaker my daughter would sing along and say she knew it was Michael buble!!
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Spielberg releasing two movies in the same month? And two supremely crafted movies, at that? Ach, the flaunting of the man! Seriously, though, WAR HORSE and THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN are both epic cinema and should be viewed, maybe several times. Here in the States, you hear the name \\"Tintin\\" and scratch your noggin and maybe venture a guess: \\"Is a heroic dog, no?\\" No. Once upon a time, Georges Prosper Remi - more popularly known in Europe as Herg&eacute;, but barely known here - created THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN, a comic strip beloved throughout the length and breadth of Europe. Spielberg is a big fan of Tintin and years ago was able to garner the rights to shoot a film adaptation. Herg&eacute; passed away in 1983, but odds are - in spite of certain liberties taken (not the least of which is the visual look of Tintin himself) - he would've been proud of what Spielberg wrought. Keep an eye out for a Herg&eacute; cameo during the opening sequence. He's the illustrator drawing a caricature of Tintin.<br /><br />It's no coincidence that an Indiana Jones flavor suffuses the narrative (yes, I played the Indy Jones card). The comic strip often propelled Tintin into many a pulp adventure. There's an old time feel here, redolent of those Saturday serial reels, of wild cliffhangers and derring-dos. Tintin looks like a kid - especially with that upswept tuft of hair - but he is well regarded in the community, is treated like an adult. Everyone knows who he is. Tintin is a daring reporter who doesn't hesitate to go after a story. This time, Tintin senses a mystery behind a ship's model of a 17th century man-o'war, which is coveted by several shady characters. Tintin's suspicions are confirmed when he unearths a cryptic scroll hidden within the ship's mast. What happens next, you can call it investigative journalism or a headlong leap into adventure. In any case, Tintin and his clever dog, Snowy, are soon dodging bullets and up to their necks in exotic locales and embroiled in an epic treasure hunt. Apartments are ransacked. There are frequent eruptions of gunfire. Skulls are occasionally ka-bonked. Perilous chases ensue, and fisticuffs. There be even pirates... and opera singers. In one instance of skulking about - as Tintin is about to \\"borrow\\" a set of keys - he is given a heads up about one particular goonish sleeper in the room: \\"He's a light sleeper, on account of the tragic loss of his eyelids.\\" I really love that line.<br /><br />If you're down with the comic strip, then the plot may be familiar. It's lifted (but tweaked a bit) from three existing Tintin exploits (\\"The Crab with the Golden Claws,\\" \\"The Secret of the Unicorn,\\" and \\"Red Rackham's Treasure\\"). Familiar characters surface as the film progresses. Those hapless law enforcers, Thompson & Thompson, pop in and provide comic relief (they're played by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost). \\"Policework isn't all glamour and guns. There's an awful lot of failing,\\" proclaims Thompson, or was it the other Thompson? Mostly, they're just here for show, relegated to trying to nab a notorious pickpocket. More relevant is Captain Haddock, the hard-drinking sea captain and the last surviving Haddock, ancestor of him what stowed away 400 weight of gold. Haddock's ravaged memory is key to unlocking the riddle of the scroll. But drink has done in the captain's synapses. His memory is shot (or is it?). As Haddock, Andy Sirkis, master of capture performance CG, is quite awesome. Have they started doling out awards yet for best capture performance performance?<br /><br />Parents contemplating taking their young 'uns to this one is advised that there is massive gunplay, with Tintin even busting out a gat on one occasion. Mostly, I think the film adheres to the spirit and tone of the source. Time and place are evocative of the 1940s. Tintin is intrepid and noble and idealistic (and, let's face it, sort of bland; the dog Snowy and Haddock always did provide the color). Spielberg and co-conspirator Peter Jackson got all ambitious with the visuals. The performance capture CG is exquisite. I marveled at the vivid attention to detail. The hardest thing to render in CG is the hair, how it sits on the character's head, how it moves, how it looks. But even this was pulled off convincingly. The animation style is photorealistic, except that there are enough bulbous noses going around that a whimsical touch manages to peep thru. There are many spectacular panoramic scenes to absorb, such as Tintin's plane floundering thru a mammoth storm or the sailing ship ripping thru the sand dunes of the Sahara. Near the end, my jaw dropped several times during that exhilarating chase in the streets and on the rooftops of Morocco. \\"Blistering barnacles!\\" to quote a Haddock. Thanks to ever-advancing CG technology, anything truly is possible. Even Haddock's nose hairs are impeccably rendered.kson got all ambitious with the visuals. The performance capture CG is exquisite.

1439102732|5.0|I am a big fan of Jodi Picoult.  She is the one author that I can buy without even looking at the story before, so when I got a Kindle Fire for Christmas I decided that this book was going to be my first.  I was not disappointed.  I didn't know what the story was about at all prior to purchasing, so as I got more into the story I was so shocked!  The similarity to parts of this character's life and mine were, shall I say again... shocking! This book made me feel like I am a little less crazy for changing my life so drastically as I have done in the past year and that perhaps I am not alone.  If you don't have similar things going on in your life I am not so sure that you will find it as interesting as I did, but this is definitely a good read!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a great set of games for any mood that you are in. you get many choices of games to play enjoy and have fun!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome for passing time:)  love it when I'm on a rode trip and dont want to read I play this game!  :)
B006HL9G10|5.0|this is a wonderful tool for a meditation practice! the timer is sweet using nice sounding singing bowls. it gives it an authentic feel. I love being able to see who is meditating with me from around the world. I am practicing daily now!
0446560065|5.0|Wonderful, witty book. This item came in beautiful condition. This book covers from A-Z of the zany behaviors about cat with a humorous twist. I recommend this book for cat lovers and children looking for a good time. It makes good for family sharing time too.  : D
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is pretty good so far. you get extra points for filling out a review so here I am.  it takes a while to unlock all the games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was really fun and gives you something to do and it has good challenges and you should get this game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game it is a lot of fun but some of the games are really hard but they are fun!
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Listening to Dream theater is like a roller coaster ride. There are always twists and turns but once your off the ride you want to right back on. That's how I feel when I listen to DT's music, especially this album. Being a little heavier than other albums this album has more of a punch. So if your more into the heavy DT tracks this is your CD. BUY IT! Something alot of \\"metal\\" or heavy rock lacks melodic lines and musicality. This is something this album throws at you again and again. But despite your musical preference if you like good music this is your kind of music.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I use this on my Kindle fire and it works great! Very impressed with this app. I use this all the time at work!
0312330537|2.0|This is indeed a page turner: I was doing five at a time whenever the sex or philosophising started.  More generally, the self-styled warrior-poet-healer-entrepreneur who narrates this story is clearly no more than a narcissistic fantasy. Not that I have a problem with loathsome narrators in fiction. But in this case the effect is unintended. The alleged autobiographical parallels run too deep, and irony is nowhere to be found. So peer into the shallows of this book's sorry prose and you see a portrait of a very weak person.  I am giving it one star on account of some individual passages that actually work, and another because the idea of someone laying bear such a meagre soul in the expectation of praise struck me as comical.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so much fun... cant wait to earn more points and unlock all the games. love it!!!!!!!!! really cant wait you have no idea u should try it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this is fun and keeps u entertaining! if you have children this will be a great investment.  it will keep them occupied for hours!
030716327X|5.0|I try to give one of these books to each person I know who is having a baby.  It is a great children's book with tactile pages and simple ideas.
0439023521|5.0|A little hard getting into but once you do, you are totally hooked. Leaves you wanting to hurry up and get the next book.  Best I have read in a long time. Hard to explain all the emotions. This is my first time reviewing any book but felt I had to because not too many books leave me wanting more and more.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I seen this app multiple times just looking through so I thought I would try it out and it is addictive.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its a good time waster. I wish they had unlocked all the games from the start, but at least it gives you something to work to.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|There are a few fun games, but most suffer from clumsy controls and wildly varying difficulties; and the whole experience is peppered with incredibly obnoxious ads.
B0069UP2PI|1.0|I think the director was asleep at the switch. Some of the dialogue was very well done and the acting was very good by all players but the assorted scenes and settings were simply mashed together without a connecting thread. You get your standard riots and panic in the streets scenes, but I imagine most B-movie horror flicks have done that chore much better. To top it off, two of the major stars are killed-off almost immediately, one of them muddles his way through scene after scene without much at all to do and a fourth major star simply disappears (poof!) in the middle after portraying a very forceful and central role! Loose threads abound at the so-called ending. The only real satisfaction I got from my otherwise wasted 90 minutes was seeing Marion Cotillard and perhaps 1 minute or so of the other major stars.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|This DVD was great I loved it. It was very entertaining. An extraordinary experience with this product I hope that every body else likes it as much as I did.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|So far angry birds is not working on ice cream sandwich. Hope this has a fix soon I would love to pay it without it crashing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this app. the games are cute,fun and simple. My boyfriend and I would take turns competing to see who could complete each game first.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|You sometimes forget how good Stephen King actually is at weaving a story together. I would put this up there with The Stand, this is one of his best.
B0055DNH0C|5.0|This is a classic \\"feel good\\" music album. Pitbull has shown on this album that he's got the art and the talent to create good, awesome music. \\"Give Me Everything\\" is my favourite song, but the entire album is equaly good. If you want good beats, lyrics and vocals, this is the album to get. From road trips (which I took a couple of days ago), to house parties, to clubs...this album will be the defenite example of good music made perfect. Get it, don't think about it, just get it. It is that good. I got the digital version from Amazon and couldn't ask for more. The ability to download it to my MP3 player, etc. The online cloud storage and flexibility of Amazon's cloud player make purchases easy and a joy to browse for other music. Perfect.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! It's so addicting, you just keep playing and playing..I lost like three hours to this game.
0439023513|3.0|I must first say that I will recommend this series; but was disappointed in the ending. As I write this review, I am not even sure that I remember the ending. The first two books, kept going and going; better and better. This one just limps along; and wish it had kept pace with the others with fireworks at the end.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it a very good game system. over one hundred games all awesome. I think it is the best game I have ever installed.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like the workouts if you vary them, doing level 1, level 2, then level 3 and repeat.  The intro into the workout is crazy though!  You have to go through the entire thing every time before you select a workout and it's ridiculously long.  I started turning off my whole dvd player at the cooldown so that when I start it back up I can just select another workout.  You should be able to fast forward through the intro.  Really, it's a 20 minute program and otherwise it takes 5 minutes just to set it up.
B003L77GH4|3.0|Bought it as a surprise gift since the person is watching the current season. She said its not as exciting but since I havent seen it, I cant say for sure.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|The film had plenty of action and plot.  The acting was fabulous.  Does go to illustrate how persistency can pay off!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really fun for when you're bored. lots of different levels with different types of games.  love it on the kindle fire :)
B004529NKC|3.0|No one watches these movies because they think they're cinematic genius (at least, I hope not). While I thought the original had a decent plot and relatively well-developed characters, the third installment is more of a dance showcase thinly connected by a cliche plot. But since I really wanted to watch this for the dance elements, I was OK with that.   Solely viewed for the dance, this film is easily a 4-5 star film. As a film (with an actual plot and good characters) it's a one-star film (combining the two is where I got the three stars). I mean, honestly, you've seen this film before. Boy meets girl, falls for girl, girl has 'secret' (which you can guess from the get-go) that is revealed, crushing boy's heart. Girl comes through in the clutch and they lived happily ever after. This is essentially a rom-com with a dance twist.  But what a dance twist! The dancing is wonderful and Luke is very nice to look at (though he doesn't really do all that much dancing, which is a shame).   Rent/buy this because you love dancing or just want a fun, easy to watch film (movies don't have to be serious cinema).
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can stream my SAGE TV  tuner to my Kindle! It is very easy to set up. You should get it too.
0439023521|4.0|Fast-paced, bold, and absolutely breath-taking- move over Harry Potter, here comes the Hunger Games! The story is set to the future; the United States is now divided into several Districts, each at a different level of wealth. Katniss Everdeen lives in District 12, and like all the people there, is trying her hardest to support her family. When the time to choose participants for the Hunger Games, an event where a boy and a girl are chosen from each District to participate in a fight to the death- twenty four in, and only one makes it out. Prim Everdeen, Katniss's sister is chosen for the Hunger Games, and Katniss daringly volunteers to take her place. The rest I will leave for you to find out when you read!    Overall, the plot was very stimulating but still kept simple. Suzanne Collins does a wonderful job narrating the Hunger Games. Even though the main character is a girl, The Hunger Games is a popular book among boys and girls.  My only complaint is that certain parts of the story were confusing to me and I didn't follow what was going on. Then again, it may have just been my reading skills, but I did like this book a lot.    I highly recommend reading The Hunger Games to all preteens and adults. It is also a very political book, by the way. There are 3 books in the Hunger Games trilogy, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay. Hope this review was helpful!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|it was an alright game.. nothing special could have had.better games... but they were good enough games..yup o recommend it
B003L77GG0|5.0|What can I say.  Good conclusion for such a long running show - one of my all time favourites.  Would have liked to see more of Chloe Sullivan as she was the link with the other super heroes and Clark.  Love the later seasons with the Super Heroes.  Little disappointed with the extra's in the box set, was hoping for actors interview, more interesting behind the scenes look after for going so long it would have been nice for the fans after following the show for 10 years.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun app, worth the download.I haven't played that much but it seems that has a wide variety of games
0062082353|5.0|A great book by a true American Warrior! For anyone who wants to read a true harrowing tale of a modern day warrior then this book is for you!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I am finding that this app is fun and the only real problem I found with it is that it needs to add something about how to play each game. Not all are self explanatory.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I saw this cover online and was just looking for a simple cover to protect my new Kindle Fire... just a simple cover. I didn't expect this item to be so beautiful. It is embossed with all the artists favorite cities she's traveled to . Miami, Bangalor, Barcelona ... on and on. The leather is top quality... smells like a new car and soft as a baby's butt.   I am MORE than happy with this purchase and my friends and family are ordering from this line!
B0063IH60K|5.0|have played many solitaire games / this is one of the<br />best!  Good graphics &amp; smooth game play. You can't<br />beat the price either, FREE!!!!  Download this game,<br />you won't regret it.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I am not a prude, but it is nice to see a movie that doesn't use profanity in every sentence in the script.  Granted, it has violence.  Video games have more and although the body count is high, you don't have blood and body parts everywhere.  No, this movie will not answer any profound questions you might have.  But if you want to see a good movie with Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and Bruce Willis and a good supporting cast, I don't think you will be disappointed.  The movie is a pleasant diversion and who doesn't need that?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love the intire thing it is super fun and somehow easy I do really enjoy it completely some people say that it is not fun and retarted.
0062101897|5.0|This is an excellent book and is also a beautiful show piece for the bookshelf.  I would also consider that in years to come this will be invaluable for my grandchildren .

B0061QD7YS|5.0|Disney's 15th animated feature.  The Aspect Ratio for this Release is 1.85:1  This was the first animated feature filmed in CinemaScope. 2.55:1 Aspect Ratio.   Although CinemaScope was becoming a growing interest to movie-goers, not all theaters had the capabilities at the time.   *There exist two versions of this film, the difference being the aspect ratio. In 1955 many cinemas didn't have the equipment to show CinemaScope films, so besides the original anamorphic version (aspect ratio 2,55:1) Disney filmed a spherical version (aspect ratio 1,37:1) where some of the animation was redone to fit the frame. If this is correct, it is a BIG disappointment for BluRay. This may be a Mis-Print but as i said above, BUYER BEWARE if you're looking for the CinemaScope Version.  It's also the widest film the company has ever created.    Go To--[...] and go about 1/2 way down the page and you will see The Original Cinemascope, The Pan and Scan version and Walt Disneys Intended Acadamy Framing of the Spaghetti scene.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|Movies are suppose to be magic, but soundtracks are so much a part of that. The songs chosen for this movie are perfect. They make the movie that much more effective. Amazing soundtrack!
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app, well done. that is all. now I am adding some extra words in this app review to meet the minimum requirement

B002ZG981E|5.0|As we've seen this movie multiple times at the theater I decided it was time to buy it.  Comes with Blu Ray and DVD and there are loads of extras which will takes us ages to watch.  I haven't looked yet but there are probably some Easter Eggs hidden somewhere in the extras.
030788743X|5.0|This is the most fun I have had with a book in a long long time. As a middle-aged geek who grew up with all the icons featured in the narrative, I felt like a kid again, rooting along the Wade as he fought against the Sixers. Fantastic book.

B004ZN9RWK|5.0|This Pink Floyd recording is probably the best of the whole PF collection. Well worth having on CD, as my vinyl album is about worn out!
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Shipped out fast and was exactly how it was described! Very pleased with my order and will order from again when I want future items :)
B005URRCUY|1.0|This is not rock, it is pretty much the Backstreet Boys with their instruments. This is pop music not rock and by next year they will not even be known. By the way they name the album El Camino and but a mini van on the cover; are they just too stupid to know the difference.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I purchased this not knowing entirely what to expect, however it has performed well.  Meaning that it is sharpening my blades, however not quite to the quality of that I wish. I have just emailed the company asking what angle the \\"pull-through\\" sections of the sharpener are set to, because that is a very important specification. Sharpening (or should I say dulling) a 20 degree blade to a 25 degree one can hinder performance. I will try to post again, or edit this post (if possible) when I find the information so buyers can be aware in the future.   Specs I do know (from the makers website):   The diamond tapered rod is a 400 grit  The ceramic pull through is a 600 grit  I don't know the grit of the carbide.  The Good:  Works well enough considering its size, which is also important. To have such a portable, lightweight device to sharpen your blade? Serrations too? Very cool.  In relation to the price, it's hard to beat. To have something that works well, and can sit in your pocket or pack, practically without notice, is great.  The Bad:  I can't seem to get my knife to \\"hair-shaving\\" quality, but then again, maybe that's asking too much.  Another, slightly more serious problem I had, was a piece of steel in the carbide section falling loose. I had to unscrew that section, and super glue the piece of metal in place so it would not rattle or move at all as I sharpened.  Overall, for most uses I would say the sharpener provides a fine enough edge for most anything.
142311339X|5.0|Excellent book, well written and fast paced. My daughter loves the series and wants me to buy her more as soon as possible!
B00008WT5J|5.0|Sure it's slightly flawed with two pedestrian instrumentals, created specifically for the stephen king movie 'maximum overdrive' but there's a lot of great stuff on here: shake you foundations, sink the pink, for those about to rock, hells bells, you shook me all night long,ride on, and the title track is great as well. this reminds me of one of my good friends who's passed on, mario \\"the madge\\", best friend and fellow metal enthusiast. r.i.p madge.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly has been my second go-to RSS reader on the Kindle Fire, but with the September 2012 refresh, it is a thing of beauty. Seriously, it's like someone hit it with the pretty stick. The interface is smooth and seamless. The menu appears out of the left side, a series of tabs of different lengths and colors that make it easy to get to the section you want. I even love the font. Good job, feedly folks!
0385535139|3.0|It is very slow and depressing for most of the book.  But about 23 though it, it starts to  improve.  I enjoyed it overall.

B0036EH3WK|4.0|My undying love for Lost aside, I am really not impressed with all the extra little trinkets in the box set.  I am not that excited over the board game and the ankh and the Black Rock diary excerpt.  It seems aimed at younger viewers (I am 54). I also think the DVD package could have been done better.  I would have paid the same price for something a little more compact and streamlined.  But of course, it's Lost, so it's still great!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I highly enjoyed the film, although I thought there were a few missteps that could have been improved.  Excellent work by Zack Snyder on directing.  The Extended Edition is highly preferred over the theatrical edition and is more entertaining.  It adds a few more details which are necessary to a more enjoyable experience.  The added dance number was really great and helps add a new level and balance to the film.  I'm glad it was added back.  The visual look and feel of the film is incredible.  The story could use some work though, but not too much more.  I thought the story was easy to follow, understand, and interesting.  The thing I love most about the Blu-ray is the MAXIMUM MOVIE MODE.  One of the best ideas ever implemented.  I enjoyed hearing explanations and seeing green-screen work, and behind-the-scenes of almost all of the scenes throughout the film from Zack Snyder, and his cast and crew.  And the option to view the additional concept art and photo galleries while the movie pauses, and then continues once you finish, works perfectly and seamlessly.  Zack Snyder and his team did a great job with visuals,story-telling, and creating a wonderfully wholesome and enjoyable film as he always does with his films, mainly 300 and Watchmen. I love this Blu-ray two-disc version of Sucker Punch and it is a welcome addition to my Blu-ray collection.  4.5/5 stars for the film, 5/5 stars for the 2-disc Blu-ray.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I. really enjoy reading this on my kindle fire, I can bookmarks where iv left off. though I do have to read some of the passages over again only because of the wording. but its still good.
0060254920|5.0|We love this book! I love reading it with my 3-year old son and he loves the Wild Things in the book. This is near the top of his list when we pick books to read everyday, along with The Very Hungry Caterpillar and Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. You can just see the wheels turning in his head when he sees Max go to his room without eating. My three-year old has so many questions when we read this book so it's fun to try to figure it out together.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game and it is free too . The kids love it. I do recomemend this game do get it
B0034G4P9E|5.0|All three leads did an incredible job with their characters. Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy, and Nick Nolte, great job on the performances.  Tom Hardy looks amazing as a bulked-up MMA fighter.  Nick Nolte looks and performs well as a \\"beaten-down in life\\" old man.  Joel Edgerton did a great job too.  Story was good, although it feels like it was missing something, but the way this movie was executed was incredible.  Great job on the cinematography. Just one or two scenes where the cameras were a little too shaky when they should've been steady.  The action and the flow of the movie were just right, the fighting was realistic.  There are a few scenes that are grainy, most-likely due to filming in incredibly low-light, but it was probably intended for the gritty feel of certain scenes. This film was entertaining, well-made from a filmmaking perspective, and I think I should have seen it in theaters. Excellent job to the director Gavin O' Connor for making a superb film.    As for the supplements, the best are the documentary about how the actors trained to become fighters.  It's about a half hour in length and worth watching. There's also a 20-minute interview with Frank Grillo (trainer for Brendan Conlon in the film) and trainer Greg Jackson that is interesting.  Only a single deleted scene not important to the film. A welcome addition to my Blu-ray collection. As for the Rocky comparison, I think Rocky still has the edge on storytelling and film, but this film comes close.
B0058VW36U|5.0|entertaining game that takes a lot of thought. many differrent level packets that hold level with one objective...  feeding your little friend
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great way to fill extra time. not too difficult, but fun and addicting. look forward to unlocking even more games.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I had read the reviews before ordering this case and was surprised by how many people thought it looked cheap and possiby wouldn't work without even putting it on their Kindle Fire! I put mine on right after recieving it and LOVE IT! My kids have dropped it a couple of times while playing games and it has done a fabulous job protecting my Kindle. One reviewer said she didn't like the stand feature but it works great for me. If I were to get a new cover it would still be this one just in a different color for variety!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is a downfall that it has to be connected to wifi but over all great app for an on the go portable bible

1451648537|4.0|A creator like no other who stood at the intersection of art and technology, with a passion for building an enduring company that makes beautiful, simple, and great products. And yet at the same time not a model boss, or an individual - with a rather nasty side to his personality - one would wish to emulate. Overall the Steve Jobs story is instructive, fascinating, incredible, with plenty of lessons about creativity, imagination, innovation, focus, character, leadership, and human values.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of variety,  endless fun, and you can't beat that it is free!  You really can't go.wrong giving this app a try.
B004UBM4TA|5.0|I spent so much time ooing and aweing at how cool the 3D effects were that I really can't even tell you too much about the content of the material. I hardly even listened to the facts of the outer space informational tutorials on the planets/compositions/etc. I can say that I have now watched about 5 3D movies that are similar in content from under sea (former favorite) adventures to arial based movies etc.. I liked this movie mostly for it's 3D visuals. Will have to watch it again to comment on the quality of the content.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a good time waster. It would take me a few tries before actually figuring out some of the games. All of the games are pretty simple though, and if you're ever stuck on an elevator with no Facebook, then this will give you something to do.

B005N0C0I2|5.0|I was a huge Oasis fan from the get-go.  The first time I heard \\"Live Forever\\" back in '94 or '95, I was not only hooked on that particular tune, but I felt an almost absurd level of excitement that Oasis would 'change the world', so to speak, and I could hardly wait to get my hands on the \\"Definitely Maybe\\" CD.  Although I expected it would be great, \\"Definitely Maybe\\" took that a few steps further--it proved to be a monumental album that had a profound affect on me at that tender age.  Oasis sounded like a sheer force of nature, and for all their admitted musical 'thievery', they still managed to sound completely fresh and distinctive with their blend of surging hard rock, psychedelia, and insanely catchy pop-rock hooks.<br /><br />Over the course of their next few albums, along with their slew of fantastic non-album b-sides for which they became somewhat notorious for over time, Oasis explored different variations on their trademark epic sound, by and large to brilliant effect.<br /><br />But more than that, Noel Gallagher continually revealed a penchant for not just purely acoustic driven numbers such as \\"Sad Song\\", \\"It's Better People\\", and \\"Angel Child\\", but also a relatively stripped-down balladic style where the songs had a distinct blend of melancholy and introspection, a style exemplified on songs such as \\"Going Nowhere\\" and \\"One Way Road\\".  Perhaps tellingly, the official versions of all of these aforementioned songs feature Noel himself on lead vocals as opposed to his brother Liam who was always the 'main' lead vocalist for Oasis.<br /><br />For me, 2000's \\"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\\" is the last great Oasis album.  In retrospect, it's sort of transition piece, as original members Paul Arthurs and Paul McGuigan left the group in 1999 and didn't play on the album, but Gem Archer and Andy Bell didn't come on board until after the recording was completed, if I understand correctly.  Nonetheless, terrific Noel songs such as \\"Go Let It Out\\", \\"Gas Panic!\\", and \\"Roll It Over\\", plus Liam's deceptively charming songwriting debut \\"Little James\\", all seemed to indicate that the Oasis tank was far from empty.<br /><br />However, when the whole 'second phase' of Oasis kicked in with 2002's \\"Heathen Chemistry\\", with Gem Archer and Andy Bell now fully integrated band members who even contributing some of the songwriting, it was the first real red flag that the magical Oasis formula was wearing thin.  Most of the songs, although reassuringly Oasis-like initially, were starting to sound like second rate afterthoughts and leftovers, and in light of earlier triumphs, ultimately redundant and forgettable.  It was probably in part due to the major shift in personnel that had occurred in the band that they began to sound slightly more polished, but that just made it feel even more as though one was listening to an Oasis sound-alike band.  The fact that two of the songs, \\"Little By Little\\" and \\"Better Man\\", appeared on the album in weaker versions opposed to the better versions which had surfaced on the Internet prior the album's release, just added insult to injury and further gave the feeling that the band was suddenly losing it.  Despite \\"Little James\\" and \\"Songbird\\", the increased prominence of Liam as a songwriter didn't seem to help much in the long term.  In hindsight, it's almost as though, deep down, Noel knew his songwriting had dried up and that there was little to lose by letting other band members get their songs in.  2005's \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" and 2008's almost maddeningly-mediocre \\"Dig Out Your Soul\\" proved that continuing to follow this band's music was a sadly unrewarding experience, basically just a pale reflection of past glories at best.  The band who once seemed able to do little wrong musically now sounded like they were floundering to remain relevant.  I was almost completely burnt out on them as far as their new output was concerned--it had gotten to feel like there just wasn't any point anymore.<br/><br />I feel all of that preface is important.  The abudance of extraordinary music that Oasis made shouldn't be underestimated, but the group really did become a shadow of its former self musically for essentially the entire '00s (\\"Standing On the Shoulder of Giants\\" was actually recorded in 1999).  In other words, it really had been a long while since I've been excited about Oasis/Noel Gallagher as a currently active entity.  I generally try to avoid sounding all hyped up and claiming a record to be a big 'comeback', but with \\"Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds\\", it's undeniable and truly justified--I didn't think Noel would have anything like this up his sleeve at this point.  After listening, it's easy to suspect that maybe Noel really HAD been fed up with Oasis for quite a while, but considering that many, if not most, of these songs were actually written BEFORE the Oasis split, it makes the whole situation all the more curious.  But this record seems to make it clear that there was a considerable amount of pressure going on with the last few Oasis records to try and make 'Oasis-sounding product', whereas with this record, Noel is just letting his muse take him where it will, and as a result, his brilliance has re-emerged.<br /><br />Naturally, my expectations were initially low, and I just half-heartedly began listening to some of the tracks, figuring it would be more 'Oasis lite'.  But nearly every song here highlights Noel's ability to create songs with a profound, all-encompassing feel that grab you instantly while maintaining their infectiousness upon repeated listens.  Noel's vocals are almost uniformly breathtaking--he definitely underrates himself as a vocalist, and apart from maybe one or two songs, I didn't miss Liam's voice for a second.  And I'm not joking about the infectiousness of the tunes--song after song is going to have you craving another listen.<br /><br />The opening \\"Everybody's On The Run\\" instantly gives the impression that this is going to be a lot more than just more scrapings from the bottom of the Oasis barrel.  The utter absence of lead guitar, mixed with the gorgeous orchestration and faint traces of choir, present a subtle but fascinating departure from Oasis' classic anthemic sound, the kind of thing that one might call 'growth' or 'maturity' as an artist, but in the best sense of the word.  It preserves the suitably epic, albeit not overblown, feel that Oasis proved masters of time and time again, the kind of thing that cuts straight to the bone.  Noel's impassioned, echo-slathered vocals simply soar, the minute-plus intro sets the scene marvelously, and altogether, this one of the best tracks he's ever recorded.<br /><br />I'm actually surprised at how much Gallagher has to say lyrically here--it would be easy to assume that the lyrics, which even Gallagher himself tends to point out as being a weakness for him, would all be throwaways, but they aren't.  You sometimes hear about how pop music is supposed to capture the 'tenor of the times', and although I can't speak definitely about how much the wealthy Noel really worries about the state of the world, this record seems to have been dropped at the perfect time--it feels strikingly relevant and in tune with the widespread concern and uncertainty going on these days.  I already mentioned \\"Everybody's On The Run\\", a truly BELIEVABLE inspirational number, the kind of thing U2 would try to do but would only sound overblown in their hands.  \\"Soldier Boys and Jesus Freaks\\", with it's wonderfully Kinks-y \\"Autumn Almanac\\"-style rhythm, is an intriguing, sharply-etched commentary of a highly religious family whose son dies at war.  \\"Stranded On The Wrong Beach\\" seamlessly combines somewhat gentle and yearning verses with a defiant and totally infectious chorus.  And even if the lyrics to \\"Dream On\\" are 'nonsense', his sly wordplay is still incredibly entertaining.<br /><br />\\"If I Had A Gun...\\" is definitely reminiscent of earlier work, as you'll instantly think, \\"This is SO Noel-sounding\\" within the first ten seconds, but it's not a carbon copy by any means--the lyrics are beautifully-crafted--powerful and affectionate but not at all sappy--and along with the brilliantly-placed wordless vocals and subtle musical transitions, this is another absolutely terrific song.<br /><br />Noel also scores with the uptempo \\"AKA...What A Life!\\", with its heavy drums, pounding piano, a frenetic guitar solo, an ominous one-chord-style groove, and a great melody.<br /><br />At times the album becomes slightly generic-sounding, as on \\"AKA...Broken Arrow\\", but even here, the album is still memorably tuneful and remarkably enjoyable, with this particular tune being lifted by crisp acoustic guitar layers, tasty percussion, and bass work that really fills out the sound.<br /><br />The deluxe edition includes two extra songs added on at the end, including the highly haunting \\"Let The Lord Shine A Light On Me\\", which has a \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\"-era Pink Floyd quality about it--Noel's voice is actually a bit rough here and frustratingly buried in the mix, which perhaps explains its 'bonus track' status, but it's still highly worthwhile.<br /><br />But the main album portion ends with the song that Noel said was intended as the album-closer from the get-go, and understandably so.  \\"Stop The Clocks\\" has been floating around the Internet in various versions for probably close to 10 years, and it finally gets a proper version here, and Noel has simply nailed it.  I suppose it's fair to say that it was worth the wait, because it would have been a shame had it been saddled on one of the last few Oasis records in an inferior version.  Noel's vocals are, once again, exquisite, and one could hardly ask for a more fitting album-closer.  This is once again one of the absolute best tracks Noel has ever done.<br /><br />The whole saying of \\"no one buys music anymore\\" has become a virtual cliche these days, but if you're an old-school Oasis fan who lost interest in them in the 2000s, go pick up the deluxe edition of \\"Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds\\" which includes a very interesting DVD, and set aside some time to listen to the CD portion straight through in one go.  At the end of the day, I think you're going to feel like you got your money's worth on this one, and perhaps, it'll all come back to you why you loved Oasis to begin with.  Things have indeed changed since \\"Definitely Maybe\\", but \\"Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds\\" is a great album, and unmistakeably Noel.  An incredibly unexpected comeback for Noel Gallagher.

The wooden acting, absurd dialogue and crawling pace of the movie make for the perfect target.

B003UMW68O|5.0|Monsters Inc. is such a well done film. I would recommend for any family (although it can be a little scary for very young children). Definitely worth the buy.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I could hardly wait for this movie to come out and I was not disappointed.  The DVD was even better because of all of the extra behind the scenes interviews with the actors and director.  The added bonus was examples of children who stuttered and were struggling to overcome that debilitating speech defect.  The story of King George VI is even more heartbreaking because he did come from a privileged environment where you think he would've had more advantages in getting supportive treatment.  The movie shows that it was tried when he was much older and married but the techniques of holding marbles in his mouth, smoking \\"to relax the vocal cords\\" and finally his father saying to him, \\"just do it\\" when he's asked to give a broadcasted speech gave him  even greater feelings of anxiety and despair.  When he is trying to speak at an event in the beginning of the movie, I could only imagine what he must've been feeling, much less what the public must have experienced.  It's like Lionel Logue said to him before the coronation, \\"I was there that day with my son, and he said to me, \\"Can't you please help that poor man?\\"  Even though Colin Firth doesn't look like George VI, I think he portrayed him very well with the diction and stammering and obviously had studied and done a lot of research.  Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth was just charming in her role as the supportive, encouraging wife.  When Colin Firth was interviewed shortly after the movie came out, he said that the screenwriter, who also had the same condition asked the Queen Mother if he could tell the story about George VI.  The Queen Mother replied, \\"Not in my lifetime.  It was too painful.\\" This movie was inspiring in that it showed how someone could overcome an obstacle and go on to greater moments.  George VI will always be known as the monarch who displayed courage and supported the British people during those dark times during WWII as London was repeatedly bombed.  He refused to take his family and leave to safety and made it a point to stay involved during a time of need.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|To be honest, I accidentally purchased this book while trying to figure out my Prime book loan membership.  No regrets.  The book was very entertaining (minor gripes if you're a literature nut like myself but we can't all be Faulkner).  It's a fast read but I still felt satisfied with plot, character development, relationships, etc.  What a world these characters live in.  I was tempted to immediately buy the rest of the series but decided to enjoy my satisfaction in the first a bit longer.  Another plus with purchasing this particular book was that I was able to loan it out to another Kindle user.  Very fun!
B001AFF25W|5.0|I bought this book when I saw it featured for 99 cents on Daily Cheap Reads. It was a good read. It reminded me of the tools I used to use (like making lists) and gave me ways to improve on them. I found it helpful to have something to visualize (like eating a frog) to help me get through my tasks for the day (eat the biggest, baddest frog first and don't stare at it too long or you won't want to eat it). This was a good read for me and very helpful. I am much more organized already this year because of the tips I gleaned from this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really good and highly aaddictive. buy it its fun you wont regret it. I'm honestly not lying
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app works great! Very easy to set up through wifi and over the internet through linking with you gmail account. Very nice feature. I was able to play Diablo 3 from my Samsung Galaxy Tab to my surprise!
0307269981|5.0|The second installment in this series keeps up with the greatness of the first book. After reading this one I'm obligated to admit that I'm a fan of the great work of the author.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Fun, variety of games ranging from mindless shooters to slightly more complex. Worth checking out if you are looking for something new.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So far the game is great. The reviews I read before I got it were so wrong. Yes you have to play to earn points to unlock the other games but you get so many extra points from other things, like playing one game 5 times, makes it easy to unlock the games. It even gives you points just for loading the game again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun because there are a ton of games and its fun trying to earn credit to buy games in it
030726999X|5.0|There's no question about it that this is one of the best series a have ever read because from the beginning it keeps you wanting more. The third and final book of the series does not disappoint it's the web of conspiracies that holds it's unbelievable. Only a true mastermind could have come up with it.
0984074422|5.0|My family loved this book and pored over it all the time they spent at my place.  It does not provide great insight, nor is it particularly thorough, but it is a fantastic entry to global ideas and issues around food.  My only issue with it is it did seem to have a bias toward portraying the richer demographic in each society.  As a coffee table book though, an outstanding success that breaks down your own preconceived ideas about diet and provides a window into the world.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|so easy to use and has great features... bookmark verses, highlight, and sign up for your local church.. all free!!!!!!! amazing...GOD BLESS!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it so far. but honestly I think they should work on making the games better and more gameplay with them instend of making more minis
0307269752|5.0|At first I was skeptical about reading it because the title alone didn't sell it quite well. But then I gave it a try after I started reading the first 30 pages I couldn't put it down. Without a doubt is one of my favorite books.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I purchased this in order to view my computer on my 42 inch television screen. It seemed to work fine a few times then stopped working for no apparent reason. When I plug it in now my television screen just goes blank and I cannot see the computer screen on my TV. I am very busy and finally realized it was time to see if I can return it and just realized my return date was up 10 months ago.
0671835467|5.0|I bought this book for my grand daughter, this is something we should never forget. To think this child could never go outside and run and play but had to entertain herself for hours on end in silence, she is a hero to all of us.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was not shocked at how much I loved this book. It appears that the 2000's have been much better than the 90's slump that King went though. I have read every book he has ever written, and I always say the same thing: Good writer (a little long winded sometimes) and an Amazing storyteller. To think that he came up with this idea in the early 70's blows my mind. I'm glad he waited to write it I think the time difference makes the novel what it is. Plus I wasn't alive to read it back then:(  I give the book 5 stars. I love that it ended the way it did, but I would have enjoyed a little more explanation. It got to the point towards the end that King didn't even seem to understand what he meant. The yellow/black/green Card Man is a character that probably would've helped to know a little more about. He seemed to be so much a part of the story but our time with him was quite confusing.  I absolutely loved hearing from my old friends from Derry. I wish more than anything that King would continue to follow up with them on their path of life.  As far as the meat of this story, I must say I couldn't put it down, I loved it absolutely loved it!!!! This book is perfect for anybody whether you are \\"Stephen King person\\" or not. Time travel has always been a favorite subject of mine and I was a little weary of what what King's approach would be. Once again he never ceases to amaze me!!   Read it, I promise it will be worth every word. As far as my earlier comment on King being long winded, I can honestly say that there were not ANY wasted words in this book!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|fun and simple game that can become more difficult by adding more suits. try and beat your own best time and fewest moves.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|if u like to kill time with a game that offers a lot of different varieties of games, you'll love this.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|this thing is great, easy to use, but doesn't give you control abilities. hello hello hello hello hello hello
B005FITIGO|5.0|You wouldn't think that a movie about a day in the death (life?) of a financial institution would be engaging but the pace and portrayal of dread was so well crafted that I could actually feel my heart beat during the pauses as the well acted characters ponder their next deception. Hedging and leverage and high speed, high risk packaged trades at hundreds of millions a shot, often taking place in seconds, again and again throughout the day as the market and customers are manipulated is revealed by the thoughts of the traders when they were most vulnerable - when the ship's going down. The following was used to justify the unloading: \\"We are selling to willing buyers at the current market price.\\" followed by the admission of \\"We're selling something that we know has no value.\\" \\"So that we may survive.\\" Of course, as we know, from our own meltdown that the manipulators come out of it all, well compensated. They even can claim losses to the IRS. Humorously one trader claimed $76,500 for hookers and booze as an entertainment deduction. The scene of our traders looking down from their high rise roof top to the city street below revealed people as ants which is symbolic of the morality of capitalism - it's all about faceless competition, nothing else matters but to survive - wealthy. There was only token brief allusion to the moral variable surrounding the human cost of self-serving greed which, coincidentally, is more than one hears in the real world financial media of CNBC where's it's casually dismissed as the rightful reward of value added capitalism and sarcastically often pointed out that the ants should be grateful for the opportunity to dispose of the crumbs.
B0063IH60K|5.0|no issues or complaints. works great and is easy or challenging depending on settings and deals u choose. love it.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I purchased this cover when I ordered a Kindle Fire for my husband.  At that time, I paid $40 only because it was the only cover available that propped up the Fire.  By the time I received it, the price had been dropped to $30 and I was refunded the difference.  After receiving this cover and seeing the quality of it, I wouldn't have paid $20 for it.  Its great if you want a cheap little cover for your Kindle Fire, unfortunately, the price is WAY too much for what you get.  Save your money and either get a cheaper one, or pay a little more and get a higher quality item.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Intuitive, thoughtful, fast moving and enjoyable. I have only been using one suite and I will \\"skill\\" up the level of the game soon.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to navigate and read.  Easily bookmark your favorite verses; registering the app also provides you with access to your content on the developer's website.  It's a great app for the Bible!
B006RED4GA|3.0|Not a bad little ghost story, but it ultimately wasn't that scary. Really just a good movie for a slumber party, sitting around, teasing the actors, and talking back to the screen.
B001BYXO7K|5.0|If you use the flash heavily, you can end up with the batteries overheating and getting hot enough to hurt if you hold them long enough. If your next set of batteries are already in the spare cartridge, you don't have to touch the hot batteries at all (until they've cooled down.) Plus it's more convenient to have the batteries already in the cartridge, so I'm more likely to change the battery cartridge out before they get too hot in the first place.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy use, good options, love the opportunity of different translations at fingertips and reading aloud of scripture.  Easy to use while following in Bible class as well as during sermon time.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I just have to say this, and it's really no secret, but there is no other music in rock 'n roll that can compare to the Eagles.  This is a great disc to have in my collection as it is the first one they cut on their first concert after reuniting.  It is good but the Eagles Farewell One Tour disc beats it hands down.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|My grandchildren (ages 3-14) loved this beautiful book as well as the video. It was a wonderful addition to our POLAR EXPRESS (Texas State Railroad) train ride that we took during the Holidays.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old son.  He loved it, as does his 5 year old brother.  It keeps them engaged, challenges them, builds hand-eye coordination, AND keeps them off TV/video games!  However, after only about 2 weeks of use, like one of the other comments posted, the \\"bucket\\" at or just before #119 broke loose and is now free-floating inside, and so it is no longer possible to reach the end, and the bucket now occasionally blocks the path.  Having purchased this at a local boutique toy store, I figured I was stuck with the defective toy.  Not so!  After following the lead of other people that commented, I contacted Sue at plasmacar.com, and in less than 24 hours, I had multiple follow up e-mails, and they are now sending out a replacement unit!  That's what I call excellent customer service.  Hopefully, this was a lot specific issue (they did ask for the date code on mine - it was 25111B).  I'll follow up with another post when the new unit arrives and it's had at least 2 weeks of use, to see how it compares quality-wise.
B004HUE57S|5.0|This mouse is definitely a good investment. My forearm was starting to ache and knot up because of the constant heavy computer use at work. I had to think twice because of the price, but it's definitely worth it. I use the computer all day, every day. And 300 hours later... I'm very glad I purchased this mouse. I don't have forearms that are in pain anymore.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game to waste time. you can read the description of a game before unlocking to make sure you want to play it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its an okay game, I don't really like that you have to earn points to unlock more games but the games are fun :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nice game. I enjoyed the time wasting expierienced if only the serpent game weren't as bad and more like snake game
0316044695|5.0|I rate this book in my top 10 of all time. An unbelievable story of honor persistence and fortitude. This is truly a book I feel every American should read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this has a lot of fun games and the games have endless possibilities. I really like this item and it wont be deleted
B002IVLH60|4.0|There's absolutely nothing worse than hearing a mature rock band try to sound young and dangerous.  For Seattle's Pearl Jam it was a trap they fell into in the late 90s and early 2000s as records like Binaural and Riot Act felt so heavy-handed that the guys seemed to forget \\"oh yeah, we're a rock band, this can be fun.\\"<br /><br />In 2006, the band took a step in the right direction with their self-titled album writing songs that brought the band back to writing great hard rock with the occasional dabble into ballad territory (Parachutes). It seemed to be a statement that Pearl Jam was willing to sound like Pearl Jam again.<br /><br />Three years later with Backspacer the lessons learned on their last record seemed to have been engrained as the band fully embraces a relaxed energy that seems an honest representation of a group well into their career.  This dynamic is vocalized brilliantly by Eddie Vedder on the first single The Fixer \\"when something's dark, let me shed a little light on it\\" in a song that seems ready made to fill hockey arena's with its big catchy chorus.<br /><br />This acceptance as one of rocks now elder statesmen allows the band to write songs such as Just Breath, which finally gives Pearl Jam fans the wedding song they've likely always secretly wanted. One can't imagine such a straight forward heart-warming ballad appearing on any previous PJ record but on Backspacer the band seems willing to finally write fun, energetic rock n roll.
B006O5XYWG|3.0|I don't know why they even label this joke of a film \\"Planet Of The Apes\\". The acting is horrible along with having no plot at all. No plot and really rushed, which could've been steller or atleast worth the time viewing. Although, the apes do look pretty empressing. Ceasar is put togethor really well, especially with his emotions. I also liked how they showed segments of him getting older. If they would've took time at developing a very well written story with a plot rather than leaving the viewer dissapointed and also bringing better actors into the work. All you need to know is that Apes break out and are loose. That is the story. Very dry and poorly put together. Don't waste yuour time watching all the way through if an adult, but I think that it is a good eye pleaser for children.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I had been looking for an app like this for a while. It does exactly what I want- access my home laptop with my phone!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is hard but its an amazing fun and addictive app i absolutely love it i going to play it right now
B005TBN3EU|1.0|The original hangover was funny and good. This part II completely failed. It was absolute waste of money and my time. Amazon's on demand streaming over Roku box was seamless though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a FANTASTIC book (and a great series)! I couldn't put it down! If you're a fan of YA literature, then you'll love this book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this its like getting a whole bunch of mini games for free if you don't have this app you need to get it ASAP you wont regret it
0465068367|5.0|[[ASIN:0465068367 The Rape Of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust Of World War II]]  Hitler and the Jews?  The world has heard over and over about the terrible and violent genocide of millions in Europe.  But the same or worse in China at the hands of Japanese soldiers, military leaders, their government and the world stood by?  A dear friend mentioned in passing the 'butcher of Nanking'.  Questioning him, he told me a little about what happened before the US got involved in a war with Japan. A search brought up this book.    This woman does a remarkable service for those who cannot speak for themselves, bringing to light the horrific, heinous acts of men who claimed to be human.  My heart still has trouble dealing with vicious, demonic acts she details.  Her narrative is backed by historical evidence, eye-witness accounts and interviews with surviving victims as well as those who were part of this monstrous assault on humanity at every level.  Schools should be including this in their history lessons in every corner of the world.  And yet, for all my years, have never heard a whisper of this atrocity until now. Read, remember, and resolve that never again should anyone be allowed to practice suffering, torture and insanity as happened in Nanking.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nice and easy to do so you should got this game and have fun with it. until you have to spend points on other stuff
0553801473|1.0|This is by far the book I've had most problems getting through. I mostly read books before going to sleep and normally have no problem staying awake and never fall asleep mid-sentence. With this book I managed 10-20 pages each night before falling asleep with the book in my lap.
B004O2HAMG|5.0|I did not watch \\"Lonesome Dove\\" when it first appeared on TV. It wasn't until 5 years later that I discovered what a work of art this movie really was/is. Since then I have watched it once every year. I will never get bored with this genius epic.
0439023513|5.0|If you haven't yet read this series, then buy it, check it out from the library, or download it ASAP.  You'll be dying for the movie to come out.  I fell in love with these characters, and the future setting was really intriguing.  Very well written, and the plot is excellent, although I think it could have been accomplished in 2 books rather than 3.  Still a must-read!
030726999X|4.0|As always I enjoyed reading the last of this trilogy. Finding out the author has passed, I feel all readers are missing out on more writing.
0757302661|5.0|I took the hypnobirthing class for my first child, and then used this book and the accompanying CD on my own. I practiced the \\"Rainbow Relaxation\\" track upwards of 50 times. The morning I went into labour, I spent a few hours in the bathtub doing the rainbow relaxation, resting, and watching comedy on Netflix with my iPod. Then I went to bed, continuing the Rainbow relaxation, and was so relaxed that I slept between the contractions (and through many of them). My water broke, and I went into active labour. I was so relaxed and pleasantly groggy that there was no pain, and my daughter was born 20 minutes later. I can't say enough great things about this system.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I got this as a free app and loved it so much I bought the HD version. Connects easily to both my PC and Mac. This is truly a must have, especially if you own a tablet.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Only played a few of the games so far but they have been fun. Some of the controls are a little awkward, but you get the hang of them quickly.
B0055SWM08|5.0|love love the peaceful music. a very relaxing  game both the kids and i enjoy. quite addictive.  very zen.I would recommend. this one to anyone
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a fairly fairly decent game. could use less ads for points, but oh well. all in all pretty fun.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The game is good for a free one. But it requires a lot of points to get a new game and you don't earn points very fast.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|There's a huge amount of games. You have to play the first few before you'll have enough points to unlock the rest. Looks like it will take quite a while to unlock them all.
B004T32SOK|5.0|The perfect app for my new Kindle Fire. Works amazingly well and the new upload features are great. Keep up the fantastic work!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|found this game very satisfiying and have found no big fault so far. . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .c.c.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works well with the kindle fire, smooth app. few adds, no annoying glitches that I have found so far. great game!
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Read some of the reviews on this album.  Not quite sure I got the lower ratings.  I thought this album was great from start to finish.  There aren't too many albums I can put on and play each song without skipping a few songs.
B0060FXBNM|2.0|Don't buy it, because the second one is the worst, the third is okay, and the first is the best, but don't buy this, because you're wasting your money on a horrible sequel. The only good things in this in this box set are just the first and the third, but buying the second is wasting your money, so yeah don't buy it.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I've been browsing some of the negative reviews people gave this show out of mere curiosity of what could have induced people to give a - for the most part - excellently acted and well-scripted story with strong visuals and worthy cliffhangers a one-star rating, and noticed that a significant amount of one-star raters are history students and / or hobbyists with in depth knowledge of the historical figures portreyed in this show, expressing their dissatisfaction with the historical inaccuracies present here.  As any show or movie centered around well-known historical figures, this one too should be open to criticism on counts of not being historically accurate, in that spirit, those reviews are definitely legit. I'm just a bit disappointed as to how they thought the lack of historical accuracy in parts was worth smearing this with a 1 star rating, seeing as this seemed to be the only reason for the abysmal rating they gave (that I could tell from many a 1 star review). Question for all you one-star raters on counts of it being historically inaccurate, is it really worth giving it a 1 star rating just because of that? I've watched movies in the past in which something I happen to know a lot about was awfully portrayed, but it never let it blind me into dismissing the otherwise solid elements of the story. If it's entertainment, I'll rate it first and foremost by its ENTERTAINMENT value, which is usually infinitely higher than the rating I'd give it for accurate portreyal. (Let's start with the portreyal of ethnic minorities and disabilities in most major films ... yech, but I'll live...) Makes me think all these people are jaded and way too serious for their own good to enjoy some good entertainment when they find it. Nobody said they'd be showing this in classrooms, right?   As for \\"this is just about JRM having sex\\"... that's historically accurate. The historical figure had lots and lots of sex. You guys should be happy, actually. If excessive sex bothers you, don't go near any \\"adult fantasy\\" books or games or Game of Thrones (another quality series based on quality books). Just saying.  It's been a while since I watched season 1 but I remember watching it on TV where I'd catch a new episode every week, and you can bet that I marked it down on the calendar to make sure I had nothing else going on at that time. I loved the gritty feel, the clever intrigues, the intelligent scriptwriting, the meaningful cliffhangers and the solid characters, the music, the scenery - yes, it owned me for a while. For anyone looking for a gripping, worthy show to watch, this is a show I'd recommend to just about anyone. Don't let the jaded historians put you off, folks. And yes, this show does live up to its trailers, which is a rarity nowadays in my opinion.   A definite must watch and a big recommendation from me.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Got this the day it came out (well I got charged that day anyway, it took Amazon over a week to actually get it to my house..)  Overall the sound is similar to Endgame, if you liked that album you will probably like this one.  The sound has evolved from what it used to be, some people like it and some don't.  I own all of the Megadeth albums and find this one growing on me more and more as I listen to it in my car.
B004ZN9ERI|5.0|PROBABLY ONE OF THE BETTER REMASTERS I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME.  LOOKING FORWARD TO PURCHASING THE OTHER PINK FLOYD REMASTERS.  WELL WORTH A LISTEN.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|At first i was hesitant to purchase this item based on some reviews, but it is a perfect match for the kindle fire.  Sleek, slim, fits the device perfectly, durable material that is easy to grip.  I highly recommend this product - it is a great value for the money.  It shipped to me in two days, and looks great.  Inside of the cover flap is a soft surface which acts like a cloth to keep dust off the screen, and after you break the cover in a bit, the stand functionality works great on a level surface.  I was concerned about the elastic strap and how it would hold up, but it is a well made product and i am extremely satisfied with the purchase.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|for a free game this is pretty cool. there a few games in the app that doesn't make sense. but overall not.bad
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is so awesome great idea makes you want to keep playing more and more and more and more and more
B0054JZC6E|4.0|no matter who gets a hold of my kindle there is game for everyone on this app!  The ability to unlock more is great. wish there was more apps like it...
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can access work files or turn on my home cameras.  Using the default resolution works best on my kindle.  You have to go down to settings on the app to sign into Google and find Internet computers.  Directions were not clear on that.
0307279189|5.0|The topic, information and writing style were all outstanding. McDougall was very engaging and yet was able to deftly minimize his first person presence. The story made me want to do two things, get out and run and read the book a second time.   McDougall presents many brilliant bits of information without belaboring the point and mixes in a surprising amount of humor. I also found the pacing of the book to be worthy of an ultra distance writer. Thank you Christopher McDougall.
B002GHHHPQ|1.0|I really got screwed because the product information indicated this was a dvd in widescreen format.  When I played it on my blu ray player (I frequently playback dvd's on my blu ray) the only format it would play in is the square screen or non-widescreen format.  The image was also quite grainy.  I suppose I will have to wait for this movie to be available in widescreen blu ray before I will be satisfied.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Watched the YouTube video for this product, and it \\"sold\\" me. I bought this cover for my grandson's Kindle Fire.  I felt great, looked great, and was everything the product make claimed.  Very satisfied.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is an american classic that I had to get for my friend for her collection. I recived it in a timely matter and the package and disc were in perfect condition
0316056871|5.0|Normally I don't read autobiographies, they make me uncomfortable. I decided to take the chance on Tina Fey's Bossypants and I am glad I did. Bossypants was hilarious, Tina Fey's ability to apply self effacing humor to her life really puts the reader in her shoes and you get a glimpse into the experiences that make her the woman she is today. She's not looking for admiration or adulation from feminist cults, she justs her and that's how it is.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works great on a kindle. it's a basic solitaire game but it's nice to play the winning hands. I recommend it

0439023521|5.0|I do not usually read sci-fi/dystopian world novels but The Hunger Games was so exciting. I love the strength of the main character. I will definately read this book again, I haven't read anything that's jazzed me like this book in a while.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app works for those who love to play minigames like me! different variety and tons of fun! some games can be frustrating though
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I loved it I could not stop playing it so much fun it has lots of games and they are very hard sometimes
B002LVUKJ2|5.0|I have enjoyed these games ever since I purchased them through Amazon.  I had all the older ones at one time but did not have the more recent ones.  Now I have all of the games for less than the price of the first one I bought several years ago.  The game play is smooth.  Make sure you have your system ready to play them.  My \\"game\\" computer has no internet connection and I needed a patch for some of the graphics which I had to download from a flash-drive to put on my computer.  I had forgotten how much fun these games were for me!
B00006I53S|5.0|I'm finally getting back into photgraphy, I used to do alot with a very old pantec 35mm SLR.  By far this is one of the nicest lenses I have ever owned.  Its not the top of the line one i want, but for an ametuer photographer, you can get some great shots.  I have not taken this lens off my camera since I have getten it.  Great Auto focus speeds when I actually even turn that on.  Zoom is great range for walk around lens.  I'm very happy with my purchase and I thin you will be too when you buy this.  PS get the package deal with the Tulip for a couple bucks more, it really helps with sun when you are doing outdoor shots!  Hope this helped!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|pretty fun little mini games, some are confusing at first because there aren't directions but also time consuming to unlock all games.
0439023521|4.0|This book is filled with surprises and turns on each corner. It can be a little boring at times but worth reading to the end.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|There was a great deal of anticipation for Il Divo's newest CD.  They had taken a long time to choose and record songs, and their fans were hungry for new material.  Il Divo did not disapoint.  I love all of their music, but \\"Wicked Games\\" is undeniably their best CD to date.  The songs are dramatic, lush and filled with emotion.  Each song has a beautiful balance between tenderness and passion, with a climactic finish, which is their signature style.  And several of the songs have been made famous in movies, or by other artists; yet Il Divo is very skilled in redesigning each song as their own.  I have a different favorite every day.  Il Divo have surpassed themselves, and it's amazing their ability to recapture the devotion and renew the enthusiasm of every fan.  I highly recommend this CD!
140053271X|5.0|I choose this product because it's capable of support diferent formats, I convert my pdf files in EPUB whit free programs (calibre and sigil) and mi readings are now easy and the graphics are visualized correctly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love it! some games are a little confusing but once u get the hang of it its all good. never bored.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|The performance at the London Colliseum was the first time in 18 months that Il Divo performed in front of an audience.  The crowd's enthusiasm and response is palpable through the DVD.  They were thrilled to be hearing familiar favorites and the new songs from these men they had missed so much.  All the new material, from their album \\"Wicked Game\\", is dynamic, charasmatic and inspiring.  The interaction between the singers is pure joy to watch - they are obviously so happy to be back on stage and performing for their fans.  They have fun with the performances and keep it light-hearted in conversations to the audience, between songs.  This DVD portrays Il Divo at their very best - beautiful songs, amazing voices and a never-ending charm with their delivery.  If this is an example of the show they will present on their next world-wide tour, it will be a resounding success.  I loved every gorgeous moment of this DVD.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|if you love a short break from.routine these games will fill.just what u.need. it brings back some classic favorites like snake and tons of new games. definatly worth the free price tag!!
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Fun, sci-fi show, that I am watching over and over. The movie was good as well, provide some closure, but I would like much much more. Sky is the limit for the story line. Sadly, it was canceled.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|seems like a fun little game with plenty of things to work twords. graphics could be better and.games could be.alittle more indepth
B006FPFTMS|1.0|I use the Pc version and like it. I tried the kindle version, which only shows when an App is \\"compatible\\" it doesn't work on the fire. save your money!
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Intro:<br /><br />In my opinion if you like dive watches, this model is a must have.  Dive watches aren't just for diving, they make the best beater watches because they are built extra tough and the Seiko line of dive watches are built extra-extra tough.<br /><br />Watch Model:<br /><br />The watch being reviewed is the SKX007K2 which is the black dialed black bezel version.  There is another model called the SKX009K2 that has a blue dial and pepsi colored bezel.<br /><br />Watch Movement:<br /><br />This model has an automatic movement in it as opposed to a battery operated quartz movement.  The automatic movement, known in Rolex circles as \\"perpetual\\" has a pendulum and clutch that moves when you move your arm.  This is unnoticed by the wearer.  The wearer's motion keeps the main spring constantly wound.  This particular model uses the Seiko 7S26(A or B) caliber movement.  I suspect that if you purchase this watch now you'll get the 7S26B version.  The B version has a couple of improvements over the A version and you can read about them if you do a search on it.  The 7S26 caliber movement can be compared to the Miyota (Citizen) 8215 movement found in the Invicta line of watches like the Invicta 8926 Submariner homage.  Both movements have 21 jewels, and both are non-hacking.  But, the Myota can be manual wound and the Seiko cannot.  The Seiko will wind in both pendulum directions and the Myota only winds in one pendulum direction.  Both movements have about the same accuracy and same power reserves.  For those of you that are environmentally conscious, this is the \\"greenest\\" type of watch movement.<br /><br />Watch Bracelet:<br /><br />The bracelet is a stainless steel jubilee style bracelet.  The name \\"jubilee\\" comes from Rolex and is an iconic bracelet found on the Rolex Datejust and Day/Date models.  The Seiko bracelet is actually a very good quality bracelet given the price point of this watch.  The center links are folded, but the ends are solid.  This makes a very solid yet light bracelet that is very comfortable and strong.  Seiko also sells a very comfortable rubber strap for this watch that is not too expensive.<br /><br />Watch Size:<br /><br />The watch is right around 40mm without the crown.  With the crown it's around 43mm.  The crown is at the four o'clock position which makes is very comfortable.  The watch is around 13mm thick.  The width and height are important numbers to determine if a watch will feel balanced on the wrist.  The Seiko numbers are very good for providing a well balanced feel on the wrist.  The lug width is 22mm which is a common width for dive watches.  This means that you can find a lot of aftermarket straps and bracelets that will fit this watch if you want to experiment.<br /><br />Watch Case:<br /><br />The case is a combination polished and brushed stainless steel.  This combination is a time tested classic look.  The shape of the case has smooth lines with no pointy or pokey areas on the watch.  The case reminds me of the way the Japanese create a sense of ergonomics like no one else can.  The uni-directional bezel is a double coin edge type that is both functional and great looking.  It has a glow in the dark flat oyster at the twelve o'clock position.  The crown is at the four o'clock position and screws down.  There is a rubber gasket in the crown so that when it is screwed down it will make the watch \\"water proof.\\"  The case also has a crown protector which creates a barrier from damage.  This is imperative on a beater tool watch.<br /><br />Watch Face:<br /><br />The face is black.  The hour markers are large dots with differentiators at the six, nine, and twelve o'clock positions.  These markers are coated with a luminescent material (Lumibrite) that glows in the dark.  When looking at the watch in pitch black conditions, it is totally readable.  The hands are iconic of this watch.  The most striking is the minute hand.  It is large and draws the eye to it.  This is important when diving because you are most concerned with the number of minutes you've spent down.  The seconds hand is identifiable because of the lollipop at one end so it is unmistakable in low light conditions.  All the hands are glow in dark.  It has a day/date display that can display either English or Spanish, and is highly readable.  The crystal is made out of a Seiko proprietary material known as \\"Hardlex.\\"  Most watches have crystals that are made out of either mineral or sapphire.  Mineral crystals have the benefit of being flexible so they can take a knock without breaking, but they scratch easy.  Sapphire crystals are virtually impossible to scratch without a diamond, yet they are not flexible so they can shatter.  Hardlex is somewhere in between and performs very well in this regard.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Perhaps this watch can be considered as one of the all time greatest watches at any price?hen diving because you are most concerned with the number of minutes you've spent down.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is great and really helps in my walk with God! You have to download the different versions such as kjv,or niv then you will be able to view without wifi! And the devotions are awesome! crashes here and there but that's ok!
B006RED4GA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie!  I have followed Ti West since he made The Roost, and have loved his movies since then. One thing about West is that he stays true to his vision, whether it is popular or not, and in this case, I think it works - plenty of atmosphere, suspense, laughs, and a creepy ending that delivers!  The cast is great, and Jeff Grace's score is amazing, as always.   As a huge horror fan, I am tired of the crap-tastic 80's remakes, and cheezy \\"found footage\\" that plague the industry right now.  I urge anyone who liked The Innkeepers at all to see it in theaters, if possible.  For that matter, check out all of the great indie horror coming out - Troll Hunter, Before the Mask, etc...  Movie quality will not change if fans continue supporting the status quo!
1591843790|5.0|Guy Kawasaki has a knack for communication, and an understanding that is really special.<br /><br />This book provides both great advice and excellent vision. Any business owner, manager, or coach would benefit from reading this book.
B0068FYZ3Y|5.0|Bought this combo pack on Day 1, only to be dismayed that the Digital Copy code did not work in iTunes as advertised. Thankfully, the issue has now been resolved, and now the DC codes will work until the end of the year. My review has been adjusted to reflect this fact. I think this is a fantastic deal as you get one of the best movies released in the past five years on all three formats for a great price. Another word to the wise, though: only buy one of the Universal 100th Anniversary combo packs at a time. Each one comes with an offer code for their sweepstakes with a guaranteed minimum prize of $3 off your next 100th Anniversary combo pack purchase. If you're a movie fanatic like me, the savings could add up quick.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When they make it into a movie, John, will you please make sure that the sister who is supposed to die is actually the sister that dies?    Is joke!  Get it!  Ha ha, funny joke!  Anyway, \\"Paper Towns\\" sits next to my bed and on nights when my depression wins the battle over my Ambien and long, droning episodes of Fresh Air, it sings a soft, improvised song so at least I don't spend those darkest hours in an inescapable silence.  It gives a lyrical poetry to those places that don't exist in which you always get trapped.  Poetry has rules, you see, even if it skips a line or two - because it's a sonnet whether the lovers become that final couplet or no - and all poetry's rules mean the marks on the map creating places only you have been before have rules that may eventually make you into a couplet, even if the poem doesn't start out with one.  I doubt \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" will be staying up besides me and \\"Paper Towns\\" those night or nights in-between.  But I have plenty of other moments in my life that are too still to be safe, still enough to leave me with a brain that's not quiet right, and a self with so little barriers from that something wicked that comes but from which way? And from those other readers, \\"Fault\\" will notice, even through my silence, and give me a warning as far in advance as it knows and hold my hand as long as I need anyway, even if it can't tell either.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Excelent! This piece of simple plastic will give you piece of mind when sticking your kendle fire in your bag. It protect the screen from getting scrathed. It also makes a great stand.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is great and will give u hours enjoyment and fun! the thing is that all of the games just start right away so it should have the option of showing the instructions instead of just throwing u into it. but overall good app for free.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and challenging. hours of entertainment and a range of difficulty. would recommend this to all of my friends. amazing!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its a good game. I enjoy it! It has a lot of different and creative games. I enjoy it because I wont get bored anymore with this game.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Got this present for my son, but it was really because it looked fun for us all. We took it to our New Year's Party and it ended up being one of the only games everyone played. Great if you like strategy. The more you play it the more you want to.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app &amp; use it daily! I listen to it at night before I go to sleep. I like the Bible plans as well. Haven't found a plan to help study the prophecy; showing the connections between the old &amp; new testaments, and things yet to come...that would be one I'd really like! Only complaint so far is it seems to lose connection to my wifi for some reason...not sure if it's the app or kindle fire. It seems like you need wifi even though you can download the Bible version you choose to your device.
B006VA3ZT6|5.0|The greatly anticipated second series of Downton Abbey picks up two years on from the first series in 1916, in the middle of World War 1. Downton Abbey has been converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen and the action covers the period from the Battle of the Somme up to the end of the war. As in the first series, topical events of the period, political, economic and military are covered.<br /><br />The wartime scenario and the convalescent home setting provide an excellent background for some interesting story lines. The combination of excellent plot lines, great acting and the superb setting display all that is best in TV period drama. This time round we have eight more episodes to add to the seven in the first series. As befits wartime, the costumes are not as flamboyant as in the first series but they are thoroughly researched and appropriate to the period.<br /><br />There continue to be many superb individual performances but mention must be made of Maggie Smith. What a stroke of genius to cast her as Violet. She dominates every scene she appears in and often has some very funny lines.<br /><br />The UK has a long tradition of producing fine period dramas and this is the most successful since the early 1980s when [[ASIN:B005GP7ELW Brideshead Revisited: 30th Anniversary Edition]] took the world by storm. Peak viewing figures in the UK are 11m which is an astounding number for that market. It is pleasing to learn that a third series is already planned and we now know that this will cover an 18 month period from 1920 to 1921. This one is likely to run and run and I would not be surprised to see Downton Abbey continuing up to the 1930s eventually.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|great movie, great graphics. 5 out of 5. if you don't buy blu-ray then you're an idiot. can't wait for a sequel to come out.
1416950176|4.0|A book that came recommended from my online reading friends.<br /><br />A bit mysterious. A bit about fairies. A little scary. Perfect for kids.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|awesome game, amazing how such a simple game is so addicting! :) actually it got me in trouble in class cuz i cant put it down. lol
145162445X|5.0|A great thing about this work by Dr. Krauss is it really ties up a lot of questions and concerns people have of the formation of the universe. As with all science though, he doesn't expect you to just take it on faith, and he explains why things are the way they are, and HOW we learned this to be true. He is also clear about what is thought to be known and what is just a decent guess and that is a sincerely refreshing and helpful to people like myself who are just looking for answers. There simply aren't many other books out there which cover the things Dr. Krauss goes over and if you are new to learning about cosmology or the sciences in general, or even if you have a degree in a field, I feel this book could become a standard read in short time because of it's scope and aim to answer one of those fundamental questions of humanity with reality, and not mysticism.
0307593312|5.0|I've been reading Murakami books for the last couple of years and he has become my favorite author.  Amazing story writing.  He really brings you into another world.  MUST READ!
B0019OP0GU|3.0|No blood, no smoking tires, no serial killers! And yet no boredom and falling asleep!  Invite Your grand daughter and enjoy it! Sweet girls in a lovely story!  Everything is fine in this little movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|tons of different games, each with lots of rewards. you initially start with a handful of games and earn money for each game you complete, and buy new games with your earnings. lots of rewards.
B000784WMW|5.0|You might among the numerous other versions find one with better scenography and delicious photography. But what I like in this one is the lack of strange ideas in the mind of the director. The story is being told as it is! What still needs to be included from the book, is not worth mentioning. All of it is there. It is long enough to pass all from the mind of the auther on to us. Is is complete!  And on the front cover, we see Timothy Dalton in the foreground. For good reason! He is nothing but sublime!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is actually an impressive app. I like the unlocking of everything and epspecially how its free. i woukd reccomend this app to any one who is need of a time waster .
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the full screen play on my kindle fire. I also really like the touch and play action on the cards.  Lots of time spent playing this game.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The first two chapter were somewhat interesting, but after that it got very bland.  It was like the author was trying to get somewhere, but was killing off all the main character and left you without any sense as to what just happened.  Did I fall asleep and just passed all the intigue and why he was going the way he went.  It left me high and dry without any reason. Very disappointing, after reading the first 4 books that were so great, now this one horrible.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the bible app! I love that it is free. It is easy to navigate. I love the many versions available.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I am pleased with the range of difficulty. It can be quite challenging. The interface is smooth. It is a very polished program.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My wife received her Fire for Christmas - She loves it - She will primarily use it as an E-Reader but she loves the web access and apps available - It is a great tablet for personal use.  Great for the money - a great value
B005TBN3EU|5.0|I loved the first Hangover, but was skeptical regarding a sequel. However, after watching it, and laughing pretty much the whole time, i almost feel like this was better than the first. Certainly, they upped the disturbing humor quotient. The situations they find themselves in are pretty awesome. This time, they lose Stew's soon to be brother in law, a 16 year old child prodigy/Stanford student...and what they go through to find him...oh man! You may gag when they go to the strip club, and might feel bad for the little monkey, but really, this movie has it all...<br />You know, i may just have to visit Bangkok...and hope the city doesnt take me.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B000JMLFLW|5.0|Absolutely amazing! Probably my favorite book ever, and that's a lot coming from an English major. Most would agree it's Austen's best work.

0307593525|5.0|I gave these books to one of my daughters who is a housewife.  She does a lot of cooking.  During the Christmas party she stopped me three times to tell me how much she appreciated the gift.  Today I called to tell her that I was reviewing the purchase.  She told me about a grated squash recipe that the whole family (husband, 10, 9, and 5 year old children) loved.  She's made other recipes including her first rabbit.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I love everything about this cover. I love that everyone who sees it thinks it's a real book. The fit is perfect for my Kindle Fire. It holds it securely and I have had no issues with the spine not laying the right way as other reviewers have commented on. I have no complaints and love being a happy customer!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|yes I love it, does a nice job of keeping the Kindle fire clean. Easy to use . Fits snug. Like the Rubber band to hold it together.

B0036G8IQS|5.0|This book is my favorite book I have ever read! I read the whole series but over all The Lightning Thief is the BEST! In my opinion it is better than Harry Potter!

B001JEPVDM|4.0|I was debating to myself whether to give this three or four stars. I ended up with four largely because I felt that the importance of the book as a chronicle (a chronicle in the classical sense) of the Rwandan Genocide, as well as its positives in general, outweighed the negatives.<br /><br />As a positive, the book is well written in a certain respect. Dallaire is clear, consise and to the point. He also apparently knows what he wants to say, and doesn't skirt the issue. All of this results in what might not be a traditional \\"easy read,\\" but at least in a relatively brisk one.<br /><br />Stylistically, though, I think Dallaire stumbles. It's obvious that he's a soldier and not an author, and while this leads to the no-nonsense prose detailed above, it can also lead him to an overuse of cliche. I must have read, when Dallaire was describing a building, \\"it was a _____ affair,\\" at least ten times throughout the book, just as an example. But, truly, this is the editor's failure, and I'm hesitant to lay the blame squarely at Dallaire's feet.<br /><br />Also positive is the fact that Dallaire, despite his overall structure, does manage to create a set of somewhat vibrant characters that appear and re-appear. The enigmatic Paul Kagame, for example, or the competent and loyal subordinates of Dallaire's command, such as Henri Anyidoho.<br /><br />On the negative side, his structure as a whole is purely chronological. On one hand I get the idea that extraneous information was weeded out, but on the other hand, I feel that Dallaire and his editors were too merciful. A good deal could have been taken from the text.<br /><br />On top of all of this, it is in many cases a dry repeat of events. To some degree this makes sense, I suppose - Dallaire wants us to follow him through his deployment to Rwanda. But on the other hand, I think it hurts his semi-stated aim of Mea Culpa, since a true Mea Culpa should come through analysis and retrospection. Dallaire avoids all of that, and while there are (precious few) tidbits of analysis, they're generally short and tacked on to the daily report. What so-and-so was thinking, what such-and-such was doing behind the scenes and how it fit in, etc.. It would have been stronger if he had developed the analysis explicitly and over time through various sections of the book.<br /><br />For a book that is, in many ways, a Mea Culpa, Dallaire shirks having to do much personal analysis on the Rwandan Genocide and how it affected him, other than little morsels and a sentence here and there. How did it affect his family life? How did it affect his career? These issues are briefly mentioned in the introduction, but never touched on afterwards. He mentions he gave a soldirly farewell to his eldest son, instead of a fatherly one, and mentions that would come back to haunt him, but he never explains why.<br /><br />All in all, it would have been better as a personal retrospective than a dry reportage. It would have fit the subject matter, too - an actual historical account of the Rwandan Genocide would have been best served by an author writing on the players from a third person omniscient perspective. Dallaire's first person perspective hamstrings any attempt at an actual chronicle of events because it's far too one sided - we know of Kagame, for instance, pretty much only what Dallaire has encountered in him. A recitation of events and interviews on one side doesn't make for a good chronicle. It would have been far more potent as a personal reflection on his work there, fitted out with analysis on the powers and players and himself that was lacking in the often clinical and detached repeat of each day's events.<br /><br />None of this makes it a bad book - it's quite a good book. It gives the reader a wonderful inside look at the Rwandan Genocide by a by all accounts stalwart and competent commander. I just wonder if he made a mistake on the form.lysis, they're generally short and tacked on to the daily report.

B0002E5O9G|5.0|I have only less than a handful of music that I always make sure is there wherever I go. On my iPods, Zune, iPhone, car, home, etc. This is one of those.<br /><br />Now, as far as different production goes, the 10th Anniversary Concert is by far my personal favorite. There are 5 reasons:<br /><br />1. Colm is the definitive Valjean. Anyone who says different obviously have not read the original novel or understand the character. His voice is a little bit eerie/ghoulish that is perfect for a man who's been 20 years chained like a slave, broken, and lost everything he had. Yet there is strength behind it. All other Valjeans are either way too operatic/strong or too weak.<br /><br />2. If you aren't convinced Colm is the best Valjean, I'll give you another reason why this is the best Les Mis production: Javert, by Philip Quast. He IS Javert. Period. A mean, cold, calculating, nasty inspector. His voice and performance are both top notch. If Philip Quast gets a 10 as Javert, then the 25th Anniversary at O2's Javert is a 3 at best.<br /><br />3. Ruthie as Fantine. She is the definitive Fantine as well.<br /><br />4. The Thenardiers. Alun and Galloway are the BEST masters of the house.<br /><br />5. Micheal Ball<br /><br />6. Eponine.<br /><br />....Okay, I know I've listed 6, but you got the idea. This concert is called the \\"Dream Cast\\" for a reason.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I was very impressed with this book. It was much more \\"vintage\\" Stephen King than ones I have read in the recent past. An excellent insight into \\"yesterday\\" especially if you were around in 1958 to 1963. I really got to know the characters and the settings were fairly accurate. I recommend it.

Their mom was dubious but we all watched and loved it.  Great film for spending some quality time with the kids.

Overall, the film itself is cute, intriguing, and heartfelt.<br /><br />The blu-ray is of great quality. The visuals are outstanding and the audio is superb.

0525478817|5.0|This review isn't going to contain a summary of the book, because of a vlogbrothers requesting there be no spoilers about the book itself. Instead, I will focus more so on the quality of him as an author, versus this book's plot itself. However, let me say that this is John Green at his best. It has extreme highs, and new levels of low, and it catches every emotion in between.  The power of John Green's writing isn't that he writes \\"about\\" teenagers, but rather \\"for\\" teenagers. Many authors who write about teenagers often times glorify the young adult life, with the over done romantics and an endless amount of everyone-gets-what-they-want. They do not catch real life, instead of including the bumps and scratched caused by fighting with parents, or swearing, or just doing stupid teenagery-type things, they smooth them over and play up the love between character A and character B.  John Green, on the other hand, writes for teenagers, and this is why I have so much respect for him as an author. In all of his books, he captures what teenagers really do in most of his books, silly half-baked plans that somehow manage to work, the fact that we do swear, and the occasional sexual experience. The only way I can describe his writing style is by saying it is honest. He captures the things that we sometimes miss, like crustless sandwiches, the guilty pleasure of reality TV shows, or those moments in time that stretch on for an infinity in our minds (even if they only happened for a minute or two in real life). A comparison that I can think of to explain my opinion better, is that many authors write similar to this: \\"I got this cool scar by wrestling with an Alligator\\", which highlights and two things: 1. I have a cool scar and 2. I wrestled an Alligator. Instead, John Green's style is much more: \\"I got this scar by wrestling with an Alligator, I cried some, and it hurt a lot, and there was a ton of blood, and I lost a pinky... Man I miss my pinky.\\"  In addition to John Green'sability to capture the little details that are often times forgotten in the grander schemes, he also is an amazing crafter of stories. He layers and blends in foreshadowing wonderfully, creates deliciously quotable quotes, infuses tons of humor, and creates characters so fleshed out I feel I know them better than many people in my high school class. Another reason why I am a fan of John Green's work (especially The Fault in Our Stars) is the tone that he writes with and the character voice. For me, his books feel like a bedtime story, the kind that you want to hear to relax you, keep you awake to know what happens, but always want to save a sliver because you never want them to end, and when you finally finish the book it has a sense of completeness to it that, very rarely, leaves me wondering: \\"What Happens Next?\\" His writings are delectable, and The Fault in Our Stars is a fine addition to his other works, and is probably my favorite book of his to date.  Even with John Green reading the first two chapters of The Fault in Our Stars on his and his brother's youtube channel, I really did not know what to expect. It was an addicting read, and one that I could not put down until it ended. Then I read it again, because I did not want the journey to stop. If you are on the fence about this book, I would suggest getting it. I have been reading John Green since his first book, and I've never been disappointed. He is a powerful writer, with the ability to cram so much life into a relatively small book. For me, it was a piece of fiction, that was a slice of a little-known-reality, and for that I say thank you.

B000ICL3C4|4.0|The cd was in excellent condition as well as the liner notes. And I love this album. It's the Cure at their most quirky, dark, and psychedelic. Perhaps more gritty and esoteric than there more popular albums, it is to me one of their most strange, interesting, varied collection of songs. From sweet bubblegummy songs, to skull popping aggression and darkness.  There are a couple slower dirgey tracks that can feel claustrophobic and suffocating, but I find them still effective and interesting. I like the vibe of this whole album, it has a real 'punch' to it.

0385342063|5.0|I'll admit - I'm a huge Sophie Kinsella fan.  And while I love the Shopaholic series, it's her stand alone novels that I really enjoy the most, and this one was no exception.<br /><br />If you're already a fan of Kinsella's writing, you'll know what to expect - a fluffy story, full of laugh out loud moments.  In this book, we meet Poppy Wyatt.  She's engaged to be married and wouldn't you know, she lost her engagement ring.  To make matters worse, her cell phone gets stolen as well.  Somehow, she stumbles across an abandoned cell phone in a trash bin, and so starts this fun story that I didn't want to put down.  Sure, Poppy can be a little ditzy and a little bit of a pushover, but I really enjoyed the story and would rank it as one of my favorite Kinsella novels to date (along with Twenties Girl, Remember Me, and Undomestic Goddess).  There are quite a few twists and turns, and while the ending didn't really keep me guessing, the journey was what made the story so enjoyable.<br /><br />I tried as hard as possible to read this one slowly and really savor it - because I knew as soon as I finished, I would have to wait ages for another Kinsella novel.  It's not going to win any literary achievement awards, but it's a perfect feel-good book for light reading.

1451648537|4.0|A life with goals  Review of Isaacson's Steve Jobs by Paul F. Ross   Quickly atop the Wall Street Journal's list of nonfiction best sellers, this biography by Walter Isaacson was invited by Jobs himself, was written without Jobs himself having read it or having requested  _____________________________________________________________________________________  Isaacson, Walter  Steve Jobs  2011, Simon & Schuster, New York NY, xxi + 630 pages  _____________________________________________________________________________________  permission to read it, and was published on 24 October 2011.  Steve Jobs was born 24 Feb 1955 and died 5 October 2011, aged 56.  Jobs resigned from his position as CEO of Apple Computer Company on 24 August 2011.  Isaacson reports that both Jobs himself and his wife encouraged Isaacson to describe Jobs' life as it was.   Given for adoption by his unwed mother, Jobs was raised by Paul and Clara Jobs from their home in Los Altos CA, Paul Jobs making his livelihood as a rebuilder of cars.  Paul and Clara Jobs recognized Steve's high level of ability and were devoted parents to him.  In high school, Steve Jobs took an electronics class with John McCollum that, like others of McCollum's students, captured Steve's interests.  Following that class, Steve met an earlier graduate of the class, Stephen \\"Woz\\" Wozniak and, together in about 1971, they enjoyed using a device that Woz had designed and built that allowed them to make telephone calls anywhere over the AT&T network for no charge.  The teaming continued.  In 1976 The Apple I (Woz' design, Jobs' sales and marketing push) was displayed at an Atlantic City computer fair.  Jobs was 21 and his career was launched.  By that time he had already attended Reed College for a year, dropped out, followed a Zen Buddhist leader in India, experimented with drugs, fathered a daughter.  Apple Computer Company went public in December 1980.  Jobs was 25.  He was wealthy.  Dismissed at Apple by its Board in 1985, hecreated the NeXt computer company in about 1986, bought into Pixar in 1986, and was involved in Pixar even after his return to Apple in 1997.  Jobs married Laurene Powell 18 March 1991.  He located his birth mother, reconnected with his daughter Lisa, fathered Reed and Erin with Laurene ... all traced by biographer Isaacson.  Jobs' career achievements at Apple and at Pixar are described with care.  Jobs' rough edges are described.   The work reads very easily.  Isaacson takes a complex story line, a complexity found in everyone's life, and describes it in chapter segments which attend to different aspects of Jobs' life.  While viewing Jobs with some objectivity and bringing to the story the viewpoints of many actors in Jobs' life, Isaacson is an admirer of Jobs ... not a distant analyst.  Having published the biography mere days after Jobs' death, the work has no opportunity to see Jobs' career and the work at Apple and Pixar as they play out in the longer tale of history.  It is this reader's sense that Isaacson has a limited appreciation for the role of software and hardware, the role of competition in the development of the computer industry, and the role of many individuals in an organization in generating an organization's success.  Isaacson's is a story of \\"what Apple did\\" particularly as a consequence of Jobs' inputs.  Isaacson, like the buyers of corporate stock in the stock market, sees an organization's performance as the consequence of the input of one individual ... a view that cannot possibly be true.  But his biography is interesting and certainly reports details available now that might disappear from memory and history if not recorded now.  This reviewer should add that he himself was an early user of IBM \\"big iron,\\"  has been a fan of IBM-PC-clones and their history, worked a decade at Digital Equipment Corporation, thus does not qualify as an Apple fan although he has offspring and grandchildren who do.  The reviewer finds the Apple iPad a lovelyitem to admire.  The reviewer's wife walks daily to Apple's Shuffle entertainment.  He is startled by the number of drops-to-the-floor the Apple iPhones (owned by others) survive, sees Googling a query on one's cell phone during a luncheon conversation as something approaching an uncouth intrusion.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|4.6 stars<br /><br />Why is HBO so far beyond its competitors? They keep on making cinema-quality series while the other networks make pure drivel. Game Of Thrones is quite simply, like The Sopranos, The Wire and so many other HBO shows, in another class altogether from what's on TV.<br /><br />HBO is tailor-made for folks like me who avoid TV and grab the pick of the litter when it comes out on dvd. Or in this case blu-ray, which is perfect for such a lush production as GOT. Everything here is top-notch, while focusing on character above all (though never sacrificing huge sets and epic landscapes). Martin's books do, and that's why this is such a fine choice for adaptation: drama and lots of it. There's plenty of slash and hack for action fans (and be warned, there's some very graphic stuff, but less sensational violence and more brutally real), yet the real focus is on relationships, and the fine acting makes it work.<br /><br />There's not a duff performance in the bunch, and some real winners, above all Dinklage and Gillen, who as in The Wire plays a morally-challenged political weasel to perfection. Dinklage has a small part, but works it to the hilt (as in the original Death At A Funeral, such a great film). There are myriad plot lines here, and the excellent casting makes it all work. Harrington and Bean are two other standouts.<br /><br />The pacing of this first season is truly impressive, as is the credit the viewer is given for having some brains. Many things are hinted at rather than spoonfed to us, and it involves us to a much greater and more satisfying extent. Plus, in a rare twist, the series is very true to the books, and some of it is even written by Martin. Respect for the author's vision! What a novel concept...<br /><br />Above all, I like that they didn't try to make Lord Of The Rings again (HB RR O)---this is fantasy but it's more concerned with people than mythical creatures, and that keeps it always compelling. If they keep this series at this level it will go down with The Sopranos and The Wire as one of the best tv series ever made.<br /><br />{Edit: 4/12/12. Well that won't be the case judging from the first few episodes of season two. Looks like killing off your best actor and character ain't a very good idea. This new season just feels more Hollywood than the first so far. Too bad.]is level it will go down with The Sopranos and The Wire as one of the best tv series ever made.<br /><br />{Edit: 4/12/12.

1455502626|3.0|This is my second DeMille book, the Lions Game was the first and did enjoy it.  This book I did not enjoy as much.  The John Corey character is a cross between Det. Axel Foley (Beverly Hills Cop)and Jake Gittens (Chinatown) but to an extreme and way way overdone.  Corey actually become annoying as the book develops.  I picked up the book since I have interest in Plum Island hoping for a biological/terrorist thriller, I got neither.  I won't reveal the plot but after 650 pages or so it was very dissapointing, like big deal. The book is your typically who done it page turner and goes very fast (good thing).  I doubt if I will read another DeMille book again.

B0068RHGJM|5.0|First off, pay no heed to the reviewers who give this disc one star. They are fans of the original vocalist of Nightwish and are still bitter that the band has moved on without her. Every successful band has a segment of fans who embrace an album or two and wish everything else were carbon copies (i.e., \\"Metallica fan who wishes every album was just like \\"Master of Puppets\\"). Nightwish was majestic when Tarja was lead vocalist, and they are equally majestic with Anette at the helm. Two different vocal styles- Tarja was more operatic with her vocals, while Anette is more theatrical and dramatic. Musically and vocally, the album is simply too good (and intelligent) to give it a one-star review, and those \\"fans\\" probably had their minds set to hate the CD long before they even heard it. Maybe all the one-star reviews are by Tarja's relatives...   Of their seven albums, \\"Imaginaerum\\" is Nightwish's Opus (my previous favorite was \\"Once\\"). \\"Imaginaerum\\" is epic in every sense of the word. It is a concept album about a delusional composer who looks back over his his life as he lies dying: it's about the inevitable journey of the spirit upon death, the battle between God & Devil for the eternal soul- set in a macabre, 'Alice In Wonderland-esque' carnival world (at least that's what I get out of it, others may interpret it differently).  The CD actually infuses so many genres: classical, theatrical, sultry jazz, Celtic, metal, opera... Such a seamless blend of differing genres (complete with full orchestra; strings, horns and even bagpipes- and adult & child choirs) really demonstrates the brilliance of their musicianship. This is a CD for people who enjoy multiple music styles and can appreciate the magnitude it takes to successfully pull all of them together. For example, \\"Ghost River\\" is a heavy song (musically and lyrically)that infuses the conflicting guttural/demonic and angelic vocals (like the forces of good and evil trying to sway the storyteller's soul to their side) along with a child's choir that together attribute to the overall foreboding and \\"creepiness\\" of the tune. Very atmospheric stuff. Then the very next song (\\"Slow, Love, Slow\\")REALLY changes things up by incorporating an incredibly wonderful jazzy sound to it that makes the listener feel like they're back in the 1930's, sipping whiskey at a speakeasy. Some reviewers have complained just how out of place the song feels, but I think it all comes together wonderfully. It's probably one of my favorites on the disc. \\"Turn Loose the Mermaids\\" has a terrific Celtic element to it that changes everything up yet again. Every song is completely unique unto itself. \\"Last Ride of the Day\\" is old school Nightwish, complete with heavy and catchy riffs. Then there's \\"I Want My Tears Back,\\" an amazing track that fuses old school metal with Scottish ceilidh (kayliegh) music throughout. Only a lover of multiple musical tastes can appreciate such a celebration of differing genres brought together.   Standout tracks: just about every one, really. There's not a track I don't find mesmerizing one way or another. If I had to pick one, \\"Scaretale\\" is worthy of its own review: the song is so strange and different from anything I've ever heard on a rock / metal album, but in an absolutely terrific way. The vocals are so dramatically deranged and mad that as a listener you can't help feeling like you've just been sucked into a nightmarish rabbit hole. The accompanying score makes me think of a carnival or circus in hell, complete with demonic clowns and dead children. Dark stuff, but brilliant.  This CD is nothing short of brilliant and one of the few I enjoy every single track (along with 2011's \\"Unforgiving\\" by Within Temptation- also highly recommended). I can see this disc may not be for everyone, although one-star reviews by fans of \\"old\\" Nightwish are simply unwarranted. One-star reviews should be left for the hordes of unimaginative, cookie-cutter crap that completely pollute the airwaves of mainstream radio nowadays. Most of all, the music and story are so illustrative and picturesque that as a listener you can't help but use your own imagination to visualize the fantasy world created by this CD. That is the sign of intelligent and magnificent musicianship.

B006O5XYWG|5.0|I love this movie, I love all of the scientific research that was put into the making of this movie - extensive studies on apes, in particular, chimpanzees - which apes are NOT monkies, like people stupidly always call them.  Monkies aren't as intelligent, or related to humans at all, and they have a long tail!  Apes share a common ancestor that spilt from humans about 2-4 million years ago (these facts aren't in the movie, but I figured that anyone who watches this movie would become a huge fan of apes afterwards).<br /><br />Evolution has proven that apes and humans share a common ancestor, and evolution has evolved mankind to be the most intelligent of the animal kingdom - however, apes have proven (not only by DNA) that they possess the same intelligence - even in reality, apes can be taught to sign, to use its fingers, walk upright, laugh, cry, show emotions, pass memory tests, and even build tools (a chimp was the first mammal to the moon, even before humans, when the USA launched a chimp to space in the '60s) - something that humans had only thought they could do.  These are FACTS, and I thought the viewer might like to know these facts because if you understand the relations of apes and humans better, it makes the movie that much greater.<br /><br />The scenes are beautiful shots, especially the woodland parts that shows them high up top tress with a pan view of the San Francisco skyline of the bridge and everything.  James Franco is very believable as a humane scientist, although I do think he was a bit young to play the part, but still delivered an excellent performance as Caesar's adoptive father.  Of course, the best actor of the movie was Caesar, who is played by Andy Serkis - for those of you who don't know who he is, he played that ugly Gollum hobbit in the Lord of the Rings movies.  He is wonderful as a motion actor for these computerized characters that he plays, his facial impressions are amazing.<br /><br />I won't tell the plot of the story (you can Wikipedia the movie article for that!) - but this is a great box office hit!  I never like sci-fi, I didn't care for any of the Star Wars movies or Star Trek, or Transformers or anything - but this one actually made me cry half-way through the movie.<br /><br />I gave this movie five stars because I loved it so much, but really you should buy the DVD or Blu-ray, because even though I bought the Instant Video of it - it doesn't come with any extras, which I was a bit disappointed about, and you don't get options for subtitles or anything; I mean, I suppose it's okay if you just want to see the movie, seeing as how the Instant Video is less money than the DVD or Blu-ray, even if you buy it.<br /><br />I highly recommend.can Wikipedia the movie article for that!) - but this is a great box office hit!

B0063IH60K|4.0|this game is really fun. great to play when you're bored. it can keep you entertained for a long time.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I have used a few of these, and presently use 2; one for GPS routing in a vehicle, and one for GPS location on foot. These are excellent GPS receivers for the price, and very easy to setup. Though you do not need proper \\"drivers\\", I suggest using the included driver to simplify usage.  HARDWARE SETTINGS (in case you need to tell your software what to use):  4800 Baud  8 Bit  No parity  1 Stop bit  AKA 4800 8N1  PROS:  * Excellent CarPC GPS solution  * Plug and play, you'll be up and running right out of the box  * Needs no drives, but does include some basic software and drivers just in case  * Fast satellite acquisition - typically has a full 3d lock before I can load the software  * Fast reacquisition - for when you go in a tunnel or whatnot, it only takes a couple of seconds to regain the lock  * 100% Compatibility with software and hardware - it's USB, just plug it up, tell your system what com port it's on  OTHER THOUGHTS:  * Sometimes you will want to share the signal between several programs, and there is a free software solution for this called Curiostech Xport. Search for it online. It will enable you to share this GPS receiver, creating between 1 or 128 ports, however many you need. It also allows you to easily specify certain com ports for it to be used on, rather than going through the Device Manager. It is frequently coupled with this receiver for CarPC and Computer builds.  * You don't need true \\"line of sight\\" for these to work, IE you don't HAVE to put it on your roof or dashboard, it can be hidden under something like plastic or carpetting, AS LONG AS it's not being covered by metal. I usually install these under the dashboard plastic, so the radio signal can go through the glass/plastic and to the puck, or in the rear-deck of the vehicle, where the speakers are. Just don't mount it under metal.

0439023483|2.0|Maybe I just read too much sci-fi. Maybe, as an adult, I've outgrown adolescent fiction. Maybe the distopian worlds of 1984, Animal Farm, and Fahrenheit 451 outshine this book so much I'm failing to notice its strong suits, but I honestly have no clue why everyone loves this book.  As I continually rolled my eyes at heavy handed sentences, droll characters, and implausible circumstances I held out for a plot twist that would finally validate the hoorah I'd been earing about this book. In the end, I was sadly disappointed.  It's not that there aren't moments I enjoyed the book, but I found most of it stale, unoriginal, overdone. The \\"battle royalle\\" is not a new concept. Although it's typically no more than a shoot-em up, thoughtless plot I've already seen the previews for Deathrace, Smokin' Aces, Gamer, and many other of their like. I haven't seen one of them because this isn't a plot I associate with quality. For whatever reason I thought The Hunger Games would be different.  I found myself wishing for more action sequences...it seems our protagonist makes her way to the top ranks of The Hunger Games more through luck than battle prowess. I rolled my eyes at her strategy, at the unlikeliness of the allegiances formed (particularly the four strongest allying against the non-threats). I found some survival tactics used completely wrong...particularly cutting a hole in the side of a thermal sleeping bag. Oh and let's not forget that she manages to get her hands on a pair of night vision goggles, but still only hunts (both game and contenders) in the day.  The only part of this that interested me was the world Collins has created, but even that was sparsely seasoned compared to the rich world of 1984 or the decadent allegory of Animal Farm. In the end, The Hunger Games only teased my appetite for literature or more sustenance, and more spice.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|Pinocchio ranks second on my list of personal favorite Disney feature animations behind Peter Pan and it's one of those stories that will forever be indelibly associated with the world famous studio. This one is a true cinematic fairy tale and like many old fairly tales has a very dark undercurrent. Pinocchio was the second feature length animation from Disney arriving in theaters in early 1940 following Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs but it doesn't feel dated in the least thanks to a complete lack of pop references. Despite Disney having very little competition in the way of animation studios at the time it's clear that they challenged themselves to produce some of the most stunning visuals ever. The movements are fluid and the backgrounds are wonderful with the classic Italian village architecture. It has the feel of something crafted by true artistic masters.<br /><br />Pinocchio is a film that moves at its own pace and one of the reasons Peter Pan ranks higher for me is that it keeps things moving briskly. On the other hand Pinocchio's deliberate pace allows the viewer to really take in the atmosphere. It's nearly a half hour before Pinocchio even leaves Geppetto's workshop but what an amazing workshop it is. The animators are justifiably proud of the work they did in designing the workshop including the dozens of cuckoo clocks and music boxes. Even Geppetto wooden bed is marvelously intricate. This is a very immersive movie but it avoids being ponderous. I'd always thought of Pinocchio as being a rather short movie but at 88 minutes it's actually one of the longest Disney feature animations.<br /><br />The best part of Pinocchio is Pinocchio himself. The little wooden boy has the naivety of someone born yesterday because he literally was born yesterday. Minutes after being given life he's delighted when his finger lights on fire while playing with a candle. Even as Geppetto rushes around his workshop to find something to extinguish the flame the grin of wonder never leaves Pinocchio's face. When Pinocchio is freed from the clutches of evil puppet master Stromboli Jiminy Cricket grimly utters, `goodbye, Stromboli', while the villains wagon rides off. Pinocchio responds by waving and cheerfully yelling, `GOODBYE, STROMBOLI!!!' before Jiminy can hush him. There is not a shred of malice in Pinocchio although his ignorance takes a dark turn when he's seduced into some very destructive behavior that nearly leads to his end.<br /><br />I would like to say that is a film suitable for children of all ages but the truth is there are some really disturbing images. Monstro the whale can be frightening but the truly horrific character is `The Coachman' who has to go down as one of the all time most sinister beings in cinematic history. The entire Pleasure Island section is a nightmare of childish self indulgence which features among other things children smoking cigars. I watched this film when I was a child and I don't think it scarred me but I definitely remembered its darkness. I might suggest a child be at least 7 and maybe even a little older. What `The Coachman' does to the children can definitely inspire some bad dreams in kids. The darkness of the movie is not a complaint it's just a reality. From the animation to the songs to the story and voice acting this movie is near perfection. If you have a Disney collection Pinocchio is a must.never leaves Pinocchio's face.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|well this is the first season of this series and it is a bit fast paced.  the story moves quickly through a lot of characters, but it was still very addicting to watch and the storyline was great.  the second season is a bit slower with the plot, but the storyline has gotten better and more in depth with the characters.  GREAT SHOW to watch!!!!

0307592731|5.0|\\"Foot speed was a profoundly different way of moving through the world than my normal ways of travel.  Miles weren't things that blazed dully past.  They were long, intimate straggles of weeds and clumps of dirt, blades of grass and flowers that bent in the wind, trees that lumbered and screeched. They were the sound of my breath and my feet hitting the trail one step at a time and the click of my ski pole.  The PCT had taught me what a mile was.  I was humble before each and every one.\\"<br /><br />I've never started a review with a quote before - but this one just spoke to me so deeply that I knew I couldn't begin any other way.  I am a runner, not a hiker, but the feeling is the same.  In \\"wild\\" by Cheryl Strayed, she takes on the unbelievable quest to hike the Pacific Crest Trail.  I've NEVER come CLOSE to that sort of physical and mental challenge, but there have been some longer runs where each step seems impossible - and even more impossible is the fact that there are so many more to take.<br /><br />The journey detailed in this book was completely engrossing.  From the details of her life and the events that led Strayed to choose this path (the scene where she learns her mother has died reads like a punch in the gut) to the description of what she experienced and felt while on this 1100 mile solo hike, this book sucked me in.<br /><br />\\"Within forty minutes, the voice inside my head was screaming, \\"What have I gotten myself into?\\"  I tried to ignore it, to hum as I hiked, though humming proved too difficult to do while panting and moaning in agony and trying to remain hunched in that remotely upright position while also propelling myself forward when I felt like a building with legs.\\"<br /><br />So much of what she thought about her life, herself, her readiness for this journey, turns out to be much more and less than she imagined.  Unable to find a path forward in the life she has known, she chooses a completely different path instead.  Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail alone proves to be the ultimate physical, mental and emotional challenge.  A hike that seems like it would be governed by mostly external forces turns out to be an internal struggle the likes of which few of us will ever experience.<br /><br />\\"Before I began hiking the PCT, I'd imagined that I'd sleep inside my tent only when it threatened to rain, that most nights I'd lay my sleeping bag on top of my tarp and sleep beneath the stars, but about this, like so much else, I'd been wrong.  Each evening, I ached for the shelter of my tent, for the smallest sense that something was shielding me from the entire rest of the world, keeping me safe not from danger, but from vastness itself.\\"<br /><br />Strayed takes the months long trip to fully confront the grief and losses she'd experienced.  The biggest one, and the catalyst for the others, was the death of her mother.  Four years after the fact, she still tries to grapple with her feelings.<br /><br />\\"One of the worst things about losing my mother at the age I did was how very much there was to regret.  Small things that stung now:  all the times I'd scorned her kindness by rolling my eyes or physically recoiling in response to her touch; the time I'd said, \\"Aren't you amazed to see how much more sophisticated I am at twenty-one than you were?\\"  The thought of my youthful lack of humility made me nauseous now.\\"<br /><br />Most adult daughters can look back on similar things they've said to their mothers.  But most adult daughters get the time and perspective they need to make up for that, for them to acknowledge that \\"youthful lack of humility\\".  But Strayed's mother died when they were both too young.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed shares much more with the reader than the path she followed from the Mojave Desert to Washington State.  She shares every part of herself...so much so that when she finally arrives at The Bridge of the Gods, it was all I could do not to cheer aloud.<br /><br />\\"I had arrived.  I'd doneit.  It seemed like such a small thing and such a tremendous thing all at once, like a secret I'd always tell myself, though I didn't know the meaning of it just yet.\\"<br /><br />I am profoundly glad she chose to share that secret with the world.  Without walking the 1100 miles in her boots, I feel as if I made the journey with her.always tell myself, though I didn't know the meaning of it just yet.\\"  I am profoundly glad she chose to share that secret with the world.

B000TENMBG|3.0|Ablaze with glory, Daniel Barenboim sat regally in the back of his limousine as its rolled down the Champs Elysees. He was alone. Much to his dismay, the function had ended late. What had it been? A Mozart concerto? A Beethoven piano recital? Or perhaps a Bruckner symphony? He could no longer remember as he sipped away on his 1975 Veuve Clicquot. Still, the bottom-line had undoubtedly improved. Exhaustion was in floodtide and his accountants awaited him in the morning. For a moment the septuagenarian thought he could hear a snatch of the Elgar Cello Concerto but it was soon drowned out by the blare of traffic.<br /><br />All of a sudden, a voice addressed him vehemently in German.<br /><br />\\"Daniel, Daniel - why are you persecuting me?\\"<br /><br />Barenboim stared at the bottle of champagne and then smelt its neck: there was nothing awry.<br /><br />\\"Daniel, Daniel - why are you persecuting me?\\"<br /><br />An unearthly light bathed the interior of the limousine. Barenboim blinked. Sitting opposite him was the ghost of Wilhelm Furtwangler.<br /><br />\\"Maestro - welcome! It's good to see you after all this time! But why are you saying such a thing? I'm your most dedicated advocate!\\"<br /><br />Furtwangler's brow was more furrowed than a wheat field.<br /><br />\\"Drop the niceties, Daniel! Stop trying to recreate my conducting style! Let me rest in peace! I can't stand it anymore! It's hateful!\\"<br /><br />\\"But Maestro - it is true. I've studied your recordings ad infinitum. I try to mirror your spontaneity in my approach to any score, as if the work is being composed in the act of performance. I'm flexible with tempi. Do you know that I've won seven Grammy Awards over time?\\"<br /><br />\\"Daniel, how can I put this diplomatically?\\" The ghost paused. \\"You are a solid B-Minus grade conductor. To ape my mastery is one thing; to embody it in depth is another. There are times when you'll ace it on the night as in your Bruckner Ninth with my old orchestra. At other times, you'll be pussy-whipped by that dunce Zubin Mehta. That doesn't sound like mastery to me! And what about all those endless careerist appointments: Opera Bastille, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Berlin State Opera and now La Scala. What have they amounted to? Answer: Mother Hubbard's Cupboard! The ultimate prize will never come your way and we both know that!\\"<br /><br />Furtwangler leaned forward.<br /><br />\\"Take for example, your 1985 performance of the Mozart Requiem. OK, the recording itself is somewhat opaque but Kathleen Battle was at her prime: she is reason in itself to perpetuate this recording; and the bass is no slouch either. The choir - at times - sings with a fervency that is stunning as if their own entrails are on the line. And yet you are unable to elicit anything more than a `coin-in-the-slot' response from the Orchestra de Paris. Isn't that the hallmark of a great conductor - being able to transform an ordinary unit into a world class ensemble, however temporarily? There is no evidence of it here. Nor can one detect an interpretative viewpoint in the Romantic slush. Did you roll up on the day and sight-read the score on the spot? Probably!\\"<br /><br />A grimace appeared on the face of the spectre.<br /><br />\\"Daniel - stop associating your sausage-mill with my good name! What about . . .  Mister . . . Mister . . . Mister K? He needs an acolyte, especially as Big Jim Levine and Ozawa have troubles of their own! Why not adopt him as your lodestar?\\"<br /><br />Barenboim's mobile-phone rang. Its ringtone was the opening motif from the Beethoven Fifth. The intrusion of technology - and its misappropriation of an icon - unsettled the ghost.

B0053KWDES|4.0|Only recently have I been interested in discovering the true sound potential that my music can provide me. It wasn't until I did some research and discovered portable amps and a solid pair of headphones did I realize that I was missing out.<br /><br />Man was I missing out! This amp sounds amazing connected to my ipod classic using a line out dock and paired up with my Audio Technica M50 headphones. It is difficult to explain in further detail how much better the sound is as opposed to using the standard ipod jack but it is painfully obvious. The ipod headphone jack degrades the sound quality. You really have to hear it to believe it, and of course having a solid pair of over ear headphones help. I'm no audiophile and am not familiar with the technical aspects of sound and whatnot, but I know what sounds good!<br /><br />After having used it for the past 3 months, I can honestly say I have become really picky with the way my music sounds. I no longer listen to my ipod without being connected to this amp because listening to degraded audio quality is not enjoyable!<br /><br />I wanted to mention that you can bump up the bass quite a bit when you have this guy plugged in your car stereo with an aux cable. I mean, it's no sub woofer by any means, but it does sound a lot better as opposed to a stock sound system. There's a noticeable difference in bass and you don't have to have a trained ear or be an audiophile to notice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I had to tack off one star because there is no charge and play capability. This is a bummer for me when I'm driving far distances and it's connected to my car stereo. When the battery runs out, I have to go back to using the headphone port or the integrated usb cable in my car which neither sound as good as the amp.<br /><br />Also, the description states \\"The battery provides approximately 10 hours of operation per charge, allowing you to listen all day\\". Mine lasted only about 8 or 9 hours fully charged over night.

030788743X|2.0|This book has an interesting premise:  Dystopian (?) future where people obsess over the 1980's due chiefly to a potentially large financial payoff.  That's about all that is good about the novel.  The writing is terrible: references are presented clumsily in page-long lists,  dialogue between the paper-thin characters is painful to read, the main character has virtually no flaws, and there are more plot holes than in the Back to the Future trilogy.  Tension might have developed in the plot, but it becomes clear pretty early on that the main character is perfect.  He's understanding, tolerant, omniscient, etc.  The antagonist changes to meet the needs to the plot, which is to say whatever makes the main character seem most sympathetic.    This just isn't a good book.  Not even a decent book.  It reads more like wish-fulfillment fan fiction of the worst kind.  Skip it and go watch a ton of TV instead.  Maybe in 20 years some idiot savant will start some early-2000's contest in which you yourself can win money, fame, and the girl.

0062060554|4.0|I had a good friend recommend \\"Before I Go to Sleep\\" about eight months ago, yet for some inexplicable reason it took me until now to finally get around to reading it. I am glad I read this one early in 2012, to help kick start the year.In the opening pages, I was worried this would be a more serious version of the Adam Sandlee/Drew Barrymore flick - Fifty First Dates. While I loved the movie, and the general idea I wasn't thrilled at the idea of a full book.<br /><br /> Luckily, it's not long before Christine begins reading her journal and I was sucked in. I would have been content to just stick with that storyline. Again? I was pleasantly surprised. This book was full of twists and turns, the suspense was excellent. I wa reminded how much fun it is to try so hard to find out who did it. This book was not at all predictable, and I loved it!<br /><br />Christine was a wonderful character, her personality flaws (memory aside) were believable. I loved that she wasn't perfect, that her skeletons were buried deep. And of course, the idea of such a traumatic memory loss is terrifying in itself, especially as a mother. What would happen to my child? My heart breaks with just the thought.<br /><br />The first person narrative is superp. I really felt as though I was looking through Chris' eyes and her emotions became my own. I think her reding from a journal made the descriptions that much more vivid.<br /><br />Before I Go To Sleep has spent a long time on the best seller list for a reason, and if you are looking for a good psychological suspense? I suggest you grab this one!

B003OTLVAW|5.0|Cheap? No. Stunning? Yes! This has been one of my all-time favorite albums since it came out. Not sure why some folks  might have had poor quality pressings here, but the SHM-SACD is dead quiet. And the dynamics are excellent. Layers in the bass, and the micro-dynamics of the arious vocals and drumwork are sweet. I played this through an Oppo BDP-95, Decware Ultra preamp, Decware Torii Mk III, and Decware ERR speakers. In stereo, it is just outstanding. Using the Ultra's down/up-mixing capabilities, I can actually hear it in surround. Either way, it is impressive.

B001992NW4|1.0|I was astounded / offended when I heard this idiot refer to Gonzalo Gavira -the sound effects creator- as a \\"Mexican peasant with no shoes\\" in the accompanying documentary 'The Fear of God'.  Mr. Gavira -to whom much of the film's success is owned- worked in more than 100 films both in Mexico and abroad up until 2004, less than a year before his untimely death, and `The Exorcist' is just one more example of his brilliant talents as an artist (in fact, sound effects are known in the Mexican trade as \\"Gaviras\\", in honor of his creativity).  And FYI Friedkin: most foley artists work without shoes for fear of ruining their recordings with the unnecessary sounds of footsteps, as they have to move around the studio all the time while working, so it should be no surprise to a professional like you say you are, but referring to him as \\"a Mexican peasant with no shoes\\" really has no excuse, as damaging and offensive as the 15 seconds deleted from Disney's \\"Fantasia\\" (Warner Bros., take note).  I am definitely throwing this movie in the garbage can.

There's lots of drama in this one, and the effect of the swaggering bad guys wearing long dusters set the scene for the finale. Clint is getting a little \\"long-in-the tooth\\" and wrinkled,  but still believeable as the good avenger/preacher/shootist.  A very entertaining yarn!

B001HN6918|4.0|A good film but nowhere near as good as the first one. There's an attempt to give Po, the main character voiced by Jack Black, more of an inner hero's journey as he tries to seek out his parents and where he came from and while that happens to a certain extent he's more involved with his allies in stopping an evil peacock (voice of Gary Oldman) who is set on eliminating Kung Fu with *gasp* gunpowder. Jeepers! What's going to happen? Adults know what's coming and kids will love it so even though it's predictable in a lot of places it's all in good fun. There are a cast of voices adding their personalities to computer animated characters: Angelina Jolie, Dennis Haysbert, Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Michelle Yeoh, Seth Rogen and Lucy Liu. Why, there's even old martial arts somewhat famous actor Jean Claud Van Damme (Damme strong, Damme proud, Damme right!). A predictable ending with a bit of a cliffhanger that opens it up for Kung Fu Panda 3. This film will have a number of spinoffs and the like with three other films in the franchise and a video game that came out in May 2011. The budget was $150M but the Worldwide Box Office yield was a whopping $665M. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; HUMOR: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; HEROIC THEMES: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid December 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B minus (higher for kids).
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Although this biography was well-written and had a lot of great anecdotes that painted a vivid picture of Steve Jobs, I was disappointed by the lack-luster ending.  It was almost as if Isaacson sped through the final stages of the book in order to get it out right after Jobs' death.  I'm a big biography fan, in particular I really enjoyed works by David Mcullough and Ron Chernow. At the end of their books I was left feeling sentimental about the person I had just read about.  In this books case it was not so - it had the potential to be but I believe that the author didn't cover Jobs' last moments - which are typically the most intimate and revealing moments of a persons life.  This is just my opinion, but I believe that the end was rushed and could have ended in a spectacular fashion, but failed to evoke any emotional responses from the reader.
B003K16P3M|4.0|I had never heard of this book or author until Kindle had this on their Facebook page as a $.99 deal of the day. After reading the comments of those that had read it, I figured to try it as well.  I was really glad I did.  For those that have read the Hunger Games series (awesome reads), the lead woman/her adventures had a feel like the Hunger Games had.  Strong woman character, even the names are similar Katsa in this book/Katniss in Hunger Games.  It's also set in a fictional setting that is unlike anything we know.  Yet it didn't come off as a rip off or copy.    The characters are enjoyable to read, the storyline is engaging and the author writes in a way that keeps the story moving along nicely.  I loved the concept that people have \\"graces\\" that give them special powers.  It makes for interesting predicaments and characters.  There was one time that the story got a tad sluggish but it wasn't so bad that I didn't want to read.  I found myself wanting to read this book, not just as a pre-bed routine.  That's always a sign I have a good book going.  I would have paid the full price for this book. And I will definitely read the other books this author has, one of which is a prequel to this book (Fire).    Definitely give this one a try.

B004N66XYE|4.0|The year is 1936.  It's been several years since the Bellamy family were forced to sell their beloved 165 in Eaton Place.  The house has remained empty, a shadow of its former self.  But not for long...<br /><br />Returning from an extended stay in America, diplomat Sir Hallam Holland (Ed Stoppard) and his wife Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes) assume ownership of the property, with the intention of using it as their ticket into London's innermost social circle;  but the pair doesn't count on the arrival from India of Hallam's delightfully eccentric mother, Maud (Eileen Atkins), her secretary Mr Amanjit (Art Malik), and a mischevious monkey, who applauds Maud when she first opens her eyes each morning.  Lady Agnes' younger sister Lady Persie (Claire Foy), an unkempt debutante with an unpredictable wilful streak, later completes the new family.<br /><br />In desperate need to assemble a team of servants truly capable of what comes with the territory at Eaton Place, Lady Agnes drops into \\"Buck's of Belgravia\\", run by none other than 165's faithful former house parlourmaid, Rose (Jean Marsh).  The lure of revisting her beloved days at the Bellamy mansion proves too great, and Rose dedicates her time to making sure that the servants employed there are the best people for the job - and the price offered by Lady Agnes.  Soon, Rose has recruited social-climbing cook Mrs Thackeray (Anne Reid), sparky maid Ivy (Ellie Kendrick),  chauffeur Harry Spargo (Neil Jackson), and footman Johnny Proude (Nico Mirallegro); however it's the position of butler which causes Rose the most sleepless nights.  The shadow of Hudson looms large in Rose's estimation, and each applicant seems to come up short.  Finally Rose pounces upon Mr Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough), a veteran of the Cunard cruiseships, and an exacting personality who keeps the others firmly under control.<br /><br />The house is alive again, upstairs and downstairs, but the stormy political situation developing around the possible abdication of the King, the uprising of Oswald Mosely's British Fascist movement; and a scandalous secret at the heart of the Holland family, will create a ripple of drama that will be felt by each and every member of 165 Eaton Place.<br /><br />With more than a reverential nod to the original series, writer Heidi Thomas has created a worthy follow-up in this new BBC incarnation (which can technically be referred-to as Series 6 of \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\").  It's fabulous to finally have Dame Eileen Atkins on the set (she was, along with co-star Jean Marsh, one of the brains behind the original series and as such would have played Sarah--the Pauline Collins role--but decided to instead concentrate her career on the stage).  It's a sheer treat to have her as the stately yet remarkably earthy Maud, one of the best new characters.<br /><br />Jean Marsh - what can I say?  She is the living embodiment of the original series and it would have been a crime to not have included her in some form.  Fans of the original will cheer and probably shed a tear or two when they see Rose once again on that classic Eaton Place staircase (which is bigger than before but still close enough to resemble the original).  Come to think of it, everything's bigger and slicker in this new series (after over 30 years that's to be expected), but there's still a strong connection to the simple, yet powerful charm of the classic series, and as before it's the real-life political and sociological events of the times which propel most of the drama within the episodes.<br /><br />The only disappointment?

B005URRCUY|5.0|(Taken from my blog at [...])<br /><br />Following their mainstream breakthrough \\"Brothers\\", the Black Keys return with what I truly believe is their strongest set of songs. Although \\"Brothers\\" was a fantastic record, the ideas were a tad bit too stretched out and the pacing was off in certain parts. Producer Dangermouse handled the duties on \\"El Camino\\" and it helps bring the best out of this duo. Things are wound tighter than a guitar string, with just enough space to breathe for what is only absolutely necessary. It's never suffocating though and the result is a laser focused piece that has all of the fat cut off.<br /><br />What you are given is Dan's ever-improving vocals and Patrick's frantically shifting drum patterns. This album never bores, never lets you down and never lets you go. It holds you but allows you to groove, dance, and get your mojo on. It's funky, it's bluesy, it's a bit raw in places but more than anything, it's a high achievement, a record that sounds more effortless than anything they've done before and yet, sounds difficult to accomplish within the same moment.

B0050I2P32|4.0|(Taken from my blog at [...])<br /><br />I will be the first to admit that I pretty much hated the debut album from The Horrors. It felt extremely mediocre to me, noise for the sake of noise and ultimately, nothing interesting to be found. Much to my surprise, they grew exponentially and have shaped their best album to date, \\"Skying\\".<br /><br />They wear their influences on their sleeves, for sure, but they mold them into something new and adventurous. They deftly hop from genre on each track, showing a certain skill of taking a format and turning it inside out. They exhibit patience and a glowing trust in their material which allows them to get creative with the sounds.<br /><br />Phase induced shakers, arpeggiated synths, fuzzed out guitar tones, droning vocals and atmospheric pads are all here to be found. They take you to the sky and they take you back down to the outer regions of a stadium, but never too fast and definitely never too slow.

B005F6NA56|5.0|(Taken from my blog at [...])<br /><br />I was a huge fan of Feist's previous album, the breakthrough \\"The Reminder\\" that came out in 2007. \\"1,2,3,4\\" was everywhere, playing in iTunes commercials and even warranting a guest appearance from Feist herself on Sesame Street. That album has many sunny pop moments, sing-along songs that make you happy to hear them.<br /><br />Which is probably why \\"Metals\\" threw off so many listeners. Not only did we have to wait 4 years for a proper album followup but Feist almost entirely abandoned the same feelings that made her previous album such a breakthrough success. After listening to the record, \\"Metals\\" is a most appropriate album title; it is abrasive, cold, even a bit uninviting. And I loved it all the more for it.<br /><br />There is no \\"1,2,3,4\\" to be found, no \\"I Feel it All\\" or \\"Sea Lion\\". Instead, there is sparse production, stomps, clangs, and percussion that punctures the already-bleak soundscapes. There are no songs that ask \\"tell me that you love me more\\"; instead, you get songs detailing \\"The Bad in Each Other\\". This is an artist who wants you to meet her on her own terms, no matter how depressing or unexpected it may be. And that is what I love most about this record; Leslie Feist went out and simply wanted to make music that pleased her and you can tell. It's unfiltered, unfussy, even a bit in your face. Above all, it's honest. And the music is incredibly good, showcasing her amazing voice as always while throwing in mountains of harmonies chanting refrains together. It's a black abyss that somehow sounds cathartic.

B004GHYCKW|4.0|(Taken from my blog at [...])<br /><br />My favorite thing about this album is the reckless energy on display, a complete disregard for being politically correct. It is truth, as filtered through PJ Harvey's distinct point of view. You can feel the fire from these songs, both from the lyrics and the laissez-faire attitude of the compositions and the quiet destruction it leaves.<br /><br />\\"Death is everywhere\\", she sings. It is not a record of hope exactly but one of a much needed truth for a place she feels gets off way too easily. And she was inspired enough to declare a battle-cry heard around the world for a place she clearly loves so much but at the same time, feels saddened by. It's heartbreaking, but in the most triumphant kind of way.

B005HS00P0|5.0|(Taken from my blog at [...])<br /><br />I have been a fan of M83 for years now and have every single thing they've put out; I say that because, I firmly believe, with full confidence, that this is the best album they have created thus far. It is perfectly sequenced, produced, and written with every song accomplishing its own task, creating it own feel. Altogether, it occupies its own space that it has constructed for itself.<br /><br />From the opening notes of the first song, I got sucked in. Then I got hit with a curveball: Anthony Gonzalez' voice. When I first heard him sing \\"Carry on, carry on!\\" it gave me goosebumps. This man can SING, my God, and he's been hiding it this entire time! He can do low, breathy melodies and then hit the top of the stadium. From the vocal melodies to the intricate harmonies, this man has really outdone himself in this department. Truly something I would never expect from M83.<br /><br />But as the album continues on, it keeps getting better and better. In prior interviews, Anthony Gonzalez described the new album as \\"the most epic thing we've done\\" and constantly talked about the grand, gigantic feel of it all. Of course, my initial reaction was honing in on the fact that the word \\"epic\\" is thrown around like wadded paper balls these days, used to describe everything from the latest episode of \\"My Little Pony\\" to the size of a larger-than-normal pepperoni on a slice of pizza. But then I listened...and folks, this album is epic in every sense of the word. It's grandiose, bigger than life, a bit daunting even. This album engulfs you, makes you insanely happy, makes you want to cry. It's music at its most emotional state while still able to make you dance or rock out here and there. It feels more like a novel to me and will be something I can't wait to revisit again and again.

B004XIQIPQ|5.0|(Taken from my blog at [...])<br /><br />Full disclosure: the Arctic Monkeys are my favorite band. Why? They have everything I like in a band: they fully understand dynamics of music, the lyrics are poetic but not too difficult to understand, they can rock out harder than the rest of them, they can produce ballads better than the best of them, they produce albums at a consistent rate without losing quality, and they feel like guys who could be my best friends. More than all that though, the truth is, I never know what to expect with each album they put out. Each one is distinct and different, each a separate direction they take and explore.<br /><br />With this album, they move further away from the high-school shenanigans of \\"Whatever People Say I Am...\\" and away from the super fast post-punk of \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\". They stay in the more mid-tempo range of their last effort \\"Humbug\\" but have drifted away from the Josh Homme-inflected darkness and move towards a more light affair. This record is more awash in shoegaze-era sentiments and a bit of nostalgia but not too far removed from the snarky playfulness that defines them.<br /><br />There are rockers on this album, for sure (\\"Don't Sit Down Cause I've Moved Your Chair\\", \\"Library Pictures\\") but they seem to matter more than ever. They have constructed an album that not only has a focus, but a purpose. A lot of thought has been put into what the music means to them and what they think it will mean to us. \\"Piledriver Waltz\\" and \\"Love is a Laserquest\\" are among their best songs, not only because of the truth and character that defines them but also due to the structure and writing of the songs. Although the term is bandied about quite a bit when a band puts out their 3rd or 4th album, the Arctic Monkeys have truly matured. But not too mature to forget their trademark snarl.
B000N680VW|2.0|i love this movie my problem is with the quality of the product the case is useless and doesnt hold the disk in place this led to the disk freely thumping around while it was being shipped and is scratched all over it looks like its been used.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|(Taken from my blog at [...])<br /><br />Cut to Bonnaroo 2011, a huge music festival in Manchester, Tennessee that I visit every year. I was in the sea of thousands watching Eminem's set, surprised at not only how good he is live but at how adept his backing band is as well. That's when he threw out a surprise that I was never expecting: he brought Royce da 5'9\\" out on stage to do two songs together. Although I was probably one of the only ones to recognize the significance in the crowd of people most likely muttering \\"Who?\\", I was beyond elated, watching my #1 and #2 favorite rappers getting back together and trading bars as if no bad blood has ever been shed. After they were finished, they announced that they had an EP coming out the FOLLOWING WEEK. I was floating in the clouds at this point.<br /><br />I dashed my hopes down a bit, not wanting to be disappointed. Both rappers put out albums the year before so I expected these songs to be mostly throwaways, tracks that didn't make the cut of previous albums that were collected together. I was completely wrong. From the opening track, these men sound invigorated, furious, playful, and simply at the top of their game. I have never heard so much fire in these guys, they clearly inspire and push one another to outdo the peaks they create for their selves. The beats are far from throwaway material with the album starting off with hard hitting drums and a stuttering tempo, flowing into \\"Fast Lane\\" which has an instant-classic feel to the beat and the hook.<br /><br />This is the real \\"Watch the Throne\\". They aren't concerned with rapping about the life of riches and fame like that particular Jay-Z/Kanye West collaboration, they are actually trying to be the best rappers humanly possible, pushing the bar as high as they can and salivating to break that barrier. It's pure, 100% hip-hop in an era of rap gone pop.

B004MGMJ3E|4.0|(Taken from my blog at [...])<br /><br />Ever since I heard \\"Tomboy\\" was announced, I knew it would be hard to outdo \\"Person Pitch\\", his previous album. Although \\"Tomboy\\" doesn't quite match the level of its predecessor, it comes very close to doing so.<br /><br />What marks this album more than anything to me is the depth of emotion portrayed. There is a looming sense of loss, sadness and emptiness. Not tears, per-se, but perhaps the memories of them. It's a more restricted effort in scope but it accomplishes so much. And it also happens to break away more from the sample-based foundation of his previous album and go into more live-instrumentation territory, as evidenced by \\"Slow Motion\\". In interviews, he mentioned being influenced by Kurt Cobain for this album, which is not a touchstone many would immediately think of when it comes to Panda Bear, but it somehow fits in more ways than one.

B004J4WQ46|5.0|(Taken from my blog at [...])<br /><br />It's hard to believe that the Strokes have been here for a decade now. Has time really passed that quickly? What's even just as startling is the fact that half of that decade was spent waiting on an album; we have not heard any new Strokes music since 2006's \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" which, in my opinion, received some unfair reviews at the time which seemed to point out the obvious: they do not sound like their first albums any longer.<br /><br />It's a shame because most people seem to have such a love, such a nostalgia for those first two albums that it seems to taint any new material these guys can come up with. Which brings me to my next point that may shock some folks: I truly think \\"Angles\\" is the best record they've ever done thus far. Allow me to elaborate.<br /><br />If there is one adjective that people seem to throw at their debut album \\"Is This It\\", it would be \\"cool\\". When the album first came out, I think I probably heard more about their attitude and leather jackets more than I heard about the chugging guitars and muffled drums. People focused more on everything surrounding the music almost more than the music itself. They talked about the New York scene, the new era of garage rock, etc. And as with almost any band that breaks through in the music scene, there is the inevitable backlash.<br /><br />That backlash started around their 3rd album. They changed their sound, they grew up a bit, they started making music that didn't quite seem so \\"cool\\" and carefree. Instead of making music that resonated as being effortless, they made music that sounded like they spent a lot of time on it, that sprawled a bit, that went in each and every direction. And for a band whose cool seemed to ride on this effortlessness, losing that quality turned off a lot of people. But here's the thing: the Strokes never wanted to be cool. They just wanted to play music.<br /><br />Which brings me back to \\"Angles\\". This is the music of a band that has matured so so much, it's incredibly satisfying to see. The guitarists can PLAY, they can shred now instead of just bashing repeating chords and melody lines. Julian's vocals are now upfront and supremely confident, no longer hiding in the mix. Although it's been known how much behind-the-scenes drama occurred (which, ironically, seemed to be what most reviews focused on), to me, it goes unnoticed on the record: they all fit together, pieces of a collective puzzle.<br /><br />To put it simply, the Strokes of 2011 are making music that the Strokes of 2001 would never be able to make. They weren't capable of making \\"Two Kinds of Happiness\\" and I doubt they would have been interested in creating anything like \\"Machu Picchu\\". They've pushed themselves here, even if it required a lot of hard work. It's more powerful than what they were able to do before. It may not be perfect music for smoking cigarettes and wearing leather jackets to, but all in all, it is a brave step forward and simply better crafted music.ly satisfying to see. The guitarists can PLAY, they can shred now instead of just bashing repeating chords and melody lines. Julian's vocals are now upfront and supremely confident, no longer hiding in the mix. Although it's been known how much behind-the-scenes drama occurred (which, ironically, seemed to be what most reviews focused on), to me, it goes unnoticed on the record: they all fit together, pieces of a collective puzzle.

They weren't capable of making \\"Two Kinds of Happiness\\" and I doubt they would have been interested in creating anything like \\"Machu Picchu\\". They've pushed themselves here, even if it required a lot of hard work. It's more powerful than what they were able to do before. It may not be perfect music for smoking cigarettes and wearing leather jackets to, but all in all, it is a brave step forward and simply better crafted music.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is great for being free. it can be a hassle to get points unless you want to pay for them though.
B00505470O|5.0|(Taken from my blog at [...])<br /><br />Like most listeners, I first discovered Washed Out through the EP \\"Life of Leisure\\". I was an instant fan, really warming up to not only the spaced out vocals but also the memory-inducing production Ernest Greene employed. It felt like something familiar, a feeling you had all along but forgot all about.<br /><br />From there, I was eagerly anticipating a full length proper album. I got my first taste when I saw the band live at the Next Big Nashville music festival in 2010. Due to technical difficulties, they only got to play a 30-minute set, which was unfortunate. But they were able to play 2 brand new songs that come off of this album and my expectations where shattered. The songs threw me into a daze, allowing me to shut out all outside forces and connect directly with the mood and melodies. That is a very hard thing to do to me and I had no option but to surrender to it. The songs were that good. My anticipation for this album pretty much exploded at that point.<br /><br />And thankfully, this album did not disappoint. Not only is there more range to the previous sound he established, the songs propel you into a state of bliss. I listened with my head bobbing, eyes closed, the world shut out. \\"Echoes\\" was more of a hard edged trance, \\"Soft\\" made me fall in love with music all over again and \\"You and I\\" gave me chilly goosebumps, making me feel a lot of things that were perhaps buried within myself. All in all, this record opened up a realm, a distant place that perhaps isn't so distant at all.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it has a good setup. i like that it lets you switch from right to left handed. it also helps me waste time or ignore my boyfriend!!!
B004NSULHM|5.0|(Taken from my blog at [...])<br /><br />I have to say, with regards to 2007's \\"In Rainbows\\", I really felt that it was a good record but not a great one. They weren't really doing anything new or different, but more importantly, it just didn't sound fresh, like the entire band was into it 100%. A good listen but not highly memorable.<br /><br />So going into \\"King of Limbs\\", which seemed to be announced almost completely out of nowhere, I kind of had that same expectation: it will be good, but nothing as memorable as say, \\"OK Computer\\". But when the music came on, I instantly thought \\"Who is this?!\\". I had to check my settings to see that the band was indeed Radiohead. They completely did a 180 from \\"In Rainbows\\". As I'm listening, my head starts bobbing, I'm pulled into the loopy grooves and after a few songs, I start to realize: this is amazing!<br /><br />Have they made songs similar to the ones on this album? Sure, but that may not be fair to say about a band who has pretty much tried every single thing they could think of, touched on more styles and experiments that 100 bands could be classified under. But here, they explore so vastly a style that it feels entirely rewarding, a widescreen soundscape that you fly into. It is very much a groove-oriented record, trying to lull you in as opposed to bashing you over the head with crushing chords and volume (which is not necessarily a bad thing). The bass lines are prominent with the shifting drum fills, loops, and patterns being its main partner-in-crime. Thom Yorke does not try to play leader on this one but simply helps push the mood up front, playing a supporting character role this time around. And it all culminates in one cohesive vision, one singular statement by a band that refuses to grow stale. It feels like a somber dream that you're half awake in; listening but also, somehow, partaking in as well.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I've been waitintg for the latest John Green book for sometime now, after having first read all of his other published works.  After reading the two chapter preview on Kindle, I expected to lvoe it as much as his previous writings.  Sadly, this was not the case.  I thought it was almost too fast paced, not leaving me enough time to really connect with the characters.  Also, I think Mr. Green's schtick of overtly wordy teenage characters is growing old.  No teenager is this clever, or this good with words.  Although I do give him props for once writing a book that isn't about a boy being in love with a tragic figure.  Instead, having it being about a girl whose in love with a tragic figure (albeit a girl who is a tragic figure herself).
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's fun for my niece and nephews to play and they seem to like it and it's not hard to figure out either.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Neat concept.  But a lot of the plot seems borrowed from Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  The question is, how can such an advanced race of aliens be mostly unarmed during the fight scenes.  I figure that their bodies are the weapons.  Will I watch this again?  Yes!  Would I recommend this movie?  Yes.  It just seems that there needed to be more original ideas in it and less borrowed.  Great casting.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|well.... most the games are fun but hard to learn and the ads are sooo annoying! please take away the constant ads just put a few
B004FOA84A|5.0|This was a very good game and the graphics were amazing! You definitely had to use your brain a little bit. The only thing I did not like was when you get to the end your kind of like 'That's it??!!' It took about an hour and a half to complete. I would love to see another one come out!
B0063IH60K|4.0|i use it quite a bit. its not over complicated and its a great little game to kill time. have not had any problems.
0071762345|5.0|I recently finished the Likeable Social Media book and I loved it. I am very involved with social media, but this book taught me so much more. I think this book is beneficial to ALL individuals and companies -- everyone will eventually be using social media!
B00008O89K|5.0|The soundtrack for the Conan movie is awesome.  I love it and so glad I could find it on Amazon.  Brings back my childhood.
B003L77G10|5.0|From Boston Legal to LA Law and on and on I grew so tired of lawyer shows and swore after Boston Legal ended that I wouldn't waste my time again. And here I am... but The Good Wife is SO much better than traditional lawyer crap! Not the personal interaction as much as the characters and so on, the fascinating way they integrate political and legal threads, and so on. My husband and I loved this second season even more than the first and I suspect you will also.
630471193X|4.0|How many of us, if blessed suddenly with special powers, like being able to speak a foreign language like a native after reading a dictionary for 20 minutes, do not need sleep but spend our whole time reading whole libraries and remembering every word and detail, and being able to move objects by though alone, would turn suddenly into the world's most giving person. Granted that super-intelligence would probably enhance one's thought processes and thus cause us to banish most selfish thoughts, wouldn't such a person still be tempted once in a while to use those powers for his own gain? Not big gains, but just small ones, like moving the dinner trays and switching on stuff by thought? This movie has none of that, in fact, all Travolta does is going around saving the world!  But the movie does redeem itself by at least having a story that is interesting enough for viewers to want to watch it to its conclusion. Travolta's acting is commendable, and the supporting cast do well enough to maintain interest in the movie. Aside from the fact that is unrealistic, it is a good movie to watch that brings a sense of wonder and intrigue about the world around us. Though the ending was sad, at least it was in agreement with the general mood of the movie, where one cannot always have what one wants.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was good. it keeps you interested. definately a good game to pass the time. it actually challenges you to think out of the box and earn new games.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|If you need a few minutes to get away from it all this flick will do it.  The film does have some story.  It's presented with good camera and special effects.  I'll be watching it again.
0385344325|4.0|This is a thrilling read about Jack Reacher when he was still a military cop and (sort of) following orders. The story centers on a murder in Mississippi in the year 1997. A woman is dead (and others soon follow) and it appears that a soldier at a nearby military base is responsible. But that soldier has a powerful senator for a father and favors are called in.  Reacher is ordered undercover in the town to find out what is going on and to keep the local police in line. Reacher is supposed to just assess the situation and not make waves - but this wouldn't be much of a story if Reacher backed off from finding the truth. So even though he is ordered to be a good soldier, Reacher works to find out the truth no matter where it leads.  He soon links up with the local sheriff, Elizabeth Deveraux, a former military cop who just happens to be drop dead gorgeous (naturally). Soon Reacher is working closely, very closely, with Deveraux. But other forces are at work and Deveraux may be more than she appears to be. As usual, Reacher needs to find the truth and to hell with anyone who gets in his way.  This is vintage Jack Reacher who plows headlong into a full investigation of the underbelly of this small town, its sheriff, and those in the military and politics who want these crimes covered up and hidden. Despite his orders, Reacher only knows one way: straight ahead. And pity anyone who gets in his way.
0385344228|5.0|It must have been my mood, because when I first tried reading this book, I had troubles getting into it. As usual, I put it aside and tried a couple of others. But when I came back to it, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. 421 of them in less than a day.  Andy Barber is a D.A and a fourteen year old boy is found murdered. It doesn't take long for suspicion to fall on his own fourteen year old son, Jacob.  He's suddenly out and his whole family is a pariah. Andy knows his son is innocent, but the D.A. on the case, a former protege of his, plows ahead and into a trial. Andy is co-defense counsel in a tense courtroom and his own family history, that he'd kept hidden from his own family, gets dragged into the light.  Author Landay knows his business in the courtroom scenes. With the exception of the Perry Mason novels, more mystery, I don't usually like this type of book. I'm glad I finally gave it a go.  And a nice twist at the end.  A winner.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is awesome. seriously. you get a ton of games, and unlocking the other games is like a game in itself.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I had seen this movie four times when it was in the movie theaters.  It is a classic with a wonderful story and the best cast of actors who perfect their roles.  Everyone should see it at least once!!!
1594744769|4.0|Great idea to include pictues.  The first part of the book was great, but got somewhat strange toward the end.  Our book club enjoyed this book and enjoyed discussing it at our meeting.
B005I6EVUG|3.0|Just got my Kindle Fire like everybody else on the planet and wanted a case right away to protect it in my handbag.  I looked at a few online and decided on this one because I loved the red color.  It fits the Fire very well.  It's snug but not hard to remove if you so desire.  It does protect the screen in my bag but that is about all it does.  I don't find it very comfortable when I'm holding it to read a book and its especially awkward when I'm trying to view a video and I need to hold it horizontally.  I had to use the Kindle without a case for about a week before this case came in, and I remember it felt better to me without this case on it.  I think this case is actually annoying.  The only reason I'm keeping it on is for protection in my bag so it doesn't get scratched or banged up.  I'm sorry now that I didn't buy one of the cases with a little stand instead.  I don't think it's worth the money...it's pretty expensive for something that doesn't really do a lot.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Includes a lot of games. Not that great of games. Very good if you need something to do.For some reason however,certain antivirus report it as a virus. This includes Dr.web and AVAST antivirus.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|it does have a way to download versions which is good but offline you cannot highlight or anotate within the application. I understand not seeing community information but I did expect at least highlighting.  kindle fire
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very fun. you can play the games, earn points, and buy other games in it. some are challenging, some are not.
0062060554|4.0|A page turner that totally engulfed me into the author's world as the one experiencing the loss of memory....who do I believe and trust...who do I not believe, not trust. One has to pay attention to details but then are they right or wrong...the clues are there but do I believe them or what I want to believe. Well written and suspenseful to the very end. Certainly a book to read \\"before you go to sleep\\".
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this app.  My Kindle Fire is so much easier to take to meetings and I never have to worry about not having the correct files with me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love it. it is everygame I can imagine in one now give me my points for typing this thanks
B005K17RU0|4.0|This seems to be pretty accurate with the actual weather. I just wish it gave a tad bit more details about each day's forecast.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I'm only here because i think if i make a review ill get 250,000 points, but it's probably not going to happen.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun, but a bit hard, but a great app. overall, I loved it, and would reccomend it to a friend.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game offers all kinds of games and it will swallow your time away with this enbless fun I love this game

B002SSBD6W|5.0|This book changed my life. It took everything I knew, or thought I knew, and educated me on a personable level. This book does not encourage you to give up animals, but after reading this book why wouldn't you?
B0054JZC6E|2.0|don't waste your time on this....even if it is free creating an app is more fun and that takes alot of work  i cant believe i wasted my time on this i know its free but RIP OFF i bet its free because that's how much it sucks
B0046MOVD0|5.0|love watching them get wet in the shower room together and fighting the big nasty zombie. The japanese girl zombie in the beginning of the movie is hot too, love it when they all get wet!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This free solitaire is very nice even though it is free. Quick load and snappy play. All you can ask for in a plain jane game
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Someone I know suggested that I watch this show.  He's a huge Star Trek fan, and while I don't mind the show, I never really followed.  This gave me some preconceived notions of what Battlestar Galactica might be like.  I'm glad I got over those notions!  Battlestar is a gritty, intense character and story driven series.  All the main characters and even some of the more important minor characters well be fleshed out and in great detail.  I also thought that the characters were very deep and multidimensional, so it added a fair amount of realism (on the personal level.)  The story will keep you on the edge of your seat while you watch the fleet suffer through its journey (some good times will be had, but there is a lot of crazy things that happen to everyone involved!)  I really like how most of the questions one might ask are answered (or resolved) by the time the show ends.<br /><br />When watching this show, one might find him/herself  questioning ideas about politics, religion and social/ethical values.  I certainly did, and for me, this was a very attractive aspect of watching Battlestar.<br /><br />At any rate, experiencing Battlestar Galactica for the first time should be about surprises.  They do a great job playing their hand close to their chest, and you definitely are made to wait to find a lot of things out.  You might be curious to read up on it on Wiki or hit the forums for more information, but chances are you'll ruin some surprises.  Also, the \\"webisodes\\" are quite boring.  Save'em for after the show, if you're interested in watching.  (they might be a little less annoying if they stitched them all together so you didn't have to load a 4 minute clip 10 times over to complete them.)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game I ever played the best part of it is its is all free sweat right
B0055SWM08|5.0|nice challenge, good variety of levels that keep you interested. very calming graphics and sound. all - round pleasant game experience.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|I gave this a 5-Star rating because that's as high as they go.  It's more than that, though.  Excellent.  Just buy it.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|This game was great until it started crashing. Glad this wasn't a paid app. Please update this game to fix the issue.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|if you like to play games and don't want to download a lot of apps this one is good. it has a little bit of everything in one place.
0062101897|5.0|Great book a little on the expensive side. Was a Christmas present and my daughter in law loved it! Arrive in plenty of time for her present
B0054JZC6E|4.0|enjoy these fun mini games!  I would recommend. this app to my friends and family. this is a great way to entertain yourself without having to be deeply involved.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|The first time I reviewed this movie, I kind of panned it.  I must have just been in a bad mood or something.<br />After having seen it once in the theater, I rented it again this weekend just to give it one more chance.  I liked it a lot more the second time.<br />Maybe it's just that MI III and MI IV were so different one from the other.  I was expecting another III and I got something I wasn't expecting.  I'm not sure.<br />I enjoyed the movie a lot more this time though.  It was a lot of fun.  Don't hesitate watching it.  It's worth the time and money.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Quick fun mini-games! If you have a couple of mins or even an hour to kill these little games can be just.what.you need. Even my 3 year old.can play most.of them. So orbit get stuck somewhere and forgot to bring something 4 her to play with I can keep her busy which is worth her weight in gold! :)
0440244412|5.0|The book was wonderful but the audio book was a little weird.  The voice of Jericho Barrons was guttural and harsh, it totally made a different image of him in my mind.  His voice on the audio book was almost overwhelming, I was glad I read the book first, before I listened to it, otherwise I would have thought of him as quite a scary character.<br /><br />Edit<br />After I wrote this review I listened to Darkfever, the first book in the series.  Instead of having a male and female narrator it was just a female narrator who did the male voices.  I totally missed the voice of Barrons from Shadowfever, the female narrator in the Darkfever audio book made him sound like a old woman.  I guess this was one of those \\"the grass isn't greener on the other side\\" moments.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|I have been into Pink Floyd for awhile now.  Somehow I never have owned an album by them & then this \\"hits\\" cd came along so I had to go out and purchase it.  It's a great collection of songs that most people have probably heard at some point in their life before.  Every song on here is great so it's kinda hard to choose a favorite from this album.  It's a great cd to add to your collection if your already a Pink Floyd fan or just getting into the band.  Classic rock at its finest is what this cd is all about.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Amazing software. I have not had any issues with it. Streams video, music, and mp3 very well. High quality product. Lots of other uses I have yet to explore.<br /><br />(edit)<br />Have been using this product steadily since purchase and it maintains a 5 star review.
B00356CO1E|5.0|I literally just finished my first day of the Level 1 workout, and was so inspired by it, I had to immediately write this review to encourage others to purchase this DVD.  I always watched The Biggest Loser, and was always so inspired.  I have the Biggest Loser Xbox Kinect game, and it is no where near as effective as this DVD.  Jillian Michaels really is a great trainer.  I've watched other workout DVDs before, and never have they been truly inspiring enough to keep me going through those difficult portions of the circuit when you just want to quit.  I always wanted to get a personal trainer, but never wanted to spend the money, but doing this workout is honestly the closest you could ever get.  I'm not going to lie, it is incredibly difficult.  Especially for me, because I almost never do cardio, usually only mild weight lifting.  I am TIRED and shaky.  But I'm a person who only has 15-20 pounds to lose, and after finishing this, I truly believe if I stick to it, this workout will get me to my goal within a month.  If you're reading these reviews to make a decision about this purchase:  DO IT.
B005C9YZIM|5.0|My entire family and I have absolutely loved the Special Edition of the Planet Earth Series.  From my 2 year old son, to my 16 year old nephew and 85 year old grandmother have enjoyed watching the series.  I purchased the series prior to Christmas as a more productive tv viewing alternative for all the young ones in the family during Winter Break.  However, the ENTIRE family would sit around to watch the next series.  Needless to say it is beautiful, educational, promotes critical thinking, and my favorite part, it has subtitles!!!!  I especially loved this feature since not everyone in the family speaks only English, we proudly speak Spanish as well.  I highly recommend this to anyone, any age, any language.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Read it. Trust me. You will not be sorry. It's a timeless story. I hope the author writes more great stories!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This kindle ap is the handiest Bible program I have ever used. I love the plan choices. I wish I didn't have to be on wifi to use it, but otherwise no complaints.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|It works really well, except I occasionally the app screen freezes I can still mess with my computer but nothing changes on my phone. Only by restarting the app can I see what's on my computer.  Other then that its been simple to use and I've found it really useful.
B002C6A6N6|2.0|I received the \\"complete\\" set for Christmas and was watching it in order.  To my dismay, there were TWO sets of Year TWO and NONE of Year THREE.  What a disappointment!  Because I've opened years One and Two (1 of them), I cannot return the entire set.  VERY disappointed to discover that I can find NO CONTACT info to be able to ask for an exchange of one set of disks for the other...  Venting, here, doesn't get me Year Three, I know but it will serve to warn others.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I was looking for an application that would stream videos from my desktop to my phone.  When I saw Splashtop, I could not believe how much it did and for such a reasonable price.  Watchout Logmein, this application does everything you do and more ...
042524489X|5.0|The lower rated reviews have come from people who aren't familiar with the series and are understandably confused. So start with book one and enjoy!  Hawke and Sienna have been among my favorites for a long time.  While some reviewers have said they don't like how long it took the relationship between them to reach - well, it's 'conclusion', I found it very refreshing.  She's 19 and a Psy and both are scared of the intimacy...give them some time, folks!  I did wish the nuances behind the X designation issue were a bit more complex, but I found this to be a great read.  And as silly as it sounds, I like the covers that have only bodies and no heads because I have these characters built in MY head and don't like covers with people on them (who usually look nothing like what I have pictured).  Can't wait for the next in the series!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this.game I play it everyday its great for little kids to play. yup i love it lol rate :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|u have to beat games to open others &amp; I love it cause a challenge is aways fun for me. If ur like me and enjoy challenges this is for u.
B0055SWM08|5.0|one really fun and challenging puzzle game! definitely worth $1! better than most puzzle games out there! :) most amazing puzzle game!
076790382X|3.0|I lived overseas for a  while and was struck by how much I learned about my own country coming back after several years absence.  I saw so many things I had never noticed before.  That clarity gave me the ability to make actual decisions about my life rather than blindly going with the flow.  Given my experience I figured this book would be right up my alley, but it turned out to be fusty and not particulalry insightful.  Did I smile while reading this?  I did.  I think I actually laughed several times.  Did I take anything from the book that struck me as unique or challenging.  Nope.  Bryson seems like he would be fun to hang out with, charming and funny, but that is just not enough for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome games. I really enjoy playing them. good time passers. easy for kids and adults. loving all of them. cant wait to unlock more games
B000YJ85BI|5.0|That is what this book needs more Gratuitous SEX. Zoe should have been getting pregnant at lest three or four times by now.

Sounds like Monkey shines to me.<br /><br />Actually folks this is a great final book or the heck of a start to a new series.<br /><br />dray
034552554X|5.0|This was a great book. Working in the foster care system made this book even more relevant for me. I have recommended it to friends.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Yes it is like some of HH's and RH's as well I do happen to like the different way each one goes. This did it much different than either of the others. So that I like it for that very reason.<br /><br />It is up to date and believable as well.<br /><br />dray
B00004U2GH|5.0|What can one say about this recording?  It is much more than the music, although the music is great.  It is about the men and the place.  Johnny cash reached out to some of the roughest and most outcast men in America.  He did not condescend or act righteous - he was real.  The songs are gritty and harsh.  Cash asks \\"San Quentin, what good do you think you do?  You've cut and scarred me through and through.  You bend my heart and mind and you warp my soul.  Your stone walls turn my blood a little cold.\\"  This is the reality of prison, both then and now.    This is not an easy or enjoyable recording, because the setting was not easy or enjoyable.  But it is a tour de force with power and might. It has as much power today as it had in 1969.  Get it now!
B000JQUMPI|1.0|I just could not get in to this and had it because it has certain items I needed to know.
0316067938|5.0|i really love the detail in this book, how we learn more about bella's lullaby& so on.. i'm very pleased, i'm only half way through at the time, it's a lot thicker than i actually thought it would be! i would recommend it to anyone, seriously. even if you've seen the movie, you should really really give the books a read! you will love it! thanks for listening!
0307959856|4.0|I found this book quite entertaining. For those reviewers who do not feel that James captured Austen's prose, I disagree, and I have read all of Austen's texts and Pride and Prejudice several times (and many of its sequels, some good and some bad), so I feel I speak from an Austen background. I felt that she created a strong background for her characters' lives from when we left them on Jane and Elizabeth's wedding day. I loved the way that James used her opening chapter to provide a background for those who may not have read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (I cannot imagine that these readers exist!). She did an especially good job of letting us see Mary and her marriage and how it came about, which was very believable. However, I thought that Colonel Fitzwilliam came off to a disadvantage, for I remember him as a much nicer character in the original. For those reviewersw who did not feel that James did a strong enough character building novel, remember that the murder is the primary focus.   I also loved the way James dropped in moments from \\"Persuasion,\\" Sense and Sensibility,\\" and \\"Emma\\" without hitting her readers over the head. If some readers (again, I cannot imagine whom these are!) have not read P & P, this would not spoil their enjoyment, but for those of us who have (and those who have read all Austen's works), this was great fun. I give this book a 4 1/2 for I felt that at the trial, Darcy acted in a way that I would not imagine him acting. His sense of decorum slips a little and he becomes agitated. I did not feel he would do this.   Altogether, I was not disappointed in this novel, and I found it refreshing coming from James, whose books are deeper, darker, and sometimes just a little long winded--and here, too, I have a background, for I have read all of P.D. James and have watched all her novels that have been televised, mourning when the character of Dalgleish was taken over by a new actor in the last two productions.  I so missed Roy Marsden and his Dalgleish. I cannot even remember the name of the other actor!
0062082353|2.0|This guy gets 5 stars for being a SEAL and a good shot, 2 stars for lack of maturity.  High score comes down to skill and being in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />Hathcock did it the hard way -- and with character.  Kyle claims to be a Christian, which I accept, and recognize that many SEAL's and Snipers are probably Christians as well.  The difference between those SEAL's, Snipers, Lurps, and Marines, including Hathcock, is Kyle comes across, in my opinion, as enjoying the killing he did.  Truly, one for the Gipper.<br /><br />There's satisfaction in getting the bad guys in war but for Kyle, it comes across as absolute glee.  Like Iraq was a big arcade and he was shooting ducks high 5'ving friends after every kill.<br /><br />Found it annoying to read comments from Kyle's wife every few chapters explaining her side of their relationship.  He marries her, has children who he admits to not connecting with, admits that she comes 2nd after being a SEAL, treats her like a door mat.  WTF!  Why did he marry her?  Was this honorable?  Why is she even in the book?  Stand by your man?  Boo hoo she cries at home in her robe nursing her child incapable of caring for her other child.  Did Kyle know this?  Did he even care?<br /><br />Carlos Hathcoock admits to never enjoying the kill, and always explaining that only a psychopath would enjoy killing another human.  That killing in war is a job, nothing more -- certainly not enjoyment.<br /><br />Only other complaint is the lack of detail throughout much of the book.  Operations are glossed over or given lip service.  All this comes across as flip and callous.<br /><br />So, maybe Kyle has grown up since leaving the Navy and gotten some maturity in the process.<br /><br />UPDATE:  reading today's headlines about the court marshall of a Marine for killing 26 ''innocents'' in Iraq.  Question of rules of engagement came up along with the ''moral'' issues of whom to shoot.<br /><br />Kyle states in his book all his shots needed to be justified by ROE guidelines.  (ROE:  can't shoot an unarmed person.)  So, when he shoots an insurgent (who drops his AK), another insurgent steps up to retrieve his fallen comrade's AK, Kyle shoots him as well.  When insurgents send out a child to retrieve the AK, Kyle backs down refusing to take the shot.  Sure looks like a flip flop to me.  Guess an AK in the hands of a child is incapable of killing another buddy.  More Christian ethos?<br /><br />Did Kyle smack Jessee in his dreams?  Such a creative and fantasy filled imagination!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm thankful for this app because it continues to bring me closer to God. The fact that its a portable worship library is what drew me in. The options of which translation you want and the reading plans are what keep me using this app almost every single day.  Praise God for the folks over @ YouVersion
B000063DFQ|5.0|I have to admit that the IM & Killers albums with Paul Di'Anno was my Iron Maiden and I didn't take to Number Of The Beast with then new upstart Bruce Dickinson. However after hearing NOTB, Hallowed Be Thy Name, Run To the Hills and 22 Acacia Avenue from friends (or fiends) I decided to take a chance on POM. This was the album that put me over into accepting Bruce Dickinson and attending the World Piece Tour solidified my allegiance!<br />Understand that in the context of the time Metal-heads were very ardent and you had to earn their loyalty. Where Eagles Dare, Revelations, The Trooper, Flight of Icarus & Die With Your Boots On were immediate standouts for me. Overall the entire album is excellent! And of course Bruce went on to become the face of and record many great albums with IM.<br />This was one of the definitive albums of my misspent youth and The New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Yes, The Number of the Beast went on to be one of their classics, but for me Piece of Mind was the ticket!

B005KR6OBM|1.0|Sears has this boxed set for $69, and other sellers have it listed for under $100.00. This price is ridiculous.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|far too many ads. the games are a nice diversion, but it feels like there is sn unnecessary ad after every other game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an awesome application.  You just have to have a downloaded version for when you are not connected to wifi.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Very fun game with a simple objective yet very addicting. The only problem is that the ordering of the levels are very irregular. You get this super hard level and after that a very easy level. Order the levels better and I'll give it 5 stars.

This week the program has begun requiring me to log-in every five minutes or so, and often it does not recognize my password for three or four attempts.  I suspect the API has changed, but it's still reall really annoying.  If it worked properly it would get four stars (nothing gets five - perfection is simply not possible).

0062082353|1.0|Im half way thru this book and so far I am not impressed. Too much MF this and MF that(cursing). He also gets close, in my opinion, to toeing the line in disrespect in comments regarding his service and the SEALS in general. It switches back between he and his wife, who I couldn't care less hearing from. He talks about bar fights and other things that do not impress me at all.<br /><br />I will follow up once finished, but this is NOT a must read from cover to cover so far. So far I wouldn't recommend.<br /><br />01-05-2012**************UPDATE<br />This book is self serving. I do not recommend. Its not a good read at all. It repeats itself and the switching between he and his wife is annoying. I hope I can muddle thru to the end.<br />*******************************<br /><br />01-10-12****************UPDATE<br />I have finished slugging thru the book. I find Chris Kyle to be a murderer and proud of it. While the SEALS and like minded groups have missions that MUST be done, I don't think writing a book about it is appropriate. I think the world of the SEAL program, but not so much about Kyle. He ENJOYS killing, and says as much. EGO EGO EGO. And the constant bar fights are a sign of a deeper problem......one he makes light of.<br /><br />Chris Kyle: I am not impressed with your book, nor your bragging. I would rate this ZERO stars of Amazon would allow.

B005HP2JAM|2.0|The cave is amazing and so the paintings. The paintings are so alive that you can look at the eyes of the animals and it is like they are looking at you. Herzog has his own style. It worked for his other productions but not for this one. Nothing worst than having a loud music when the narrator talking. To me it is so stupid when they have music so loud when infact if you would walk in the cave there would be no noise at all less alone Herzog's voice and a loud music. I do not watch documentary for drama, I watch to learn facts so I need to hear the narrator not the music. Herzog's accent and voice was good for the bears in Alaska not for this cave. The cave and paintings are a must see. I highly recommend watching this since it is the only way to see the cave but knowing that Herzog's style, voice and that loud music are irritants not compliments.
B000TRTPW8|4.0|Certainly, Saxon is not well-known to the radio-toting pop rock and hair band fans of the eighties -- but every true metal head has given them a listen at least once. And it seems that the general consensus amongst true metal enthusiasts is that the band represented a solid rock foundation for future, more elaborate and sophisticated bands in the hard rock/metal arena. And it seems that most Saxon listeners point to Power and the Glory as the band's best, most compelling release.  With sounds similar to AC/DC, Krokus, Iron Maiden and Fastway, Power and the Glory is an interesting collection of riffs and lyrics that takes the listener between two distinct worlds: hard rock recklessness and metal fantasy. There is little tying these two basic themes together -- but the overall energy and thoughtfulness behind the music makes the lack of continuity of the album a small sacrifice. These songs are memorable for their incessant riffs and hooks and the sense that the band is trying to reach the listeners' sense of imagination.  Of course, at first listen, some of album's themes and hooks seem somewhat amateurish and adolescent, but this is the magic of the album for many. Many of the listeners upon first listening to Power and the Glory were just that: amateurish and adolescent -- and we didn't care either!! And thus we get to the core reason behind many a metal head's appreciation of this album: it is a time capsule that represents a time when metal was yet to be fully explored; when less-well-crafted, not over-produced, and a \\"rock if you are commercial or not\\" mentality was the draw that sold millions on the metal lifestyle. Metal was for everyone who had a mind to let loose their inhibitions, release some tension, and stick their fingers in the face of oppressors, authorities, and the status quo. The Power and the Glory is a rocking representation of these things -- exactly.  So, to all you wielders of casual 1 and 2 star blastings -- take a seat my little pop devotees. This is metal my friends -- the good, the bad, and the ugly. And Saxon's Power and the Glory, with all its imperfection and lack of multi-million dollar production polish, is exactly what sounds like: a British metal band finding itself amidst a rapidly growing metal movement. And most metal fans will agree -- Saxon did a mighty fine job with this album.  My favorite tracks: (1)Power and the Glory, (3)Warrior, (4)Nightamre, (6)Watching the Sky, (8)The Eagle Has Landed.  Final Opinion: Power and the Glory is a solid addition to any metal enthusiasts CD vault.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like it so do my kids I would really reccomend this to everyone I know because its enjoyable
0307959856|2.0|I was also disappointed in this novel, having had great respect for James' other work.  I concur with various other complaints already voiced: flat-footed style with only rare moments of wit; poor pacing, etc.  But, as an Austen fan, I was most let down by the main characters.  Elizabeth, Darcy, Georgianna -- I recognize none of these from Pride and Prejudice.  Where has Lizzie's spirit and sassiness gone?  And is there anything more to Darcy than his love for his wife and his anxiety about family reputation?  I had hoped that James' version of these characters would develop and enrich what Austen created, but instead they are pallid imitations of the originals.
B000MAPQ0W|1.0|Horrible, the dvd came looking like bootleg. Dirty, sticky tags and a like a hand cut out label. So pissed off because this was supposed to be a Christmas gift that I wasn't able to give in the end. I returned it and never got my money back. I'm NEVER shopping on amazon again.

My older kids and I often quote lines from this movie as we have appreciated its cleverness.  We also love the relationships portrayed and how they develop.  It's fun, it's clever, it's moving.  My older kids each request a copy for their own DVD library.

B005LB1MY6|3.0|Safe.  I felt like most of the songs on this album weren't even completed.  A lot of people are saying that Justice is progressing musically, but really...they are regressing.  The music sounds old and weak.  I felt like taking a nap after listening to it.  I was really excited after hearing Civilization for the first time last year, but now I realize they put that single out first because it's the only good song on the album.  I didn't expect them to make Cross part 2, I expected it to be new and different, but still be Justice.  I hope they do better next time.  I'm gonna go listen to Cross now :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun and creative and I like. the name 101-in-1 games +16 cool I also like it cause if you have nothing to do its easy as 123 just click and play
B005CM9DX6|5.0|Don't be fooled: Heritage is not a death metal album.  However, it is still definitely a heavy metal album.  A very jazzy metal album, but metal nonetheless.  I waited quite a while to purchase this album, as I'm a huge Opeth fan.  I don't mind that all the vocals are clean; I'm not a big fan of death vocals (normally), and I loved Damnation.  However, I wasn't sure if I was ready for a different musical style out of Opeth.  I shouldn't have worried.  All along, Akerfeldt has shown tremendous influence from '70s rock musicians and others seemingly far removed from the Scandinavian death metal scene; his solos are often more reminiscent of Pink Floyd than Nevermore; drum beats have often had a jazzy feel to them (a la Tool, for a similar contemporary metal rhythm feel); heavy (but tasteful) use of keyboards.  Well, this album shows that most clearly.  It is hauntingly beautiful at times, powerfully grooving at others, but throughout masterful and musical.  If I had to describe this new(ish) sound in one phrase: creepy jazz metal.  Or maybe evil blues.  Something like that.  My one and only complaint is that there are some repeated musical themes.  Classically, this would be referred to as \\"leitmotif,\\" but that implies that it is intentional; while I do not doubt Akerfeldt's creativity and ability, I do not know for sure if this was, in fact, intentional (for a great example of repeated musical themes that are clearly done for effect, see Trent Reznor's \\"The Fragile\\").  For example, the basic riff to \\"The Devil's Orchard\\" reappears at least twice, in slight variations; this is not the only occurrence of a repeated phrase.  Was this simply Akerfeldt discovering some super awesome, evil, complex musical idea, and falling into the trap of making the album sound unified, conceptually, by unintentionally reusing it?  Or was it a deliberate echo of the earlier song, tying the music of the album together in a deeper way?  I haven't read any comments on this elsewhere, so I am forced to assume that it is not, in fact, deliberate; however, that does not decrease my enjoyment of this album's wonderful, wonderful tunes.  And yes, I admit that it exposes me as more than a little nerdy to have noticed in the first place.  Track lengths seem right on.  This isn't Morningrise or Deliverance; however, songs ranging from 6:40 to 8:32 feel as long and epic as previous Opeth entries, while shorter, heavier, faster songs clock in right around 4 minutes (still a bit longer than a 3 minute metal jam).  None of the songs feel like Akerfeldt and company have shorted the listener of an experience.  Like all Opeth songs, they go from inception to completion, without care to either brevity or length.  Or public approval, for that matter.  Track Breakdown:  Heritage- short piano introduction (2 min).  Could easily pass as a neo-classical interlude or miniature.  Very slight jazz tones on the chords.  Slightly melancholic, almost minimalistic.  Satie fans would probably like this tune.  The Devil's Orchard- if you've heard one song from this album, it's this one.  Don't worry: the slightly frazzled sound to Michael's voice is intentional.  Of that I have no doubt.  Wicked and creative bass-guitar-keyboard riffs, driving yet jazzy beat.  Despite the Nietzsche-inspired refrain, when taken with the entirety of the lyrical content, it comes across as much more creepy and Black Sabbath-ian than evil and agnostic.  I Feel the Dark- excellent, excellent track.  Perfect length.  The melody uses an off-sounding flatted (or natural minor) seventh, vice the sharped seventh that sounds so natural in this style (especially given the previous track's inclinations), and that makes it even more unsettling.  A laid back style, considering what comes both before and after.  Wonderful acoustic-ish breakdown that leads to a not-so-acoustic breakdown; very odd feels here and there.  It would be a darkly relaxing track if not for that middle section.  Slither- solid groovy kindof metal track; I think Michael would approve of the \\"cock rock\\" label.  You've heard music like this, but it's still excellently done, and Akerfeldt's voice is exceptional here; his high notes are perfectly in tune, with a hint of raspy abandon (a la Billy Joel or David Bowie).  Ends on an extended acoustic run which is almost medievally gorgeous (think Sepultura or Black Sabbath acoustical passages).  Nepenthe- perfect counterpoint to the initial fury of Slither, this track begins more mellow and subdued than music has a right to be.  It sounds like whales making love while \\"The Division Bell\\" plays in the background...and that, somehow, comes out glorious.  The melody implies loss and a dull, aching pain (vice sharp and fierce); appropriate, given the title.  When this track decides to rock out, the wailing guitars and chaotically complex keyboards give an impression of neurosis in full swing (mental disorders, not the band).  Haexprocess- others have commented that this track is a gem, and they are right.  Hauntingly beautiful melodies; appropriately dark lyrics.  Like virtually every track on this album, Opeth are not content to maintain that one concept throughout, deciding to vary meters, styles, you name it.  Every path they take leads to awesome here.  Famine- this song contains perhaps both the softest passages and the heaviest riff.  Wild live flute gives an accent of pure mania.  Everything about this track screams to the dark in a voice clad in velvet.  The Lines in My Hand- another upbeat, rocking track, with an appropriately shorter length (ironically, in Opeth's previous albums, ballads tended to be short, while the heaviest tracks tended to be the longest; see both Deliverance and Ghost Reveries for perfect examples).  More great acoustic melodies, vocal harmonies, and grooving bass lines.  The second half of this song is very much like Slither in its aggression, while the first half is much more mellow, while still driving inexorably forward at a solid clip.  Folkore- the longest track on the album by almost two minutes.  Great Addams Family style intro, giving way to another medieval-sounding tune, set to a fascinating phrasing of three measures of 6/8 followed by a measure of 7/8 (the verses follow Metallica's lead in \\"Mama Said,\\" maintaining a base 6/8 without that extra beat at the end of each phrase).  It's a natural-feeling complex rhythm a la Rush, Dream Theater, Tool, and Alice in Chains, and it simply adds to the creepy, odd, and slightly anachronistic feel to this track.  It ends on a several minute melodic breakdown (in standard time, funny enough) that is absolutely fantastic, with almost a beautiful '80s rock feel (not '80s glam rock, before you start casting stones...no pun intended).  Marrow of the Earth- a beautiful outro that, like the title track, actually contains zero heavy, fast, or grinding passages.  It's simply a beautiful, mournful instrumental; every instrument comes together perfectly.  It makes me sad without giving insight to said melancholy's genesis; you are free to import your own demons and devils.  (Bonus Tracks)  Pyre- another beautiful and mellow track.  Contains no hard passages, but does contain plenty of beautiful and almost antediluvian musical themes.  Face in the Snow- a \\"plugged-in\\" acoustic track, very similar in its mellow jazziness to Pink Floyd.  It's not insignificant that both bonus tracks are mellower than any non-instrumentals on the \\"proper\\" album.  Both are gorgeous.  Taken on their own, I would give each track 5 stars (out of 5).  If I were to rate them all out of 10...that would require extra thought (and room), and I've about run out of both, so I will stick with Amazon's 5-star style.  Seriously, there is not a single track on this album that I consider to be wasted time, or an ounce less than the ideal accomplishment of its goal.  I really wish I could select a favorite song or two for you, but I cannot; you will have to make do with the elucidation ofeach track's styles, above, if you wish to pick one or two most befitting your particular musical leanings to send through your ears and cavorting tantalizingly through your brain.  But why would you?  You've read this far.  Buy the album, already.  .....I suppose I could have saved myself about 30 minutes of time by just starting off with those last four words.  ;)  -Roger
B002RL7VKC|5.0|I gave this to my 3 year old son for Christmas and he loved it (along with his two siblings and dad).  It was out all day long.  We love duplo--great toys for a variety of ages that actually last.  My son loves tractors too, so that made it even more of a hit!  I would highly recommend this lego set!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I use this app to have mindless fun when I only have a few minutes that isn't enough to start reading a book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is enjoyable and fun. I would recommend this game to my friends. I thing they will enjoy it just as much as me. The ups of this game is that it gives you lots of bonus points for things. For example I had gotten bonus points once for being persistant and trying to win a mini games 5 times. The downs about this game is that it takes quite a while to beat a game and also you have to get a lot of points to unlock the locked games. Other than that I would say this is a great game!
B0014BECF8|5.0|I have been a fan of George Michael for more than 25+ years...From his yearly days in the 80's until now.....<br />His voice and style of singing are flawless...Regardless of his personal issues, (and we all have them), George Michael<br />the Artist/Songwriter is classic...Many of the songs on this CD are timeless; Jesus to a Child, simply beautiful!, Careless Whisper, when you hear him sing this song, you are hearing him at his best without fluff...Father Figure, undeniably one of his greatest songs ever.<br /><br />I wish him the best and hope to hear more from him now and in the future..Very few artist sing like this anymore...and if you are a 60's, or 70's baby, you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />If you have never listened to any of his music, do yourselves a favor, and buy this CD...Pop it in your player at home, sit back and chill....His music will literally put you in a place of calm and at times make you want to get up and dance.....you will not regret it!

B004EBZX6W|5.0|I usually know where the hot spots are in my neighborhood, and I sure know where there are no networks on my hikes, but this analyzer told me when I was having problems with connectivity in my home office. I started \\"losing strength\\" a couple of nights ago (the bars went from 5 to 1) and, with a business network account, this just shouldn't happen. But I used the Wi-Fi Analyzer and sure enough, mine was one of the weakest of six networks in the area. Then I noticed a pattern: always weaker at night. Last night, I had to \\"reinstall\\" the connection, and today it was confirmed by my provider that they've been having problems. The Wi-Fi Analyzer got me a one-month credit! (Results may vary: I've been with the same provider for 5 years.)
B005VPRET4|5.0|My daughter just got this set two days ago for her 7th Birthday, and we had a blast putting it together. Now she's serving cakes, milkshakes and hamburgers to all her lego friends. The set is very well designed, with details that add so much character to it. My daughter and I both LOVE the new design, and LOVE the new design of minifigures as well..they're so cute!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun. and you get free rewards for basically just completeing games and playing for a certain amount if hours/minutes. so worth it
B0063IH60K|4.0|I'm glad I installed this game. The fact that it's free makes me even happier. The ads are not annoying and the gameplay is simple and enjoyable.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This CD is even better than I expected. I only break down and buy a full album if I've enjoyed at least 3 songs off of it and I can easily say there is not one bad song on here. I can't wait to hear what they come out with next!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|kinds fun and kills time. my pen makes it easier to play a lot of the games. the cost of the gamesis a little high though. and wish it were better games to start with.
B0063IH60K|4.0|If not for the ads this app would be perfect. A pay version needs to be offered. Until then I'll keep ignoring the ads.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|Works as described. Tried other apps like Logmein an consedering this one cost 1/4 the cost and dose the same thing you get the same bang for less your of buck.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is free after all, but that being said, it's a great way to pass the time. It keeps the player entertained and rewards players with points to spend on new games, which keeps the player invested
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is one of the first apps downloaded for my kindle fire and I love it! hours and hours of fun entertainment. I would say fun for anyone 4-100!
B000002KO3|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing.  I am a big Talking Heads fan and don't really like saying what their (or any other artists') \\"best\\" album is.  To be honest, how can you listen to this and then listen to \\"More Songs About Buildings and Food\\" or \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" and care to compare?  Please, fellow reviewers and music fans, explain to me one thing that I don't understand...why give an album 5 stars and then say that half of the album is boring?  I think that this record is meticulously crafted, perfectly produced and is brilliant beyond any words that I or anyone else can conjure up in a review.  THE WHOLE ALBUM.  Try to find a review from any website or publication where the critic gives this less than a perfect score.  The amazon.com description of this album says that the last half is good for sleeping to.  Seriously, are you kidding?  Are you joking around with me right now?  Sleep through any of this album and you will miss out on some seriously soul-stirring art.  Only geniuses come up with the kind of music that Brian Eno and Talking Heads put together in 1980.  Listen with open ears to the entire album and hear what all the fuss is about.

0545265355|5.0|One of my favorite series to date (besides Harry Potter). Couldn't put it down for a week. I recommend it to anyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a terrific app, one I've now used both on the iPad and my Kindle Fire.  I love the variety of translations offered and even better are the many reading plans you can select and even set reminders to help keep you on track.  It is so simple to find verses and books easily.  Definitely an app I use often and would highly recommend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is the best game in the world because. I like cheesevand you should to but really if you like good games don't buy this one
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this product is free and it is a fun way to waste time. some of the controls are bad but most are easy and fun
B0054JZC6E|2.0|too little game, too many ads. Sucks to have to unlock games with point system. Also to try a failed game again you have to select from menu instead of hitting replay from the game.
B005HSL626|4.0|this game is so good there's one really bad thing I'm addicted anyone know where the fruit ninjas rehab is hopefully its close cx
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the game you. never no what levels are goon to be it is fun and interesting I don't know why I'm doing this
B005N7CA3A|5.0|Let me start the review by just saying: \\"The Best Darren Hayes Album to date!!!!\\". The thing that makes this album absolutely amazing is that it was done by Darren Hayes, who is one of the most complete artists of the century.....he is to POP music in the 21st Century what Pet Shop Boys and Erasure were in the 1980s and 90s!!! I wasn´t a fan of Savaga Garden, specially after Affirmation, but his solo carrer has been very succesfull with all the merits!!! His firt album Spin, was his weakest, although it has some great tracks in it! Then he released Tension and The Spark, which I thought was the best pop album in many years....perfectly produced, written and reminded me a little bit of Depeche Mode (one of the best band ever in history of music). When you thought that there´s nothing much around left to impress a music fan, he releases Delicate Sound We Made....It just blew my mind! A POP Double Album with such consistency throughout the entire album. Amazing songs from beginning to end and it became my fave in the first round of listening. A truly POP Masterpiece!!!!  I think Secret Codes is his best effort yet for one reason: it has songs that sound like the best songs in \\"Tension\\" and in \\"Delicate\\", without one \\"ok\\" song....it´s filled with beatiful songs, his vocals are unbelievable as usual and the lyrics seem to perfectly translate what the melody is almost deperate to say....!!!  My only complaint is the time to release it......I don´t want to wait more 4 year for another album!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very useful app for comprehensive weather across the country. Useful when traveling.  Try it, and remember that all weather apps give slightlly different results.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app daily for personal Bible reading (according to one of the provided plans). My husband and I also use it to do a Bible study together on Christian Parenting- also included in the app!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is one of those films everyone should see. I found it balanced and informative - depressing as well, but in a good way. Watch and pass on the word.

B005M7P9XE|5.0|This album has it all - great singles, great album tracks, great vocals, great production. My personal favorites are Illuminated, Better Than Love, and of course, Wonderful Life, one of the best tracks I've ever heard.   The [[ASIN:B005M7P9XE Deluxe Edition]] is obviously the version to get - I was really close getting the Japanese version, but with this you get so much more - B-sides, some acoustic demos and their Christmas single, first time released on CD. And the bonus DVD is pretty amazing too, containing their performance from Berlin (they're pretty popular in Germany!) and ALL of their music videos, even the early/low-budget ones! It's obviously a must-buy.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love this app. This is my first app review ever and that is because I keep finding more and better functionality in the youversion Bible. It is super fast to get to any verse, the bible sections you want are read out loud, you can annotate, you can choose from several bible plans. I also love that with a click.you can access a different Bible translation, even in a different language. I like that you can download for offline use. I only wish they had more 'Catholic' versions. But really awesome awesome awesome!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This CD is absolutely wonderful.  Michael Buble's style brings about sweet memories while creating new ones.  Highly recommend this CD to anyone looking for a fun, fresh, yet traditional take on Christmas music.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game (or 101 games), each game is very fun and entertainment. I play it a lot in my free time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|a game ive always enjoyed since I was a kid. this app is east to use and there are several variations to keep it interesting.
0525423273|5.0|Anna is prone to not paying enough attention to what her friends are going through, wanting men who are taken, using her fists when words would be better, and shying away from addressing issues she should be discussing with her friends and more than friends.  She tells lies to people she loves and accepts kisses from people she doesn't.  She isn't a bad girl, but she's no saint either.  Her principle love interest, Saint Clair, is revealed in time to have his own set of flaws, despite his name.  Seemingly healthy relationships fail.  Imperfect parents act as poor role models for relationships and ignore their children's emotional needs.  Kids and teens cry.  The upshot of all this is a well developed story about imperfect people finding love despite their serious mistakes.  It is a masterpiece of understatement.  The story manages to be a compelling read despite a total absence of supernatural coincidences or powers, newspaper headline worthy events, violence more serious than a bloody nose, children who would be removed from their parents' custody if social services were aware of them, unreasonable school administrators, drug addiction, eating disorders, pregnancies or cutting.  The references to Paris, French phrases, big words, medical conditions, and classic movies are world expanding and add color without being pretentious.  If you hated \\"Family Oriented\\", made for TV, afternoon specials that are disguised health class propaganda, you'll love this book which recognizes that life is complicated, and that the rules of love aren't absolute.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this app. The ads aren't too overwhelming. I like the auto complete. I don't really have any complaints.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Various simple games that are easy to pick up, play for a short while, and move on with your life.
0321356683|5.0|Everytime I pick up this book I learn something new. I picked it up when I knew little about Java, know that I've \\"grown into it\\" it has been indispensible.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Beats the living crap out of all the Pdf readers I have tried... can easily copy text and send to Evernote... can add notes...bookmarks... etc... works quick... love the goofy thing. Spend the 3 freaking bucks.
0553382179|5.0|I bought it used here on Amazon and its great! The author really helps get to deeper issues and teaches you 'FLY'- 'finally loving yourself' and teaches you how to get your life and home organized without being a perfectionist or beating yourself up. Excellent! Thank you Flymomma!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best app ever.I thought this app wad the best because it is.more addicting than angry birds and dodd
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Inredible book.  At over 800 pages this book flew by.  It took just about 8 days and some late nights along the way.  For me a 5/5 book must be one that I can't put down and have to justify \\"just a few more pages.\\"   Great job
0811879542|5.0|My son 3.5 yo son loves this book.  very different.  He loves the colors and shapes.  What a great idea to make it a book that they can interact with!!!!
B0068TJLSY|1.0|This is another very lame and cliche film about aliens.  The story was incredibly predictable and was pretty weak.  I felt cheated after watching.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good variety and fun.  lot of games my five yearold can play. Also the games are pretty easy to unlock.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is a great movie.  It arrived new and undamaged.  I would recommend this show to anyone who like to laugh.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|In other words it sucked fangs big time at the box office in the U.S. pulling in only $18 million out of its $30 million budget. But it wasn't the only failure with money at the remakes/prequels box office in the year of 2011... Movies such as Conan: The Barbarian and The Thing, both truly entertaining and superb films didn't even cover the budget and Final Destination 5 pulled in almost the right amount. Fright Night was such a well thought out movie. It was a modern and extremely well done remake than not even David Tennant nor could Collin Farrell save from the Box Office!<br /><br />Plot: Jerry Danridge has moved next door to a peaceful family, Jane (Mother) and Charlie (Son) Brewster. They are very acceptant of him but when Charlie learns some information from his ex best friend Evil Ed Thompson that Jerry is in fact a vampire, He mocks him..... That is until Ed doesn't show up to school the next day... that makes him a little suspicious..... Hearing Jerry talk about how he'd better mind his own business.... He gets a bit worried then what sets it all off when he hears/sees his next door neighbor Doris meet a gruesome death! He soon seeks help from T.V. celebrity star Peter (Douchebag) Vincent... who immediately calls Charlie crazy and tells him to leave.... The big question lies within the original trailer (which mostly does cover the plot) \\"What would you do if you accidently discovered that the house next door was being occupied by something not human, no one believes you, not your mom, not your girlfriend, not even the police, it knows that you know, you'll do anything to protect yourself. but it'd do anything to protect it's secret!\\"<br /><br />Review: What a perfect remake... It is able to create something new while still maintaining the old in a \\"Modern\\" fashion. It has everything, Actors who act like today's society and not something just written down on a piece of paper they acted like they wanted to and did it perfect. It's got gore and blood, salty language, the only thing there wasn't in this remake was the sex scene which I felt was a breathe of fresh air mainly because most horror movies have at least one or two sex scenes in which this one would rather work on a real and secure level while still being different from the rest. This is how vampires should be not like Evil Ed described as fruity or love sick but they should be like the shark from \\"Jaws\\" or even the ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex from \\"Jurassic Park\\". Hell, it could even be as bad ass as Freddy Kruger with all the one liners Jerry Preformed such as \\"don't need an invitation if there is no house!\\" But I believe the greatest advantage this film had over the original was the blood and gore!<br /><br />Acting: Pure fun! And full of passion about each line that came out was perfect there were no bad actors in this film! Not even the security guard or the body guards were bad.... this is one of those films where there were no bad actors... well maybe some drunk/fowl mouth actors (such as Peter Vincent) but even he was great at acting!<br /><br />Gore: As I said before the gore was a great advantage over the original! We get grisly bites, a nasty severed arm, lots of blood splatter, throat slashing, some gory dead bodies and more! Beat that Ed to the Ward!<br /><br />Bottom Line: An indestructible, superb remake that will always have a place in my collection/heart! It deserves all the money it can get. it was just epic and genius! It definitely needs a sequel!<br /><br />Rated R for bloody horror violence, and language including some sexual references<br /><br />Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 7<br />For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 5
B005OCFGTO|3.0|When my son opened this item on Christmas morning, the case was broken.  I had not opened it beforehand, expecting it to be intact.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|maybe it's amazon, but I got this app here and on android market it's showing me that there is an update, but there are no updates here...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many games to choose from! I love this app. i think that my favorite game is curler. hard to put down!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Game is decent.  Very simple games with no instructions though. The ads are pretty irritating.  Wouldn not have gotten had I known there were ads. looking forward.to completing more though.
0439023521|5.0|This is just the first book of what became, my favorite book series!<br />I have never cared too much for fiction reading, but these books just had me hooked from the get-go!<br />It has a little bit of everything: action, drama (a bit more of this but still GREAT), love, a message, if you care to open your mind and understand it, and a story that will leave you wishing there were more than 3 books on this series!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great game on the Kindle Fire. It's pretty, the music is nice, and its fun. The game is also challenging to bring me back for more.
B004SIP9O2|4.0|The US DVD I have is censored. In the original movie, Jada Pinkett Smith's character gets stabbed many times in the cinema.  In this DVD, the killer merely grabs her as she tries to escape after she was initially knifed while seated. And then, the killer holds on to her while the people run around and then stabs her one final time.   Otherwise everything is in place.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game,  I love playing this it's a lot of fun and a great game for making the time go by. I like this game is much not only did I install it on my kindle I have it on my phone (a droid charge).
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop is awesome. It allows you to get on your desktop or laptop with your phone or tablet. I haven't had any problems with this app. If I need something at school that is on my computer I can easily look it up. An awesome buy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I heard the words, \\"post-apocalyptic America\\" I was immediately skeptical. It was only after the recommendation of a friend that I took a chance with this book.  All I had to do was read the first chapter.  The writing is not hard to get through and it keeps you engaged.  Truly a great book!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|ORDER IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED AND I RECEIVED IT IN A TIMELY MANNER. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS VENDOR OR PRODUCT TO ANYONE!
B004EPZ08O|5.0|I have the entire series thus far; I would definitely be open to purchasing any others they'd care to produce.<br />The big question is............why?  Why do I love this series?  You have to admit it's a bleak formula that they follow with strict accordance in each film.  Only the deaths of each new cast changes.  They're like slasher flicks with an invisible slasher at work rigging up these bizarre Rube Goldberg traps.  That's the part I like best, watching how one set of actions leads to something else that in turn causes something else to happen........and........Kapow!  There's a certain amount of macabre wit at work here, I like that too.<br /><br />Advice to the filmmakers, don't stop now and work faster, 3 years between films shows a bit of laxness on your part.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|Every song is epic.  Only reason it gets 4 stars is because you get really tired of epic grandeur after 12 songs and need to relax.  Also, it would be even more epic if the songs were about battle or struggle or something to match the imagery conjured by broad chords, foundational bass and wardrums, but instead its just about love and other stuff -- but who listens to words anyway.  No Light, No Light easily my favorite.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|too much bugging you to buy credits otherwise some quite interesting games. still a fairly decent time waster for free.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I bought this book because there were so many good reviews written. Now, I'm left to think whether or not the other readers and I read the same book.  This book reads like it was written by a little girl. The dialogues are not well-written and the plot is flimsy. Abby-or PIgeon-is a complete DISASTER as a heroine who can't seem to make up her mind about Travis. She is the one responsible for a lot of the drama and heartache in the book--which by the way, is totally unrealistic in itself. I mean, how do you sleep in bed with one guy and date another? If I was Parker, I would totally have gone ballistic too. By the end of the book, the plot was going around in CIRCLES. ENDLESS circle after circle--no substance, no real conflict. The author seriously overused this jealous boyfriend i'm-gonna-kill-you-if-you-so-much-as-look-at-my-girlfriend plot page after page.  I found myself rolling my eyes, just like Pigeon liked to do so many times. This book was cheesy, so cliché, underdeveloped, unrealistic, and just plain BAD.  And author, please get yourself a proofreader. So many grammar mistakes--drove me crazy.
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|13 is pretty solid. Musically, it's a blend of System Has Failed and World Needs a Hero, to me. Lyrically, it has no real lemons, but a couple of less-than-strong ones, though nothing super-retarded, like on the last two records. It doesn't have the catchiness of Kick the Chair or Die Dead Enough, at least not that I could detect on one listen, but it seems as though Mustaine was seeking to avoid common rhymes and cliches (thank God). Often, he doesn't rhyme at all, which I find usually to be a good thing in music. Most artists feel the need to rhyme all the time (heheh) and, consequently end up using the same word pairings that nearly every other lyricist out there has already exhausted. There are some very impressive, effective, ultra-fast metal riffs, but the album feels mostly hard rock--hard rock with that classic Megadeth metal tone and frequent double-bass drum figures in support. It's the most consistent MD album in YEARS. IMO, an excellent Megadeth discography looks like: Peace Sells, So Far So Good So What?, Rust in Peace, Countdown to Extinction, Cryptic Writings & 13, while an excellent compilation album could be made from the rest: Killing, Youth, Risk, Hero, System, UA & Endgame. This album is a long-awaited \\"win\\" for Mustaine and crew--an album that I feel is going to grow better with repeated listens. It's nice to have you back, Mr. Ellefson. I've always liked you better than the other Dave anyways...<br />4 stars because it isn't Rust in Peace and 5 stars needs to keep it's meaning.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|No amount of money could save this poor attempt at remaking the magic of the original. Jason Momoa is better suited to grunting as Drogo than trying to be Conan.   Swords, a lot of screaming, even more fake-board-break-throughs, and some impractical armor don't make a fantasy movie a success.   This film needs to sit next to the re-interpretations of The Phantom, The Shadow, and any of the Highlander sequels. The writing is on par with them as is most of the acting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Careful, some games are more addictive than others! You'll be busy for hours. Love having to work to open more games.
B004UVD0DO|5.0|En t'Attendant by M&eacute;lanie Laurent is a beautiful album. Laurent has a middle range beautiful voice.<br /><br />What attracted me to this album are the two songs done with Damien Rice. The two sound fantastic together, their voices harmonize perfectly. It's interesting to see who Rice is working with, after he and Lisa Hannigan parted ways. Laurent's voice is strong and closer to Rice's range, where Hannigan's voice is much higher range and mostly took a back seat to Rice's lead. The Laurent / Rice pairing is still beautiful.<br /><br />The opening song is an instrumental piece, piano and acoustic guitar. The other songs are what is good about singer / songwriters, the vocals are front and center in the mix. She wrote all the songs on this album. Two of the thirteen tracks are in English, the rest are in French. The arrangements are really well done, with acoustic guitar, cello, piano, and other stringed instruments. Her voice is sweet and pleasant, understanding the lyrics is almost not necessary to enjoy this album. Damien Rice produced this album, and some of his bittersweet melancholy pokes through. Overall this is an upbeat happy album.<br /><br />Laurent is very well known gorgeous actress in France. She was Shosanna Dreyfus in Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds. In a way, she has gone down a similar path as Charlotte Gainsbourg, Carla Bruni, and Catherine Deneuve - accomplished actresses that take on a singing career. Laurent has a voice on par with Bruni, a really fine popular voice. I love Gainsbourg because her voice is so different, it is not for everyone.<br /><br />En t'attendant - While waiting for you, the first song has a fast electric guitar hook over an orchestra. This is kind of classic French production, the voice is clear and well centered, but there is a lot of orchestra and production in the song. This song probably saw a bit of radio play in France.<br /><br />Everything You're Not Supposed To Be - starts with Damien Rice singing. Essentially this is an extension of Rice's O and 9. Laurent sings beautifully in English. This is the classic male female response song. The arrangement is a little fuller than Rice's album, but it is still sparse.<br /><br />Circus opens with an accordion and Laurent speaking the song. As a violin joins the accordion, she begins to sing. The song builds to the final moments where it's revealed this sweet sounding song is about him leaving her. The closing is a marching drum.<br /><br />Kiss is a beautiful up beat song, a little bit of Arcade Fire, Suburbs, feel, that closes with a child laughing.<br /><br />Je connais - I know - is one of the most beautiful songs on this album. She sings with so much passion and longing for the person she loves, she knows that he will not be there, but she will wait. The backing acoustic guitar is beautiful.<br /><br />Pardon - Sorry - another quiet, simple song with mostly an acoustic guitar backing. A cello blends in as the song builds. It is a sad song, her lover has left. She's sorry they will never go out again, it's her fault, and she is the one who sleeps alone in the end.<br /><br />Insomnie - Insomnia. Big orchestral arrangement, driving drums with a slow piano playing counterpart. Another song in the French pop music mold. This is a pleasant memorable song.<br /><br />I fait gris - It's gray outside (but more like the weather is overcast and it's an ugly day). This sounds a little like the theme from A Man and a Woman. Laurent sings about the bad weather, how they have to stay inside. As the sun comes out, she is leaving and standing at the train station, and he will sing alone.<br /><br />Papa, a sweet song about a woman telling her father she hopes she can find a man as good as him. The last words are about her getting over her small Oedipus complex to find a nice man. The song ends with a father and child talking and laughing. The first listening it is sweet. After those first few listenings it's a little bit saccharine.<br /><br />On Uncomfortable, she sings in French and Damien Rice responds to her in English. The effect is like a round, they sing over the top of each other louder and louder, until the end when they blend their voices and a lone cello finishes the song. The song is dramatic.<br /><br />The album closes with a piano solo.<br /><br />In so many ways, M&eacute;lanie Laurent reminds me of one of my all time favorite French groups, Autour de Lucie and their lead singer Val&eacute;rie Leulliot. If you enjoy this album, I think those would be a good choice (especially her solo album).<br /><br />This is a beautiful album. I think it plays well even if you don't understand French, Laurent sings with so much feeling and passion; it is easy to feel these songs.<br /><br />Damien Rice:<br />[[ASIN:B00009V7P8 O]]<br />[[ASIN:B000IU3XTM 9]]<br /><br />Lisa Hannigan:<br />[[ASIN:B001KL3GZE Sea Sew]]<br /><br />Charlotte Gainsbourg:<br />[[ASIN:B002V9L57A Irm]]<br />[[ASIN:B000NQR7UC 5:55]]<br /><br />Autour de Lucie:<br />[[ASIN:B000005DC5 Autour de Lucie]]<br />[[ASIN:B000005DCH Immobile]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005A898 Faux Mouvement]]<br />[[ASIN:B000RW75Z4 Caldeira]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002T9H2L0 Inglourious Basterds (Two-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]]On Uncomfortable, she sings in French and Damien Rice responds to her in English.

B006BDHAX0|1.0|no way to disable music on kindle fire.  App quality on amazon app store really sucks. and the app review system too.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|what needs to be said about the Harry Potter movies. Top notch and some movies are even a bit dark. Sad that they are all over.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The cover for my Kindle Fire is just right.  I could not ask for anything better. I like the way it folds into a \\"tripod\\" that helps with table reading.
B001BPQT8A|5.0|This is a great thriller. Big fan of Morgan Freeman and he puts on a great performance. will watch this over and over and the Blu-Ray Book is an awesome way to package a great movie

B0000025T6|5.0|Over the years I have accumulated a substantial amount of music with some albums in constant rotation, others making the cut once or twice a year, still others even less frequently - and then there's last week - and Nebraska.<br /><br />Even by Springsteen's lyrical standard of blue-collar despair, the world he creates in Nebraska is exponentially bleaker, introducing postcards from the abyss, gothic character sketches that exist well beyond redemption and are only too aware of their dystopian straits - an unsympathetic, veins open hymnal to serial killers, sociopaths and inveterate losers who have never even enjoyed the dignity of a downward spiral since they were never really born to run, just born at zero.<br /><br />Unlike his other work, in Springsteen's Nebraska there are no Mary's, Terry's or Sandy's who adapt to bad breaks and lowered expectations by cruising the carnival shoreline looking for amusement and distraction. On the contrary, Nebraska offers a marrow-eyed view of characters that willingly embrace self-destruction as a fitting and inevitable destination - all perfectly captured in Springsteen's austere, plaintive wail and six-string harmonica soundscape.<br /><br />Nebraska is truth-telling in its darkest form, songwriting made even more remarkable by Springsteen's iminent emergence as a flag-draped MTV god. Tom Joad notwithstanding, Bruce never really made it back to the desolation of Nebraska - although who can really blame him since it's really not a place that anyone would willingly visit often. Nebraska is however, Springsteen's finest work and a must-own, landmark album.

B004VMVTNU|2.0|This clock has more controls than the Space Shuttle. It's the Microsoft Word of clock apps, a victim of feature creep. Unusable for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|loving this app. having to unlock the additional games makes for a way better challenge then if they were all unlocked before hand. thanks for such a great app!
0060873027|1.0|I was very disappointed. I actually like both authors. Did not know that Mr Crichton had passed away. It is rare that another author can fill the shoes of the original. Totally failed here. Mr. Preston has written many books I have enjoyed. This attempt to carry on the concept initiated by Crichton was boring. No matter how hard I tried I could not suspend reality enough to accept what was going on. I will probably continue to read Mr. Preston, but will be guarded.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I saw this album reviewed a coupe of years ago on CBS Sunday Morning. The whole CD and DVD was terrific. I gave a copy to everyone in my family. They loved it.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it's a fine game. Good for passing the time on long, boring days. I give it five stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it. gives my kids something challenging. I Also enjoy the games and enjoy the challenge of competing with my children to score higher. the puzzles get the mind into working. eye and hand coordination activities are beneficial for the quick thinking. age appropriate for all ages. both young and mature will enjoy the games.

B005OLUOVA|5.0|The set I purchased new from Amazon was absoutely perfect and worth the wait! The price was well worth it just for the video catalog and \\"making of\\" videos alone.  The band did post information on production issues to their website with a promise to make good on any issues. For the diehard Rammstein fan it is a must. The U.S. tour starts soon and after all...Liebe ist fur Alle da!...so enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great variety of games! I especially like that you can unlock games early. For a free app I am greatly surprised.
0385535139|5.0|After reading the negative comments about this book, I was concerned.  However, I believe John pulled it off nicely.  The characters are just that, characters.    The founding members of the two-bit firm were marvelous.  Their buffoonery throughout the book was highly entertaining.  I enjoyed their theatrics in court and even enjoyed a chuckle or two at their expense.    The story flowed nicely and had a great ending.  I would highly recommend to John Grisham fans or soon-to-be John Grisham fans!

Swarup's vision of humanity is universal.

0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games are a time for celebration and pride...or at least that's what the Capitol likes for the citizen of the 12 remaining districts of what used to be North America to feel. But to anyone who is or loves someone from the ages of 12 and 18, The Reaping, the day in which \\"the tributes\\" are selected, celebration is the last thing on their mind.<br /><br />Katniss fears her chances of having her name called and having to fight to the death against the other tributes or die among them. But when the girl tribute's name is called for her district a fear worse than her own death presents itself. Without hesitation she volunteers to participate in the most captivating and memorable year of The Hunger Games the people will likely ever see.<br /><br />I don't have to tell you that this book came very highly recommended by...well, just about everyone. I hadn't really intended on buying the book for a while and thought that I might even skip reading them and just watch the movies instead. I honestly didn't know what the book was about. Maybe I'd read the blurb a while back but it wasn't something that drew my attention. Dystopia in general is of no real interest to me. I read The Road and liked it a lot but apart from that I prefer a story that is a bit less gloomy. When I got these books for a great deal I resigned myself to reading them and this is what I thought.<br /><br />First, I am glad that I picked the book up and began reading. It's very well-written and I read it rather quickly, which is saying a lot in the busy time of moving and packing. I didn't fall in love with the book or develop a crush on one of the male leads however so I hope not to disappoint readers by seeming less enthusiastic about my review. I'm not gushing, and I never really did while reading this book. I saw both guys through Katniss' eyes and neither appealed to me as anything more than a really sweet guy. I was more concerned with how the story would end and how they would each tackle the ever escalating amount of obstacles. There just didn't seem to be time or a place for love in my mind. I was too worried about things like humanity, mercy, and survival. I was immersed in the book and its pages, pushing past the gross scenes, clenching my teeth during the scary scenes, and trying to swallow the lump in my throat during the sad scenes.<br /><br />This book provoked emotions. I don't even know that the author had intended for us as readers to fall in love with a boy during this first book, but to focus on the survival of these brave characters in hopes of something happening later. I can't be sure of course, but that's how I came to feel by the last page.<br /><br />This story is about a girl braver than any I will likely ever know. She's strong and she's willful and selfless considering the circumstances. I liked Katniss right away. In a way in fact she reminded me of Katsa from Gracling. Her view was less harsh and her view on men was less that of a feminist. But the two characters are both brave and strong. She also reminded me a lot of Scarlett from Sister's Red by Jackson Pearce. This strong and brave female lead role is the kind of role model young girls need to read about and to those that haven't read the other two books mentioned and liked Katniss as a character I highly suggest that you pick them both up.<br /><br />I intend to read and finish the next two books soon, and perhaps when I pick up Catching Fire I might even find that now, there will be room enough to swoon a little. ;)f obstacles.

3822837849|5.0|This book is beautifully produced, just be aware of the size.  There are almost too many pages that make opening the book fully difficult but if you are a fan of Stieglitz, this is the reference book to own.  The images are outstanding.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Each song is better than the next. Absolutely fantastic CD, haven't tired of listening to it yet... the clear brilliance of his voice makes you smile and puts you inside any story he is telling. Buy many and give as gifts.... it's really that good.... great.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|I read the maze runner trilogy because it was reccomended for me when I purchased the hunger games trilogy. The book is amazing! So of course I got the second book in the series, the scorch trials. Both very great and interesting! Its something you cant put down! For me it was a fast read, but I never got bored with it! I'm 14 and this is the perfect series for me! A bunch of cliff-hangers... you wont be dissapointed!  Chuck was my favorite character, but...... you'll just have to read and find out! I would tell you... but I hate spoiler reviews!    I have not purchased the death cure yet, though. I cant wait to get my hands on it!
B004T0E2S8|3.0|the app is good, it doesn't have a button to favoritize songs on the kindle fire which makes this app kind of frustrating

B0063IH60K|4.0|Play this every night before going to bed. It's addictive and I love playing it. Works. well on my Kindle Fire.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Simply Blown away by this Blu Ray. Adele clearly has one of the superlative voices on the music scene today.  She expresses emotion exceptionally well, the depth and coloratura of her voice is amazing. The technical sound quality is also wonderful. I found myself adjusting both my Dolby decoder and picture settings to optimize the full experience.    Her betwixt song commentary adds a great deal to the depth of understanding of the emotional source material. It brings out a personal quality that rings strait to the heart true. Yes, there were fracking f bombs dropped, gee they were honest expressions of the wonderment of it all. She is after all a young British subject singing in Royal Albert Hall, one of the finest venues in the world.  It does highlight that there are British American cultural differences, perhaps a class thing too, all a really good thing.  ...All that's been said, what I want to strongly defend is the directing and editing.  The production is great.  The short views that are used focus visual interest. The cuts of Royal Albert Hall, the instrumental and vocal accompanists, and the 'posh' crowd, are all wonderful.  Each angle and frame is beautifully shot. I wouldn't want to miss any of it. It takes attention and multiple viewings to take it all in,... again that's a really fantastic thing.  Buy this! ...You simply can't go wrong.

B006ANJ4BW|2.0|Movie was just O.K. My wife and I had to watch the original after this just to bring our spirits back up.  New movies like this, the hero always succeed with no strife and everything goes his way, no moments of feeling utter defeat.  With the original you at least felt that the Arnold Conan had to work hard to learn what is best in life \\"To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like this app, but some of the mini games could have better controls. its worth downloading! :) its going to take me a while to get the third level games Cu's i suck :) lol
B006JPS1OM|4.0|fun game on kindle fire. some clues are hard to pick up so keep trying. I had to clean out app storage to make room for this game.
1451627289|1.0|I am a Stephen King fan - I think I read all his books, some of them multiple times, but I could not even go past a quarter of this one before giving up.  The main character does not work: high school teacher that decides to change the past (on a whim apparently) and turns into a cold-blooded killer but also in a talented and sensitive drama director...and this just in the part I read.  King recycles Derry from `IT' - even putting a couple of its characters in this book, that is quite a cheap trick.  The depiction of late '50 - early '60 America is possibly the best part - but even this does not quite work, being a mix of nostalgia (how things tasted good then! how nice the people were!) with hard - and not so nice - facts: racism, pollution.  The two never quite merge; it seems that the hero is travelling in two different places (or times).   The secondary characters - often one of the best things in King's book - are over-done and weak: high-school start football player that discover his inner artist, tough-but-good school librarian that runs the place firmly-but-with-love - and dies tragically of cancer (second character that does that).  The action is slow, with a lot of repetition and asides that have nothing to do with the main plot and that are pretty boring.  And last but not least . . . why everyone that has a computer in recent King's books has a Mac..? Even small-town, small-business owners? Product placement?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not amazing but for a free game its worth the download. not all the games are but you cant expect anything to good for free.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|crappy games you get like 9 to start and have to unlock the test with points.  points cost money.  loads of forced ads between games.  the points I earn from games far below needed to unlock games.  uninstalled

B0054JZC6E|3.0|a good spin on simple games. in which you have to earn the newer simple games. none of the games are that great but you only need to play them for 30 seconds

B005KELQEU|5.0|I looked through all the cover products for the Kindle and I have to say that they were very pricey. I found this cover and it suits my needs and works perfect. I don't have to worry about anything and it fits in my purse perfectly. This was the cheaper cover and I love it.
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|decent movie.  the plot is pretty much the same.  its a good movie to sit down and not have to think about.  allows you to relax.  very unexpected ending however....makes the movie worth while.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this set of games has been quite interesting but could use some work. The controls are not very responsive. in some of the games.
0062082353|1.0|I'm surprised this douche didn't claim he personally killed OBL while acting as tooth fairy and Santa Clause in Packistan.  Burger King/Kris Kringle/mass killer/sucker punch and run extraordinaire\\" would not blink an eye if an American was in his cross hairs. He would murder you or me or his own momma in a heartbeat just to get the approval of his masters and another cup of rice. It's a sad commentary on Life that controversy even if it's a BALD FACE LIE sells books and the publicity stunts knows NO boundaries, People even MURDER to achieve Fame or Infamy is now. There are SO many Losers and just plain soulless cold hearted people in the World, many have to resort to unspeakable EVIL to make their fortunes in life; this is where people like Chris Kyle, Licensed Murderer comes in. The Evil is rampaging all over the Earth and it's Gov funded.  Another thing,,,, this crap reminds me MORE and MORE of a cross between germany dropping leaflets and transmitting radio \\"NEWS\\" they wish to INSTILL in every mind, during WWII, and the news on 1984. WHY do SO MANY people believe this stuff!!?? It is brainwashing....
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it was a good game I liked it because it was fun to launch all the birds at the pigs.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|I cheated and downloaded this album early because I could not possibly wait another 2 months for it to come out when I was waiting 4 years already. I rarely download things early or for free because of the morality of it, but I did however buy 2 copies as soon as I was able to.  I've had this album for quite a while now and feel I can safely review it.   The first time I listened to it, I started from track 1 and listened to the whole thing from start to finish. I recommend everyone do the same! This review however I think i'll put the songs in the order I enjoyed them and why. (Also!! 95% of people are going to disagree with me and my bitterness about the 2? singles so like always, make sure to judge everything for yourself!)  10/10 Track 6. Scaretale - Ok, I have to admit, I sat for an hour trying to decide if I liked Scaretale more than Last ride of the day. Scaretale won out just barely because it is so different. I do not like the creepy zombie kids reciting ring around the rosie in the beginning but what can you do. This song.. Can only be described as... Creepy, Epic, ROCK, insanely awesome, perfect. I feel I have to point out Anette's vocals in this song. If anyone ever doubted Anette, just listen to this song and how perfect she fits with this new sound. Marcos vocals fit perfect with her vocals, and they both fit perfectly with the music.   10/10 Track 11 Last Ride Of The Day - This is the Rockin Nightwish I grew to love. This is the song I would show all my friends first. Fast paced, heavy, catchy, IMO this should have been the Single of the CD  10/10 Track 4 Slow, Love, Slow - I know this is a concept album and honestly I have no clue what they are going for, but this song reminds me of like suit and tie 1920s detective (like roger rabbit or something) Maybe i've lost my mind but that's the feel I get from it.  8/10 Track 12 Song of Myself - This song would probably be my favorite on the whole album if they would have cut it off around the 7 min mark. I'm not a huge poetry fan especially not creepy perverted poetry. The music, sound, feel, everything about this song is insanely awesome until they start with the poem. \\"An old man gets naked and kisses a model doll in his attic\\" (SERIOUSLY WTF?) \\"when he finally comes his eyes are cascading\\" (ok honestly... WTF?) the poem then goes on to talk about a mangy dog who tries to attack the pervy old guy and instead of just kicking the dog like most of us would do, he states he wish he had his leg to spare. (at least he's a kind hearted old pervert) I would pay 10$ for a single of this song without the stupid 7 min long crappy poem at the end. This song would be 10/10 if not for the last half being a pervy creepy poem.  9/10 Track 8 Turn Loose the Mermaids - This is a softer song, It is very catchy and the lyrics are kind of cool. I feel it fits perfectly to calm down the epicness a little bit.  9/10 Track 13 Imaginaerum - This is an instrumental song that recaps the whole album playing bits and pieces you will recognize. A perfect way to end such an awesome release.  Tracks 1, 3, 7, 9, 10,    1.Taikatalvi: intro \\"song\\" kind of a song anyway. It is a nice way to start the album and to work its way in to storytime.  7/10 3.Ghost River: Heavy metal!!!!!!! this song is killer.  8/10 7.Arabesque: A nice instrumental that is placed perfectly for a small break in the middle of the album.  8/10 9.Rest Calm: Another solid song, very good, it is not as slow as its name would imply.  9/10 10.The Crow, The Owl And the Dove: This song feels different. I think Marco might have wrote it. It sure feels like he wrote it anyway. It reminds me of \\"The Islander\\" off of their Dark passion play album.  That leaves me with...  7/10 Track 2 Storytime - I like this song, I really do but I've only listened to it maybe 10 times and i'm already sick of it. It is not near as solid of a track as any of the others listed above IMO. I certainly wouldn't complain if it came on the radio or something though!  And finally..  7/10 Track 5 I Want my Tears back - I disliked this song before I ever heard it. (young Steven) would have ate this song up if I were 10-18 I have no doubt this would have been my favorite song on the album, however.. I'm 26. I very very rarely dislike a song because of the lyrics, but this song... First song i've ever disliked because of the title. I want my tears back just seems like something a pissed off 13 year old girl would say. ALL that aside when I actually listened to the song It had some really cool Celtic style instrumentals. It is so incredibly catchy, and the vocals are off the hook. If I ignored the lyrics and title It would probably be ranked still in the bottom 3. There are some awesome parts and I'm sure most people will love it but it is way to repetitive for my tastes.   I've had access to this album for almost 2 months now. Its release date here in America is in 2012 but I feel confident that it will be my favorite release in 2012. My only complaint about this album is this: if I put every song in the order I liked them, I would put the single (Storytime) in second to last, and the soon to be new single (I want my tears back) in last place. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy those songs I just feel they are repetitive and weak compared with the rest of this awesome album! I realize this might not be a direct complaint about the album itself, but that fact almost turned me off of this amazing new release completely. Oh yeah and the creepy poem in Song of Myself. That's a complaint too ;)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game....love all the detail...would like to play all day long if I could ...great job guys on the game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You know that feeling of sadness you get when you really like a TV show and want it to last forever and ever... but it just gets worst the longer they try to sustain the plotline... things are meant to come to an end. I just finished Mockingjy. I actually blew through the trilogy within 2 wesks which is no small feat for a working mom of young kids. There were a lot of negative reviews before I even read it, but I had to give it a chance. I felt it ended brilliantly.<br /><br />*********spoilers ahead<br /><br />There were definitely a lot of horrors and difficut scenes, and I hoped that Prim would stay alive but saw why she couldnt. Really she was too perfect for this world. The author gave Katniss the happiest ending she could have in the aftermath, while still driving home her War only hurts everyone and no one is safe concept. Unexpected, yet great ending especially with the surprise twist with Snows execution. Disregrd the glowig and negative reviews alike, make up your own mind. The mark of a great book is to have as much criticism as praises.
B0012GMVXU|5.0|Leonard Cohen / I'm Your Man:  Cohen has always been able to write fantastic songs but here he not only writes great stuff, he also sings them perfectly.  The `man in the shadows' persona is a perfect fit for these songs.  This is a Five Star album.
1612930875|5.0|Treasure Island is a wild, crazy-like story. I was always holding my breath and crossing my fingers on mostly every page. I was always scared for Jim, the boy who is the main character, and was always wishing him the best. Overall,  it was extremely exciting and I even reread it. Treasure Island is truly a classic.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|Lenny Kravitz / Greatest Hits:  Lenny knows how to create some very entertaining songs and this set has some of his best.  This also contains his fine cover of \\"American Woman\\".  Four Stars.
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham has never disappointed me with his books and The Litigators was no exception.  Absolutely loved it and found it hard to put down.  Being from Virginia, I love when there are references to places that I have visited or know about.  A MUST read for any John Grisham fan.
B000001FS3|5.0|U2 / The Joshua Tree:  A Masterpiece.  They made excellent albums before this one and they will make excellent albums after this one, but The Joshua Tree not only marks the high point of U2's music but marks a point in time for a generation.  This one obviously deserves a Sixth Star.

B000002GHH|5.0|John Hiatt / Bring The Family:  Bluesy, Rocking, and Folkie, this is a wonderful album in all the styles he uses.  This is the one album that ought to be in every music lover's collection, and it will no doubt lead you to getting more from this fine artist.<br /> Five Stars
B005I6EU7U|4.0|As the packaging states this product is 'made for the latest Kindle device', i suspect it is actually made for Kindle touch-as it fits my Kindle touch like a glove! It is SO NOT leather, the packaging says the product is made from a 'high quality Italian material.' The gold inlay design is already rubbing off and I have only had it an hour.<br /><br />The price is asking WAY too much, but as protecting my Kindle is a high priority and this does the job while looking cute I don't regret the purchase. This item would easily sell for, and is worth, around $25. However, it is very difficult to find a good price on an e-reader case.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Guns N Roses / Greatest Hits:  A collection of their best work plus some of their fillers, but since they self destructed so quickly, this is the best we can expect to get.  Four Stars
B0064T6LV8|5.0|fun. just like pinball games of old.  haven't played in years. fun app. I am sure people will like this.
B00026WU3M|4.0|Bob Dylan / Oh Mercy:  This is not one that ranks among his classics, but it is still a very good album.  \\"Political World\\" and \\"Everything is Broken\\" are great songs.  The rest of the album is well written but his performances of them seem too subdued for the material.  Those who believe that Dylan had abandoned his Christian beliefs after `shot of love' ought to listen more carefully to \\"What Good Am I\\", which is based on various New Testament verses.  Overall, a solid Four Star album.
0385535139|5.0|This was a gift for my Dad who is a John Grisham fan.  He really enjoyed it and finished it in about 3 days.  Although I have not yet read this one, he said it was very good and and a very easy read.
B000002MG1|5.0|R.E.M. / Automatic For The People:  The third great album they made for Warner Brother.  It was a Great album then, it is a Great album now.  I think all the moronic `one' and `two' star ratings were written as a joke by Andy Kaufman.<br />Five Stars
B006IGZWB2|2.0|I was very disappointed with the movie. Some of the more controversial things that were covered in the book were not even touched in the movie. Which made what was being done less remarkable. I think the book should be read by everyone.
B000002H5I|5.0|Tracy Chapman (self-titled): An amazing voice delivering strong lyrics and beautiful tunes in one of the best albums of the era.  This one is a true Masterpiece.  Five Stars

B000002LOE|5.0|R.E.M. / Out of Time:  Some will never forgive R.E.M. for leaving I.R.S. for Warner Brothers, but it is clear that their previous label was holding them back as this is the second Great album they have released under Warner Brothers.  This is a Five Star album.
B0063GORYU|4.0|quite enjoyable, and it gives lots of options to choose from.  I've wasted :-) lots of time and find it one of the best solitaire games around.
B000002LFU|5.0|R.E.M. / Green:  R.E.M. emerges from their I.R.S. stint to create a great album with the help of a proper studio.  This is a classic Five Star album.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I downloaded this for the Kindle Fire and quite like it. It is just a bunch of mini games put together. (Sudoku, Archery, Snake, etc.) You play for coins which allow you to &quot;buy&quot; other games. There are also ways to get bonus coins which you discover after playing for a bit. The only flaw that I found frustrating is the instructions are sometimes oversimplified and it makes playing the games somewhat like putting together a bookshelf and the directions are in another language. Overall, it is worth the download.
B000002MFE|5.0|Eric Clapton / Unplugged:  Eric with acoustic guitar runs through old hits and old blues plus his touching version of Tears of Heaven.  This is an essential Clapton CD.  Five Stars.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I was sad after The Wire ended it's run. I was convinced that no television program would ever match it's quality.  I was wrong.   Breaking Bad is everything one could hope for in a pitch perfect television show. The acting, directing, cinematography, writing, all bundled in an amazing package that seems to get better each year. Midway through season 4, I was slightly disappointed with the slow pace, but then I was reminded about it's deliberate nature. This show builds suspense like nothing I've ever seen, shifting gears midway through the season, and never letting up after. The writing is undeniably superb, from simple dialogue to large story arcs and cliff hangers, everything feels right and not forced. There is no important plot element undiscovered, no loose ends left untied, no one dimensional extra characters or scenes that do not serve a purpose of moving the story along.   Acting, especially from the leads, is Oscar worthy to say the least. Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito definitely deserve all the praise they get, but Bryan Cranston's work here is incredible and unforgettable. It's one of those performances that will stay etched into your memory. He's just as good, if not better, during quiet, subtle scenes as he is when he puts on his crazy, delusional and genius Heisenberg persona.   Don't get me started on the film making: vast, beautiful landscapes serve as backdrops to some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. There are no wasted frames in Breaking Bad, it uses light and color elegantly to balance the mood and tension in each scene, there are plenty of long continuous takes for maximum immersion, with each season taking on it's own identity in terms of it's style in film making.   I'd like to thank Vince Gilligan for giving us this show and everyone else involved as well. Although I'm sad about Season 5 being the last one, part of me is glad that there is an ending planned, I have no doubt it will be incredible.
B000P0J024|5.0|The Traveling Wilburys / Collection (2 CD/1 DVD): You don't have this set?  Maybe it's been so long since this band disbanded that you've never heard of it.  Maybe its been so long ago that you have forgotten that it existed.  Whatever the reason, you ought to have this Great set.  This is as super as any super-group has been.  Maybe they don't get the credit they deserve because it all sounds like too much FUN to be taken seriously?  Well, don't let this one pass you by.  This is a GREAT set.  Five Stars.
B001GF8WPI|5.0|This is NOT your typical Will Ferrell movie. In all ways, this is a good thing. For those who aren't Will Ferrell fans, you'll be pleased to know that this tale is intelligently crafted and well thought out. It isn't an action fest, so if you're looking for such a flick, your time is better spent elsewhere, but it is a touching movie of humanity and courage.<br /><br />As the title says, I can't really elaborate more than what's already been posted, but I'm hoping that this review will help those searching for a movie with an emotional impact, that leads to meaningful introspection, in a way that few contemporary movies do.
B004LWZVZM|5.0|Had seen the movie in theaters and loved it.  Was delighted when it came out on Blu-ray, so ordered it.  The movie arrived promptly and in perfect condition.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|I own this for more than two months and so far is a great HTPC. I will recommend friend to buy this barebone.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This was a long-time family favorite movie, so we wanted to have the special edition.  It did not disappoint!  We watched it Christmas morning for old times sake.  Our only complaint is that this new edition did not include the full version of Scrooge being told by his fiancee that she was ending their engagement (with the related song).  The DVD arrived promptly and in good condition.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my only complaint is that I cant install any of the games for the free coins on my kindle fire. I unlocked and best the first set of games really quickly, and now I'm impatiently trying to get enough to unlock the last game on the second level.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I loved every moment. Realistic. Never knew so much abot trains, frieght or otherwise. Thank you Tony Scott!<br />All the acting is outstanding. And I am a sucker for a happy ending.
0307352145|4.0|In a noisy, garrulous world, author Susan Cain asks us to quietly contemplate those who do the quiet contemplation.  The book's biggest surprise is the enormous amount of experimental research that has been conducted over the last few decades that sheds light on various aspects of introversion, extroversion, relationships, thinking, remembering, reacting, and so on.  Ms. Cain also points out how the extrovert ideal has hijacked society and was a primary contributor to the worldwide financial collapse of 2008.  The outgoing optimists could not forsee any future difficulties in their trading, while quiet people in those same companies foretold doom and were either ignored, transferred, or terminated.  'Quiet' covers a spectrum of personalities and tendencies and is recommended reading for anyone with a studious nature, child, or partner; Cain points out that there is nothing wrong with us, we are not antisocial, merely \\"differently social.\\"
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Very fast and accurate service from seller. This is exactly what I needed to help my round of golf. If you want to decrease your golf shots, I highly recommend one.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|Downloaded and installed this APP for free from Amazon.  Numerous times it caused my phone to freeze.  I had to remove & reinsert the battery to reset my phone (LG Thrill).  The first time I figured was a fluke. After two more times within the fist 48 hours I uninstalled it.  Not recommended, at least for this model of phone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is pretty fun, with levels that vary in how hard they are. It will take a while to get bored with so many different levels. haha
B004GYY714|5.0|Oddly enough, the stereo in my bedroom cannot get a strong radio connection, but now I don't have to worry about it since I have this awesome app. I just connect my Kindle to my stereo and then tune into my favorite local stations. I also like that it can run in the background while I use my Kindle to surf the internet or use other apps.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I cannot review this product as I bought it as a gift for my son-in-law, but he was absolutely thrilled.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|:) this game is.fantastic the fun.never stops and.it.explains.how to play every game hay!!! you must get it you will not regret it.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Glad this was a freebie.  Samsung Exhibit II is what I own, and three of the first games tried gave me stark white screens during play and then force close messages.  Uninstalled.
B002PJN59M|5.0|Dont be fooled by reading these 5 star reviews! The sets are in somebodys back yard, the armor is made from Reynolds wrap and the sound effects were made by the same Foley artist that first used coconuts for hoof sounds. Really, dont throw away 2 hours on this mess<br />ZAP
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Why is everyone complaining? Cause its free or cause you have to earn your extended games?  The challenge comes with playing to earn more games,  if your a lazy person who wants an easy to win, fast finish game, don't download this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun app for a very quick game session, which is nice when you get a few minutes of relaxation from housework and kids.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app to have. I have really enjoyed reading the Bible and listening to it aswell. This is a must have app for everyone.
0061689246|5.0|I saw the movie and my girlfriend had me read the book.  I have to say it adds to the movie and if you haven't seen the movie it will add to the book (namely Robert de Niro, claire danes, and Michelle Pfeiffer).
0765350386|2.0|SPOILER ALERT  This was a good book up until the perposterous ending.  So your whole plan relies on getting yourself killed and creating a religion that will cause an uprising, all within one day?  Are you kidding me? Come on man!  There are just so many flaws in relying on such a farfetched plan that concludes this story.  The heroine is also pretty stupid, goes back to the castle where she knows the inquisitors are going to be waiting to capture her, real smart.  No way I can give Mistborn 5 stars, too bad.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Compared to the other friends-with-benefits-type movie that came out the same year, this one beats it by 100%. The story line is much funnier, more creative, and a lot sexier. Mila Kunis is always funny, but I was surprised with Justin Timberlake's performance (I've never seen him in a comedy): very funny. Kunis and Timberlake are great together and this movie is hilarious!
B004EPYZU8|2.0|If you want to watch a movie that lasts a very long time (110 minutes; a little shy of two hours)...and then have a lot of extra time on your hands trying to figure out what you've just watched, then \\"Sucker Punch\\" is the one for you.  I personally didn't care for it, but then, I saw the EXTREMELY BUTCHERED PG-13 version.  You could tell it had been cut all to pieces because of a lot of the scenes just didn't connect, and there was actually no flow at all to the movie.  I don't know if the producer(s) of this film decided he would make a lot more bank on a PG-13 version.  What he did in making that decision was deprive the viewer of what could have been a really different kind of story.<br /><br />The main character of Babydoll is played by Emily Browning.  She's taken to a psychiatric hospital...but, then, she's not really.  You see, EVERYTHING in this movie is a metaphor.  Anyway, while there she is made to \\"dance\\" as part of her, uh, therapy.  Seems she can really shake a tail feather because EVERYBODY'S gaga for Babydoll.  Trouble is, we never get to see her \\"bump-n-grind.\\"  And while she's performing, she has visions--and they ain't of sugarplumbs dancing in her head.  Scott Glenn was horribly miscast as the \\"Wise Man.\\"  Babydoll is first introduced to him while performing her first dance.  She then does batlle with Japanese mythical giant monsters and when her battle is over, so is her \\"dance.\\"<br /><br />I did like the soundtrack.  Bjork's \\"Army of Me\\" is almost worth the price of the movie alone!  However, I just didn't connect with the rest of the movie or the characters.  I won't completely pan this one, but it didn't work for me.  Perhaps it might for you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I truly love this Bible app. it has multiple study plans, reads the Bible to you, multiple transions are available so you can read a passage in different translations and get a better understanding of what the verses mean.  It is almost impossible to find a free version of the NIV. It is included with other translations in this free app. At least it was free when I got it. Easily worth $9.99 to $14.99 as a paid app.   I am a retired Minister &amp; I love this app. I wish I had it when I was actively preaching!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|very cute and fun can waste a lot of time getting them all unlocked. At least it is a goal I am trying
0670022411|5.0|While I do not have time for a full review, I felt I needed to put in my two cents. A highly engaging and interesting book! Not my usual fare -- vampires and such are not my thing. I very much look forward to this author's next book.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|This is another great show from JJ Abrams. Good cast, interesting episodes that also tie into a larger theme, and good writing. The production value is very very good (which may result in the show being cancelled at some point, as it is very expensive for the studio to produce). If you are watching this in HD with great speakers, you are in for an experience.   I highly recommend this show. You don't have to be interested in science fiction to appreciate it, although paranormal events are a common theme.   The first 5 or 6 episodes of Season 1 are good, but in my opinion don't suck the viewer in. However, once you get to the 6th or 7th episode, get ready to be hooked. This is a very good show, and you probably noticed the great reviews from everyone else.   The later seasons are very good as well, and each season turns the previous season on its head.   If you are looking for a good show, give Fringe a try. You won't be disappointed.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Product was in mint condition when it arrived. Came to my house earlier than expected. I was very happy with this product and didn't have to worry about not getting it in time for christmas.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is an easy and fun game. you are able to re-deal if you are not doing well. I did have s video pop up on my kindle while playing which was a bit annoying.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a very cool app it has some weird apps one of the coolest apps ever. you like it you cool see ya later
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really like the reading plans, and being able to compare the different versions to get better understanding. It would be nice if this sent a daily alert to my device, because I often forget to open the app to do my daily reading.
0307891402|5.0|The hardcover Skyrim guide is fantastic.  The amount of content that is in this guide is astounding.  The pages are full color and of good quality.  There was an edit of the original guide (as I have version 2) in which all of the complaints that I have read from other reviews seem to be addressed.  The guide now warns of potential spoilers before reading quest details, has a much improved index, and is apparently spelling mistake free (as I have not run into any errors).  I would recommend this guide to anyone as a supplement to the game.  Can you get through the game without it?  Sure you can, but being able to confirm that yes, your spells are less effective v. this enemy or no, it doesn't matter if you kill random travelers on the road is very helpful.  The crafting sections are also useful as it list necessary materials as well as the effects of all alchemy ingredients.  Condensed version:   Definitely buy this guide.  Not only is it very helpful, but it looks amazing to boot.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Downloaded this app and LOVE it!  Smooth gameplay and great graphics. Played it multiple times with no problems whatsoever. Just a heads up for those complaining about the players 'jumping in', etc. check the settings prior to playing and you will find this option can be disabled. Enjoy!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|l love spider solitaire and love to challenge. myself at the highest 4 suit level.  I am glad that I can play on my kindle fire.
B0063GORYU|4.0|great game -- I would enjoy it more if it had the option for a winning deal.  very user friendly
B0053O89KG|5.0|great actors, awesome storyline, and funny, if you havent given this show a try you are missing out! love it
B004XNGKBS|4.0|Tested on Google Nexus S phone. I like how the app takes a section of handwriting and moves it onto the \\"document\\" in lines.  Makes it easy to write text large (as you must on a touch screen) and still be able to see a long section of text that you have previously written. Drawing detailed figures is problematic as they also are treated the same way and squished down to fit into one of the lines in the document.  Still, for taking lengthy notes with handwriting, even on a smaller device, tagging them, sharing them (even to evernote, which is perfect for me), this seems usable and smartly put together.    My main request for improved functions would be some way of going into a drawing mode where detailed drawings would not get reduced so much in size as the text does.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Great product, good timeing, great seller...good doing business with you...thanx a bunch!!  I recomend working with this person without question.  Have a good day and sell sell sell!
B005GVA2L0|1.0|I really wanted to like this, but I am so disappointed.  After waiting for years, it sounds so commercial.  And, while I don't understand a continued feud between Evanescence and We Are The Fallen, I have to say that I like their sound better.  I like Amy's voice a lot, but get back to your roots and what made you guys great.  This isn't it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and good games. not overdone or overly complicated. can be played by just about anyone. plus it is free which is.the best.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|game worked great with no issues really... didn't like the pop ups. but that's the price of free game play.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|When i first heard this i was abominated.... It sounded like the force has been captured in my ears. Order this you will...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is sweet. I can play forever and never get bored. my four year old loves playing these and there's so many to choose from she doesn't get bored.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this app pushes ads into your notification panel... even when the app is closed... not cool... not cool at all!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the games, something to keep me busy. I think its a nice free app to even if you just want topazes time by.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy to see the info you want.  Video is simple and localized. Does not show last known info if not connected to wi-fi.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great and awesome. Keeps you entertained for hours and is has unique games that keep you interested. This app is a must get.
1401309666|3.0|It is supremely ironic that there is no e-version of this book!  This book deals with an internet topic, and I want to read it on my Kindle.  Do I have to succumb and purchase a paperback?
B005K2YTG4|5.0|I have a Kindle Touch and this sleeve looks great. It fits in there well and the sleeve isn't really bulky. I really like the colors too. The blue is very bright and true to the photo. The product came with in a couple days of me ordering it and has worked great!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is one of the best apps ive had in a while it works really good on the kindle fire. I &lt;3 it
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This cd is going to be a classic!  The first two recordings \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" and \\"Rumor\\" has it\\"...Had me dancing in the kitchen while cleaning up a big mess in the kitchen from a holiday gathering. I was so exhausted, but came to life instantly! I must have played these two songs over 10 times! Even my \\"miniature poodle puppy was dancing on his \\"hind legs!!\\"....Though the whole cd is \\"Totally AWESOME\\", I wish there were \\"more\\" songs with this tempo . Great, club songs or for a \\"at home gathering\\"  OMG! SO, so HOT!...My first time listening to this gal. She is so \\"soulful\\"....PLEASE, please do yourself a favor and purchase this CD...I think its \\"much better than her first\\", which, I  then got on Amazon.com and listened to samples after loving \\"21\\"...ADELE, if YOU ARE READING THESE REVIEWS, please, more of this kind of rockin' tempo , sultry music!! Money \\"well\\" spent...Not a bad song on the whole cd.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Product as described; new, wrapped in cellophane. Perfect for the Sean Connery fan and his collection. Would highly recommend to all.
B003BW0CB6|1.0|I wish we had a saying for a book like they have for movies...ya know...straight to video.  Actually that would be too kind...this book is straight to trash. I have read thousands of books and this one rates at the bottom.  Normally I love reading pulp fiction on holidays when I have nothing to do but drink a pina colada and turn pages.  This book is just a thief of time but in a really bad, horrible way.    The story is so weak as well as the the pathetic twist at the end.  I'm sorry that's not a climax but just a lame way of writing yourself out of a poorly written novel that never had a story to begin with.    I normally recycle books I buy back into the fold but this one I litterly threw into the trash where it belongs.  I will never get the time back I spent reading this book...it's so bad I would have rather spent the time writing this horrible review for myself to read so I wouldn't read this lousy book.
B001HN6922|5.0|Product as described; new, wrapped in cellophane. Perfect for the Cars and Pixar fans and their collection. Would highly recommend to all.
0316067598|5.0|Great book to read, had trouble putting it down!  I have lent to friends who complained of bad writing (grammer, choice of words), but i never noticed???  A book to read, put on your bookshelf, and read a few years later for a second time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it's a great app. super easy to use and intuitive. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a weather app.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|Very good movie.  My wife and I enjoyed it very much.  She read the book a while back and thought that for the most part the movie followed the book well.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my fave card game... very addictive and a great way to pass the time... :)  You wont be disappointed.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|If you are tired of computer enhanced voices jamming the airwaves this is one CD to own.  Adele's voice is beautiful, true and touches your soul.  I loved her first CD (Adele 19) and thought it would be tough to top but this CD surpassed my expectations.  It's hard to believe she is only 21 yrs. old! Sit back with a nice glass of wine and just revel in the beauty of her voice and the stories she so eloquently tells through it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is wonderful and awesome. I love all of the game choices this game has to offer. I love this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun with lots of simple and some difficult games plenty to keep u entertained for hours and hrs
B005WZZRD8|5.0|I love this item. It looks great and is very professionally done. I bought this because I wanted The Madison Square Gardens live performance and the Born This Way album, so it turned out a win-win situation with the price. The live performance was taped and edited very well. I especially liked the So Happy I Could Die performance. The madison Square Gardens is one cd and in it's little paper case, it includes a photo gallery as well as the songs she sings in order. Other than the live singing, the cd also includes backstage footage which was fun to watch, and Born This Way acappella. The Born This Way album also includes The Remix compilation, as well as the lyrics to all the songs.<br /><br />I read in a different review here that the little cardboard box the 3 cds are kept in is bad quality. If you have The Fame Monster limited edition usb stick with that flimsy box, you'll see this is a huge improvement.<br /><br />If you are a Lady Gaga fan, this is a must have item. Buy it now or be sorry later.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Glad I didn't have to pay for it, refuses to install on my Impressions 7\\" tablet.  Though I would really really like to try this product...
145551389X|3.0|I am a enormous Gaga fan and I was really looking forward to this book. I still like it very much, but I was a little disappointed. I love the fact that the pictures are totally random, but I did expect them to be professionally taken by Terry Richardson. I must compliment Terry for capturing Gaga raw in her everyday life although at most 10% of the pictures look like they where thought out (like the one where Gaga is eating pasta, or the one where she is looking down the balcony with a cigarette, and the one with her hand sticking out of the water, or even the few black-and-white close-ups of her face) while the rest have people and hands in the way, or Gaga is just brushing her teeth, which makes it more relatable and is fun to page through, but there was no point in getting a professional photographer to do this job. It also makes me wonder who is taking the pictures when half of them include Terry Richardson...  On the other hand, all the pictures are very good quality, and totally exclusive to the book. The quality of the book and binding is very high too. As I said in my title, nobody is going to study or look closely at any of these pictures, since most of them could be taken by me or you or any random homeless guy as long as he knows how to use a camera. I still recommend this book to Gaga fans, but not if you want to see well taken pictures. If you are tight for money, I suggest you get [[ASIN:B005WZZRD8 Born This Way - The Collection [2 CD / DVD Combo]]] instead, because it is much more enjoyable and practical, since this book weighs a ton  If Amazon would allow it, I would give it 3.5/5, but 3/5 it is :)
B000068PQ0|5.0|I simply adore this album; it is one of my favorite albums in the world and I think it's a work of genius.<br /><br />It's not just the music, which is wonderful. This album is a philosophy major's dream--it deals with existential questions about what is real and how do you know what is real (One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21); ontological questions about the nature of what we feel (The Morning of the Magicians), and how to deal with those things that we feel; the powerful and beautiful \\"Do You Realize\\" is an existential musical exegesis about how crazy and daunting and overwhelming and sad and beautiful and confusing and inspiring our reality is; and the nature of being (All We Have Is Now).<br /><br />There is more. I listen to the album again and I feel different things. That's what's so wonderful about this album--it's like a book that you love and reread, and every time you do you discover somthing new.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Perfect for offline use and unlike the Oxford dictionary that comes with the kindle fire, you can look up words easily without waiting forever, only to find that you're looking up references, not the definition of the actual word itself.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|This cover is just okay, it does protect the screen. The front part that is supposed to prop the Fire up is pretty useless not very sturdy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game for your kids &amp; adults too. I got it for my kids, but I find myself playing it as well!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I was looking for a free game and I looked at this and I found it is really fun. as u go through levels the price to unlock them gets higher. all in all it is worth downlowading.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun up until the games that are next to impossible to beat then u cant play anymore. other then that good game
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this is the best alarm app I've had on any of my android based phones. I really.like all the customizable options for each alarm you set
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Those other people whining about how many ads there are and complaining about how you have to unlock other games need to shut up. That's what it says before you get the app. But about the game, its pretty good to waste some time when you're bored.
B000MV9026|1.0|i got the widescreen edition, not full screen like the product says. i absolutely hate widescreen. i don't even know why they invented widescreen in the first place. I ordered full screen because i thought i was going to get full screen. nope they send me WIDESCREEN!! fix your description on the product!!!!! now!!!!!!!  1/5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a few where you drag the response time is slow but overall pretty decent. I mainly play one game sudoku since its not repetitious.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. Easy to use. Love the audio versions that are included. One  of my favorites and they  are always making it better.
0307595579|5.0|Great reading....Girl with the dragon tatoo is way better than the movie....what fabulous writing! Our whole family is enjoying these books.
B005JZBP8W|4.0|I've owned this movie on VHS and DVD, and the Blu-ray disc is by far the best version (for home viewing) so far (bought for my daughter, Eliza).<br /><br />I wish there were options to hear Audrey's singing voice in the context of the movie and more songs with Audrey's voice in the special features (no matter how inferier), so I deducted one star for that.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have always had a hard time reading the Bible everyday until I found this APP.  It works great and is easy to set up.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|I find that I can't stand my kindle up like i'm suppose too. It keeps falling over, doesn't stay up. It is a nice cover though. I was hoping I could put it down while reading but I can't.
B003XRDYX2|5.0|I sent this to my Dad in Kuwait as a Christmas present he had been wanting. He loved it, he has always been a Bob Dylan fan so this went nicely with the rest of his collection.
0307592731|5.0|\\"Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail\\" is the amazingly honest, heart-felt memoir of Cheryl Strayed's 1,100-mile solo hike on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State. It's also about her painful early life. Her abusive father left when she was six. Her mother died when she was twenty two. Her stepfather morphed from a person she considered her dad into a man she occasionally recognized. Her two siblings scattered in their grief as her marriage unraveled until she gave up and scattered as well.<br />With little experience as a long-distance hiker and the trail little more than an idea, \\"vague and outlandish and full of promise\\" she pieces back together a life that had come undone.<br />Her challenges included carrying a pack that weighed more than half her weight, blistered feet and loss of toenails, embarrassment about being broke, enduring extreme hunger, thirst, heat and cold and hiking on a narrow ridge in deep snow. ( She had to skip over four hundred miles as the trail was impassable because of the record snow.)<br />Cheryl laughed when her trail friends (\\"Three Young Bucks\\") named her \\"The Queen of the PCT\\" because people always wanted to give her things and did not do anything for them. She realized then, except for two creepy experiences, the world had opened their arms to her at every turn.<br />Sitting near the \\"Bridge of Gods\\" at the end of her hike she mused about all the trail had taught her and everything she couldn't yet know; that in four years she'd cross this bridge with another man and marry him and they would have a son and daughter.<br />Told with wit and wisdom Cheryl's book \\"Wild\\" is an unforgettable, inspiring story about her early life's challenges, her adventures and misadventures and the incredible beauty and spirit of the American West.<br />Her extraordinary story and writing is so poetic and vivid I laughed and cried and could not put the book down.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is an enjoyable game for anyone to operate! The music is low key and relaxing! No screaming graphics, no blinking lights or distractions. There is an old fashioned feel to this game that keeps it entertainingly fun without too many distractions. What you see is what you get.  And that is all you need for this thinking game!!
B0057R5XRG|3.0|The product was delivered on time and in good shape as far as packaging.  There was one technical problem with the third DVD however and a replacement had to be ordered.  Amazon will take care of this per their response.  Thanks.
B004P7CN5O|5.0|I saw bits and pieces of this movie on HBO now and again. Couldn't wait to watch it from beginning till the end..... once I received it from Amazon. I watched it with my hubby. Neither one of us watched it from the beginning till the end before. All I can say about this movie is it is gross...lol. But that's not a bad thing to me. It kind if reminds me of Fright Night, because of the way the Vampires look when they transform. This movie is not for everyone. You might want to rent it first.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The Help is a fabulous story that everyone should see! Really makes you think and you really connect with the characters in the story.
078322799X|5.0|This movie isn't scary. This movie is just enjoyable to me. I use to catch it on tv now and again. Knowing how much I enjoy watching this movie my hubby bought it for me for Christmas one year. My favorit parts are when the movie goes threw a flash back in the hospital. When John and Patrisha are going threw a killing spree.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Ok, so there are ads but who cares it takes 2 seconds to get back to playing. This is great for killing time or entertaining drunk people.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|This app is chock full of games and ads. The games are passable; nothing special about any that I played. Usually there is a fair amount of luck (rather than skill) to &quot;beating&quot; a game, which is generally achieving a score within a time limit in what would otherwise be an endless game. Your scores add to your credit which you use to unlock more games, all of which seem to be nothing more than 'okay'. You can also install apps for credit or purchase credits.  Overall, the ads are a little annoying but they are expected. It's free and its an okay time waster as long as you don't expect too much.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for my 5 year old...he loves playing and trying go get higher scores...good to pass time and keep yourself entertained.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Super sampling of her haunting vocal talents.  Really different (for a change), with a blend of jazz and classic rock.  However, it's hard to watch and listen to \\"Rehab\\" without wondering what if.  And so it goes....
B000I0QK74|5.0|James Taylor's voice takes me back to the 70's. A peaceful and comfortable soundtrack for the Christmas Season. Sweet Baby James!
B002WJI65S|5.0|Got this for our four year old son, along with a few other plush mario characters, and he LOVES them! Goomba is cute, although it looks like the eye brows may fall off after vigorous playtime, but for now my kiddo loves these things!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun so far! Just started playing. It took me a while to figure it out. I have not had any problems yet. Hopefully my experience will stay positive.
1933633867|2.0|The problem with the field of economics is that it is so huge no one individual can master it.  Additionally, it is not amenable to the experimental method.  Many professional economists agree that it is not a science (read Russ Roberts).  So, the conclusions economists come to are determined by which data sets they study.  Dr. Graeber has his data sets other economists have theirs and thus the conclusions are contradictory.  Dr. Graeber has strong anarchist and socialist biases and so is it any wonder that his conclusions are radical.  I finished the book but I don't know why, a futile hope that it would get better?  The only parts really worth reading are the essays on the historical uses of debt in different cultures, that was good.  The rest is mostly speculative babble meant for philosophers who wish to debate the fundamental laws of the universe.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I never leave home without checking the always up to date weather.  Wind reports are right on the money. Great application.  Thank you.
B0063IH60K|4.0|passes the time, especially when waiting- at the doctors, the airport, etc. graphics are simple but easy to c. very User friendly.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I would be so lost without evernote: its amazing!<br />with 4 devices that I go between its such a relief to know that I wont loose a single thought.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app works well for me. I have yet to see anything wrong with this app. easy lookup of Bible verses.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I have always had trouble falling asleep...until now. This sounds are so amazing on my Kindle Fire.  There are so many unique sounds to choose from and many standard relaxing ones as well.  I was truly amazed at how easily the thunderstorm has been putting me to sleep.  This app has been a true blessing!!  Well worth the money.
B00006JLX4|5.0|Some of Pavement's ultimate work. I love the B sides of their many songs, it offers a new take on some of my favorites. The main reason I bought this CD was because of the artwork. This whole CD is a piece of art!
1401308201|5.0|I've seen the broadway twice and it brings back the greatest memories. This book is perfect for all who love the timeless wicked musical, and for those who love wizard of oz and want to know a different story. It's not necassarily about the tale, but how the musical was brought to life. The pictures are beautiful and there is even the original song \\"sketches\\". It HAS a spoiler alert, so I would be careful.
B00004VYPF|1.0|Bought this impulsively, and didn't notice that this is the French version of the movie and not in English. Now I'm trying to return the movie to the European distributor.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Really like this DVD workout, exercises are simple and don't require much equipment.  Another bonus is that she has someone demonstrating an easier and harder versions of each exercise.  Each workout is only 20 minutes but you will feel it the next day!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app you can choose which version you want which is so brest and you can easily look up which verse you want to read.I say download this app I highly recommend this app plus you can share the Bible verses on facebook or twitter
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Good variety of games, but the near-constant interruption of ads is extremely annoying. Most games are fun and easy enough to get minimum points to unlock more games.  Good free app.
B005XT3PZK|4.0|I was afraid that when I bought this that I'd only be able to play it othe mp3 cloud thing from amazon but was pleased to find that I could save it to my computer and make a cd for a secrecy Santa gift! Very happy with the result
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is okay nut they want you do buy points and or do offers to unlock more games. if you don't it will take a long time to unlock the other games
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun when bored gets kinds annoying after awhile horrible after the update had to delete then reinstall and some of the games are impossible
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play solitaire to keep my mind alert.  I have played many versions and have played for over 50 years.  l had an aunt who kept score of how many times she beat Sol.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's solitaire, it's the simple card game that most should know. Even better it's not over done, runs nice and smooth.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Love how the description states that &quot;the rest are unlocked and you have to unlock them.&quot; :p check your grammar, people:p   Not bad.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it has annoying ads but the games are awesome and addicting. takes up a little extra storage than others but definatly worth it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I was connected to my home wifi network, and yet was still unable to complete the download that they advise wifi for it. I am totally in love with the game otherwise and wanted to play it on my new android tablet versus my tiny phone screen. please get this addressed and I will be happy to give a better review and purchase this game.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This game is great, and I love it. It is lots of fun, and a great activity for when your bored:)
0525423656|3.0|This book in my opinion was not nearly as engaging as Matched. Granted I realize it's a love story for teens but I got so tired of hearing how their hearts ached, his rough cut hands holding hers, etc etc. I loved the symbolic color codes of Matched that left me wanting to re-read and analyze and I feel that Crossed had little of. Also the plot really didn't progress that much and Xander was barely in the book. I feel betrayed as the reader bc Matched sucked me in as a reader, Crossed let me down, but I'll probably read the third bc I am already invested. blech...
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This app would have been really good except for the push notifications. I don't normally review apps too often, but these notifications are making me do it! I hate these kinds of games!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Amazing!!!! Love this product just dont like that i have to wright this review just so it will stop asking me to review it thx
B0057ZAA0S|5.0|Es una de las peliculas mas perronas q he visto acerca de las drogas y la autodestruccion humana, ademas el soundtrack de la pelicula esta muy recomendable
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is one of the best weather apps I have seen. love it!!! this app deserves all of its great ratings.
B005HSL626|5.0|I like this game because it is really fun and it keeps you busy and it is FREE it is a great fun free game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|his is so intertaning and is the best game ever, I would tell anyone about this game cuz its so fun!!
B004UID2LC|1.0|You might as well just go on youtube instead of getting this app. It may work better on other things but on my kindle fire it is terrible. Wish I didn't download it. Waste of space.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds is a physics puzzle game where you launch different birds at pigs whom stole your eggs. Only complaint is the ads but that's what ya get for a free game.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|We bought this for my brother-in-law and he loved it!!! Super stoked about the price and the quality. Couldn't ask for better.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the darts game the best but there are many others that some might find rather appealing. another game that I thought was enjoyable and funny was sky diving a little word of advice read the instructions for each game sometimes it can get sketchy if you don't
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is the first app of this kind that I've used and it works great. I have a thunderbolt and no issues at all!
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I breakthrough this app out whenever I have homework assigned to me in school. and it works. ill look at it and it will update and tell me when I have homework due. it works for me at least
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I wouldn't say this is perfect, but it is a very good task tracker for me right now. I had been using Informant, but the bugginess of the Google sync and its other ecentricities (cluttered screens, quirkiness, etc.) eventually put me off using it every day. This is a simple and sleek interface that does what I need. I like to keep track of my daily Todos list and check off anything I complete each day and move things over to the next day (or delete them) when things slip (similar to Franklin Covey). The interface makes that pretty easy to do.  If you are looking for feature parity with Google Tasks, that is not what this does. I use the sync to keep my task lists up to date on my different devices, that is all.  The developer is responsive and fixed both errors I noticed when I originally picked up the app for free last week (32 days in January due to the leap year being applied to the wrong month and a problem with 2-step verification when setting up sync).  I am not giving this 5 stars only because a widget would be nice to have and it doesn't quite have all the features I would like, e.g., task dependencies, comments on my tasks, and sometimes subtasks would be nice.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so awesome it is really fun and good for wasting time this game is one of the best games I came across in awhile
142311339X|5.0|The Lost Hero (Heroes of Olympus, Book 1) is a great follow-up series to the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. Old characters from the first series meet new characters on fun, wild, and sometimes scary adventures. Rick Riordan definitely hasn't lost his touch when it comes to creating interesting books to keep you entertained, especially if you are a fan of Greek mythology as I am! Definitely another winner from Riordan.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|for anyone looking to have a relationship with God or a better relationship with God, this is the bible for you. This Bible leaves you without excuse.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good fun for free app would recommend this for a quick time waster to anyone. thanks amazon! love my kindle
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is addictive and super fun. Free downloads do not get any better than this. Have not had any problems with this app except to stop playing it.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|IT IS TERRIBLE I TAKES DO LONG TO LOAD SND IT NEEDS MORE LEVELS BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD
0399226907|5.0|Every new parent should include this book in his or her home library.  Make sure to buy the boardbook version because kids love to poke their fingers through the little caterpillar holes and touch everything that gets eaten.  Great gift for new parents.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|This is a great app for my Kindle but it times out in the middle of the game.  This needs to be fixed to receive a higher rating.
0685054667|5.0|I adore Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl and have read it multiple times over the years. Anne's diary has come to mean different things to me as I've grown older - when I first read it as a ten-year-old girl, I was fascinated by the hidden life she led with her family and there was a sense of dread and excitement about her precarious circumstances, the danger of being discovered. When I read Anne's diary again as a teenager, I came to empathize with Anne's frustrations with her mother and the other adults around her whom Anne felt did not understand her and treated her as a child. I felt Anne's desire to be 'heard' and not just treated as an inconvenience or child was so much aligned with what I was going through during adolescence.<br /><br />When I re-read the diary as an adult, I came to appreciate all the other things - the tragedy of having lost such an amazing and talented young voice in the most horrible of circumstances; the beauty of Anne's writing which is all the more amazing given how young she was when she wrote this diary; and the themes of alienation, fear, and hope. Now, as the mother of a young daughter, I read this diary again and gain another fresh perspective - of the complex relationship between daughter and mother. Anne had a strained relationship with her mother Edith, and clearly gravitated toward her beloved Pim (father). This was obvious even before Anne and her family were compelled to move into hiding in the Annex. As a mother, reading Anne's thoughts about her mother (often unflattering) was a disconcerting experience, though things do improve somewhat later on.<br /><br />Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl is a classic not only of Holocaust literature, but also a classic Young Adult read with its myriad themes that will appeal to both adolescents and adult readers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is a fantastic way to kill time! while I admit the games are quite corny they still provide some level of amusement.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|So I recently bought this and I love how the score was done in the movie and so I decided to buy this. Plus I needed Superman to have a theme song in my wrestling games for my XBOX 360. So obviously I needed to buy this. Why did I choose Superman Returns over the original Superman soundtrack? To be honest I wasn't that much of a fan of John Williams score for that movie, he's a great composer and did the Superman theme extremely well, but as for the music within that movie, I just wasn't feeling it. John Ottman has a style that I actually like and since this soundtrack includes Superman theme song, this ultimately made my decision to buy it. I'm glad I did. John Ottman can't replace John Williams on the Superman theme, but this soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to. I recommend this to any Superman Returns fan.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is an awesome app I love too play it some may not like and that's there's option but I like this app very much so if u love fun games and unlocking new ones as you go this is the app for you
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was cool bend dghd dhrhe rush rygegvgeyv dudgeon dhvvd dh Dvd dudgeon dhbd dhdh dhdhvshhdv shes shah shah shabby
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a pretty cool app. I mean you have a ton of games you can unlock. I could stay on just this one app all day. It just needs a few tweeks like easier ways to unlock games or atleast easier ways to get coins but overall it's a great app and I definitely reccomend it especially if you get bored easily.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Good app to help plan a wordrobe for the week. Pretty accurate compared to other apps. Occasionally glitchy/finicky with errors but worth having. Graphics a plus. :)
B004G600A4|5.0|I really thought this was going to be a boring re-interpretation of a story we had heard so many times before....  SO wrong!  This was an amazing colorful and fun adventure that my child has enjoyed countless times, but I have looked forward to watching as well.....  I know this doesn't make sense... I hate cartoons...but this one is BEARABLE.  The story line maps with what we all know, but adds interesting twists and takes you where you never thought it would...  YEAH!
1451627289|3.0|I have two problems with this novel - A minor issue is that the characters are pretty much stereotypes, and therefore not very engaging, but a larger issue is that King falls back on the \\"Occam's Razor\\" argument to justify a PC perspective on the assassination. This is a pet peeve of mine. Occam's Razor doesn't apply to human motivation. People regularly hatch convoluted plans in order to promote an agenda. The evidence is in the complexity and stubborn anti-nature orientation of our society. Human behavior doesn't meld with or reflect activities in the natural world. A childlike, simple-minded, or psychologically unsophisticated person might not understand this, but Stephen King is none of these. He even creates a metaphor for this in his  repeated emphasis of the air and water pollution in the 50's and 60's. Then he fails to follow through with his almost-theme.  He could have extended this into human psychology, pointing out that it's not only the past that's \\"obdurate\\" - his vocabulary lesson for the populace. Will we now see the word used more often? - and that people stubbornly believe what is convenient and non-threatening to them. Instead, he rests his plot on the PC perspective on the events of 11/22/63, then rationalizes this in a half-apologetic, half-defensive Afterward.   Being a person who leaves the \\"Occam's Razor\\" argument where it belongs - in the self-regulating natural world - I wonder if King's novel would have been publishable if Jake Epping had followed the rabbit hole to Lyndon Johnson and associates. Perhaps not - especially going into an election year. But leaving aside \\"conspiracy theories\\" (that discredited and outlandish idea that human beings conspire to gain wealth and power,) a more generous explanation for King's literary sellout to the 5th grade version of U.S. history might simply be that a world in which people conspire to engage in coup d'etat would have required a much more complex plot, not to mention more character developmenton the part of his hero. It was undoubtedly easier to have Jake Epping remain safely asleep in the arms of the American propaganda cult.   All in all, this novel seemed to me like a tremendous waste of a great plot idea. However, there were some points where I laughed aloud, especially when King had the old guy make short work of the time-travel chestnut about the danger of killing your own grandfather, by saying, \\"Why the f____ would I want to do that?\\"   To be fair, King's job is to write stories, not confront issues that are preventing this country from facing nearly-insurmountable problems. I'll try not to hold it against him, though I am disappointed that, in the less overtly befouled air of the present day, one can't get a whiff of moral courage in a novel, let alone in real life.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My Daughter loved it from the first time to the 130th time she watched it!  This movie has a good story, lots of music and more.  It's sweet, it's fun and kids love it.  I have HAD to watch it (you know what I mean if you are a parent) a 100 times and I still don't mind...  Good job!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really fun, but some of the games are hard to control. other than that its a fun game. definitely worth it
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Such a fun movie!! I love it, my daughter loves it...!  You can't possibly be disappointed with this movie.  It's cute, it get's you moving and dancing with your kids, they start singing and dancing, you start laughing and it's all good!  Also has... has a fun set of extra stuff...  Could show it to my little one who is 2 without her getting scared= SuPER!  Bien Sur !  Super!
B003L77G6A|5.0|Fourth season is by far my favorite. If you never watched this show, and you love laughing at the sheer madness that is the funny world we all share. Than you have got to own the entire 1-2-3-4- 5 Seasons of this unique styled show. & if you enjoy extras, so far, 4 has a little something special at the end of every disk. But the 3rd disk holds the gag reel, and is soo much fun seeing the well acted cast F--up smile breaking Characters & laughing at the ubsurdity of perfection in our always perfect fall on your own face & laugh at thy self world. Cause we are the funny in this imperfect world...<br />Get it? Cause if not, then you are deluded, like Sheldon, & insane.<br />\\"My mother had me tested!\\"<br />Right, Bazinga Shelly.<br />The Characters, in case you are not familiar with them are all likable misfits, in their own low self, imagined ways, tho together the cast balances one another out, so perfectly, in an other wise proven, not too perfect world. They, & we all have to share. If we forget that fact, they remind us, in their desfunctunallity, and diversity to cope.<br /><br />In an other words perilous journeying, thru the gate ways of their humanity, & almost never pay for the consequences,at hand. Till human error arises, and proves genuine, humble inability, to see every flaw the gods laid out, in front of their perfectly planned out- well plans...<br /><br />Errhem! Brought down to an Earthen plane, no one can understand. But the modern four Stoodges of our time, and that adoring blonde across the hall, who can at times, out wit the guy's, and even the Mighty Sheldore, the most damaged, arrogant, & at times obnoxious, among them. Played by his ultra ego, Jim Parsons, who won two awards already, for his Anal retentive, germ phobic, phobic, stuborn man child, yet all amusingly, lovable, that is once in a great, epiphanous, & momentious of occasional, human connection, such as what is sarcasim??? Sometimes, even secretly, channeling Actor Brent Spiner's Data, & British actor, Chris Barry's infamous Red Dwarfer Admiral AJ. Rimmer, Smeg hed, Via Dr.X, as Sheldon S Cooper.<br />Johnny Galecki as Leonard Hoffstedder, Kunal Nayyar as Rajessh Koothipolli, & Simon Helberg Moist, as Howard Wolliwitz, and Theodore, as the beaver, with the extended ball. (I'm just testing you, that's from Season 2...) Honestly, I don't know how you can stand upright, without falling over...<br /><br />(Bazinga!)<br /><br />But to be Serious, for a milli sec, [whoah, too long Neo...] This show, is just, crazy enough, to last on it's own male merits but enter to the equation, of the formalacic Qauzzzars, of the 4 guy's + 3 equally funny, females, the secondary cast of Characters, who enter, & continue to leave, & enter thru the paradoxial shifts, or Seasonal change ups. Including guest cams, & the show never lets you down, with only breaking of the third walls- & back to Earth, you never feel quite the same again, from when you left it, not realizing you had.

B001HN690O|5.0|I love Jack Black as Po the Panda in this series.  The great part about Kung Fu Panda 2 is that it has a story of its own, you don't have to see the first movie to enjoy the second.  Some of the finer character details will be unknown (if you missed the first movie) but not missed and it does not detract from the movie.<br /><br />My 6 and 2 year old have not stopped watching this movie since it arrived for Christmas.  When it's time to pick a movie for our family movie night, this is always the first pick from the kids.<br /><br />I hope there are more Kung Fu Panda adventures to come!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game is hard in some areas, but ultimately it is a pretty fun and addictive game. by Mr.broski. beastly
B004EPYZXU|2.0|I originally saw this film displayed at the checkout counter at Rite Aid, so my expectation of the film was low. I bought it realizing that sometimes these unknown films are hidden treasures. Apollo 18 was not one of those films. The one thing I have to commend the filmmakers for was creating a realistic depiction of the 70's space program. The grainy simulated stock footage certainly gave the impression the footage was actually from the 70s. I should mention the production design and the simulated lunar surface have never been more realistically created as they are in this film. The filmmakers obviously studied meticulously the Apollo flights, which are now approaching forty years old.  Obviously, the filmmaker's eye for realism was done in order to make this a realistic horror film in the tradition of the Blair witch project, and several paranormal activity movies.  However, Apollo 18 falls short in the area of drama. There are only a few shocks in the film, while the rest of the story malingers on. Apparently, the astronauts along with a Soviet counterpart craft are sent to the moon to expose a contaminated life form. The astronaut's nemesis turns out to be spider-like creatures that hatch out of lunar rocks. To say this is ludicrous is an understatement. For the rest of the film basic science is thrown out the window and replaced with cheap thrills. The spider creatures themselves are generic looking CGI effects. The rest of the film resembles Alien, where the space spiders chase the hapless astronauts through the ship. None of the astronauts are allowed home.  How could the filmmakers in this day and age even contemplate any living organism on the moon? Maybe if the film was set on Mars it would at least be a bit more believable. This plot scenario would have worked better in the 50s, but today it is just silly. Then again there are those who still believe we did not land on the moon. Maybe this is the type of film they would enjoy.
B003K16P3M|5.0|All over the Seven Kingdoms, the Gracelings come into their Grace. A Grace can be anything from climbing trees to baking to swimming and more. Identified by their mismatched eyes, Gracelings are revered by Kings for their usefulness and rejected by the common people for their abnormalities. Graceling takes us into the world of Katsa, graced with killing. From a young age, Katsa was subjected to the cruel whims of her uncle King Randa. After accidentally killing her cousin for his groping hands, Katsa began training to become the King's enforcer.   Katsa, becoming tired of following unjust orders from her uncle, establishes the Council. The Council is an extensive network of people who use the information they gather to stop the power-hungry kings from abusing their people. The Council uses information to prevent villages from being massacred, people from being executed, and rescues those kidnapped by opposing kingdoms. The latter of these begins a series of events that will change Katsa forever.   After rescuing a Lienid prince from the dungeon of a neighboring kingdom and disabling all of the guards between the dungeon and her escape, Katsa encounters a mysterious Lienid. Instead of raising the alarm, he allows Katsa to flee, not before she knocked him out of course.   Upon returning to her uncle's kingdom, she discovers the stranger is already there. Not only is he a Lienid prince, but is searching for his grandfather, the very one she rescued.  Graceling was a book that my brother originally suggested to me, and I was going to eventually read it, but seeing reviews on it propelled me to pick it up. I was extremely engrossed by the concept of Gracelings and their different expressions, as well as how they can change over time. Katsa is a lovably guff heroine, who could probably kill with both arms tied behind her back and legs bound at the ankles, but struggles with her sense of self and her place in the world. As the book progresses, Katsa learns to stand up forherself and let down the walls around her heart that she so carefully constructed. Watching the relationship between Katsa and the other characters evolve from a simple acquaintance to true friendship is thrilling.   I would highly recommend this book to readers 14 and up as the author suggests. I found that being older while reading it allowed me to grasp the concepts better and more fully understand the struggles Katsa has as she discovers who she is and what she wants out of life. There is a bit of material that I wouldn't recommend for younger readers, but nothing too graphic, and the underlying tension would be difficult for young readers to pick up on.  Check out my profile and blog!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love playing this game, it provides hours of entertainment! Cute the Rope is totally worth the price, you should get it today!

B005FVFWOI|5.0|I just finished listening to the first CD of this set, which is the remastered version of the original.  It is amazing - so much clearer and punchier!  I believe this is how Tull intended Aqualung to sound in the first place.  Martin's guitar work sparkles throughout. Like a fine wine, this album has aged very well. The enhanced mix only makes it better. You will think they are playing a concert right in front of you. The 2nd CD is a bonus. Very well worth it, even if you already have an older copy. Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love these, some are actually quite challenging! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the controls are either sluggish or touchy on some of the games. but all in all, it kept me and my family amused!

THE SONG WRITING AND PRODUCTION ON THIS CD IS TOP NOTCH.<br />SCHENKER IS THE GREATEST GUITARIST OF ALL TIME TO ME AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST TWO CD'S THAT I WAS EXPOSED TO WHEN<br />I GOT INTO HIS PLAYING. HIS TONE WAS VERY INFLUENTIAL ON MY OWN GUITAR PLAYING AND HIS PHRASING IS ALWAYS EXPANDING.<br />HIS LATER VERSIONS OF MSG WERE EVER CHANGING, AND ANY MSG OR UFO CD IS WORTH THE PRICE.

0761158820|5.0|I started with this book and have now purchased many other papertoy books (and calendars) and this one is by far my favorite. Not only does it have one of the best categories, but they are precut! The cuts aren't always perfect, which is frustrating, but the time it save is so worth it.<br />The only complaint I have is the paper. I liked to used superglue as it held the best, but it bled through. I don't know if you could change the paper to not bleed and still have it perforated, and if not, I would prefer the perforations.<br />I make them at work when bored and people pick and choose to take their favorites home. So very fun.
B005JABSB6|5.0|These glasses are perfect for the Sharp Aquos 52in. 3D TV I bought.  They are comfortable to wear but somewhat geeky looking while wearing!  They charge quickly and maintain their charge.  My whole family enjoys 3D TV now and we adding to our video library more 3D movies.  Even the few channels of 3D TV I have that stream from DirectV are awesome.
0307949486|5.0|Although the beginning 100-200 pages of the book is a bit slow-going, I enjoyed the way that the author slowly built up the story and talked about various aspects of Swedish culture and society in order to give context to the events of the story rather than just skipping to the action. When the story really gets going, it becomes a book that's very hard to put down. Lisbeth Salander is a kick-ass yet mysterious character and the mystery of Harriet Vanger's disappearance is intriguing with many, in my opinion, unpredictable twists and turns.
0143036742|4.0|I have recommended this book to so many people. It is a great story of family life and it just made me laugh so many times!<br />The slavic-type background references, the cultural and language situations will just warm your heart!!

B000SZ22TE|5.0|I've been a Supergrass fan for years now and am so disappointed that they broke up. This album is fantastic - probably because it's a real album that you can listen to start to finish and every song is great. I personally love the different sound that they created on this album despite it being more 'melancholy' than their earlier stuff. It's the album of theirs that I turn to most frequently on my iPod...definitely recommend it!
0307959856|2.0|There was something about this book that was wasn't quite right.  It wasn't exactly a picture of manners and morals a la early 19th century.  It wasn't much of a mystery.  The characters were not interesting but too deep and shallow at the same time.  There was too much scene setting and character exposition without drawing you into that world at that time.    I had started to read the book hoping that Mr. Wickham was the body in question and that Lydia would have another chance. Not so.  It took too long for the plot to start and way too long to solve.    If you are a Jane Austen fan or a PD James fan you will be disappointed because the book caters to neither genre.  There was just something a little off about this effort.  There are better spin offs of the Austen characters and there are better mysteries.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This was one of my childhood favourites. And now, I watch it with my baby girl over and over again. One of the Disney's classics that will never dissapear.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was my first King book As horror is not my genre of choice, I didn't know what to expect, but I couldn't put this book down.The story does bog down a bit when Jake Epping is tailing Lee Harvey in Texas.This part of the book was a skim read,as Oswald seemed a flat character. I loved the premise and I loved reading about Jake's time in Jodie.It's poignant that a man out of time creates a past he longs to live in and knows he can not create. Overall,the book was fast paced and very engaging.

One of my favorite books good stories and great artwork.
159562015X|5.0|The Strengths Finder results are a tool that I will continue to use to drive conversations around who we are and how we can get more done.  I recommend this book and process to all people.  Three years back I was asked to take the Strengths Finder 2.0 test by my new boss.  A new team had formed and he used this in the past to learn his people and to get his people to know each other.    We found that the results to be surprisingly accurate.  The consensus gauged the personalized descriptions at 90-95% on target.    I continue to use my results.  One example is from a little over a year ago.  I moved to a new role in the organization to oversee a couple of teams of business analysts.  I used my Strengths Finder to help them learn how I think and what I value and how this reflected on the mission (reinvent the department).  I also challenged them to bring their strengths to the work so that our collective output was more broad and effective.    I give the lessons learn in Strengths Finder partial credit for accelerating the success of that assignment (cut the time required to complete by 50%).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like these games since they are quick but still give points once completed. Points do add up quickly to allow for more games to open.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I bought this because I got a Philips Docking system DC291/37 for iPod, iPhone and iPad (Aluminium)for Christmas.  On the box, it says that it will work with cases.  Well not the otter box!  And I called and they basically told me that it works with \\"thin\\" cases.  I said you mean \\"skins\\" and he kinda fumbled around and basically admitted yes.  False advertising in my mind.  Anyway their suggestion was that i buy a dock extender.  This is works and works well.  It does make it really tall and for something like this you may want to get a cable. I didn't want a cable on my dresser, which is why I got the alarm clock.  And taking off my otter box every night or permanently was not an option.  This extender working with this particular alarm clock works well because they have a little \\"brace\\" at the back of the port that holds up your phone and it is long enough with the dock extender to still do the job.  If I didn't have that little brace, I don't think I would be real comfortable using it.  But I can hold the extender and take the phone off.  I don't have to pull the phone with the extender still attached and then take off the extender.  Works very nice.

0470913029|5.0|This books simply makes sense and I am making this my diet plan. Not to lose weight but a diet that will allow me better health. We have not been around on this planet long enough to throw out our ancient ancestries food plan which made us what we are today. Think for just a minute. Our brain size grew over 100% in the last million years. Cultivated grains and dairy products are very recent compared to our primal beginnings. I am doing it with a sense of adventure, taking notes in a journal to log progress and will continue for 90 days. Boys and girls, I am a son of The Sixties, and grew up on home made bread so giving up grains is no easy matter. . .but it is much easier than I ever dreamed. Besides I want to be around as long as I can to watch my grand babies and children as well as be with my lovely lady.
B005LL4U54|5.0|Note: I have the score as mp3 files and for whatever reason, the official soundtrack is longer and some of the track names are different than what is listed here on Amazon. The official score has 31 tracks, whereas what is listed here as the score is 28 or 29 tracks, with some of the names being very different.<br /><br />The music for The Artist is simply spellbinding. Like the movie itself (which is a wonder to behold, as it is a loving homage to an era 'Gone With The Wind'), there are no words to describe how good the music is. The director and composer did a fantastic job. I highly recommend the score and the movie.<br /><br />EDIT: I have just heard the score, with the tracks as listed on Amazon and Wikipedia.<br /><br />The official score for The Artist is just as good as the soundtrack with additional bonus music. I highly recommend both soundtracks, of which the first one with the additional music is uploaded on YouTube. If you loved the movie, you'll love the music. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer for The Artist. A triumph in every way, cinematically and musically.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|What a great app this is! It has many different versions of the Bible including the King James and New King James (although the NIV is not available, which is why I gave four stars instead of five), dozens of different reading plans and devotionals, and it will even read the Bible to you with a charming British accent! Downloads are available for most versions so you can use your new app at your next Bible study!
1451627289|5.0|Made a new years resolution to read more books. This was my first of the 2011 year. I am not a big reader overall and was skeptical regarding its 800+ page size but this book was too awesome to put down. I was saddened that it was finished - I could have read 2000 pages. I would recommend this book to any one of my friends and to all you Amazon shoppers.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far the best Bible app I have come across.  It has definitely motivated me to read the Bible more. It is also very handy to have as it does practically everything you could possible want in a Bible app.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Back in August 2011, I spent an hour and a half playing this game on a tablet they had on display at Best Buy while Geek Squad was setting up my cousin's laptop. As soon as I saw that I could get it on my Kindle Fire, I knew I had to get this game. As an avid gamer, a game to have me saying &quot;I must have it&quot; is pretty rare. This game is a very fun puzzle game that you can easily get hours of entertainment from. I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good game that gets their gears turning.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|This was a gift I get to share! WOW....wonderful group, great songs.  Product arrived before due date. We are very pleased!

0061969656|5.0|Bernard Cornwell shows again that he is the master, once he gets back to his `formula'.  His previous book `The Fort' was a disappointment but Bernard shows that it was only an aberration and that he has not lost his touch.<br /><br />In the `Death of Kings', Lord Uhtred story continues - for those familiar with the Series (this is the sixth), the book will be very enjoyable.  However, for those who are looking at this series for the first time, I  would caution them from starting with this. The complex background in 900 AD England, the strange sounding names (both people and cities) takes some time to digest.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the game and it is free. Easy to understand and easy to play. Fills up time and I can pick up whenever.
B004UID2LC|5.0|works very well on my tablet. have no problem downloading videos or songs. would recommend it to anyone who likes youtube and wants to download music or videos.

B003L77G10|4.0|Don't let the name fool you. I was skeptical at first, but Julianne Margolies (spelling?) is fabulous. This show does a great job exploring some of the motivational factors that influence a decision to stay or terminate a marriage in the face of infidelity. It explores the family stress and impacts, especially since that \\"cheater\\" is a public figure. The martial and family story aside, it also offers a pretty compelling legal drama. I am a fan of Law and Order, and though this show lives more on the legal side than in the law enforcement the cases are compelling, draw from current events, and leave you sometimes questioning our legal system.
B003HE2B9Y|5.0|I love Rihanna's 2nd remix album Rated R Remixed. I love what Chew Fu remixed most of her songs from her 4th album Rated R. The remixes and the songs are very upbeat. Gotta love this remix album!!!
B0060ZJ78U|4.0|This is a fun movie that loosely depicts the exploits of the Oakland A's, a team that ate up the AL when they weren't supposed to make the playoffs.  The acting is sharp, the movie is fun, and the story is good.  As a movie itself, it is great.  I recommend this to anyone out there.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />I read the book before seeing the movie- after reading the book, the movie seems altogether a little brief, with many important details that are simply glossed over.  I am not a person who compares books vs. movies, but instead I am comparing the story of the book vs. the story of the movie.  For those who want a much more accurate account of the Oakland A's, read the book.  For those interested in a fun baseball movie, the movie should be sufficient.  For example, Jonah Hill's character in the movie isn't even a real person- he was a write-in character for the movie.  On the flip side, Paul DePodesta, a leading member of the A's front office in the time, is not portrayed in the film.  The film portrays Jonah Hill's character as introducing the team to the number crunching mentality that led to victory.  In reality, Billy Beane (portrayed by Brad Pitt) had been intrigued for awhile with sabermetrics for awhile and slowly built a front office that reflected his desire to implement this with the team.<br /><br />Once again, if you want an accurate portrayal of the story, read the book.  If you want a fun, slightly rewritten account of the story, watch this movie.  I enjoyed the movie for what it was, but it isn't accurate to what really happened.
B000L212HC|3.0|It seems like great directors and actors in between giant hits also have little artistic side projects which are like overlooked gems. LIke how Al Pacino and John Cazale also did Dog Day Afternoon in-between the Godfather movies, a quirky off-beat movie in between blockbusters.  Well, the Prestige is the Dog Day Afternoon of Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale. Lots of familiar Dark Knight faces return. Bale of course. Also Michael Hall. So it is a little weird seeing Bruce Wayne and Alfred stomping around Victorian England doing magic tricks.   That fades after a while, as you get drawn more into the story, but for the first half hour it really was jarring.   The director says that the movie is about movie magic, which is about taking obsessive account of the audience's perception and playing off of what they expect and what they might feel as they encounter a specific series of events. Yet, for such a movie, I found this movie a little less magical than other movies. Scene cuts during magic tricks were a little obvious, and I didn't really leave awed by any technical aspects that I witnessed, like I did in Dark Knight for instance.   There is a sci-fi turn towards the end which is entirely non-sensical, and David Bowie makes a surprise appearance, though you'll be surprised at who he plays. It's worth a view.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is wrought with tons of excitement, but deep sadness as well.  Suzanne Collins crafts an incredible work of art, not to say it is infallible, for there are a few semi-ridiculous \\"canned\\" moments.  However, I personally only experienced just a small hand-full of these 'moments,' and this did not really detract at all what I took from this literally heart-pounding experience.  I loved Katniss and Peeta, Collins described these characters with such zeal and made them extremely real and also highly likeable.  I won't go into excessive detail about what happens because obviously spoilers really damage the tremendous experience of a good book, but I will say that I definitely recommend this novel for anyone who relishes fantasy stories, but not outlandish fantasies, ones that have at least a small element of \\"truth\\" to them.  This is critical to how I became so drawn to the characters, their backgrounds, and the scenarios that they were thrown into.  It takes place in North America, basically after the U.S. must have plummeted and the new country of Panem has risen from the ashes.  What is both intriguing and terrifying about the tale is how something like this could nearly happen, maybe not to the same extent in the United States, but to some degree the Big Brother routine is all too well known by many Americans anyway.  Watch or read something on North Korea and the Peacemakers and Gamemakers in The Hunger Games have an eerily similar quality to them.  Anyway, back to the topic at hand, if you are wanting to explore an out of control government, combined with two seemingly unlike people who explore the possibility of love, with a reality TV-obsessed nation glued to the death of their own, then The Hunger Games is your unremitting treat.
B0043ZDU1E|4.0|This is not the usual Loreena McKinnitt album.  It is a collection of classic Celtic songs performed with McKinnitt's consistently high production values, musicianship, and talent.  It's like hearing Eric Clapton perform old blues numbers.  There really isn't much more to say.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a lot of fun. some games are harder than others but that keeps it from getting boring.

0439023513|1.0|Mockingjay was one of the worst books I've ever read; a complete and utter disappointment. It didn't take me long to read the first book and i found it quite enticing. I loved the plot, the characters, the whole idea! The second book didn't quite live up to my expectations, but i have to say, i enjoyed it. Mockingjay doesn't even compare. I do not mean this in a good way. I kept waiting for something to happen, something to thrill me or at least make me somewhat interested. I felt depressed the whole way through. Suzanne Collins made a mistake, a HUGE mistake in my opinion, no, several mistakes.   SPOILERS!-----------SPOILERS!---------SPOILERS!  KATNISS:  What happened?! What could have possibly happened to that brave, lovable protagonist? She's just a whiny do-nothing now. I can't believe it's the same character! Katniss, the Mockingjay, the sign of hope, what happened? She spent the entire book sedated in the hospital, hiding from her fears in a closet, or just feeling sorry for herself. I've been thinking, \\"Toughen up! I know your life is rough, but you can do better than that! What did you say about your mother? Oh yeah, i remember. You said for a while you hated her for not helping you after your father died. Isn't this exactly what you're doing except worse?\\" Gale and Peeta deserve better than Katniss. If she's gonna live her life feeling sorry for herself instead of moving on, forget her.  PEETA:  The soft, warm, affectionate character has turned into a raving lunatic. Do we ever find out if he gets completely cured, still feels urges to kill Katniss, or resorts to pain to pull himself into reality? Why aren't we told these things? Why has he been so suicidal? So he can help the mission? Oh please.  Gale:  Whatever happens to him? All Suzanne Collins says is he moves on with his life and gets a good job. Glad to hear that much, but what else? What is his job? Does he have a new girl? How could he have just abandoned Katniss without even speaking to her afterPrim died? He couldn't have just forgotten about her, not if they have been such close friends over the years. We have practically no information about how he turns out! He's like some minor character not worthy of an explanation. Really Suzanne Collins? Really?  PRIM:  Yes, war is horrible and takes even those we love dear, but what was Prim even doing in the front lines!? No matter her skills, they couldn't possibly leave a thirteen-year-old at such vulnerability! Prim was one of my favorite characters too, so how could Collins write her death the way she did? I didn't even know right away Prim died. I just knew Katniss was burning and getting some crazy hallucinations .  OTHER CHARACTERS:  What becomes of Haymitch? Or Annie at that matter? Annie was unstable to begin with, but with Finnick dead, how's she coping? I was just beginning to like Finnick when he dies and is just brushed off like another soldier. Katniss's mother, why doesn't she visit Katniss after Prim's death? Surely it must be really hard on her too. I nearly forgot to mention about Mags. Collins hinted in the second book Mags and Gale might like each other, so what happens? Is she alive and seeing Gale often?   I could write a better ending! Questions are left unanswered, characters are unlikable, the writing isn't even that great. It's a jumble and confusing. Readers should know what's going on without being told. They should be in on the action and have the details. Suzanne Collins spent way too much time explaining something that we already know (war is horrible) and not enough time on the answers. This book was flawed. By ruining this last book, the entire series was ruined. There's nothing worse than having an excellent plot and series destroyed by a bad ending. I read books to ENJOY! Not to feel sad and depressed! There's enough of that in life, we need more sunshine and hope; more reasons to love life and hope for the best. Nobody likes a depressing person, so why do writers often try to turn us into one? I may be insulting, but this book was an insult to me. I'm so glad i read the series after all the books came out instead of gaining time to build up my anticipation and expectations.
0812979656|5.0|I'm surprised that Roy has not produced another great work like this one. It is also hard to believe that this was her first book. It is so brilliantly written. The symbolism and imagery set her apart as one of the best current Indian writers. She has a real gift as a storyteller, and she offers much more than just a well told tale. She shows us the powerful cultural and economic forces that shape our world and our ideas.
B005ZCXFD2|1.0|But instead we had to watch in false hope that the thug-wannabe little bastards would all get killed eventually to no satisfaction. Seriously, I should've waited until Netflix had it for online viewing instead of paying for a rental.<br /><br />If you like the idea of the director making you despise the main characters and then force you to try to cheer for them in the end... either that or you believe pubescent teenagers acting out promoting thug-culture is the only way for them to be \\"cool\\" these days, then this movie's for you!
0142000655|5.0|This hard cover edition is an excellent collector's piece. Of all Steinbeck's works, this particular work s tands apart as one of his best, along with, of course, his masterwork, The Grapes of Wrath.  The conflict between the two brothers raises fundamental questions about sin and human nature, and the mother, about morality.  I could read this book over and over and every time marvel at the craftsmanship and genius that went into writing it.
B0041T7FS6|5.0|This is an amazing collection and I cannot wait for Volume 2!  The vaults tracks are the real story here, and they are all winners. Fonzi Thornton's \\"Change My Game\\" is a masterpiece of uplifting funk! I dare you to sit still while it is playing. It's mind-boggling that it was shelved, as it is an instant classic (to my ears.) Chic's \\"Just Call Me\\" is almost as intoxicating. And then there are three of the legendary unreleased Johnny Mathis tracks. \\"Something To Sing About\\" is my favorite, and I must say, having heard \\"I Love My Lady\\" online, I wish that one had been included as well.   Three much in-demand rare 12\\" mixes are here and they sound amazing: Carly Simons' \\"Why\\", Chic's \\"Soup For One\\", and the sublime \\"My Forbidden Lover\\" promo 12\\". Also of note is the previously unreleased Nile Rodger mix of \\"Dream Girl\\" by Teddy Pendergrass.  I also love the studio out-takes! Great fun to hear the guys jamming, talking smack, and having fun in the studio. I don't think they're wasted tracks as some other reviewers have felt. Their inclusion adds magic and just a touch of melancholy (thinking of the loss of Bernard Edwards) to the collection.  My only quibble would be that I would have liked more extensive liner notes, but it gives us enough information and I like reading Nile's thoughts on things. I think I'm going to buy his autobiography next, because he very intelligent with a great sense of humor, plus another thing I admire about him as a person in addition to an artist is his sense of history. Nile Rodgers always places the music in the social and cultural context in which it was created, and as an artist and a man of color, he has seen much. He was there to witness racial integration, the hippy revolution, women's lib, gay rights, and the Reagan '80s. His music is liberating, and people who say CHIC's lyrics aren't deep really aren't paying attention. \\"Good Times\\", \\"Le Freak\\", \\"Pretty Baby\\", \\"We Are Family\\", \\"I'm Coming Out\\", \\"My Forbidden Lover\\", \\"Have Fun (Again)\\", \\"High Society\\", \\"The Jam Was Moving\\". While the complexity and sheer GROOVE of the instrumentation may overshadow the deceptively simple lyrics, there is ALWAYS a great story there, one that is imbued with the verisimilitude of gender, race, and class struggles of post-modern American culture.

1250006341|5.0|If you are a fan of the \\"Downton Abbey\\" series, then this is a must read for you. Beautiful photography. Great stories about what it was like to live back in that era. Wonderful bits and pieces about the making of the program along with great quotes from the various cast members. Well worth the cost and your time. It will look good on your coffee table too. Cheers!
