B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was skeptical about this book as I have read several of the nde books and have also read the scientific, physical explanations for such experiences.  But, because of the circumstances here - neurologist experiencing this - thought I'd read it.<br /><br />While I am still not completely sure that his experiences weren't some type of physical reaction to external stimuli and loss of sense of place and memories, I found that his beautiful description of his &#34;travels&#34; somehow gave me a great feeling of peace.  It is a feeling that I was able to tap into (prior to reading the book) after having an extremely tragic loss and it returned while reading Alexander's description.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I had no idea that flowers and their names had such significance.  In addition to learning something, the book had a story that kept my interest the entire book.  It reads quickly, is not darkly deep and you will not have the usual understanding of flowers and their meanings when you finish.

B000SEIK2S|5.0|This book deserves an extra half star, at the least. The story is rare in that while following many traditional sci-fi traditions it also manages to be unique, and more importantly, not trite.

B00008S7KC|3.0|Watched this on the computer that's the reason for the low review, it won't work in my Samsung Blue Ray Player, other wise it's great. I don't know why it won't work in BlueRay player, it says it's zone 1 2 3 4 so it should work. If  you are a Floyd fan this is a must see, footage of them working the kinks out of the best album ever produced, Dark Side of The Moon. Awesome insight in to production.....

B0084AXZK0|5.0|I read this book years ago for a high school project and it is still such a great read.  I love this book and would read it a million times over.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|first book was okay. second book was hokey.  would not recommend to a mature reader.  teenagers would probably like it

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|The only reason  Igot this in 3D is that I got this at a good price on BF. The movie in itself is doesn't get any better by seeing it in 3D. Don't get me wrong, the 3D is a bonus feature, just didn't make me think that any of the scenes were more exciting by being in 3D.<br />I like the movie for the concept behind it and the fact that I like these types of Sci-Fi movies.
B00005ATZT|5.0|We love watching this movie at home. It never gets old and I can't wait to watch it over and over again.
B006JSXYPA|4.0|I already had the DVD version and wanted to see it in 3D. There are a few scenes where things pop out at you, but the overall depth of the video was less than what I was expecting. I'm still glad I purchased it in 3D and have watched it twice since owning it. I watched it on a LG Plasma with active 3D glasses.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|We love watching these movies at home. They never get old and we can't wait to watch it over and over again.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I first got this in the DVD format and it sat for over a week before my dad watched it. He came back with rave reviews on the movie so I figured that had to watch it. Between my girlfriend and I we've seen it at least 6 times and it's not just to see John Carter and Dejah Thoris ;-) They did some wonderful digital touchup on Lynn Collins in this movie...<br />The 3D version has great depth, IMO. This is definitely a movie worth re-watching, in either format.
B001HN694K|5.0|We love watching this movie at home. It never gets old and I can't wait to watch it over and over again.

B006LSZECO|4.0|It's not often that I can't predict an ending of a book. This was definitely a mystery, a book that kept me on my toes throughout the entire story. I couldn't put this one down. I found myself wanting, needing to find out what was going to happen next. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. I look forward to reading the rest of Gillian Flynn's novels.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|We love watching this movie at home. It never gets old and I can't wait to watch it over and over again.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Thank you Colleen Hoover for ANOTHER fantabulous book.  Absolutely loved it...I laughed and cried<br />Fell so completely in love with Holder..though not surprising you have given us fans ANOTHER male to fall in love with...how could you not<br />Wouldnt go to bed last night until i was finished reading..so 3 am i finally went to bed...so completely worth the late night!!<br />Was sad to see the book end...really would have loved to see Holder and Sky develop more in the aftermath.<br />Fabulous book, Definite recommend...
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I have read all five books.  I am very disappointed in the ending of this book.  You do not get to find out how it all ends.  Hopefully there's another book coming our soon.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|The seasons keep getting better. It's a good mix of drama and humor. The acting is superb and I care about the characters.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I always liked Katy Perry's music and now like it even more as well as appreciate Katy Perry as a person and not just some famous artist.  Great movie!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Very enjoyable because it is Harry Bosch at his annoyingly determined best.  And of course bucking the system all the way.  Go Harry Bosch, keep fighting for those who can no longer speak for themselves!  Hooray Mr. Connelly, keep them coming (and The Haller stories too!).
B005TBN3EU|2.0|This movie was just like watching more of the first one.  But they made it more unbelievable and ridiculous.  There were a few funny spots, but overall, I'd prefer watching the first one over and over again than seeing this movie.
B009NOVCTM|2.0|Just more of the same songs we've heard for 50 years. Do yourself a favor and get the two new songs and listen to your old Stones CD's and LP's to hear the other stuff.
B00932A2MC|3.0|It was entertaining enough.  I wouldn't pay money for it but if it were on cable TV I might watch it again if bored.
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|Reminds me of Red Letter Days. Just great straightforward guitar rock.<br />Fantastic. One of those cd's that every song is well thought out and a great listen.<br />Can't say that very often.
B007HJ84WS|3.0|I was disappointed in this movie, but, in reality I get disappointed in a lot of Greek Mythological movies.  Just stick to the mythology and stop with the gods are vulnerable stuff.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I am fascinated with near death experiences and found this book to be very interesting and believeable.  It got a bit slow towards the end though.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|I expected this to be the typical &#34;sequels get worse&#34; movie, but I like this one almost as much as the first.  Their was no perfection in it.  They screwed up and it was funny, in a serious setting.  I liked that.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|By now, if you have read book one and two you don't really need anyone to encourage you to read this book!  This evocative love story even applies to real life relationships - did I just say that!?
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|The movie itself I thought was very good.  It seemed like a good story, had a good mix of entertainment...action, comedy.  Was good.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Like I said in my review of book one.  You really must read all three books.  You will be delighted.
B006YXTRHY|1.0|While I didn't mind the first three, they had enough action to overcome the poor acting to make them mildly entertaining, and enough plot to make me want to know the final outcome, this particular movie was mind-numbingly dull.  Awful.  I imagine the finale has to have action, but judging on the trailers I've seen where all of a sudden &#34;Bella&#34; is a martial arts expert and is shown to be more powerful than age old vampires...uggggh...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Am I blushing?  I was when my daughter-in-law asked me what book I was currently reading!  I was embarrassed, but fessed up. The story takes and interesting turn when the young, damaged control freak, Christian Grey meets innocent Anastasia Steele.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under the age of 18, even if they were sexually active, just because it's a little kinky.....a lot kinky.  But I couldn't put it down.  If you read this book, you MUST read all three.  It is truly love story.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|I was very surprised at how good this movie was..it gets a bit brutal but that's ok by me..great acting and a great story line..
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars, because it had everything, romance, drama, action & fun! I couldn't put this book down, I literally stayed up until 3am! I love, love, love the character, Travis!!! I won't lie, there are times you go crazy because of all the turmoil but it's so worth it! The only thing negative I can say, is I wish it didn't have to end. This book does have sexual scenes but very mild. It's still so worth the read!!
B0096CDG0O|1.0|Didn't play well at all. We couldn't get the other one to play past the first turn and then all we got was they wanted us to buy something more to play. Deleted it.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Extremely unique... just my thing. I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it several years ago and though, since then, I've seen it several times, I enjoy seeing it again. It's just THAT unique. I am pleased to now own to movie and can watch it at my leisure.
B009J2VR3Y|3.0|didn't really like most of the music.  thought it was going to be like the tv performance.  title is I Will Always Love You
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  I never would have thought that I would like a movie like this, and thought Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, you've got to be kidding right!  But after seeing this action packed movie, I thought, Yeah, Abraham Lincoln, the Vampire Hunter!!  Really a different slant on History, but a very entertaining Movie!  My husband , too, didn't want to watch it, but we all were glad that we did.  So I purchased this movie for my son as a gift , he loves History and this is a really neat twist.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was definitely a page turner I was instantly  captivated by this beautiful love story...... and like Jordan was jealous myself..
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I love this album!  The mp3 download process was easy and fast!  Well worth the $6.00 I paid for it!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|The game is really fun and easy to play. First time players will see how much fun it will to learn to play chess.
B00002DE4L|5.0|Ordered this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter who 'lost' hers.  She's gonna be thrilled I found it!  As always, Amazon deliveres!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I loved this movie.  All the dreams within the dreams and how they set it up was so interesting.  It made you think.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Great collection for an outstanding price. I got this for a gift but I may end up ordering myself one after the holidays!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I'll keep it simple. Persona 4 is among my top 5 favorite RPG's of all time.<br />Not only did they manage to make it better by giving the graphics a nice, crisp, clean update,<br />but they also managed to breath new life into the game with the brand new content.<br />Some new scenes make me feel as if I'm playing a whole new Persona game.<br />I highly recommend Persona 4 Golden!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|i love the game but it has some problems. after you get up in higher levels it doesnt work right. you cant get stuff you need and it takes stuff away from you.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Kept me interested right to the end and am now looking forward to the third in the trilogy.<br />Passes the test of a truly good read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Oh how I loved this book.  I read all three, made me think in a whole new way. Love Christian Grey
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Easy to use. Picture quality could be better and you can only do videos in 720dpi, 1080 crashes the app and you have to reset it. But it works fine in 720 and it's not horrible quality, picks up sound well too. Overall I like it, for what it is.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I had just changed phones from my HTC Inspire to the Samsung Galaxy 3 and wanted to install Quick office, but found the free version was no longer available. Before going to the Quick Office Pro version, I wanted to see what free office apps were out there. Kingsoft Office is completely free and a full version. You can write, read, and edit docs! Very nicely laid out to find your docs and cloud ready!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Hilarious and witty. The epitimy of a Wes Anderson film. The best since The Life Aquatic. I will certainly watch again and again!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|EXCITING EPISODE.  CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT WHAT IS NEXT.  CALINDA ROCKS.  THIS GETTING TO BE BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.
B0095R64AO|3.0|It just seemed like it would never end but it was ok for just easy viewing.  I would recommend it.
B009HSPODE|5.0|A superb offering from Munro who is quite the best writer of short stories. I cherished every story and am so grateful to have had the privilege of reading Munro. Thank you.
B0060D123K|3.0|I purchased this to show at school but it would not play due play due to the district Internet filters.  I thought I could download it to my Mac but when I tried I got a message that it was not possible to download to macs.  I was disappointed because I never considered this would be an issue and had already purchased the movie at that point.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game is not an easy Mahjong game, but will definitely help pass the time if you are waiting or just sitting around.  The characters are complex so you have to play close attention when matching them up
B008Y7Y0AM|4.0|It took me a few listens to really appreaciate this album (even after being a MDB long time fan) but now I can say this is a MUST for any doom metallers out there. I hear a lot of classic Bride here but in a modern way to say it somehow. I hear more violin this time, i hope they continue to use it more in future releases. \\"Like a Perpetual Funeral\\" is definitely an outstanding track, slow, melancholic, dark... great \\"feedback\\" guitar sounds here.. \\"Hail Odysseus\\" is simply a masterpiece, what a track!<br />Definitely recommended album. Aaron's voice is incredible, he didn't abuse of the \\"lamented\\" type of voice he made on last record and sounds more natural, deep and dark as usual.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Fun game..great for parties.  We even bought the travel version, game for two that turned out to be much harder then expected!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Like that it is quick and easy to learn and appropriate for all age levels as it gets slowly more difficult.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Reviews a cold case whit h occurred during the riots in LA.  The story just doesn't move along as usual with too many heavy-handed subplots.  Bosch is still Bosch but not as engaging in this story line.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Average or better than relationships would have trouble finding this humorous, it is kind of silly.  Too bad, both actors are liked
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I guess the older Kindle Fire tablets are not compatible with this app.  That is the only thing I dont like about my Kindle Fire<br />t
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|One the best of the recent Clancy novels.  Jack Jr. is worthy successor to his father as a field agent.  The ending is mostly good, but does leave Jack's relationship life a bit hazy....enough for another yarn in the future.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Nice puzzle game. Easy game at first but gets more challenging as you go. I would recommend it if you like puzzle/maze games a good one to have especially at free.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Nolan, Nolan and Goyer prove they have obviously read plenty of classic Batman tales. One can identify elements of 'The Dark Knight Returns'; 'Knightfall' and 'No Man's Land' are fairly obvious. 'A Lonely Place of Dying' and 'Batman Beyond' can also be seen.<br /><br />Nolan has a degree in literature and it shows, the depth of each character is astounding.  The old faces of Alfred, Lucius, and Gordon are back and Nolan finds a role for each of them.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne is again explored alongside Batman. physically and psychologically 'The Dark Knight' and surrounding events have taken thier toll on the hero who bears scars that are obvious on the inside and out.<br /><br />The villains Bane and Catwoman (referred to only once as 'the cat') from the comics appear in this adaptation. Bane was a simpering idiot used as muscle in... Let's not bring up bad memories. Here Bane is closer to his comic interpretation where he is a cold, calculating genius whose strength is a tool to be used alongside any other and not a crutch. Fans may be wondering where Bane's famous Venom has gone, and about the changes to his costume. Needless to say everything has a reason afterall the joker didn't wear make up in the comics.<br /><br />Selina Kyle is so much closer to the comics than any other live action interpretation. Older fans are sure to look back on Pfeiffer with nostalgia, but that was Tim Burtons reimagining, though the closest villain to the comics, even his catwoman was off. Hathaway's costume reminds me of a Nolanized interpretation of the newmar costume. Her personality certainly fits the role.<br /><br />Finally there are a few characters, Miranda Tate who plays a character that can be recognized by long time fans. Daggett is in fact a creation of the animated series played a but differently and probably the flattest character. Last is John Blake whose name hides the fact that he is based on Tim Drake.<br /><br />The award winning cinematographer Wally Pfister returns to bring a beautifully shot film that deserves another Oscar, though I think the Director deserves one most.<br /><br />For those not into Cinematography, there is of course Hans Zimmer's score which feels like listening to the epic quality of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />I must say this film is so very close to perfection, though a few issues near the end that hold me back from saying it is perfect. I hold this maybe a fifth of a star less than The Dark Knight, and I implore you to watch this without too many expectations of the previous.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Love how cool this looks on my phone. Beautiful, lifelike, and serene. Doesn't drain my battery too badly either. Great app!
B0045TYDNC|5.0|These lens cap's fit properly. They have a nice snug fit which doesn't allow dirt and dust into your lenses. They also don't fall off. I bought this rear cap for the kit lens that came with my D5100. The kit lens only comes with a white cap that just pops on. Well guess what it pops off just as easy. Kinda dumb to put such a cheap cap in the kit. First I bought an aftermarket cap which twisted on but its fit was loose and sloppy. The LF-4 lens cap twists on and fits great. Just twist until its snug that's it. Never try to force a lens or body cap on. This rear cap also comes with all my other Nikon lenses to so its also a great replacement cap just in case I loose one.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|WOW ! LETS GET ALL THE PROTAGONISTS TOGETHER AND HAVE A PARTY.  THIS IS ONE OF DEMILLES BEST EFFORTS. IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO WAIT ON A WELL WRITTEN THRILLER.
B0009HAHD4|5.0|I recently bought this Eyecup for an old D70 body I bought used. It came with an older eyecup which was not flared like this one. It let in some light during shooting. I got annoying quick. I looked around and found out that the D70s came with the DK-20. I guess it was one of the hand full of small changes Nikon made from the D70 to the D70s. The DK-20 is a nice improvement over the original eyecup. Hardly any stray light gets in and its also allot more comfortable to use. This eyecup come standard on all the current entry level bodies including my D5100.
B000W93CHC|5.0|KEN FOLLETT'S GREAT FOLLOW UP TO PILLARS OF THE EARTH.  GREAT CHARACTERS, GREAT PERIOD OF HISTORY, GREAT STORY LINES. I LOVED IT.
0143122010|5.0|This is a monumental book. Like other Stevn Pinker books, it's eloquently, thoroughly and scholarly written, complete in everydetail, documented in the extreme, and unusually interesting. As usual, Dr. Pinker is brilliant. Since the subject is human violence, you can expect to read about some really horrendous and disgusting things our forebears have done. But that's necessary to recognize the point of the book: that humanity has, in its trial-and-error stumbling fashion, greatly curtailed a history of violence. Maybe this book can inspire us all to continue our recent history of peace-making.
B001RNO7C6|5.0|Obviously they are not able to walk on uncovered ice without slipping but the Vibram sole that they have does not get frozen and completely useless like my other shoes.  I love how comfortable right out of the box, like others I did not do any breaking in of my shoes.<br />I walk at work to relieve pain and stress and notice I can walk longer distances than without them as I have 3 sets of vertebrae with no discs and the shock absorption of the soles and the external shock pad is reduces stress on my back.<br /><br />I am a believer in Teva now.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|As a biologist, I've maintained for a long, long time that free will is not all it's cracked up to be.  Sam Harris presents the evidence that I needed to support my intuition on the subject.  And yet, he argues against blaming everything that happens on our having no free will at all.  There is an element of pre-destination that we need to examine and give it balance with &#34;free will.&#34;
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I really did not know what to expect when this movie was advertised.  I am familiar with many of these actors so I thought it might be good.  This movie is a wonderful meshing of young and old and how they can enrich each others' lives.  Love and caring, learning, growing, and entrepreneurship are not just for the young.  This movie shows that your life is a good as what you make it - at any age -  and not necessarily do you have to be in the surroundings you grew up in.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Fascinating read.  A challenging read.  Thinking about it long after I've finished reading it.  Interconnectedness of people from distant generations---important to experience and nurture.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is great story especially if you are also in your so-called Goldern years. Life continues joyfully as long as you are game to keep exploring options and new exoeriences.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michal Connelly is a masterful story teller. He keeps the reader engaged until the very end. I enjoyed this book.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I usually download Angry Birds games for my kids, but I'm hooked on this one. As an avid Star Wars fan (but not one who dresses up or goes to conventions), I thought this version of Angry Birds utilizes the characters from Star Wars to create some really fun scenarios and attack birds.
0375758992|2.0|Like my childhood wasn't weird enough, I have to read about another one? This was for my book club but I couldn't finish it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love this it is like real bingo with caller an back ground noise it it so much fun  love the different rooms to go to an you pick how many cards to play
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Although delicate this toy is so much fun!<br /><br />My husband and I had to open and play with it before gifting it to my nephew.  My husband and I found it challenging. We liked how it had practice courses and really thought of it really as a unique gift.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this for a child that doesn't know how to take care of their things. It cannot be thrown around and really needs a place to stay and be put back in that place after play.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|I love this movie. The story itself is fascinating, and the movie follows along with the book very well. This story just captivates me and I cannot get enough. It is a must see movie, especially for nature lovers.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Book moves like a freight train. Plot grabs you. ...but Jack please always wash new clothes before you wear them.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|This film should not be associated with the bourne films.  It seemed as if someone created a script that just had one thing after another happen and then they put bourne in the title..
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|Nice family movie for a 5 to 105 year old. This is a PG movie...great story line to get into the Christmas spirit.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This was a great read... I enjoyed it from start to finish... Like the other reviews say you really have to just read it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer was interesting but didn't excite me to the point of looking forward the finding time daily to read it.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|Plesantly surprise by both the quality of the acting, the exceptional screenwriting and cinematography, and most of all an unfettered fanaticism for Ms. Theron.
B006WZIETG|5.0|I've always thought Gremlins 2 was one of the rare sequels that was actually better than the original.  Part 2 just seems more in line with what 'gremlins' actually were, little monsters that caused chaos.  The second film is less mean-spirited than the original and pokes fun at some of the first film's flaws.  Know this though, the first film is a horror film, this film IS NOT.  If anything this film is basically a live action Looney Tunes film.  Terrific performances and a fun story make this a great film.<br /><br />As for the content of the blu-ray, be aware that there is nothing new added from the previously released special edition DVD.  What you do get is pretty terrific.  Deleted scenes, trailers, a vintage making of doc, a gag reel, and the alternate home video sequence are all included.  A full on new making of doc would have been nice, but alas this film was not the money printing machine that the first film was so we have to take what we can get.  The transfer is a bit soft and flat, but is still the best the film has ever looked.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />As a side note, there is a 3 movie blu-ray package available that includes both Gremlins 1 & 2 as well as The Goonies, so I'd hold off on purchasing this individual package and pick up the 3 pack.  I saw that package for cheap, but it's getting harder to find, so keep your eyes open.
B009AJDDQU|3.0|For what it's worth it completes the saga of Aliens by telling us where they came from in a manner of speaking. If you like the Alien saga, this may be just the movie for you.
B000NIVJGI|4.0|This is a pretty comprehensive repackage of a great movie.  The movie itself looks as good as it can, just don't expect anything reference quality.  The bonus material is pretty good, but a full scale &#34;making-of&#34; doc would have been nice.  This blu-ray is fairly cheap, so it's definitely worth the $10 I paid for it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|ANOTHER OUTSTANDING NOVEL OF HOW IT NEEDS TO BE DONE  WE NEED MORE MEN LIKE THIS AND GOD CAN SORT THE REST
B000X2H8G4|3.0|Bought this for hunting.  Works ok.  You get what you pay for.  Use the more expensive headphones with this. Nice and small for portability.
B009439HEY|5.0|This CD shows how lack Hackett made ​​to Genesis after 1978 ... It was the genial and acoustic side of the band. So far, the best work of 2012.
B0086213XW|3.0|not the kind of ending I thought it would be so was disappointed.<br />So I did not rate this movie very highly.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Exceeded my expectations, I love Nanna's voice.  I bought it for Little Talks but I was really pleased with the rest of the music.
B002Q9MZF6|4.0|to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations
B003V5CFV8|4.0|This is a great Movie, especially if you live in Mississippi!  Funny in many different ways, and the music is really enjoyable.
B0015AARJI|4.0|to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a wonderful piece of literature.  Your emotions run the gamut.... While it is geared towards the High School set... it's a great book to read along with your teen. Evokes a lot of good discussion.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|it would be great if it was a little longer for time because you can't do anything in 15 min.
098555780X|5.0|Will go a long way in helping me get going with paracord and all the projects that i have laying around
B009LREA1S|4.0|Good movie starts with a great story and great villian but plot becomes obvious at some point.<br />Really good action sequences.  But they stretch the story to make it a big movie.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Delightful story and great acting.  We watched the black and white version and the picture and dialog were very clear.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Love to play this with friends and family. Lots of fun and keep in touch with people. Easy t play!
B007N9FKCY|4.0|A fun and challenging game. It does seem very similar to another game, but it is FUN for all ages.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The usual trustworthy offering from Mr. Grisham. Imaginative but with the sense of the authentic craftily weaved throughout. Enjoyed it!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi is an excellent writer.  You never know where the story will take.  The only given is that it will take turns that keep you up all night in order to finish the book.
B0098VXE50|5.0|This is an interesting twist to a classic tale.  Kristen Stewart does a decent job in this movie (in my opinion.)
034580404X|2.0|HAD A ROUGH TIMER GETTING THROUGH IT.  iT NEVERV ENDS.  iT WAS VERY BORING TO ME.  I did nott care for it at all.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I mean it's just a calculator what else is it supposed to do I mean really a calculations a calculator
B00782O7NE|5.0|Has that old time feel to it.  The silent movie era. It's a bitter sweet story, and very compelling. You have to read the subtitles, but is worth it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Once again Clancy has written another enthralling book. It's a little scarey in that many times the plots in his books have basis in the real world past, present or near future. Plot lines aside it's nice to read a story that has very clear cut good and bad guys. Ya gotta love Jack Ryan. It's a shame he's only a fictional character, cause we sure could use a man like him now. I highly reccomend this book as I do all of Clancy's. He's an excellent story teller and writer. If you have not read any of his books, I suggest you start with Patriot Games and you'll be hooked.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Would you reas Winter of the World again? Why?<br /><br />Follett is best when he is writing a saga, like Pillars of Earth, etc. This certainly qualifies! Developing the story line across the key nationalities and socio-economic classes leading up to WW1 brings the history to a personal level.<br /><br />Any additional comments?<br /><br />I give this four stars, and not five, for one reason. All the liberal-minded characters are good. All the bad and evil characters are right-wing, money-grubbing conservatives. Surely in the thousand plus pages of this book, history would have found a few exceptions!!
B008HK3S4K|5.0|It is still in storage for Christmas, so I can only give a pre-rating for this product. I slipped my daughter's Kindle Fire HD in the case and it fit like a glove. I think that the Timbuk2 will keep her Kindle safe.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Patricia Cornwell continues to put out great reading.  It keeps your interest and makes for a quick read.  I think this is one of her better books.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|This movie is a true romance movie! My family loves it! Keira's acting ability is top-notched, and she pulls you into this movie..I am going to go and watch it again! This movie is definitely a keeper, and one to be watched continuously without boredom!
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|If your a fan of this movie, this edition is a must. The additional scenes will explain the story better and make it more enjoyable.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Got confused because split into 3. Would rather order 1 so I knew which order to read them in. Keep up the good writing John!
B00APUQT7I|4.0|The group gets split up after Scrat accidentally puts a crack in the ice and the continents split up to what they are today.  Of course, following the story line, they have to travel somewhere and face friends and enemies along the way.  Although it has some downfalls, its still a great comedy for all ages.  I would definitely recommend this movie.
B005USZML4|4.0|Got confused because split into 3. Would rather order 1 so I knew which order to read them in. Always enjoy a John Grisham book.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|I love this movie, couldn't believe it was John Travolta the whole time until I opened my eyes!  love the story line, love the cast, love the songs, love to dance to this feel good movie for the whole family!  set in the 50's where blacks and whites couldn't and wouldn't get along - this is the perfect coming of age movie for any young girl!
B003B02OOG|4.0|I like the being able to read a group of short stories, all keeping my interest. Always enjoy a John Grisham book.
B000VZGK3K|5.0|I choose ratings that are high because I don't trust lower ratings.  You have to watch the internet closely for dishonest business practices.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Got confused because split into 3. Would rather order 1 so I knew which order to read them in. Always enjoy a John Grisham book.
B007V4LKRU|1.0|This is not Rush as I've expected. Very frustrating at the end where they seem to add anything to fulfill the album.
B005LAJ212|5.0|What a terrific series- hope it continues for several more seasons.  How can one get involved in so many situations
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I recommend this movie for all who Don't Believe in Santa - the story is just terrific and the characters are great -- Cudos to the makers of this movie
B0053O89KG|5.0|We have loved watching all of the Castle seasons and like this one too. Sorry I am out of words.
0395389496|5.0|I bought this book for my grandson - we watch the dvd and then I read him the book - I am also building him a 8x8 Polar Express Lionel train layout which will fold up against a wall
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|A little preachy and not much batman, but a decent plot and the ending would surprise those not familiar with the comics.
B0015DWLD0|5.0|The life of a poor Indian young man who thinks that &#34;making it&#34; would be wearing the tan uniform of a petty bureaucrat. He details his days and nights as the driver for a wealthy and corrupt businessman.  By necessity he must make himself invisible as he waits and watches his employer's activities.  The pages of this book flew by on my Kindle.
0385535147|4.0|I refer to those books that entertain without engaging as Popcorn- fast read-no calories-no lasting effects.<br />Other people call them Beach Books, etc.<br />This author is a pro at such fiction lite and I throughly enjoyed this new volume, which I bought for a road trip.<br />I would say it elaborates on the most exciting portion of The Firm, while cutting out the extra verbiage, a page turner that can be forgotten in 15 minutes, perfect for a plane trip too.<br />There is always a place for this type of fiction.<br />For more edge see Thomas Perry, another favorite \\"Popcorn\\" author of mine.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This is a fun little app in which one can make any different number of exotic rhythms, just turn off the floating node part. The node system of making music is entirely new experience for me and I enjoyed it thoroughly. For the price it is quite incredible.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Way too many pauses in the buffering of the down loading. Red box would be cheaper and more more enjoyable.
B004V5QWU2|1.0|It has allot of different ambiance style sound bites, but none of  them are very good and each sound has to be individually downloaded from the internet, so it takes allot of time to figure out it isn’t that good.
B000641D2Y|3.0|As a single man in New York with no one to spend the Holidays with, I try to calm down over the fact that I am all alone by watching Christmas films and drinking copious amounts of Italian table wine. I have watched many Christmas films this month. I found Elf to be a story that parallels to my own life (never really knowing my parents and being much taller than the people from my village). Die Hard made me reflect on trans-national terrorism and consider the fundamental undertones of capitalism around the Holidays. Having spent years wondering what the world would be like if I was never born, It's A Wonderful Life speaks to my soul. Richie Rich's Christmas Wish is also a fine film that reminds New York bankers like myself that you can have all the money in the world, perfect hair, great teeth and a love for neck scarfs, but you can't save Christmas without friendship...<br /><br />Recently, I stumbled upon the film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. Feeling lost myself in a city of eight million people, I picked it up. Figuring from the box that the main character had been alone at home once before in his life, I figured that the sequel was going to be about his ability to overcome his loneliness in a town full of strangers.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />This movie is a glaring expose about the dangers of American society in the late 20th century, the shocking rise of identity theft, the lack of protocols on flights across the U.S. airspace, the ease of criminals breaking out of Illinois jails, and the proliferation of Pigeon women living in the roofs of choir halls.<br /><br />First off, the title is an absolute lie. He's not even home. He's from Chicago, and this is a movie about New York. How can  you be \\"home\\" when you're 790 miles away and you FLEW THERE only because the pre-9/11 protocols were so inept. I mean seriously, you didn't even need to have a ticket to get on the correct plane back then. He just crashes into a stewardess and says \\"My family'son that flight... let me on.\\" Sure... We don't need your name... jump aboard. Maybe the only thing I'm thankful for this Christmas is the TSA and their ability to keep rogue passengers off planes. And did I mention he's leaving his home, not going home to be alone there by himself.<br /><br />Second, the box is VERY MISLEADING. Look at the box, and don't make the same mistake that I did. The villains in this film are actually human size... not the size of the Empire State Building... This sort of false advertising is destroying our culture from within.<br /><br />So here's the gist. He goes to New York, and he just happens to check into a hotel, which is not really alone either. Just knock on anyone's door and poof, you're together with someone. Rob Schneider wanted to hang out with you... Then you wouldn't be Alone. That's what this movie should have been called... \\"New York Together... Too\\" Even Tim Curry was there, and he doesn't say a word when a kid checks into the most expensive hotel in the world after playing a tape for the hotel booking agent to make a reservation with the voice of a mongoloid. Did anyone think that a 9-year old could really be a criminal mastermind and steal credit cards? What the hell kind of society were we living in? Tim Curry didn't even ask for ID (And don't get me started on the scene where Curry sneaks into the bathroom to sneak a peak at the non-existent father in the shower). Let this be a lesson to owners of Diner's Club cards. Write \\"Check ID\\" on the back, and they'll return your thieving children to you.<br /><br />Then, two bad guys, who I guess were in the previous film, busted out of jail, and found themselves in New York. Did anyone work in that jail or did Illinois have cutbacks and only have one guard working that day... And again, they too were not \\"home,\\" nor were they \\"alone,\\" because they are sort of a bizarre slapstick couple that refers to themselves as the Sticky Bandits -- even though the box has them listed as \\"Wet Bandits.\\" This is a Christmas movie, I swear.<br /><br />The film climaxes in a very stunning series of events where the two men attempt to capture the little kid. Again, I didn't see the first movie, but I assume that the young kid owes them money. They proceed to chase him through an abandoned house right in the middle of Manhattan. Naturally, this movie is nonsensical because there's no possible way that the New York building code would have allowed a house with that sort of property value to decay into a pit of despair.<br /><br />The only person to touch a woman was the nine-year-old when he gooses a woman on the street, thereby again showing the serious problems with public groppings in our society back then. If anything, this movie was likely a training vehicle and justification for the expanding police state.<br /><br />The primary highlight was the arc and story of Dunkin's Toy Chest, where the boy ends up stopping a botched robbery to steal thousands of dollars from sick children. But this again is just a sign of the moral and societal decay that infested New York in the late 1990s.<br /><br />But the toy shop itself was really sweet. It reminded me of when I used to stick my head into dollhouses so that I could feel like a giant. I miss those days, and must say that Hollywood has a lot of work to do. In conclusion, New York City is a land of contrast... thank you.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Controlling your craft is very hard at first, but it is by far one of the best racing games for a phone.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I couldn't put this down. I even looked in my own city for a poetry slam... Good story, great characters. And I bought the 2nd book RIGHT after I put this one down.
B00005O438|5.0|I saw this movie many years ago.  My son asked me if I had this movie and I did not. I checked out Amazon and found it for a very reasonable price so I purchased it.  It was exactly as described and shipped fast.
B001EHDQFO|4.0|Good concepts to follow. I've already begun to use some of these ways to move forward with tasks i've been putting off. Many of these I've experienced in the past, but it's been a good refresher. Want my adult children to read this and hopefully pick up some very worthwhile ways to conduct themselves in life. I recommend this book. Very easy to read.
B005KXT58U|5.0|Just downloaded this album and have already listened to it 3 times. This album is incredible. I abslutely LOVE Amy Lee and Evanescence.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Not as good as his other novels. Seems formulaic at times and too predoctable. A bit disappointing from someone that I consider to be the best modern wruter.
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|Very contrived.  Poor plot.  Not as fun as the first.  Lots of action but it never really made any sense.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is a great book, love Clancy's continuance to keep his reader and fan waiting for the next chapter of this Saga.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This will be a very short review because I can't get specifics without spoilers. If you have read the first two you will read the last no matter what. This one was all around the weakest of the trilogy with so many things that happened that truly had no point to the outcome but to be there just to break the spirit of Katniss. ***Minor spoiler, it will at the end give Katniss a peaceful life, but there was no point to her greatest sorrow. All I will say if you can read a library copy. Fortunately, if you do buy it will not be at the hard covered prices.
B0072OFM28|4.0|The 2nd season was a mite too predictable, but the eye candy was there......Gotta love Lucy Lawless. Blood guts and tits what a combo.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|My son and I love American Horror Story. We especially loved season 1. Season 2 a little less although the story line is gripping and the acting is insane (no pun intended). I would watch the show just to see Jessica Lange alone - her acting seems effortless. She is priceless.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is captivating and addictive! The dark story line keeps you shocked and surprised and unnerved. I love the way they have recreated actors into new characters. Very clever!
B0077EBWVI|1.0|Well sometimes 20 words is too much for these reviews.  I can't stand remakes as a general rule, but some are okay. THIS is not one of those.  It is horrible the way they changed the story.  It completely lacks the magic of the original, so do yourself a huge favor and watch that one instead.  I cringe that this terrible movie is even billed as the same as the first one.
B00A6I87UQ|1.0|the digital version completely useless due to app not able to be used on iPad<br />No usable iPad app reader available on scouring web
B0086213XW|1.0|This film lost me in the first 5 minutes, but I gave it a chance because I loved Michelle Williams in Dawson's Creek. This movie does nothing to showcase her amazing talent.  And her chemistry with Seth Rogen was non-existent.  Totally insipid movie.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is a lot of fun! It is as if I am actually in a casino winning money! I would recommend this game to my friends.

1401322786|5.0|I loved everything about this book. Very well written!! I gave me a whole new perspective on life and how important time is!! It made me cry several times, but I have read it several times since! I've also had my mom read it and she loved it.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I didn't want this book to end. I felt like I really knew each character & would love to visit them sometime.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|If you like to see an issue from both sides, Jodi Picoult is the novelist for you. In this book, the issue is assisted suicide and it is up to the reader to decide whether or not it is murder. She delves into grey areas and really allows the reader to question their own beliefs. Jodi creates wonderful character studies and you grow to like them, flaws and all.
B000VI70X6|5.0|Bought this for present for a friend. It is such a great upbeat DVD and really gets the party going.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love this show my favorite.  Love all the actors and the writers must be great.<br />  I hope this show lasts for many more seasons.
B00A5IXYR8|5.0|The use of contrast in this film is exceptional. Black and white film may make that easier, yes. David Lynch pulls it off in a way that tells a story. It seems as though it creates some psychoactive stimulations in your brain when blended cohesively with very imaginative framing angles and the craziest plot I've ever witnessed.

B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Thsi movie made me laugh a few times. Not worth renting or buying. Wish I could reverse this sale. Not as funny as I thought it would be.
0811847365|4.0|My grandson was so excited about this book. It was just what he wanted.<br />The book arrived quickly and was in like new condition.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|It was OK. It's just like Clint without a gun. The best way for me to rate movies is, if I feel riped of for spending $4.99 for the movie and wished I waited til it came out on a premium channel than the movie is not that great. This was worth the price.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|What is it that is appealing about Dexter?  Is it the likable murderer? His foul-mouthed sister?  Romantic or funny or weird subplots?  I have no clue.  I just keep watching it; sometimes into the wee hours of  night (which I often regret) and yet do it again...
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I was very disapointed with this movie. I was expecting much better. This is one I would wait for it to come out on a premimum channel. Wasn't worth the rental and ceryainly wouldn't buy!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I'll preface by saying that it's easy to dismiss fanboys reviews as having a \\"Halo Effect\\" (pun intended) before they even start.  Rest assured that this is not the case.  I have enjoyed Rush songs over the years (heck, I even learned \\"Bastille Day\\" in my fledgling days of trying to forge my own high school garage band) but was taken by surprise to find the threesome was still even in existence when I heard \\"The Wreckers\\" on Internet radio recently.  What happened next has been nothing short of extraordinary.<br /><br />Since I subscribe to an online source that provides unlimited access to music, I decided to taste the Clockwork Angels lineup.  I have to be honest that my first time through probably looked like the Reverend Jim sampling his first \\"funny\\" brownies in Taxi (really showing my age here): I sampled, rolled my eyes, and uttered a less than impressed, \\"Meh\\".  I said, \\"Fine, I did it, now let's move on.\\"  But I picked up the remnants and couldn't let go.  Like Reverend Jim, it didn't take long until I was addicted.<br /><br />After a few times through and finding I couldn't stop liking it, I read the reviews here.  Both good AND bad.  I saw where the slams about the \\"muddy\\" sound came from, although in my digital version it probably came across a little cleaner than the CD.  So I started going back through the anthology and sampled the comparative products in Vapor Trails, Test For Echo, and Snakes And Arrows.  It was a great re-discovery of Rush over the years but the more I listened the more I realized that Clockwork Angels was something special.<br /><br />Every piece of art affects a person in a different way, and so it is with music.  I will say this, however: Many times I have heard people refer in their past how an album \\"changed their lives\\".  I scoffed in the past, secretly thinking, \\"C'mon, dude.  It's just an album.\\"  That was before Clockwork Angels.  This for me, has become my \\"Sergeant Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\".  To think that these guys made this after nearly 40 years together, at nearly the age of 60, is nothing short of unfathomable.<br /><br />So to make this a review, let's hit the high points and try to avoid the redundant:<br /><br />1) Yes, it's a concept album, tying together a story.  When you know the story it's even better, but I love the suggestion that you listen several times to get the feel of the music before you learn about the story.  I never had heard the term \\"steampunk\\" before this album but it has suddenly awakened an itch in the genre I never knew I had;<br />2) The writing of Neil Peart is absolutely brilliant, as always.  The fact that the man can create this yarn out of nothing and have his two bandmates weave a musical sound to match the words is beyond words;<br />3) Lee and Lifeson have never been more vibrant at their craft than they are now.  I could do as many before me have done and recount each song ad nauseum as to their brilliance, but suffice it to say each song sounds so much better every time through;<br />4) The musicianship of the threesome is nothing short of brilliant.  Perhaps it's having first heard the song \\"The Wreckers\\" immediately after listening to Green Day attempt to replace musicianship with shock in their lame \\"Kill the DJ\\" that I grew an instant appreciation for what \\"Clockwork Angels\\" represents.<br /><br />Most important, the album sends the listener through an amazing roller-coaster of sounds.  The hard charging Caravan/Bu2B combo lead into the orchestral title song, followed by a pair of well-crafted songs.  The monster ballad \\"Halo Effect\\" is as haunting as it is beautiful, and every man who has fallen for the wrong woman will identify with the words, sentiment and feel of the song.  From there the boys alternate between heavy duty rock/blues and a softer side until the truly novel \\"Wish Them Well\\", which occupies a spot on its own.  This spicy little number offers a little 70s throwback with some contemporary twists.  At no point on the album does the group sound more three-man: In the offing, never have they sounded better.<br /><br />The finale \\"The Garden\\" deserves a category unto itself.  It is peaceful, it is beautiful, it is brilliant, and it is the seminal piece of song-writing from an amazing career from the three.  Every time I listen to it a different, powerful image is evoked.  It would be easy to identify this as the band's equivalent to Led Zeppelin's \\"Rain Song\\" but this surpasses even that masterpiece.  Peart clearly hammered away at the concept of time and the impact of life and Lee and Lifeson boiled this into a masterful sound worthy of the sense of reflection that Peart intended.  I defy any listener to pay careful attention to every aspect of this song and, reflecting on the numerous number young lives lost recently in Connecticut, not be moved to tears at how they lost \\"the fullness of time, the only return that [they should] expect\\".  Yes, time is indeed STILL the infinite jest.<br /><br />Okay, this is long.  I've never written a review before, but nothing has moved me this much before.  This is an album, something of an anomaly in the 10's.  All of the songs together weave a beautiful tale, and it amazes me that a trio of guys of Canada (two of whom came together as buddies in school) could create something this majestic this much later.  John Lennon once said, \\"It's not so amazing that the Beatles broke up after 10 years but the Stones lasted.\\"  What would he think to hear a group who had been together nearly four times that long putting out something this meaningful?
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|If you grew up back in the days of this music, than it's a great flashback, other wise it's just another movie.
B0064BCNA4|2.0|I got the app thinking it would be good to pass the time, hammering out simple melodies. on t he  Amazon kindle 8.9 the touch of the keys is so delayed that it is distracting. I removed it after one day.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I do not want to give much away, but this is an amazing and powerful story.  I have read about 100 books this year and this is in my top 5.  You will not be sorry.  Colleen did an amazing job with this love story!!!
0714834491|5.0|This was a gift for my son, the graphic designer.  He loved it.  He found it informative and fun to read.  He highly recommends it.  There are tidbits of info for anyone in the advertising/graphic design field to enjoy.
B005K17RU0|4.0|the only thing I don't like is radar map in motion doesn't work great.Every thing else is super. The free one is good by me.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoyed the story line.  As always M Connelly makes it difficult to put the book down.  I recommend this to any reader that likes<br />mystery stories.  This would make a good movie.
B005LAJ212|4.0|If you're into cheesy shows where rich people do rich things and the plots get more and more absurd, then this will definitely do the trick. I gave this show four stars instead of five because a couple of the episodes were clearly mailed in by the writing staff (not that they're putting out Emmy-worthy stuff in the &#34;good&#34; episodes). Great price compared to retail. I recommend.
B008IGP8QE|4.0|Packaged like new and very cheap! And not to mention I didn't have to fight the crazy christmas crowd!! :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very interesting.  This book held my attention throughout. A lot of medical terms, raw emotions and totally believable-sometimes envious for  his experiences.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Very fun to play. An easy casual experience. Voicework and music are well done. Easy enough to do things without spending money.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|I had the DVD version, but the Bluray version is even better.  The image quality and depth of color is stunning.<br /><br />The frame from a theatrical print is pretty cool.<br /><br />One of my all-time favorite films.
B00122OCJ0|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of Enya's. Her voice and the music are fantastic. I listen to the album frequently, and now I can take it with me more easily.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Love this show. The on demand streaming service worked great. No lag time, buffering, and loading time was very short. Great price to pay to catch up on the season!
B004FP1WX0|4.0|This is definitely an original. I have not seen a movie like it. I think Nev's willingness to let the public into his own experience, is only a glimpse of what makes this documentary good. Even knowing he was betrayed, Nev sought the truth while exhibiting understanding and kindness. As uncomfortable as this situation was, I thought it was fairly well done.
0470901071|5.0|This is a great aid and comes with a dvd too. It is a great buy at this price. Just started using it and simply love it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read every book this author has written. Love every one of the. I do love my mysteries and Connelly and Sanford are my favorites
B004EKCNMA|5.0|I really enjoyed this version of A Christmas Carol. This has long been one of my favorite Christmas stories and they managed to make it funny, scary, endearing and all around enjoyable.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This movie was ordered for my niece and nephew to have in their collection of fave Christmas movies. Good condition!
B00846REIS|4.0|Good read. If you liked 50 shades, you will like this. A romance for every one. The characters just comes alive.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I cant review this book totally yet  because I haven't finished it yet. What I have read is very interesting  and it keeps with the spirit of the 1st book.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|The earlier reviewer's knock on Disc 2 of this release actually has some silver linings.  He has a point when he complains that (1) the concert is sorely abridged; (2) it's drawn from a tour of Clapton's previous record release, not the tour for \\"Slowhand\\"; and (3) several of these live songs have appeared on previous compilations.  Now here's the upside to each of these points: (1) the whole concert is available as an MP3 download from Amazon, at a reasonable price of $14; (2) fans have clamored for music from Clapton's Spring '77 shows for years (evidenced in the abundance of available bootlegs), as it was the second leg of the tour and the band was sharp as a tack; and (3) the Hammersmith Odeon show is one of Clapton's historic triumphs, a sterling performance from top to bottom, which is why it was siphoned for both of the \\"Crossroads\\" box sets -- and, indeed, the full set presented here is a remarkable listening experience.  Yes, we've all paid for much of this music before, and yes, it's a shame we aren't able to enjoy a show from the \\"Slowhand\\" tour (we'll have to settle for the brief set that appears on \\"Crossroads 2\\").  But to finally have the full Hammersmith show from April '77 is worth the wait and the price.  We're reminded of how Clapton at his best could bring great musical muscle to songs from even a ramshackle collection like the \\"No Reason to Show\\" album.  This is the goods.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is awesome, they even showed it on Ellen!!!<br />Only problem is the adds ...there everywhere but it rocks
B009JBWOU0|5.0|for 17.95 this was to good to pass up i had the original but loaned out 2 so for around 3 bucks more it was perfect and is collectibal and also has a behind the scenes picture book inside its cool worth it all the way
B004SBULWE|1.0|This was a good task killer and saved battery.  Now it kills nothing and the battery is dead in a hour.  I've deleted it and replaced with a completely different one.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I enjoyed this book, it was a follow up to the previous series with these characters. Sorry to see some of them leave or get killed off.<br />Mike
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I was invested in this book, i really wanted to know what happen to the characters. Good interesting writing, that didn't waste my time talking about scenery.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|I called Cisco/Linksys tech support. Someone told me I had called the wrong number. I called the new number and got someone who said none of the right tech support people had been available, so I had been routed to the wrong place but some of the right ones were now available so I should call back. I did call back and got someone who said I was still at the wrong place but she would put me through to the right place. I waited on line for 8 minutes, being assured that an engineer would be with me. But then the line went dead. I called back again, waited 8 minutes, the line went dead. I called back again and asked for a supervisor, but after being on hold for 10 minutes, I hung up. Then I bought Netgear equipment, called tech support, was put through right away to a very helpful person.
B0076DELIG|2.0|I found it pretty slow and predictable.  Not up to Connelly's usual quality.  Could be that it's time for Harry to retire...
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This was such a disappointment from Ridley Scott.  Characters and script were weakly developed, the narrative twists seemed either completely predictable or utterly opaque.  You know you are in trouble when your most (indeed, the only) interesting and nuanced character isn't even human.  Not a memorable line in the film.  Expected so much more.
B008B68IEA|4.0|Everything is adorable. The only thing I wish is that the inside of Shiver's bed was plush or they gave him a matching blanket!
030758836X|2.0|Characters are all overblown as either crazy dangerous or dumb dangerous. When I came to the end of this book all I thought was, &#34;What a waste of time&#34;.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|It came fast, all the discs worked, and it is a fun series.  There is a lot more to Eccleston's Doctor than appears at first.  It is well worth watching a couple of times.
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|The music flows and illustrates a wide range of emotion. Despite its obvious similarity to the Lord of the Rings soundtrack, it is unique in its own way.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|If you are a fan of the Doctor, you will really love some moments.  I agree with other reviewers that (spoiler alert) the handling of the Doctor's &#34;death&#34; didn't follow the long-established rules.  But, the alternative would have been unbearable.
B009MB682W|5.0|Nice collection of the original title songs that appear to be in the order of film releases (but I didn't verify it).  I recommend this to fellow Bond music fans.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This has got to be my favorite author!  Like his previous books, this is a riveting tale of a future that is all too possible:  a clash with China over the South China Sea.  It starts out slow:  I had a little difficulty getting started, having just finished another thriller.  But getting through the background is so worth it!  The story build and builds!  You can't put it down!  It keeps building all the way to the last few cleanup pages!  Magnificent!  How does he do it?  What a gift!<br /><br />I love the depth of the characters:  not too much detail that you get bogged down as with some authors.  A perfect mix of action, suspense, characters, and threat that is Clancy's hallmark.  A Must Read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn has written a real gem here. It starts off heading down a path that we've seen way too much of lately in the news (Scott Peterson, Drew Peterson etc.) and then veers sharply in a different direction...and when that happened midway through the book, I burst out laughing - very clever...
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Great Christmas movie. My boys wanted to keep watching it over and over.Will probably be one we watch every Christmas.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another very solid Bosch book from Connelly. Unlike other mystery writers who started out well but have since jumped the shark (i.e. Patricia Cornwell), Connelly continues to produce great material. The only slight issue I might have is with the daughter...that side story is a bore but hey, maybe it's just real life...
B009CPIR9K|4.0|naive teacher (Julia Dietze) thinks Charlie Chaplin was boosting Hitler's image in a short called &#34;the great dictator&#34; she shows to her class. She gets an education of her own when she seeing the uncut film and also when she runs into Aryan skinheads who she thinks are like minded nazis.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Having watched the first two seasons of the HBO series &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;, I hoped to continue the story line with Storm of Swords. The book closely follows the the plot portrayed in the television series so I recommend it for anyone whos interest was initially captured by the HBO production.<br /><br />Prospective buyers should realize that the character and plot depth requires thorough and somewhat lengthy description.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|No instructions.  Not enough time to learn how to play.  Ads pop up all the time. FRUSTRATING!!!  I do not recommend unless you only want about 10 seconds to play then you have a 30 second ad to watch.  Not even enough time to figure out how to play.  Not fun at all.  But then again how would I know? - They don't make it easy to learn or even give you time to know if it will be a game you would love before ads begin.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|The year 1947 produced two Christmas tales for the ages, The Bishop's Wife and this one. Though they differ in tone, both reach deeply into human emotions and create experiences that really do border on the miraculous. The story concerns the sudden appearance at Macy's department store in New York City of a man who goes by the name Kris Kringle and claims to be the real Santa Claus. There is conflicting evidence, but Kris (Edmund Gwenn) does seem to have special knowledge about Christmas. And whether he's real or delusional, Mr. Macy (Harry Antrim) wants him on the job because he's getting everyone into the holiday spirit. So it falls upon Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) the store's employee responsible for its annual Thanksgiving Day Parade - whose belief in miracles has been sorely tested by a bad marriage - to host Mr. Kringle for the holiday season. That arrangement brings him into contact with Doris's young daughter Susan (an amazingly good Natalie Wood at 9 years old) and her sympathetic neighbor Fred Gailey (John Payne). Things seem to be going fine when ... well, that's far enough. Just know that the story proceeds to the most delightful courtroom scene ever, and that by the time the movie is over, you just might recover your belief in both Santa and miracles. [Viewing note: This one's available in a colorized version, too, but try to avoid the temptation.] [[ASIN:B00HU8VK4K Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)]]
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is tons of fun! Highly recommend. My favorite is the Arcade version. I got it for free but if I would have played it before that I would have purchased it for sure.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Had very high expectations for this novel but found it to be disappointing and depressing...don't bother if you are expecting &#34;grown up&#34; Harry Potter story.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|His characterizations and how they intertwine with one another is superb.  He provides and insight to history in an entertaining and factual manner all the while using facts and real persons to support his story lines.  I would recommend this novel and this trilogy to everyone who appreciates good reading and suspense.  You will have a difficult time laying the book down.
B00422LESO|4.0|Good read not a great read.  The writing style is good but there were maybe too many sub plots and pairing off for one book.  I am a Jane Austen fan and there were a lot of references throughout the book - if you are not an Austen fan I am not sure you would get it.  I enjoyed it but not enough to purchase the other books in the series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i would recommend  this game to anyone. I love how I can prezonalize my on deck and background . The game is not always easy but sometimes a challange, like solving a puzzle. I love it.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The quandary that all mobile device owners is that you want to protect your shiny new toy from the scrapes and bumps that come with all that mobility.  So, you wrap it in plastic covers and snap it into padded folios until it's almost as bulky and heavy as the laptop it just replaced.  Ultimately, there's no perfect solution to this balancing act - it's up to each person to decide if they want to err on the side of usage or protection.<br /><br />The Marware Revolve folio case is an attractive, versatile example of the bulky end of the spectrum.  The leather exterior is attractive and the soft interior will protect your screen while closed.  The closure is a simple elastic strap, which is nicer than snap or other closures because it maintains a flat profile for your Kindle.<br /><br />Using the Revolve is easy, particularly setting it up as a landscape-oriented stand.  Rotating the Kindle to portrait is pretty stiff, particularly compared to the (more expensive) Targus competitor.  As others have noted, you can't power up the Kindle while it's in the case, but it's easy enough to remove and reseat that this isn't a major issue.<br /><br />Since it has a very professional, formal appearance and it's bulky anyway, it would have been nice to have at least a loop to hold a pen/stylus and/or a small pad of paper (remember paper?).<br /><br />Overall, if you're comfortable with adding some bulk to your Kindle and want an attractive way to keep it very well protected, the Revolve is a great option.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I love monster life it is so cool. and the graphics are great I enjoy it! My brother has the app and he enjoys it to.
0892818875|3.0|This is a strange book.  It is about Aromatherapy but tempts one by claims at many levels which seem to be relating the material to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) at least by vocabulary and allusion.  In short, if you are coming from the TCM angle (not as a newbie) you will be disappointed.  If you are coming from the Aromatherapy angle it will be a hard read if you live in the US.<br /><br />If you've ever read gardening or other books from the UK from the 1980s - 2000s' (this is originally a Gaia Books print from London), it will give you an idea of the use of margins, illustrations, somewhat unusual fonts, and dense paragraph layout.  That means this is not an easy read and it's not a great learning reference book.  It's a book you practically have to read all the way through to begin to crack it.  Then if you recall something (like an ailment or part of the body) it won't be easy to find it.  There is not much in the way of charts which is so non-TCM.  Part Three does break out information based on emotional imbalance, but there is no associated chapter for physical ailment which is conspicuous by it's absence.  So generally, the UK approach to things is not the same as the US approach in terms of easy access to information.  And the book does not really convey the spirit of TCM in it's illustrations or format.<br /><br />If you want something better you can try to find Materia Medica of Essential Oils by Jeffrey Yuen self-published in 2008.  Jeffrey is currently the modern master in the field of TCM and essential oils.  The classic masterwork in this field is clearly Berkowsky's Synthesis Materia Medica/Spiritualis of Essential Oils.  But at $365 that book is out of reach of most people.  There are websites focused on this topic and for now they are a more easily accessible resource than any of these books including the one in review.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is a wonderful story and my six year old loves watching this dvd....A perfect Christmas gift for the six year old groups
0739370693|5.0|Minor proofreading issue. For those ripping these CDs to iTunes, etc., Disk 9 is misspelled as Anitfragile instead of Antifragile. Small point, but it makes the Disk chapter hard to find. Random House should correct this.

B0016BP0PW|5.0|I wasn't familiar with the music of the Beetles.  Across the Universe was a great introduction and entertaining.  A brief history lesson on the events of a time past. I recommend it highly.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|Bought this movie for a xmas present, person who got it loved it and highly recommended this to anyone both product and seller.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatural is one of those shows I can watch over & over. Day in & out.  I've gotten other family memebers & friends to watch the show.  Excellent
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This is a stellar book, well with the $10 or whatever the price is. Wonderfully well written with stories, characters, dialogue, and everything else desired in prose presented in near-perfection.
B00A50PE6K|3.0|I was hoping for more of the popular Glee cast members to be singing lead on the songs, but it was a mixed batch of the background actors and the main/popular characters.  I don't prefer the guys singing as much so I was disappointed there were more than I hoped for.  I like most all things Glee so I purchased this to keep my collection going, and to play some new Christmas music.<br /><br />I hope they show more of Marley.  She should be the new main character. It seems there is no focus this season on a main character like there was when Rachel and Finn were.  There's a lot of jumping back and forth on the episodes.  I digress. :)<br /><br />So this album gets 3 stars, whereas the regular season CDs would get 5 stars from me, as well as past Christmas albums.<br /><br />Adopt a shelter pet.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|We purchased this for our 3 year old daughter, since going out to the movies has become a recently challenge in our household. She absolutely loved it and so did my wife and I.  The movie is beautiful.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It actually took me 2 tries to get into this book but once started I was hooked; each character grabs you with their point of view.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|Really creepy flick. A must watch movie, makes you question the nature of reality and our place inside of it
B00003CXCT|1.0|Unreal. I finally get around to watching and it's NOT the original but instead I have paid nearly $100.00 for the awful, horrible, \\"weirdly inserted crappy updates\\" special effect version. I would never have paid  ANY money for this crapfest. It's as if Jar Jar has walked onto the damn set. It's awful and totally ruining the whole experience. I WILL be returning. UNWATCHABLE.<br /><br />Gross. Thanks for the false advertising butt-wads.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Fifty Shades Freed is a novel that stands on its own. You dont need to necessarily have read the two novels that preceded it.
0756686970|5.0|My grandson is into Legos and Star Wars and wanted this book when he saw it.  I ordered it and saved it for his birthday gift.  He was very excited when he opened the package and saw what it was.
B0076DELIG|4.0|As usual, Michael Connelly has written a great book. Love Harry Bosch. If you haven't read his books yet, start with the first one and work your way through them. You won't regret it!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh at his best!  Beautiful voice, beautiful music, as usual!  Arrangements and backgrounds are varied and enchanting - one of his best albums yet.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|I always enjoy their music. These guys are just absolutely the best. You will thoroughly enjoy. Trust me, please please.
0061537969|5.0|This novel, told from a dog's perspective, is very well written, poignant, funny, sad and quite thought-provoking.  Garth Stein's command of language is superb, and for such a young man, he is possessed of an admirable amount of wisdom.  Most people who happen to be owned by a four-legged creature often wonder what goes through their minds - our dogs and cats can seem to read our thoughts and moods, and have a sixth sense when it comes to our ailments. This novel explores the possible thoughts of one furry child throughout his lifetime. I don't often re-read a book, but this one is too good not to pick up again and again!
B007OV9EYG|5.0|Great movie for ALL ages!! Heart-warming with a great message!!! A must buy for any kid or kid at heart!
1451627297|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  Fascinating concept - we all wonder &#34;What if...&#34; certain things had or hadn't happened.  Most people have looked back on their lives, their history, and wished they could travel back in time to make a different decision, another choice.  But, who knows how things would turn out if it could be done?  This novel explores a very big &#34;What if...&#34; and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The size of the book is daunting, but the reading is very fast - I didn't want it to end.
0345803485|1.0|I cannot add more then other's have written about this horrendous book.  How it became a number one best seller is beyond me.  I felt like I was reading some teenagers diary and nothing more. Completely unrealistic in any fashion.  Better off reading Story of O- wish I had never spent the money on this, how does the author say it, CRAP.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good follow on story to the Bourne franchise. Yes, I miss Matt Damon, (maybe he will come back), but Jeremy did a nice job as the lead.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|this is a great movie for the whole family.may be too scary for young children , but great family fun.
0307744434|1.0|The only thing I liked about this book was the description of the circus. It felt whimsical and fun like a Cirque de Soleil show. Other than that, the story dragged along and after half the book with nothing happening with the two main characters, I quit reading it.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|this is a must for broadway fans , I saw this on broadway and had to add it to my home collection.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As always, Connelly delivers a prime product.  Intelligent as well as exciting reading.  Great characters and superb dialogue and always a superb, and satisfying, ending.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|I've always liked these guys, even lone wolf, however, this movie was an abuse of their former selves, and thus me. Soredogs

B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The momentum from one and two was not able to be maintained. It lacked meaningful story and cohesion. Too many leaps of faith made the story unbelievable.
0385535147|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a Grisham fan, who hasn't put it down since it got here. Says he loves the book.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Works as advertised. Just plug in and start using your firewire devices.<br />I've used this on a macbook air to connect my firewire drives.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Must read is honestly one of the 5 favorite books! The characters are real that you can connect too, the story is amazing and is a real description of teenage life. The ending will take your breath away
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is an exciting page turner that I finished in three days. Would definitely recommend as a must read.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The story line was very engaging and comical at times. I think I would read it again!
B001DDCVCI|4.0|A great product for understanding and appreciating the evolution of John Cash's music over the years. A must for his fans.
B001F12J48|1.0|Old style blue/red 3D that is incompatible with the new 3D TVs. Not sure why it is even being sold as 3D.  Waste of money.
1449410243|3.0|Cute book with very funny and cute pictures of cats. SOme written comments with the picturesd are very funny---others are a bit funny and some are not so funny but if you like cats you will enjoy the book.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Started very strong.  Was laugh out loud funny at times.  But it just went to a darker place and lost some of its steam.  Definitely recommend a viewing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There aren't enough stars to rate this book! It was beyond my expectations! Best book I EVER picked up to read! I am reading the trilogy again...ITS THAT GOOD ;)
B0089IGUKO|5.0|The purists who were packing basements in New Brunswick may not like the direction the band is taking but I always like to see a band change a little and grow.  They aren't 20 year olds making their bones at basement parties anymore so they shouldn't sound like it.<br /><br />I love every Gaslight album so take it for what it is worth but this is a killer album that I can't get enough of.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|I love these movies. God I wish I could dance like that. It was nice to see a set of new faces and also some old ones too. The only thing I was disappointed in is that Mad Chad's dance wasn't up to his usualy standard and neither was Mooses'. Still a great dance flick.
B008O037RG|5.0|When a band like Mumford & Sons comes out of no where to have the success with an album like they did, you will end up getting a lot of haters.  But as a fan of the album you worry about their follow-up falling flat.  Not only doesn't this album fall flat, but it is a brilliant follow-up to Sigh No More.<br /><br />If you like Sigh No More, you'll love this album.  if you don't, this is not going to all of a sudden turn you into a fan.<br /><br />The one knock is as I am reviewing the vinyl, which sounds great, the digital download is worthless.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had misplaced my charger for my Kindle.  Of course, after I had ordered the replacement, I found it!  I will keep the second one for traveling.
B00AAQ7JNA|1.0|I was so happy when i got this Rihanna concert bluray disc! I like her and she is amazing! But once i put the disc in bluray player....... WTF....... What's wrong with my 5.1 sound system?? Really poor sound quality and there is NO LIVE feeling...... I really hope that they can re-work the sound engineering again! Such a great concert!! PLEASE DONT WASTE IT!!......... :(
B004SIIBGU|2.0|It continues to boggle my mind that major vendors such as eBay have no Andriod app targeting tablets.  Compared to the Apple eBay app, this app is very basic with hard to read text and graphics.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I am more of an R&B fan than pop or Top 40.  With that being said, this album is amazing!  It has a little bit of everything:  from Doo-Wop to Regge to Rock and Soul.  Love every song on this album!  100 x's better than his 2010 release!!<br /><br />Also, I'm more of the person who listens to internet radio and a mixture of singles.  I purchased this a couple of days ago and have been listening non-stop!  I highly recommend this purchase!  You will not be disappointed!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I think I was a bit young to 'read this but I LOVED it...:) I think its captures the problems of teenagers.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|I expected more from this movie, but was specially disappointed by Tom Hardy's performance. Not sure what he was trying to accomplish but he barely said a word during the entire movie and when he did, he mumbled. Shia Lebouf didn't do much better either and didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the characters. As for Jessica Chastein, she stuck out like a sore thumb.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The author in depth research and the details she includes in this books transports you to the time of Lincoln as if you were there. Reads like a thriller, just can't put the book down.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This novel is very thought provocing.  A study of children with problems - just as we are dealing with now on an ongoing basis.<br />The novel keeps your attention and is written in a very suspensful page turner.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I was very excited initially to hear this cd considering it was to be produced by Jack Douglas who worked with Aerosmith on all their big 70's albums. But of course they had to throw in a bunch of the crappy ballads written by outside writers because that's where the $$$ is. The hard rockers are pretty cool but the band seems to have lost their swagger from the 70's and will probably never get it back. Too much money and not enough desperation leads to &#34;safe&#34; music. These guys used to be a band to fear with how hard they could rock but now it's all just worthless &#34;product&#34; with no attitude. Saw them live at Madison Square Garden recently too and at least live there was some of that cool factor. The performances were spot on but I guess it's in the studio is where they need to figure out how to capture that magic again. Sadly this is rumored to be their last cd.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator. Like I said, it is great and the price is right...free. can't say enough good about it.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|Not really what I expected from Sir Paul but all the quiet jazz tunes are striking in how good they are. Guests like Diana Krall and Eric Clapton make this a great cd of jazzy classics and some new compositions. My Valentine being my favorite.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Don't watch if you scare easy.  Or if your imagination runs away from you.  Do not skip any episodes for maximum bang.
B009E3EY38|5.0|If only they could have toured after this! I would finally be able to see one of my favorite bands playing at their utmost best. Surprisingly, these guys somehow managed to continue to be relevant and play like their lives depended on it and the results were inspiring to say the least. The quality of the recording is beyond compare. The &#34;rehearsal footage&#34; was interesting but the one camera from 100 feet away is pretty boring. The actual show is incredible. A must have for classic rock fans!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Prieviews can be deceiving sometimes....this is the case here....such adolescent humor, teens will love it maybe.  Too bad, hoped for more....love Wahlberg, not his finest hour(s)....
B0076DELIG|5.0|One of Connellys best. Harry certainly works hard to track down the guilty persons responsible. RIGHT UP TO THE END I COULD NOT GUESS WHAT THE OUTCOME WOULD BE.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|'Snow White and the Huntsman....'<br /><br />Having paid $17 in New Zealand to see this at the movies, as I was watching it I was left wondering....\\"where's the Huntsman? Why is it called 'Snow White AND THE Huntsman'?<br /><br />WHAT HUNTSMAN?<br /><br />The Pros:<br /><br />* The set was excellent.  Every location made you feel something.  The colouring was superb, the bleak, medieval tone of the movie was fantastic.<br /><br />* The dwarves.  Excellently cast.<br /><br />* Special effects.  It actually didn't even look like special effects.  Capturing the feel of the movie was spot on.  There was no real distinction between reality and computer animation.<br /><br />* Costumes.  Every outfit worn complimented the tone of the movie and the period it was set in.  Since Colleen Atwood was the designer, I don't expect anything less than awesome from her.  Charlize's character had the most amazing, luxurious, gothic pieces I've ever seen in a movie.  The movie really was simply beautiful to watch.<br /><br />* Charlize Theron (though I don't consider her a great actress, apart from her role in Monster) played an amazing bad guy.  She captured veiled evil perfectly.  Her beautiful face masks the evil within perfectly so you never know what kind of reaction she'll give at any given time.<br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />* No real 'action'.  Even though there was supposed to be a 'battle' coming along sometime, there was no build-up.  My heart didn't beat faster, there was no anticipation.  The few battle scenes there were, were simply 'ok'.  The troll/ogre scene was fantastically done.  That was probably the best action sequence of the whole movie.  Think of the battle at Rohan in LOTR.  This was a blockbuster that you could FEEL the build-up.<br /><br />* No romance/chemistry between Snow White and the Huntsman.  Hence why I was questioning 'why is this called 'Snow White and the Huntsman?'' all the way through.  The Huntsman didn't come along into the movie until way past the start, Snowy and him didn't have any real interraction or connection (or maybe due to the locations they couldn't get to know each other more intimately).  I felt more chemistry between Snowy and the dwarves. And that single kiss was awkward.<br /><br />* The rousing of the troops was one of the most awkward scences I've ever seen in a movie.  I put that all down to Kristin Stewart's relied upon 'stuttering', her one dimensional characters and acting, and her one face (you know which face I'm talking about - where she stares out blankly at 'you' like a meth addict with her mouth slightly agape showing her two front teeth).  She certainly picked up right were Twilight left off.  She plays the same character.  Throw Snowy in Twilight and you realise the characters are interchangable.  Like another poster on here, she was picked because of her popularity with a niche market.  To the rest of us that are not interested in the Twilight series or what it respresents to a certain demographic, we expect more.  I feel that an 'unknown' Snowy would have been better.  Someone that can capture emotion at the right time and make us feel something.  I felt nothing for Snowy.<br /><br />* The ending was dismal to say the least.  In fact, when the credits started rolling I was sitting there, blinking, thinking 'where's the ending?'.  I was expecting Snowy to run up to the Huntsman, who stood at the far back so no one could see him, throw her arms around him and passionately kiss him....and end up happily ever after.  This is supposedly a battled, more exaggerated version of the Snowy Disney movie (which I felt was actually darker and scarier than this average 'blockbuster'), so I felt a little romantic licence could be allowed for.  But just when she's looking at him (how did she earn the place of queen again???) with that meth face, the credits roll.  HUH???<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />It wasn't a bad movie by any standards.  Effort and money went into this and in manyparts, it shows and it was well done.  But when it's touted as a blockbuster with a title like Snow White and the Huntsman, 1) I expect a blockbuster with excellent dialogue, 2) I expect an awesome ending, 3) I expect a passionate love story (there WAS no 'and the Huntsman', they weren't a 'and the' FFS!!!), and 4) I expect lots of awesome action and battle scenes.  The pros mentioned above bring my rating back up and simply make it 'average'.parts, it shows and it was well done.

B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Too much story, not enough funny stuff- pretty simple story line that really goes just how you think it will
1609611543|5.0|using the info and see results already in just two weeks. have more energy and pants getting looser and joints felling better.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|It's. similar to I spy.  Very addictive!  I didn't want to put it down.  The game has different levels some are puzzles some are memory games.
B00632HWOG|1.0|worked great until I upgraded.  now it won't do anything.  I removed the app and then reinstalled it.  the problem. is still there.  it really sucks! !!!!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I grew up watching this movie - it's how we begin our Christmas season on Thanksgiving afternoon. It was about time I owned my own copy. Anyone who has ever tried to host or simply attended a family holiday get-together with great expectations can related to this. These actors playing Audrey and Rusty are the best out of the 4 Griswold vacation movies. You can see Rusty on Big Bang Theory all grown up now.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it works at it should.  no unnecessary weird kindle functioning after installed.  nice big keys.  it is easy to use.
B000A6EXNO|5.0|Don't follow the instructions on how to put on. They are crap anyway.<br /><br />If your using the DK-17M, put it behind the eyepiece. You should be able to read the made in japan and nikon DK-17m markings. Use the shallow ring that came with your camera behind the rubber eyecup. Screw it on your camera.<br /><br />If you don't do this, it will not stop coming off. This way looks better, fits better and never falls off.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great books....can't put them down!!!! I really hope they make a movie of this trilogy...it would be another twilight hit!!!
0142421375|5.0|My child went to a mock trial when she was in 4th grade. Before she went she read Theodore Boone. She loves going to the courthouse now cause of the Theodore. It's great to have a fictional character that a child can relate to.  In the story Theodore goes to the courthouse all the time cause his parents are lawyers. I told my child I can take her to the courthouse anytime she wants. She excitedly said &#34;Really&#34;?  We go to the traffic court and watch what happens and how people behave. Thank you John Grisham for writing a wonderful entertaining book.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I would give this 4.5 stars if that were a possible rating.  The dystopian future setting presented is sadly believable and more than makes up for the less than spectacular games themselves.  I have not read the books, but am looking forward to the rest of the trilogy
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Oh you all know with all the yucky news in the world we NEED more of Tina Fey. She's just the best writer.  I love to ready comedy.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|A satisfying conclusion to the series that is light years better than the Deathly Hallows Part 1 (which was the worst of the series)
B003O86FMW|4.0|This one is definitely the most exciting of the three books.  there is action, drama, and romance...everything a good book needs.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This was a more coherent movie than the first with a well played and appropriate villan and better written story
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|a real page turner, wanted to see how it ended up, so that might have helped me read it faster
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|This is a good continuation of the series, but still left me waiting for the promise of the series to be fullfilled
B002ZG981E|5.0|This is definitely one of the best films in the last couple of years.  DiCaprio is turning out to be one of the great actors of our time.  Nolan gives his films a dark, yet artistic and interesting effect.  You might have to watch it a second or third time to understand and keep track of the different &#34;Levels&#34;.  Definitely a must buy!
B005LAIH9A|4.0|This is a pleasant enjoyable movie, but it is not as funny as the original films (especially 1 and 2)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This was fun and entertaining.  I like the twist of using Star Wars related 'attacks' through out the game and the other fun gimmicks as well
B001OQCV6A|4.0|This is a good but sometimes disjointed action movie in which Downey plays his typical but enjoyable sarcastic / cynical character
B00AE2J93I|4.0|The movie had a great lesson that we need to learn or a reminder for it.  The  chacters were very well done.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, but found myself wishing throughout that it had incorporated the original lorax story intact rather than be simply based on it
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This is really a fun game w/ 3 different options.  &#34;Old school&#34; pinball from the 1970's.  And, it's free which is the best price
B004EPZ07U|4.0|This was a fun popcorn movie that is fairly typical of the modern superhero genre.  It has good humor and special effects
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun brain exercise I use when I need to &#34;reboot&#34; my brain.  I love the bright colors.
B005ZKYXZI|4.0|I was not expecting much when I first watched this movie but was pleasantly surprised.  The kid is a bit annoying at times, but Hugh and the robots make up for it
0545265355|4.0|Well, by now, who hasn't heard of the Hunger Games? It's been a few years since I purchased this book set as a gift for my daughter, so I know I am late and oh so behind the times, but I would recommend these books for parents of kids maybe aged 10 or 11 and up to read. They aren't the best written books--not very descriptive or written very intelligently, for lack of a better word, but they are interesting.  They do get progressively worse as far as reading as well and the last one seems to have been rushed to print as I found even grammatical errors in it, but as far as an easy read for teens, this is so popular and fairly safe. There are some sad parts in these books so I would not recommend any child younger than 10 read these books but older than that, they are likely fine (unless your child is subject to nightmares or something like that).
B005LAIHGI|4.0|This is my favorite of the Cohen movies, it is generally funny throughout without the low spots of his other movies
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a fun game to play. Just wish you got more daily rewards before you have to buy them
B004LWZW7E|5.0|I had not heard of this movie till it was released on video, but its vision of a dystopian future is disturbing for its parallels to our current wealth centered society
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I'm a fan of smallville, and almost all super hero movies/tv shows. I really like Arrow, it's awesome show, and i even got my roommate and mom started on the series. If your a fan or the good guy bad guy theme then you should defiantly watch this =)
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I was surprised at how much I liked this movie.  The action is great, the humor is funny, and the story is fun.
0385344228|5.0|Great twist and good overall storyline.  Might consider another title because it was a give away from the beginning.  Looking forward to your future material.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's fun and consumes a lot of time before you know it.  Plus it is a free game after all.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|I love the bottle it came in.. The disc's are inside the bottom of the bottle. It's a really neat gift idea
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Great songs, performances, production, and sound. Best new rock band of the year by a long ways, and required listening for all music fans.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Definitely a good modern twist on a classic novel. It's interesting to see the dynamic between Holmes and Watson.  Even more interesting that they chose to have Watson be female instead of male.  I think it adds a good dynamic.
B00688628M|5.0|Tough to watch, but it was meant to be that way.  Fantastic movie that makes you feel as though you're there.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was especially taken with the backstory of Christian Gray and how he became the way he was.  This book brought the story to a conclusion that included the psychological part of the story.  I especially enjoyed that.
B001FXCE46|5.0|An album I can listen to the whole way through because it's that good.  As well, I was really happy to pay less than $3 for one of my favorites!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I have 3 girls, 9, 6, and 3, there is something they all like on this game, and that makes things easier for me, you can play if your patient with out spending money and the graphics are adorable. Have fun and get Littlest pet shop for your children to enjoy:)
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|love the contemporary spin on this.  Don't want to see them get involved too soon. At some point you know its going to happen, maybe in a dream sequence?
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|Dvd didn't come with cover on the disc,but the quality of the movie is great. I received the movie pretty quick
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I didn't have this game and was surprised to see I could get it free and am already having a ball playing.  Thanks!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Great movie to have in your dvd collection.  Full of action, laughs, and actors from the past.  Worth watching and buying.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Very confusing movie.  No comparision to Matt Damon.  Hope he come back for the next one.<br />Love the other Bourne Movies.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book keeps you wanting to read. I won't lie, sometimes skipped through the descriptions of things just to finish this book.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I thought this was going to be a comedy but found it was more of a emotional based love story. I found the characters to be 'real' and enjoyed it very much.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 doesn't disappoint. it carries on with the same excellent acting, writing, costumes, etc. as the previous seasons. I am looking forward to the next season.
0064430227|5.0|Sent to our Irish grandson and he loves it!  Hope it sparks his five year old creation!  This book was after I was raising children so went with the recommended books and it appears - it was a HIT!
0670026182|5.0|This book has some great recipes for every occasion.  (I particularly love the salads!). But it is more than just that. It has some of the best food photography that I have ever seen. The pictures are just stunning and great food jumps out at every page. The presentation is far superior to your average cookbook and the stories behind the recipes give the book a real personal and homely feel. This book not only belongs in the kitchen but also on the coffee table. Perhaps I should order a second copy!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you loved &#34;Slammed&#34; and &#34;Point of Retreat&#34;, you will more than love this book!  The subject content is heavier and the story is completely well rounded!  Follow it full circle, you will not be disappointed!  I highly recommend it for older folks... 17 and up.  There's language, sex, and heavy subject discussion.  But it's extremely believable and you will not want to put it down!  Loved this book!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Ignore the one and two star ratings.  This one of DeMille's best works.  It is a very detailed account  of a mission to Yemen to track down a US born AQ leader,responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole.<br />It goes into a lot of  detail and if you stay with it, you will be glad you did.  I almost abandoned this book because I too was expecting another Lion's game and was disheartened by the negative reviews.  However, when I read a five star review from a published writer and got a better understanding of the book, I read on.<br />DeMille is the best.<br />Although a first person narrative by John Corey annoyed a lot of readers with his cynical wit and sarcasm, Corey is a believable character and the product of long years as a New York homicide detective.  Seeing all of this unfold through his POV adds a lot to the book.<br />I think calling DeMille lazy in a one star review is astonishing.  Maybe the four and five star reviewers should kick in a few cents each and refund the one star reviewers, so they can buy a book more to their liking
B0019UGYK0|1.0|dvd would not play in blue ray or regular dvd-Region error. I tried  it in multiple dvd that are known to work.It always said region error.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This is a quirky story that had that &#34;can't put it down effect&#34;<br />Recommended for an unusual, fast moving read.
159420411X|5.0|I heard about Nate Silver and his prediction prowess at 538.org before I purchased the book, so I had high expectations from the book, and I am happy to say that it did not disappoint. The book is very well researched and contains discussions about problems in prediction involving baseball, poker, chess, politics as well as earthquakes, weather and terrorism. It nicely conveys the basics of Bayesian thinking and general guidelines for making good predictions through the use of case studies and anecdotes, illustrated with graphs and charts where applicable. No math formulae is involved, although a basic knowledge of probability and arithmetic would probably help. In short, a very approachable and informative book for non-statisticians looking for insight into the techniques of prediction.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|Ok, so wait, I think there might be people who don't realize that this movie is a joke?  Or..... is it?
B001AQO3QA|5.0|All the alien movies in one unique package. I love how the box design is. Very unique. Video is top notch; and sound.
1400069289|5.0|Habits are things that can raise us up to the pinnacle of heaven or plunge us to the depths of misery. The author examines the habit loop and gives a thorough analysis of how it impacts our life and how we can use this influence to make positive changes. Thorough research was done in the writing of this book. Companies like Starbucks, Febreze, Pepsodent and and Alcoa were looked at as models of success and how the habit loop works. They also make for very entertaining reading on what might be a very dry subject.<br /><br />The part of the brain responsible for habits is the basal ganglia, not memory. The habit loop itself is a circular model that starts with a cue,then proceeds with a routine and then finishes with a reward. To create positive habits and /or eradicate new habits one must tweak the elements of the habit loop. The most effective habit changes involve modifying the routine part of the habit loop. In a sense you are already modifying a current habit. So to start a new habit you need to get in a new routine. Before the advent of Pepsodent, people really did not brush their teeth. Yeah that meant bad breath and a film over your teeth. Gross and yuck and yeah the nation suffered from poor hygiene.  To sell toothpaste though you needed a new habit and yeah this one caught on. The reward part was manipulated here and thee reward was white teeth (which could be obtained by eating an apple) and that sharps sparkling taste in  your mouth when you are done. The lather in shampoo serves the same function. Febreze used it as well. It was discovered on accident in a lab. It did such a great job killing odors that once you used it you put it in the closet and forgot about it. Not great for sales so you tweak the reward. After a good cleaning people liked a heavily perfumed spray just to finish things off. The company modified the formula.<br /><br />But sometimes changing the routine is not enough. In alcoholics anonymous  which is a spiritual program they work with two or three things. One is the inventory which helps you identify the cues that make you want to drink. The second part is belief, you have to believe that things can get better . That is where the belief in a higher power comes in. Another example of belief playing a role was the team called the Bucs, a losing football team. The coach came in and taught them to memorize a few key plays by wrote. They drilled these routines to death until they knew them cold. They were successful all the way until the finals and then they started slipping up. They did not win the super bowl and the coach ended up transferring to another team he repeated the same process but with the new team something changed. The change was a a death in the coaches family of his son. It forced the team to pull together and believe. They won the super bowl. Belief and a support group.<br /><br />Starbucks has one of the best training programs hands down and they treat their employees right. The training not only gives them great work skills some of which can be used for college credit but they also give you life skills. One worker could not even hold down a job. He was the product of a broken family and his inner anger lead to temper flare ups at work among other things. Starbucks had something called a notebook where you write up a problem that arises then you write down your solution to the problem and then you practice it. This guy ended up getting a position in management. Bravo Starbucks. The book also analyzes how Howard Schultz bought the company and built it up to what it is today.<br /><br />A new CEO steps up at Alcoa. He totally shocks everyone by telling them he is going to focus on safety. A real turn off because people really care about money not worker safety. The CEO sets up a communication system that allows for employees to communicate with their supervisors and even the CEO himself. It also calls for interdepartmental communication. They end up with a near perfect safety recordand they also boost productivity and stock values soar. This shows the power of changing key habits to change the over all scene.<br /><br />An analysis of how markets work is included by showcasing how Target Dept. Stores use computer to track consumer spending habits so they could determine which coupon they should send to you. They were so accurate that it creeped out the customer. Solution make it appear more random, so instead of sending a pregnant woman a bunch of ads for diapers and baby products they would mix it up with ads and coupons for a lawn mower. Make everything regular and familiar. Of course they use this to sell you stuff you will want in the future even before you know you'll want it. Familiarity and regularizes also help hit songs become successful.<br /><br />The last two chapters focus on societal habits by examining the growth of the Saddle Back Church and the Montgomery bus strike involving Rosa Parks. This first chapter puts the leadership not in the hand of one person but in the hands of the people and it works. The Saddle back Church focuses on small weekday study groups that meet in people's homes with or without the pastor. In the Montgomery Bus strike it showed the power of Personal Connections and also what is called weak links or what I call loose associations. We know it as peer pressure to invoke change.<br /><br />Finally there is the trick Casinos use.They reward you with all  sorts of bonuses to get you to come to their casino. The flush of winning, free travel feel good. You also end up gambling away your life savings. Are you free to stop are you compelled to keep gambling. The story is contrasted to night terrors and sleep walking. Habit happen unconsiously when we sleep. fortunately for most our brain paralyzes us so we cannot move but for other they at function does not works. The subconscious is free to cause you to sleep walk, act out in violent fear. Force of habit.and they also boost productivity and stock values soar. This shows the power of changing key habits to change the over all scene.<br /><br />An analysis of how markets work is included by showcasing how Target Dept. Stores use computer to track consumer spending habits so they could determine which coupon they should send to you. They were so accurate that it creeped out the customer. Solution make it appear more random, so instead of sending a pregnant woman a bunch of ads for diapers and baby products they would mix it up with ads and coupons for a lawn mower. Make everything regular and familiar. Of course they use this to sell you stuff you will want in the future even before you know you'll want it. Familiarity and regularizes also help hit songs become successful.<br /><br />The last two chapters focus on societal habits by examining the growth of the Saddle Back Church and the Montgomery bus strike involving Rosa Parks. This first chapter puts the leadership not in the hand of one person but in the hands of the people and it works. The Saddle back Church focuses on small weekday study groups that meet in people's homes with or without the pastor. In the Montgomery Bus strike it showed the power of Personal Connections and also what is called weak links or what I call loose associations. We know it as peer pressure to invoke change.<br /><br />Finally there is the trick Casinos use.They reward you with all  sorts of bonuses to get you to come to their casino. The flush of winning, free travel feel good. You also end up gambling away your life savings. Are you free to stop are you compelled to keep gambling. The story is contrasted to night terrors and sleep walking. Habit happen unconsiously when we sleep. fortunately for most our brain paralyzes us so we cannot move but for other they at function does not works. The subconscious is free to cause you to sleep walk, act out in violent fear. Force of habit.
B0027MJU00|5.0|After Gone Girl, which was as good a book as I've read in a decade (reminded me of Scott Turow's &#34;Presumed Innocent&#34;), I immediately bought Flynn's other two books. Dark Places features typically Flynn-crafted damaged characters wrapped in a mystery to solve.  Outstanding stuff.  And not just a &#34;genre writer&#34;.  Flynn wows with her literary chops which carve beautiful prose throughout.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas, it was less than half the price at good ol wally world
B007UK81FO|5.0|the pictures of the backstage stories are wonderful, the description of the main characters accurate, looking forward to new releases
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas, it was less than half the price @ good ol wally world
B008N1LL42|3.0|This is a movie that could have been very entertaining if the story wasn't so awful.  Truly, if the producers wanted to use the USS Missouri, why not set the story during or after WW2?  Once the action gets going, the movie is very watchable and the gripes about the horrible plot points and poor character development become moot.  Definitely worth watching once.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|The detail exposure of the cabinet's functioning at that early stage gives insight into today's Washington political actors' roles. I never realized what an extraordinary individual was President Abraham Lincoln.
B005PK553C|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised I've been waiting for a good modern Horror Story.  I'm not sure how much farther they can go with this plot line now that main characterrs are ghosts.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The story as told by the family dog is unique.  His perspective of the lives of his people is spot on.  I particularly like his explanation of why dogs don't have thumbs.  I was barely able to put it down.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to You is an amazing book. You won't want to put this book down. Eva and Gideon's dysfunctional relationship is addicting and heart wrenching. I will definitely be doing a second reading on Bared to You!
B000VDDDVO|3.0|Color version - nothing but skips & scratches -not 'playable'.  B & W plays fine.  Classic Christmas favorite!  First time ordering online.
B009ZE27US|1.0|I was about to cry.  it sucks.  I'm serious,each time I played it it was WRONG!!!!!! what the crap ,I was about to punch the screen. thank God I didn't because I had to make this terrible review.bla bla your 50 years old WRONG!!!!!! if any body ever gives this a five star review I cant believe it. they have to be LYING there's no way. if you read this sorry its so long its just this app is so stupid.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|MSNBC, are you joking? If this is where The Avengers get their news info we are truly doomed. Who are the bad guys?? Almost as bad as Batman \\" The Dark Knight Rises\\".
0316232955|5.0|i was able to see this film at the world premiere in nyc at the tribeca film festival last april, and i rented it for a second viewing last night.  it's even better the second time!  chris colfer is a brilliant writer and actor, and i'm very much looking forward to his future projects.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Renner is really good, but have to give it to Weisz for making the movie work. Ed Norton is always good carrying the complicated story along. But, in the end, Weisz pulls it off.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Personally, I loved this movie. It is by far the most action packed film I've seen in awhile, plus a bit of comedy to go along with it
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|As a type II diabetic, I have learned the information about our diet from doctors and this book is dead on. The over processed food that we eat is killing us. Most of the &#34;fat&#34; in people is the swelling from our bodies reacting to the crap in our food. We ignore our own evolutionary dietary needs with convenient garbage that we should not be consuming. The medical establishment complicates the issues with well intended &#34;fads&#34; that have lead many people into the wrong diets.
B0091XRRQC|5.0|This movie is appropriate for all ages, there is humor for both adults and children. Plus it has the added bonus of not being sad like many Disney movies.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|A lot of fun to watch! Love the hulk and the way he deals with the invaders. Iron man was great!
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I thought this would be perfect for my needs.  unfortunately, this was not the case.  It was difficult to use and didn't really have functionality.  I deleted it from my Kindle as useless.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|I think this is the same story as Twilight as far as I could stomach it. Although I will say, far better acting than that other schlock.
B0051CSIKQ|3.0|This was not the best vampire movie I have seen but then it was not the worst. Chance of watching it again 40%
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Good story.. Far better than the last grizzly mess. Will Smith has the ability to reflect the every man and deserves a lot of credit in carrying this off. Brolin was great as usual with his Tommy Lee rendition and Tommy Lee is always cool.
B005LAII3U|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Fast-paced, plenty of action, and Kate Beckinsale.  That deserves repeating...Kate Beckinsale.<br /><br />Neither of the discs would play the movie.  One disc had the usual disclaimers and FBI/Interpol notices and the other had previews. Both went dark after those displayed and nothing I tried would bring the movie up. My firmware on the player was up-to-date. Given that the previews and notices played without a problem I suspect that what I received were blanks that never had the movie installed, which would make it a quality control issue with the manufacturer.<br /><br />I returned the discs to Amazon for a replacement.  That process works really well.
B00846TRHY|4.0|Butler as HillBilly? I dont know. However, I have liked Butler in everything he has done and this is no exception. Good story and well done. The truth about the story is even better.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Am a huge Van fan, have all his dozens of records, this is the best studio one of the more recent vintage (like last 20 years, maybe since &#34;Enlightenment&#34;).  If you love Van you have to get this one.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|OK story, Del Toro is always great! Salma Hayek is really good as the head of the Cartel. Typical Oliver Stone story kind of falls flat like he doesn't know how to end a story.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I have read all the diary of wimpy kid series since I was in third grade.my friends and I have always had great laughs while reading these. I would recommend this for all ages even if your 85 you will still laugh. Jeff Kinney is just amazing and very imaginative.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|this is true riding music, just let it play.... I love it just like all of his other work! great job Tip!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Stephen King's 11/23/63 doesn't take a moment longer than any of his previous releases to set bait and hook, trapping readers into a page turning frenzy with this historical novel.  While initially pondering how a major American tragedy could be turned in a Stephen King twister I was quickly caught up in the conundrum set before us.  Catch up on your sleep well before cracking this book's cover.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love it this game is awesome. This is one of the best games I have ever played. Everyone should play this game
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family, its very hard to take your eyes away from this one. I would recommend this movie to friends and family.
B002WJI658|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I received this,the details are great and It looks just like the Photo. A must have for someone who loves all the mario characters. Wrapped under the tree I can't wait for my son to open it he will love it.
B00456H5LC|5.0|loved every song! would def. suggest this album. Worth every penny! Bruno is incredible! buy this, buy this! You won't be sorry.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It a cool game my family love to play and yep i would say go for it and maybe you and your family will enjoy it to..
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next Avengers film!  Great dialogue.  Great storyline.  Great acting.  Forget Batman and the rest....&#34;there can be only one!&#34;
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It clear and easy and work for me i used it all the time and yes i would tell other to go for it ..
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love this game!!  Very addictive!! The graphics are great. Can this came be done in three D ??? That would be great!
B008FRFN7A|1.0|it just didn't work on my kindle fire i quest some can and some can't used it just try it..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I purchased this product because it appeared to be an interesting game. It only took a few minutes and I was hooked!
B004SBULWE|5.0|Well like you say you need protection well here one for you and it work so far any way and yes i would tell my family...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I chose a rating of  five because it is God' s Word. It is also the best electronic version I've foundfound.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Look, this show is amazing.  All that see it truly will become addicted.  I am so glad that a Masterpiece Theater program has received so much praise. Maybe this will shut up the Republicans who threaten to cut funding to PBS.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'm so glad that I can have Facebook any where I go!!  I most definitely recommend this product to every one I know
B008DL466C|1.0|All of my friends told me that Wiz has lost it and his new album (O.N.I.F.C.) is gonna suck. I have been waiting anxiously for this album to release and didn't want to believe what everyone was telling me about it. Well everyone was right, this album sucks! I don't know what happened to Wiz but he has definitely lost it. This album is complete trash and is not worth my time and money! Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app. I use it many times each day. You can get weather to your exact area and others you choose.
B0011U38PM|5.0|This album is a Must Have for your collection.  Every song is fantastic!<br />You can't go wrong with Bob Marley!
B0063IH60K|5.0|For me solitaire is a classic. This is a great app that works great on my kindle fire. Great way to pass the time.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I don't think this lived up to the quality of the rest of the franchise. The whole movie was just a kind of reset for the characters. It was good compared with your average popcorn chomper, but it didn't compare well with the other Bourne movies. Maybe the next one will make it worth it.
B0086700CM|3.0|I thought this would be awesome due to the reviews but running around for 10 min doesn't excite me.Its the same thing over and over.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not the greatest literature out there but the book is a real pageturner. But would recommend reading the book before seeing the movie.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I thought I try this out but what is the point. Pin up pictures you like? Seems very stupid. Maybe I just am missing the point if anyone cares to explain this to me.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Captivating!  Riveting!!! Glad I purchased this book. I was hooked on page 1! It really pulls you in tongue story!
B008EQIEWS|4.0|greeks, gods & s*** its ok but thats about it. good for a 11 year old. not much more. thats all
B0052RDHTM|5.0|It is a must read and I am now on the 2nd book and can hardly wait to get the 3rd one.<br />I would recommend this to all. I enjoy Ken Follett's books<br />Yetive
B0044XV3R8|5.0|done, its good no more no more no more no more no more no more no more no more no more.NO MORE!
B005HSL626|5.0|I ordered this for my granddaughter.  She loves it and so does my grandson.  It is fun to watch them enjoying the game.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|van the man what else can you say. when did he put out a bad album they want too much crap on this. a simple ok will do!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I saw this in theaters and liked it enough to rent it when it came out, but the sound was horrible. There is no captioning option and the background noise and music overpower the spoken words making it impossible to enjoy.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|again the cd is ok. no more words this is why i don't like to do this. if its my opion why so many words i bought it. to me ok is good enough.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Eye of the Needle Excellent! Suspenseful! I enjoyed it very much, as I do all of Ken Follets works. Bravo Bravo
B008X9Z4I8|4.0|I like this sleeve because of it's color and the fact that it's thick enough to really protect my kindle.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is a great time killer and pretty easy for a hidden object game. some items are pretty small and hard to see but that's the challenge
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Saw Shins story on 60 minutes and had to get the book. I still find it hard to believe--though I know it was accurate. How can we allow this to go on with upwards of 100,000 people allowed to live like animals. I have recommended this book to every one I know.  Tremendous readin,but not for the faint of heart or little children.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|If you have ever had to admit your child isn't perfect, you can identify with this story. If you have children and haven't done that, then you should definitely read this.  The complexities of the situation are enormous and the book does a fairly good job. The writing itself was not the greatest but not bad either. Reading it a couple of weeks before the school Shooting in Connecticut has certainly added to its importance.
B001DE29SS|5.0|Great movie about the wonderful Charlie Chaplin. Robert Downey Jr. did a phenomenal job in portraying him. Definitely a movie worth watching.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|I was thinking the movie would be cute for the family, but was very surprised with all the drug use in the movie.  It's not a movie for children or people that are not into drugs.  Yuck :(
0062124293|2.0|I picked this book for book club thinking it would be great for conversation as we are a mix of housewives, stay at home mom's, some part-time workers, some full-time workers and one bread winner. I wasn't able to get though the book! I don't recommend it, I didn't know what the heck she was talking about most of the time and was bored or disgusted. I never made it out of adolescence though, maybe it gets better. I love to read, but not when it feels like a chore and I am forcing myself to continue. With this book, I was forcing myself and finally gave up.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|“The sky is always beautiful. Even when it’s dark or rainy or cloudy, it’s still beautiful to look at. It’s my favorite thing because I know if I ever get lost or lonely or scared, I just have to look up and it’ll be there no matter what...and I know it’ll always be beautiful.&#34;<br /><br />I'm utterly speechless. Colleen Hoover is an exceptional writer. She won me over with the Slammed series and Hopeless is the icing on the cake.<br /><br />This book had so many layers that blended together so seamlessly, I was lost in it, and frankly did not want to be found. This is an intense book that will keep you tip toeing around every corner and offering a slam to the gut when you make your way around each one. It will awe you, mortifying you, and inspire you to the depth of your soul. This book is not a typical romance but rather an experience that you won't soon forget.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|Very good story but they their gun fight was childish and improbable. Why ruin a good movie with this impossible gun fight, as if police would shoot back if there were civilians in the area.
0064430227|5.0|Got this as a reward for my grandson when he was completely potty-trained and he loved having it read to him over and over and over!!!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|It is an amazing coincidence that all the aristocrats are stupid and the working class great patriots and politicians. Lenin and Stalin make out pretty well in this history fiction of the cause of the world war. The love story was trite and predicable.
B0001I562I|5.0|One of the best movies ever made!  My kids loved this when they were little and I got it for their kids to watch and they love it, too!
B009ZE27US|1.0|Terrible times 10. Well I knew it wouldn't work but at least they could of kept the first age they guessed for you. 1st I was 41 then 21 then 47 then 34. ha.
B0031TZASY|5.0|Well-written, fun, and hard to put down.  I really loved it and wish it had never ended. Working with animals myself, the book was very believable!
B0018RVJWM|5.0|Good book.  It was a book for my son's English class.  He enjoyed the book.  The book was in great condition.
B00005LOUP|5.0|The Grinch knows what its all about and its not presents twenty four seven,  its about love and family and Jesus.
096501746X|5.0|Good book.  It was a book for my son's English class.  He enjoyed the book.  The book was in great condition.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Season 10 is very convenient.  I love having my own marathon and I don't have to wait for the DVDs.  The season is shaping up well.<br /><br />The best part - Ducky's back!!!<br /><br />Looking forward to the remaining episodes.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I watched the movie and that was the reason that I ordered the CD - however we have not viewed the cd yet.
B0073COMKW|5.0|When I bought this light I was skeptical that it would deliver like the product description.<br />I was looking for a LED Bulb because they last much longer.  Don't let the small size fool you.  This light is extremely bright.  My shipping experience was painless.  Am planning on buying more.
0066620996|5.0|This is a hard to read book.  It is a good book to have around and good for a work setting.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to install &amp; set up, simple to use, and extremely practical &amp; accurate... well, at least as accurate as weather prediction can be... :)
0446310786|5.0|Good book.  It was a book for my son's English class.  He enjoyed the book.  The book was in great condition.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day knocked it out of the park with this Crossfire novel.  I couldn't put it down.  It was just naughty enough to steam you up but not be over the top embarrassing as some books are.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn is the best author of thrilling novels to come along in ages.  Her storytelling is unique, graphic, realistic.  It exposes the underbelly of life in the current United States with harsh truisms.  She dares speak the unspeakable.  Her stories are thoroughly believable unless the reader has been living their life in a Cosmo magazine world or via Facebook.  I tried to describe one of her book to a person at a cocktail party recently and they looked at me like I came from an alternate universe.  Flynn's books may not be for everybody and everybody does not like to see life and relationships as they truly exist.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again Vince Flynn has hit a homerun  his books just keep getting better and better.  And I have read every book he has writtsen.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn does it again!  Girl Gone is far different from her first two novels.  I loved the unique narrative style used by the author.  Flynn is by far, my favorite author of novels in ages.  The reader continues to ponder the book long after reading it.  Flynn's characters are believable.  The reader feels that they personally have known the main characters for years.  The twists and turns make Flynn's book impossible to put down.  The reader becomes sad when they know, by their Kindle that they are 94% through the book, yet cannot wait to know how the story ends.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Too many authors are writing words to fill pages because the story line is not very strong.. Just too many people trying to be writers many  I believe.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is not often a mystery keeps me guessing, but this one did.  The characters were well-developed and the author alternately made you love and hate the main characters.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great product good price and fast!! Blue ray alone is worth it and u get the sound track and 3d and regular disk plus digital down load for your phone..
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Of the three books this was my favorite though as a whole the series is just ok. This book had a little more action and intrigue in it which made it my favorite.<br />These stories to me seemed a bit confused to me though, almost as if they were having an identity crisis.<br /><br />If I were to write the review as just general romantic fiction I would say they were actually pretty good though honestly the sex scenes started getting in the way of the story line at times, almost as if the author were trying to use them as filler.<br /><br />If I were to write the review as general erotica, I would say it would have been good as one novel or even a short story as the sex scenes at some point became repetitive and predictable. You know, like married sex, lol.<br /><br />If I were to write the review as BDSM erotica…..I would honestly have to say it sucked. Bad. Honestly, if this were to be marketed as purely BDSM erotica I would want a refund!
B00AHXDECG|5.0|After loving Bruno Mars' last cd, I wondered if he could come close....well, he has far surpassed it!  Great CD!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|1. I didn't like Zombie movie.<br />2. I didn't like redneck.<br />3. I didn't like hunting.<br />4. I didn't like TV show made after comic book.<br />BUT, I love everything about this show.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I'm not sure why movie studios won't release the Theatrical version along with the unrated version. I should've waited. There is a reason these directors are reeled in and given some boundaries.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There are no words. None. This book is amazing, heart wrenching, beautiful, and whole. Yes, whole. Because that's what you feel when you're finished reading it. College Hoover is brilliant.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|It's interesting movie. Something similar to resident evil by story line. Few unexpected twists makes this movie less boring. Part of it really boring though, but it's OK. It's worth watching.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|He has created another new character. Most all around talent of our day. Looking forward to The Expendables 3, 4 and 5.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Not sure what I can here other than it arrived on time, high quality as expected and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for Lost Season 3
B00A6SZRJ0|2.0|I feel like this was a lazy effort to put a bunch of tracks together and call it an album. Two Steps From Hell is way better than this.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Not sure what I can here other than it arrived on time, high quality as expected and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for Lost Season 4
B008K3N68M|5.0|I love it, I really love it. Can't wait for season 3 to come out on DVD. So much to explore
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Not sure what I can here other than it arrived on time, high quality as expected and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for Lost Season 5
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Shai runs around being dumb, but Tom Hardy being awesome mostly makes up for it. Very bloody though, was a bit much for my wife who enjoys the UFC with me.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Not sure what I can here other than it arrived on time, high quality as expected and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for Lost Season 6
0425263916|5.0|Reflected in You is a great sequel to Bared to You. I'm eagerly waiting for the third installment to be released!
B004IYWN7C|3.0|I thought movie was a cute and funny . However it's that the greatest kid movie ever. My son watched once but didn't want to again.
1476712042|5.0|It has an interesting twist on a sweet love story. You'll be hooked! Cannot wait for the sequel's release in April 2013!
B00000633U|3.0|I only like a couple of songs in this album and bought it for those. The others are just okay..nothing special.
B00A4TKDKY|3.0|Buddy Guy is now 76 years old.  He is well past his prime.  However, the live portion of this disc still shows flashes of greatness.  The Boom Boom (John Lee Hooker)/Strange Brew(Cream) medley is entertaining, as is the short version of Jimi's Voodoo Child (Slight Return). Buddy seems to be paying tribute to some of the greats that influenced him, and those that he influenced, on tracks like those; as well as his long time friend and mentor Muddy Waters on Mannish Boy and I Just Want to Make Love to You.<br /><br />If you want a smoking live recording of Buddy in his prime, check out the \\"Real Deal\\" disc with G.E. Smith and the SNL band.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|i LOVE EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM...THIS BEAUTIFUL LADY IS AMAZING....WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ALL OF HER ALBUMS. GO ADELE!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable works great.  I have used it to transfer music and pictures from my computer to my Kindle Fire.  So glad I purchased.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|threat vector  it was okay  do not recommend to anyone.  disappointed to say the least.  mot the clancy of old
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|Please don't waste your time or money on this. I was eager to see it after viewing the trailers in theaters, but (very fortunately) did not get to it in time in theaters. But I was very disapppointed in the film. Too bad. I like many of the actors in it and the director as well. It's just awful. So glad I only wasted the money on a streaming rental.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|Love that you can choose different board colors and piece appearances.  I'm not a chess expert so I just play on the easiest level, but there is also an option to make it even easier by removing pieces of your opponenet.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Using a calculator with such a big, clear display is a refreshing change. I can't imagine going back to using a regular calculator with a small display. This app is especially valuable when working with a group, everyone can see what's happening on the calculator.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|You need a large screen to play this game.  The larger your screen, the better.  This game seems to mostly invovle noticing differences between pictures and locating hidden objects.  It has an interesting storyline and feels much like it belongs to the Harry Potter genre.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I thought their first was great, this one is at least as good, if not better.  Definitely worth a buy.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This app works great on my Samsung Galaxy S III and Samsung Note Tablet. It has great graphics with an interesting storyline suggesting history to ancient Mediterranean cultures.  It also has increasingly difficult challenges as you progress through the storyline.
8866130923|5.0|I love this planner because it has the dates on the week in the left column and notes in the right column, perfect for my work.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I really am glad I bought the movie and have all these random extra discs. However, we do not own a Bluray player. Therefore I was very sad that all the 'good' extras were on the bluray disc. I've had to go to my brothers to watch. I guess I'll finally be able to enjoy it at home when bluray players become cheaper or i just finally give in.
B0000UJL96|5.0|What a fine finish to a series.  With all of the Shakespeare quotes, elevates this to almost high art.  Loved the ice planet scenes.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This series is original, with well developed characters and great acting!  Truly scary, with moments of witty humor for levity.
B0000683DH|5.0|The finest of the TOS films. Just what I expected.  This is one of those films that never get old.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|was kind of dumb, as much as they advertised it I thought it  would be much better than what it was.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't. The premise was interesting, but that's about where it ended. Don't waste your time or money on this dud.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Well take another look. How much time do we really spend with them. A gripping story to make us all stop and listen.
0307744434|5.0|I received this book from and Indie book subscription club. I had heard murmerings about it, although not enough to go out and get it--but boy am I grateful it came across my desk anyway! What a dreamy, magical, wonderful book! Especially for a first novel (which I believe this is.)<br /><br />\\"The Night Circus\\" tells the story of Celia and Marco, two young magicians whose teachers (masters?) magically bound the two as children to each other and to a competitive \\"game\\" which ends only with the death of one of the players. \\"Le Cirque des Rêves\\" (The Circus of Dreams, or The Night Circus) is supposed to serve as merely a clever and unusual board for this magical game of chess-to-the-death; but it ends up becoming a living world of its own, permeating not only the lives of the two opponents, but the world at large, as well as the imagination of the reader of the book. I was completely taken in by \\"Le Cirque des Rêves;\\" its inception and evolution, its ambiance and performers. When the love and competition between Celia and Marco reaches its apex, and the very existence of the Night Circus and its participants is in danger I was absolutely unable to put the book down.<br /><br />This is a book that will draw you completely into its world of magic, love, drama and possibility. Don't miss out!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Patricia Cornwell is always a great read. Get this book. All of the Scarpetta book are worth the cost. So got reading.
0312427646|5.0|There is nothing not to like about Alan Bennett, and about this book in particular. I like his writing style--observant and insightful but concise. I also like the way he thinks--he relays heavy truths with wonderful humor. And finally, I just love that his stories have these random and sometimes ridiculous premises, and yet when you read them every situation is somehow familiar and recognizable. This book in particular is a gem for book lovers not only because it is filled with familiar names and titles, but because the Queen's evolution as a reader will ring absolutely true with anyone who has ever picked up a book and evolved as a reader him or herself. Bennett is a delightful author. You might start reading Bennett with \\"The Uncommon Reader\\", but you certainly won't end there!
B005EI86JU|4.0|Gives much information. It explains many of the &#34;why's&#34; that the manual leaves out. Very satisfied. I have learned enough to be worth the price of the book. Got the Kindle version.
0553386794|3.0|It's been a while since I've really delved into a good SciFi/Fantasy series, so I was happy to find this one. George Martin has been called \\"a modern day Tolkein\\", and I think that isn't so far off the mark. So far I don't *love* this series the way I loved the Lord of the Rings series, but there are plenty of similarities as far as the depth and believability of the world Martin has created. Solid story, good character development, plenty of intrigue and adventure, with just a tiny bit of magic and a hint of more to come. I was very pleased with this first book and am looking forward to continuing the series.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I was expecting this to be a bit more about technique and do's/don'ts. But that's not exactly what this book is.<br />Still, it was insanely well written, totally worth the read, and STILL very informative.<br />Well worth the price.
B00A993UWM|5.0|We hit a home run with this album every song is just filled with so much energy and she literally poured herself into the production of it.  Perfect mix of dance, pop, and rockish songs. It's just totally modern and now!!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|If you are a science fiction fan or not it is a really great movie.  If you loved the 'Alien' movies you will for sure love this.  This is a movie to watch over and over. Must watch close....  Lots going on.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|The songs already out are of course excellent, and most of the songs are upbeat and original sounding. If you like what's out there on the radio from them, you'll like the album.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I enjoy the imagination that goes into the MIB Movies. You can really let your mind run wild with all of the plots.<br />Great movie for you to enjoy with friends and/or family while smiling and following along.
B009VL28W2|5.0|Awesome performance by metallica, to the reviewer who said James hetfields vocals are \\"atrocious to say the least\\" please get your ears checked, great sound quality on the blu ray, a must have for any metallica fan.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly's, The Black Box kept my interest from the first page to the last. I love Harry Bosch, scars and all, and most of all I love his tenacity. He promises to solve the crime or find the murderer, and even 20 years later he fulfills that promise. Harry Bosch is the best detective series around. Michael Connelly is at the top of his game with another Harry Bosch Novel!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Alien Anthology for $20?  I'm down with that!  With stunning video quality and tons of extras for each movie, you cannot go wrong.  Of course, Alien: Resurrection was almost a spoof of the Alien series, but it still is lots of fun providing you do not take that movie too seriously.  The other three are great, although Alien 3 starts out as a bummer, but I don't want to spoil it for the one person who has not yet seen that film.  Just be warned that its starts out depressing.  Buy this package.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a great app. I enjoy the game and have had no problems....the graphics are great. The price is right, too.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love the angry birds franchise. But boy those damn pigs piss you off. But Ohh So fun!!! Its a must have.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I HAVE WATCHED SUITS FROM THE BEGINNING. I CANNOT WAIT FOR JANUARY TO SEE SEASON THREE.  THE ACTORS ARE PERFECT IN THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES.  I HAVE TRIED TO PURCHASE SEASON TWO. CAN YOU ADVSE WHEN IT WILL BE AVAILABLE?  THANK YOU
B009YP9L7U|3.0|An easy read after a busy day at work or at home although quite predictablewith the story line.Can easily be put down and picked up again
B0076DELIG|2.0|For some reason, I could not get into this book, the writing seemed a bit slow, not up to the earlier books i loved with Harry Bosch..
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Products works well takes a few polls to get a reliable value can not rush the meter take your time
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|This movie could have been funnier if the writers were less crude and more creative.  But with the propert herbs its worth renting but not buying.
B00A3T5CGU|2.0|This is a good app but it takes up a significant amount of storage space for the maps.  Other app work just as well with lesser storage requirements.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Loved this story of love, proving anything is possible, humor in just about everything and the beauty that the world beholds.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The actors/actresses were a good fit. Suspenseful & a lot of twists in it.  Not to mention all Batman's  cool toys.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great movie...action,intrigue, makes for a great movie night !  Watched it with my boys and they enjoyed it as well. Just add popcorn!
1451638647|5.0|&#34;You Idiot, Ivan.&#34;  this phrase is one of the leitmotifs in the amazing and wonderful Vorkosigan/Barrayar universe, and often amply justified by his regrettably slow cognitive processes.<br />Here, Ms. Bujold redeems Ivan Vorpatril and convincingly demonstrates that integrity, honor, loyalty and willingness to put his life on the line count for more than being 'quickwitted'.<br />I enjoyed it very much and feel that it is a worthy addition to one of the best series one could read.<br />I have donated 3 complete sets of Bujold's works to local libraries over the last 20 years, and find it money well spent.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Loved it.  Great read and a couple of good life lessons.  Definately learned the value of  reassessing my expectations and will think of it when I hit one of those rough spots life tosses at us.
B000FC10H0|4.0|Recommended book for anyone who owns any type of business - big or small.<br /><br />Excellent, insightful and thought provoking. Thought there are many successful examples in real world which go against the laws, still I found the book, a must read.
1400069289|5.0|This book was very interesting. It made me looks at my own cues for why I do or don't do certain things. I found it an easy read with great example stories and explanations of the science behind habits, both good and bad.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game on Facebook so when I saw they were offering a free download for my kindle I didn't waste anytime to get it..
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the first book this one just picks up where it left off.<br />The book is very descriptive in a sexual way but loved it.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I'm a Sci-Fi lover to the core so I'll forgive most anything.  I really like this movie and especially the shocker at the end.  I won't spoil it for you
B009ZE27US|2.0|ok. I'm 13, and I know they don't know me, but the age scale never dipped below 25. needs a better range.
1451613512|1.0|If you are looking for an objective look at the Cold War and beyond look elsewhere. This book is a disgrace. The authors heap praise on Henry Wallace to a degree that is laughable, especially in comparison to Harry Truman, who they make out to be more evil than Stalin.<br /><br />Vietnam is blamed on Eisenhower, Johnson and Nixon, while Kennedy is given a pass of sorts.<br /><br />To be clear, I am a progressive & almost never vote otherwise. Frankly, I am not pleased that the authors of this book describe themselves as progressives as well.<br /><br />The authors make the same mistakes that a freshman in a college International Relation paper would make, and likely not make a second time. That is, the Soviet Union was just reacting to the actions of the United Staes, Britian and France after World War II. There's a bit of truth there, but it is far more complicated.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I like this 3rd edition of Batman.  and why do they make us type so much?!  Can't we just rate the movie by Stars and a one liner?!  Geesh!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|How can anyone comment on the classic books of Sherlock Holmes. Great reading and all of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books in one place.
B003SI05PG|5.0|again, why do we have to type so much to rate the movie?!!  A one liner should suffice!  GEESH!  AND still had to add one more work, CMOOOON!!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love shopping on Ebay (and AMAZON).  This is one app I really will use.  PayPal makes it even easier.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Good game but expect slow play when playing for free.  Many game features encourage spending and that gets frustrating.  Also wants you to share Facebook friends.
1452110581|5.0|Intriguing title, delightful poems &#34;written&#34; by cats. Recommend for any cat lover even dog lovers would enjoy this book. Great reading.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Good that I can store my music online and listen where I want without downloading again. Easy to set up and use Amazons player.
B008469DGY|5.0|Great game to play especially when having to wait on someone or something. Easy download and it is free from app store.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great movie, good plot, worth watching for sure and I can't tell you whether to rent or buy since I generally only watch movies once or twice and renting is good enough for me. I do believe anyone that likes the Bourne series of films will enjoy this. Thanks for reading my review.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|funny but not as funny as it is... distastefull I guess.The laughs that do come don't happen as much as do the the groans
B009LY72LQ|5.0|Exactly as described. Good service and shipping conditions<br />Great to boost creativity and to combine with my niece's existing Monster High items and dolls. She's going to love it.<br />Furthermore it's a pretty exclusive toy in my country. I haven't seen anything similar, not even advertised anywhere.<br />Very satisfied altogether
B005NJU8PA|4.0|The 4HC has a little of everything from his past books, plus Tim brings some new ideas to the table. Some of the recipes are not that practical, but the book does open the mind to the possibilities and stays true to the \\"MED\\" philosophy of the least amount of effort for the largest overall results. Like all of the 4-Hour books, part of the poetry of the 4HC is that it operates on different levels. You can skip around, reread some sections and place different amounts of energy into understanding the lessons. No matter what approach you take, each attempt at reading will impart a different meaning. In short, the 4HC is a great read and even a better gift idea.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|This is a very nice microphone for the money and for general voice over work.<br />I would not use this mic for professional singing, just spoken word.<br /><br />I have many microphones, and this compares to the $50. range mics.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch novel never fails to hold my interest! Good story and good writing.  I think I have read all of the Bosch novels and always enjoy
B005FFW46S|5.0|For the disc world fan, and particulary the Commander Vimes fan, this is a view of a far more intellectual 'copper' in action.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|Nice add-on for my Nikon D7000, but limited to small areas that need extra flash.  For large areas and distance you need to go bigger.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Since Red October was published by Naval Institute Press ,I've been a great fan!<br />Not a disappointment! Dives deep into the omnipresent threat of cyber warfare with a great yarn!<br />BZ , Tom Clancy and Company
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show keeps delivering. It's got great writing, great cast, great pacing, great special effects. The complexity and growth of the characters is the main reason I watch the show. I also like the fact they strayed away from the graphic novel. The show has become its own telling of man v man.
B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|Seriously like one long commercial, just when I thought it might get interesting it ends. Amazon should not even listed this movie as a movie, let alone charge for it!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I saw this movie at the theatre when it first came out and my husband and I took cousins who had not<br />been to a movie in a long time..they all loved it as much as I did..  We wish there could be a sequel to<br />it..has such a great story to tell..<br /><br />I only buy movies I want to see over again..and this one is one of the top movies in my collection..
B001P3SA94|4.0|I thought this movie would have more Beyonce since she's all over the trailer and the cover...but I'm just warning y'all she's only in it for about 10-15 minutes of the movie. But I will say the film was great, it told the wonderful story about how music was changed forever by a few men who wanted to make music better. It's a great film with great acting, it's not a film for children though.
B005LAIIQC|1.0|Why did they have to continue this series? THe first few were ok but it's getting really old that hollywood can't make a movie where spies actually fight people other than americans! zzzzzzzzzzz.  Really? with evil terrorists and out of control communist and rogue states out there all we can get is bad americans?  Fighting the cia? Actually there may  have been no real cia on cia battles ever in history. Or days of the condor. Or whatever. BUt hollywood can't get away from this type of thing. There is a new movie based on real cia people called 'zero dark thirty' coming out at the theaters soon. NOone in the cia tries to kill each other though. how wierd is that? Please avoid this movie so that they will stop making movies where a betrayed agent fights the cia. It's really old and a waste of time. Although the first 2 borne movies were great. But I love movies so I watched this on blu ray and it looked good, the story is bad though.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I didn't really know much about Lana Del Rey, but this album was on sale for $2.99 so I just bought it. It was so worth it, I love her blunt songs and beautiful orchestrations. This album is worth so much more that $2.99, do yourself a favor and by it.
B00633W614|4.0|I like on going sagas.<br />I will tell my friends about this series.<br />I choose it because of the first book. Only Time will Tell.
B008KW43TE|5.0|I don't care who you are or what your normal taste in music is, this album is for you. I have to say at first I was not a fan but as I continued to listen to the album it grew on me. After a few re-listens it has quickly become, in my opinion, the best album of 2012. I love it, Ocean is creative and innovative and fresh and new. In the current music scene few artists can be so daring, and be so successful. I am absolutely amazed by this album and it is defiantly in my favorite albums of all time.
B000JMKNVK|5.0|I like the chemistry between these two characters, Kenzie and Gennaro. I  would love to see a movie using these characters, whether it is Prayers for Rain or any of the other books they are in.
B0037BB00I|5.0|Adele is a singer who sings well. She has made a very good album. Therefore, this album is nice. Cheers.
0547884591|5.0|Extremely helpful book. It will take some discipline to actually apply it but like the Four Hour Workweek and Four Hour Body it will be extremely efficient and high yield.
B005HSL626|5.0|Any game that makes me rub a hole on my phone must be awesome because I just don't do that kind of stuff. Great for the doctor's office, WalMart checkout, late night gaming sessions, you name it.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|I downloaded this album before I exited the theater. I have been listening to it while I work. (I am a artist). Brilliant.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Say what you will about the series - its one of my favorites. ANd the extras on the bonus dvds are great. Great quality, nice packaging, and comes with a little art booklet. Also comes with the digital copy. Good stuff. I'm not gonna review the movies themselves - everyone and their mom has seen them, and if you haven't, go do it. Now. I mean it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great show. Started off a little slow then really started to pick up during episodes 7-9. I really wish they would add the new episodes to Amazon Instant sooner. The wait times fluctuate.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Snow White has come along way since I was a kid. I enjoyed the movie, it was just very different.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Five stars are not enough for this book. I have read over 80 books this year, and this is one of the best.  Thank you Colleen Hoover.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Great movie, entertaining and funny. The horse was awesome and funny his actions were so much fun to watch. Just great.
B007SGM084|1.0|I found the book to be repetitive (pun intended), unimaginative, not very well written. I put it down after several chapters and will try again, but it definitely didn't grab me.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Downloaded the MP3 version for convenience and the tunes are great.  Don't usually go for &#34;live&#34; recorded music, but these were done masterfully.  If you're a fan in any way I would recommend Celebration Day.
B000YHG72E|5.0|One of our favorite Christmas movies! It was the lowest price on this blue ray dvd that we have seen this holiday season.
B0064BWE8U|3.0|This was a great wishy washy mindless read, which is sometimes just what you need. Great for an escapist moment.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|The kids were real, the dialogue was crisp, and it was not a rip-off, sequel, or CGI-fest. I've bought copies for 6 family members and a friend!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|very much like this app indeed. thank you alarm clock xtreme free. you wake me up every day to my fav music xoxox
B004OC07N0|5.0|This book is provided to all new top-level managers at a large academic medical center to which I'm connected. Great book!
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Everyone in my book club loved this book.  It was tender and somewhat enjoyable.  But it did not grab me.  Much too much info about car racing of  which I have  nooooo interest.  Can't say it was a waste of time. But I read a lot of better book this year.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I really enjoyed the first three-fourths of the book.  It was suspenseful; a real page turner.....and then it took a sudden turn that I wasn't prepared for nor did I like....it became too far fetched.  After that, it was downhill for me.  Maybe this should have been classified as sci-fi rather than mystery.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|I like this case, but the angle I get when I use the stand isn't the best, and I wish it had something to hold my stylus.
1451627297|5.0|I have always been a fan of Stephen King's horror books and was a little hesitant when I found out this was a book on time travel. A part of me was afraid I would be disappointed, but after giving it a go, this might be my favorite King book thus far.<br /><br />Simply put, Stephen King is the best story teller out there. How he manages to navigate a complex web of individual storylines and connect them together so effortlessly for the reader is beyond me. Every city from Derry to Dallas had a new adventure and I was captivated. I almost felt part of the story as King had me engrossed at every turn.<br /><br />His story telling was emaculate, his characters well-developed, and the suspense continued page after page. This will be a cult classic for King fans for years to come.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This is a great classic feel good family movie.  A must see for all. The HD playback on the Roku is amazing.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|I have a Roku and use it with Amazon to watch many TV shows and movies. I purchased this episode after missing in on TV. My only complaint is that Amazon doesn't have a &#34;rent&#34; option TV shows, so you have to buy each episode for typically $1.99. It would be nice to be able to rent at a lower price because with TV you aren;t as likely to watch it again as you are with a movie.
B00ADIT8U2|1.0|I have downloaded many games and this by far is the worst. I was amazed at the high reviews it received so I gave it a try. It has no storyline and the graphics are poor. Sorry I wasted my time and money on this awful game.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This dvd was well worth buying. Three different versions, although if you love this movie as much as I do you will always want to watch the director's extended cut with 16 extra minutes of film. And the bonus material on the making of avatar and the deteled scenes that didn't make it into the extended version is very interesting.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Just listen to the song Gorilla....enough said. Doubt we'll here my favorite song on the radio without some editing though lol
B005K17RU0|4.0|I chose this app because I am always interested in what the weather is dong outside and of course its always nice to know the temp so I can dress appropriately. I would have given this app a 5 star rating if it didn't require wifi to work. Thats the only drawback I see.
B000T433CO|5.0|This is just a too, cute movie.  Not a big Jack Black fan, but liked him in this one.<br />A chick flick.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am a spider solitaire addict! I play in no less than 4 suits and I have a win rate of 95%, but I'm bragging lol. I was so very happy to find this app for my tablet so that I can play spider when ever and where ever I want, at least while my tablets batter lasts :D Awsome app, thanks for making it!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Didn't think this would be such a great movie!  Have seen is 3x now and I am 41 years young! Worth seeing for sure!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A gentle, and well-thought out story of two very different people, who find ways of adapting to changing circumstances, and find friendship and eventually love in unexpected places. Really well written and thoughtful. Loved this book.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|It was cute. I am not sure I would have been thrilled to see it in the theatres.  But am happy we saw it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'm a grandmother who was interested in learning the game the grandkids love!  And it really is fun!  Look forward to using all the great options on my new KindleFire.
B004F1F32A|5.0|Great movie, suspense, action and life lesson.  Watched it w/ my 13 year old daughter, had a good conversation afterwards about Sex trafficking and how it is happening here in the US just as much.  Great movie!!
B005NJU8PA|3.0|I ordered the eBook (viewing on iPad) thinking that it be similar in layout and general experience to the printed book but they're very far apart.  The eBook has odd spacing and seems to be missing images.<br /><br />Having seen the physical book at the store I wish I would have gotten that instead as the eBook is a total disappointment.<br /><br />And, since Amazon is the publisher (unless I'm mistaken), I would have liked to have seen them take a bit more pride in their eBook translation and help expand the boundaries of publishing.
098478280X|5.0|Cracking the Coding Interview is an excellent book if you are looking to brush up on your CS knowledge. Don't look hear if you are expecting to ace and interview and don't know much about CS. It is a good refresher, in that it goes over various concepts and topics that you may have covered in classes several years back and don't necessarily remember all the details. There were a couple &#34;Oh yea I remember that&#34; moments.<br /><br />The practice problems that Gayle has put at the end of over chapter are highly recommended. I have gone through several software development interviews and can tell you for a fact that the practice problems that Gayle presents you with are either directly asked of you during an interview, or some derivative of them is asked. Actually working out the coding problems is a good way to get prepared for the interview.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book to get yourself prepared for a software development interview.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Cute story, lighthearted but not as predictable story line, which is refreshing. Look forward to others like it from this author
B0085YNML2|4.0|This game is very fun and addictive.  My daughter and I like to play and see how we can maneuver the little Gecko.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|If you enjoy reading personal accounts of wars recent or in the past reading a book on Navy SEALs is always a good place to start. I got more than I bargained for with this one. Instead of just talking about the training and the deployments the author takes this book to the next level revealing a gripping personal story, one that is above and beyond anything I have ever read before. I have read almost a dozen SEAL books and others and while this may not provide all the technical aspects of war that some history and tech junkies may be craving it is a deeply moving story. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading, I think it can appeal to any taste, probably not for the kids though :)
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Yes, I loved this.  I like a spy thriller with some family drama.  Lack of family drama was why I didn't like 24 towards the end.  it was all about blowing stuff up and shootouts. I wanted to see Keifer Sutherland going home to his wife and doing homework with his kids and dealing with family situations when he wasn't at work.  HOMELAND accomplishes this.  During work hours it's all work and no play but when the characters go home at night you get relief from all the spy stimuli and enjoy great acting by the supporting cast playing Brody's wife and two kids and a glimpse into Carrie's family life. Dysfunctional as it is.
B000803PKY|5.0|I've always loved &#34;Running on Empty&#34; and as it's an old classic I won't bother reviewing the music itself. This DVD-A version is just great...captures the nuances and depth of the performances in a way that is much closer to the original vinyl on which I first listened to this album.<br />If you can find it I highly recommend it.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Cool to see Mark Wahlberg in something other than an action film. This movie has some really funny parts that include the teddy bear.
B008XG1X18|5.0|There are so many ideas on this website for home and work and school. It is just unbelievable. I actually lose time when I visit Pinterest.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I didnt buy this set from here, I got it from the Amazon UK site. It was alot cheaper, and took only a few days more to get it. Plus, it has 11 CDs not the 8 this US version has. Looks like the same case as well. I have tested a few of the DVDs soo far and they looks great. Ofcourse, the first couple of movies weren't filmed in the higher end HD film, so the quality isnt as good as new HD produced movies. Still they are good.<br /><br />The box is more like a standard plastic case, not the special addition box that cost considerably more. If you want a full set of this series without breaking the bank, I would certainly get it, you wont be dissapointed. Go to Amazon UK and get the extra DVDs and save more money.
B0095R6OBS|1.0|This is not the new Frankenweenie movie. We purchased it thinking it was...Make sure you read description. Disturbing animated film about a dead dog a boy brings back to life.
B009LRE040|5.0|I loved this movie and can't find anything worth complaining about.  I get that people are disappointed with the ending nolan delivered to the viewing public.  But, before you get all bent out of shape, just try and sit through earlier attempts at the batman franchise and I dare you not to hit the stop button (mr freeze anyone?).  The three latest batman movies are easily the best three batman movies and may be some of the best comic book movies of all time.  Is the dark night better than the dark night rises?  Yeah okay I can get behind that on some levels, but that's like asking what's better a doughnut with glaze or a doughnut without.  Who cares they are both delicious doughnuts and you should be happy to have any doughnut.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I usually don't like anime, but this movie was great. It's basically the story of the little mermaid which I loved as a child so it's not wonder I like this movie too.
0525952926|3.0|I agree with a lot of the negative reviews of this book: it's not one of Follett's strongest.  Yes, it's a page turner, and some of the character development is excellent. I read it very quickly and did enjoy it.  But compared to Follett's Pillar's of the Earth and its sequel, this seems pretty weak. I cannot quite put my finger on it, but I think it's because those earlier works were set in a much less well-known epoch, so it all seemed so fresh and new.  The characters in Winter in the World, however, seem to find themselves right in the very middle of every major world event between 1933 and 1948.  A character is driving around Hawaii, and you just know his car is going to get shot up by a Japanese Zero.  It got kind of annoying.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this one!  It has an unusual storyline and great graphics!  The monkey was a different twist!  I'm not a big fan of HO games but this one had more puzzles than most.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|It was exactly as described and I think that my daughter is going to love it. I also like the lenticular cover!
B009O5CLZY|5.0|No matter what your age you will really get into this game because it offers such a great variety of action.  The new Christmas addition is just as exciting.  I look forward to playing it with the kids (and by myself when they aren't looking).  I will watch for future games from this company because they are very good at what they do!
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|It was exactly as described and it was a great product. My daughter loves 1D so this will go perfectly with her new 1D CD player! Fast shipping. Excellent value!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I absolutely love my Verso Prologue Case for my Kindle Fire. I was a little skeptical buying online without seeing it first but it is exactly as shown.  It fits my Kindle Fire perfectly. No gaps or issues closing it either. It is the perfect size, just like reading a normal book. I have received many compliments on it too.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Amateur night for Grisham.  Nothing made sense, and he acts as if the FBI has the wherewithal of the Keystone cops.  I'd tell you to wait for the movie, but who would possibly option this thing?
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I bought the series and have watched it over and over!! I love the people and the stories.<br />The tone of the stories were very informative.
6305161992|4.0|This is a good one,if you like action.Also shows you what a star Brandon Lee might have made if he had lived.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I own a lot of knives and several Esee knives. This could replace my Esee 5 in a pinch and it is half the price. Needs sharpened before use.
B005B0QYMM|3.0|This was an okay movie. It is very slow, and at 1 point I almost turned it off, but I kept an open mind and sat through it. I think maybe the last 45 minutes or so were a good watch, but that's it.
B0000AMJED|5.0|What can I say about this DVD 2 Fast 2 Furious love the movie and have bought all the others DVDs of The Fast and Furious, I really enjoy watching these movies and will watch them over and over. Sincerely Janice
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|movie was a bit longer than initially anticipated but nevertheless a good movie.  can't wait to watch all 3 back to back to back!  come on robin, boy wonder, what can you bring to the crime-fighting table?
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|The movie Shooter will blow you away, I really enjoyed this movie, and found it well written and the actor (Mark Wahlberg) was really, really good in the movie.Its a movie that makes you stop and think, can this really happen. Sincerely Janice
B002RI9HUM|4.0|Rachel Holiday , was far better story line , and characters than a lot of the other chick type lit I have been reading.<br />Had a very deep message when it was all boiled down, but a good up beat ending.<br />so will read more of this author too.
1583334386|5.0|Fantastic book and one of the best I have ever read on Willpower. I have already read this twice and I believe it is almost like therapy. The book is gender neutral and very witty and would appeal to all. To give you some idea of where I am coming from I also like the books of Dan Ariely, Richard Restak, John Medina, Charles Duhigg, Richard Wiseman.<br /><br />The book is a very easy read and the end of chapter summaries are also useful for that quick fix in case you want to get a boost. Well done and looking forward to other books from Kelly.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This is the 3rd time i have purchased and read this book.  Just the 1st section on Frankl's experience in the death camps is full of inspiration.  It is somewhat disturbing to be faced with the inhumanity we all have potential to act out.  But the lessons Frankl learned and that we can learn from today are worth the book at twice the price.  The 2nd half of the book is less exciting but eminently profound.  Reading about Frankl's method of therapy is very instructive for anyone's life.  This is a life changing book if the contents are thought about deeply.
B003K15IF8|4.0|This was an interesting read. Stoner's cold marriage is so real. It was really a great book. Sorry, I can't remember more deatils to give a better review, but I remember finishing and thinking wow that was good :)
B000YHG72E|5.0|It's a classic, suitable for all ages compared to most stuff pedaled for Christmas . Bob Newhart is a hoot.
1476712042|3.0|I am somewhere in the middle on this one.  I moved through it fairly swiftly and was usually eager to hear what would happen next which is a big positive point when I am judging how I feel about a book.  It was very romantic and my younger self could relate to some of the college-age relationship story.  However, as a now 40-something mom, who met her husband when she was nearly 30 (gasp!) I found all of the characters way too needy about being in relationships....especially destructive, controlling ones!  If Travis and \\"Pidge\\" spend some significant time apart, and then re-unite somewhere down the road...I would have some faith that they were meant to be.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I chose this book because of a recommendation from a friend whose judgment I know doubt. I never finished the book. It was turgid, uninteresting with murky, boring characters.
B0063IH60K|3.0|it is a fun app. I use it alot while waiting for anything I need to burn time for. Good app.
B0026NBZDU|4.0|Ms. Waters does a masterful job depicting this era and her characters are vividly drawn. I couldn't put it down!
B00005221M|4.0|Grand views, beautiful scenery, good acting..... this is a good movie.  The good guy thing is a little over played... running through the woods taking hip shots with a musket (the most inaccurate weapon in history) and hitting guys dead center is a little over played.... but for the most part, this is very well done.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Sky is a girl who has been homeschooled by her Luddite (adopted) mother for her whole life; she begs to go to school for her senior year. Her mother reluctantly agrees, and thus Sky enters the world of mostly obnoxious teenagers. Unfortunately she has a bit of an undeserved reputation, but she doesn't really care about that. She meets Dean Holder, another recipient of an undeserved reputation, who is sexy, funny, mysterious and sometimes incredibly angry. She's intrigued (and attracted) but she doesn't understand why he runs so hot and cold with her. He does, though, and it's a secret that he keeps from her until she discovers the truth...<br /><br />And I'm not going to tell you what it is because that would SPOIL IT.<br /><br />I actually had to think on this one for about 48 hours before I could review it. I had to think about what I loved (most of it), hated (the subject matter) and felt indifferent to (which I can't address without spoiling it).<br /><br />The biggest problem was more with ME than with the book: I inhaled this book, and because of the TRICKY subject matter, it's meant to be enjoyed more slowly and thoroughly. I need to go back and re-read so that I can give it proper credit.<br /><br />My main criticism is the sub-characters (if that's a word). Holder, Sky and her mom were well-fleshed out. Sky's best friend, her new school friend, and Sky's mom's boyfriend were much less so. Other relatives, practically nothing. Those outlying characters were more what they DO/DID/ACTED than who they were. I think the author attacked the subject matter so carefully, and she did such a marvelous job making it believable and real and heartfelt, that some of those lesser characters took a backseat to that. So it felt okay, overall, but I can't help comparing it to [[ASIN:B009R44MQ8 The Sea of Tranquility]], which managed to cover a lot of secrets and trauma and characters (and was a lot longer) with a bit more depth. This book was more straightforward. Sky was easier to relate to. She was intelligent and funny and... teenager-ish. She was very real.<br /><br />Highly recommend.<br /><br />Plus, the author, Colleen Hoover, is just wonderful and loves her fans and interacts with them regularly on Facebook and Twitter.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|It's classic Hitchcock at it's best.  It's The Birds!  When it comes to classic horror films... few compare.  And this copy looks great!  They did an amazing job on remastering the picture.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love the twist on the old storyline and the modern themes in this show. I'll keep watching it just as long as it's in production, for sure.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|Ultra bright!  Ultra colorful!  Ultra cheesy!  Ultra Flash!!  LOVED this movie when I was young and was glad to add it to my movie collection.  Don't expect the greatest special effects and costumes.  The acting is pretty bad too.... but come on... it's Flash Gordon!!  I wouldn't have it any other way.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I can't believe how much I enjoyed the 2nd installment in this series! Ready to download the final book.  Haven't enjoyed a series like this.......ever!  Look forward to the next adventure of the Wasp. GREAT BOOKS.!!!!!!!!!
B000002H5I|5.0|I have always been a fan of this album.  I can't say I found the rest of her albums as good as this one.  But I pretty much like every song on this cd.  I have learned to play &#34;Fast car&#34; and &#34;Baby can I hold you&#34; on guitar.  If you are a Tracy Chapman fan you probably already have this cd.  If you aren't but want to check her out... i say start with this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an amazing book! You will be thinking about it for days after reading it. Beautiful story that captures your soul, and proves that fate is very much alive and well!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Seemingly slow to start but then in a flash the story takes off and the book is impossible to put down.  Real insight into the mind of a possessive partner and the fine line between love and hate.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|just ok ... some funny parts ... but dragged on for too long.  Better for a skit, bit not enough material for a long movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Choose it because I like it. It's great. Recommend it to everyone who wan th s to have great sex
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I am a lover of old movies but this one intrigued me since Dame Judi Dench was the main character. I do not go to movies per se but when I see trailers of ones that are interesting to me, I wait for them to come out on DVD. I have watched this over and over again. Everyone is so good in it.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Fast moving and interesting plot!  It took a while to get used to Jeremy Renner, but as time went on, he fit the role.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Being a retired \\"Circuit Board Designers\\" this is a dream game!!!<br />Love it', can't put it down!  Love the \\"water\\" sound effects!!
0765316994|4.0|This book starts off strong and is amusing in the way it presents the premise. Unfortunately, it gets a little slow and trudge-y as the story draws to a conclusion. The narrative doesn't slow to a crawl, but I had more fun reading the set-up of the story than the finish.
B004UQPM4E|1.0|I should have listened to the reviewers who said they got the UK version. Because that is what I got.  It was not what I ordered or was expecting.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This is typical Clancy.  Lots going on, lots of intrigue and action.  It does not compare to his earlier works, but it is still a good read.  After a long hiatus it is great to have regular Clancy's coming again.
0761171703|5.0|I gave this as a gift and she loved it.  It is a fun book.  She loves to dance. thanks
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Wow.  I thought the first season was over the top, but this second season goes beyond the first.  The psycho-sexual horror, along with grisly murders, and this season's addition of ET's really places this series way beyond the ordinary repetitive horror stories that Hollywood keeps churning out.  At first I was leary of the addition of ET's and how they would be made to fit into the maddness that is Asylum but, it does, oh it does so well.  Jessica Lange as Sr. Jude brings new meaning to the words acting excellence.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and she delivers again in this series.  Wow.  Thank you, Ms. Lange.<br />This is definately not for little kids but for young adults and adults who love excellent cerebral horror, this is for you.<br />Enjoy!
B009B8YZIK|3.0|Pretty good expected to see more of the actual Spartans. Still worth checking out if you truly are a Halo fan.
B0076DELIG|4.0|If you like Connelly's Harry Bosch novels you'll like this one.  No new ground, but it's solid and I enjoyed it.
0307887448|5.0|PROS:<br />Nice mix of action/thrill/love interest/geekiness.<br /><br />The character has a nice arc and actually changes and grows throughout the course of the novel.<br /><br />I am not really a video game player and I was born in '89, but even I enjoyed this novel and it's plethora of references.<br /><br />I think I read the last half in one sitting.<br /><br />CONS:<br />100 pages in it started to sag a little and I was worried it was going to start getting lame, but if picked up quickly again.<br /><br />The love story line was a taaaad lame, but I think someone slightly younger (high school age) could relate to it more. Personally I like my romances more smutty, but that's just me.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I like  the name,so I purchased it- and I liked I  in the few hours  it took to read it.<br /><br />It was  imaginative were and quirky, an  offered visual cues an  possible a peek into Google.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Slow start, but great ending. I would go back and read the series again. Can't wait until the next book comes out.
B002W2U3H4|5.0|I didn't really know what this movie was about going into it other than a boy takes a trip to the North Pole to see Santa.  I had forgotten that it originally had been released in 3D so it is chock-a-block with &#34;projections&#34; of elements in scenes as well as many high-speed action sequences on the train during its journey.  The visuals will make your heart race as the train makes its way over snowy mountains, across icy lakes and finally through the city at the North Pole.  A great viewing experience!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Why can't I give this more than 5 stars?!?!  Wow, crying as I write this - what a beautifully sad story.  Colleen Hoover - so brilliant.  My heart broke about a million times.  I thought I knew what was coming but I couldn't really fully know - don't think that you can predict what will happen because you can't.  Everything came together in the most amazing way... I am just speechless right now.  Read it - right now!  AMAZING!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am ready for this to go again. I love the costumes, but more the language.  It's not often you can enjoy the dialogue in an adult tv show.<br />This behind the scenes was a great addition.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Hilariously funny and Johnny Depp has wonderful comedic timing. The rest of the cast shines in this updated version of the original.
B000023VR6|4.0|Midst the surge of pressure from the media regarding his status as a contemporary artist, even after his upward success in signing Eminem and producing the ever-lasting Slim Shady LP early in 1999, Dr. Dre recruited a handful of collaborators and recorded and released 2001 (in 1999 mind you), which would surpass the popularity of his already legendary 1992 album The Chronic.<br /><br />With its unbelievably refined production, perforating the sonic landscape of rap standards with strings, live samples and top notch modern drum programming, with a notoriously passionate Dr. Dre at the front of the mic and an equally important plethora of top billing guests (including Snoop, Xzibit, Eminem and Mary J. Blige) 2001 extended the shelf life of Gangsta Rap (and Dre's trademark G-funk) well over a couple of years after its release; surprising, considering how rap musical trends had changed so quickly since the passing of Tupac & Biggie.<br /><br />The album plays out from start to finish as a continuous audio event (a \\"sound movie\\" as Dre stated in interviews) but it does tend to vary in quality midst its own ambition and unrefined concepts and lyrical delivery. Nonetheless it managed to sway detractors away from Dr. Dre, accomplishing its original purpose.
B007SGM084|5.0|I just keep reading this whole series over and over again.  It is a great love story, very hot and sexy.  Best books I ever read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent production and acting development thru-out the entire series.  A joy to watch and each episode leads you back to the next.  Characters come alive in this story line.  Highly recommend.
B008NB0SQO|1.0|True fans of the movie who want the widescreen complete version, should seek out the Laser Disc. It's the only LD we watch, but we still bust it out every Christmas because it's a film worth watching in its entirety. I'm very disappointed they did not think to include the (beautiful, meaningful) missing song on the Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Saying a sweet song about love lost is \\"too sad\\" for a film based on a *Dickens* novel, demonstrates a real lack of understanding of the source material. It also nullifies the refrain at the end of the film (\\"The Love We've Found\\").<br /><br />Come ON, people. If parents don't want their kids hearing \\"When Love is Gone,\\" I'm sure they will have the wherewithal to hit the \\"Skip\\" button, or stick to a lesser Christmas film for their precious little slowflakes.<br /><br />Please, someone release a widescreen high-resolution COMPLETE copy of this film in Blu-Ray.
B00AE2I4B6|3.0|I enjoyed the dancing but it was a bit tedious.  still really glad I saw it.  I'm glad I did a rental.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|As of right now, Amazon hasn't showed us if it will have a 2-disc DVD Special Edition to pre-order. It comes out in a month and I don't have a blu-ray player. I'm not getting one just for this movie either. Forget it. I loved the adaptation of Part 1. Huge fan. So I'm pretty sure Part 2 will be even better but I really want a 2-disc special edition for DVD with the same special features that the 2-disc blu-ray has. Just like Part 1.
B005F3XV62|4.0|I have to admit this one sat around for a bit before I actually watched it.  I am a fan of Kevin James but didn't have the highest of hopes for a movie that features a lot of talking animals.  With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.  Kevin James plays a Zookeeper who has a thing for a woman that turns down his marriage proposal because, well, he is a zookeeper and that just isn't a real / serious profession.<br /><br />The movie is part romantic comedy but even more integral to the film here is the interaction between all of the zoo animals, who all love James, and plot to help him find happiness.  I thought the computer generated animals were brilliant and that helped make this movie a whole lot of fun.  At one point James takes one of the primates out to TGI Fridays telling the waitress \\"we just came from a costume party.\\"<br /><br />The bottom line is this is definitely a movie Kevin James fans will enjoy.  Children will also love it as the animals really do bring the magic to this movie.  The storyline and language are all very kid friendly as well.  Overall a fun movie.
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|I liked the movie, thought it was well done and would likely watch it again. However, I would not watch it on Amazon Prime. The streaming was really bad. There have been some that were really good, but this particular viewing was horrible.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Product was as described.  No complaints here!  The product arrived promptly and has fulfilled the life i had planned for it.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I expected to be disappointed in this movie, so I watched it with reservations. I was pleasantly surprised in the film.
B000I0QL82|5.0|What a pleasure to see this old favorite. Quick ship and very well packaged. Will use again for my movie selections..A++++
B007THA4FI|4.0|This was a pleasant surprise. Not having read Potter, I tried not to have any preconceptions. Even without the baggage, I had expectations however vague. I found myself thinking over and over.\\"this isn't what I expected\\" even though I wasn't quite sure what that was.<br /><br />I highly recommend.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|I love all the actors so I enjoyed the film but it did drag quite a bit, though best at the end. I enjoyed it but it was not great.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very Cute.. Would read it again. I'm a romantic book fanantic. Loved how it ended. Would recommend to a friend
0345803485|5.0|i like the book alot it was very interesting, although i would not  do things this  man expect a women to do.  only because i know my roll as a women as well as my limits and i have not had any problems so far. i would recommend this book mostly to women as early as 18yrs old because i think they have the wrong concept about themselves as far as self  respect and what they should and should not do with men.
0783240287|4.0|Cheesy but fun.  Showed it to my students before they auditioned for our school version.  It's a little inappropriate for elementary and a little cheesy for upper or high schoolers, so we had to preface that we'll be doing it differently.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Haha! I absolutely LOVE this game... It's fun, easy, funny, entertaining, and educational... Definitely worth the price. Great job creating this! :D
B002VECM6S|5.0|I watched this on cable the first time...and had to buy it...this is a wonderful story with great acting and superb ending!! Sanra Bullock does it again,....warning...this is a tear jerker!!!
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|I'm not a Riri fan but I def would say this album is one of my top fave's. Versatile, funky and fun.
B00A757EFW|2.0|This game was designed for a phone.  The controls are made for a much smaller device than the kindle fire, and they thought somehow blowing it up with exact proportions would not be awkward.  It is.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|I cancelled the purchase since it would not play on my Roku device.  I am looking into the problem and hope I am not charged for this item.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a good book with good characters and plotting, but being from Missouri, I like the setting the best. It reminds me of another Missouri author, Richard Houston and his book, A View to Die For.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone living in or close to the Ozarks.
B0017DJ3UW|5.0|Do I really have to give a review? ;) nothing like a lil Mariah during the holidays. Happy Holidays everyone & a happy new year!
030758836X|5.0|this is not the type of book i usually read. however, a friend read it and said it was really great. so i did. in two days. it flip flops from two perspectives, which keeps things really exciting. i am glad i read it, and you should too. the ending wasn't what i had anticipated, but the book was well worth the read. i can't wait to read more from her.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I greatly encourage you to read this book dir to the fact that it will saddened you that the end has arrived
B009VB97EY|1.0|I read the reviews and knew there wasn't going to be much to this movie, but a lot of reviews indicated it was a  'fun time' and 'eye candy' was good.  Even going in with low expectations this move was a let down.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|One of his best. Good plot and old friends return. I was Jack Sr. was our curren president.  Hope this series continues in the future,
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I ;lved the knowledge behind it and the ability to think outside the box of conventional science. Dr. Alexander was very careful in the documentation of his experience to keep the information as pure as possible.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always a very good book with a great story line keeping with the works of Vince Flynn looking forward to more stories of Mitch
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I did enjoy it, the plot was compelling and interesting. I wonder where the auther got his ideas for the plot, charachters, etc?
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|This movie was a hit when it first came out, and its still fun to watch now. Jack Nicholson IS the Joker of his time. Its not till the amazing Heather Leder stole the spotlight that we get a new Joker in our modern era. BUY IT if you want some cooky fun.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing.  It had very likable characters and a surprising ending.  Recommended for mostly teenagers or young adults.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I bought this book for my 10-year old son.  He enjoyed it enough that I picked it up.  I thought it was a very touching, but also well plotted, story.  It doesn't feel like it is simply teaching a lesson, but it teaches a powerful one about empathy.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My kids loved the game.  It doesn't get tiring and they love helping the animals with their problems.  It is worth it
B0012NVGHU|3.0|I thought the movie was very sweet, but is was slow moving.  It was such a &#34;slice of life&#34; that I didn't feel like I get the chance to know a whole lot about the characters.  The music was truly beautiful.  All in all, I enjoyed it but wouldn't call it can't miss.
0446580848|1.0|At least I checked it out from the Library.  It was large print, the only version they had, and it was/is 927 pages long.  But I will enjoy this, I thought, because I had enjoyed other DeMille books.  Not to be.  Almost from the first, the wise cracks from Mr. Corey started appearing, and seemed to grow more frequent as the book went on.  I can't finish this, I kept thinking, hundreds of pages into the book, but curiosity kept me going to the end.  And the sophomorish wise cracks continued.  Three times someone said to Corey, \\"The Koran,\\" and three times Corey replied, \\"Which Korean?\\"  It strains the mind to wonder how a smart wife like Kate could possibly put up with this.  And the plot?  There was a bit of a plot there, but there was certainly no editor to ask DeMille to shorten some of his needlessly repetitive narrations.  We all knew, we readers, that the villain would die, and John would survive, but toward the end of the book some of us could not help but hope that this time the villain would win out, and it would be the end of John Corey, once loved by many.
B001EBV0NA|4.0|This will always be one of my all times favs!! It's scary, but I laugh at certain parts lol .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book has blown my mind. Colleen Hoover has completely out done herself with Hopeless. This one has it all and more. Each character was so brilliantly written that you can't help but get so involved into the story. The way they all interact with each other felt real and raw. The love that Sky and Holder have for one another is just so beautiful you really can't help but feel every emotion they feel. I laughed, I cried, I laughed and cried some more. I felt their happiness, their playfulness and even their sorrow. I love how each page keeps you wanting more. This book flowed flawlessly.  Collen Hoover really poured so much out on each page that I was never once disappointed. Hopeless is definitely on my top 5. If I could give this more stars I would. Absolutely Brilliant! A must read!.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I really enjoy Follett's writings and this is no exception.  He does a great job of creating compelling characters in the middle of the most significant historical events that shaped the 20th century.  It really humanizes history in a way that you cannot get from the textbooks.  But there is so much material, it seems that he sometimes struggles to tie in the relevant historical events to the personal stories he is creating in these novels.  He did a masterful job of this in The Pillars of the Earth, but this does not have the same balance.  In any case, I look forward to the next book, and foresee some sleepless nights reading it as well.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I have a book in print and two underway.  I admire Vince Flynn immensely, and wish I could write as well as he does.  Some of my friends who served in Afghanistan like the book and feel that Flynn has a good grasp on how the politics and loyalties -- or lack thereof -- happen there.  A thriller.  Good plot and characters.  I am familiar with much of the armament, and Flynn did not disappoint me with impossible deeds. A good read, as usual.  I couldn't wait for the book to be offered as a special, paid the price for it, and it was worth it.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|It's alright, kinda like 500 pages to set the story up.  So far the second and third books are way better.

B005MYEPXC|1.0|After years of perfect shopping experiences with Amazon, I'm sorry to say that I'll think twice before ordering DVDs from the site ever again.  Almost a year ago, I ordered this blue-ray disc from Amazon and found that all audio EXCEPT THE DIALOGUE during the feature film played normally.  Never imagining that a problem like this would be consistent throughout the inventory, I ordered it again.  Fool me once, shame on you... Fool me twice, lose a customer.  I'll be returning the item tomorrow.

B00AMBK0X4|2.0|this movie had a few ups, but most of it felt like downgraded family guy that would of never been put into an episode. the plot starts one way. he spends time with his bear smoking pot. to another plot get rid of him. then to another plot an evil fat kid that grew up to be a strict parent with a fat evil kid that want to steal the bear... sums it up
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Again Michael Connelly wins, this is a very good and suspenseful read. Keeps you on the edge of your seat
B009SQRL4U|4.0|My 8 and 12 year old kids loved it. It was unexpected, but very glad we rented it.  Enjoy : )
B004G8ZZHU|2.0|This movie was absolutely boring. Nothing special and the acting was pretty awful. Even Bradley Cooper couldn't save it. It was just another action-packed movie but certainly nothing to write home about. TV series adaptations are usually not that great and this movie is no exception. The story lines were boring and the jokes not that funny.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|The display is cramped and it's a bit difficult to navigate, but It does get the job done.  Still, I'd prefer something closer to the actual ebay site,
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|How did I not know about these slave labor camps in North Korea?  I heard over the years about the hunger and starvation happening in North Korea, but nothing about these camps.  Entire families imprisoned.  Children born into these camps, never knowing anything different.  What was their offense?  Some time back in their family history (maybe as far back as three generations) one of the family members committed some offense (some times small, some times huge) against the government of N. Korea.  The entire family, Parents, Uncles, Aunts, children, everyone would be rounded up and sent to prison for the supposed sins of one person.  There were children doing hard labor from the age of 4.  Sexual relations were not permitted and if found out, the two parties were immediately executed by either shooting or hanging.  Pregnant women and their unborn children were executed.  There were rare exceptions where two people were permitted to marry as a reward for doing good work.  This young man was born of such a &#34;marriage&#34;. Camp prisoners were also rewarded for snitching on each other.  No one had ever escaped from these camps and lived to tell the story until this young man escaped.  It was difficult to put this true story down.  A very good book.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Who could not love this movie? It is absolutely hilarious! I love to watch it any time of the year just for something to laugh about. We watched this over Thanksgiving weekend this year and two of my cousins had never seen it! It was so fun to see their reactions to the shenanigans of the Griswold family.

B000009DUY|5.0|John Williams has composed some of the most recognizeable themes in modern history, but it baffles my mind that &#34;Hymn to the Fallen&#34; has not received more attention. I find this to be the most beautifully haunting piece of music that I have ever heard.

B008KOMMTA|3.0|I was disappointed to have to get three of these, all having the inside damaged in the same fashion. What does that say to me? Design flaw! Just get the regular Blu-Ray because the inside of your collector's edition will be destroyed anyway.

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|After getting hooked on series one, I couldn't wait for series two! It is incredibly rare to follow something like Downton series one and best it. With all of the drama from the Great War and the changes that were happening the society, this period is ripe with drama and intrigue.<br /><br />I can only count a few instances in my life where TV or a movie has had me rendered immobile and on the edge of my seat, but the last few minutes of the Christmas special did just that.

B008R5OJXE|3.0|I was awaiting this eagerly after a wonderful experience with Alcina by Curtis and his band. I found this recording surprisingly dull. There is a sense of placidness to the proceedings and conductor and singers just seem to go through the motions. This robs any sense of drama from the listening experience. When you add the lack of any real vocal bravado and elegance with the lines, you end up with a rather lifeless rendering of this fantastic opera. The singers are all high quality with star timbres but are strangely uninvolved for some reason.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the Cesare; I enjoyed Lemieux in the Vivaldi recordings over the years. She brings her same rich voice and astonishing facility in the lower registers to this piece but she sounds oddly miscast. The low notes seem to be forced and disconnected to the rest of her range and the vibrato can be distracting. It's frustrating as I find her voice a lot richer and more suitable to this part than Jennifer Larmore's on the Jacobs set but Larmore sings with so much more cavalier abandon and sprezzatura that is the essence of the part. And when compared to the astonishing Kristina Hammerstrom on the Petrou set, Lemieux certain falls far behind in terms of elegance, charm and refinement. Lemieux has a fabulous instrument, but she doesn't really rise to the admittedly stiff competition in this part.<br /><br />Gauvin's Cleopatra is just plain boring, if I may be blunt. Vocally she doesn't seem to be entirely comfortable. Her voice seems to have taken on a darker, deeper hue that I haven't noticed in her other recordings but her upper register also now sounds rather tight and constricted. Opportunities for the voice to soar just aren't taken and Gauvin's Cleopatra is a dutiful but very grounded affair. Her voice lacks the natural warmth of Kozena, who hypnotised with her Se Pieta on the Minkowski set or the clarity and pluckiness of Schlick for Jacobs. She's a lot better than the lady on the Petrou recordingin terms of technique and tone but I was expecting a lot more from Gauvin -- maybe Cleopatra just isn't her role.<br /><br />The supporting roles suffer from a similar lack of purpose and direction. Bernada Fink and Romina Basso remain unsurpassed.<br /><br />I guess the one thing I did take away from this recording is a realisation of just how darn good the Jacobs recording is. Other recordings have had its moments (Petrou's inspired casting of Hammerstrom as Cesare) but the Jacobs remains the standard. Fans of the individual singers here might want this as further documentation of their singing....but I find little about this to recommend to friends. There are other studio recordings and DVDs I would put before this set. But I guess you can never have too many Cesare recordings.
0810989956|2.0|We bought this for my in-laws to give to our son.  I am disappointed that it had quite a bit of writing in it.  If I would have knew about the writing we would not have gotten that book.  I guess live and learn

B0076DELIG|4.0|I'm a bog Bosch fan, I like getting lost at the end of the day with a good story and mystery, and Harry Bosch has provided many for me personally. Story is not as tight as some others, but compared to so many other serial writers, Connelly continues to combine a great story, good dialogue, believable characters, that make for a good thread throughout the entire book. Most satisfied with the book, recommend it to all who want to escape into a story for bits of the day or evening. A great character, if you like this one, I certainly recommend going back and reading lots of the others.
1402270275|5.0|I loved this book.  I've read some of the other vampire/romance novels out there and this is just so different.  Great start to a series.  I can't wait for more.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn's &#34;Mitch Rapp&#34; books.  I wasn't all that excited about the last couple, but this one was STELLAR.  I loved it.  Up until now, Memorial Day had been my favorite, now it is a pretty close call between the two.  Thanks for writing this!  I really, really enjoyed it!
1416550542|5.0|One of my favorite writers scores again!  Love her characters and the twists and turns she takes with the story.  I never forsee where she is going with the plot!  I love the endings and everything inbetween. You must read it if you love Kate Morton.  And why wouldn't you?!
B003A02W0I|3.0|If you can swallow these bitter pills, this book will work for you:<br /><br />1-Republican = BAD ; Democrat = GOOD<br /><br />2-A U.S. Senator running for President would only have a lone 24-year-old aide as his \\"right hand assistant\\".<br /><br />3-Sloppy science like \\"ice shrinks as it melts\\".<br /><br />4-U.S Special Forces would \\"hunt down and murder\\" American citizens and perform \\"countless executions.\\"<br /><br />5-The aforementioned Special Forces would carry \\"snow-ball guns\\" that Brown cannot describe because they are so ridiculous.<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure, this is the only Dan Brown book I have read and I am a devout Roman Catholic so I know how Mr. Brown likes to shred up facts and twist the truth to sell books.  This being said, I found this book somewhat enjoyable even with the eye strain I got from frequent eye rolling.  I wanted to see how he would end this tale and what an over-the-top ending it was.<br /><br />If you want good hard scientific techo-thrillers, read Michael Crichton.<br />If you want good military/political thrillers, read Tom Clancy.<br /><br />Otherwise, this book will do in a pinch - but don't choke on the pills.

B007OWRBJK|1.0|Pete towsend saves the world of English Rock Music and all done in Love, Peace and Happiness.  If this book was supposed to tell me who he is, then he is a egotistical narcisistic man with too much time to think about the great things he remembers doing.  I'm just not sure that I care to know this as his life.  Snippets of fantastic adventures with no history provided for how these adventures came about.  Thanks Pete for letting me know just how shallow some rock stars can be, and for not explaining why.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|I really don't know why I still can't find a complete Sherlock Holmes with Sidney Paget illustrations. This is not it, and as far as I'm concerned, it's not complete without those illustrations. \\"The Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes\\" doesn't work either because, while I believe it has all the Sidney Paget Illustrations, it doesn't have all Sherlock Holmes stories/novels. If they could combine that book with this book, it would truly be complete.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|love the game. but lose items and game crashes and you cannot get pass certain stages and levels. if they fix the problems it would be great. it takes forever for there techs to get back to you on issues.
0307744434|2.0|I wanted to be enchanted by this book, but I was not.  Something is definitely missing.<br /><br />There are pages and pages of description of beautiful, magical things, but after a while the images become boring.  The beauty is all man-made.  Rarely is there a description of any beauty in the natural world.  No real plants, animals, and rarely a real landscape.  Nor is there any contrast between the beauty of the images and any form of ordinariness or ugliness.<br /><br />The characters' emotions do not ring true.  The love between Marco and Celia does not seem to be based on anything.  There are somewhat sadistic relationships between the magicians and their teachers (in Celia's case, her father), which add to the coldness of the book.<br /><br />This is a book with no warmth and no reality.  It was all on one note.  I was very disappointed.  It left me cold.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my 2.5 year old sister because she just loves it (I have not seen it myself yet, but want to!). It came really fast in the mail- I was surprised. It only took 2 days.
0142410705|5.0|After watching some of the more famous John Green videos online, I was intrigued to find that he is an author. I picked this book up and gave it a read. I was fairly skeptical at first, this being a young-adult novel, but was pleasantly surprised! It's quirky humor appeals to every sort of reader. It somehow manages to mesh &#34;smart&#34; humor (such as the many math related jokes), with sophomoric comedy, tragedy, and romance. Subject line says it all, oddly delightful!
B000YAA68C|5.0|Great price for a great movie. It came in regular time in the mail, and was a wonderful addition to my romcom collection
B000YHG72E|5.0|A must see every Christmas season. Our family finds this movie funny everytime. &#34;The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.&#34;
B0064NTZJO|5.0|POSSIBLE LIGHT SPOILERS BELOW:<br /><br />It's funny, people I know who've seen \\"Drive\\" either love it or absolutely hate it. I fell in love with it in its first five minutes. The movie isn't an action packed extravaganza dripping with testosterone but the opening sequence where the unnamed driver (Ryan Gosling) does his thing as a freelance getaway driver is one of the best openings to a film ever and really helps to sell you on the character and the world he inhabits.<br /><br />I really can't explain what it is about the film that I love so much but there's something about the mood that this film creates and revels in that just wrapped me in its arms and never let me go until the credits started rolling. The music especially makes you feel like you're watching something that would've fit perfectly amidst the roster of films released in the mid to late 80's. It's a haunting film, filled with haunting performances by many fine actors, including Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, Oscar Issac, Christina Hendricks and most surprisingly, Albert Brooks. Trust me, after watching this film, you'll never look at Mr. Brooks the same way again as he plays a character way against type in this film. Ryan Gosling has managed to make me a fan based on this film alone, the only thing I've seen him in as of yet. If you like Gosling, I think it's safe to say you'll like him in this as his character is truly a likable fellow, even if he is a little unhinged.<br /><br />In terms of the technical details, this is a fine looking Blu-Ray that sounds pretty fantastic when it needs to. For example, during the aforementioned chase scene there's a helicopter flyover that just fills up the sound stage, making you feel like there's one hovering a few feet above you. This isn't a movie filled with gunfire and explosions but the surround sound is used to great effect, adding an extra dimension to the music and ambiance of the film that is already in place. The extras are okay, with the best feature of the bunch being an interview with director Nicholas Winding Refn, who goes on at length to talk about many of the facets of the production and how the film came about. It's a very interesting discussion, especially if you're a fan of the film.<br /><br />\\"Drive\\" has become one of my absolute favorite films of the past year. I can't even tell you how many times I've seen it since I initially watched it. If you haven't seen it, I say give it a shot. Just don't go in expecting a non-stop action film and take it for what it's worth and I think you'll appreciate it. If you've already seen it and you're interested in picking up the Blu, I feel comfortable in recommending it. I kind of wish it had a little bit more in the special features department but all in all, it's a solid presentation of a pretty solid film.e best feature of the bunch being an interview with director Nicholas Winding Refn, who goes on at length to talk about many of the facets of the production and how the film came about.

I gave this product a full five star rating, not only because I'm a huge fan of the series but because Amazon makes the English version available to us that's a big plus to me.  If you enjoyed Season's one and two on PBS...then you will be thrilled with Amazon's offerings of both seaons and the new one coming in January.

B0067RQYNW|5.0|I've used this primarily for viewing and editing Excel spreadsheets .  It works well, looks pretty much much like the spreadsheet as seen on a PC .  It doesn't display special characters such as checks - displays them as a u with an umlaut but that's not surprising .  Often that' s the way they print . Editing is easy enough and intuitive.
0374533571|5.0|I admit I saw the movie before I read the book, but they were different enough that I was able to appreciate both of them for their individual merits. The book is about a man who finally leaves a mental health facility (which he refers to as the \\"bad place\\") after a four year stint following a mental breakdown. He comes home looking for silver linings and his movie style happy ending, which will include getting back together with his wife Nikki. Instead he meets Tiffany, a woman dealing with her own mental illness and agrees to help her with a project in exchange for something he wants. The book also talks a lot about football and the impact it has on Pat's entire family.<br /><br />The narration in the story is blunt and often childlike in it's naivety and I really enjoyed that about the book. It was touching without being pretentious. Quick also did a good job of creating a wide variety of relationships we can all relate to. At the core, the book is really about that part of us that hopes for our movie ending, even if that means we are in denial about certain things in our lives we can't change. It gives a window into the life of someone recovering from mental illness, and requires that we be more accepting and understanding of the people around us who may suffer from it.<br /><br />Overall, this was a very endearing and uplifting read. I'd recommend it and the movie based on it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Want to watch a movie with lots of great vocals? This is it. It is very weak on plot (but you didn't want to watch it for the plot), but it has some great examples of acappella tunes. Best to sit back and enjoy the antics of the singers and the songs.

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I'd say this movie was a homage to other, funnier, movies.  Don't get me wrong, this is classified as a comedy so it was definitely supposed to be funny.  I guess the soap squirt on the bear face was the high point and then everything after, and before, was substantially less funny.<br /><br />Having said that, you might as well rent it because if you are actually reading this review then you could be doing something better with your time.
B00A2FSXHK|2.0|I suppose I'm just adding on to everyone else when I say that, if it weren't for the disastrous plot holes that are unbelievably obvious and ruin any sense of reality to a genre of film where a sense of reality is the whole point (particularly in the second half, which makes no sense as a result, with a virtually nonexistent climax), this would really be a great movie. Sadly, that isn't the case, and we're left with a plot that doesn't play by its own rules, which are clearly laid out, and are the meaning behind the entire sci-fi backdrop of \\"precrime\\".<br /><br />To anyone who has yet to see the three absolutely massive ones that destroy the entire film for anyone wanting a coherent plot and not just special effects, they are, in order of severity:<br /><br />1. The main bad guy gets no red ball, which would name him as the murderer. There is no question whatsoever that he didn't even try to hide that he was the murderer except for abusing the \\"echo\\" system, which wouldn't work, because the red ball would still come down with his name right on it. There is no explanation made for this, thus the \\"they're just echoes\\" attempt at fixing this makes no sense whatsoever, and so the whole plot hinges on something that couldn't possibly happen if it followed its own rules. It wouldn't matter even if it were considered an \\"echo\\" murder, because that has nothing to do with the red ball system that predicts the persons involved. This is probably the worst one of all of them.<br /><br />2. The precogs can't see the future, they can only predict someone's state of mind. If they could predict the future, they would see the cops arresting the person who was about to commit the crime, not the person actually committing the crime. What they see never actually happens, it's just that it might happen if the cops don't get there in time. And then we see them get proven wrong again and again repeatedly throughout the movie. So, in actuality, the precogs aren't predicting anything. Theyjust see a murder happening, and the cops go stop it before it happens, except the murder never happens because the cops see it, and that's because of the precog system, who can apparently gauge someone's ability to murder based on their state of mind...Yeah, they don't actually predict anything at all, and the system is insensible, as they're only arresting people based on their state of mind at the time, but not actual murder. This would be like arresting someone for OUI as he's driving to a bar because someone reported that he might drink too much that night and try to drive home. That kind of leaves a bit of room for error, you know?<br /><br />3. The infamous deal with Tom Cruise's optical credentials working at least a full day after he's been publicly announced as on the run from police. Despite that he's a wanted criminal, he can still access everything he used to with a retinal scan. It didn't occur to anyone that he might want to, I don't know, get into the records, exactly like he did?<br /><br />It's really a shame, 'cause everything else in this is a lot of fun to watch. But when the plot is ruined this badly by supermassive plot holes that make *everything* that happens in it literally impossible, it's kind of hard to get absorbed in it.
B004Y6MIXS|1.0|I have the AWUS036H, AWUS036NH, AWUS036NHR and the AWUS036NHA and the NHA is by far the weakest card even with a 14dbi panel antenna. Second weakest is the NHR. You want the older but far better AWUS036H B/G or AWUS036NH B/G/N. Kasens brand is much cheaper though. I have a Kasens 9000 8187L which is great and smokes the NHR/NHA.
6305428042|5.0|How many times can a children's movie say the word &#34;virgin&#34;? The answer is: many. Nonetheless, this fact went over my head the first few times I watched this film (I was in grade school), but just goes to show that there are multiple levels for all ages. I still watch this every year around late October and finally decided to just buy it instead of DVRing the ABC family version. I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't enjoy this film, and it makes a great gift for fall birthdays.

B009HEJXFS|5.0|always good to see MIB! Great actors and and great aliens,awesome special effects and of course the fun! surprising ending.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This app is good and simple. I like that you don't have to go through a bunch of drama to start. Straight to the point and great options
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Lots of excitement as per John Grisham.  It's not his best book, but I enjoyed it.  Some insight into prison life that was very interesting, especially for white collar crime.  Definitely worth the time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this game.  It's lots of fun.  First game I have acquired for my new Kindle Fire HD.  Hope to learn how to play more games soon.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I've read quite a few of Kate Morton's books, and I like her very much.  The Secret Keeper moved rather slowly, but still interesting through 3/4 of the book.  But the ending made it all worth it, and I really didn't see it coming.  It's worth the time to just plod on through.  Believe me, you'll be glad you did.
B009GESJH2|4.0|A good solid effort. Not my favorite Kid Rock cd but still a very good listen. Keep on Rollin', Bobby!!!

1563523302|5.0|Seriously, did he know my grandparents? This book is awesome because it encourages ways to live well but within your means. The biggest lesson I have learned from this book is to really be rich, you have to live 'regular'. Sure, you can take vacations and things like that, but forget the Benz, Prada and bling bling! Those things make your net worth much less. Being a young entrepreneur, I'm very glad I read this and plan to use Stanley's advice to enjoy my life comfortably and securely :)

B007BVOEPI|5.0|I am a big fan of the books and this miniseries is starting out really good. There are a few minor changes and characters that I felt differently about in my reading, but all in all its worth the watch. Especially if your waiting for the next book!
B008ER9QLK|5.0|Much has been written about this production of the Ring at the MET. Reviews of the performances abound and are all over the spectrum.  What makes this a must is the innovation in terms of the production. Even if you don't like \\"the machine\\" there is no doubt that it is an important step in the evolution of what we call a life production.  We have seen many productions where the plot is transformed and transposed in time. Supposedly, the intention is to bring it closer to our present days and reality.  This production leaves it as Wagner wrote it, but brings new technologies to make it closer to what we are by now accustomed to see in movies, while being a life production. How this production will be remembered and its impact on further productions only time will tell. That's why should have it.  This set of Blu-Ray discs includes \\"Wagner's dream\\", a movie about the machine, or better, about what the producer wanted to create with it. It is a movie more about the people than the engineering of the machine, but it is interesting in the context of bringing new technology into the stage, a quite heavy one this time.<br />Musically, it is a very good Ring. I certainly enjoyed. The magic of the music is certainly there.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|I love zombies!  You will too!  But how do you kill something that is already dead?  Good series!  Watch it!

1451638647|5.0|Great addition to the saga. She makes you think in ways your mind isn't used to. The singed edition- you can read her name clearly. She must care to everything well.  She does it.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Awesome freaking movie...best sci fi action flick this year IMO. And the hot babes in the movie doesnt hurt things either
B005LAII12|3.0|American Hollywood comedies have for a while been obsessed with the archetype of the American man-child. I'm not sure which film first started the trend, but Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow have certainly championed it. In so many recent Hollywood comedies, the main character has been a grown man, in his twenties or thirties, who seems to be stuck in perpetual adolescence. The characters are usually smart and witty but lazy and underachieving, have a penchant for drinking or smoking weed and a juvenile sense of humor, but yet - underneath it all - a heart of gold. Despite a wild premise, \\"Ted\\" is, at its core, another film in the pantheon of comedies featuring the archetype of the American man-child.<br /><br />John (Mark Wahlberg) starts the film as a lonely little boy who makes a wish that his teddy bear will come to life and be his best friend forever. His wish is granted, and \\"Ted\\" not only turns from stuffed animal to sentient being, but also becomes an international celebrity. The film then flashes forward 25 or so years later, when John is now a 35 year old rental car service employee who still lives with his sentient teddy bear, whose novelty fame wore off years ago. Only now, the two both speak in adult Boston accents, and enjoy sitting around getting high, watching \\"Flash Gordon\\" and making scatological jokes.<br /><br />This would all be well and good if not for Lori (Mila Kunis), John's girlfriend. Like most films featuring the American man-child, the man-child has somehow managed to attract a beautiful, smart, poised and successful woman. So although Lori loves John, after several years together she begins growing tired of having to share her boyfriend with his crass, pot-smoking teddy bear, and begins wanting a more mature relationship. And so it begins - will John be able to move on from his adolescent inertia in order to hold onto his girl?<br /><br />For the record - this film is very funny. I laughed out loud many times. But underneath the original premise, outrageous humor and overall weirdness that the film often employs, the story of the man-child whose too-perfect girlfriend forces him to finally grow up is incredibly played out.emise, outrageous humor and overall weirdness that the film often employs, the story of the man-child whose too-perfect girlfriend forces him to finally grow up is incredibly played out.

B007N9FKCY|2.0|The game is OK but all you can do is move the bean forward or back. There needs to be a control to increase the height of the jump. The game for a child would become frustrating very quickly.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I do like the 6.1 dts on all the blu ray discs. It gave me a whole new sound on my sound system and besides the Star Wars episode are all classics.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a good read. It went very fast. I did enjoy this ebook. I would recommend this to others.I could see something like this happening.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I was looking forward to this book for quite a while.<br />I found it was a bit draggy in the beginning, but then Michael Connelly picked up the pace and it was true Harry Bosch. I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br />I liked how he is bringing Harry's daughter into the story more as well. I found a few bits of the plot implausible, but it is fiction. All in all, a good read and I was sorry when I was finished with it.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Good Day! I have been a Tom Clancy fan for many years and have literally read every book written by the man. Mr. Clancy's latest series of books involving the group at Hendley Associates has been evolving over the past few years and has reached &#34;full speed&#34;! Threat Vector had me riveted right from the start. The story line is amazing and the technical details are spot on. Of course there is the core group of characters who dominate the story line and they are in rare form in this piece.<br /><br />With the termoil our country is in right now, this novel exemplifies how our great nation SHOULD react in the global arena. At least it gives me some hope that maybe things will be good in the kingdom again!<br /><br />This a MUST read for Clancy fans! Five stars for me....
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Hard to stay awake for entire show, To many low frequency audio effects (noise). Bad sequel. I think it  was a disappointment.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolute perfection!!! Colleen Hoover blows me away with her ability to craft a story that is so beautiful, so heart wrenching, and so brilliant.  It's also her sense of humor and cleverness laced throughout her books that sets her apart from so many authors out there.  I wish I could list the specific little things that I loved about Hopeless but I don't want to ruin it.  I will say that the references from The Jerk had me laughing out loud every single time.  This book also had one of the best last chapters EVER. Very few books elicit tears from me but this one did.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|so far the game has been fun. glad to see it comes with the strategy guide. too often I have wasted money on a game when I hit a snag and the hints just didn't give enough info.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|not as good as the first one..but still awesome and SCARY!!  Its like the first one in that its a not really a season ...more of a miniseries..
B002GYS1FO|4.0|This CD contains The Heavy's most popular songs, 'How You Like Me Now' and 'Short Change Hero'.  These songs alone warrant the purchase of this album, but I can assure you, every song on this CD is worth a listen.<br /><br />The only complaint I have with this album, along with other albums from The Heavy, is that they seem to put their best songs at the start of the CD, and it makes me want to rewind to the earlier tracks midway through.<br /><br />That being said, The Heavy is a great band that is amazing live, and I can't wait for more albums from them.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch finds new techniques and procedures in solving a 20-year old &#34;cold&#34; case.  Michael Connelly has the reader turning pages at breakneck speed.  I enjoyed this Harry Bosch novel best of all.  I hope that Connelly's imagination can continue to produce such great reads.
B00973DDN2|4.0|I just downloaded this so I could listen to it before I go to the concert in a couple days.  I've listened to it front to back a couple of times.  Good stuff as always from The Killers

B002BWP49C|5.0|I am a complete fan of the entire Twilight Saga and as such my review is biased...but I totally loved Breaking Dawn Part 1, especially the wedding, the honeymoon and the birth. Also think Taylor did a great job of 'imprinting' on a doll.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is amazing. I really thought it was going to be a waste of my time with bad acting like StepUp. Well this movie is above and beyond and musical or dancing movie out there!
B005LAIHY0|2.0|The lead character of this movie ( Noomi Rapace) made the best with a poor script that went nowhere. The main plot has been done hundreds of times in films like : The X-Files, 2001:Space Odyssey, Star Trek and The Twilight Zone Series.<br />The special effects are great and without a doubt pleasant to the eye but the script lack of cohesiveness leaves the viewer unimpressed and urging for more.<br />If you are a science-fiction fan, you won't be disappointed; although, some forethought would not hurt to say the least.<br />In summary, a lot of good actors made this movie pleasant to watch; but, it will keep you from coming back for more.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|great movie. it kept me in suspense from the time the moview started. I really recommended. Don't think about it just rent it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent virsion of standard Solitaire. i like the clear graphics and the optional autocomplete. It plays well on my Android device.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works fine, arrived promptly.  Cat chewed the last one multiple times.  Necessary tool for avid readers.  Wish it cost less.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I think I read it all in one day, maybe two.  It SUCKED me in immediately.  Howey has got to be the best author I've seen in a long time and this has got to be one of the best dystopian books ever.  GREAT read.  I would not classify this book as young adult but probably appropriate for high school and up.  (I feel like this genre is almost always in the Young Adult category and there's YA that adults can read and YA that is for pre-teens.)  I say high school and up because of the content (there's some death involved) but it's a very clean book otherwise.  (I love an author who totally could get away with cursing but chooses not to.  Shows actual talent.)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the app! I like that it's simple and easy. I also love that it is completly free. You should get it.

1609611543|5.0|if you believe that sharing important info with integrity is job #1, you will appreciate this book.  Dr. Davis has told his story, and if you read what he has found out, you will not be able face your family and friends in the same way again.  You can not deny what you learned from those you care about. I am happy to have learned from Dr. Davis.  What you learn as you read, will come to life as soon as you interact with others in your life.  Very nice concept.  Highly recommend this book to all who need validated research.<br /><br />As for my personal story - the info allowed me to achieve the goals i had set, ahead of schedule - i have exceeded my initial results - and with the weight loss and energy increase i have been able to revise my goals upwards again.  progress being made weekly, and goals are revised upwards once again.  i am satisfied with my purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|DISCLAMIER: Do NOT start this book at midnight like I did....you will never go to sleep. I woke up next to my iPad (that was dead) and super sad because I had to wait for it to charge before I could finish this beautiful story.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Colleen Hoover (I love Slammed and Point of No Retreat) but I really think she took it beyond with this book. I don't even know how to give this book a review or highlight my favorite parts because I feel I would be writing the entire book down.<br /><br />Linden Sky Davis is a 17 year old girl who is being raised by her Wall-Flower Mom, Karen, and lives next door to her best friend, Six. Karen is a Vegan who can not stand technology so Sky has never had a cell phone, a TV, Computer/Internet...and she has always been home schooled. After begging her mother, Karen finally decides to let Sky go to public school for her senior year. Now, the only friend she has is Six and Six has developed a certain promiscuous reputation...<br /><br />\\"Lust is the best of all deadly sins.\\"<br /><br />...and now Sky is also guilty by association. Sky has had her share of boys to make out with but still holds her V-Card. The reason she wants to make out with different boys is kind of sad...<br /><br />\\"The real reason I enjoy making out with guys is simply because it makes me feel completely and comfortably numb.\\"<br /><br />She feels nothing, no excitement, no butterflies...empty.

Or maybe I'm coming down with a stomach virus.\\"<br /><br />He swears that he knows her but can't place her...either way he has to know her.<br /><br />They have so much in common especially the fact that rumors are going around about them in school so they have to decide do they believe what they hear or just ask each other...it takes a minute but this is most open and closed relationship I have ever read about. They ask each other any and every question...they have a game they play all the time to get to know each other...all the while, Holder is holding on to a dark secret.<br /><br />Their relationship is full of angst and tension, but it so innocently cute at times...<br /><br />\\"Anything.

0785163174|1.0|Phoenix - the fiery and all-powerful being that possessed Jean Grey in the &#34;Dark Phoenix Saga&#34; - is returning to Earth because the &#34;creative&#34; directors at Marvel have run out of ideas and are desperately ransacking past, greater storylines for their new books. The vessel Phoenix is going to choose, everyone thinks, will be Hope, the first and only mutant born after Scarlet Witch's &#34;No More Mutants&#34; curse. Captain America and co. remember the devastation brought about by Phoenix the last time it visited Earth and bonded with Jean Grey, so they are understandably terrified of this happening again. If Hope is to be the new Phoenix, she must die. But Cyclops and co. believe Phoenix's return will signal the rebirth of the mutant race and undo the damage caused by Scarlet Witch. If Hope is to be the new Phoenix, she must live. And so we have Avengers Vs. X-Men, a massive Royal Rumble of superheroes sparked by an argument about a being nobody fully understands and a possibility nobody knows will happen for sure.<br /><br />I did actually find the first cycle of fighting exciting and thought that with the fighting out of the way so early, maybe this predictable scenario would take a different turn? However, that initial burst of interest was long eclipsed by the sheer banality of the rest of the story and unrelenting tedium of the endless fighting.<br /><br />Superhero comics are more than just fighting but that's all this superhero book is: fight fight fight. And despite having a massive cast of characters, all of whom have decades of defined personalities, this book essentially wipes away all traces of them so they're all monotone dullards. Spider-man (in his brief appearances) doesn't crack jokes or say anything witty or interesting because all this fighting is all so serious. Iron Man is basically relegated to the side-lines to scientifically figure out how to beat Phoenix (by the way, where's Reed Richards?) so when he appears he's talking boring science crap; his charming, roguish personality is entirely absent.<br /><br />Instead, arguably the two most boring characters in the Marvel U are given centre stage: Cyclops and Captain America. Cap is whiter than white bread and with his no-nonsense manner of speaking is about as interesting: he is practical, dull, and unimaginative, repeatedly yelling &#34;Avengers Assemble!&#34; way too many times. Cyclops has the personality of a brick. When he's not being told what to do by his girlfriend, he's whining about mutants being an endangered species for the billionth time, wittering on like a fussy hen and glumly looking into the middle distance. These have got to be the most tedious men to ever headline a superhero comic. Long before this book was over I wanted both of these dudes dead, never to return.<br /><br />My edition was the mammoth 568 page hardback. After the Avengers Vs. X-Men #0-#12 main issue story arc comes the #1-#6 AVX issues which are just fights. At least with the main storyline there are respites from the fighting to attempt including some sorely needed elements like dialogue, ideas, character and plot development (despite none of these things being effectively pulled off); with AVX, it's just fighting. So we get some arbitrary fights with Iron Man Vs Magneto, Magik Vs Black Widow, Namor Vs Thing, and so on. These are fights that are supposed to be happening in the main story but were separate to keep that story from slowing down. It was with AVX that I realised why Marvel had asked a WWE wrestler to intro this book - these fights were the comic book equivalent of WWE wrestling: staged, colourful, and meaningless. (The wrestler is CM Punk who incorrectly calls his foreword to the book a &#34;forward&#34; - yep, that's the level of intelligence this book elicits).<br /><br />Finishing off this book is Infinite Comics #1, #6 and #10. Infinite was created for the sole purpose of reading comics digitally on tablets, which is a great idea. Content-wise, these comics rehash the events already gone over in the main story arc but with added pages that don't improve the story. Consequently, like AVX, Infinite feels like an unnecessary add-on.<br /><br />And speaking of unnecessary add-ons, you may be wondering what the &#34;AR&#34; boxes appearing on every other page in the book mean - &#34;Augmented Reality&#34; is another innovative feature by Marvel to integrate interactive content into their comics. Because when I read comics, I always think, this is good but what I really want when reading is to watch video. It's a strange idea to insert video of artists informing the reader how they came up with a particular design choice for the panel but how interested are you in hearing about that really? It depends on the reader but I'm not one of those who needs to know everything about the creation of a comic. Also, I read to read - I'm not some ADHD kid who needs to flick from reading to watching video and back again every few panels.<br /><br />Some of the best comics writers working today worked on this book. Jason Aaron, one of my favourite comics writers, has written a great run on Wolverine and is working on the even better Wolverine & the X-Men title; Ed Brubaker wrote one of the most acclaimed Captain America books ever; Jonathan Hickman's doing stellar work on FF and Fantastic Four; and Brian Michael Bendis, whose work on Ultimate Spider-man, Marvel's flagship character, speaks for itself: 12 years of first class writing and counting, his stewardship of that character has been invaluable to Marvel and readers alike. And yet, all of them worked on this book and all of them failed to create an interesting story. Too many cooks in the kitchen maybe? But it makes me think that maybe it's not just the writers who should be blamed for this awful book but the dodgy creative direction at Marvel who steered this book into such unfathomably crap waters. Either way, despite this book having enormous talent attached, it is a massive artistic failure.<br /><br />So another year, another lacklustre Marvel Comics event. &#34;Avengers Vs X-Men&#34; is for those who enjoy WWE wrestling and like to play with gadgets and watch videos rather than read a comic straight through. This book is dumber than Lou Ferrigno's pants. It's also for people who don't care much about anything related to good storytelling, like character development, memorable scenes and dialogue, and good writing - just superheroes punching one another. This review is already too long so I won't go into the many plot holes the flimsy premise of this book rests upon but suffice it to say &#34;Avengers Vs X-Men&#34; is a cynical, contrived, bloated mess of a book that, despite its immense bluster, is ultimately a very small, piecemeal story with forgettable moments offering nothing of substance.<br /><br />If someone tells you this is a good book and is worth reading, be very suspicious. Chances are they're waiting for you to fall asleep somewhere around the 300th page and umpteenth consequence-free fight, then steal your kidneys. But I'd wake up! you say. Oh no - reading this boring book is far more potent than camphor. You won't awaken until it's all over. To re-iterate: read this and you will lose your kidneys to the black market and die. To avoid this inevitable fate, stay far away from &#34;Avengers Vs. X-Men&#34;. But who wins? you ask, the Avengers or the X-Men? Nobody wins, you poor soul. We all lose by reading this.wise, these comics rehash the events already gone over in the main story arc but with added pages that don't improve the story. Consequently, like AVX, Infinite feels like an unnecessary add-on.<br /><br />And speaking of unnecessary add-ons, you may be wondering what the &#34;AR&#34; boxes appearing on every other page in the book mean - &#34;Augmented Reality&#34; is another innovative feature by Marvel to integrate interactive content into their comics.

Jason Aaron, one of my favourite comics writers, has written a great run on Wolverine and is working on the even better Wolverine & the X-Men title; Ed Brubaker wrote one of the most acclaimed Captain America books ever; Jonathan Hickman's doing stellar work on FF and Fantastic Four; and Brian Michael Bendis, whose work on Ultimate Spider-man, Marvel's flagship character, speaks for itself: 12 years of first class writing and counting, his stewardship of that character has been invaluable to Marvel and readers alike. And yet, all of them worked on this book and all of them failed to create an interesting story. Too many cooks in the kitchen maybe? But it makes me think that maybe it's not just the writers who should be blamed for this awful book but the dodgy creative direction at Marvel who steered this book into such unfathomably crap waters. Either way, despite this book having enormous talent attached, itis a massive artistic failure.<br /><br />So another year, another lacklustre Marvel Comics event. &#34;Avengers Vs X-Men&#34; is for those who enjoy WWE wrestling and like to play with gadgets and watch videos rather than read a comic straight through. This book is dumber than Lou Ferrigno's pants. It's also for people who don't care much about anything related to good storytelling, like character development, memorable scenes and dialogue, and good writing - just superheroes punching one another. This review is already too long so I won't go into the many plot holes the flimsy premise of this book rests upon but suffice it to say &#34;Avengers Vs X-Men&#34; is a cynical, contrived, bloated mess of a book that, despite its immense bluster, is ultimately a very small, piecemeal story with forgettable moments offering nothing of substance.<br /><br />If someone tells you this is a good book and is worth reading, be very suspicious. Chances are they're waiting for you to fall asleep somewhere around the 300th page and umpteenth consequence-free fight, then steal your kidneys. But I'd wake up! you say. Oh no - reading this boring book is far more potent than camphor. You won't awaken until it's all over. To re-iterate: read this and you will lose your kidneys to the black market and die. To avoid this inevitable fate, stay far away from &#34;Avengers Vs. X-Men&#34;. But who wins? you ask, the Avengers or the X-Men? Nobody wins, you poor soul. We all lose by reading this.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I've read the whole series, and the books truly are amazing!  Usually, when I go to see a movie after reading such an amazing book, I am disappointed at how far the movie detours and detracts from the book.  In this case, they really did seem to try to retain as many of the details and facets from the book as possible.  The movie maintained the feel and purpose of the book.  I would be curious though if those who did not read the book caught many of those details, but the movie seems like it can easily stand on its own as well.  I'm very much looking forward to the next movie!
B006S8QB2O|5.0|One of the best movies EVER!!  It ended too soon.  I had friends over to see it and we all loved it.
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|SPOILER-FREE!<br /><br />First off, let me just say that GRRM is an amazing storyteller (also my favorite author). He's created a whole new world with its own history with complex characters and wicked plot twists around every page. The character depth in the series is excellent making it very difficult to pick a favorite character. Even the characters that I love to hate are brilliantly written. I have highlighted my favorite quips and phrases from each of the books. There's so many cause GRRM is just that much of a badass writer! I love that the chapters are divided by giving each character their own perspective. This allows me to see the world through their eyes and then view that same scene through a different character's point of view. Unlike other fantasy books, the characters in ASOIAF are not purely good or evil. Not all characters are lovable but their actions are justified (in their minds, at least) even though it often affects the world and people around them in a negative way. It's a domino effect.<br /><br />This an ADULT fantasy series. There is incest, rape, violence and war. Profanity abounds. This is all in accordance to the time and world that GRRM has created. If you have an aversion to any of those - maybe this isn't the series for you.<br />It has political intrigue where everybody has a claim to the Iron Throne and elements of magic which do not detract from the central storyline. Non-fantasy readers should give book 1 a try. There is little to almost no magic in the first novel.<br /><br />Marvelous, epic, dark and twisted -- this is not an easy, mindless read. I really had to challenge myself to remember who all the characters were by reading the appendices in between books ... but ohhhh, how I love getting lost in the world of Westeros.<br /><br />Prepare to invest a lot of time and emotion into the series. There are only five books out with two more still to follow. I really hope GRRM is able to finish this series. I HAVE to know how it all ends!ends!
B004SIP7F8|4.0|One of my favorites of all time.  However, you have to plan on doing nothing else while viewing it. Enjoyment
B008IJT0CE|5.0|If you ever wabt to stop a zombie horror, just play this app abd all the zombies will go back to there dirt naps.
B005CRQ3H0|4.0|`Inherent Vice' doesn't approach the heights of 'V' or 'Gravity's Rainbow', much less Pynchon's masterpiece, 'Mason and Dixon.' Pynchon fans may be saddened to find this a different and more workaday novel. But workaday for Pynchon is still pretty good. If you'd never read the man, you might enjoy (or, equally, dislike) a number of elements here. First, as Louis Menand pointed out in the New Yorker, this is a long and funny riff on the classic LA detective novel. Second, it picks up the rich California visions of 'The Crying of Lot 49' -- taking you back, slightly, to the sense of early Pynchon. Third, 'Inherent Vice' has a lot less of the mysterious, sometimes maddening, mist that Pynchon likes to float between his scenes and scrims; we seldom journey here through time or between continents in increasingly unlikely conveyances. (Am I the only one who found 'Against the Day' a bit much?)<br />Finally, as an inducement, this is a rich, funny, and slightly wistful long goodbye to the sixties by one of the greatest authors the era produced. Street hemis, novelty rock-soul-surf songs, Southern Cal landmarks and shortcuts from Mulholland Drive to Topanga Canyon, beach bums, huaraches, and plenty of marijuana. When Pynchon set out to riff on Hammett and Chandler, he first replaced the whiskey in the desk drawer with weed.<br />People who value tidy or engrossing mystery plots may jump ship here, and without the reverence inspired in a great novel, others may rebel against Pynchon traditions like funky made-up names and half-resolved mystic-funny, psychedelic-ominous scenes. You will probably not remember all the characters as you go along, or be able to tie up all the plot threads as they drift by, but as Menand points out, those too were features of `The Big Sleep' and 'The Long Goodbye.' For that matter, the same accusations can be made against 'Ulysses' or 'War and Peace.' Let's be clear: `Inherent Vice' will never even glimpse such rarefied altitudes, but Pynchon hasdwelt among the heights, and, for his fans or intrepid newcomers alike, even the dope-laced LA smog can be a rich satisfying atmosphere.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I like a good mystery story and this one hits the spot.  It's fast paced and the characters click together.
1400052173|5.0|This book lived up to the hype. It was a real page-turner that provided indepth info about it's subject and about the science of DNA. It allows you to connect on the most basic level.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|its a great story, couldn't put the book down but its extremely tragic.  i would definitely recommend it but be warned its a sad story.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|i love the killers so i am biased but it is another great album from them. I would recommend it
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|It had some funny parts, but its not a movie I would watch again. Worth seeing once I suppose. Enjoy
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Having been a huge fan of the original movie, I couldn't imagine that today's movie technology and stars like Farrell, Beckinsdale, and Biel could not outdo the previous version.  Well, I was wrong.  The stunning effects couldn't save a flat story, one without the nuances of the previous version.  A cast of uninteresting characters and a modified back story had this one fall on it's face. Very disappointing.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|A great start to the series. Good plot with great acting with a somewhat believable plot. Can't wait to view more!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved this book! I couldn't hardly put it down. Defiantly recommend to anyone who wants a page turner! Only thing I didn't like was the ending.. Kind of left me wanting more.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Must have been hard to act out part with an animal character. The language was absolutely horrible and just further degraded the movie. The theme was not bad but the writing of the lines was so substandard that even teenagers could see the stupidity of the entire movie production. Was hard to get thru watching this one. Disappointed in Mark Wahlberg for doing this one.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This is an awesome album! It is a lot about sex, but they are different styled songs so you don't feel like you are listening to the same song over and over. Bruno's voice is amazing and you can really hear how amazing his talent really is. It is a GREAT album!!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I was so happy with this app I downloaded it for my phone also. The app tells you how much time for calls, music, videos, and will  alert you when power is low
0316228532|5.0|Certainly not for the faint hearted. I bought the book for two reasons - firstly because of it being Rowling's first novel since the Harry Potter series, and secondly because I'm an English woman living in America and wanted something to \\"take me home\\" just for a little while. And that it certainly did. It's raw, bleak, desperate - just like my old home area of Liverpool. Her characters are alive, and I absolutely LOVED how she could write different sections of the book from different characters' personal viewpoints with such vivid insight into how they felt. I've read several books where this was a prominent feature, but \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is by far the best for that split-personality aspect.<br /><br />The story itself is harsh and uncompromising, but so very very real because of that. It's definitely not a children's book. The events and general subject matter are much more adult, and tragic. If you read it not knowing it was written by J.K.Rowling, you'd never know it WAS written by her. My respect for her writing was always great with the Potter books - now she's moved up to a totally higher level and I think it's little short of AWESOME.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|it isxa really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really good game you should get it
B007GCY8FS|5.0|No way is Cruise Jack Reacher. This latest Lee Child novel does not disappoint, Reacher is still a smart, giant who always kicks ass.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I haven't been able to figure out why my scores are consistently lower than other players.  Good tool for hand/eye coordination though.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|First Sherlock Holmes I've ever seen that was very close to reality. The original and most of the myriad copies down thru the yrs are fantasy.  Altho this one is also, it is is much more believable and the mysteries are some of the best on TV.  Adding to the entertainment is the interesting personal relationships that are developing. Good show. Hope it is popular enough to continue for several seasons.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this app. does what is suppossed to do. the best weather app that I was able to find for kindle
B007I0RA26|5.0|This book is awesome.  I love how the vintage pictures make the story!  I already bought copies for my friends.
B005LAII3U|4.0|Great movie but the original was much better.  If you like action then this movie is for you.  The only thing lacking were the special effects and futuristic world depicted in the original
B003NX76BM|5.0|Loved the book and learning about rescue dogs and their owners!! Loved the main characters and had to laugh at their banter. I would recommend this book highly
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of Stephen Kings best books ever!  Worth reading twice! For someone that grew up during that period of time, it really took me back to a great time in my life.  Made me yearn for the time before the internet, cell phones, microwaves and color tvs!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Big disappointment. Only a few levels are really played like angry birds, I only played those. It's more like the Angry Birds Space, I did not like that either.  Where is a new Angry Birds Rio?????????I have played that three times. Love it. Not the space birds...
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I was pleased with the price (cheaper than walmart) and by how fast I got it. I can't wait to crack it open:)
B007N85POS|5.0|Come on Rovio. Time for a new Angry Birds Rio. It's th ebest game ever. I've played this 3 complete times. Lets start updating it or come up with a new Rio.  Ido not like the new Pig Games or the Angry Birds Space Games. Give me a new Rio already!!!!!
B00354YA2M|4.0|I live in Australia, and I learnt things about my own country from reading this. Bill's cultural observations were spot on.<br /><br />Read it - pick out the places that sound most interesting to you and come visit !!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Love Love Love it. I would very much like to read more from Ms. Collins.
B006O99SYA|5.0|I found the murder mystery a real page turner, but what I loved most was the vivid description of the life in China<br />for British ex-pats and locals, combined with the turbulent changes afoot with Japanese invasion and world war impending.<br /><br />Well researched true story and extremely well written.
B005LAII80|5.0|Didn't really have any expectations going into this movie, but I was really blown away. Great cinematography, acting, and soundtrack. One of my favorite movies of 2012.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I read the book coz it was a free download on the Amazon website. Not too bad! Some nice quotes in there.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it is a great read. This is my second time reading it and I still can not put it down! I own the movie as well and I cannot wait for the second one. I would recommend this book to anyone. However my nine year old wants to read it and I feel it is inappropriate for someone his age. It is a complex and serious story that will go over his understanding. However, amazing book, but I would make sure you have the time to devote to it because once you start you can't stop.
B00433SVP6|5.0|This book has really shown off Riordan's exceptional writing skills. His merging of Roman and Greek mythology is wonderful and a pretty novel idea. You will fall in love with Jason as much as you did with Percy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show! It has awesome details blood, violence everything you could want for a zombie show! Team Daryl :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome. It provides me hours and hours of time when I was bored. And the fact that it is free makes it even better. I would highly recommend this game.
B0086700CM|3.0|I think its good but sometimes when you slide down it goes a different direction. But over all its pretty fun and addicting
B007X4ECLY|5.0|&#34;Boy saves girl&#34; is a staple of movie plots. This iteration adds little to the fundamental storyline but the actors are very watchable and the &#34;off-world prison&#34; location adds some &#34;fun&#34; for those with an interest - however small - in soft science fiction.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have it on me fone and its really good so I wanted it to be bigger so last Christmas I ask me mom to get it she did but now I cant buy it help anyone???
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I have used this pen on a number of touch screen devices and it has performed well on each one.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|A great boy flick - just what we ordered and the kids enjoyed it immensely - watched it several times...
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Great movie, although I still like Robert Downey at the Iron Man!  I remember Rathbone as Sherlock.  But Downey did well.
B0043D2L9S|5.0|Wow.  What a difference this makes with the Deluxe Technical Belt.  I took off the chest strap connector, and I don't even buckle the belt of the Technical Belt any more.  When wearing a black polo shirt it's not conspicuous, and it's a lot more comfortable than without the harness.  If you lose the dorky front strap connector it's a winner.  The only use for that would be mountain climbing.  For sideline sports photography I can do without the connector.  The shoulder connectors are nice - toss on a carabiner or two and my secondary body hangs from the shoulder and I don't have to worry about it slipping off.  It attaches in 30 seconds and adjustments are a breeze.  This is a real winner and a must have if you have more than a pouch or two connected to the belt.<br /><br />My only real negative is for myself for waiting to buy this.  I should have bought it when I bought the belt!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Anything Batman is going to be good.  This is Evil over Bad and good viewing.  Recommended very well, but some things I don't think would be good for very young children.
B002YVAT72|4.0|It was very easy to set up and use. The quality of the digital conversion was excellent. The software was consistent with other software that I have used from the same company.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I've read some really good books this year but this one is my favorite.  Good mystery with credible characters.  I will be looking for more books by Kate Morton.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I had to get the Kindle app for my computer to start and then, when I got my smartphone, I just HAD to have it on there.  It's PERFECT for when I'm on my way to get my child from school, just open it up and read while I wait.  And all I have to do is close the app when I'm done and put my phone in my pocket.  Soo much easier than trying to carry around a book.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Gives you closure for Data. Very well written book. I  would definitely recommend this book to trek lovers......thank you for reading my review
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Not nearly as entertaining as the previous two movies.  Its a good idea to review the first two before you watch this one.  It does have some funny moments after you are well into the action.
B007THA4FI|1.0|What a disappointment that the writer of Harry Potter should write a book in which she dislikes every single person in the book except the girl who is prostituting herself and making decisions for the most noble reasons, but every one a disastrous decision.<br /><br />Not a single positive adult except the one who died at the beginning of the book and she even cast doubt on his ethics.<br /><br />A total waste of a read and such a sad let-down
B005IQZB14|4.0|I enjoyed the book but it seemed she spent too much time on her angst. Quite an undertaking for her. Not smart alone.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I purchased the book to help understand the movie.  It did clear some things up but went in enough different directions to allow for suprises.  Now that I &#34;understand&#34; both I think David Mitchell set himself a challenged and then indulged in the pursuit of that challenge without worrying about the fact that none of the strories was compelling by itself.  The trick of incorporating stories within stroies is cute but adds nothing special for the reader.  Occassionally Mitchell fails to acheive his own goal of changing writing styles for each story.  Some phrases leak from story to story and become anachrnoistic in their use.  In the end, I find all the stories to be a rant against humans using humans to their own ends especially through corporations and religion.  I never did decide whether he was for or against unions but assume against since his general trend is toward negativity.<br />I found Wikipedia's comments about the story more helpful than my reading of the book.  Wikipedia is correct.  If you are a student of literature this book might have something to offer.  If you are looking for entertainment, there are better sources.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Best Bosch so far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Keep them coming Mr Michael Connelly. Both my spouse and I enjoyed this the very most.
B0067RQYNW|2.0|I needed this app to open a wps document. The document is five pages long. Most of the first page is not readable, garbled.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is the edited version of many songs, but I really enjoy it. It is the soundtrack to the show Love in Las Vegas. Many of the original recordings have been modified for theatrics, and this is just that track. If you want original music, buy something else.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Absolutely awesome! I watch the show with my 10 year old son every week. They are doing a terrific job
B002ZCY7QY|4.0|Not sure what the story is on these BluRay discs.  The transfer quality is poor.  I'm not sure if they were just trying to get as many episodes on one disk as possible and over-compressed it, or if they just had poor source material to begin with.  I don't remember these ever loooking this bad on television.  As the series went on, you can see improvements in the picture quallty, with season 5 being the best.  Besides that though, I love the show.  I never missed an episode on television, and bought the entire set when the series ended.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|It's a good album for relaxing and driving as weird as that sounds, but it also has a few up beat tracks that pick up in the second half of the album.
B001DHXT1G|3.0|Apparently, and I didn't know this when I bought it, the &#34;free&#34; digital copies that come with many of these movies expire before you ever get to use them.  I think it should be more clearly stated when you buy something if it isn't going to work past a certain date.  Hate wasting money on something you can't use.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|I was looking for something that would allow me to save energy...not show me something I already know. this is the same kind of app that infest the apple store. why not make it something like JuiceDefender, it disables connectivity while the screen is off, you control the frequency of sync, etc.
B003R0MF5S|4.0|Not sure what the story is on these BluRay discs.  The transfer quality is poor.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book kept me captivated the entire time. I could not set it down. The best part was that it was the final chapter of the hunger games trilogy so I was already hooked from the very first book!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I already have this on DVD, but thought I would upgrade to BluRay, as this is one of my favorite holiday movies.  I watch it at least twice every Christmas.  I was surprised to see that the quality was noticeable better than the upconverted DVD.  I'm glad I made the purchase.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I am not really sure exactly how it works or how to get more points. It is fun to play though.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This is the edited version of many songs, but I really enjoy it.  It is the soundtrack to the show Love in Las Vegas.  Many of the original recordings have been modified for theatrics, and this is just that track.  If you want original music, buy something else.  I really enjoy the Audio DVD.  It sounds great in surround and offers both Dolby and DTS recordings.  You just have to go into the options and select them, before you press play.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|good puzzle game! short but sweet. good visual not to wordy with the storyline. puzzles were different and the search was easy
B003SI5NX0|5.0|Oliver and Company was my very first favorite Walt Disney Movie.  I would like to buy this if it goes on sale.
B00004YM0D|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies so we decided to get the soundtrack.  It arrived in excellent condition.  While its not the kind of music I usually listen to, it is enjoyable and exactly what I expected.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|I'm in love with the music, the songs, its a great cartoon.  I own it on Blu-ray but had to get it for my Ipad.
B001JRB16U|5.0|A classic, fun movie.  Merely replacing my old VHS copy with DVD so I can enjoy it over and over.
048629823X|4.0|This is one of the most incredible works that I have read.  It's is interesting to hear wisdom that applies even today from someone who lived so long ago.  My only complaint is that the translation could have been better.  Some of the thoughts run on and on and on making this a difficult read sometimes.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|it could of been better, it is a good book don't get me wrong but it needs something I just don't know what
0470876417|5.0|I HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK, BUT I TOOK TIME TO EXPLORE IT, THIS SEEMS LIKE A MUST HAVE BOOK IN YOUR LIBRARY IF YOU WANT TO ADD VALUE IN THE BUSINESS AREA WITH INNOVATION
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game. Easy to start and enjoy.  A must have for card enthusiasts.  I highly recommend this game.  Great game play on the Kindle.
B000VXJMYG|5.0|Some of the best songs by Supertramp.  Everyone's a Nervous Wreck, Breakfast in America, Logical Song, Child of Vision - all extremely great songs.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|you gave me 2 year 5 disks (order of the phoenix) and it is missing year 7 part 1. can you fix this somehow? i can send the extra one back
B006C45MRE|2.0|Lots of shiny computer graphics with notable actors giving little life to a terrible script with a story of cowboys and Aliens.
B00AAQ7LP6|5.0|rihanna continues to prove with this concert dvd that she is at the top of the music world. A must for any Rihanna fan
B00A861QMM|5.0|Great hide and find game excellent mini games and well worth the price for this game challenging and fun to play
B0077EBWVI|1.0|this is a gift for my granddaughter so I can't rate this DVD<br />I haven't seen it thank you very much
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This is a most enjoyable book - very funny - very positive - and actually two stories in one. Read it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Obsessed with this series, couldn't put these books down.  Oh fifty shades I want one too.  I just didn't want it to end.  Can't wait for the movie.
1449410243|2.0|Started out funny, then became not so funny.  I might pass it onto someone who's more connected to office life.
0375714839|5.0|I think that the book was actuallly really entertaining, i also followed up with the movie which is equally as good, and thats rare usually the books are better :)!<br /><br />The author does a great job using her illustrations to depict the literary devices and aspects thats he employed throughout her book
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Thought it would be good but wasn't for me.  I don't like stories that keep going back a few days or hours.  Hard to keep focused on the story line.  I deleted it after a few chapters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the Hunger Games trilogy! It's enough actions and adventure to keep the reader entertained while adding some underlying romantic moments. I like this series so much because its not the typical lovey-dovey teenage girl read; it's a journey of a heroine who struggles through tough choices. I enjoy how it's written because although you figured out the ultimate ending, you have no clue how the story will arrive there-meaning its not predictable. I'm very happy with this purchase!! I would recommend this whole series.
1600610234|5.0|This is a great book for any artist who wants to learn about the process that Doug Chiang relies on to create Sci-Fi concepts in 2D. The subjects covered are vessels, robots, creatures, vehicles, and drama scenes. The main strength of the book are the stages from start to finish of every concept. Each stage of progression is clearly shown and briefly described. In fact, the stages have been selected so well that they are self explanatory. The techniques covered include both traditional and digital, and there are specific instructions on what to do in different situations. The writing style is clear and to the point with no unnecessary filler. This is not a complete beginner book. Some experience and an understanding of the basics of design and illustration is required. Having said that, this is a valuable beginner to intermediate level book for a person who has the basics but wants to learn about the 2D Sci-Fi concept creation.

B005GRTNVE|5.0|I received this quickly and in excellent condition.  It is almost like being at an Il Divo concert when I watch it.
B007THA4FI|2.0|If JK Rowling was intending to shock with this book she definitely reached her mark.  The language was vulgar and unnecessary.  I lived in the UK in the 1960s and the book had a very retro feel to it; it felt vaguely familiar yet it was supposed to be set in current times.  It was as though the author was trying to drag images from her past and make them current.  The UK I see now does not resemble her descriptions.  A total waste of money and time.  Unfortunately I was reading it as part of a book club study or I'd have given up earlier on it.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Ok at best, it took along time for the movie to pick up any momentum.  I will say the last 10 minutes were probably the best part of the movie.  Is it worth seeing?  Sure, it finishes the story of the Dark Knight series.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I downloaded this app because it was free. with that in mind, its not fancy but basic and easy to use. If you just want a no fuss alarm app. this is it.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This movie was entertaining, but I felt as if the producers tried to hard to separate this movie from the other Bourne movies.  There were times when the plot became very slow and hard to follow, especially in the beginning.
1423124960|1.0|The stories themselves are fine, not Pulitzer Prize material, but exactly what you'd expect for what the book is. My 2-year-old goes bonkers for them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book itself smells. Like fish. On every page. The pages also stick together, but I wouldn't bother writing a review to complain about that by itself.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Daniel Craig is the best of all 007's IMHO.  I love the opening scene with the chase going on as the palio is being run in Sienna.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case is a knockoff. I thought I was saving a few bucks but its not a real lifeproof. It's made of all plastic and the switch on the side fell off before I even put it on my phone. I will be returning it and getting a real lifeproof.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Great full feature app. let's me know everything I need to know for the cities I travel to. thank you.
0399160450|5.0|This book is true Tom Clancy suspense. You cannot put this book down. It is fast paced and a thrilling story.
B0041D843M|5.0|A must read!  The last part on goverment, pharmaceuticals, the meat & dairy corporations and the medical establishment is a real eye opener!
B0015DROBO|5.0|One of the most intricate plots I have read in a long time.  It was complicated but well laid out and easy to follow. Awesome book, have recommended it to many people.  It made a great movie, but the book was better.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|it is a majong game of speed. you can always clear the tiles because if ther are no more matches it lets you reshuffle.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book during the summer and am just getting around to writing a review. For me this was the most exciting read of the year. The story starts with 2 characters about to celebrate their 5th wedding anniversary. However, when something happens to one of the character the story starts a long path to a mind blowing twist.<br />I do not want spoil any of the plot for would readers but simply give this book a try and it will leave you with an odd feeling after reading it. I know it sounds cliche but I could not stop reading this. This was the first book I read by this author and after I read this one I immediately bought [[ASIN:B002U3CCKQ Dark Places]] and after I was through reading it I bought [[ASIN:B002U3CCF6 Sharp Objects]]. I am certainly a fan for life of this terrific author.
1881273873|4.0|This book did sort of open my eyes to a variety of views on the subject of love. I actually am very intrested on how the human mind works so i drew conclusions on people actually recieve and portray love. Basicly we all have different ways of expressing love, and this book will show you how to love your partner just the way they need to be loved so they actually relate to you .
B0027Z9C2I|2.0|My family enjoys the movie just fine, but on Amazon Prime's streaming, the audio continuously desynced with the video. We've never had this issue on any other stream.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|the game is very good. it keeps your interest the only thing is you get dinged for moving the picture to see everything up close
1451608659|3.0|I remember watching Dominique at the 1996 and being absolutely in love with her, she was beautiful and a great athlete, but I didn't fail to notice how unhappy she looked as well. Off Balance definitely offers some insight into what was going in her personal life and why such a child seemed unhappy. I found her USA Gymanstics, Olympic recounting and her insight into the Karolys (who I'm sorry but sound like asshats) the most interesting part of this book. However, Dominique herself was heavily impacted by meeting her long lost sister Jennifer, who was given up for adoption when Domi was very young, the most interesting part of her story. Yes it's a remarkable story, interesting one too, but I just found Domi's gymnastics' accounts far more interesting and couldn't wait to get to those parts so to me this is why the book lacked pacing.
B006O3MU96|5.0|yay it is the best game like ever I love it It may be the same as Doodle jump but it has the crunch and stuff I love it hay hay hay yay<br />o
B000002L9B|5.0|My daughter is collecting Prince stuff.. so this was a God send. Great to be able to find him used, in good quality, and price
B0054JZC6E|3.0|For games to just pass time..it does the job. Some are more challenging than others. A couple of the games I cant get to work right but again its a time passer. I need more practice.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|With the film currently receiving rave reviews and books generally being better than the movies, I was greatly looking forward to reading this. Despite never really being pleased (or enthralled) along the way, I kept reading in the hopes things would improve.  Unfortunately, that never happened.  Everyone's proclamations about how this book would make you believe in God were absurd.  This story is completely overhyped.  Wikipedia indicated that 5 publishing houses rejected the book.  I can completely understand why.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|This book was very easy to read and kept my interest. There are frequent unforeseen events that occur that impact the story in an interesting way.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|This delves deeper into the thinking of treadstone, the science behind it. Turns out Jason Bourne was not alone out there.<br />Also the science was not able to overcome the humanity of their agents.<br />this is for anyone who loves the 007, and MI type action movies.<br />you get a sense of Jason Bourne's second movie when Jeremy Renner protects his gal. but only slightly.<br />I would give 5 stars if it  never ended. Loved It  - can't wait for the next one.<br /><br />Mike S.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|AHHHHHH! I love this game! I was lookin everywhere for a slender game like this! the first time I played it I literally jumped! if you want a slender game like the Pc. THIS IS IT! I also think its perfect on the kindle fire.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is a great writer! This book was amazing on so many levels. I can't recommend it enough! A MUST read!! I loved her other books, and Hopeless exceeded all expectations. Her best work IMO! Love, tragedy, hope, grief...it has it all.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|A really good, scary show that doesn't include gun violence, thank God. These folks know how to spin a tale that's oddly in tune with our times. I&#34;m a little put-off by all the time shifting of the plot lines. I'm never quite sure which century I'm in. Nonetheless, great cast, lots of plot twisting. Well worth your time.
B000E5N6LG|4.0|good old fashion  cowboy , western movies. I happen to like Mr. Cosner. So it was nice to catch his earliest  roles.
B004LWZW88|5.0|OK, we're all watching Shrek and here comes this fussy feline. And everybody's yelling: Spinoff!!! Spinoff! And here it is. And it includes all the wonderful bits that we've come to love. The whole movie is a clever backstory about how the cat got his attitude. I'm expecting another wherein Puss learns how to do battle with the Bad Guys, as long as we're doing Zorro parallels. Where is the wise Anthony Hopkins mentor that shows him the way of the world and how to use a sword? What about the boots? I thought the original was about him realizing he didn't need the boots to be excellent; it was all in his head. Run off to iTunes and get the movie soundtrack, there's some classic south-of-the-border themes in there, well played.
B006RED4GA|1.0|was told it would be disturbing, it wasn't. Also the acting was ridiculous. big disappointment. but i will watch more movies
B009KKLQKO|4.0|I saw the Beach Boys live last spring before they started their 50th anniversary tour. At first I was disappointed Brian Wilson was not on stage and the audio engineer was placing too much emphasis on the guest drummer (John Stamos). I got over it and got into the groove as Mike Love and Bruce Johnston put on their charm and engaged the audience.<br /><br />Lack of time and monetary resources kept me from attending any of the 50th anniversary live performances. But I easily came up with the $13 to obtain the DVD.<br /><br />Yes, the produces left out half of the good stuff, but the other half is still there. Brian Wilson and Al Jardine were both there with the the other surviving original members. They're getting old, but like old friends you just want to run up to each one and give him a big hug. Brian Wilson even seemed to enjoy the spotlight from time to time.<br />And they still sound great!<br />If the producers come out with volume 2, put my name on a copy and get it to me immediately!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am hooked on this book. It is full of surprises and I definitely recommend this as a must read or a gift for book lovers.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|would not let me download it sucks it is a good game on computer but ducks on here do mot recomend

B009UMTMKS|5.0|It is so good but pictures is not enough and there are just text and text.I did not like the paragraphing
B009S33I68|5.0|Though this book is straight history and not fiction, it draws you in on a personal level, to the fight for the Ia Drang valley. It gives you insite to the new technology of the First Air Cavalry, the thoughts of the officers and fighting men on both sides of this battle, and the political struggle of the United States to adequately combat this new &#34;Enemy&#34; that it did not well understand.  I was Old enough during this era to remember news reports of the day,but now for the first time I understand the strategies of the armies, on both sides and what they hoped to gain. I also felt like I knew these men.  they were real for the first time not just numbers of dead and wounded.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|What can one say about Dickens - one of the greatest writers in English of all times. The illustrations make this a real joy for the Christmas. A note: this is not a religious book even though it has ghosts etc. The real theme of the book is the possibilities of the human heart. It is a timeless story and being tied to Christmas simply ties it to a European Tribal Ritual.
B005FSI1IK|4.0|With this book, I have now read all the Vorkosigan books and stories that I can find in publication.  A great series.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I long ago outgrew Lego's though they played a huge part of my childhood. So I was really excited to order the Shuttle Expedition set that I plan on displaying in my soon-to-be born child's room. I'm happy to say that after all these years Lego's are still a satisfying activity and a lot of fun.<br /><br />This set consists of 1230 pieces spread out over about a dozen plastic bags. Pieces range in size from miniscule clear window wedge-shapes and single pieces of the heat-shield all the way to large sections of the solid rocket boosters and liquid fuel tank. I grew up with NASA's STS program and vividly remember watching launch after launch as the decades passed. I remember the day in Kindergarten when we assembled to watch the launch of STS-51 (January 28 1986) and watched in confusion as the Challenger disintegrated shortly after launch. The STS program played such a large role in my childhood and really served as an inspiration for what mankind can do. In getting this set I hope to pass a little bit of the awe and inspiration to my child even if this is just a toy it represents much, much more.<br /><br />Assembling this set is a task that my wife and I worked on over about a week. There are two instruction manuals with about 60-pages apiece that must be followed. Assembly is intricate and interesting in that you start at a base layer and slowly build up upon that. The shuttle is the first (and most impressive) piece to be built followed by the solid-rocket boosters and finally the distinctive burnt-orange liquid fuel tank.<br /><br />The shuttle is also the most intricate part of the entire set and features a fully functional front and rear landing gear assembly that retracts and deploys. The landing gear is surprisingly solid (you'll assemble it of course) and more than up to the task of holding the weight of the set. The cargo bay doors also fully retract to reveal the cargo area complete with the shuttle's famous robotic arm and a satellite to deploy. The arm is also very sturdy and articulates in all directions and again, sturdy enough to hold the weight of the satellite.<br /><br />The entire set rests on a smallish launch pad that is really the only disappointing aspect of this set. A bit more detail and realism here would've made this set absolutely top-notch. As is the set rests securely on the specially designed base. I'm planning on suspending this set from the ceiling using fishing line or something similar so I won't have to use the base but it is a bit sparse. The set comes complete with 3 Lego men/women. One ground grew vehicle and as I stated before a satellite for the shuttle's cargo bay.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to not just displaying this set and using it as a teaching tool for my child but also as something that we can disassemble and reassemble over and over again.<br /><br />Very much recommended!is also very sturdy and articulates in all directions and again, sturdy enough to hold the weight of the satellite.<br /><br />The entire set rests on a smallish launch pad that is really the only disappointing aspect of this set.

B004SBQAN8|4.0|I've read the books and decided to try out the movie. The movie was good but didn't follow the book as well as I hoped. If the movie would of followed the book more, I believe it would have been more of a success.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I need all the help I can get when it comes to spelling. The same sound is not allways spelled the same because of how it is used, like 2, two, too or to.
B009LRE040|5.0|Nolan's batman series is hand's down the best super hero treatment since the original star wars movies. Only time will tell if it holds up as well though. While there were some small flaws with the film, I was overall satisfied with this film both as a stand alone product and as a cap to the trilogy. My biggest gripe was with Bane's voice... I think it prevented a deeper connection to the character, which is a shame because Nolan's depiction of Bane was actually deeper than I would have expected based on my knowledge of him from the comics. If you've enjoyed the first two movies, you will love this one as well.
B003204MQS|3.0|These movies never meet my expectations. I want them to be good so badly! This one has its moments, but mostly I just can't stand the characters!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|This book, a continuation of the Kay Scarpetta series, was my least favorite.  The first 20% of the book dealt with a grueling description of a sea turtle.  The story line was flat, the characters seemed colorless and the story line was dull, uninspired and disjointed.  All in all, I was very disappointed with the book.  I have enjoyed the series up to now, Scarpetta being my favorite, but will not continue unless the story line and characterization improve in the future.
