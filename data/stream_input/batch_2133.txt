B0064T6LV8|3.0|Great game and graphics.  Downloaded to my kindle and a little awkward to play.  I have to take the leather cover off to be able to hold and operate the flippers.  Can't play for too long without my hands getting tired.
B0041T4ML4|4.0|Great look at a possible future based on quite a different thought of what currency could be distilled down to.  A great read for many possible audiences.  Would make a fantastic movie!
B0016CVN02|5.0|All popular songs.  Great all-around album.  Now it'll just be a special song here and there to download to round it all out.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is awesome but with very few flaws the only one i saw was you couldn't do every thing you could on computer if you can get past that this app is amazing and fun and if i could of i would of really have given this app something like a 4.75
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome could use some  more upgrades more people  and lower prices for the  hover boards and change  the Sean every 6 months
B008VJYWMY|5.0|Love IL Divo, everything they do is great. Great, great great Great, great great Great, great greatGreat, great greatGreat, great great
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|I love this album and am doubly glad I purchased the CD and the cloud version because the cloud version skips, a lot
B007704HO6|5.0|A wonderful, poignant story about failure & renewed hope, trust & love through an extraordinary cat named Bob. I couldn't put it down. I recommend it to ALL cat lovers & anyone else who has ever been \\"down\\"! I laud James Bowen for his devotion to Bob & for his complete honesty in telling their story.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Could not put this game down. Super fun and addicting.  Great story line and super graphics. Worth every dime. Again I will warn all, really addicting!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|It was hard to follow and I didn't like the ending. I didn't appreciate Dallas<br /> being bashed as Lee Harvey Oswald was certainly not a Dallasite.
0920668372|5.0|The simple text and winning illustrations chronicle the child through adulthood and the baby who once received love from a caring parent now loves and cares for that parent, now a dependent elder.  A circle of life story.
B0001US8FI|5.0|The quality of the feature film is excellent as is the special features included in this 2 disk set. I highly recommend this for any Bruce Lee or martial arts fan!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I'm so upset the game auto updated and now I have to start over....was a level 40 with a lotbof money and buildings! deleting!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|The anti glair sheet was difficult to put on and it left bubbles on the screen. I don,t think I will order them again.
B007SGM084|5.0|Probably should have bought them individually - lending  them as a 3-pack was difficult for the amount of time allowed.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I think that my case is great. It fits my kindle perfect and it also can stand up. And that is all I have to say.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I got this for my 6 year old grandson and he is crazy about it.  he plays it every chance he gets:)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game in the world. It is fun and challenging. Like if you love this game. Cause I do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it hopefully we'll see more movies like this.  Makes you want to see more and more movies like this.  Everyone I talk to just can't wait to get the next series!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Only worth it if you don't have to pay for it, great as a present but not worth 7 dollars
0486282112|4.0|The Impact this book had on 19th century literature is undeniable. Shelly's 18 year old mind couldn't have crafted a better book. Any Fan of Frankenstein or Science-Fiction should read the Mother of all Sci-fi books.
B005T87QCI|4.0|This game is awesome but you have to pay more money for the robots that are the main characters,it needs a little work.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good and relaxing. my daughter and I play it together. she likes doing the treats. I wish it was easier to get gems though.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|IT WAS ALSO ACTION PACKED THE ENDING DID SURPRISE ME  BUT I ENJOYED IT ANYWAY AS USUAL STEVEN SEAGAL FILIMS ARE STILL MY FAVORITE
B005MMYPIE|5.0|If you are looking for some good metal but want something unique; look no farther than Amaranthe. They bring to the table the heavy tunes that I was looking for but also show a softer side in the music, such as the song Amaranthine. 5 out 5 for the voice work and music. Next cd is pre-ordered!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have a lot of fun with this app. Its super additive. I always end up having to play it for hours.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|My daughter and I can't stop listening to this CD. The up beat sounds are infectious .  A great buy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the best game ever! although the stuff in the shop should be cheaper also u should make the multiplier be able to go till 50 and add more characters.
0439023491|5.0|I love the story in these books and they were a good price and quality. The book came quickly and is in great condition.
0670824399|5.0|Unwilling to give up my own copy of Matilda, I bought a copy for my granddaughter, who has come to love the story as much as I.  Now I can't wait to take her to see Miss Trunchbull on Broadway!
1594744769|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite books and I am looking forward to hopefully a next one. The story is great and I love how it works around the wonderful pictures.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I loved this movie. That is why I got  all 3 at the same time. Blu ray definitely does it justice.
0439023513|5.0|I love these Hunger Games books and looked forward to reading all of them. The price was great and I was able to finish the story quickly because they were so addicting.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Are all those 5 star reviews for real?  This was awful.  I did finish it, but just about put it down about 5 times because it was so poorly written.  Not to mention the main character is a manipulative a-hole.  There was nothing romantic about this book, unless you are into unhealthy, dysfunctional relationships.
B005GVF95O|5.0|My son loves this game and he does not get mad about not being able to do the puzzles. He has been playing this since he was 3 and he is still in love with it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its so simple I'm addicted. its challenging and fun. the controls are simple and its the challenge I'm looking for
0345803507|5.0|I am astounded by how much you can really enjoy this book And actually imagine yourself in that situation. Great book!
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was so bad. I read the entire book waiting for something to happen, it never did. I'm sorry I spent $12.99 on this.
0345803493|5.0|Excellent book hands down. I am actually back into reading because of this series. Im not able to put this book down.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This was one of the first games downloaded when I got my Kindle. I had hours of fun with it. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|Wish some of the extras had the original Pepsi commercial that was inspired by the movie. Great old 80s classic movie with lots of action
B00021R7CG|5.0|Great Movie! One  of my favorites! I saw them on Amazon and had to have them, a lot better than trying to catch on tv. Price was great and shipping was fast!
B008X9Z4I8|4.0|This is a very nice cover for my Kindle.  It gives good proctection and padding.  My one problem with it is that only one of the zippers works.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|What can one say about a cinematic classic like this?  Having this film in Blu-ray format is a pleasure; timeless story, superb acting, beautiful cinematography, etc.  The price on Amazon was also great; bought it for my adult son who loves movies, very glad I did.  It's a long running time flick, but you'll be engaged throughout!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|The game is certainly addictive, much like a 3D Mahjong cube type game where you spin the cube and match the squares, a very cool concept. However, I knew as soon as I started playing that the color contrasts would be a problem and I was right, my eyes immediately began hurting and after a few rounds I had a headache and had to quit. I really wish this was in more neutral colors as these really bother my eyes.<br />That said, I do enjoy the game itself. The first game is simply a clear all match, and the second is one that starts the opposite way, with only four squares at the base, adding squares as time goes. You have to hurry to clear them as more are added, as another reviewer compared this, much like Tetris, I agree, a 3D cube like Tetris. Once the cube is full, you're done. You're out to beat record times in this, which is cool, but it would be nice if there were harder levels as well.<br />All in all a pretty cool puzzle game, just hurts my eyes and that is really why I give it four out of five stars. Definitely recommended though!
B008NNNF7G|5.0|I can't even tell you how much I love this band and their music.  The are incredibly talented musicians and song writers - so much better than anything else out their today.  They are what is RIGHT with southern rock! They are also incredibly nice guys too!  love love love them.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Love it.  Only two places where it is messed up.  But they do not last long so it is ok.  Good color and good quality other than that.  Love the Twilight and have all of it.<br />That Edward, what a babe,.  Get the entire series.  Annie
B00846F1YW|2.0|read reviews before I ordered , but soon found out that there are still problems with program. One review said that game stuck on level 11, but was fixed and worked okay. I have tried 5 times to get past level 11 and finally figured out that glitch was not fixed, so am deleting app now,
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I have used this a little on my Canon 7D and my Sony Audio recorder and it works justs great. I made my own &#34;Dead Cat&#34; wind screen by purchasing material at a material store and making a simple pattern from newspaper and then sewing it together. I ran several tests with my home made windscreen and it helps in a five mile per hour wind. Nice and compact and very light. The battery compartment is a little difficult to open/close, but worth the money.
B0009WQ3P0|4.0|A 4 disc set should present the best of all a band's albums. Instead you get only 10 songs from Peter Green, 8 songs from the six albums made post-Green/pre-Nicks and TWELVE songs from Tusk. Whoever compiled the box must love that album. But Tusk is not their most popular album and only had ONE big hit song. Tusk has no more than 4 above average songs on the whole album. So filling over half of one disc out of the 4 in the box set when you have 15 other albums to pick from was a big mistake when you think that there will probably never be another 4 disc set from this band. You do get over 70 songs in the box and most are excellent. It's just unfathomable how anyone could be entrusted to put this set together and not know that Future Games, Bare Trees and Mystery To Me are all better albums than Tusk. People who like Tusk already own that album. What needed more exposure and remastering were the great Kirwan and Welch songs from 71 to 73.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved the original story. And enjoyed the voice narration.  This was my first book to read in my kindle and it won't be my last.  Five stars I rate this book.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I highly recommend this to everyone!!!! He and all military personnel are heroes and this book proves why. A must read
034580404X|5.0|Love, love these books.  This was def. the way to buy good books.  I had them all read in less than 1-1/2 weeks
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Works great when you are bored and have a few minutes to kill.  Great when at airport or in doctor's office.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I really love this DVD, and am looking forward to watching it in the very near future.  Thanks so much!!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|plans dont always snch and keep track of your reading progress. overall nicse to have the Bible  always with you. it would be better if NIV version was available offline. instead of just kjv. offline note taking &amp; highlighting would be a useful feature.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I really love this DVD, and am looking forward to watching it in the very near future.  Thanks so much!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I like this as it protects the Fire, but is not bulky and is easily packed when traveling.I can easily fit in my purse or carry on.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|I really loved this DVD, but I wished that I had known that this episode was already on the Season 2 DVD.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I am a full grown man and over 60, but this is as classic as &#34;Gone With The Wind&#34; for Japanese Anama.  A story of youth that learns the lessons of selfconfidence, hard work and perserverance under conditions which she did not ask for, nor for which she was prepared to face at the age it was thrust upon her. Amazing film work for the year it was produced.
B0090SVDO0|5.0|One of the best live Doors concerts I have heard, the guys had it all together that night. I have been a long time Doors fan.<br />And have been to four Doors concerts in Philly back in the day. A must for your collection.
B00003CXBK|5.0|My teenage daughter, back when she was one turned me on to this movie.  I still enjoy it.  A most have for everyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much fun and i love the new ropes the only thing is is that it doesnt have all the characters from the first but otherwise its AMAZING!!!!
B009369Z8A|5.0|this was on my husband's wish list for xmas. now he has it for his collection, he loved the movie, fast shipping and a great price
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|One of the most imaginative works of fiction I've read. Dick weaves a web that is extremely fun to untangle.
B008M721MS|3.0|I have trouble getting on Skype once I'm on it's great but it's the getting on that's troublesome any clues?
B003Z39G0O|5.0|I can practically watch the show while I listen to the soundtrack. Very pleased with the number of songs and amount of time I received it in!
B001L1S1SK|5.0|This season is as funny as the older ones. For me it was just wonderful and I enjoyed a lot.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|It wasn't as good as the Phantom of the Opera but it did answer a lot of questions that were left from the original. Loved the scenery and the actors did a wonderful job.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I am a fan of Sex & the City and I was able to have the entire series in a neat package.
B004GEB9UQ|4.0|If you're looking to go Paleo, this is a great resource.  However, this is a great resource if you want to learn about the reasoning behind the diet.  If you're looking to go Paleo solely for the losing weight benefits, I would recommend you follow the basics: protein and vegetables.  No dairy, legumes, rice, sugars, or processed foods... there may be more!  I always find is so funny when I read Pinterest recipes that are &#34;paleo&#34;.  They're like &#34;Paleo&#34; bread.  A true &#34;Paleo&#34; diet follower would not be eating bread.  Stick to the foundation.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was completely amazing. I knew it was a good read but I didn't expect it to be so captivating! Buying the second book now!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game is worse in than the original. It is very glitchey which makes it almost unplayable. There are less characters, it is pretty much the same game, and the missions after level 8 are impossible. I got bored and frustrated with it after about 10 minutes. I also one time was on a run of over 8 million and I died. So I tired a revive and it quit the app and took me back to my kindle' s home. I was so angry I that I have not played it since. I hate this game for those reasons and many others. I would advise getting the original instead and pass this one up.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a lovely story, well-told.  I did not think I would enjoy a book about a boy and a tiger so much. It was a story about survival and so much more.  It was quite thought-provoking.  I only hope the movie does not spoil the book!

0399157565|5.0|Cornwell further polished her creativity. This time she wove forensic process as the warp and Scarpetta's emotional conflict as the woof into substantial and well worth reading. Story develops while verifying advance hints scattered in the story one by one. Scarpetta shows dexterous professionalism even under teetering female psychology, which incurs killer's displeasure. Most thrilling part would be where she is followed by Douglas Burke. It is a moment we feel doubtful about Burke who might hinder Scarpetta's work with violence.<br /><br />Processing details of profiling, cyber analysis and computing approach to find a killer is hidden from the reader. We only know updated findings from the mouth of Benton, Valerie Harn and Lucy when they directly talk with Scarpetta. Even Marino is made his exit in the midst of the book. This technique makes a story much more mysterious, and forces us dive into Scarpetta's state of mind. We all give a sigh of relief when she is rescued from the capture and find they all care about Scarpetta more than she does for them.<br /><br />Cornwell fill some trivia in her story. I found onion being lethal to cat and historical changes of painting material from this book. Does Janet's come back as a lawyer suggest a hint for the next episode?

0399160450|5.0|Fascinated by roller coasting story, couldn't place a marker in the book to retire to bed. Really overwhelming part was where Marine attacked Guangzhou. At the time Chinese army locked on a Japanese SDF vessel nearby the Senkaku islands, North Korea claimed their success in the third Nuclear testing, the story amplified the threat vector of the real world.<br />The story of Ryan family began to take an aspect like Three Kingdoms( or Sangoku-shi, old Chinese history.) What kind of another threat is coming up to stand in their way after the suppression of Chinese reckless drive. Eagerly looking forward to the next episode.

B002SRQ214|5.0|Purchased to upgrade from a slow amd duol core cpu that came with my computer. Read a few reviews about this super fast 3.4Ghz AMD Phenom and decided to take a chance. Made the right decidion. My PC is 10X faster now and it was a breeze to install it. Please make sure you watch a couple youtube videos on how to insert the cpu so you won't break the pins! I bought the warranty that came with it just in case. But so far so good! Love it!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was an amazing read. I read the trilogy, and set it down for a while because I did not want it to end. Despite the \\"violence\\" (for lack of a better word,) this is a story of maturity, growth, sacrifice and love. The last pages brought tears to my eyes, and reinforced the notion of good in humans. Well done!
1574216988|5.0|Wow! I received this only two days after the order. Great service and product. Would definitely recommend you to someone else.
B004ZG5F0K|5.0|Having had an acquaintance with a women who lived in similar circumstances, I thought this film did an excellent job in portraying this terrible and shameful era in the World's History. We must not forget lest we find ourselves repeating such despicable acts.
B001DMJ9R4|4.0|Great Stuff on this CD. Close to a greatest hits CD. The live DVD is AV7X at their very best
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved reading this whole . series. It keeps you absorbed in all  the adventures that took place. I would recommend them all.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|If you are an AV7X fan, this is the absolute must have CD. Every song on it is kick ass

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Another Lee Child's book I couldn't put down. The story line kept you wanting to see more. Just when you thought you knew where the plot was heading, there would be another surprise. Great book!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved reading this whole . series. It keeps you absorbed in all  the adventures that took place. I would recommend them all.
B009EEFTMC|1.0|Really good game but it must be constantly connected to app store or it stops and to have you log in to appstore before you can continue so when you are traveling it is useless
B008MEM24S|5.0|it is a very good game with an intellectual challenge as well as being fun. it is very entertaining and amusing.
0156012197|5.0|I had read this in highschool and for some reason all the lessons that my teacher had explained about it really stuck with me. I can only look at this book with fondness and is the first thing that comes to mind when some one asks me what my favorite book is. Even if it is technically 'for kids' I think that is one of the points of the book- adults should be able to enjoy the same amount of joy and imagination as children.<br />If you have kids I defiantly almost insist that you read this to them.
B00BFQ292A|5.0|I accidentally ran into this on the CW the other evening. I was pleasantly surprised and decided to buy the season.  It seems that someone has finally created a series about a superhero that is smart, has an interesting backstory and a correctly cast actor in the lead role that makes you believe he is the Arrow.<br /><br />I'm not sure how the critics have seemed to miss this one.  I can only hope that more people find it and support it so it lasts at least a few more seasons.  This is a gem that creates intrigue, a movie feel to every episode, and provides the viewer with a desire to what will happen from episode to episode.<br /><br />Then again, because I like it, it will probably get cancelled.  Just like Firefly.  ;)
1401235417|5.0|I started reading it in Barnes and Noble and I liked it so much that I had to buy it so that I could finish it. I like it especially since it's thicker and has a hard cover- so far the only comic I've actually invested in buying even though I love reading them. I just really love the way that it looks- which was a big reason for why I got it.
0091949300|5.0|I would have never bought a book by Oliver Stone, but, having seen him and his co-author on the Tavis Smilely show, I knew it was one in which I would have an interest.  It has proven to be even better than I thought.  I bought a copy for my mother, as well.  We both love it.  There is so much in there which I knew, because I lived through it, but is not taught in our schools.  This should be required reading in all American History courses, and for anyone with an interest in politics and how we came to be where we are today.
B008F9E306|5.0|This album from Tip is the best in years. I listen to everything but, this is the Tip I like. He's had some great recent albums, however this is more like his &#34;I'm Serious&#34; or older P$C music. Even the more commercial songs are better. I would definitely put this album in my top 3 Rap albums of 2012.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I got this because so many people I know play this game.  I now know why!  It is very fun, and addictive.  I like all the sound effects and visuals.  Got it for FREE thanks!
B004G5ZY7E|3.0|Too predictable and too long getting to the point. Would not readily recommend this book tofamily or friends. I guessed outcome in the beginning.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is an entertaining game that teaches you how to take care of your city and build your own city.It also shows what happens to the population if certain things aren't done.Cool game.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I liked the story plot. It was not predictable and showed a side of life that isnt always portrayed in such a realistic manner
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I didn't expect much going in, but was pleasantly surprised. Sure the story is a little silly but the production values are great. Special effects are fun. Action sequences are exciting. All in all, completely worth a watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is one of my absolute favorites. Great graphics and super fun to play. Great time killer. I loooooove this game. <3.  :)
1907590331|4.0|My son needed this book asap for school, I found a great deal and it cam crisp and clean and it saved my money
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books i've read in a while. It does contain some very serious issues but that being said. IT. IS. AMAZING. Its one of those books that leaves you breathless when you're done like your life has changed as much as the character's. Its beautiful and funny but at the same time dark and intense. Thats the best word I can use to describe this book is INTENSE. Sky and Holder's love is intense their stories are intense. The whole book is truly breathtaking. The author did a great job with this book. All the emotions in this book you will feel also its that great. At times some of the issues are hard to handle but its so worth it to read the book all the way through. And the title. Perfect! \\"Hopeless\\" has so many meanings in this book its not even funny from the hopeless boy to his hope-les life it is amazing. Buy it! you will not regret it
B001F6TXME|5.0|Great, simple, inexpensive product. Prevents camera shake when shooting low light, long exposures and bracket shots. It's on my D7000 24-7!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Never thought I would like this book. I loved it. I would recommend it to my friends. Can't wait to finishing the others.
B00AHXDECG|4.0|Bruno just keeps getting better.  I think he has just scratched the surface of what he is capable of or I would have given it a five star.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun addicting game.my daughter loves it and can't stop playing..have a 6 year old? Cuz they'll love it! I'm 24 and I lob  it!
B000T0XEGS|5.0|If you love opera, this is for you.  I saw this in a theatre so many years ago.  Had to own it.  My VHS tape was so degraded that I had to order the DVD.  Something I will pass on to my grandchildren.  Masterwork.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I did not think I would like this movie ..the story reminds me when I was younger and READ every \\"Hardy Boys\\" books...it's a mystery and they solve it but the filming of this is unusually & beautifully done..never seen this kind of \\"cartoon\\" effect..and the books ,after I did some research, are very popular..so maybe a second one will come out.. that dog is some character.I really loved this movie and never thought I would...great movie for any age group..<br />Cheers..<br />Tony(NYC)
B0015DYIH2|5.0|WOW! That about sums it up! I enjoyed every minute of every hour that I read this series. I wish there was more!<br />I will recommend the entire Twilight Saga books to everyone.<br />I want more!
B003L77G6A|5.0|Ordered Season Four Tuesday evening and it was at the front door three days later on Friday. Don't stop the great service.<br /><br />How do those people at the studio consistently crank out great comedy? Like the other four seasons of The Big Bang Theory it's a winner.<br /><br />The only thing that would improve this program would be to ax the canned laughter. Save it for the guy at the water cooler trying to get a laugh telling dirty jokes.<br /><br />Season Four: worth the short wait and putting up with the innocuous laughter.<br /><br />Love it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is really an excellent mahjong execution, especially considering that it's FREE!  It has excellent graphics, quick and smooth responses to inputs, and sufficiently challenging layouts to keep it interesting.
B0051OZ564|2.0|I didn't get a whole lot out of it.  The way the story line cuts off into no-existant action scences was weird for me and the whole thing was very dramatic and fantasy based.<br /><br />Others might like it though.  The animation is very good and the fight scences are pretty impressive.  There's definitely more action than story line so if that's a plus for you, you might like it.  I thought it was too much flare and not enough movie though.  There is a plot line but it's weird and dramatic and there are random jumps into make believe battles, which I thought threw off the momentum of the story.  Recomend it only if you're in the mood for lots of action and are okay with the over-dramatizations.<br /><br />One last thing.  There's this big thing about the main character dancing but you never see her dance...  That's pretty weird right? Lot's of random stuff that doesn't make any sense.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|very addicting game like it ! Was a free app of day. so I tried it. Its even worth paying for it
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game. Plays properly and enjoyable... like the customization s, hate the adds.don't mind 2 extra keystrokes before each game and you will enjoy it as I do.
0879309210|5.0|I merely have peaked at this book so far; looking for reference material and so forth. But on what I've needed it for as a beginner it has been a great find for me. The DVD that came with it is sort of a abridged version of some other long series on classic guitars and repairs. Which for me was nothing more than a \\"oh that's interesting..\\" Type of thing. My review is only a cursorary statement of fact at best. I feel though ,that  I will need little to no more reference when I go deeper into my guitars and their maintenance .
B009X01GJ2|3.0|To turn the Kindle device with the revolving motion was difficult with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Needed two hands to do it. Returned it.
0307279189|3.0|I have recently taken up running (at age 49), and this book was recommended by a co-worker.  It is an interesting read, with lots of details, from lots of situations, and lots of characters.  The book itself is written in an interesting style of telling a story, with lots of \\"rabbit trails\\" of sub stories along the way.  Much of it is informative, and some of it is quite funny.  My only critique of this book is that some of it drags on a bit too long, and by the end of the book, I was ready for it to end.  I do like the thoughts provoked by the book, and the underlying thoughts behind the Terrahumara philosophy of running.
B001L83PLQ|4.0|I was a child during the civil war. This book is a fiction based on the war and I thoroughly enjoyed, very fast read!
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Great book. Wish there was a next one. Would recommend it for anyone that liked the first two in the series.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|This was a really fun romance. Ms Harrison really has a knack for humorous love stories. I will definitely continue reading this series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is ok some part is a little boring but pretty good game I like it but this game is not fir everyone so glad I started plYing it LOVE it
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Baldacci has a way of developing his stories that makes me unable to put down his books until I am at the end.  This was no exception.  Absolutely loved it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|if u like these kind of games its entertaining. plus a nice little history lesson thrown in the mix. makes me remember the old Oregon trail game played in school on the old apples!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I'm usually real picky about purchasing G5 games bc the prices are sometimes kinda rediculous, but this one was worth every penny!! Great game length, with a unique twisted story line, and beautiful graphics! I played this on my kindle fire and didn't encounter any glitches or problems. Keep up the great work G5, just wish your prices were a little lower.
B005LAII3A|4.0|IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST ONE. IT DOES KEEP YOU INTERESTED. A LOT OF ACTION. IT HAS GREAT ACTORS. IF YOU LIKE ACTION MOVIES. THIS ONE IS ONE OF THEM.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I was late to the party on this series but got hooked like everyone else! The DVD arrived with no problems. Thank you!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it was better than the first one I don't like how there are less characters and money is a lot harder to get.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|What a cast! What action! What romance! Bring on RED 2!!!! No one should miss this..I have watched it three times so far!!!
B002ZG9846|5.0|At the outset of Kick-Ass we start with Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), a very none-descript high school student, who has a couple of equally non-cool sidekicks. Their main interests other than girls, who are not interested in them, is comic books. One day Dave asks his friends why no one ever dresses up in a costume and fights crime for real. One of his friends points out correctly that if one where to actually try that they would get their ass kicked.<br /><br />Dave is undeterred and buys a mail order costume. Eventually he chances to confront a couple of tugs trying to break into someone's car. Yes, he gets his ass kicked. Then he gets stabbed and hit by a car. When he gets out of the hospital and one assumes some physical therapy (not shown), he resumes training to be Kick-Ass his nom de guerre. In his next encounter with crime he fairs somewhat better and fellow teen's cell phone camera videos of his battle with street thugs goes viral on the internet. Kick-Ass becomes a household name. Some someone is even planning a comic book about him.<br /><br />In a parallel story we learn that a former police officer spent five years in prison after being framed for drug dealing by mob boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) after refusing to become corrupt has also become a costumed vigilante. Damon Macready aka Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) has pattered his persona after Adam West version of Batman but with a lot less respect for the law. He has also recruited Mindy, his 11-year-old daughter, into his plan for vengeance. It seems she was a good learner. This duo has funded their operations by stealing drug money from the D'Amico street operatives and accumulated a $3 million dollars cash stash. In an opening scene we see on one such mobster being tortured trying to explain the he didn't take the money but someone looking like batman did.<br /><br />David has had a crush on Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca). She was totally uninterested in him until a rumor spreads that he is gay. Being a liberal young lady, who volunteers at a needle exchange clinic, the idea of having a gay best friend appeals. Not exactly what Dave has in mind but he goes with the chance to be with her. A man she knows from the clinic named Rasul has been bothering Katie and she makes an off hand comment that she could use the helps of someone like Kick-Ass to tell him to leave her alone. Dave seizes the opportunity and soon finds himself is a sleazy apartment surrounded by several dangerous thugs. It looks like this is going to be the end for K-A when in comes Hit Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) who proceeds to kill these rather formidable thugs with some dispatch. Hit Girl is Big Daddy's daughter. This begins loose relationship between the duo and K-A whom they see as a hapless wannabe but as Hit Girl says with some potential.<br /><br />Having seen his complete incompetence next to the duo, Dave has second thoughts about his life a super hero. But, unfortunately for him was misidentified by the mobsters has the individual responsible for deaths of eight of D'Amico's people and the theft of a lot cash. Enter Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), D'Amico's son, who has been spoiling to get into the business with a plan to get Kick-Ass. He assumes the masked identity of Red Mist pretending to be a crime fighter and fan of Kick-Ass. I'll say little more about the plot but that there is plenty of action to come.<br /><br />Clearly Chloe Grace Moretz steals the show. Compared to Hit-Girl the Kick-Ass character is really out of his league even with his rally late in the show. This has not been without some controversy. Film critic Roger Ebert is appalled at the image of a merciless 11-year-old girl killing like its fun. Is this character credible? In fact are any of the super hero movies credible? Or, even most action movies for that matter? Also, I would point out the child soldiers in Africa as an unfortunate example of this possibility not to mention several school shootings in our own country.In fact that is what is disturbing about all of this.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is a rather Tarantino-like flavor with allusion to Superman, Batman, Spiderman, The Matrix, John Woo films, and others. This is a hard R movie and is not for children. It is very funny in places or very disturbing in others. Or, perhaps what is disturbing is that it is funny! Thus forewarned go and enjoy.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Do you just publish what you want and ignore the not so good reports? I reviewed a purchase and it was not as described.  Yall wont even publish it?
B003JUGQ38|5.0|It is a great show! Very clear picture and sound I hope I can afford to get amazon prime again soon
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is fun, i could do without all the ads, its not like i would purchase from an in game ad anyhow
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I had never seen FRINGE. I got the first four seasons DVD sets for Christmas, and wow do I love this series! The presentation is lovely too, with eye-catching lenticular images on the box cover and helpful booklet inside each one. I can't WAIT until the fifth (and sixth? I'm not sure how far along they are, or even if it's still running...) season comes out in another set!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Nice to get to facebook easily with just one button.  Helps me keep in touch with family and friends on the go!
0425252868|5.0|The author's handling of this story was just the right mix of technical information and human interest. As the story unfolded, I found myself experiencing in a real sort of way the danger and uncertaities of the life of a German fighter pilot doing his best to protect his homeland, likewise the moments of sheer terror experienced by the men of the Eight Air Force in their B-17's and B-24's over Europe. The last part of the book is particularly emotional as the fighter pilot and the bomber pilot discover that each is still alive after over 40 years of wondering just what the heck kind of person it was piloting their respective airplanes on that fateful day in 1943.
0765325950|4.0|So it's the end, folks. It's been a great ride. i've personally been a fan of WoT since the age of 13 (18 long years), and i must say that despite the ups and downs, i am pleased with how it's all turned out. AMoL was definitely better written in my opinion than the last two Sanderson/Jordan collabs, and while quite nearly encumbered by the sheer density of battle imagery and the slow start, it was worth the money and time just to see the work of 20+ years reach fruition. Here's my review, and yes, there are spoilers ahead..<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Satisfying, yet not necessarily expected outcomes for most of the important characters. Sure, i wasn't pleased in the least that Egwene died (alright..mad as hell would be more accurate), but the more i thought it over the more it brought me back to the first book when Moiraine told the story of the queen of Manetheren who gave her life channelling too much saidar to defeat the forces of the Dark One after her husband died in battle. That and there's always hope of her rebirth along with Gawyn, similar to Birgitte and Gaidal.<br />-i could see a lot more of Robert Jordan's influence in the writing of this book compared to the previous two..i think i almost cried with happiness when one of the characters \\"sniffed\\" for the first time in forever.<br />-Many plot points are wrapped up, at least to the point where a reader's imagination can fill in the blanks. Yes, there were loose ends left hanging, but i wasn't sad about it.<br />-The \\"epilogue\\" made the book for me. i don't care what the haters say, it makes sense that Rand switched bodies with Moridin and once released from his bonds as the Dragon Reborn, he is nearly returned to his original boyish, adventurous nature we saw in the first book with a few interesting tweaks..the Wheel, as they say, turns. Kudos to them for not choosing a Harry Potter-esque ending.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Battles that seem to merge together with pointless descriptions of Trolloc and Fade demises (i get it's the Last Battle, but really now), not to mention it didn't quite add up in my head that the forces of the light kept getting obliterated and yet still found soldiers out of nowhere to throw at the enemy.<br />-Shara, in general..i mean, you mention the Sharans maybe a handful of times in the previous books and now they're your main rival? Frustrating. In addendum, so THAT'S where Demandred was this whole time?? Just ugh.<br />-The fate of the living Forsaken = weak<br />-Virtually no mention of the Aiel, whether in terms of battle or what may happen to \\"the fragment of a fragment\\" post-battle. Same goes for the Sea Folk.<br />-A dreaded touch of deus ex machina used to wrap up the last bit with the Dark One and with Mat's encounter with Fain especially. I cringed internally when he came out with that whole \\"can't get the same disease twice\\" line. We're talking about concentrated evil here, not chicken pox.<br />-Nearly every secondary character dies..and some so casually and/or briefly! Okay, that's my own personal complaint, but still tossing it out there. It seems to be a common fallback for Sanderson i.e. the Mistborn finale.<br />-Some of the vernacular used by Sanderson just doesn't fit in the WoT world (Mat has always been cheeky, but not 21st century cheeky)<br />-And lastly, WoT is over :(<br /><br />As a side note, i really think it's bad form for users to downvote simply because of an issue with the e-book not coming out until April. That was a decision made by Robert Jordan's widow, people, and you need to respect it. Buy the book or borrow it from a friend if you're that cheap. Vote down if you read it and didn't like it. Simple as that. Also, at least learn how to spell the main characters' names before you go spouting BS comments left and right..it just makes you look like an idiot and a bogus fan who doesn't know what the hell they're talking about.<br /><br />Other than that, just let loose and enjoy. If anything, it's an engaging read.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|I learned a lot of history from the book.  It is a difficult read at times, though, and continuity of the story line varies a lot.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I refused to read this after I had finished the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. I was afraid it would entirely change my view on the previous books - and it did! In a good way, of course. Although I preferred the first person point of view before, the characters in this book are so interesting! I think this is hilarious and sad and moving all at the same time.
B00AFEYUVG|4.0|I absolutely love this movie. It was a great representation of the book. If you've never read the book, highly recommended!<br /><br />Is anyone else's blu-ray quality sorta grainy? Not sure if that's how it was meant to be or not..
B001LF347E|5.0|I love anything King Arthur or Merlin but I had my doubts about buying this series unseen.  I was hooked after the very first program. It's a different twist on the whole story we've heard a million times but is has all the same elements and kind of shows you how things evolved (i.e. Avalon, Lady of the Lake, the Sword in the Stone, Morgana, etc.).  They even got Mary Stewart's Crystal Cave in one of the shows. It's well written and acted.  Well worth the money for the whole series.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It is a fun game that is challenging but not completely frustrating. I do not regret buying this game and will probably play it through all the levels. I just wish that it had more levels.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Installed without any problems.  These i-series CPUs are quite nice.  It may be better to go with a sandy bridge, or these IVY-bridge before considering the older series (esp. with the i7).  If you don't do heavy gaming, and video editing, you probably can get away with an i3 with no problem.  I used the fan that came with it (I am not overclocking, and my case has good airflow).  Very happy.
B004LROMSO|5.0|I wish they never made season one of this series as there will be no more seasons to come. According to IMDB a number of the actors are scheduled for other projects & that is why production has stopped.  I love Arthurian themed tv and movies and the castles & village sets seemed so much more authentic to the era.<br /><br />Arthur starts off as this skinny kid with no regard for Guenevere's relationship  and the actor seemed positively wrong for the roll. He started evolving into a man and king and a 2nd season would have developed his character much further, stronger and better.  Merlin was magnificent. An entirely different yet fully workable & fascinating spin on the man.  I was sorry to see a few of the characters killed off in the first season, I think they were rich for more storytelling.<br /><br />I truly am extremely disappointed that this has come to an end.  I really am. I find myself waiting for whispers of a second season with the original cast even though there is no evidence to support my wish.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so fun love love love love love this awesome game yah. Yahoo Yahoo yah
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The story line took turns that I never expected. This continues to be a great series to watch. I highly recommend it!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I personally have read The Hobbit countless times (as well as the Lord of the Rings). I had a lot of complaints about the Lord of the Rings movies but this one I have to say he did a great job with. Perhaps since he is a well known director now he was able to do more. They stick the the story generally and every-time I thought I was going to get annoyed about a variance they made it tie into the book well enough to make me happy. They are delving more in depth into some of the background that happens in the book that is not elaborated on in the text and add a little to the story then was probably Tolkien's intent, but it works. The casting is amazing, the movie is exciting, the graphics are great, and it is a movie based on one of my all time favorite books. Excellent, I highly recommend it. This is the first time I actually went to the movie theater in at least 6 years and I am glad I did. I anxiously await the release of this movie on DVD.
B004HD61KE|4.0|What a page turner. This book started out late but when it did there was no putting it down .
0785163174|4.0|Get back to your favorite characters and story lines from years past brings back many memories of comics from yester-year.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Good writing but plot has logic flaws.  Not quite the ending I wanted.  Story flowed well so it's an easy read.
B004089HZ2|5.0|Perfectly writen for anyone who loves a story line that has a little bit of smoking involved just like a overdose of nictine patches to start with.

B009POCG0Y|4.0|Killer Joe(released July/12)stars Matthew McConaughey as Det.Joe Cooper,Emile Hirsch as Chris Smith,Juno Temple as Dottie Smith,Gina Gershon as Sharla Smith,Thomas Haden Church as Ansel Smith,and Marc Macaulay as Digger Soames.Deftly directed by William\\"the Exorcist\\"Friedkin,this southern trailer park family story,involving murder with a twist,is an intriguing yet sometimes disturbing film.One minute it's sending up its redneck roots,and the next the action gets as intense as anything you've ever seen.<br />The story introduces us to the Smith family;father Ansel,his life,a slow learning curve,his overbearing son Chris,who treats his dad like a child,Chris's sister Dottie,who is the youngin' of the family,a virgin and quite withdrawn due to\\"family\\" issues,and Ansel's second wife Sharla,who is not a home body,to be sure.It's the old joke,if you look \\"dysfunctional\\" up in the dictionary,you would find their pictures there.Chris it seems has gotten himself into a little jam.He owes the local money man $10,000 and no one in the family has it to give.He is so desperate that he takes the advice of a friend by the name of Rex.Rex tells his buddy that there is a Dallas police detective by the name of Joe that does hits as a sideline.If Chris employs Joe to take down his father's ex wife,the recipient will receive $50,000...that being his young sister Dottie.And besides,Joe only charges $20,000.It sounds like a plan to Chris,who talks to his father about it.He actually gets him drunk,to be specific,at which time dad agrees to go along with it.<br />The rendezvous is made and in walks Joe.Joe explains with a calm demeanour and in simple terms,the rules of the contract.And oh yes,his fee is $25,000,not $20,000*gulp*.The two agree to Joe's terms but Chris tells him they have no fee,in advance.They want to wait until the cheque comes in,so to speak,in order to pay him.Joe is having none of this and starts to walk out,when he thinks of an idea.He has seen Chris's younger sister and has taken a shine to her.He will take her as a retainer in lieu of payment,until the cheque clears.<br />Chris has been weaving and dodging his creditor,Digger,all over town.His boys eventually catch up to him and Digger and he catch up on the local goings on,with Chris apologizing for not being able to make Diggers party the past month.Digger says he really likes Chris but his boys are going to have to do a number on him anyways.And if the money is not paid within two days,he will be officially six feet under.Chris comes home,bleeding profusely,to a real cozy homestead with Joe living temporarily with the Smith clan.Chris is getting antsy about his sister's relationship with Joe and he asks him to call off the hit.Joe shows Chris the trunk of his car,which reveals he has already done the deed.Chris is forced to drive with Joe to a remote location and put the body into another vehicle,which Joe promptly torches,to hide any evidence of foul play.<br />The next day Mr and Mrs Smith are at the lawyers office to talk about his ex's will.Chris and Dottie are waiting for them when they come out and the news isn't good at all.It seems the will isn't payable to Dottie but to Rex.Joe smells something rotten.With a little snooping and a little \\"pressure\\" put on Rex,Joe confronts Ansell and Sharla at the dinner table after their return from the funeral.Joe's eyes and words are all aimed at Sharla.He asks her about the insurance money.Then he goes onto some nude pictures he \\"obtained\\" of and from Rex;the case from which they came out from,we had seen earlier in Sharla's possession.There are some extremely tense moments as Joe gets quite violent with Sharla and all Ansell can do is watch,horrified.It seems Sharla has been having an on going affair with Rex for sometime and that the insurance money was for $100,000,not $50,0000! It was all a scam on Rex and Sharla's parts to get the money for themselves.<br />Chris meanwhile arrives home and things quickly turn sour as Chris tells Joe to leave his sister alone.Faster than you can say \\"chitlins\\",the two are wrestling on the floor.Unbeknownst to the rest,Dottie gets the gun Chris had pointed at Joe.Joe has announced he and Dottie are to be married,while Chris says that she is coming away with him.Dottie gets up to leave and both are after her attention,when she spins around and shoots Chris.She then shoots her father and points it at Joe.It is then she reveals she is pregnant.Joe's face beams as he asks Dottie to put the gun down.Just as her finger moves back to the trigger,the film cuts to black.<br />Will she shoot,or won't she?It was a great spot to leave it.Matthew McConaughey absolutely nailed his part as the cowboy hat wearing Dallas cop,with his ultra calm demeanour and affectations.Thomas Church also really nailed his character as the man-child/father of the Smith clan.Each and every other actor were totally into their parts and brought their characters individual idiosyncrasies to vivid life.There was nothing that wasn't believable about these people.The film had some extremely intense and sexually oriented moments though.Everything up to the confrontation scene near the end,I bought and had little problem with.The part where Joe is forcing Sharla to \\"swallow\\" a drumstick I thought was just over the top and unnecessary.That is my only criticism of the film.When it wasn't intense it could tug on the heart strings,especially when we learn of Dottie's background.Then at other times the film had a good sense of humour,such as the straight up funny moment when Sharla picks a thread off of Ansell's suit shoulder,and the arm falls down.This is American Gothic on steroids!<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.<br />All in all a wonderful film about dysfunctionality in the south,set amongst a murder with a twist.McConaughey is fabulous in his part,and the rest of the cast rise to the occasion also,bringing their characters to life.Warning some scenes can be sexually graphic and are not for anyone under their late teens.Recommended.ells Joe to leave his sister alone.Faster than you can say \\"chitlins\\",the two are wrestling on the floor.Unbeknownst to the rest,Dottie gets the gun Chris had pointed at Joe.Joe has announced he and Dottie are to be married,while Chris says that she is coming away with him.Dottie gets up to leave and both are after her attention,when she spins around and shoots Chris.She then shoots her father and points it at Joe.It is then she reveals she is pregnant.Joe's face beams as he asks Dottie to put the gun down.Just as her finger moves back to the trigger,the film cuts to black.<br />Will she shoot,or won't she?It was a great spot to leave it.Matthew McConaughey absolutely nailed his part as the cowboy hat wearing Dallas cop,with his ultra calm demeanour and affectations.Thomas Church also really nailed his character as the man-child/father of the Smith clan.Each and every other actor were totally into their parts and brought their characters individual idiosyncrasies to vivid life.There was nothing that wasn't believable about these people.The film had some extremely intense and sexually oriented moments though.Everything up to the confrontation scene near the end,I bought and had little problem with.The part where Joe is forcing Sharla to \\"swallow\\" a drumstick I thought was just over the top and unnecessary.That is my only criticism of the film.When it wasn't intense it could tug on the heart strings,especially when we learn of Dottie's background.Then at other times the film had a good sense of humour,such as the straight up funny moment when Sharla picks a thread off of Ansell's suit shoulder,and the arm falls down.This is American Gothic on steroids!<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.<br />All in all a wonderful film about dysfunctionality in the south,set amongst a murder with a twist.McConaughey is fabulous in his part,and the rest of the cast rise to the occasion also,bringing their characters to life.Warning some scenes can be sexually graphic and are not for anyone under their late teens.Recommended.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Book was an awesome romantic and sexy.definitely a must-read.better then what I expected for being a free book so dive in.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The item was just as advertised.  It arrived very fast. The item was packaged securely. I started watching it immediately!
0765325950|5.0|The Wheel of Time series was building up to this for over 20 years, and it doesn't disappoint.  It's like a huge action movie in book form, with most things nicely wrapped up, some things not, and leaving me with the need to read it again immediately.  Highly recommended
B001IYVUEW|5.0|I love all of the batman movies. I didn't want to watch this one at first because it didn't seem to fit with the batman stories, but I finally broke down and watched it. Twice. I loved it!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Invest your money in this movie, you won't regret it if you wanna laugh and see young talented girls and boys. I love it. Happy to see it !!
B00B3EVNEE|5.0|This album is sooo good.  Little Red Rooster - OH YEAH and that is just one song. Already listened to the album twice today, it is that good.
B002BBJ52U|5.0|Ladies, this is a great choice. It's a fun movie. Watch it !! I have seen it so many times.
B002SJKWZ4|4.0|I never use this because it was a gift for someone, but they were very e xcited by the idea of it and seem to be happy with its performance.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|People come to me asking what headphones they should buy. I have never had a doubt on what to answer.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This was a perfect gift for my grown son for Christmas. The set was a quality product, included extras that I did not expect, all in a nice little package.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I missed several episodes of season 1 when it was on TV (no DVR yet), so I was so happy to get caught up on what I missed.  The series takes a new twist on all your favorite fairytales and mixes them together into a story you can't stop watching.  I recieved the DVD quickly and in perfect shape.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves fairytales and has a good imagination.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was the best one ever. I want you to make more Diary of a wimpy kid books that are longer and a little more interesting!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was such a good read. Not only was it a story of love, but it went into so much more. Unexpected twists and stories that let us really know the characters. I would recommend it 1000 times over. So glad I stumbled across it.
B003VR5PPY|2.0|I picked up this game because there is a core of really vocal people who trumpet it as one of the most amazing games ever made.<br /><br />I just don't see it.<br /><br />First, there is very little gameplay.  Proably 90-95% of the game is story.  And the text is painfully slow.  Which, I suppose, wouldn't be too bad if it was great writing.  It is not.<br /><br />It is written at what I would estimate is a grade three level.  The vocabulary, sentence structure, plot, characters etc are all very very basic.  There is also a slight tinge of racism in the game, so be forewarned if you are sensitive to that.  In terms of quality of story, I would equate it to a decent manga, nothing more.<br /><br />The small amount of gameplay has point and click adventure elements, and some puzzle solving.  But it is so sparse, that I cannot give the game more than 2 stars.<br /><br />Before purchasing, watch some youtube gameplay videos first to see what you are getting into.  Don't rely on over-the-top hyperbole from the hard core fans.
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|Just a little disappointed when it's not EU edition as picture show. All songs are as best as Celine's songs were. Worth a long awaiting.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Great series.  Claire Danes is fantastic and the plot is good, although I think the writers will need to be more flexible for the next season.
B00AB55BS0|4.0|I love this series. But the package design is quite poor especially paper quality which thin and easy to reshape. DVD holder is useless, it comes with hard paper sleeve and 2 sides DVD. It makes DVD scratched on both side.
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|It doesn't do the book justice.  There is no chemistry between the actors.  Her childhood took too long.  There wasn't enough time spent on the developing the relationship between Rochestor and Jane.  It was way too rushed in the middle and too much time was spent on things that didn't matter.  The dialog sucked.  Do yourself a favor and watch the Youtube clips availbe.  You will save yourself the cost of the movie.  Also Rochester can't act.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|NOT able to watch flash on your fire? With this software on your PC and your Fire and you now have a wireless monitor. Take your computer into any where your WiFi will reach. Power hungry but awesome tool.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|Good movie.  decent acting.  fun watch for those that like car racing.  complete fluff.  I'm not a huge fan of the cartoon series but I was impressed.  If you don't enjoy bright vivid colors like neon yellow stay away.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Enjoyed this movie. I had never seen it before. Tommy Lee Jones has always been a favorite of mine. Lots of twists and turns in the story line. Would recommend this to anyone!
045122499X|5.0|I could not put the book down and I recommend it to everyone.  I have been trying to get the movie but unfortunately they do not have captions, because I do not hear very well
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Wonderful and magical--and the best way to see season one of your favorite fairytale land show. It is quite Charming, Dearies!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great fun, challenging puzzles, and interesting story. Runs perfectly on Kindle Fire, zoom in for hidden objects, casual or expert play options, and good graphics. One of the few I'll play again and again.  Highly recommend this one!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|An amazing app, works wonderfuly! I dont know what I would do without this app! Five stars from me :)
B007HACDLK|4.0|It had been a while since I truly enjoyed reading something worthwhile.  Story will keep you awake and interested.  Thumbs up
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. I never get bored playing it. When I first started playing it I thought it was a little kids game but it grew on me. Definitely worth being free!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Buy it if you like angry birds. This is one of the better versions of the game series. New physics, levels, etc. Im just not fond of the new updates...
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addicting. I can't stop playing and now my kindle battery is low lol. this is great!
B00884GR0W|5.0|I own minecraft  pocket edition, survival craft (which is much better than mine craft) and recently purchased this title. After playing for awhile, I've come to the conclusion that this game is awesome, and well worth owning.<br /><br />I have an Asus Nexus 7, booted the game at full settings as well as distance sliders to max, and the game runs like a dream. Everything looks really nice, moves really well, and has no slowdown. I love the texturing of the objects, as well as all of the extra filtering settings. This game is really well made!<br /><br />The story mode is awesome and character leveling and progression is fantastic; its almost like minecraft met elder scrolls. Enemies, creatures, etc are abundant and the exploration of the game is always fun, minecraft, survival craft, all sort of make you feel like you're on earth with some weird twists. Block story however feels like an off world experience, and it does this well,<br /><br />Combat is awesome, magic is well worth the purchase alone. I have to say guns and bullets are a nice touch, albeit not really needed as bows are available...but shooting a goblin or a cow in the face is kind of fun!<br /><br />The only cons I have with the game are that I dislike the fact that there isn't anuseage limit to tools before they \\"break\\". This game generates 30 pickaxes or what have you, and each pick breaks per block used. 30 picks mine 30 blocks. I'd rather have one pick that breaks after uses, but I suppose it is mute in the end as it comes to the same result.<br /><br />Love you guys that made this title. I hope to see more updates and can't wait for TNT! Good work!
B000SEI230|5.0|This book was beautiful! Much better than the movie, such an amazing story. Very sad, I had chill bumps and tears while reading the last 10 pages. I would totally recommend this to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun that my granddaughter plays it all the time. I don't get this game neither does my husband.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|FIRST of all Kristen Stewart should stick to her ridiculous Twilight crap.<br /><br />I would have rated 0 stars but it's not an option.<br /><br />Totally disappointing and I would like a refund of my $3.99 rental fee.<br /><br />Stupid @$$ movie...... I'd rather free my backyard of canine waste than watch this feces again.<br /><br />Dumb effin chick flick.... enjoy broads.
B003UYUP58|4.0|This is a well-written, fascinating book about the pharmaceutical industry. Siddartha Mukherjee does an excellent job. I thoroughly an enjoying this book.
1401923127|5.0|Have not had a chance to read this book yet, but I love this author and appreciate his awareness. Listen to him on you tube often.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|There are times when it takes awhile to get into Banks` books but this one rolls from the beginning. The Why mystery is cleared up immediately but what effect all these details will have is not clear until the end.<br />Basically a detective thriller.  One thing that I would recommend would be to make a list of the abreviations for ship types.  There are an awful lot of them in here!
1878424319|5.0|this is a good book if you want to be awakened. I have gotten one for all of my children. And would recommend it for anyone. Teaches good principles.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Nice tie up of storyline in this one.  Not spectacular, but solid if you like the MIB series.  Enjoy from your couch :)
B00A8LRIEW|2.0|Well, here goes... I've been a fan since first hearing Unknown Pleasures in 1981...<br /><br />Musically this is very good, however the lyrics are just plain bad. This is how I feel about the majority of stuff they've released under the \\"New Order\\" name from Republic onwards (some of their solo projects were FAR superior to the stuff they released as New Order). For this release - the leftovers from 2005 -  it's nice to hear them, but there's not even one take-away track for me. Well, maybe one: the different version of I Told You So. The rest are (again, as the majority of their stuff from Republic onwards) embarassingly bad - due to the poor lyrics and wimpy delivery of them... Too bad Hooky never got the chance to have more input with the lyrics and singing - maybe then their songs wouldn't sound like they're coming from some whiney twit in high school.
B00B0NDF26|4.0|The entire CD is awesome. I am a fan of their work...listening to it the first time it wasn't what I was expecting. Upon listening to it a second time I was already singing along to the chorus of some of the songs and I was quickly identifying my favorite tracks (1,4,5,6 and 7). The songs are are catchy and most choruses will hook you (and not leave your head)! Tegan and Sara's HEART THROB definitely gets my recommendation.
B00881VLCE|5.0|lots of fun and free pics to choose from. I can spend hours playing with this app. I love that most of it is free.
0385535147|3.0|The Racketeer is supposed to be a legal thriller. The funniest part about it is that there's nothing thrilling. I have written detailed review at following link! :)  [...]
B003O86FMW|5.0|The hunger games was good. But this book left my heart racing, my nails bitten & work buy neglected until it was finished.  So very good!
B0000696ID|5.0|Item arrived on time and in good shape.  Packaged well.  We have watched it a number of times without problem.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I love the durability of this case.  It protected my kindle when I dropped it once. I love the way it opens and the kindle can  sit on the non- slip surface the case offers. I attach my stylus to the strap outside for storage when not in use.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Has been a while since I read a Reacher book, but this one reminded my why Lee Child is a great action writer.  Try it you'll like it.
B009C7JS14|4.0|The pictures are very beautiful. I use it in the morning before going to work to check the weather for the day when I can't get immediate weather forecast on TV.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I haven't had this much FUN reading a book in a year or two. Sloan's voice is exactly how I narrate my world.<br /><br />Interestingly, my Dad (who is a sixty-something bookseller) and I (who am a thirty-something technophile) both adored the book, and found a lot to share as we read it.<br /><br />Looking forward to more from this author.
0062197266|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it had a few turns and twist that I didn't expect. I will be looking for more by this author. Elizabeth Haynes did well on this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was one of the fastest books I ever read. I had a hard time putting it down.  A real page turner.
0670023329|3.0|this was a gift for my son, who heard about it on the news. I am glad I live in Americia
B009B8YZIK|5.0|I'm a big halo fan. And considering the budget I think they did a fantastic job at showing a prequel to the halo 4 game as well as a stand alone little film. If you're a fan of the games you will love this film.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Be careful, you can become addicted to Dexter. :) I saw the whole season in 3 maybe for days. I liked it the best!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Haven't time to watch it all yet. The 3 DVDs I have watched I  have enjoyed. They arrived as was promised.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Got this game just cause I had restaurant story(also a five star game) and I was surprised. The graphics sometimes get messed up, but that was a little thing. Overall this is still a great game.
141659521X|5.0|Another excellent book by Vince Flynn!<br />I enjoyed every page & couldn't put it down!<br />Looking for more Vince Flynn books.<br />I think however, I've read them all!<br />So, I'll eagerly await the next one!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|for a few days I have had stress pressing down on my shoulder's, but when I started to play this game it took the stress right out of me and filled me with joy. Thanks for the game dev(s)!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It takes too long to get gems. I get bored. I would like to see different games as I level up.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This is a must have for any Nexus 10 owner.  Don't get me wrong, I love the option to use the micro USB and am really glad Samsung included it for the convenience, but I got this for the reasons listed below.<br /><br />Reasons for getting:<br />- Protects the Nexus 10 from tripping on the cable (I have little kids running around, and this is essential).<br />- Easily plugs into Nexus 10 in the dark and light (my wife goes to bed before me and now she can't get mad at me for turning on the light to plug in the usb charger).<br />- Saves the USB port from wear and tear over time.<br /><br />Perks:<br />- Charges a little faster (which is a very nice perk indeed, since I mainly got this for the reasons above).<br />- Fits perfectly.  I love sliding the connector around the bottom and then feel and hear the click as the magnets pull it into place (either I got lucky, or the reviewers who say the charger doesn't fit are putting it in upside down).<br />- Quality (this looks like the authentic cable meant for the Nexus 10).<br />- Shipping was super fast.<br /><br />Easily worth the $$ if your circumstances are the same as mine.  Easily worth it even if they're not.  Hope this helps people who are deciding if they want to get it or not.
0780626966|5.0|I got this box set to upgrade my vhs box set that came out at the same time as this box set several years ago. If your a freddy fan your going to love it. Comes with the nightmare encyclopedia which ppl love i havent seen it yet though.all in all great box set ill be picking up the blue ray one soon.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Easy to use...I actually expected less than,but it turned out to be more....I use it all the time for work,and notes.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app has a great variety of games from puzzles to strategy and various levels of difficulty are encompassed within the game.
B007LNJ4YW|5.0|Formed in 2004 the indie dream pop duo Beach House consists of Victoria Legrand & Alex Scally (they're from Baltimore, Maryland). 'Bloom' is their 4th album with debut 'Beach House' (2006), 'Devotion' (2008) & 'Teen Dream' (2010). After initial listens then, even if not completely exciting, all tracks are of a really high quality with no duds. Opening 'Myth' with emotion being generated via exciting instrumentation nuances & the gentle husky vocal from Victoria sets the tone. 'Wild' continues the magic as it majestically propels the listening mood onwards. Then 'Lazuli' with its fantastic intro carries us to epic proportions. Virtually impossible to choose the best amongst this triumvirate but I'd chose 'Lazuli' especially when it moves into \\"like no other you can't be replaced\\". 'Other People', 'The Hours', 'Troublemaker', 'New Year' (really beautiful), 'Wishes' (another gem which grows with each listen) continues this hypnotic effect. 9th track 'On The Sea' with its plodding beautiful piano chords is another sublime & brilliant piece equal to any of the opening trio. \\"Shadows bend & suddenly the world becomes and swallows me in\\" \\"whistle to a friend gentle to the end\\". The most emotional here. If that wasn't enough then every time I hear final track 'Irene' \\"it's a strange paradise\\" than am moved to play the guitar as it is just so inspirational with that guitar strum on repetition. After a long period of silence there is a hidden track. One small point is that to read the lyrics in the accompanying CD booklet I needed to find a magnifying glass ;-) OK there is a slight lack of energy & excitement & Victoria doesn't have the strongest voice but they know all about beauty & melody with the end result being a supreme beautiful dream pop fuelled melodic excursion. Blonde Redhead's 2010 album 'Penny Sparkle' set the high standard for beautiful dream pop but this in its own way is almost the equal of that. Perhaps best track is 'Lazuli' and have this also on a Record Store Day limited 7\\" lazuli coloured vinyl. Almost the album of 2012 (2nd) but that accolade by a smidgeon goes to Cameras 'In Your Room' (1st) with then Gemma Ray 'Island Fire' (3rd) & Dog Is Dead 'All Our Favourite Stories' (4th) also closely there.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I wanted to have a place that I could easily find different versions of the bible. This was an application that ran all the time and was annoying.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great story, characters and acting. You have to love Maggie Smith!  Can't wait to purchase Season 3!  You won't be disappointed.
0761169253|5.0|Love this book.  Love, love, love it!!!  Funny, confrontive, inspiring, smart.  Love it.  The thoughts in here will cause you to view all aspects of your life in a new, expanded way.  Read it!
0891419195|5.0|One of, if not THE classic, of the WWII pacific island campaign. Very personal first hand account of Marine combat in the<br />bloody island offensive.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2!Better than regular temple run. So exciting!BEST GAME EVER!!!! I love it so chalanging.wonderful cool wwwwwwwwoooooooooowwwwww
B00797MB0O|1.0|When bad things happen to good actors. Don't waste your time. You have to care at least a LITTLE about the main character and this one won't make that happen. Watched the whole thing waiting for it to improve but it fished as badly as it started.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Love the variety of sounds.  Hate that I apparently have to rate before I can turn sound off right now to go to a game on my K Fire.
0375869026|5.0|Loved the story and the way it was written.  Seeing the story from different perspectives made it more interesting.  Wonderful for my 5th grader to read.  She also loved the book and read it in a few days.  Great for middle schoolers and adults too.  A valuable read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow! Couldn't tear my  eyes away. Can't wait to try some of the scenes with my better half. Awesome does not cover the description of this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great book. So many twists and turns. Could only read a few pages at a time as it was so stressful, but fun!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|A great movie and ending to the trilogy.  A good movie on its own but to get the full effect you should watch the first two movies.  Extra features are nice but nothing spectacular.  They advertised an IPad app that you are supposed to sync over the network to your blu-ray player but I could not get it to work.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game, the only problem I have is that I can't stop playing. I recommend it to everyone!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you have any Bible apps, this should be the ONE! It's easy to use and has so much variety to choose from in translations. Love the reading plans, too. I can't sing enough praises about this product!!!!
B005R32L66|3.0|Skype is a great app for people to chat through a webcam for surely. The only problem I have with it is that video is lost some times and they could improve the graphics  (unless that's the other persons camera) but Skype is way better than Face time. I gave Skype 3 stars because of how good video calls are and plus they added a lot of stuff that isn't needed. I have been using Skype for quite awhile. This app is great for people who aren't to picky with their video calls but is still a pretty great app.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|When I first read the summary of this book I was skeptical. My mind kept going on and on about how boring a book it would be. But I forced myself to read it, scratch that. I was practically destroying my iPhone screen digging for more. As I dove in the story with its multiple points of view and vivid description and quotes, I can't begin to explain how happy and how much it made me realize how cruel society is. But the whole point is that people change, for the better. As J.R. Palacio said, &#34;There are more good people than bad people in the world.&#34;

B005PK56TA|5.0|This show keeps you guessing until the end of the series!! I am not joking when I day every adult in my family loves this show. Me and my husband caught it after it aired and watched it. The best thing is you don't have to see the first season to watch the second season, and did I mention it is free on Amazon prime!!!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This is a fun game, especialy for the price. The dialouge is stilted, but it's got its own charm. Story matches the tasks you are asks to accomplish.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|This is a fun little game, but be careful that you don't ever hit the back or home buttons on your device or you will completely lose your game and have to start a new one. It's very easy to make this mistake as the game only opens in landscape mode so your hands are close to the basic device buttons most of the time. There also doesn't seem to be any listing of your previous scores besides the notification at the end that you have a new high score (there is a menu option titled &quot;leaderboard&quot; but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to do anything).
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This app is a price of crap and is a wAlaste of ur time I suggest you would never get this app ever!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book definitely was a page turner!  I could not put it down because there are so many surprising twists and turns.  I was very unhappy with the way the book ends, though.  I wish it ended differently, but it was yet another surprising twist.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Cool game with fun puzzles. Story reminds me of Bioshock. Collectors edition might be worth a buy for some people.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. I loved that the intimate parts were not subtle and I really felt the characters.  A great twist.
B008HK3XYK|2.0|I thought this would be like the leather case I had for my original Kindle, but it was of a lesser quality, and I found it  awkward to use for reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book on my kindle and liked being able to look up the names of characters in the beginning to help me follow the story.  Very suspenseful and entertaining.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|Arrived in perfect condition plays great this is a very good Cd and I'm glad I bbought it its rock n roll music
0451532082|4.0|I first read this story via Kindle (you can get the Kindle app for computers and most classics for free here on Amazon). I fell in love with the story and wanted to get my own physical copy. I was looking for an inexpensive edition that contained both \\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives,\\" which completes the story of the March girls' growth from girlhood to marriage. This edition fit the bill! The print is a little small, but it's such a long story that I suppose it would be a gigantic book if the print were much larger. I'm happy with it.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|My soon to be 7yr old daughter LOVES this game.  It is her favorite Kindle game so far.  She has been playing it for a couple of months now and still hasn't gotten tired of it yet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so good I read it in like 4 hours. I figured out sky had been raped by her father early on but the other twist was a shocker to me. This book had me laughing crying and say a few curse words. The only negative to it to me was I feel like there was some unanswered questions about holder but the other than that it was Turkey a heart wrenching believable story. I would definitely recommend this book.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I really like this game.  The colors are bright and the &#34;twisting&#34; of the cube makes it very interesting and fun.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Don't know what to say except that she is amazing!  Had heard a few tracks on the radio that I really liked - but love all of the songs.

B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love this game,  and the pictures are so pretty. I like how you can change how the picture looks,  from paper to wood etc.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I love tune in alloes you to listen to music around the world from A to Z.  Suggestion for programing. I have tune in free and then bought pro.  Would be nice ti take favorites from free and sync with pro.  This was a bit annoying to have to redo favorites.  Or give an option to update and overwrite the free taking favs and putting them on pro.  Tune in does not save to sd.card.  good app love car mode can see without glasses and able to switch while driving.  Favs could be a bit bigger for older genetation.  Great job.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|A double shot of greatness with the cd plus the dvd of this wonderful rejoining of these two great artists. What makes this such a special concert is that the focus is on the begining of their careers together. Before Carol became a solo artist she was James' piano player appearing on his first couple of albums. They sound as if no time has passed since they both sound as good as they ever have. It goes without saying that the songs ate all wonderful and for those of us who remember these the first time around it is a wonderful musical walk down memories lane. This is must for any fan of thrse two. It is great to not only her it but to see it as well.
B000EQ5SRK|3.0|nice to have a method of getting old classics that have not been released on dvd.  Does not come on TV

B009HELT3C|3.0|Not as good as the first two but still an enjoyable movie.<br />I would watch it twice though I  thought  this film was not as funny as<br />the first two and didn't live up to my expectations.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|This should be made into a Valentine movie on Hallmark channel it was so good and entertaining and I could see this done.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I gave this a definite 5 star.  It was the perfect book.  Very cute story.  I will read this again because I couldn't' t put it down.<br />Melissa Zieger
B008ULRY78|5.0|What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? It has quite possibly the MOST gore and violence that I have ever seen packed into ONE movie! The way it was filmed was also very original. There are a few tense, suspenseful scenes but that usually means it will soon EXPLODE into chaos, fast, crazy camera work and extreme violence, shooting, killing, fighting and explosions.<br /><br />For those of you who want some long, detailed plot explanation there really isn't one. What you read in the description and see in the trailers is basically what you get but with a lot more blood. It's a raid. Things get ugly and tons of people die in really crazy, gory ways. It had a great ending though it was a pretty typical one for an Asian martial arts film. It does have subtitles but even without them it's NOT hard to figure out what is going on. This is a movie about what happens when the you-know-what hits the fan...people fight, people die and people do very bad things...the end!<br /><br />So it wasn't the best quality movie ever...It didn't have the best budget and it doesn't have any well-known actors with their shirts off...BUT it did have pretty good intensity and realism from the actors which is rare in an action movie. It had insane martial arts moves. It also had really violent, clever and gory scenes filmed in ways that have not been done before and it scores major uniqueness points for all the crazy death scenes.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie was that my boyfriend LOVED it! It's probably not a good \\"date movie\\" but then again, it depends on who your date is. There are those ladies out there (ME!) who like a good action movie too. If you are offended by extreme violence this probably isn't the movie for you. If you happen to enjoy non-stop action, fighting, shooting, blood and a high death-toll in a film, then this movie will deliver all that and more. I have to say it is probably the most violent movie I have ever seen. There was never adull moment and I give it five stars for being SO freaking insane!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|my friend recommended i read this book. i started it earlier today and i couldn't put it down<br />the best!!!
0810993139|5.0|Bought this book as a gift for my cousin thought this would be a great collection for him to start off
B007HC3LHS|4.0|One of these days I'm sure I'll hit a klinker, but so far I've had great luck with free (and nearly free) books from sites like Lendle, BookBub and Freebooksifter. Of course, I check the ratings first (if there are fewer than 25 and they're almost all 5s, I usually pass - friends and family easily can account for that many). This book, however, had nearly 270 ratings of 5 and 4 (mostly 5), so I figured it would be worth the $1.99 price.<br /><br />Happily, I was right. The story centers on Catherine Bailey, who after a life filled with after-work parties, fun and games finds a guy who's a bit mysterious, but nearly perfect - as all her friends agree. But then, a darker side emerges, ending with two incarcerations: His, in prison, and hers, locked in a new world of OCD and PTSD as a result of his mental and physical torture.<br /><br />That new world isn't pleasant, but Cathy is managing to deal with it until - you guessed it - her former lover is released from jail. Now, she's frantic with worry about how long, and when and where, he'll find her again - as well trying to get comfortable with her feelings for a new love with whom she's just begun to find happiness once again.<br /><br />If you've seen the 1991 psychological thriller &#34;Sleeping With the Enemy&#34; starring Julia Roberts, you'll get this one right away; the setting is different (London instead of Cape Cod and Cedar Falls, Iowa), but the theme is strikingly similar. Chapters in the book flip-flop from snippets of her horrific past to the present as she tries to maintain what sanity she has left before the inevitable happens and she's face-to-face with the person she's certain will find her. Quite honestly, that's a technique that's being used by authors so often these days that it's becoming a bit tiring, but in this case, it works.<br /><br />Maybe I've read too many of these &#34;head games&#34; books, but I admit to having back-of-my-mind thoughts that this one wouldn't turn out in the expected way. Would her new psychologist boyfriend, for instance, end up being just as terrible as the other one? Is it possible she's reliving the whole thing from her locked-down room in a psychiatric ward rather than the real world? In other words, was I, the reader, being played as well?<br /><br />Of course, I'll never tell (not here, at least). Suffice it to say this one moved right along and was hard to put down.y.

0810994739|5.0|I got these great books for my little cousin who just love watching the Wimpy Kid, I thought this would be a great start
B005LAII08|5.0|I got this during a Christmas sale and so the package was a great value. The movie is great and having the digital copy along with the blue rays and DVD is awesome.<br /><br />One negative is that the bonus feature blue ray disc seemed cobbled together. All the good extras are on the main disc. The extra feature disc was lame and unnecessary. It isn't why I bought the pack but it seemed like they just wanted to say they had X number of discs.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Wonderful, feel good movie with a surprising cast. Not my favorite Robin Williams character but, well played. The music is easy to listen to. This is one I will watch over and over.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this book. The plot is original and unpredictable with believable, sympathetic characters. I purchased the first five books all together for my Kindle and could barely put them down. From the moment I was dropped into the post-apocalyptic world of the Silo, I was fully absorbed by the characters, their motivations, and the secrets that the Silo held. Although post-apocalyptic books such as this can often be overly dark, I did not find this one to be so. It is suspenseful and eerie but beneath all of that runs a vein of hope and faith in mankind and the future. Even the \\"bad guys\\" in this series are not as deeply flawed as I initially thought, at least not after I got to know them a bit more.<br /><br />I am a high school English teacher and have already recommended this series to many of my students who are avid readers. I would recommend it to anyone and not only can I not wait to purchase book 6 in this series, I am also looking forward to reading more works by Hugh Howey.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|One of DeMille's best. Left some things hanging at the end, but I hope that means a follow up book. Great read!
0307474712|3.0|I am into romantic happy endings so this book was a little dark for me. The main characters and very different but sways making the wrong choices.  If you are looking for a classic happy ending romance stay away from this... It's more glass half empty I suppose. More real life.
B00B2EWNWG|2.0|There were a few clever moments in this, but the picture overall was a bit of a disjointed mess.<br /><br />I was not aware that it was going to be a hip-hop fighting show, which could have been interestingly stylized (Last Dragon, Samurai Champloo, Black Dynamite, etc.), but such was not the case. I love kung fu films, so was disappointed there were only a couple scenes that really had notable choreography (the yin-yang fight and Lucy Liu were cool). It felt like they kept picking facets of the project to focus on that ultimately did nothing to contribute to the film as a whole, such as story points that didn't matter, character development for someone that didn't motivate the story, etc. I could have forgiven even that if there had been more kung fu in the movie!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best book in the fifty trilogy! I love this because it get past the sex and gets really deep into each character. Don't worry it also has all the steamy scenes too!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it....Love It....need to right 17 more words.  Twelve more. I really, really liked it. Five more. Almost done. There.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There is a reason why these books are so popular! This is a fast read with a adventure and while different look on where our country's future is going.<br /><br />It's a must read!
B005DZMP00|4.0|The song selection is great, esp. for those who don't have the time and/or money to wade through the entire Europe '72 tour (all avail. now on CD).  The Dark Star/Other One jam on disk 2 is triptastic... I don't really care for \\"Sing Me Back Home\\" (too slow, too long) but hey, that's just me...<br /><br />The vocals are not as pristine sounding as on the original Europe '72 album, since those were mostly overdubbed in the studio.  But that's a minor complaint.  For the price it's a great deal.
B004ZY0VHY|1.0|We chose to read this book in my book club so I tried to read it. I was disgusted with the whole story line. The Connecticut shootings Happened around this time and I had to stop reading because I was so discussed. I do not want to sympathize with a sadistic murder.

Only thing is; either my Kindle has unread Reacher books or my bookshelf holds unread Reacher books.  When I get through all I will have to make a list of which I liked best down to least.  Get this one you will love it.

B008MM9630|5.0|I've become so addicted to this game! Great game play, fun quests and adorable graphics. I do wish the were more opportunities to acquire crystals as some quests require items that can only be bought with crystals, but overall this doesn't hinder play. Can't wait for the next update!!
B004LWZWGK|1.0|How did this bloated , predictable,badly written, tripe ever make it to the theaters? Like many of you I had to watch it to finish the series. If you are expecting more of what we got when Heath ledger was the Joker, forget it. Chris Bale looks like a skinny Don Knotts through the whole thing, no wonder he cannot fight off a little old granny not to mention this sorry and unimaginative 'super villain' Bane. If you have half a brain you will know  the whole movie within the first 15 mins. All the military presence and propaganda is enough to make any Call of Doody fan happy though I suppose.These scnees of explosions were long and boring, there were a host of characters that were introuduced and promptly forgotten because their card board acting and yes I am speaking of the even the main people....No likable characters and only one good line in the whole thing imo \\"Maybe your knife was too slow\\".
B001ANSSDC|4.0|When I first started this book I didn't think I would enjoy it.  While the subject matter wasn't extremely happy the book wasn't depressing

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I did not start reading this series until book four was finished.  This one was as great as the first.  I can not wait until the next one is published.  I hope I don't have too long to wait, otherwise I may have to reread the 1st four again.<br />The  Game of Throne ought to be included in high school or college literature classes.
0007447868|5.0|More, please! My only criticism is that I want to know what's going on with Dany, Tyrion, etc. But, the author assures us that we'll get all the news in the next book... can't wait.
055358202X|5.0|I love this whole series.  The story is very detailed.  The characters all have their on chapters with plot lines that are separate from  and intersected with each other.  I am not always happy with a turn the plot takes, but I am always intrigued.

B004LWZW7O|5.0|This was a very fast paced and entertaining movie.  Justin Timberlake is very good as is Amanda Seyfreid.  As crazy as the world is getting, I didn't find it that far fetched.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|I may continue to read this book someday but it had so many things in it that I did not want to believe people did during the war that I had to stop reading. A very different book.
1564148793|5.0|First time reading this book and I totally learned a lot from it. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to protect themselves and their home.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I love haunted movies and ghosts and spirits. I don't think I can sleep without my bathroom light on. I'm 58 years young but this movie puts my heart in my mouth.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it!! This is the third book I've read from this author and I can't wait to read more from her. I definitely recommend!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Just when you purchase the very last building or pony the game automatically starts over. Explain that to a heartbroken 4 yr old. Not a good game for little ones when all is gone. Gameloft should be ashamed of themselves. At first I thought we did something wrong. when all 3 of my kindles did the same thing I knew it wasn't us. Amazon and kindle you need to be more careful in kid games choices.
B00992CF6W|5.0|There is a survival mode and a creative mode. In survival, there is skeletons, zombies, and creepers. ( creeper is a green monster with 4 legs and no arms)you can make weapons to fight them well, you make most of the things with a crafting table. You can make a house, too. Or maybe even 2 or 3 and so on. You can make houses with building materials like cobblestone, wood planks, stone, and gravel. U can also restore your hearts by killing animals and collecting its meat or making a recipe. Now in creative mode there is no monsters. You have all the supplies. Well, there is no animals either and u don't have lives. You have unlimited supplies. Oh ya, forgot to tell you in survival mode if you mix lava and water, you create cobblestone.<br /><br />This is a fun, fun, game. I recommended it to all.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great bag. It accomodates all of my &#34;stuff&#34; - camera, 3 lenses, flash, camcorder, chargers, extra batteries, etc. Compartments are great - a place for everything and everything in its place. I've tried and used many different bags - this is the best - especially for the price.
1439153663|2.0|Predictable southern slavery novel of the cruel plantation owner, his suffering deceived wife and the oppressed slaves who work on the plantation. If you like soap operas you'll like this tiresome read.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|It's awesome. News, social media, customized menus. This app has everything, like a browser for today's world. Get it. Yeah.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a really extrodanary game. The grafics are really good for a game. People who love horses should really download My Horse.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I stopped eating fast food after viewing this documentary and lost 15 pounds in 6 weeks without doing anything else. We are what we eat!
B0049IHX2C|5.0|I bought all three of the men in black movies.  We enjoyed every one of them.  They are funny and great entertainment.
B0024FAR5M|1.0|I chose this rating only because I feel like I was lied to. This dvd was not season one, but three episodes from season one. The disc was received in a timely manner and in great condition it just wasn't what I sent for. The ad reads &#34;Sons of Anarchy: Season One&#34;, I didn't get season One.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|exxeExcellent read. Anxioiusly waiting for the next ublication. Start these books, don't come up for air until the last page.
B007L6VR12|5.0|One of those little sleeper movies that never got attention.  Bruce Willis is amazing as an old man but the kids really steal the show and we laughed all the way through.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little sharpener is very easy to use with better than average results.  I have not achieved a shaving quality edge from this device, but it gets close.<br /><br />I have sharpened my Bowie, Kukri, fillet, and folder with this gadget and have been very happy with the results.  As with most sharpeners, the results are largely based on the accurate use and angle.<br /><br />Unless you are reprofiling an edge, don't use too much pressure.  Be certain that your blade is bilaterally at a 90 degree angle to the sharpener.  When using the diamond rod on serrations, the angle of your stroke can perfect or destroy the knife serrations.<br /><br />If used correctly, this is the lightest, easiest, and quickest blade sharpener out there.  5-star product without a doubt.
B0067LY4WG|3.0|As with most CDs this one only had a couple I really like.  The rest I tend to skip over.
B00B2QA2F4|4.0|First in order to get 5 stars from me a movie has to walk on water.  If you like GungFu movies this is a must for you.  Blood spurting in the Tarantino style, Hip Hop Rhythm from RZA.  The show has the gritty feel of a Western, sprinkled with some Ang Lee comic book panels so it may appeal more to GungFu lovers from the West than from Asia famed more for their peaceful and flowing movements.  Although the movie attempts to balance the Yin and Yang it has more Yang and more Tiger than Dragon which is great and perfectly acceptable coming from the Chi of a male director. Great fight scenes with nice special effects make it a modern treat. I have to say it is much better than average and shows some symbolic tribute to the late Bruce Lee as well, so I felt a lot of thought definitely went into the screen play from a Western perspective as a tribute to the martial arts theater genre.  3 Stars for the non-GungFu fan, a solid 4-4.5 stars for a GungFu theater lover.  Thanks Quentin and RZA for an enjoyable show from a GungFu fan.  (Not for Kids)
B009YQJ322|5.0|wow !! just wow Being a fan of the comic book since I was kid and being let down by that horrible Stallone flick  back in the 90's finally one of the few adaptations done  right!! Karl Urban owns this character he is Judge Dredd!!! He is the law!!
B0001HAISG|5.0|I saw this on TV and decided to order the movie. The boy who plays Peter is wonderful as are most of the other main characters (particularly Captain Hook and Wendy). Great family move.
0316069434|4.0|Love all Michael Connelly books.  Looking forward to more.  His books always have a twist and a turn in the plot.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|pretty good app only reason not 5 stars is because I purchased sale coins and app decided to stop working and restart all over with 0 coins not happy.  over all I do like game don't like that issue
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I have already seen this amazing TV serial, but with the Blu-ray format you can appreciate all the tiny details.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is my favorite type of g5 game puzzles were challenging and right mix of hob. cant wait for sequel or similar game.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|i believed it was better than the first , the technology they used and devices were pretty cool. gravity shift was neat.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I had no idea what I was getting into when I walked into this movie other than that there was a really s***ty one made with Rob Schnieder and Sly Stallone a long time ago. I was pleasantly surprised when I found this to be a very well made action movie.    I don't really know anything about Dredd, and all you need to know is that he is a guy who frowns a lot. That's it. Go See it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love horses so this game was a joy the only problem was gems should be easier to get I finally got the rainbow unicorn its awesome.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved the first and second book and I can't wait to read the third. Love is one of the strongest motivators!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ugh I need the last book! Love this story!!! Can't wait for book 3!! As good as 50 Shades! This is a must read
030758836X|1.0|There isn't a likeable character in the book, it jumps from implausible to downright ridiculous, and the ending is unbelievable. I wanted to just stop reading several times  but was interested in how it would end.  I'm sorry I did.  I should have listened to my instincts after the very first chapter.
B009PAETCG|3.0|Game ROCKED! HOWEVER -- now it's RUINED because of this very &quot;Review POP-UP.&quot; It stopped my playing and now I can't continue unless I write something for you.... would have been all good review if u just hadn't FORCED it on me.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I was most impressed by the quick delivery of the item.  And the story was a lot of fun to read and catch up on before seeing the third season on TV.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A song of ice and fire continues with another epic book full of complex characters, fantastic mythical creatures, romance, mystery, violence and intrigue. Overall a masterful work of literature.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I agree with a lot of other users, the free games have been mostly disappointing, but not this one. Really had fun with it.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|This was a really good book, although it seemed like when she was talking she wasn't speaking like a girl her age would.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The rest of the singers (including Hugh Jackman) did really well, but Russell Crowe was really stiff (in acting AND singing), so Crowe's tracks are somewhat disappointing. Anne Hathaway's performance was excellent.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen the movie, just be aware that this is not a studio recording. It is an exact cut from the movie soundtrack, so there are some weird pauses (that make sense when you see the movie) and random background noises on the album. All will make sense when you see the movie, just be aware of this.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I was playing the free version on my Kindle Fire HD and it worked great! But when I bought the full version it said &quot;Doodle God has stopped working.&quot;, So I'm really bummed out. BOTH Free and Full don't work... It would be a Five Star game if they fixed this. -Justin
0811877485|3.0|I was excited about the cute design of this product-- and the fact that it was not permanent bond.<br />Our 8 month old's room looked super cute when everything was set up as well.  However, I woke up to a rustling sound in the middle of the night and discovered that one of the decals fell from the wall into the middle of his crib.  Our walls are slightly bumpy and this may have been the root of the problem.  I needed to go out and buy another spray adhesive for this product, which will hopefully work. Unless your walls/planned sticking surface are absolutely smooth, I wouldn't suggest buying this product though.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|I'm a huge Foo Fighters fan and this was the best gift i ever bought myself. definatley enjoy it. i've listened to it everyday since i got it. did take a lot longer than i expected to get here but was very well packaged and carefully handled. any foo fan needs to get this vinyl even if you already have the cd or mp3 nothing compares to the sound of a vinyl.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Originally bought it so I could review it to see if grand children could watch it and ended up enjoying it myself.  Have watched it a couple of times.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Some aren't stuck but so many are.  Life seems to be a compromise between happiness and unhappiness, where most never win.  Although many it seems romanticize the carefree lifestyle portrayed in the words of this book, I read something profoundly deeper.  A lost soul searching for, but never finding what he was looking for.  Call me a cynic but do any of us ever find complete happiness?  At least he tried.
0545265355|4.0|The movie really followed the story line quite well so book one is rather anti-climatic for me.  Books two and three will be better because the story line is new to me.  Would buy again.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I was back and forth as to whether I even wanted to watch this.  Most remakes are not as good as the original movie.  This one was, if anything, better.
B008602KQI|4.0|I do enjoy this movie but as always it was not as good as the book. It seemed like they skipped a lot of stuff. I thought I should rewind to see if I missed things. Seems to me that is you hadn't read the book you wouldn't get as much out of the movie.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I missed Matt Damon but Jeremy Renner was a good choice for Bourne's successor.  I was rivited until the end.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I do enjoy this game it is very addictive. It is timed but you down have to remember anything like the card games.
1936891026|4.0|There are some very good ideas and suggestions presented.  I got a little turned off by the &#34;higher power&#34; emphasis.  It's the same problem that I had with Julia Cameron's &#34;The Artist's Way&#34;.  I'm really a nuts and bolts type person and the quasi-religious approach to seeking inspiration doesn't really resonate for me.  It may for other people.  There was enough good content that I just skipped over that section.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is awesome...I love it. It is so easy to watch from episode to episode, quick downloads, no commercials, great!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I'm not a huge Bruce Willis fan but this was a really good film.  I hated to see it end.  The plot premise was interesting and Joseph Gordon-Levitt was great as always.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a very fun app but sometimes it wont load and I have reloaded the app so I think it does have little glitches here and there but a very fun app other wise...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the show but it seems to be sliding downhill a little.  I'm not finding Season Three as good as the first two.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|I purchased for my daughter as a gift.  She hasn't been given it yet but we've seen it B-4 and just love it.  Especially the lullaby &#34;Baby of Mine&#34; scene.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|This was the most frustrating movie that I've watched in a long time.  I like Rob Pattison, David Cronenberg, and Dom DeLillo.  I was expecting to enjoy this film.  It was trying so hard to be intellectual that it just ended up being obscure, confusing, and - worst of all - really, really boring.  I was tempted to buy the book to see if I like that better but decided I didn't need to possibly repeat my experience with the film.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Usually by the third movie a James Bond actor has run into a wall of terrible plots. Skyfall surprised me. Gem of a bond film.
0761169253|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It's a quick read but it nailed me from the first page.  I loved this for all the reasons that I didn't love &#34;The War of Art&#34; or &#34;The Artist's Way&#34;.  Practical nuts and bolts advice.  Read it!
0767020308|5.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely! We bought this along with BBC's Sense & Sensibility, and though I loved that, I was just as pleased with Emma.<br /><br />I felt the casting was very well done with the exception of Harriet...sorry, but she's supposed to be pretty, and unfortunately Samantha Morton just isn't. Kate Beckinsale is great as the playful but misguided Emma, and though many reviews disagree, I found Mark Strong to be perfect as the stately character of Mr. Knightley. Frank Churchill is also very well portrayed; he manages to be very believable yet still show the character's overly-charming side, a difficult task. Olivia Williams as Jane Fairfax is aptly graceful and reserved. John Knightley was well played indeed, his line in the carriage as they travel to the Weston's is so funny, makes me laugh each time, he's so sarcastically pessimistic!<br /><br />If I had to find something to criticize , it would be the last scene, where Emma and Frank Churchill meet again- you don't get the same sense that he knows he's done wrong as you do in the book. I think they could have done better with that, but it is a minor error, and certainly should not affect this film's overall rating.<br /><br />This movie adheres closely to the book, nearly all the lines are taken from it. I love this film and would recommend it to all Jane Austen fans.<br /><br />Hope you purchase, watch, and enjoy it!
B0020M99LC|4.0|Daniel Craig is excellent and so was the movie.  I do miss the double entendre and string of sexual conquests from the original Bond movies  I guess it's a Bond for a new generation - a lot more action oriented.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game and have gotten several people hooked on it! we love to play against eachother and see who can get their star first.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Thriller to the end.  Christine is brave and strong throughout.  Great read for those looking for suspense.  Similar to Gone  Girl.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ahhh I didn't think I would get sucked in but I literally can not put my kindle down!! I'm obsessed, it's very steamy and intriguing!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I love this toy, and I hate every miserable piece of plastic in it. You take this on, and you make a deal with the devil. It will captivate you, it will never let you go until you conquer it, and it will fight you hammer and tongs for every millimeter of progress you make. It will gobble all your available time, destroy your relationships with your nearest and dearest, and will be the very life of a &#34;white elephant&#34; type gift exchange party. I've seen people fight like cats to get their hands on it, then disappear into a state of utter social autism while they drive themselves insane, willfully foregoing food, sleep, and showers in the process. Buy it at your peril.
0399160450|5.0|Clancey's key characters continue to deliver, in spades.  Do not miss this one.  Impossible to tell how much of it is Clancy and how much is Blackwood, and that's part of the charm.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Easy, enjoyable read. Makes for a good time passer while at my kids dance competitions. I would recommend to anyone.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|The first time I viewed this movie, I couldn't decide whether to cheer or boo, hiss or cry.  After the second screening, I decided it was cheer and that making this film was likely Merryl Steep's greatest act of courage to date, and one of her finest character portrayals.  It's human part of  history that would otherwise have been completely hidden from the world.  It isn't glitz, it's not tawdry; the heroine is a real person, one that most of us thought we saw, but never really did, with a fate that unfortunately awaits many of us, hidden just around some bend in the road.
B00979CS50|2.0|Like a number of other reviewers, I was really looking forward to this album w/Crazy Horse.  I figured some nice raw playing with a lot of emotion and soul.  Unfortunately, it's not here.  As a life long Neil fan, I am totally bummed.  I know it's hard to pin Neil down as to his style, etc... (like with the David Geffen nonsense), but the last few albums kinda bite.  Le Noise is just that. (more like \\"la merde\\")  Neil has dozens of great albums and many more songs that just speak to you, but none are on this release.  You know, getting old sucks, but seeing one of the heroes from your youth going south, just really makes me depressed.  Come on Neil, get ol' black cranking and wail!!!
0451232577|5.0|A real tour de force glimpse into the 20th century with all of its war, moments of peace, turbulence and heatbreak, populated throughout with real, true life, characters ranging from gritty to graceful.  If you like Pillars of the Earth, this and its sequel(s) will blow you away!
030759565X|5.0|debie is a great cook i love her book. i just made the apple crumb pie and all i can say is oboy thats an apple pie
0345404475|1.0|This book may have spawned Blade Runner, but in itself is on the wierd side of Sci-Fi and the reader constantly wonders what Dick was smoking as he typed.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Anyone who had read the book The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo will love this book and want to get the next one immedietely.  Great read.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I only discovered Smallville after it had ended and was being shown on reruns. I loved the story of Superman as a youth, and proceeded to purchase the whole series. Now I can go on a Smallville binge when ever I want.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|awesome game they really should create more games to this affect as it makes the child to use brain funtion.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|u know how on YouTube u have to download this link to get lava or water. well if u get this app u can get it all. even stuff that u cant get on minecraft pe. im playing minecraft pe 0.6.0

B00A8ECU24|5.0|so much fun bring back to when I was little. they don't make toys like this any more. fun fun fun
B002W5UVSM|5.0|I have wanting to read this book for years. When I saw it available in a Kindle version I downloaded it for my Android. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|This is more for younger guys then myself, but I can still compete with some of them. I take it as Bonding. Something that is really needed between Grand Pa and Grand Son. So for that reason I'll give it a five star.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game. I love horses and this game is really fun. You don't always have to have Internet connection. Which makes it nice when the kids want to play in the car.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was an easy read and one I didn't want to put down.  I enjoyed the writing style and chapter sequencing. All the members of my monthly book group liked the book and we had a very enjoyable meeting discussing it and the meaning of our favorite flowers.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Absolutely loved the book. I highly recommend it to others. I couldn't put it down  this was an amazing boom and must read
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Just fantastic!<br />I wanted this version because Hugh and Anne and Russell and the 'new' AMAZING actor Eddie Redmayne were INCREDIBLE! I have the original soundtrack from Andrew Lloyd Weber as well, but I have never loved a movie more.... so, this definitely satisfies any Les Mis 'need' you have!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I bought the full version at the beginning of the game. I really enjoyed the graphics, hoef games, puzzles, and storyline. That said, I have played many of these types of games and most of them did not cost $4.99!  That is the only reason I could not give this game the 4 stars that it deserves!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day was an easy read. Told the story in basically an everyday manner. And no, no operational details were revealed.
B008I43DYU|5.0|If you have any use for a calculator on your kindle then get this you will not be disappointed ;)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is not a book I would have picked up on my own, but luckily for me a friend read it and told me that if I was a dog lover (and I am) that I needed to read this book. This was a wonderful warm, funny, sad, bittersweet, totally heart warming book that will stay with me for a long time. It is an easy read and once I picked it up I could not put it down. Give this book a try. You will not be disappointed. If you are a dog owner it will make you take a second look at your dog and wonder what's going on in his head. It will also make you want to give your dog a great big hug. :)
159420411X|4.0|I find s&n highly interesting and rather refreshing to see the Bayesian approach so passionately promoted by a former poker player, as betting and Dutch book arguments have often been used as argument in favour of this approach. While it works well for some illustrations in the book, like poker and the stock market, as well as political polls and sports, I prefer more decision theoretic motivations for topics like weather prediction, sudden epidemics, global warming or terrorism. Of course, this passionate aspect makes s&n open to criticisms, like this one by Marcus and Davies in The New Yorker about seeing everything through the Bayesian lenses. The chapter on Bayes and Bayes’ theorem (Chapter 8) is a wee caricaturesque in this regard. Indeed, Silver sees too much in Bayes’ Essay, to the point of mistakenly attributing to Bayes a discussion of David Hume’s sunrise problem. (The only remark is made in the Appendix, which was written by Price—like possibly the whole of the Essay!—, and  P.S. Laplace is the one who applied Bayesian reasoning to the problem, leading to Laplace’s succession rule.) The criticisms of frequentism are also slightly over-the-top: they are mostly directed at inadequate models that a Bayesian analysis would similarly process in the wrong way. (Some critics argue on the opposite that Bayesian analysis is too much dependent on the model being “right”! Or on the availability of a fully-specified  model.) Seeing frequentism as restricted to “collecting data among just a sample of the population rather than the whole population” (p.252) is certainly no presenting a broad coverage of frequentism.<br /><br />The book is written in a fairly enjoyable style, highly personal (no harm with that) and apart from superlativising (!) everyone making a relevant appearance, I find it rather well-organised as it brings the reader from facts (prediction usually sucks) to the possibility of higher quality prediction (by acknowledging prior information, accepting uncertainty, using all items of information available, further accepting uncertainty, &tc.). I am not sure the reader is the wiser by the end of the book on how one should improve one’s prediction tools, but there is a least a warning about the low quality of most predictions and predictive tools that should linger in the reader’s ears…. I enjoyed very much the chapter on chess, esp. the core about Kasparov’s misreading the computer reasons for a poor move (no further spoiler!), although I felt it was not much connected to the rest of the book.<br /><br />There are plenty of graphs in s&n, which is great, but not all of them are at the Tufte quality level. For instance, Figure 11-1 about the “average time U.S. common stock was held” contains six pie charts corresponding to six decades with the average time and a percentage which could be how long compared with the 1950s a stock was held. The graph is not mentioned in the text. (I will not mention Figure 8-2!)ormation, accepting uncertainty, using all items of information available, further accepting uncertainty, &tc.).

B00APUQRPC|5.0|Love, love, love this movie! Right up there with Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino. Clintwood definitely delivers just like always. Timberlake and Adams are awesome and fall into their roles superbly!
0756404738|5.0|It is a wonderful continuation of Patrick Rothfuss’ Name of the Wind and as beautifully written. Obviously, because it is taking place in the same universe as the first volume and with mostly the same characters, some of the magic wears out, the beginning of the book at the University does not feel so exciting, even though it is like meeting back old friends, but then Kvothe has to leave and become the special agent of a local ruler, then an apprentice into a mercenary school. He also meets a legendary beautiful Fae, Felurian, does much more than survives the encounter, and starts becoming a legend. His very uncertain relation with Denna is underlying the whole book, with a frustrating pace that I hope will be explained in the next volume. While the writing style is as high as before, the plot has a few weaknesses that make the story contrived at times. For instance, the lengthy hunt for the forest bandits could have been both more elliptical and better motivated, while the training in Ademre does not seem that relevant, except to come up with a legendary sword ironically named Cæsura. But the part with Felurian and the subtle description of Kvothe’s half-abandon/half-resistance is masterly. And even though all sub-plots are not perfectly well-oiled and linked together, they tell great stories.<br /><br />It will alas take another three or four years before the next (and presumably last) volume appears but the interval is worth the wait as it lets Patrick Rothfuss hone his style and sharpen his story. So far, I still rank The Kingkiller Chronicles as the best fantasy series of the past ten years…
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Ordered this album as I have been a fan of Susan Boyle since she appeared on the scene and this album, Standing Ovation:  The Greatest Songs From the Stage did not disappoint.
0765325950|4.0|It is now over: I have finished reading the last volume of the Wheel of Time, A Memory of Light. When considering that I started reading the first volume in Ithaca in the summer of 1990, while visiting Cornell, there is something momentous (and bitter-sweet) in reading the last page and acknowledging it is now over. For good. As many other WoT fans, I grew attached to some of the characters, despite the repetitions, the often immature psychology, and attitudes that varied from one volume to the next... It is thus a wee sad to see them vanish with the last page (or, worse, die within the last volume for three of them). Even though 14 volumes plus a prequel is more than enough. Of course, this feeling is nothing compared with what the second author, Brandon Sanderson, must feel! As he mentions on his blog, he had read the very final scene in 2007, soon after Robert Jordan's death, when he was asked to complete the series...<br /><br />I will not get into details about this last volume as I do not want to post spoilers. And because Leigh Butler did a much better job! (Warning: many many spoilers!) Let me mention however that the book stands to the previous volumes written by Sanderson, at the very least, and certainly above some of the weakest volumes written by Jordan. The battle that occupies a large part of the book has enough shifts and surprises to make it bearable, even though there are too many \\"happy endings\\" in my taste. Including the very final scene. Maybe not so surprisingly the two major characters in this volume are Perrin and Matt (thanks to the nice trick about the great captains). They have certainly grown in stature and depth from the first volume, even though they are not free from the occasional relapse. The roles of Rand, Nynaeve and Moiraine are somewhat anticlimactic as they seem to be doing nothing! (Of course, they only seem!) The forces facing each other sound very disproportionate and it is hard to understand why the dark side does not make use of those superior forces from the beginning. (The same question applies to the whole series, somehow!) I must also acknowledge being a bit disappointed by the (homely) final chapter. (Nothing terrible like the very final chapter of Harry Potter of course!) I can understand Jordan's motivations in writing it and it somehow makes sense. Still, not the ending I would have liked to read for this superlative epic! Nonetheless, I think Sanderson did a magnificent job in merging the notes of Robert Jordan into a coherent and enjoyable ending. That it took three rather than one volume is more a testimony to the complexity of the universe Jordan created than a nuisance (now that the series is over!). May he always find water and shade!se of those superior forces from the beginning. (The same question applies to the whole series, somehow!)

055358894X|5.0|I loved the book and read it in less than twenty four hours! It is a sort of fantasy Ocean’s Eleven, following my son’s description of the book, setting a clever con artist in a Venezia-like city and following his team through increasingly complex schemes until all falls apart. The dialogues are quite funny, the setting is completely convincing, and the background plot unravels superbly. Even though it is a single-volume read, I am clearly looking forward the second volume in the series. Red seas under red skies. (The following volumes are in the coming, apparently due to an on-going depression of the author…) One highly critical review of  The lies of Locke Lamora on Strange Horizons Reviews induced a lot of flak: I however think the reviewer makes the right point when she states that “Lamora [the character] is not very interesting”. It is true that the book somehow lacks an in depth psychological analysis of the characters, incl. Locke Lamora. Nonetheless, I keep a fairly good overall impression of it and do recommend it.

B000025XKM|5.0|\\"Pink Moon\\"(1972)...is the 3rd and final recording we were blessed with by Nick Drake...<br />This album consists of Nick alone-vocals,acoustic guitar and piano-where on his previous releases \\"Five Leaves Left\\"(1969) and \\"Bryter Layter\\"(1970)...he was accompanied by studio musicians, also featuring John Cale, and with bass and string arrangements provided by the Excellent Robert Kirby...<br />Pink Moon is an essential piece of music history...and will be forever recognized as some of Nick's finest work...<br />Although ANY of the [3] albums are sure to please...I own all [3] and would be lost without them...<br />How strange that Nick died in 1974...5 years(leaves)after the album \\"Five Leaves Left\\" was released...<br />He is sadly missed-a poet, a wisened old soul who died at an all too early age...yet the perfect age to preserve who and what he was.

B002MC9H8K|5.0|[[ASIN:0060001941 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]<br /><br />Excellent depiction of that early 1900's. I couldn't put this book down, and when I got closer to the last few pages I was so hoping that there were more.  No matter how hard life was for this family.....the little girl kept her dreams alive.
0439023521|5.0|Great book with many twist and interesting moments. Loved it! Can't wait to read something else from the author. 5 stars!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 3 year old loves the puzzles in this app! Especially, once he figures out the puzzle, balloons would appear and he can pop them. My son was never really interested with puzzles until this app. Now, all he wants to do is to put puzzles together. The free app only gives him a few puzzles to play with and you would have to by the upgrade to get more puzzles or get the same app with cars and trucks. So far, my son is happy playing the same puzzles over and over but I know eventually I would spend the money for the upgrade. I highly recommend this app!
030758836X|5.0|Great book with many twist and interesting moments. Loved it! Can't wait to read something else from the author... 5 stars

B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved the way the \\"what came before\\" was woven into this book.  Really made it deeply connect to the first one.
0307719774|5.0|I got this book as a gift in 2011 and bought one for a friend this year because I've enjoyed it so much. The questions range from thought-provoking to yes-or-no, and they're all easy and quick enough to answer in under a minute.<br /><br />The space allowed for answering is a bit small, but I prefer it that way, because I don't have to spend a huge amount of my time writing down my answers every day. I've tried journaling in the past or writing every day, but it has been too much of a time commitment. That's why I like the Q&A a Day book - it's quick and easy, and it's incredibly fun to compare your answers year after year.<br /><br />I've had mine for a little over a year now. It's been through some traveling and tossing around, and it's still in pretty great condition.<br /><br />My only complaint with this book is that there's no ribbon attached to the binding to help you remember which day you're one. You have to flip through the pages and find the right date every day. Other than that, this is the perfect gift for yourself or a for a friend.
B003CH8X02|4.0|Steve Hackett has another winner of a rock album. Is it prog? sometimes. Does this prog head like it? you bet. Everything doesn't have to be &#34;Defector&#34; or &#34;Voyage To The Acolyte.&#34; Steve is relevant in the 21st century beacuse no two albums are the same.
1416960953|5.0|The content of this book is awesome. A lot of detail and creativity. A must have for children who love Spiderwick Chronicles.
B0010358CQ|5.0|Now this is a great animated film! Graphics are clear and crisp. The motion capture really adds to the action. The story is really good. It had me guessing far into the film as to who the evil culprits were. It even has some nice social tones, making the characters more believable.<br /><br />The sound is fantastic. The music is varied and very good. This was well directed. Even the guns sound great.<br /><br />Appleseed Ex Machina is a great science fiction animated film. I am glad I took a chance and purchased this very positve film. Now if they'll just make a video game ...
B00936A0RU|5.0|Lawless---Loved this movie, Great movie-Hardy was great, so was the whole cast.  Lot of action and somethings unexpected.  Five stars.
B00127RAJY|3.0|The 30 day shred dvd was a good workout, but I found it boring. Most of the moves were very basic.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Arrived really fast.  Good series but it is very disturbing on many levels during this life and times in America and the world
0345803485|3.0|It was a good read for what it was, but I felt it could have been better. Very repetitive in it's description of the main character blushing practically every other sentence.
0525952926|5.0|Good price on a hardback.  I love this writer and hope I like this book as much as his others
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not the average romance story! I was surprised throughout the entire book about what was going on and I was locked into it by the end of the first chapter. I couldn't put it down!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I think the headline of this review says it all.  As a member of the undead, I had been waiting for a show to come out displaying my daily interactions with the &#34;living&#34;.  Needless to say, this show accomplishes this, showing the hardships we must endure (stabbings in head, arrows to skull, clubbings, mutilation, etc.) as we search for food and try to get hugs from the &#34;living&#34;.  They rarely let us get close enough to show them just how much we care, but when they do, they typically come around after a hug and sometimes they even join us!

B001QOGYBI|5.0|This is a classic tale, and a classic Wes Anderson movie at that.  It takes a certain film fan to appreciate most of Wes Anderson's work though I would say this has broader appeal than most of his films, particularly Darjeeling Limited and Life Aquatic.<br /><br />Great for young and old alike.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This game is pretty easy and fun to play. Moves along well and has some funny bits. Nice bright pictures and a good mix of puzzles.

B0000549B0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Jimmy Stewart is perfect. Harvey the Puma, or invisible giant rabbit, causing mischief in everyone's lives. You don't see movies, or acting, like this anymore.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|A modern reboot of a beloved classic TV show, the original was before my time.  However, I did enjoy this one, was worth the rental.
B0012DP8A6|4.0|Despite this being the digital video that is linked to the Little Shop of Horrors: Director's Cut DVD and Blu-Ray, this is *not* the Director's Cut. It's the original theatrical release. It's a really excellent movie, but not what I thought I was buying. If you haven't seen this movie, you should--just be aware that there is an even better version out there, but this one is by no means bad, and better to see this than nothing (since the the Director's Cut doesn't seem to be available for streaming anywhere).
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|for a video game story to make it to the movie stage and remain intact and true to its roots, yet have a interesting story that is on the big screen without beeing mangled is awesome all by its self.  Nice movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|There is one word that describes this game perfectly: AWESOME!  This is the best mobile app in the world.  It lets your imagination run wild!  It runs perfectly on my Kindle Fire, and has no bugs.  It's worth every penny.  Plus, they come out with FREE updates every once in a while.
B00571F26Y|3.0|After reading the book, I had a lot of new ideas to consider.  I didn't try the diet as I felt it was really complicated.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Classic Vince Flynn and another thrilling story line with Mitch Rapp as his centerpiece. Love how Flynn has the pulse of how serious our \\"War on Terror\\" should be approached and how some at top levels of the government would rather be PC than to do whatever's necessary to take the fight to the enemies of the USA and freedom.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is probably the most addicting game I've ever played! It is great for the kindle fire! Love it.
B00AI41PSY|5.0|This Is the best vinyl record I have ever owned! I have over 300 vinyl records, but this is one that I will listen too over and over again! You can really notice the change in sound quality from the old versions of elo's hits compaired to the new ones! My favorite thing about these albums are that they are clear blue in color...they are not black like the mojority of other records! Amazing!!!!!!!

1250007208|5.0|I am so smitten with this book. Between the twisted fairy tale references, the futuristic setting, and the strong characters, it just flat out worked for me. Cinder's world isn't always pretty. There's some pretty screwy social inequality -- between both the working class and the royalty and between Cinder and everyone who isn't a cyborg -- and the entire planet is teetering on the brink of war with the Lunars, but it's balanced by Cinder's strength and Kai's willingness to do the right thing even at a very steep personal cost. The entire world is so wonderfully imagined that I couldn't get enough of it.<br /><br />Cinder's life, much like in the classic fairy tale, is one of hardship. Her faithful companion is mechanical and her only real human friend is powerless to stop the abuse that her stepmother heaps upon her. She's trapped by what she is -- part human, part machine -- and disobedience is dealt with swiftly, sometimes in small, petty ways and sometimes horrifically. Even after Prince Kai and she come into contact, Cinder is practical enough to realize that daydreaming about him is a waste of time and won't help her get the places she needs to go. Except that she keeps getting thrown into his path and, gosh, maybe he's not such a waste of time after all.<br /><br />I loved the idea of the Lunars and their crazy queen. Literally crazy, you know. The lady is sneaky and manipulative, dangerous and without mercy. The hints of what's brewing on the moon (and in later books) is creepy and sounds like we -- and Cinder -- are going to be in for one heck of a ride. I can't wait!<br /><br />This twisted, futuristic retelling is wonderfully done. It's dark, sad, horrifying, and sweet all at once. Cinder has her work cut out for her and I'm ready to see where her journey takes her.<br /><br />-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal
0743270754|5.0|I am still not completely finished with this book, but I would never NOT complete it as it is so informative and thought-provoking, I just cannot stop reading it. You must concentrate your undivided attention while reading it, however, as it is similar to reading a well-written history book and the author excels in her delivery of such fascinating facts regarding Lincoln the man.
014241543X|5.0|I was warned that I'd need a box of tissues nearby while reading this one. Those who warned me weren't lying. I cried. More than once. I thought I could withstand the deluge but the pressure builds and builds until it reaches the breaking point and then one tiny little thing pushes it over and suddenly it was all about the tears.<br /><br />It really was the little moments that did it to me. The moment when Mia realizes what she's lost even though we've known all along. The moment when she's given permission to make her choice, for good or bad, by someone she loves.<br /><br />Mia's journey isn't easy. It's lovely and sad and heartbreaking all at the same time. Her world has been shattered by a static moment in time and as you see how tightly her life is woven in with her mother, her father, and her brother, you can see that the decision on whether to stay or go is weighing her down.<br /><br />I'm still a little shell-shocked to be honest. This book had a slow emotional build and when it finally boils over, it's overwhelming. It's beautiful. It's sad. It hurts a little to read. And I would do it all again.<br /><br />-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal
B005YDLJ76|5.0|This movie was everything I expected and so much more. Parts of the DVD includes personal parts of her life such as her wedding dress in I Was Here. I love her!!! -Beyhive
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|What a beautifully written, sad and deliciously happy book. I laughed, I cried, and could not put it down. Great book.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|From its daring conception till its definitive release (this one), \\"Smile\\" remains one of the greatest works of art in pop music history. This box set acknowledges and honors that with a beautiful packaging filled with hours and hours of extra goodies adding to an already formidable record. Definitely a collector's item, but still a worthy investment for any true music fan.

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|World at arms is a great game. It's very challenging and competitive.  The only problem is that there is not alot of human players.

B008PCVGKI|4.0|This book is for both patients and doctors to read it is about what happens when corporations control products and are immensely powerful.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book bc it was entertaining. The characters were well developed. I had no idea how it would end- so it held my attention! I would recommend this book for pure enjoyment - not a deep sort of book.  But fun! Probably good for a book chat group as well.  Also read dark places by same author.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I beat the whole game in an hour I hate how people are saying they cant get passed the first screen use the hint guide in the book
B001NLKS16|3.0|...but I was hoping for something more gripping.  Not exactly sure what more or exactly how it missed the mark for me.  Left me wanting something more or different... than what it delivered.  I also got Bobby Singer's book but haven't read yet.  Hoping I like that more...
044654146X|5.0|Well researched & comparative analysis of Israel with other countries with similar demographics & cultures.<br />It's inspiring to struggling entrepreneurs in hi tech and especially those who have encountered their first  failure.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I was looking for an app to replace my sound machine and this is it. Love the brown noise - so soothing.
B000007T1M|5.0|hard edged music for the first effort from this group. it has elements reminiscent of blood sugar sex magic from the peppers. the lyrics have a lot of interesting twists and turns that keep you going.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am very selective about the apps I download and I enjoy playing this game. Warning - can be very addictive!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I was looking for something to help me block out office noise while at work... the combinations of sounds that can be created in this app turned out to be just what I was looking for.  I listen via headphones, so I can turn on the 'binaurals beats' setting to concentration and have that layered into whatever background I've got going on.<br /><br />I have also been using the app at home for ambiance when I meditate and also for relaxing.  Great combinations of sounds.  I can save my favorites to return to again...or try out some of the other sound combinations when I'm looking for something different.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|absolutely mind blowing. Not only does this documentary explain the hideous truth of the gross industrialized food world but it explains it in a very easy, interesting way to understand exactly whats going on. changed the way i eat and look at food forever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome and addicting! its very fun. I reccomend this game to all the people that like temple run.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|First book a definite must read. Eric Nylund a great author for the Halo series. Would recommend to any Halo fan.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This books definitely touched my heart. Normally I wouldn't read a book about high schoolers but this book came highly recommended. I was in shock most of the time I was reading this book. Sky & Holder are amazing together. There came a point in the book that I sort of knew what was going to happen but it didn't take away from the greatness!! Even though there is sex and language in this book, I recommended it to a friend of mine for her daughter who is a senior in high school. True love between Sky and Holder and overcoming problems is what people need to read about
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really enjoyed the game. Never lost interest, played it straight through to the end in one evening. Will definitely play it again.
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|This game is an obvious mario clone, and it dosn`t hide it. Not a great game by any means, one sitting kind of game. And the difficulty. SO AGONIZINGLY EASY! Levels will take 2 min, tops. Also, it says its a &quot;platformer&quot;. Mostly just enemies and blocks, herp derp. The platforming is so easy, yet rare. And don`t get me started on the gold pots. Not good.<br />At all.<br /><br />Yeah, it sucks.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Can not wait for part two. Good graphics, challenging yet not too difficult. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|All the accessories fits properly and safely. the compartment size can be changed as per the need.<br />It is value for money.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the<br /> book very much and plan on reading the other books in the trilogy.<br />I recommend this book to anyone.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|A very great way to pass the time, easy way to stay off the scale of bored. Me and my 12 year old love this!
B000RH0C8G|5.0|As a lifelong A's fan, I loved the Bash Brothers, Shooty Babitt, the guy who did a hook slide when rounding first base, Rickey Henderson, and all the rest.  Billy Beane proved that you could win without a bunch of overpriced primadonnas.  This book shows how.  As a bit of a purist, it pains me that defense is rather incidental in Billy's world of talent appreciation.  Don't get me wrong.  The A's looked atrocious at times--particularly running the bases.  But you can't argue with the results.  Now everyone does it.  And with heavier wallets.
B0030BCCB6|5.0|More blues oriented tunes. True 60's Fleetwood Mac before they went with POP tunes. I like it a lot. I am not much of a music critic so I will say, IF you like blues you will like this. If you are expecting Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham tunes, you will be disappointed.

B00164GDD2|5.0|Arrived in perfect condition.  Wonderful film to finaly view in blu ray quality.  I will definitely be back for more.
B008Z9L94O|5.0|Wanted to weigh in on the sound quality debate.  I agree that Zero has some strange levels and sound issues, but the rest of the album sounds pretty great.  I've listened to it on two different turntables and unless you want to pay top $$$ for an original pressing of MCATIS, this one is well worth your time and investment.  I dont regret the purchase at all.
B001AQO400|5.0|Arrived in perfect condition.  Wonderful film to finaly view in blu ray quality.  I will definitely be back for more.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|After hitting a certain level, everything counts that goes over the side.  There's no longer a challenge to the game.
B0011TZTLE|5.0|I chose the rating b/c its literally a classic and opportunity to hear a live concert without being there.  Great Album !!!
B009ZI5DGY|3.0|The movie is good, but could have been better. The bonus disc is for completists only, and I am a Quo fanatic! Three extra hours of fairly ordinary footage, and no mention of Roy Lynes, the original keyboard player, or any attempt to interview him. Some earlier obscure clips (Price Of Love, Make me Stay A Bit Longer) would have been good.
B0056BBO1W|3.0|You know they saturated all his songs so when i got the album i expected more new stuff but i'll take whats on there and live life ...
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I saw this movie on hd but definetly the blu-ray is the best...the picture and the quality are superb, great

0345803485|5.0|I was surprised at how engrossed I became with this book.  It was erotic but without the crass I expected.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|love this game I loved the first one and I'm so glad a second one came out. little hard but its worth it!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Temple Run 2 was great at first. There are a lot of problems with it though. For example, the sensitivity stinks, most of the time it won't turn or jump. Second, when I went to play it this morning it had erased all of my data for no reason. The animations are great, but that's the only good thing about this game. Nothing will replace the original Temple Run.

B004A8ZWW4|4.0|I like the kid in the story as he didn't take any crap from the adults. He stole the show and was smarter than the older people in the story though he should be.<br />Very good action movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is sweet game because it's is almost like the computer .....<br />If you don't like it you should get blow up by a creeper.<br /><br />  By' jaden
B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|I had to watch this movie twice to figure out what was going on? Seems that there may have been some parts left out to fit the standard time frame for movies these days. The action was good.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is really fun!  Can also be rather addictive.  The program has run perfectly for me though other reviews mentioned some problems.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing I love the whole thing. It was the best book ever. I think the next will be to good
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I downloaded this for free and didn't have high expectations, the cover picture makes it seem suitable to a younger crowd and the basic premise of getting drunk and married in a Las Vegas chapel seemed predictable.  But I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I couldn't put it down and was sad to have it end, it was a little slow to get going but when it did it took off!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|HAVING BEEN TO INDIA WHILE WORKING FOR A COMPANY, MADE ME ENJOY THIS MOVIE A LOT MORE...I CAN RELATE TO ALOT OF THE CULTURAL CHANGES AND CROWDS OF PEOPLE.  THEY ARE ALL TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING THE SAME WAY WE ARE...THE PEOPLE ARE VERY KIND & FRIENDLY. THEY TRY HARD TO PLEASE. I CAN ALSO RELATE TO SENIOR CITIZENS HAVING TO RETIRE ON A FIXED INCOME...ONE HAS TO LEARN TO BLEND IN AND HAVE A GOOD ATTITUDE & YOU'LL LOVE THIS MOVIE. JUDY DENCH & MAGGIE SMITH AT THEIR BEST.  IT'S A STORY OF LOVE, FRIENDSHIP, SENIOR SEX, GAY RELATIONSHIPS, HELPING ONE ANOTHER.<br />I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The movies I was so really good and I get really fast thanks so much<br />and continue like that.. see you soon
B00AQMQBKK|3.0|I love the arkham board game, but i was disappointed by this app.  I dont like the dice mechanics.  It almost feels like there are hidden modifiers to make it more difficult to get the results you need.  Im sure people will say its random, but it just doesnt feel like it.  The rare runes drop like candy when all you want is a clue rune, then you can have every dice come up clue every summons when all you want is a scroll.  Something doesnt feel right.<br /><br />I'd rather have the arkham board game as an app.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|I was really Good movie and<br />perfect image and pretty funny<br />my Family I was really Happy thanks for yours service
B002JWD6AS|3.0|Very cool!<br /><br />I felt the first half of this book was really slow, but I started to warm to it half way through.<br /><br />I loved that it took place in Minnesota. Not sure I'm going to read the subsequent books.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A must read- great coming of age story. A book that really connects with the reader and evokes a wide range of emotions. Couldn't put it down.
B008476HBM|5.0|There is nothing  to be said  said about Pride and Prejudice that had not already been said.  It truly is one of the best books ever written.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|got the game for my 9 and 11 year old sons.  Hours of fun and enjoyment.  no problems with downloads or gameplay on kindle fire hd
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was the best book I have ever read! The best out of all the Percy Jackson's. It was great.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I purchased this app for my sons, and they all enjoyed trying to keep up with the music.  wouldn't pay a lot for it by free or $1 is ok.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game Is simply epic.Please be sure to buy this game. I can't believe that this is FREE.This is like Mario bros on kindle.
B008N1V11U|5.0|my three sons really love this game.  It was well worth the money.  they enjoy the story line and the graphics are excellent.  controls were easy enough for my 9 year old to handle.  no problems with download or gameplay.  you do have to download extra material, but I had plenty of room for it and no problems on my kindle fire hd
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this game but after awhile it will delete my progress but I love the game its really fun.
B00AECDDYY|3.0|My 13 year old son says the game is ok for a while, but gets boring and repetitive.  He like the graphics tho.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I needed it and it serve the purpose for what it was needed.<br />thank you so much<br />will purchase again
B008I34ZUM|5.0|great deal on this classic! I've been a fan for a very long time. This is one of my all time favorites. Glad it is still available
B000VZJUGY|5.0|When I was 11 I had to sneak the cassette of this to listen to it and somehow got away with buying it with an explicit lyrics sticker as an 11 year old somewhere and man did this album rock my world, I was listening to Tool and Nine Inch Nails at 11, a bit odd but it shaped my love of music even more and I still rock this album from time to time.<br />You little emo kids or whatever that are in high school listening to taking back infidelities or any day of the week or month with a morbid synonym in front or after it bands or whatever, this album is the real deal : )
B00785P2QC|5.0|Cute, addictive game. You don't have to spend real money unless you want to. My kids and I both enjoy playing.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was very bored with this book for like the first 40% of it. Nothing exciting really happened. I was going to give up on it but I hate not finishing books! So I continued and it got very exciting! Super sad and I def cried a few times. It has it's sweet moments between the leading guy and girl, who are both high school students. if you reading this expecting there to be graphic love scenes, there arent any because they are kids but it is still a beautiful story about an important issue.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very fun and interesting game it is very entertaining it is also very<br />Difficult at some  times but is also very  fun<br />-madison
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app!! There's may things u can do to edit your photos on this app! and it has many different effects u can apply to make your photo amaZayn, phenomiNiall, extrodinHarry, fabLouis, brilLiam and 1Derful!!! and before u ask, yes I'm a Directioner&infin;!! Don't hate
B005COO1X6|1.0|That's it ?  Not one of Kings best  .  Needed a better ending..what happened to the kids and Pete and the horse
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I can't believe Cold Fact wasn't a hit in 1970 or that it didn't get more playing time on the radio.  It was tantamount to finding a hidden treasure!  And the documentary &#34;Searching For Sugarman&#34; is an inspirational story - a must see!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery--cool, calm, collected. Best of all, he leaves the ending open to more action and adventures to follow.  My husband and I really enjoyed this movie.
0321714113|4.0|I chose this book on the recommendation of many users and coders. I give this book three (and half) stars only not because it is not for beginners but I think the balance between presentation of concepts and their immediate practice and application is not efficient for learning (especially for the initiate). But as a reference book, it is very comprehensive deserves five stars.<br /><br />So I will refer back to this book when I reach the intermediate stages of learning Cpp. I'll keep the book.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I will leave a lengthier review to some other ardent Rush fans, though I have loved them since their start! This CD really grows on me and I have listened to it at least 50 times or more! The production and mix is far superior to any of their releases (IMO) since the mid 1980's! I am a huge fan of the classic Rush sound and &#34;A Farewell to Kings&#34; is my favorite Rush recording. But, I have to say, I would have to put &#34;Clockwork Angels&#34; next in in line followed by &#34;2112&#34;. That should say it all!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Less than two weeks after getting the case the screen was cracked, the flap going over the place to insert your charger was broke  off. So not purchase this product!
B006UG90RM|5.0|I have to say, the first time I heard &#34;Tattoo&#34; I was instantly disappointed! But by the third time through the CD, I loved every bit of it. It really harkens back to the time when I &#34;discovered&#34; VH while working as DJ in a commercial Rock station in 1977 or so. We got the new LP's in for the week and I was immediately intrigued with VH. I loved the whole recording and saw them later that spring as an opening act for Journey. They were magnificent. This CD whirled me back to those days.<br /><br />While I have nothing bad to say about Wolfgang, I really miss Michael Anthony on this record. I did see VH in Louisville, the first night of their 2012 tour and Wolfie is truly an awesome musician! But so is Mike and he deserves to be on this record.
B00004VYF6|1.0|I purchased this as a backup as I so enjoy my previous copy purchased from Amazon. I did not have the occasion to view it until last night when I discovered it is for the European market and will not play on my American DVD or Computers. Now it is too late for exchange.
1400067820|5.0|I am still working through the book but, it really should be required reading for most any college student or responsible adult! In the United States, we simply want to be comfortable and that leads to destruction. Taleb builds the foundation that everyone should understand, disorder is necessary for life and growth!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was a valuable resource for the universe and is the best way for the kindle to be used we had a lot o fun
B009DJB9HC|4.0|This one really had to grow on me. I love the production and the inclusion of Jason Bonham into the song writing process. I also like the fact that they brought the keys up in the mix, especially the Hammond tones! While I don't want to be too harsh, I felt the whole CD sounded a bit too hastily put together. I love Glenn Hughes but, I still like more equalization between his vocals and Joe B's.<br /><br />Keep 'em commin' guys! I love your work.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book filled me with suspense and I was always wondering what was going to happen next. This is my favourite book so far.
B007M45PMU|5.0|In the same alley as Mumford and Sons, I look forward to the band crisping up their chops.  Lots of talent, I hope they sustain and grow.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Best way I can review this is to suggest you just watch this show from the very start and let yourself be slowly drawn into Westeros. The entire saga has just the right amount of magic, politics, sex, greed, hope, witchcraft, humor and so much perfectly combined and written by JRRM - today's Tolkien.<br /><br />Long Live House Stark !!
B009KY0WCI|5.0|David Fray is a French pianist in his early thirties who has magnetism of presence, handsome good looks, and a style of pianism that seems to draw a line between those who think he breathes fresh air into the classic wonders of Bach and those who think he takes too much personal touch for the purist. In arguments such as that it seems what gets lost is the actual music of the performance captured, because if anyone can simply sit and listen to this airbourne and heartfelt performance of 3 of Bach's miracles then the magic of the pause in time between the invention of these masterworks and their performance here just vanishes.<br /><br />There is a warmth and light approach to Fray's phrasing, a lingering on a musical resolution of a line that some would say is more of the Romantic school. And according to Fray's thoughts,  `We shouldn't be afraid of acknowledging the expressiveness of Bach's music. The Romantics don't have a monopoly on expressivity!' Fray's style is a combination of intellectual concentration and natural exuberance and has been likened to that of the late Glenn Gould, though Fray's own hard, bright patina does not carry the sonority of the discrete notes to the pointillistic extreme Gould sought.<br /><br />For instance, in the Partita for Keyboard No. 2 in C minor critic Gary Lemco describes it very well: `The C Minor Partita allows Fray to exert first, in the Sinfonia, his expressive powers in lofty, French-Overture style as well as in the chromatic layering required in toccata passages that take the form of a three-part invention. Fray applies a persuasive shapeliness to the Allemande, and many will sense a \\"romantic\\" allure in his melodic voicings.  The contrapuntal brio in the Courante has Fray's singing along in throaty grumbles. The Sarabande, based on a stylized Spanish dance, here proceeds as staid duet, parlando, in a nostalgic mood.  The last two movements, Rondeau and Capriccio, respectively, enjoy a spirited articulation and bravura fluency, once again peppered with Fray's gutturals. The breathless pace of the last movement does not prevent the bouncy joie de vivre from completely overtaking our buoyant feet in response to a fleet, spontaneous performance.'<br /><br />Granted there are those who object to Fray's interpretations as much as Lemco praises them, but in the end it is up to the ear of the listener.  And for this ear the balance between technical prowess and interpretive tenderness is most satisfying.<br />The works here are: Toccata in C minor, BWV 911, Partita for Keyboard no 6 in E minor, BWV 830 and Partita for Keyboard no 2 in C minor, BWV 826 Grady Harp, February 13uency, once again peppered with Fray's gutturals. The breathless pace of the last movement does not prevent the bouncy joie de vivre from completely overtaking our buoyant feet in response to a fleet, spontaneous performance.'<br /><br />Granted there are those who object to Fray's interpretations as much as Lemco praises them, but in the end it is up to the ear of the listener.  And for this ear the balance between technical prowess and interpretive tenderness is most satisfying.<br />The works here are: Toccata in C minor, BWV 911, Partita for Keyboard no 6 in E minor, BWV 830 and Partita for Keyboard no 2 in C minor, BWV 826 Grady Harp, February 13
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Needed it for Christmas and luckily it was a daily deal. They do not make movies like this anymore! :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game. easy to learn. love progressing through the levels. try it. you'll have fun with it too. highly recommend
B000FA5TTW|4.0|it was one of those books I couldnt put down .. excellent.  i would. recomend this to friends and family
0307352153|5.0|High recommend to other introverts out there--and those who love them so they understand their temperaments and behaviors.  Nothing else.
1426308469|5.0|Great facts, presented in a way that keeps kids reading. We love this book as much as every book we have from this series. I highly recommend them.
B0049VZ222|2.0|This show is highly rated.  I watched the first episode.  Got somewhat intrigued as to what caused all of these zombies to be walking around, but didn't stay with it.  Just not into zombies I guess.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|For anyone looking to read about SEAL training, Iraq tactical approaches,  how snipers operate, as well as insights into Chris Kyle himself then this is a great book for you. It reads rather fast and intersperses chronological events with related personal topics.<br /><br />Chris Kyle, RIP.
B005LTDPJI|5.0|Love this set! The booklet that comes with it is wonderful, and the extra tracks are really cool. I love hearing the alternate takes of songs I know by heart. The album covers are true to their originals (gatefold albums are still gatefold, just in &#34;miniature&#34; CD size). I'm so happy to finally have all my ELO albums on CDs - have really missed listening to these songs.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very good book. Every character is just perfect. In most books, the boy of whom the  main character loves is usually....perfect. smart, popular, attractive, funny, nice...healthy. Downright perfect. But Augustus is not perfect. I liked this, because in reality, no one  is perfect.<br /><br />I love the literature references and allusions, mainly because love reading and writing and I hope to be like a Hazel Lancaster, who can quote books and recite poetry.<br /><br />This books was truly touching. I am a movie/book cryer, but this one made me bawl. It captures the perfect image of cancer survivors, and those who don't survive. Hazel Grace' s thoughts made so much sense, as if they were coming from someone who truly did fight lung cancer.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book is definitely a 5-star must-read. Of all the books I've read, this one has left me at a loss for words the most. There are no words in my vocabulary , almost, that could describe this book. I hope this review turns you into the right direction.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I found this selection of songs surprising but just love Jeff Lynne's voice and his interpretations of this music. It's strange to hear his voice - at once so very familiar to me - on songs that he didn't write! Yes, he has done some covers in the past, but let's face it, it IS rare. The album art is also quite interesting and poignant - you can see Jeff standing in one of the doorways on the street. This CD is quite a treat!
B0036S4C6G|5.0|A fantastic book!!! Interesting story, and a very nice way of telling it, from the view of subsequent, different, persons.
1451695195|4.0|Eben alexander jr was one of my mentors during my neurology training. The story of the screw driver is true. Until I read this book, I was a skeptic regarding after-life stories. But this book has changed my outlook. I plan to use this story for a sunday school lesson next week.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|lots of fun. awesome game. big thumbs up. would definitely recommend.  lots of fun. would recommend to all ages of
0807014273|5.0|Really enjoy this old book and the wisdom of Viktor Frankl. It was so very good to read it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Teen book.  Characters (Holder) not realistic...especially for a teenager.  Grown men aren't this mature, loyal, or skillful with words or bodies.  Oh....and predictable.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I was prettyexcited to see this app finally arrive for the Fire.  unfortunately,  I found it tobe more frustrating to use and finally had to delete.<br /><br />As I type, if I am spelling a word that has a few letters that match afriend or page name that I have &quot;liked,&quot; it tries to automatically. add.  When I try to just ignore, whenI finish typing the actual word intended,  it just deleted that word entirely.  it is so frustrating.<br /><br />I submitted feedback on this a couple of weeks ago but obviously do not expect to hear anything.  Hopefully, if anybody else is experiencing the same thing, they will report it!
B00005B1W5|5.0|I had this before but lost it in a fire.  I love his music and the talent of his musicians.
B0085LMFAE|5.0|Incredible production.  Always liked the Graceland album but this cd is incredible. Its as relevant today as it was 25 years ago.  A very special addition to my collection!
B0083I90HU|5.0|Love this book. Highly recommend it to all high school students. Shows the reader history as it was at that time. Amazing & beautifully written.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This show is about determination. The action is taking place in the Hampton,among the very rich, and very bad people full of dangerous secrets. As the plots thickened it became more and more difficult for me to turn off the TV.
B007R21JJK|1.0|LAN card died after two days.<br /><br />I'm a 20 year it pro.  This is the third board from gigabyte that has been a disaster. Fourth including a replacement for number two.<br /><br />I keep trying it due to the tonymac guides.  They keep sucking.<br /><br />Get something else and take the time to make a dsdt. It's easy enough now with auto patches.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|For people who grew up in the Star Trek/Star Wars era, this is perhaps one of the most brilliant movies ever.<br /><br />With one of the best lines ever: &#34;By Grabthar's Hammer, what a savings.&#34;
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun like that i don't have to worry about time frames!  kinda slow going but its fun!  if you like Sim games you will like it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book, keeps you on your toes. I really think this one will reflect your opinion based on your own perspective. I would recommend it! Especially via Kindle, if you don't know what something means just click it and it tells you!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I couldn't get into the movie, maybe because it strayed far enough from the original that I had a hard time following. My opinion may have been different had I not been a fan of or seen the original but I doubt it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read this book right after I finished the first! Easy read and great book! I would recommend to anyone!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I think maybe it was a little underrated so I didn't expect much going in and typically don't expect much from sequels anyway. I was pleasantly surprised.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|In my opinion this book was the best of all three. Easy read and ended in a way that didn't make you think.....ugh I cannot believe they just left me hanging like that!!
B00417HV14|5.0|Joe's dream to play in Royal Albert Hall after seeing Clapton when he was a kid and then to play with Eric there is a great story.  The music is great as well.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Its kind of a cute movie, but not one that I would purchase or watch again.  Its a decent time waster.
0316223239|5.0|I literally cried in one part and laughed out loud on a few parts where Jack is talking in his head. He is an adorable chracter and she did a GREAT job creating this book and its world. I was sad when it was over.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|Cannot wait for season 4. This is a MASTER PIECE since GONE with WIND and Ten Commandments ! I love everything about this downton abbey.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|This movie was terrible.  I only watched it because it was my husbands night to choose our movie.  The language and humor was awful.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I  think that it's so much better now that it has armor and signs, l enjoy minecraft pocket edition is a lot better now .
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book the ending surprised me I can't wait until I read the next book yay to the best book
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This is a wonderfully produced movie - of course from Stephen Spielberg.  Very heart wrenching and moving.  Would recomment to anyone who likes this type of moving story line.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really loved this story. It was so moving and I couldn't put it down. Do yourself a favor and read this amazing book with a box of tissue at your side.
B005OCFGTO|2.0|So upset ... the DVD inside casing arrived broken, disks still played well, so thats all that matters I guess. Otherwise it would have been 5 star. Love HP!
B00846F1YW|5.0|I didn't have any problems with this on my kindle fire. The only issue was that I didn't want to put it down once I started playing it...I wanted to keep going until I'd solved all the puzzles. Thanks for a great game!
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of 2012! It is such a good coming-of-age movie. I first watched it not knowing what it was about but was pleasantly surprised on how deep it is. Plus it has a great soundtrack!
145551389X|3.0|Like the title says. I was just in Dollarama and saw this book for sale for five dollars. What a crappy thing to find that there when I just spent like $40 on it or something like that.<br /><br />Nice book though!<br />Just was P O'd to see it at Dollarama. So the book is a five star!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I actually saw this movie in the theater twice - once with my daughter and once with my youngest son. Like [[ASIN:B003UESJFG Megamind (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]], this movie is really funny, and there are plenty of jokes that will fly over the younger kids' heads but will make the parents laugh out loud. All of the humor is clean, and as long as you aren't concerned with your kids being entertained by cartoony monsters (including all of the classics, like vampires, mummies, zombies, werewolves, Frankenstein, gremlins, skeletons, etc), this one is family friendly. I really enjoyed it and ordered it as soon as it became available. This is definitely one of Adam Sandler's best movies!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is a book for any fan of zombies or sci-fi apocalypse storytelling. I definitely recommend reading the book before seeing the movie because the format of the book is so unique. This book should not be missed.
B009YU7J9C|5.0|The CD and video are exceptional.  This group still can bring the goods.  A lot of talent is on display here
B00APJLX8E|4.0|Well made movie.  Great for kids my 3 yr old enjoyed it and wasn't scared of the monsters.  Actually sat down and watched it three times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book! Keeps you wanting to know more. Absolutely must read ! I can't wait until they make the second movie !
B008RXYOKY|4.0|This hard drive is good for connecting a single Firewire drive to a Thunderbolt drive. An important part of my weekly workflow is connecting multiple Firewire drives to a single firewire port. This adaptor isn't able to provide sufficient power for two G-Drive Mini drives, though I suspect that to be a limitation of the Thunderbolt port, not the adapter. This adapter allows me to connect three Firewire drives to my computer (two over the native FW port and one over Thunder with the adapter) but the power limitations do disappoint.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Blackbird is excellent ...<br /><br />Spend more time listening...Less time with chatter. THIS IS MUSIC...Best I have heard in quite some time.<br /><br />Watch Over You is epic...Thank You, Alter Bridge...<br /><br />Keep it coming, fellas...
B00000IQW5|5.0|this movie has always been a favorite, heartwarming and made me realize love is precious and special, don't take it for granted
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this season was full of surprises, the death of Sybil was a tragedy but at the season end the death of Mathew made me not want to watch it anymore. It may take me a while to get over it. I just don't know if I will watch another episode.
B000LF4BZE|5.0|Me llego en plenas condiciones y en un estado mejor que nuevo! Muchas gracias!! Desde Argentina. Perfecto el disco en vivo.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|i usually love this app but something is wrong. the videos are not loading. it keeps forceclosing.i'm very upset please fix this problem.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome horse game! I wish you could actually control your riding though, but it's still awesome!<br /><br />I'm KelpHead on here! :)
B00A0A59IS|5.0|One Direction know how to create some great songs. I like most of their album except two or three songs. One thing I think is very effective is how I brought the album and download all from my phone. Good thing to because I was walking to class and wanted to hear it.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I love everything about my new cover. Looked at lots even before ordering. Compared to what I had seen, this one is not only priced right, but of great quality and very convenient.
B000V69900|4.0|John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers wrote and performed milestone music in the sixties  Their influence on many fledgling artists was pronounced.  Established artists were given an extra boost to their careers being associated with John and the other outstanding musicians that were part of the Bluesbreakers experience
B0061QD88S|5.0|Excellent service! Thank you, This was a wonderful addition to my Disney Collection. I will enjoy watching it with my granddaughters
0765325950|5.0|I am looking forward to reading it this book, but I have to read Towers of Midnight first.  I wish the author was able to have finished the series himself.
B004JP5DHW|5.0|Sentimental movie, excellent performances, tissues mandatory!  One or two silly moments (Jeff Goldblum beams ALOT) but a great story - preteen and above will enjoy this movie.
B004E9SU14|5.0|Kinda drags in the middle, but nonetheless, it's a fun album.  Good modern mod music, and you can't really go wrong with it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|A really good app to see (and download) YouTube material to your phone. I never understood why it took so long for a YouTube video to buffer in my phone, it take ages in my  Android and in the Blackberry I had, most of the times it was not worth the waiting. With this app you can see the video very quickly, particularly if you do not select the HD option (which, of course, is better if you are going to save the video to play it offline). Only to major setbacks: 1) a lot of adds, mostly of phone enhancement products (but, hey, the app is free version, what could I expect); 2) It crashes often (but can be restarted right away, so no such a big deal either)

B001I82RVS|5.0|B movies are always great, but especially when done well like this. Yeah it was disgusting and disturbing just for the sake of being so but a rare thing occurred. I was actually invested in the movie. It was a very unique version of a dystopian future where cutting yourself is FUN! This was a great movie to add to the collection, buy it already.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|This app is very useful. As a matter of fact, since I installed it in my phone, I rarely use my Kindle. But, there is a problem with the Synchronization tool of the Kindle software. Many electronic books use end notes in their texts, instead of footnotes. I mean, the not in the same page were the noted text is, but at the end of the chapter or even the end of the book. Of course, when reading on the same device,  is usually quite easy to get back to the text. But when you open the book with another device, the Sync tool understand as the last page read that of the end note. I hope it is something wrong I'm doing or there is any way to avoid this. If so, I'll appreciate the advice of anyone reading this; if not, it is quite a pain.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|Infinite amount of alarms and alternatives to keep record of time passing and deadlines closing on. Something that proves itself to me to be harder than differential equations and quantum mechanics physics (and I've studied both, believe me).
B00AWTTUHI|3.0|An animated work that carefully follows a pictoral storytelling masterpiece has a pre-advantage.  And therein lies a problem: the original was writtin in the 80's for an audience in the 80s.  That's not a flaw, that's a statement of fact.  That the book is considered a classic with its thirty year old setting is a feature not a bug; it is a testament to its originality at the time.  Transfering the story to a later era, while leaving to much of the older era in place (or without a sufficient storytelling explanation in Part 1 that this version takes place in the eighties as well) suggests a lack of either convictional courage or honest creativity.  This was not a problem in Part 1.  It seems to be a problem in Part 2.  The most jarring example of this was keeping Reagan as the president in this version.  Substituting the current president into the story would've given the writers a change to show their courage and creativity.  Batman's liberterian streak as presented in the animated retelling would be more at odds with the current president than the one at the time the book was written.  Also, current events with Russia and/or other developing nuclear powers would not have constrained the nuclear problem tot he Soviet Union.<br /><br />We also have a few minor applause and boos.  Regarding the voice talent, casting Conan O'Brien as the David Letterman type was pretty slick.  Bravo, Ms. Romano.  We're a tad disappointed some more recognizable names weren't in the rest of the cast (as was done in, say Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths).  Animation design of Batman was a good recreation of the original, but making Jim Gordon look hautingly Japanese was not.<br /><br />Buy or not?  Hey, you bought Part 1, so....
B00B5HQL50|5.0|'Skyfall' beside the luscious music was one of my favorite Bond films. Daniel Craig has had to prove himself Bond worthy, and, now there is no reason not to hand him the mantle.<br /><br />The film opens with Bond engaged in one dangerous locale after another. This is the start of something big right away. And,almost 20 mins in we are supposed to believe that Bond is taken out, no I don't think so. The decision to shoot Bond was made by M, played by the brillant Dame Judi Dench. She had no real choice, Bond was being used as a human shield, a split decision made by M. She was called on the carpet by Mallory,  played by Ralph Fiennes, her new boss in MI6. She was writing Bond's obituary as she was herself was learning hers. Though M is not ready to retire, and,this film is hers as much as it is Bond's. M is a figure to revere and to love.<br /><br />Javier Bardem, plays Silva, a bleached blonde computer wizard, and as he put Bond through his paces, I was reminded of the early days of 007, and how much he has become a part of our culture. Not just the Bond women, but the old timers like Judi Dench and those who have come and gone. We end up in Kincade's Scottish mansion. Albert Finney another oldie but goodie has things to say and places to go. And, the beautiful Aston Martin makes a reappearance.  Not ready to say goid-bye, not at all.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 04-04-14

B00B5HQLMI|4.0|This movie is a worthy addition to the Daniel Craig Bond era - full of action in exotic settings, gorgeous women,explosions, and many a shout out to the Bond canon. Try to spot the numerous references in the movie - some in plain sight while others are a little more elusive. I enjoyed this movie and would recommend to both casual and more hardcore Bond fans.
B006XOBFJC|5.0|I have several ring cycles including Solti, Karajan, Levine, Bohm and Keilberth/Furtwangler. I like them all for different reasons. I bought the Janowski since it's a huge bargain and I was very pleased with the sound and singing. Other reviewers have extolled the virtues of the tenors, KOLLO, SCHREIER and JERUSALEM. To my ears, they are simply the best three tenors in ALL the ring cycles. Incredible!  The two basses, MOLL and SALMINEN are also tops in their roles. The ladies are good but I prefer those in the other rings. Theo Adam is OK but not up to the Wotans in the classic rings.<br />Janowski and the Staatskapelle Dresden sound great. While they may not have the beautiful sound of the Berlin Philharmonic or Vienna, they are conducted with intelligence by Janowski and recorded in marvelous digital sound which allows Wagner's orchestral writing to be clearly heard.<br />If you haven't bought a Ring Cycle yet, you will be very pleased with this set. I suggest that you spend an extra ten or fifteen bucks and get the latest packaging with the individual boxes containing librettos . The English translation is the Stewart Spencer which costs about twenty bucks if you purchase it as a separate book.<br /><br />In summary, snap this up quickly but get the latest deluxe packaging for about fifty bucks.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was impressed with this story, not only because if the way the author wrote it, but with how real the characters were. I could relate to them and I could find myself rooting for many of the characters.  The author does an incredible job at depicting humanity at its worst, as well as the balance and the true psychology behind those experiences.  Beautifully written, depicted, and portrayed, this book has brought me to tears a few times.<br /><br />With the way governments have been acting lately, it is a good reminder to us that we are each individually free... And that nobody can ever take away our humanity.

B009A87X80|5.0|Since I first heard her rendition of Over The Rainbow, I was hooked. I now own every cd, and even burned my own version of \\"favorites\\" which is almost identical to The Best Of. I wish I would have been able to hear her preform live. This is most definitely five star.

B005J4TLN4|5.0|The characters are believable, and you will care about the central figures well before the end of the movie.  It's scary, it's funny, it's exciting.  Watch it alone, then watch it with friends.  Watch it.<br /><br />This is a low-budget movie, and the low-budget feel is used very much to advantage.  It has an immediate, \\"real\\" feel that big-budget slickness doesn't usually achieve.

0307592731|3.0|I immediately was hooked as I began reading, but the author droned on way to much about her sad life. Where was the love and passion for the beautiful scenery she hiked over.

Very little was written about the beauty of the hike!<br /><br />I'm glad she seemed to have grown from the experience at the end. To hike this trail by herself is pretty amazing!

B000002KDO|5.0|Though much has been written about Black Sabbath's eponymous debut and the ground-breaking \\"Paranoid\\" that followed in its wake, not enough has been mentioned of the group's third effort. In just a short period of time, the group had created a genre unto themselves and as evidenced by the sheer sonic strength and tightness of \\"Master Of Reality,\\" the British quartet were truly masters of their own craft, inventing heavy metal as they went along while paying tribute to their influences along the way.<br /><br />With the strings on axeman Tony Iommi's frets down-tuned to the bowels of Hell, Black Sabbath pump out the sludgiest and heaviest album of their career, laying the groundwork for generations of heavy metal groups to follow. \\"Master Of Reality\\" may lack the hits delivered by \\"Paranoid,\\" but more than compensates by delivering a solid eight song set (six if you discount the melodic interludes) that remains a force to be reckoned with more than forty years after its original release.<br /><br />The album opens with a jarring cough before spilling open with one of Iommi's most memorable grooves in \\"Sweet Leaf.\\" With this song alone, the stoner-metal genre is born. Deeper cuts such as \\"After Forever\\" seem designed almost as a way of competing with the grandiosity of Led Zeppelin, while the unrelenting rhythm of \\"Children of the Grave\\" and the dirge-rock of \\"Into The Void\\" only serve to further augment the band's signature style. Perhaps the album's greatest surprise lies in \\"Solitude,\\" a somber number that finds Ozzy singing in an entirely different key while the band provides sparse instrumentation. If nothing else, pick up a copy of this album for this little oddity alone.<br /><br />Even though the genre has pretty much been done to death at this point, \\"Master Of Reality\\" still retains a certain vitality and immediacy that all truly classic pieces possess. It may not be the most beloved of Sabbath releases, but it's still essential listening and truly compelling all the same. Though the band would go off the creative deep end in later years, this album serves as proof that it is possible to break new ground musically while honoring the past. No collection of hard rock/metal/whatever is complete without a copy of \\"Master Of Reality\\" among it.g all the same.

B000N2HBSO|4.0|I have not finished the book as yet but am enjoying reading it. It's well written and very informative. It has proven to be very inciteful of the times and tribulations of Abraham Lincoln.  I look forwards to seeing the movie that has been nominated for an Academy Award.
B009YU9J0E|3.0|Crystal Castles have adopted a more somber tone with (III) than on previous efforts. Gone is the sense of chaos that permeated (I) or the drama and trauma of (II), but with (III) they appear to have adopted a more mature world outlook and approach the subject matter with a great sense of empathy. Musically, there are hints of Crystal Castles as presented on (II) - especially on the track appearing on the latter half of the recording. Don't think this album will win any new fans and fans of their previous efforts can expect to give it a few listens before warming up to it. I'd grade this a 'C' for average - it just doesn't exceed expectations.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Hugh Howey's Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5) (Silo Saga). Mr. Howey is truly a talented writer. The title, \\"Wool\\" caught my attention. Why would a book be titled \\"Wool\\"? Reading this book soon explains the title.<br /><br />Mr. Howey's Silo universe triggers memories of Zion, the underground city<br />portrayed in the last two Matrix films. Also, Wool brings to mind the<br />world of Logan's Run, a dystopian society where everyone needs to be killed by the age of thirty.<br /><br />Wool brings up interesting questions: How do you ensure the future of humanity in underground silos where resources and space are limited? Can there be a democracy or only a dictatorship in this environment? What caused the human race to go underground in the first place?<br /><br />I strongly recommend Hugh Howey's Silo (Wool) series. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Howey's books.

B00AS1Q93S|4.0|While it is far from a perfect movie, \\"Jack Reacher\\" is an ok action flick. It's got a great car chase, some impressive shots of Pittsburgh and a decent amount of action, suspense and one-liners.<br />I have never read the book(s?), so I don't if this is a fair adaptation, but I thought it was good enough to catch as a matinee in theaters, and I may even buy it used in a couple of months.<br />3.5 stars is a fair rating for this film. What you see is what you get.

You will be doing yourself a disservice, however, if you do not complete more of a cool-down than is allotted on this video. If I have any complaint about the video it's that a lot of the exercises involve high-impact, which is not good for my slightly damaged middle-aged body. In most cases, although not all, she offers alternatives to the high-impact version, but they do not offer the same cardio intensity.

B003L20IJM|3.0|This film was enjoyable but I was a little disappointed. It was not as good as the first film perhaps they tried to stay close to the first film's story line.

B0086213XW|4.0|The movie has a sense of clarity and is recommended for people who are stuck between romance and fantasy.<br />I think that almost anything is likely to pursue a candidate who seems interesting in them with adoration and adulation.<br />In reality I think that both men and women have these fantasies.<br />Culturally, some groups are more likely to get caught up in the emotion and stray from their marriage.<br />The new becomes old and it really doesn't take that long.<br />People have issues that they need to work out and they tend to mess up other peoples lives when the<br />shake the foundation of their own marriage for this fantasy...always searching for Mr. Right and not settling for Mr. Right now can provoke a hopeless romantic to keep a string of men/women jumping from one to the next.....crazy, selfish and bold.
B002ZG997C|4.0|73 reviewers made this comment: \\"Eli gives the world, once again, the Bible.\\" Now keep in mind the entire world was just destroyed by a nuclear holocaust because of the BS in that book. And after the nuclear holocaust humans burned every KJ bible they could locate to prevent such madness from repeating itself. So why in the world would it be so dammed important to do it all again? Stupid humans obviously do not learn from their mistakes! Denzel plays a great part well acted but will now be to blame for round two of human stupidity. The warlord should have shot him in the head. Problem solved! At least in movie it would have been problem solved.

B0064W67IM|5.0|I never read Neil Gaimans Sandman when it first came out. A friend introduced me to volume one and I was lost for good. The story of Dream and his siblings, all I can say without spoilers is: Go. Go forth and read all of the volumes. You. Will. Not. Be. Disappointed.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed the first four Die Hard movies, so we didn't have to think much about seeing number 5 - \\"A Good Day to Die Hard.\\" It's been twenty-five years since the first \\"Die Hard,\\" but Bruce Willis is still up to playing John McClane in another nonstop action film. In my opinion, A Good Day to Die Hard is as entertaining as any of the first four in the series, if for no other reason than a chase scene that rivals the classic chase scenes in films like The French Connection, Bullitt, Terminator 3, and The Matrix: Reloaded. It's a humdinger, with more vehicles being destroyed than I could count.<br /><br />Even approaching sixty years old, Willis is still marvelous at playing the role of NYPD detective John McClane. This time, we meet his son John Jr., played by Jai Courtney. When Junior, a CIA agent, is arrested in Russia, John Sr. flies to Moscow to help him. As John Sr. approaches the courthouse where Junior is testifying as a witness in a criminal trial, all hell breaks loose, and soon both of the McClanes and a Russian, Yuri Komarov, are on the run, first to escape the bad guys, then on an unlikely and perilous trip to Chernobyl to foil the bad guys' plot. Yuliya Snigir adds some eye candy to the film, but it's basically a fast-paced good-guys-versus-the-bad-guys story with no romantic interludes to slow down the action. The climactic scene involving a Russian Mi-24 attack helicopter is as spectacular as any scene in the Die Hard series.<br /><br />The bottom line: After five episodes, the Die Hard franchise is still in great shape. No, it may not be great drama or high cinematic art, but it's entertaining enough to fill up the movie theaters for a few weeks. Hopefully, the producers are already planning number six, and if so, will it be a reprise of John Sr. and John Jr. working together?

B005IEF27O|5.0|Well I was really hesitant to buy this album, I loved Primus in the 90's and 00's but I was turned off from them by Les Claypools solo hippie styled albums. Boy am I glad I bought this. This album reminds me of a mixture of Frizzle Fry, Pork Soda and AntiPop. It has the &#34;classic&#34; Primus sound I love without any songs sounding like a redo of older material.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|While it still had aspects of the original, which would have easily tied it to a sequel, it strayed to far from the first to be a remake. The cast, special effects etc were all good. All around it was very entertaining but if your hoping for an up to date remake you'll be disappointed.
030758836X|2.0|I will cease reading &#34;critic's reviews&#34; after reading all the glowing reviews for this book and believing them.  I have not read a book I disliked this much in a long time.  I finished the book and said &#34;Thank God that's over&#34;. Unbelievable and unlikeable characters with ridiculous stereotypes.  &#34;Sophisticated snobby New Yorker&#34;. &#34;Hickish uncultured Midwesterners&#34;.  Gee there's a new literary cliche.  Can't wait for Hollywood to make a crappy movie of this crappy book!
0525423281|4.0|The Gist:<br />See title.<br /><br />Fist Lines:<br />I have three simple wishes. They're not too much to ask.<br /><br />The First is to attend the winter formal dressed like Marie Antoinette. I want a wig so elaborate it could cage a bird and a dress so wide I'll only be able to enter the dance through a set of double doors. But I'll hold my skirts high as I arrive to reveal a pair of combat  boots, so everyone can see that, underneath the frills, I'm punk-rock tough.<br /><br />Our Hero:<br />Lola, or Dolores as nobody calls her, is an adorable, funny, 17-year-old girl living in San Francisco with her two dads. She has an extensive wardrobe, much of it vintage or handmade. She's a little immature, though maybe it just seems that way because her boyfriend, Max, is a 22-year-old musician, which nobody thinks is a good idea. She has always had a thing for her neighbor Cricket Bell, whose family has just moved back to town. Lola and Cricket are super-cute together. I needed them to kiss.<br /><br />Love/Hate:<br />I've never been a fan of reading descriptions of fashion. Even when a friend describes a dress to me, when I see it in never looks like I'd imagined. But Lola's outfits and costumes are a major part of who her character is. So I really felt like I was missing something. And because the other characters tease her for her crazy outfits, I always picture them looking pretty silly. So despite everything I never managed to have much faith in Lola's fashion sense.<br /><br />When I Cried:<br />Near the end, there's a scene when Cricket's sister, Calliope, a figure skater, is fighting to place at a national competition. She's kind of cold and mean for the entire book, but somehow by this point you're totally rooting for her. She manages to pull off a flawless routine, and there you have it--sob fest. Sports movies have always made me cry, but figure skating? Well, that's a new one for me.
0765325950|1.0|This won't stop you from reading this last book in the series, and it shouldn't anyway. If you're going to read this book, it means you read all the others -- like me. It's been a long road, but the series has come to a disappointing end. Not entirely this new author's fault since he's, well, the new author in a series that has gone on way too long. Specific to this book, the chapters seem to drag with the same battle scene or idea continuing on and on. This book could have been 600 pages shorter and made all the same points, tied up all the same loose ends, that this much longer version did. The end was trite, the action was rehashed, and this book crossed the line as a wheezing geezer way past his/her prime. It really had no business being the in the race in the first place. As much as I would have hated to leave the series hanging open-ended with the death of the original author, it probably would have been better that way. Enjoy!
B00004CY38|1.0|This movie didnt work once I received it. I waited a few weeks to receive it and after I did it wouldn't play in any DVD player that I had inside the house. I didn't pay much for the item but was still very disappointed!!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I think this is a good, clean book for younger readers who enjoy fantasy.  While the story is ok, it's kind of dumbied down. The author takes too much time to explain something that didn't really need explaining in the first place. She explains the main character's feelings way too much. A simple \\"Thor finally felt accepted\\" would suffice instead of going on and on about how he felt apart of the group and how happy he was. EVERYTIME another boy accepted him. I don't know how anyone can campare it to great works such as Tolkien. My main complaint is that whoever did the kindle format did not proof read at all. There are so many grammtical errors and wrong names through out the book. It's like the person didn't really care what was going on and just started throwing in random names from the character list.
B005LAII80|5.0|While I've seen many people claim that the movie isn't good, I object. It is a great movie! First, I was worried that it would be all exactly the same as with Judge Dredd from 1995, but the movie proved me wrong. It has nothing to do with the 1995 movie except for judges, and Dredd himself. The movie could go both ways: like it did with Dredd as main character, again or with another character by another name. Anyways I loved the main characters and rookie was quite awesome as well. That said, I've seen ''the Raid'' and I don't really care if they took ''fighting in the locked building'' from that movie. I didn't like the Raid for its violence and sadism. I think the movie could be so much better if we had a bigger world to explore, but none the less I enjoyed the movie so much. What I disliked in the movie is slow-motion. It wasn't used too much, or all the time, but it got me bored with it, even though I could see all of the details. As my title for the review says, I would love to see a trilogy for Dredd! Awesome movie that does not contradict the 1995 version nor does it replace that version of the movie. Cool, I loved it!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I usually hate gory shows, but this one is so good and captures your attention so well that I can't stop watching.  After watching the first two seasons on Netflix, I had to buy the episodes from Amazon to catch me up with what's available on demand on AMC and then start watching the current ones on AMC.  I recommend anyone with Netflix watch just one episode, I guarentee they will keep watching.
B000002J1S|2.0|I received the import version today, and the mixing is more mono than stereo, and you have to turn up the volume to simply hear it. On the back of the CD, it says Definitive Edition Remaster, but the sound quality is, as I've mentioned, poor. Also, on the back, where it claims to be a Definitive Edition Remaster, it lists all the band members except Peter Gabariel -- which is a bit odd, as this was his last album with Genesis.<br />The U.S. version does list Gabriel, which is one way of telling this is the real thing. Don't get the Argentina version, as it is not worth your money.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|UGHHHHHHHHHH  Really......... MIB back in time ....Hmmmmm  guess Hollywood ran out of stupid twilight films wow thanks for this I really appreciated it
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Fantastic Show.... we hadnt watched to first two seasons on PBS. But we certainly watched this season. We have passed the DVD set onto our children...all of whom have become great fans of the Crawley family.
B001OQCV2O|1.0|Where do I began with this steaming pile of movie, Pretty stupid premise accompanied by a severely drawn out climax that was more unentertaining than watching films from the silent era  not only did I not enjoy this movie but lets think about it for a second this movie was actually soo bad that I took a break from shopping on Amazon when I saw this movie pop up and decided I would actually dedicate about five minutes of my time to protest my disdain for not only the acting but the short sided directing, Hiking commercial inspired  principal photography and complete lack of dialogue. In conclusion this movie does achieve one of its sought after goals if the singular message to be taken from this film was to warn  people of mankinds destructive nature and how abuse of our most invaluable resource is ultimately going to lead to our demise than a prime example has been made. Directors with too much clout still have the ability to garner alot of money from studios and produce  abortions to the art form of cinema which will hopefully lead to them not being allowed to make movies anymore. (Facepalm)
B005LAJ17M|5.0|We loved the program... although we found the dvd a little frustrating to use. We are awaiting the second season dvd set.. where is it..
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Well I love this game this should be like 10 dollars.You don't have to press save it saves by its self.Better then the barman one it has free play I haven't played barman though.You need to get this!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I couldn't love a series more.  I can't wait until next season.  I have<br />been drawn into this families adventures and there is no escape!<br />Bravo....
B004SBS8LA|4.0|When you want to play and not think too hard. It takes some thinking but great if you are a temporary mental blob
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had to limit my viewing time to keep the anticipation of what happens next<br />under control so that I could savor each episode.  This is the best series ever.<br />I feel as though I am a member of this family and the emotions flow easily as I watch<br />each episode.  I have watched through Season 3 and can not wait for next<br />season!  Excellent, excellent, excellent....
B003INBOE2|1.0|Like many here, my blu-ray copy of IP Man freezes at the menu screen.  For some blu-ray players you can get the disc to play at the frozen menu by pressing 000 on your remote and hitting enter.  For other blu-ray players, press 001 and hit enter at the frozen menu.  This is how I got my disc to play.<br /><br />The one star review is for the frozen men (people shouldn't have to figure out cryptic remote combinations to get their disc to work).  Also, the one star is for the unskipable previews.<br /><br />The movie itself is five stars.
0385535147|5.0|I used to read all Grisham novels in the past and enjoyed a lot most of them. I liked the movies based on his novels too, in fact, they are still my favorites. I listened to the audio of his Racketeer novel to the very end and found it, as usual, a very good narrative, a fun filled story that one can enjoy reading or listening to at home or on the beach. Grisham is a very good story teller, probably one of the finest, at least in my genre of thrillers. He deserves to be read.<br /><br />Steven Nedelton<br />Author of Dangerous Trade

0061353248|5.0|...and relearn it all, alongside this book. :)<br /><br />Counter-intuitive at many turns and many angles, Predictably Irrational shows how standard economic theory crumbles under even cursory analysis (as Ariely aptly demonstrates through his many varied, entertaining and creative experiments). He begins with a personal anecdote - being treated for severe burns over several months at a hospital. Despite the most laudable intentions possessed by his carers, he felt as though their methods of soaking him in a solution and pasting him with artificial skin daily could be improved. As it turned out, the nurses believed, erroneously, that aiming to complete arduously unpleasant (to put it mildly) procedures as though one were running a 100-metre sprint would be better for patients overall. This intuition was disproved by one of the author's own studies. Dragging out treatments over a more protracted period, but with lower ceilings of pain, were more tolerable to patients. From the nurses' viewpoint, speedier bandage removal would be rational if their goal was to treat as many patients as possible in a given day (or as the author bluntly put it, to reduce their own suffering). By combining the interests of all stakeholders, we can come across an optimal AND rational solution that considers the needs and wants of all parties.<br /><br />As just one example, economists have begun using a Happiness Index in addition to GDP and GNP to evaluate and rank countries on prosperity.<br /><br />Chapter One mentions a frequently employed marketing ploy - relativity. Using a subscription to the Economist, Dan enlisted his students in an experiment. Given the three options on the website (a 12-month, online-only subscription for $59, a print-only option for $125, or both for $125), which would they choose? Notably, the print-only subscription is the only option that does not give subscribers access to a back-catalog of articles. Needless to say, the print-only version was a decoy, butwith it present, 84% chose the bundled subscription (None were mathematically illiterate enough to pick the decoy). But with the decoy out of the equation, the spread went in the opposite direction, with over two-thirds going for the online-only option (Personally, I would have chosen the online subscription and printed out any articles that caught my fancy. Staring at screens for extended periods tend to make me bored and disoriented, unless I'm gaming).<br /><br />The lesson here is that having things to compare makes decision-making easier. If we are shown two sandwiches that look almost identical, making what should be a simple meal choice can become agonising. But if one sandwich is on processed white bread and another is on rye, we tend to focus on the differences, and use those to streamline our analysis.<br /><br />The lessons and empirical data gleaned from one chapter are often applicable to others (as well as other aspects in life that we may not have considered before reading this book). Sometimes, the fear of loss takes hold and we end up with less (as was demonstrated by offering $10 Amazon certificates for free versus $20 certificates for $7). At others, our amygdala takes hold and we revert to primal, carnal states. As more empirical research into behavioural economics (what actually happens, and why we do certain things) rolls in, the more informed we will be about our innermost workings.<br /><br />As a side note, I have taken to supplementing my alcoholic beverages with balsamic vinegar. :)<br /><br />Always enlightening and never dull, Predictably Irrational deserves a spot on every middle and high school bookshelf.
B004E0Z4XK|4.0|Listening to Rome, I felt like I was just eating a delicious appetizer and never made it to the main course, let alone dessert. The problem with the album is that, while the music is everything I hoped it would be - namely, a resurrection of Italian spaghetti western scores adapted to into pop songs - there really isn't that much music here. Clocking in at just over half an hour, it seems like half the album is made up of instrumental versions of the six songs that Norah Jones and Jack White appear on. Granted, the music here is great and all scores repeat musical motifs, yet I felt like I was waiting for a climax that never came. The ideas here are fleshed out, but there aren't all that many of them. It's a good album, but it's not a great album. For the main course, I'd recommend picking up the incredible [[ASIN:B002BAFIP4 Ennio Morricone Gold Edition - 50 Movie Themes Hits]]. For dessert, I highly recommend Mike Patton's [[ASIN:B003FD4ZIW Mondo Cane]].
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive. I couldn't stop playing it after I got it. Even my mom played it when she started playing.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|When I originally tried to upload this game, something went wrong and the app would not load on my Kindle and I bitched about it here. Since them, the problem (I still don't know what it was) righted and now I have the app. That said, I ran through this game within a day. Most of the levels are easy, a few required do overs. What was adorable were the characters, the new birds (one had a light saber and another could engulf things in a bubble and when it burst, the item fell on whatever was below) Overall, I love playing Angry Birds. I just wish this were more levels in this version. But for $2.99 what do you expect?
B000001FYL|5.0|I chose 5 stars because Jon and the band are great at all the albums. I love he writes and performs his own songs.

B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I have played this game for over 20 years. This app is very satisfying to play and user friendly.  It's well worth the price and intuitive in use.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Good quality, there was no problem with the DVD. The order came in very quickly and it was a very great gift.
B00B01XDTI|1.0|Pacing is bad, direction is bad, acting is bad, everything is bad. If you were a fan of Silent Hill 3 I feel bad for you, as this exists and forever will tarnish the name of said game for simply existing.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I don't play the game personally my grandson does and he loves it. If you have younger kids who will be using your kindle fire I would recommend the game for them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Keeps you guessing at the end of each chapter!! I am happy that Christian found his happy ever after. I am sad it's over
B0086700CM|4.0|I got this and its not an easy game and I would recommend getting this one before getting the second one as it helps teach you how to play the game and the best part is its free. My grandson played it and loves it and I play it to we share so I would recommend it if you like interactive games it is a challenge for sure.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This one kept my page-turning speed up! He included some review of incidents from previous books which is always helpful.  It was a great one for a 12 hour plane trip!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. I can get lost in it for hours its so easy to use and has so many ideas this is the best thing the kindle could have to help me wait in a doctors office or in my living room. I love it
1449433251|5.0|Even though I have been fully grown for many many years, I still enjoy good humor and comics. A lot of joy left my life when Calvin and Hobbes quit. I am now reviewing and reliving all that joy and can't believe I missed so many of them.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love the color purple. I had originally purchased a different type of case that didn't fit my kindle fire when I contacted amazon the lady that helped me out was just so wonderful I cant say enough of how kind and helpful she was to me. I along with her assistance picked this new case out and received it in less than 3 days time and it works great. I would recommend this case to anyone who has a kindle fire and loves the color purple. This experience with amazon makes me feel comfortable knowing when I purchase items online I will be taken care of and they care about their customers and making sure they get what they want so as to come back and shop well they get my vote I will be back.
1935670913|4.0|I read this book in two sittings. For writers, it’s a clear message of how we can beat the system (mainstream publishing). For others, it’s a lesson in manipulating massive websites like Amazon. The concept is simple but the execution a little tougher–not the Amazon or even the Twitter part… but the writing several novels to have ready for sale: good novels.<br /><br />It’s also a brief insight into the brilliant mind of John Locke, self-made millionaire–before he started writing–and best-selling self-published author. He has a refreshing voice and it sounds like he’s not a lot unlike Donovan Creed, though I doubt he kills people on the side.<br /><br />For any aspiring writer worried about marketing, it’s a must read!
B003B02O0A|3.0|A shocking account of a very graphically violent tragedy. Food for thought in a world gone mad with racism. Not sure of my feelings about the violence.
B008CRC506|5.0|Great show and great DVD! I love this show and will order season  2 when it is avalable.<br /><br />Tips!  watch season one and then season two.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is very enjoyable. I always wanted a horse but never could in real life. I enjoy taking car of my horse Beauty :)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is great and addictive I would recommend  this book to anyone in seventh grade and older. Great read.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really liked this book with it being the first one I have ever read by Charleston period. Some parts were repetitive when it come to love scenes. I do recommend this book though!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I'd recommend it to everyone! You need to look something up.....& BOOM...There it is!  It makes searching for something extremely easy. I LOVE IT!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so awesome I have lots of highscores on there. buy it you'll love it woohoo best game ever! ok buy it now.
B000WC4A8O|5.0|I was so excited to receive this box set. I had seen the size and weight of it, and it made me happy. So when the day came that it was expected to arrive, I was practically waiting by the door for it. When it finally arrived, I was so gleeful, I just couldn't wait to open it. I scurried my way through the package to the box set itself. When I got through the outer plastic, I slowly took the top off of it. What did I find? BUBBLE WRAP! That's right, boys and girls, there is a layer of bubble wrap, so you can have at it. Then after the bubble wrap, there is a nice 20-page booklet about the band themsleves with some neat little pictures. Then you get to the records. The first record sleeve is the face none other than Jimmy Page himself, then the second sleeve is John Paul Jones, the John Bonham on the third, then Robert Plant on the last one. I put on the first record, and the booming sound of \\"Good Times Bad Times\\" was so crisp and perfect. I sat through each record one song at a time until I reached the end of Plant's record. and in between the songs, dead silence.  I have only heard one pop on one record out of all four of the records. Coming from a guy who has original release Zeppelin records, beleive me when I say, this is one amazing box set. I highly suggest this to any Zeppelin fans and vinyl enthusiasts.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|Good app, but forces you to rate it. &quot;Remind me later&quot; or &quot;No thanks&quot; option doesn't do anything when the app asks you to rate it
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A good story kept alive by great imagination, I will read more from this Author.<br />Liked the way it ended,kept the theme well!
B003JQLHY0|4.0|Original review: I got this watch for my husband for Valentine's Day. He was thrilled, and immediately took off the tag that said \\"You cannot return if this tag is removed.\\" It was not until an hour or so later when he set the date that he noticed the day of the week is in Spanish. \\"Lunes\\", etc. Anyway, he is not unhappy enough with it to go through the (attempted) return process, but I am pretty disappointed. Makes me wonder about the legitimacy of the product/company.<br /><br />A kind person pointed out to me that if you keep spinning the dial, you can move past the spanish days to the english version. And so it was.<br /><br />So I adjusted my rating, but I am leaving in the original comment in case someone else runs into this. My husband is still very happy with it, probably mostly because he used to have one like it and it brings back good memories. It seems high quality.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love the author could read over and over and still get chills.<br />This book really touched me and made me really think about how great my life is.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|If you read this as his experience only, it is a wonderful book.  I was looking for a bit more information on what kind of messages were transmitted to him.  I guess he wanted to emphasize that his situation was dire and that there was no way his brain was functioning normally during his obe.  It is inspiring to read.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Exhilarating, joyous, incredible, life sustaining, full of hope and peace. A must read. I plan to share it with everyone.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|I strongly recommend reading iWoz; for someone coming from electronics and computer science background, reading this Bio brought so many memories of my youth back home as well. A sincere, written-from-the-heart book, as only Woz could do.
B00003CX8N|3.0|The movie is based on the book of same title which is a simple assemblage of letters between Helene Hanff in NYC and a book seller in London in he late 1940's and early 1950's.  Although the letters are a charming read, there is not enough to support a film.  It would have been better to watch these three great actors just do a reading of the letters.
B000SL1UEG|5.0|just to see Nicolas Cage when he was a kid is worth the price of the DVD!  And its a wonderful story we've all lived at least a little.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|It may be over 40 years since its release, but it is as impactful and topical as ever.  Liza, Joel Grey, and even Michael York are all perfect in their roles.  Some critics complain that Liza sings too well and acts too well to be Sally Bowles, who was said to be only marginally talented.  But to watch Liza sing and perform, is a sheer joy.<br /><br />Any new viewer to Cabaret should be aware that this is a seriously political movie.  If you can be easily offended by a movie with modern political implications, you might want to skip Cabaret. I would offer my own very political comment, that Cabaret drives home: We should never forget the Nazi era, and how seductive any political movement can be that promises to restore its nation's greatness.  Germany in the 1930s was awash in the idea that the Aryan race was \\"exceptional\\". Remind you of any country today? The scene of the Hilter Youth member singing \\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\\" and the reaction of the German Beer Festival crowd looks eerily like some modern Tea Party rallies.  Never forget - never!<br /><br />About the Blu-ray restoration.  I have both the DVD and Blu-ray versions of Cabaret so I can compare.  Several reviewers have challenged the quality of the Blu-ray.  I cannot comment technically, but I can offer what I see and hear when I watch both DVD and Blu-ray versions on a 60 inch screen and with a very high-end audio system.  There are noticeable differences between the versions when you look at the titles (the Blu-ray's are sharp and defined, where the DVD's are not); this is also true in the outdoor scenes which feature strong vertical and horizontal lines.  However, the indoor scenes, particularly those in the Kit Kat Cabaret, are still grainy in the Blu-ray version.  With respect to the sound, since the music is mostly in the cabaret, it is, by its very nature, tinny sounding - but that's what music sounds like in such a setting.  If you expect the Blu-ray version of Cabaret to be as major a leap aheadas was, say the Blue-ray restoration of Sound of Music, you will be very disappointed.  The Blu-ray version is better than the DVD, in my opinion, but not a major improvement.  Too bad.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the movie is dynamite.  Let go of the technical difficiencies, if you can, and just enjoy the show!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read by Nicholas sparks. I was scared to death that insane Kevin would find Katie and hurt her.  There is the normal love story in the book, but the suspense riveted me to the book. Don't read this book alone, you'll be too scared at the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I didn't expect to be hooked by this series ... but I am.<br /><br />This series is the best of the BBC.  The costumes, sets, locations and everything related to creating a quality period drama are mesmerizing.  The acting is superb and all the more convincing because it is understated (typical of the Brits).<br /><br />What I like best about DA is the realistic peek it gives us into the lives of a noble family AND the lives of their servants, too.  What one of us Americans hasn't seen the castles and huge halls in England and wondered what sort of people once lived there and what type of lives they might have led before the modern era?<br /><br />Now you can find out!  :)
B00B2QA646|2.0|The best I can say is its not horrible.  It's bordering on horrible though.  The story is hard to follow if you don't know the story in advance because the movie is so artsy.  It's filmed partly like a play, which is weird. You could get past that if the dialogue was more clear.<br /><br />I bought this thinking that it would be a movie more along the lines of Pride and Predjudice (which was not unreasonable given that its the same director and actress) and its not at all like that.<br /><br />I'd strongly, strongly recommend NOT getting this movie.  I'm really sorry that I bought it before being able to rent it.  It seemed like a safe bet.<br /><br />In summary, this movie is a real shame.  It could have been really nice.
1451613512|1.0|New York Review of Books: Cherry-Picking Our History by Sean Wilentz &#34;This book is less a work of history than a skewed political document, restating and updating a view of the world that the independent radical Dwight Macdonald once likened to a fog, “caused by the warm winds of the liberal Gulf Stream coming in contact with the Soviet glacier”—but now more than twenty years after the dissolution of the Soviet empire.&#34;

B009NQXXZ6|3.0|I bought this for the music.  I never bought a CD to replace my vinyl record of this, so it had been a long time since I listened to the music.  Re-hearing and seeing Streisand perform &#34;Evergreen&#34; is a treat, as is her performance of &#34;Woman in the Moon&#34; - but the rest of the music was vaguely boring and even a bit irritating at times.  To do over again, I would have been better off downloading the MP3's of the two songs I liked.  If you really want to spend over two hours watching &#34;A Star is Born&#34; I would recommend getting the Judy Garland 1954 musical - lots of great songs and definitely better acting.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't normally like zombies.  However, I find this zombie infested post-apocalyptic world fascinating -- just don't  eat when you watch.<br /><br />The special effects are mind blowing, characterizations realistic and the story line is intriquing.
B0050PYNP8|3.0|My husband had been wanting to see this film ever since he saw the preview of Paul reviving and then eating the bird.  I wish the humor had been this good throughout the movie but in parts it dragged for me.  My husband liked it but his threshold for dumb movies is pretty low; he watches flics That I wouldn't.  He liked Waterworld so that will give you a good idea of his tastes!

B00846F1YW|4.0|Overall, I'm enjoying this game so far -- it has a nice variety of puzzles and I like that it's not timed.<br /><br />The one significant flaw I've found so far is that, in Chapter 10 (I think - it's one of the ones at the hotel), there's an object you're supposed to select, but it's completely hidden behind the top game bar (I only saw the object using the hint button, but then I couldn't tap on it because it went back to being hidden.) I was eventually able to select it by just tapping around the general area a bunch of times, but it was frustrating, and I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to continue on in the game.<br /><br />One thing that I figured out after a while that improved the experience was that you can tap on the dialog to make it advance faster. Also, the folks who said you don't need to post to Facebook or Twitter are right - just x out of that dialog box. You don't need an Internet connection to play this game at all.<br /><br />------<br /><br />Forgot to mention that I'm using a Kindle Fire HD. Also encountered more issues with off-screen objects plus one object that couldn't be tapped without triggering the menu bar to open. HOWEVER, I have found that if you zoom IN a bit (counterintuitively), you can move the image around a bit to get to stuff near the edges.

B0039TAHMA|5.0|Don't miss these movies if you read and liked Tolkien's Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Start with 'The Fellowhip of the Rings' and 'The Two Towers' and finish with 'The Return of the King.'  I promise that you will consider it worth your while.<br /><br />Once in a while a  movie comes along that so faithfully interprets a novel that you gain a whole new understanding of the plot, the characters and the purpose behind the story.  This is such a series and such a movie.<br /><br />A medieval fantasy, TLOTR has it all:  superlative writing, impressive acting, amazing special effects.  Just see it.
B000AP04NI|4.0|I noticed all the bad reviews for this DVD and I have to say, I don't know why it has such horrible reviews? No, the DVD's aren't perfect, although the CinemaScope is beautiful, the color pops, the sound is great, and the overall quality is superb.<br /><br />The main gripe seems to be about the Todd AO version. I didn't know anything about this until I read about it on here and seeing as I didn't have Oklahoma! on DVD yet, I decided to buy the set, horrible reviews aside.<br /><br />I played the Todd AO version in my Blu-Ray player and I have to say, it looked pretty good to me. Not perfect and yes, I think they could have transferred it better, but it is viewable and pleasurable at the same time.<br /><br />This is what I found wrong, in my opinion, with the Todd AO, but it didn't deter me from watching it.<br /><br />1. There is some pulsating of the lighting in the background which your eyes adjust to after awhile and you don't even notice it anymore.<br /><br />2. When they are focusing on an actor/face, the background does appear somewhat blurry, but it's a soft blur, which from an artistic standpoint is sort of pretty.<br /><br />3. The blacks are very, very black. For example, in Judd's cabin, which it is blacks/browns, Curly's head really blends in w/the scenery and the whole scene is very dark w/no depth.<br /><br />4. Many have said that because the Todd AO was filmed in the morning, the actors were more lively, etc. I didn't see this at all. Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRea especially seemed to be nearly identical in both copies of the film. He might have been a little more animated when singing the opening, but not much. Charlotte Greenwood might have danced a tiny bit more lively in \\"The Farmer and the Cowman\\", but only a tad. The only actress I noticed a large difference in acting with was Gloria Grahame \\"Ado Annie\\", she was much more animated in the singing parts and acting in the Todd AO version, especially noticeable during \\"I Can't Say No\\" and \\"All 'Er Nothin'\\". Also, the peddler playing opposite her in the \\"goodbye\\" seen is more lively, he pushes her sleeve up twice and she continues to push it up v the CinemaScope version where he pushes her sleeve up once, it slides down, and they leave it. Small minor detail I happened to notice. Shirley Jones sobs very little in the Todd AO scene after Judd scares her, but quite a lot in the CinemaScope version.<br /><br />I haven't viewed them side by side for every frame, but I plan to, just for fun. I do recommend this set, if you want to own both versions. Play the Todd AO version on a Blu-Ray player and it really isn't that bad. It honestly reminded me of movies that weren't remastered on old VHS tapes and we watched them without complaint. Too me, it's simply nice to have in my collection. Would I buy the Todd AO version again if they release it in better quality, sure, but this is perfectly fine for now. Just enjoy the movie for what it is.'Er Nothin'\\".

B001ANSSDC|5.0|If you only get to read a few books a year, this one needs to be at the top of your list. Matthew Quick has created a Masterpiece.<br />We are introduced to Pat Peoples, a man that has been in a neural health facility for the past few years. The story is told from Pat' s perspective, so the circumstances for him being there are slowly but skillfully revealed over time. We meet and see his family through his eyes. Even though Pat is struggling to get back his life, his observations of his family, friends and even his therapist are quite profound and beautiful at times.<br />I found myself laughing out loud and crying through Pat' s pain and joy.<br />I can not recommend this novel enough! I am so glad I read it, not only did it tell a beautiful story, it caused me to pause and think.....\\"to practice being kind, instead of right\\", Pat told himself that a few times. You don't have to being a mental case to realize that's advice many of us could use.

0439023521|5.0|“Hunger Games” is an unusual and adventurous fictional book written by Suzanne Collins. The author captures her audience’s attention and draws them into this mind blowing adventure where a mystical world is created, forcing you to stay up night and day, craving more. I felt like I was pulled into this fascinating tale, I laughed and cried with the characters, almost hypnotized in a sense.<br /> An authoritarian government, the Capital, displays threats of war unto 12 districts that they hold direct power over. This is the year, of the 74th Hunger Games, where one male and one female from each district between the ages of 12-18 years of age are chosen as a tribute to fight to the death until there is only one remaining survivor. The survivor wins food for his district for one whole year. Prim just turned 12 years old, and is finally able to be thrown in the jar of names for the first time, and miraculously is selected as the female tribute for District 12. Katniss Everdeen, Prim’s older sister, volunteers to take her place in games, not able to bear the thought of her sweet little sister fighting to the death. Peeta Mellark, who turns out to be in love with Katniss, is the male chosen. These two star-crossed lovers are to forced to fight the other district children to the death. Allegiance is found and destroyed as the stronger children team up to kill the weak. Peeta betrays and later saves Katniss, making her confused as to where his loyalty lies. In the end they are the only two children left standing. The rules of the games are changed to allow two tributes from each district to live, vice one.  Peeta and Katniss remain as the last living tributes, when the Gamemakers decide to change the rules back to one living tribute. Peeta and Katniss rebel as they attempted to commit dual suicide, leading to chaos in the Districts.<br /> This is the just a taste of the beginning of the Hunger Games, the first book in an amazing trilogy.  The author propels her reader through the chronicle as they are drawn into this world of fantasy where there is an adventure full of drama, betrayal, and love. Collins does an excellent job, and makes you feel as if you are a part of this world with her extensive details. I could not put this book down. I read the entire trilogy in one week, and had withdrawals when it ended, I wanted more. I searched for other books to fill the void that was left when the Hunger Games trilogy ended.<br /> I would recommend this to older children, maybe in middle school and up. It’s an easy book to read with a lot of action, where a child and an adult can easily relate to the story. Kids are exposed to violence at such a young age with all the video games and even the news now a day, so I guess maybe the higher elementary kids could enjoy this too. The book is definitely better than the movie, as with most books turned movies, a lot of detail is missing, and the story changes a slight bit, with the plot remaining the same. I imagined Peeta much more handsome than he was played in the movie, a definite downer in my opinion. This is a must read! I highly recommend it.
B008RXYOKY|3.0|Using it to hook up avid mbox to macbook air.  It works.  It is pretty weak that Apple makes you spend this much to support it's own technology (firewire) but, when you have the mindless masses convinced they need to buy every new iDevice, you really don't have to care too much.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|I didn't expect to enjoy this game. Then I found that I had gold medals on all but one stage and had all but one achievement. I had discovered one bug, because it had stopped me from taking an alternate approach to one very complex stage (draw the tightropes from the top down).  By the way, my six year old grandson also likes the easy stages.<br /><br />This is a fun game. Yes, the art is excellent, and, yes, it is a great idea, but mostly it is really well constructed.

B0084U0IEG|4.0|I was a young woman entering the work force in the late 60's and I identified strongly with Selena Flome .  I remember the days of  accepting that men would get the prime assignments because they were the heads of family,after all.  It was the beginning of the &#34;sexual revolution&#34;, the beginning of feminism, the  first  anti-government protests.<br />The one weakness in<br />the book is the &#34; letter&#34;  explaining motiaion and tying up loose ends of the &#34;twisted ending&#34;.  I have always thought the letter ( or speech, for that matter) was a weakway to ilustrate the plot  and I hated seing it used here ( twice, actually).  The book was, however, an enjoyable  read.

B00338QENI|4.0|Wow!  This book is FILLED with history and information.  It's an educational read with an emotionally charged backstory.  I found it to be a difficult read, only because I'm not one who gets pulled in by history. In the areas where the story was being told, I was definitely focused.  Yet, those were few...too few, in my opinion.  The book itself is well written, the story is well laid out, and the mission of giving voice to a mistreated family was certainly accomplished.

B002NF1ZI6|5.0|Lego makes fewer and fewer of Bricks & More &#34;free-building&#34; packages (try finding lego wheels anywhere!) . I guess kits are much more profitable. That's too bad. They're a great way of developing your children's creativity and engineering skills. Not to denigrate the kits in any way – you also need skills to put them together; just not the same as when you create a Lego piece from scratch.

B00BC5FN2C|5.0|\\"West Wing\\" gave viewers a taste of a White House populated by government folk who fought the good fight and had its citizenry foremost in their concerns. No such luck here. In this outing, the people of the United States barely exist in the minds of government. They are fodder for those seeking to gain, or seeking to stay in, power.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Kevin Spacey plays congressman Frank Underwood, a very bright, savvy individual who knows his way around Capitol Hill. He knows how to get things done because he knows what's in people's souls and how to play them to his advantage. His wife, Claire (Robin Wright) heads up a a more socially conscious organization in the private sector but is no less addicted to power than her husband. They have a peculiar relationship to say the least. This is almost a diary of the various 'projects' in which they are involved and how they play them, even when unforeseen things happen.<br /><br />This is some ugly, scary stuff. In my heart of hearts I don't want to believe this view of our government, but I fear it is probably a closer take on reality than is \\"The West Wing.\\" The manipulation of people, the press and other politicians will make you puke in your shorts. The relationship between Frank and Claire alone can only make me wonder what world they must have lived in as children that allowed them to grow up in a way that would make them think behavior like this was Okay.<br /><br />David Fincher (one of my favorite directors) helmed the first 2 episodes and well establishes the color and tone for the rest of the series. There is a greenish pallor to it which gives it a sickly feel. All the acting is top shelf and a fleet of veterans are on hand to insure that. The directing is good. The writing is exceptional. This is as good as any series I've seen on TV. My hat is off to Netflix in that they didn't feed it to their audience one episode at a time. They released the entire series in one fell swoop allowing their viewers to watch it when they please.<br /><br />This is a remarkable effort and I hope the ratings are such that Netflix keeps it going.s to watch it when they please.<br /><br />This is a remarkable effort and I hope the ratings are such that Netflix keeps it going.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|When my sister, who is not an animal lover, raved about this book, I knew I would have to read it.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />This is the story of the life of Denny, his wife and daughter as described by Enzo, Denny 's beloved dog. Denny is a natural race car driver who is especially gifted at racing in the rain, a skill that many drivers rarely master.  Denny is not a full time race car driver, and has less time and money to devote to his passion after he marries and has a family.  The main story is how Denny and his family struggle to realize their dreams, while dealing with all the twists and turns life puts in their way.<br /><br />Enzo is a very endearing character.  Even though he is the family dog, he is very philosophical and thoughtful.  From watching television while the family is out, Enzo learns about reincarnation and the belief that after one has been a dog, the next incarnation will put Enzo into a human body.  With that in mind, Enzo sets out to learn as much as possible about being human.<br /><br />Enzo's observations about the lives of the humans in his life, and his thoughts about life in general are very insightful.  I think the author does a wonderful job with this character, and provides an interesting perspective on human behavior.<br /><br />Much of the story is told in the context of racing metaphors, but the reader need not be a racing fan to understand them.  I found myself re-reading passage frequently because the Garth Stein can turn a phrase and tell this story so adroitly that I did not want the story to end.  This is not a story in which everything is sunshine and roses.  The characters endure pain and hardship and I did find myself crying in a few spots.  It is a wonderful story which the reader will be drawn into and become almost emotionally attached to the main characters.<br /><br />I rarely say this, but buy this book.  You will not be disappointed.

B003YHSE7W|4.0|I was overall pleased with my purchase. I really enjoyed the movie. I do feel compared to the first it was only slight inferior, but otherwise it was still enjoyable to watch. I added this to my \\"Pre-Avengers Collection\\" with much anticipation. Even though I liked the movie it wasn't without its flaws. Some things in the story wasn't well resolved and the running gag with Stark and the Senator, while entertaining, was a bit unnecessary in my humble opinion. The movie really picked up when Rhodey donned the armor. I enjoyed him having a more important role in the film.<br /><br />Another gripe I have is I think Jon Favreau made himself involved in the movie more than he should have. I guess when you're the director you can do that. It's not major, but I just really didn't see a purpose of him being in the movie.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good guy. It has some good special features and I just enjoy it. Good buy.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I Like it, Thanks so much, it arrived quickly and soon enough that's Why I'm Completely appreciated with you Guys.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great series leaving a longing to read more. Still lots of answers I need answered so I am going to continue reading the next books.<br /><br />In all a great book set in a post apocalyptic world with great characters and a good story throughout the books.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love the series.  Even my husband is watching with me. All the acting is very good. Maggie Smith has become my favorite actress.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Profound fictional account of a period of time with a man and a tiger at sea in a lifeboat--very profound and beatific. Marvelously written--I recommend this book to all animal lovers and lovers of species humana.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game! Just I have no idea how to update it! I love it on my kindle fire, works great. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. It's fun and interesting and addicting. This is so fun to get home and play. Every time I get further.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|I Like it, Thanks so much, it arrived quickly and soon enough that's Why I'm Completely appreciated with you Guys.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The trilogy is well done with or without the sex. The dynamics between Ana and Christian captivate the reader while the slow revelations prolong the fascination. The situations invite the reader to ponder their own responses and choices as if they were a character.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|As someone with a history of working at a stable and with horses directly, I found this game to be quite amazing and also quite fun.<br />I truly can't say enough good things.<br />I've already &quot;bonded' with my horse - Apollo - a truly magnificent beast.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I'm in love with Downton Abbey series and this completes mine.  So happy to find it.  Received it in record time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really like this show even though scary shows are not really my thing.  Because scary shows are not my thing, this show scares the bejesus out of me.  Mainly because I don't think it's too scientifically off the mark that something like this could happen (a widespread viral epidemic that adversely affects humans, not flesh eating zombies).  The most scary thing is that the walking dead are not the most dangerous beings on the show.  The humans are worse. One epidemic sweeps the planet and human society descends into a Lord of the Flies sort of situation.  I stress out every Sunday evening.
B0076UXKDG|5.0|You get what you pay for when it comes to camera equipment.  This grip performs flawlessly.  No complaints about Nikon!
076790592X|5.0|This book has changed my life forever. I have purchased several  copies for friends and family because I STRONGLY  believe everyone should read it AT LEAST  ONCE.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Came in very nicly, quick. nothing wrong with it. Couldnt be more perfect recommend for everyone to get it from this person.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app is a lot better than the first one.  It has way better features.  For example, there is a cave, a zip line, and more.
B00785P2QC|3.0|If you don't spend real money'it takes too long to move forward in the game. I was a big fan of the previous editions.
B0057PQJDK|5.0|So many call this rock.<br /><br />I just call it good music that you can understand what they<br />are singing.<br /><br />There been so much music that I can't understand the words with<br />the singer having the mike shoved into their mouth.<br /><br />Call me out of time.  So be. I just know I enjoy music that<br />relaxs me and doesn't push my blood presure or the top.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Shortly after I finished this book I recommended it to a friend, telling her this was the first romantic book I'd come across in a long time that pulled me in from the very beginning and had me staying up into the wee hours of the morning reading about Lou and Will, desperate to know how things would work out for both of them.<br /><br />The best trick Jojo Moyes pulled off was that when I came to The End, I was sad, maybe a little weepy, but I wasn't disappointed by the ending.  That's down to the great characters she created.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you have never played this game,  you are missing out! It is a lot of fun. Even if you're not the best when you start, you get better as you play. The graphics are great and It hasn't lagged once since I got it. And best of all- All of this for free! You should definitely get this game, you wont regret it!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I loved this show! I loved all of the behind the scenes information, I can't wait until season four comes out.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|This was very well written and I have enjoyed reading this wonderful piece of writing. The character ed is so well developed and I love that Audrey and Ed end up together!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I had worn out 2 DVD's of this same movie in the past, its nice having it available on my Kindle now to rewatch again and again and not worry about the DVD getting scratched. I love Kiera Knightley!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This show is so wonderfully written and produced. I can't hardly wait to see what happens next.Every actor is outstanding! I recommend this show to everyone who enjoys these type of period pieces.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I hate this game i went on my kindle and the whole game was deleted and so i had to start over I'm never going to get anything thats limited.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Thank you Mojang for making MINECRAFT FOR KINDLE FIRES!!!!!! But my mom wont let me get it because she thinks people will say bad words to me
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I started watching Season three first, so I was glad to get the other seasons and then re watch season three. I am loving this series...
B00881VLCE|4.0|great app to pass time especially if you don't have an area to do a real puzzle. many different puzzles to choose from as well.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It helps to be able to be charging my phone or Kindle while in bed and still reading or surfing and not be stuck to a short cord. It made life much easier having the longer cord.
B007SGM084|5.0|Could not stop reading this trilogy. Always kept me wanting to read more. Can't wait for feature books from E L James to come out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it so much that I have it on my iPod 5<br /><br />I have it on my iPod touch 5
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Love the show, but love the dvd's more no commericals. I sure I seen more content on the dvd's than when watching on tv. It is a fun show very well wrote. It is different than the old Merlins. This is about Merlin as a kid and growing up. It is alot of fun.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was amazing. it captured my attention as soon as I started reading it. It kept me on my toes and I absolutely could NOT put it down. I read it in less than a week, just because of the sheer fact that I couldn't stop reading it. And anyone I recommended it to has done the same. You just want to see how it ends and after you get to the main twist, you will be in awe.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love new games. Great puzzle! Keep Them coming. If this is good for your brain then I don't mind the brain exercise.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This comes in handy at work and at home. Love how it has a large display screen and works so easily
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I love this series. Merlin keeps you wanting to see more. I look forward to the next series to come out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter loves this game. She is 9. She doesn't play alot on video games, but she plays this one as much as I let her.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing I love it so much my horse is beatutiful and champion I love her sooo much awesome game
0345803485|5.0|In order to truly appreciate the 50 Shades saga, one must be willing to look past the sexual content, past the content that glares at--and threatens to offend (and succeeds in 95% of the books' content)--the sensibilities of feminists, the religious and otherwise morally shackled, and open the mind to the undercurrent humanistic themes. Themes that prove to be beautiful in their own right.<br /><br />Seemingly libertine, the audacious genius of James' combination of personal fantasy and heart-felt scenarios is not lost to me. How she manages to achieve this is a testament of her vast, uncompromising imagination.<br /><br />Christian Grey, the champion of the story, is the embodiment of the apt imagination of E.L. James. Her depiction of his character seems so deliberate and so poignant, as she unravels him with convincing conviction.<br /><br />For me, he presents as a black and white persona who is a phenomenon within himself. He is intentionally introduced as `the perfect man' with mind-boggling good looks, obscene wealth, philanthropy, environmental awareness, etc. However, he is cloaked by secrets stemming from the trauma of his childhood, which leads him to indulge in maladaptive (though functional) relations with women and perpetual self-loathing. He manages to successfully separate these worlds until the advent of Ana, who launches his grey areas--all 50 of them.<br /><br />Ana Steele, though capable, presents with her own insecurities but acts as a polish to Grey's character. His worlds collide as he finds himself falling in love with her. As James reveals Grey's secrets and flagrant sexual preferences, she maintains his paralleled perfections, which bolsters the fantasy. He is sexually competent, unwavering in his attention and affection, and relentless in his efforts to keep Ana safe, and sets this as his number one priority. Despite the attributes that make us uncomfortable, Grey's staggering display of passion and emotion allows readers to fall in love with him.<br /><br />The language, if compared to classics, may seem a little hit and miss, but it achieves a vibrant and interactive telling of an amazing love story. James is deliberate in her paradox and controversy, with ideas and conflicts that are strategically included to get you talking--whether you hate the book or not. More importantly, the overarching triumph of the book is the lesson that regardless of our imperfections, insecurities, secrets, past experiences and heinous consequences, we all possess the desire to touch and be touched--unconditionally.<br /><br />Please check out my book [[ASIN:B00BFDJNOU 50 Something Dates with 17 Mr. Wrongs: Lessons From A Dating Repository]]

B000UO338W|3.0|Being a Ministry fan for over 25 years I've been spoiled by Ministry for years of melodic, headbanging, industrial music. Ministry wrote the script on marrying metal and melody. With at least 3-4 songs having hooks like a cat o' 9 tail. This CD did not reach that point and I was hoping with continued playings it would get there, but it never did.I was never drawn into wanting to play this CD over and over again as with passed Ministry albums. I gave it 2 stars but added a 3rd because of reputation and maintaining the classic Ministry sound,
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Although I skimmed some of the data heavy parts, I thought this book described me and several of friends very well.<br />I have recommended to a number of people
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I saw this in the theatre and was very moved by it.  I have always been a horse lover and the story will leave you in tears of sorrow and triumph!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game with easy control and fun to do<br />I got the game of my brother at first I thought it was a total<br />boy game but NO its basically just a modern version of temple<br />run!!! This game is a little bit addictive but I have over come<br />The addiction so make sure you do as well! To top of all of this<br />The game is 100% free! So go on get it its free so if you don't<br />Enjoy this game get rid of it....it would be like it never<br />happened. But I guarantee every one will like subway surfers.
B003G4W49C|1.0|The story line sucks, and the story itself is quite boring, A six year old as a battle commander, makes me think some one has dreams of little boys, that being the homophobic author.

B008FYZIVY|4.0|Great series! Almost done with Season 3. Well scripted, acted and visual (ie.: costumes, location, background). I highly recommend even for families of teens.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I was really liking the app until I got to the mine part and the game got stuck with no way to get out.  Tried hitting the back button but it just disappears so now I'm stuck next to the lift with a missing wheel and absolutely no way out! Can't believe I paid for that!!

B001DU8T6S|5.0|....If for no other reason than THE MOST EXPRESSIVE VOICE IN ROCK is featured.<br /> Granted , it does sound completely different than when Mercury was w/ them. THANK GOD !<br />I can respect the loyal devotees who swear by his \\" unique \\" style & approach , but Mr Rodgers soulful tones soothe the most savage of beasts and apply a masculine swagger that has always been lacking in Queen's music.<br />In addition , Mr May's playing sounds absolutely re-energized.<br />Those who slam Rodgers and this release are COMICAL ...
B001M5UDGS|5.0|There is so many more features on the DVD that I am very pleased.  There are also so easter eggs that are just as awesome.  Well worth the money.
B005LAII0I|5.0|This is a nice change in the whole Snow White theme story idea.  The humor is great and keeps you interested.
0684803356|1.0|Hemingway is my favorite all-time author and I love his writing style but this book drags on for the entirety. The only excitement I can remember was some dialogue from a character named Pablo who made some threats. How this is considered to be a classic I have no idea. I slowly plodded two thirds into this book and simply gave up. But then again \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" considered another classic, was brutal but also boring and basically a pamphlet.<br /><br />I urge everyone to pick up Hemingway's Complete Short Stories. Those are really his best work and I have read all 500 or 600 pages TWICE. That is how brilliant and fascinating the stories are. They never get old, there are endless lessons about sadness, life, loss in those short stories that ANY GENERATION can relate to. He simply masterfully sums up in less words what it would take most writers much longer to express. As a matter of fact, they would not be able to express them in nearly the same way.<br /><br />Hemingway I am convinced is better served as a short story writer than a novelist. I have tried to read 7 or 8 Hemingway novels and have given them a chance but the only one's that impressed me were the books that were actually collections of his short stories.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I've been hooked on solitaire for years. It's great to be able to take it with me on the road. Really helps pass the time. Never had a problem being able to access this game either.
B004MPR80E|5.0|Engrossing from start to finish, coming from a medical background, this is the best book I have read in ages! Part historical, part real-life, this book is a fascinating look into how haematology/oncology began to what it is now. I was so hooked by the first paragraph of the book, a great read for all health care professionals.
0385751060|5.0|I first saw this in the movie format and knew that it was based on a book.  The book was as good if not better than the movie.  Told from the viewpoint of a small boy in a very bad time during WWII.  No real &#34;happy&#34; ending but then that would depend on your point of view.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I have listened to this over and over again.  Helped me understand the show before I saw a live performance.....  thumbs up!
B0000268M6|5.0|This is a beautiful album.  Anyone interested in evocative yet simple piano should look into Einaudi.  I've enjoyed everything I've heard from him.
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|Love Tennant as the Doctor, and this set has some of my favorite of his specials, like The Waters of Mars and The End of Time which served as his final, quite powerful, appearances.  The picture is superb, and if you have a decent surround sound setup of powerful enough speakers your walls will probably shake with some of the effects and the musical score.  Only way they could have made the set better would have been to include his Christmas specials as well, though I don't think they were ever shot in high-def so they may have lost something in the conversion process like many other things seem to if they had tried.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I mean although sad at times and horrifying at others. I enjoyed the read and how well the story flowed. Mostly I enjoyed the many lessons learned along the way and the ending of it all seemingly realistic and necessary.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|After watching this movie, I felt great! It's a true story, a pretty simple story of how people and groups and countries that have strongly opposing views came together in the Arctic to save three whales that got trapped in ice. It's pro-environment in a way that makes you really appreciate the power and beauty of nature, no matter what your political views are. Drew Barrymore is great as a Greenpeace person who champions the whales; John Krasinski is extremely likable in everything he does and here, too; Ted Danson plays the oil company executive who gets into the act and nails it..everybody is good.<br />The setting is a small Alaska village .... really makes you wonder if that kind of wilderness will still be here in a few years...It's beautiful.<br />The incident happened in and takes place during Reagan's presidency, and, gosh, how time moves on.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|it is a rather average puzzle game, but as the map is rather extensive, it can get confusing to find your goal. nothing extraordinary
B0083F5JE6|5.0|I was glad I was able to find a clean edition of this album.  My kids wanted it but I could not locate one in the stores.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game of fantasy and fiction! The game has many different elements that keep you interested.  If you like to follow stories that you are a part of this game is for you!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is super fun and very easy to play. I highly reccomend it. Especially if you are an animal lover. So many different animals it is amazing.
B0081336FO|4.0|We really enjoyed Sherlock season 1. The characters and stories are engaging. While we liked season 2, we could have done with less of the suspense/horror aspects of some of the episodes. The episodes seemed a bit stranger as compared to season 1 or the original short stories.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Totally not what I expected. This movie was freaking hilarious I loved it. It will keep you entertained and laughing all the way to the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's just like temple run but with better graphics and more addicting. Can easily play for hours on end. Great game and I can't believe it's free!
034580404X|4.0|There are 3 books in the trilogy. They come in a box, hence the term &#34;box set &#34; Each book had many pages, composed of many sentences, composed of words that contain multiple letters.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|Grace Kelly and Cary Grant are to elegant and well acted.  The film takes place in the Rivera, Monte Carlo.  What a scene.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|The beginning and ending of the book were okay, but the middle was long, and not that interesting to me.  It was written about England and I didn't know that much about the area or the agency she worked for. Too much unnecessary information.
B00402FGE4|5.0|exactly as advertised and a good price, and quick service. why do they require so many words on these ratings?
B00009W0U4|4.0|I would have to watch it again to get the full story line. It was rather hard to follow the first time around.
1932735410|5.0|This book helps understand all nuances of project management by providing great tips .. And also helps get PMP certification faster!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is by far the best and one of the only open world app games and the best mobile spiderman game by far
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is got to be the best Grace Kelly film ever.  Her dresses, her acting and vulnerability, she is so courages in this film.  The pace a good in this firm with suspense.
6304836619|5.0|Sometimes it is on TCM movies, which, after I saw it, wanted to purchase it. Took forever, because the later remake, w/Caine in Olivier's role is Boo, as nearly always, w/remakes:  not as good. Can't beat this combo of actors, if you can ever find the 1972 version--took me more than a year.

B000KJT8IG|5.0|Has to be the one of the best Christmas movies ever made and thats saying alot. We watch this at least once but more the likely 2 or 3 times every Christmas season. I still laugh my butt off everytime. Chevy Chases best.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really cute game and quite fun, I was looking for a game for my kid but I ended up playing this instead. I wish it was easier to get gems, though.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I honestly didn't think they could do a good Medieval Fantasy on TV but i was wrong. A bit drawn out as they set up players but soon settles doen to a good pace and great story. Love the charaters. they could have picked better people all around to play them.
0786108401|5.0|Had to settle for this company's part 3, as I originally bought Parts 1 and 2, but not available when I wanted Part 3--can't recall the recording company:  maybe Blackstone. Anyway, the audio book is great and part 3 fits in well enough w/my original set. Can't even find who made this one on Amazon's description:  big secret, I guess.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is for the fans of temple run! THIS IS THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD! If I had to pick between temple run and subway surfers it would be subway surfers! no question about it!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This is a really good case. It's lightweight and small enough that it doesn't add to the sleek form of the Kindle Fire. The case cover flips back to act as a stand for the Fire, which I use all the time. It's a really good feature. The elastic band it very handy as well. I use it to secure the cover closed and also to keep the cover open. Very handy! The price is well worth it, and the white color looks very sharp. I recommend this case for anyone looking for a case of any sort, a good competitor for &#34;Oth(t)er&#34; Box and also for the Amazon brand case.
