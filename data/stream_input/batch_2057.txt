B006LSZECO|2.0|I can't say much more thank what's been said by others here: the first 70% of the book was a great read - the ending was a big weird nothing.  I felt like I wasted my time reading it.
B000ICZD5M|1.0|Other than the total inaccuracies in the entire thing, and how nothing was explained, leaving anyone who hasn't read the book clueless.  (Hell I studied the book and I'm still quite confused as to how things happened)  They did not spend NEARLY enough time showing Fremen culture, or the struggles Paul and Jessica went through post-attack.  I did not feel connected to anyone in any way, so when a character reappeared, or was in danger, I was like \\"nah man i don't even care\\".<br />Overall this movie was complete garbage.  If you have read the book and are debating watching this movie I wouldn't, you'll be sorely disappointed.  If you haven't read the book, go read the book and never watch this movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very good!!this novel grasp your attention from the first word! Awsome! Hope to read other work from this author!! LOVED IT
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|If you love Christina Aguilera, you will love this CD!  I especially love the duet with Blake Shelton &#34;Just a Fool&#34;.  I love just about every song on this album so I am not going to critique each song, but this is a must have for your collection.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What is there not to love? It's the best series ever since Downton Abbey. I can't wait for season four.
B003IPC5SO|3.0|It is ridiculous to have a minimum word requirement. bla h bla h blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
0062011847|4.0|but amusing none the less.  This is currently still making the rounds of my family, all of whome LOVE Terry Pratchett.
0811821846|5.0|It is ridiculous to have a minimum word requirement. bla h bla h blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was perfect in every way. It was a realistic love story of trauma, hope, relationships, and love. Exceptional ending that is satisfying.
B003LXM1RS|5.0|It is ridiculous to have a minimum word requirement. bla h bla h blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B00AREIAI8|4.0|You should get this app . Don't listen to the other bad review's.  If you like animals this is the game for you.
B006ZS4G24|3.0|for legos it had very few pieces and it was way overpriced  i only purchased it because my granddaughter really wanted it for xmas otherwise this was a big ripoff
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Vintage Clancy. You feel like your in the cockpit with the marines, in the streets of Hong Kong with the CIA guy. Fantasy sure, but a fun read.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This tag team has hit the spot with their global perspective on twenty-first century cyber warfare. They picked out the adversary and almost with psychic ability laid out the strategic plan for our downfall, almost frightening, but then it's fiction, right. A very well thought out narrative with a bold look to our future. Five stars again.
1250006341|5.0|Plenty of pictures  and background of characters.  Haven't really begun to read it but glad I have the book to use as a refernce while I watch Downton Abbey.
B009X01ELC|5.0|I made a good choice when I picked this one. I really like the rotating feature as it makes for easy access to the charging port and the stand up feature is very secure when in position.
1465001123|5.0|My granddaughter, a big Taylor Swift fan,  loves ths calendar and has it hanging in her room.  It's a great gift!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great new version of a very fun game. love the mineshaft level too. go get it already! excellent game and you cant beat free
B00280LYIC|5.0|It wants you to keep reading no matter what and the story is interesting might keep you entertained for days even weeks
B008YRVW0I|5.0|The board changes so it's different each game. The fish tank is fun, but I could take it or leave it.
0316212261|5.0|These books are wonderfully written, and very entertaining.  The mix of steam punk, supernatural, and romance makes this series well worth reading. Not to mention addictive. I had to order the set because my library only had the first two, and the suspense was killing me. This is definitely one of my favorite series.
B005OGYH90|5.0|C'mon now. How could this be anything other than eargasm producing? It's great, they are great, they chose great songs to play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The 0.6.0 update is coming out tomorrow , the update is going to be awesome!! Mojang ur the best thanks
B009IEXKXI|5.0|While I've never been on Mars nor did I ever travel on a NASA spaceship I found this book scientifically very believable. Everything the guy manages to do and fix while stranded on the red planet makes a lot of sense, at least to me.<br /><br />What I didn't expect from this book is all the fun I had from the sarcastic style of his log entries. So much so that I would recommend reading this book only because of that :)
B007HACDLK|5.0|Typical Vince Flynn..... paints a good picture that the reader can relate too.  Keeps the reader engaged all the way.
0807014273|5.0|bought this book for a theology class but had to cancel it d/t new breast ca diagnosis. plan to use it in the future though
B0034G4OYA|1.0|I had such high hopes for this movie, but it was a huge letdown. It was paced far too fast, skipping right over prime opportunities for laughs. The few attempts at jokes were crass and overdone. With zombies being set afire, body parts falling off, and scenes with a way-too-scary Dracula, this film is also not appropriate for young children. This one is going into the garbage - might as well have just thrown the money in the trash.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|vast improvement over an already great game. totally redesigned from the ground up. big scary monkey chasing you down .
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I corrected whole way through. It was perfect. A good read and a very good choice if looking for a new book!
B003EEBCR4|5.0|The single greatest recording and performance of one of the greatest operas ever written. The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and Vienna State Opera deliver a grand and epic performance of one of Wagner's best works under the direction of Rudolf Kempe.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the third time I've read this book, and it never gets old. One of the best books I have ever read.
B005VT42BS|5.0|Find every device on your home, wired or wireless network. This app is Fing Awesome (pun intended).  I don't know what I did before I found it.  It will show you MAC address and IP addresses.
B001IF252M|2.0|This adapter is made for Apple computers, but is not made by apple. It still works, but be aware the plastics are not as refined and put together like apple products
B00511PTWM|1.0|Product breaks at the tip where you plug it into your car, fuse comes out, plastic separates where the socket screws together.  Bought 2 of them and glued one together and that still does not help.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|It does say it is made for ipads, but why not make them work on iphone and ipods as well? my iphone has more storage that my ipad and it would make it easier to transfer to it while on the go than my clucky ipad.
B003L20IJM|5.0|I loved the story, and of course, the characters are wonderful. Love Emma Thompson as an actress an writer i
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I don't cook a lot but i still get to use every one of these at least once a week. They're very resistent to heat. I just wish i'd bought the package that came with the stand.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very touching! She made the the reader feel right there on this heart wrenching journey! It was a great story filled with love, pain,forgiveness,and hope. Well done!!!
B008I34ZUM|5.0|zappa and the mothers shine on this live recording.george duke on keyboards gives the performance a jazzy and soulful feel.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Boought it because I've read a couple of his earlier books. This book is ok but I get tired of his sarcasim, asides that stray from the topic of the book.(The Panther)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Funny and good It's like your in a hrose game. You can have funny raiseing a hrose of your onwe.
B000002UJQ|5.0|A great album and still my #1 album since I purchased it back in 1997. The album seems to transform as the songs continue to play. The theme of the overall album is a transformation from the human perspective to a technological/computer based theme. The songwriting and concept is pure genius! The album takes a turn that becomes more gradual after track #5 \\"Let Down\\" and \\"Karma Police.\\" Both songs have electronic/synthesizer harmonies and give foreshadowing of changing musical themes throughout the album. This album never gets old. The end song The Tourist has a haunting chorus with Thom Yorke yelling \\"Slow down, Slow down.\\" This is Radiohead at their finest. Kid A and Amnesiac took a different approach to music and then came back with Hail To The Thief. OK Computer is the most interesting and artistically written album I've ever heard.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I found &#34;Two Graves&#34; to be a really boring book. Had to force myself to finish it. Would not recommend it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This books is one of those books that made me happy and had me enthralled in it from beginning to end.. it delves into the subject that we all shy away from which is mental instability and it does such a wonderful job of making sense of it to people that don't have these issues.  Pat is a beautiful soul and character inside and out and he is yes going through some tough times right now but with the way that he has his outlook on life and his silver linings.. you can't help but pull for him.. fantastic book and a great time to read.  :D
B002RAREAK|5.0|Thats what I am talking about R & B  music that will put you in the mood for a special night with the one you love and bring back beautiful and sometimes sad memories  but its all good  Thank you
0618154043|4.0|The book was in good condition, it had very minor wear on some parts along with a few marker scratches here and there. But otherwise came in very good condition with no other issues.
6304696515|5.0|It has alot of action shows about a person struggles and the survial of one that had lost everything love friendships betrayal  and how to stand up to your enemies this is really a great movie thank you
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Have always enjoyed the Terminator films, and found this series to be totally captivating.  The writing, acting and directing are world-class.  Whoever picked out the actors for this one hit the nail on the head.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Thats what I am talking about lots of awesome music i love it i really like R & B music that gets you into the mood for a very special night with the one you love and adore makes you think about the good times that you had Thanks
B005KTZ05G|5.0|I bought this as one of my Christmas gifts to my son. The detail work is great, and he really likes it. If you can tell us what size of stand to get for him, that would be great!
6304711905|5.0|It has alot of action shows about a person struggles and the survial of one that had lost everything love friendships betrayal and how to stand up to your enemies this is really a great movie thank you
B0031RAOVY|5.0|True story, to find a family pet that is so loyal to their owner, forgetting his own needs.  Have never heard anything about this breed of dog before.
B0006L0LNY|5.0|It has alot of action shows about a person struggles and the survial of one that had lost everything love friendships and how to stand up to your enemies this is really a great  movie thank you
B005IEGUDY|3.0|This is the second time for me reading this novel and it is more pleasurable  in Kindle because I don't have to hold the huge tome in my hands.<br /><br />This book is a panoramic quilt of English history from the beginnings to 1980.  At times it might be a bit tedious but not to a casual student of English social history.  I found I wanted to read further in the actual historical record. I think that the only thing that is underdone is the significance of nearby Stonehenge in the very early days. The many henges were more than religious sites and they long predated the Druids.  I think valid cases have been made for them as primitive but accurate  astrological computers has been overlooked.<br /><br />  The monumental (pun intended) efforts lent to the huge cathedrals in Norman and later times emphasizes how the wealth and labour created by the lower classes spent on these religious piles of stone emphasizes the lack of balance in the society of the day.  Oh well, these were the days when people believed and the rights were determined by the biggest sword or lance.  All in all a good read if you are interested in England and you have the patience for the possible tedium a big book.
B009PEKRY6|5.0|my daughter has been rocking out to this music since Christmas, I don't know what else to say to meet the word requirement
B001AQMBNC|4.0|I would almost describe this movie as a sci fi chick flick. Its a touching tale of what happened when an alien civilization answered the invitation we sent out with our Voyager probe. All you sci fi buffs know how that would go down, but don't let the inevitability of the end keep you from enjoying this uplifting and bittersweet story.
B0092YO8C6|5.0|my daughter loved this for Christmas. I don't have anything else to say that will meet the word requirements sorry
B008Q0AOF2|5.0|A true classic. This film is absolutely invaluable. It has love, action, mystery, suspense, adventure, and war all tied together in one. For the heart and moral, it is mostly inspiring and uplifting.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It takes forever to get energy and if you don't have enough of one thing you don't progress in the game at all.  In the end you just get stuck.
B004OZZ624|5.0|WOW this movie had my heart pounding so hard I thought I was going to have a heart attack...and it makes u feel like u don't want to blink because u feel like u just might miss a great moment. Great movie!!!!!!
B008PNBU30|5.0|I purchased this for one of my buddies and he loved it. The packaging was nice, cd was new and quality is great

B004CEUEWE|4.0|Good movie that we really liked. Great actingvwith a good story and pilot. Check it out fir yousekf today or
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Very happy with this product. No flaws in the lens as some people have reported. Plug and play. no issues with tracking.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is a fun, addicting, and exhilarating game. It is way better than the first one. The mine cart and the rope addition are pure genius.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|This concert is absolutly amazing. JT is so talented and the show is worth it. I honestly recommend this DVD if your a JT fan
B0076DELIG|5.0|A lot of twists and turns keeps you wanting to keep reading to find out how it ends.  Hard to put down once you start.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is the number one game to play.... it is so much fun to play and the horses are cute and life like.....
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Makes you believe that love really can win despite evil obstacles. It's a nice love story with some surprising elements to the story.
B003MC5AV2|5.0|I luv thus book. It is hilarious, sad, romantic, and a bunch of other stuff. I wish there was a second one. I WANT MORE!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is amazing. The assemble cast, the photography, the writing and the costumes are to die for. I'm a junkie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it's the best sequel to an app so far. It has very high quality graphics and there is much more to see and explore than the first one; It keeps me very interested and entertained.
B001BZE82E|5.0|My mother in law loved this watch.  She is wearing it every day.  Beautiful in person as well as in the pic.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. The only bad thing is that there are never any new characters in this series. My brother owns the whole series but I really wanted to read this one night so I bought it and couldn't stop reading this book I ended up finding the book that night.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|When I was young I watched and LOVED IT. Now I bought it so my teenager enjoys what I used to enjoy.  We all love this movie and had watched the collection many times over.  Thank you Amazon.com for having it.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book is Life changing. I absolutely love it I definitely recommend it to all. Looking forward to reading all of her books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn has a magician's talent.  In Gone Girl she accomplishes quite a trick: she writes a story in a way that totally suckers you into believing one thing...when in fact the truth turns out to be many other things.  By now the movie and book industry has desensitized us to plot elements of \\"twists and turns\\" and \\"who done it?\\" to the point that we are primed to expect it.  In this book the author manages to erase our immunity for surprise and delights us with a story that makes you feel all shinny and innocently new to these tricks of the trade.<br /><br />Gone Girl tells a story that readers can relate to and get invested into (as you read, before long, you'll be thinking \\"oh poor darling\\") and, like a car crash, keeps you from \\"looking away\\".  After a while it sucker punches you in a way that makes you glad you were so naive and unsuspecting.  The middle of the book just squeezes your intellectual guts as you feel bad for the character; but for whom do you feel bad?  You're just not quite sure and that is the best part.<br /><br />I'd tag this book as:<br />+Yes, just do, it pick it up already<br />+You'll be mad and glad about it<br />+But wait there's more (the author has another 2 deliciously disturbing books to quench your thirst for this style of writing)
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I really enjoyed it - a difficult subject handled compassionately I have recomended it to several of my friends It is memorable
B005LAIIHG|2.0|The cinematography was striking at times. The story almost had the qualities of a bedtime story. A polytheist stuck on a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger. I was expecting more of a Swiss Family Robinson meets Robinson Caruso type of thing. I just was not too impressed.India meets Steven Spielberg.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|This is very cleverly written  and researched - it is so funny and ridiculous it certainly keeps you interested and remembering the past years
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Free at last or so it seems. Yet our stunning couple continues to face up hill battles that will ultimately bring them closer together or forever tear them apart.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|A typical John Grisham the plot kept twisting, and you were never sure if things would not end badly, had trouble putting it down
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Its dark, its sexy, its naughty, and it has a great story line! If you want sex this book has sex if you want to know and understand the darker side of human nature be ready to hang on to your seat because you are going to get that to. A dark and twisted story with so many lessons to learn.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game!! My 6 y/o granddaughter enjoys it and so do I.  Very addictive!! Makes you think! Some are easy and some are difficult. Great app!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|E L James has created a rolling series of interesting books. Again a dark and twisted story line emerges, but so does more depth to the characters. Are there more to our main characters than sex?
B004SBX112|4.0|This thing is addictive and glad to be rid of the ads. So much fun, so many games and just a great way to kill a little time or relieve some stress.
B000TGJ80I|5.0|i love this movie because of kate beckinsale because she is god, and that is a fact you can take that to the bank. throw her in leather and you have the perfect vision of beauty.<br /><br />danny mcbride made an awesome mix of violence, dialog, and backstory for this film as well as it's sequel
B0098VYKSA|5.0|The movie seemed to move along well.  Good character development.  Well filmed.  Enjoyed the British Isles travelogue (filming locations). A bit dark for children though.
B000641D2Y|5.0|great movie even when the sequel is the exact same story as its predecessor but still brings enough change that you forget for 90 minutes and still love it and would watch both hands down
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|If you are hooked on Lee Child's Jack Reacher books, you should read them in order, as best you can. The Killing Floor was great, page turner, and it was hyped up to be.  I'm Only four books in, and have a lot of nice reads to go.  Write Lee write!!!  Keep the good stuff coming.<br /><br />Rod
B003ZSJ212|5.0|love these films iv v vi &#62; i ii iii<br /><br />the blurays have a beautiful quality about them the only thing i wish is that they were the original trilogy and not the altered ones that lucas made that take away from the classics<br /><br />especially in return of the jedi! why alter the monster on tatooine? it was perfect as is? and why add the whole new song and dance number to jaba's palace? hmph<br /><br />still i love these films and do not regret the purchase
B0084U0IEG|1.0|This is a really slow read. Time and time again I read long descriptions of something that had nothing to do with the story....if in fact it is a story.  Save your money.
B000GYI32M|4.0|bought for my little sister and she loved the show and re-watching it without commercials on a syndicated channel that scrapes for viewers
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I ordered this to read on my iPad. Quick delivery. Wonderful page-turner. Exciting and informative. Then saw the movie. Amazing!
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|love this movie, if you've never watched it you should<br /><br />it is a classic in it's own right and tom hanks plays the part perfectly, the dvd is a great buy and quality
B008F5YDRI|4.0|This movie was an absolutely refreshing surprise. From the clunky title, I was expected to be bored out of mind, but rest assured that this movie is anything but boring. At times romantic, at times funny - other times poignant - it's well worth renting or buying.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|purchased this on the deal of the week for $50<br /><br />it was possibly the greatest deal i have ever done on the internet, all three films in three forms and well worth it, i love all of the films and the box set is beautiful
B006LSZECO|5.0|Stop whatever you are doing and go buy, check out, or download this book right now. Everything you've heard about this book is true - absolutely phenomenal. Gillian Flynn doesn't save twists for the end (although the ending is The Twist To End All Twists), there are twists and turns all throughout this novel. Sharp, witty, funny, sad, mind-bending - I really couldn't put it down.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|every twist and turn of this film has you on the edge of your seat and every character is played perfectly<br /><br />it's one of those films that keeps you locked in to the story
B00428CPUY|5.0|This was a gift for my boss, and he loved it. I can't compare this to the other crossroads festivals because I have only watched this one, but it was great to watch.
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|bought for my little sister and she loved the show and re-watching it without commercials on a syndicated channel that scrapes for viewers
B003N0XDT4|5.0|My only complaints, are that sometimes the volume buttons don't react that quickly, and that I haven't noticed a large enough improvement to use this always strapped onto my ipod. I almost want the model down that has a simple knob for volume adjustment. This has wonderful battery life. The DAC works great, and I have begun only using the amplifier for that function with my computer, because with my low impedance headphones, I don't really benefit that much from using an amp rather than the built-in ipod one.
B002ZG981E|5.0|bought this on sale under $12 for one of the best films of the year! and on bluray<br /><br />the picture and sound qualities will not disappoint!
B003JLA4KS|5.0|This wasn't designed to just let a rush fan know a lot more about the band, this was also made to entertain anyone who hasn't heard of the band, or who has heard a few songs and is curious about that genre of music. I don't really see much benefit in the more expensive Blu-Ray, because so many video and audio clips are from a long time ago and aren't of the best quality anyway.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is very addictive and fun.<br />My daughter got me started and now I play more than she does.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The whole time I was waiting for a twist or a turn, but really this book is just the first person account of a boy who is a little socially awkward.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really nice game my son love horses so this game is really good for him. He really enjoys the game and plays its really easy to do for his age.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have read many books by David Baldacci and this is one of his best. The story is fast paced and the characters are engaging and believable. The story line kept me guessing until the last page of the story. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to other readers.
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|My son wanted this game to play. He really like any game that has to do with racing or cars. but he dosen't paly it that much. I don't think it holds his attention.
B0063GORYU|5.0|lots of fun and easy<br />  to learn. I played it on my Pc so was glad to find it on my kindle.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I put this on my son's Kindle. He enjoys playing it. I would not recommend it to just anyone thought. if your child just bangs on it like a regular piano it can get on your nerves.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This is a must-see, if not a must-have, for any &#34;Phantom&#34; fan out there. The absolute best performance of &#34;Phantom&#34; I've seen. In my opinion, the 2004 film (feat. Gerard Butler & Emmy Rossum) delivers the story and drama more effectively, but this 25th anniversary performance is far superior in music and in every other aspect.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is also a good game for kids. It promotes awareness of surrounding and how to connect several things together with cause and effect.
6304711883|5.0|I have wanted this movie for my library for years!! Now I have it and know that I will watch it many times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son loves to play this game. I think it builds hand eye coordination. I would not recommend it to younger kids.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|Love the music, love that kid's inspiring attitudes and respect that they show their elders and wanted to have both releases.  I Watch this video many, many times.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My son likes the movies so when he saw this game he said he just had to have it. It is a good game to play. He enjoys building his &#34;village&#34;.

B004PGNB1K|5.0|Can't wait for the final book to be released! This is beautifully written! Can't put the book down!!! !!! !!!
B005HSL626|5.0|My son loves to play this game. We have a similar game on the Wii and he can play it for hours.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|This is the first book featuring the gritty Norwegian policeman Harry Hole but it has only recently been translated into English. It is of potential interest to see where Harry came from but this book does not help a great deal on that score. The book is set entirely in Australia, mostly Sydney. For an Australian like myself, some aspects of the novel are slightly irritating in that Jo Nesbo makes a number of explanatory comments about Australian culture, demography and other aspects of Australian life. I could have done without these observations and they are not the sort of comments that one would read in a novel about most other countries and are not necessary.<br />Otherwise, the story is the sort of thing one comes to expect with Harry Hole - complex plot, unpredictable murderer, grisly scenes with Harry slipping up a few times. A good read
B000000WHC|5.0|great cd for my dad for a christmas present! as a cd collector my dad wanted this cd...hard to find now a days!
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|An unbelievable story about a man with a double life he has no idea about. A little slow at times but the content is great.
B009FZFONO|4.0|If you love zombie movies then you will love this show. If you love serial tv action dramas you will love this show. It's very gory and sometimes morally vexing. If you can't take a show that deals with human atrocity then I don't recommend it.
B005HSL626|5.0|you shoud get this app because you slide your finger across the screen and slise fruit and you get more blades
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|This is fun, has some bugs but hopefully they will fix them.  Other than that I haven't gotten bored. Love the pirate characters.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|I am a fan of Resident Evil till the beginning. I do have all the film + animes and games on consoles.
B000PXUA5W|2.0|Nice product. Very difficult to assemble. Instructions could use improving a great deal. Very difficult for children to assemble. Would not recommend this if there is no adult to assemble for you.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|I bought it because i really love this film. A nice film to watch in family and or with friends.
B000KFB4PK|2.0|Nice product. Very difficult to assemble. Instructions could use improving a great deal. Very difficult for children to assemble. Would not recommend this if there is no adult to assemble for you.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|I've started to see the film but stop it because I didn't really understand what was really the film talking about.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|This app never downloaded for me.  I wonder why?  Everything else I've purchased just zooms right to my kindle but this one never showed up.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|enjoy the game but it has restarted 3 times.First restart was at level 30 with 100000..crossbreading a Pegasus..was really bummed..will see how far I get this time..not thinking I'll play again if I loose it again..
B00B5N1Q3Q|5.0|This film has been underestimated at every corner! The reviews are pathetic, so I'm going to give it the review it deserves! First of all, you need to read [[ASIN:054792822X The Hobbit]]. Go buy it and read every page. Now everyone expected this to be hardcore dramatic action like [[ASIN:B000X9FLKM The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring / The Two Towers / The Return of the King Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray]]]....it's not because that's how it works. The Hobbit is a simple story, that's how Tolkien wrote it.  was the big epic he made after the simple story, of the Hobbit. But after waiting 9 years I can understand that expectations were very high, but no one took the time to calm down and go see it as a simple adventure.<br /><br /> Now the movie itself follows the [[ASIN:B000X9FLKM The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring / The Two Towers / The Return of the King Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray]]] very well. The story is simple and follows along, like the book. There are a few bits in the film that are off from the book, but they mostly work well with the overall theme. The underlying theme is of course trusting Bilbo and knowing just how useful he really is. I overall love Andy's return as Gollum, though I think it was taken a little too comedic. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is great performance as it was in Lord of the Rings. Martin Freeman as Bilbo was a really good choice, he nailed it! I am looking forward to The Desolation of Smaug and to see the mighty dragon himself! The film is overall faithful to the book and a really good film.<br /><br /> Now for the criticisms...It's too long? It's following Lord of the Rings! The theatrical cuts were 3 hours long and the extended cuts were 4 hours long....what did you expect??? Confusion....I heard this with [[ASIN:B0085Z8F4A Prometheus (Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy)]](an absolutely amazing film), if you're going to see a movie... PAY ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS!!!!!! Also, don't be so closed minded, try to enjoy the film, not criticize!<br /><br /> In closing this movie is really good, and Intend to but it and it's Extended Cut. I hope you enjoy as much as I have. Don't forget The Desolation of Smaug hits theaters December 13th!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app was totally worth 7 dollars! MC-Pocket Edition is one of the BEST apps I have ever played on my kindle! I recommend this app. I love Minecraft and ever since my computer broke I have been waiting for this to come out on kindle fire.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Streep and Jones are terrific. They play their parts well. It's a funny movie that also provides good insight into relationships. Carell does a good job in his role at the therapist. I'm an experienced psychologist and thought his portrayal offered me some useable insights for the work I do as well. You will not regret spending an evening with this movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|this is by far the worst book I have read  in a long time.  two  thumbs  down… the plot had potential, but the characters were contrived.  The writing lacked depth, don't waste your time.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|This was an enjoyable movie for a night when we were not into anything great, just entertaining. Everything works out too well to be believed. There is no ambiguity, no unresolved pain. It's a light comedy and good if you are in the mood for a light comedy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love that i can pause it, play it from any computer any where. When i log back in its where i left it so i can resume
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|the bird is not exactly angry but a bit bother some so if you want turn down the sound for this one
0385535147|4.0|I liked the book but not my favorite of one he has written.  I got pulled in and couldn't stop reading but not my favorite ending.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|i have this one on my kindle and the screen is a little small but i enjoy it  wish i had it on a large screen
0525425764|5.0|Great book, even for adults.  A fast read and such a delightful boy.  I would recommend for any young adult.
B001W6S0C6|5.0|Michael Keaton was a good batman when this came out . this was again, bought for a friend's b day she is a huge batman fan<br /><br />highly recommended
0545265355|5.0|I gave this to my granddaughter for her birthday.  She was very happy to receive it.  It arrived in perfect condition and on time.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|again, bought for a friend on her b day , i managed to score this limited edition packaging for her, she loves anything batman, i figured the joker cover was a nice touch :)<br /><br />highly recommended
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This movie is endearing and funny plus the songs are catchy.  I love to watch it during the Christmas season.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Very good, keeps your intrestest and has a happy ending! Acting was great, and it was a feel good movie.
B004M20YDU|5.0|I love this re hash of the music from Tron. I am not a Daft Punk fan, but I really liked this album.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book wasn't what I expected. It kept me in suspense every time I turned to page. Wish it could have been a movie, so I could see these characters come to life. It was a truly wonderful read.
031620157X|2.0|The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell had all the elements of a great Middle Grade adventure, but sadly it fell a little short for me.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of the story was the setting. It was fun to explore The Land of Stories and meet all the fairy-tale characters. I really liked that all the side characters had their own unique personalities, especially the most famous ones. I mean, we have Goldilocks the fugitive with a smart mouth and then the self-centered Little Red Riding. The main characters, though, were pretty one-dimensional. It felt like Alex was always embarrassed of her brother and Conner was always grumpy. I wanted a little ore from them.<br /><br />The pacing didn't work for me either. Often there were no transitions and we'd go from looking at the forest up ahead to suddenly being in the forest on the next sentence. It was too abrupt and made it feel a little bit like stop-motion. It really pulled me out of the story and didn't let me get pulled in for very long.<br /><br />I didn't find any of the \\"big reveals\\" surprising, either. In fact, I figured many of them out WAY ahead of time and found myself rolling my eyes whenever Conner and Alex would be confounded by this or that. I did, however, really like the Evil Queen's backstory.<br /><br />The Nutshell: The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell had a lot of really good elements, but it just didn't work for me. The journey and setting is fun, but the twists, main characters, and pacing really bogged down the story. I'm hoping for some more growth with Conner and Alex in the sequel and maybe a little more of their mom, as well.<br /><br />Near Miss
B008FPZQQU|4.0|I love this band and am looking forward to the release of the rest. However, I'm having a problem with the 3rd disc, the 5.1 DVD Audio/SACD tracks. My Pioneer DVD AUDIO player will not play the thing. I have gotten 2 copies of the set from Amazon and they both are turning the player off when I put the disc in. The 2 CD's play just fine. The owner's manual for the player states that if this occurs, the disc was illegally copied. But it's not a copy...Has anyone else seen this? I'm keeping my second copy, but I hope this problem does not occur with any others...???
071815780X|5.0|Recommended by a relative.  I'll get lots of use out of it.  Nice pictures, thick paper used in the book.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I think I have a new favorite artist... This album did not contain even one bad song, every single minute of this CD is fantastic.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Very good CD. I look forward to listening to it over and over. Thank you very much for your prompt attention
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book deserves only the best rating, Rick Riordan uses the historical background of both Greek and Roman mythology along with superb imaginative skills to create a wonderful book that keeps readers on the edge of their seat while still giving them historical references, in all the whole Heroes of Olympus book series is both a captivating and knowledgeable experience, and I personally cannot wait to read book four and other books from Rick Riordan.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This arrived immediately and I was thrilled to have it. The book itself is a little disappointing but is managing to keep my attention.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My opinion is that if the creators of Temple Run didn't come out with a new game , everyone would loose interest in the game .The reason I say this is the new game Subway Surfers stole everyone's interest. But I highly recommend this game!
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I have been unable to view this DVD though it arrived quickly and in good condition. I look forward to watching it when I get the time.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really looked this book. It's true that you can ese Harry Potter in it, but as \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" developer you ese less and less similarities. For example, Harry knew his enemy was Voldemort as soon as he round our why he was famous. Percy Jackson didn't know his enemy was Kronos until later in the book. In Percy Jackson you never see a triple agent. And what better than to have a series similar to Harry Potter for those Harry Potter fans looking for something to read since the Harry Potter series is finished? An excelente book, I give it five stars.
B008Q09K2U|5.0|Fantastic book, great storyline, as usual.  I just couldn't put it down. I just love John Corey & his funny lines mixed into a really great book. Looking forward to the next one.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Very good movie.  Great cast and locations.  Made me think of what I am going to do when I get old...
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|Why do I have to write so many words? Why do I have to write so many words? Why do I have to write so many words?
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|Got it on time, it's amazing & I love everything about the CD, band, how quickly it came, & just everything!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My five year old daughter loves this game. She says she loves the new stuff. The background, jewels to collect, and the cool rope to slide on
B005IQZB14|4.0|I chose this book because it was this month`s local book club choice.<br /><br />This book was a very easy read and found it hard to put the book down at times because I wanted to know what happened before I went to bed.  There are many trials and tribulations the author goes through on her life's journey and she carries us with her every step of the way.<br /><br />It is obvious that the author was troubled at the beginning of this book which was only exacerbated by her mother's death. She realized that she definitely needed to turn her life around and hiking was the choice she made to do it. In her haste to get started with her journey she made some bad choices regarding shoes and backpacking equipment, but it wouldn't be the same story if she was perfect.<br /><br />No need to critize her, we are all human and make mistakes. It shows the human side of Cheryl and makes you appreciate it even more.<br /><br />By the end of the book I wanted to take my own hiking trip...
B0050KEVO6|4.0|I like this app. I had one on my iPhone and enjoyed it. It's fun trying to create new elements, and I enjoy seeing whatever picture coincides with the created elements
B004V5QWU2|1.0|I uninstalled it almost right away, as the loops of sound are so short, I can't even imagine using it for a minute,let alone all night. Don't waste your money like I did.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's a solitaire game. Not much else to say. It's just like every solitaire game out there. Love having it on my kindle.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Great set :) It had everything that I wanted in the package, and more. Gave it to my boyfriend as a gift. He loved it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a good read, written by a man who should know. As a brain surgeon who experienced a life threatening illness it gives us all hope for heaven.
B00992CF6W|3.0|i really liked this game when i first got it... i was obsessed actually... well i liked it so much i bought the computer version. When i started playing tge computer version i realized it was wayyyy better than the mobile version ... for many reasons... like theres no lava. theres no nether. theres no other creatures except creepers. archors. zombies. spider... and there are no caves to explore... there are wayyyy less things to craft... theres no villages or villagers...its too easy...<br />but its a game to play when ur bored i just suggest the nonmobile version because its way more fun! (:
B00009APK1|5.0|One of the best movies of all time....Good vs evil, magic, love and action...action and more action...you just can't miss it
B003TML0VO|3.0|every song on this CD is a classic and Santana performs them extememly well.  The only thing i did not care for was that by the end of the disc the music tends to all blend together.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I am constantly moving this mount into various positions and it works worderfully with my 13 lb smart display.  The height adjustment is a little stiff but if you don't plan to be changing the height constantly as I am, it proves to be very reliable. Update - if you lift the weight of the display as you adjust, height adjust works very well.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|This album caught me off-guard. I like Gorillaz, but thought it was only okay after my first listen-through.<br /><br />Then I sat down and gave it a second go.<br /><br />It has a great variety of artists and styles occurring, and the themes in both lyrics and sounds really give you a nautical feel, and you can capture some personal meaning in its messages on pollution and our cultures' effects on it.<br /><br />It's brilliant.
0141345659|5.0|I absolutely adored this book! After reading it in the course of two nights, I loaned it to a friend, and to his sister as well. Everyone I've met has really loved it. It's so sad, what happens with Gus, and I felt myself tearing up. Four for you, John Green. You go John Green!
B002ECN4P0|5.0|It was nice to find one CD containing so many great songs by the Rolling Stones.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves music.
0446547646|5.0|I have every one of Nicholas Sparks's books and I love them. This book was in perfect condition. Way to go!
1878424319|5.0|This is a must-read for any sentient being who wishes to coexist peacefully in the world.  Practical & practicable advice here.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly is a classic as is. the Harry Bosh series. I hope that others will try some of his previous works.
B008OB1QFK|5.0|This is to me his second BEST album.  Highly recommened for any Chris Knight fan!  This is a must have for any Red Dirt Texas fan.
B002ZDOXM6|2.0|Another confusing \\"Playlist\\" tracklisting.  I thought the purpose of these collections were to expose a more well-rounded body of work, not just focusing on the \\"hits\\".  98% of this is a greatest hits album.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|One of my favorite movies. A bit of a mind bender that keeps you thinking and wondering up until the end.
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|Easy to setup and use. I'm able to stream music(except FLAC), and most movies. My son, in Korea, has installed this app on his android tablet. It seems to work well for him.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|This is a re-mastered full 1080p version. I was worried that it wouldn't work on blu-ray players in the U.S. Since it's an import from the U.K. But, luckily it's for A, B and C regions. So it worked fine. This re-mastered version won't be available in the U.S. till mid february 2013. The studio did a superb job on the re-mastering. Looks better than some newer movies on blu-ray. Get detail and color retention as well as clarity. It looked awesome on my new Sony LED/LCD t.v. and Sony blu-ray player!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|better than the 1st one. very addictive. i love the added zip line. i have heard nothing but great things and i agree.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Absolutely the most well written book I have ever read.  The magic system is genius but not used as a deus ex machine. Every word of every chapter serves a purpose.  Amazing series!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Not much more that needs to be said.  Great character development by the writers.  If they get annoying, they become walker food.
B004BSFC6Y|3.0|These are even cuter in person than they look online. My daughter loved them and played with them a lot. It's a lot more fun than just sucking on your own toes, right? But they were very small. I wish we had bought them sooner. My daughter was 6 months old when we got them, and I think they would have been better at about 3 months.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Ok, so I got the app yesterday and it won't open anymore!!!!!!  When I could play it it was fun and awesome, there was a mine part, swinging on vines, and all kinds of hills an turns.  Would give it five stars if it opened, but doesn't!!!!
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Elf is a great movie for everyone.  I'm not a fan of A Christmas Story, but Elf I try to make sure that I watch each year.  Highly recommend it.  It's appropriate for various ages and not as dumb as some of Will Ferrell's other movies.
B002VPE1WK|2.0|This will certainly hold all your junk, but unless your on a photo expedition you won't be dragging all your equipment around with you.  This is a $99.00 case that was included with the camera, but it's very uncomfortable to wear.  The adjustable shoulder straps aren't long enough.  Kind of like a kids backpack.  It rides high on my back and the cross strap cuts right across my neck.  Would have been better to reduce the price of the camera another $100.00.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  There's plenty of action and a great plot.  It nicely wraps up the entire series.  As much as I absolutely loved The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises gives it a run for it's money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|GREAT horse game. This is that one type of game that is very rare, but very awesome too. This game is soooooooooo ideal for horse lovers and I'd totally recommend this to anyone who likes these types of games. TWO THUMBS UP!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this app for falling asleep and staying asleep.  I also like that I was able to download additional sounds for this app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can build what ever you want have as many worlds as you want and all of your friends can join and have as much fun as you
B0084U0IEG|1.0|Once I reached the half way point in this book and nothing had happened, I had to stop reading.  I couldn't invest anymore time in a bad read.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved it!  Very intriguing with a suprise ending. The author had a great imagination and wrote it well in the book.
B0059XTU1S|4.0|I went to see this movie over the New Years Eve week. I didn't want to wait in line for the 3d version, so I went to a regular viewing. The very beginning of the movie I felt like I was watching an out of focus movie. Someone told me later it was just my eyes adjusting to the way it was shot by the filmmakers, but it really bugged me.  I hope the DVD when it comes corrects this because I don't own a blue ray or 3D dvd player.<br />As for the movie, LOR is one of my all time favorite triology movies. I've read all the books, plowed through The Silimarillion and The Children of Hurin and everything else written by Tolkein including the awful Christmas book.  But the Hobbit is a fave of mine and I like what they did with the story when they made the movie.  Is it exact? No, but it is true to the nature of the book, the thread that runs through all the books and it's a little nice I must admit, to be surprised by the changes in the storyline. Nothing like imagination!!!<br /><br />I am very excited for movies 2 & 3, and PLEASE Mr. Jackson, I'd love to see my name in the credits again along with the rest of those who are the Fan Club members.  It was nice surprise to see us all listed in the credits at the end of the first 3 LOR movies!!!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Not a lot of substance, but good visual style, and probably true to the source material.  It knows what it is, and it does what it is very competently.  Better than most of the crap films out there, and also better than the original Stallone cheese fest.

B00A6L78YE|5.0|Learned of these guys from Unknown Mortal Orchestra.  Glad I did.<br /><br />All Stones comparisons aside...  the bass line of Under My Thumb is hummed in On Blue Mountain.<br /><br />Ain't a bad song here.  They're tuneful and dirty.  My first love of 2013.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I never thought it would end. It wad amazing and thrilling sad and happy...for me unexpected and brilliant to a reader.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|I enjoyed this book, although I wished it had a bit more in depth explanation of how Mr. Foer actually trained his memory. Some of the elements were extremely interesting (Memory Palaces) although at certain times there seemed to be side stories that didn't have much bearing on the book as a whole.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It started working fine on my kindle fire but now it won't start up.  Thinking I may have to remove &amp; start over :(  Good thing I was only on level 6...still stinks!
B00867GHS8|5.0|A Disney most own bluray!! Fine picktures and good Sound! The 3D was very excellent with depth and deep colours.
B005LAIHCM|1.0|It's a shame that such talented actors allowed themselves to be cast in such a poorly written and prdictable movie.<br /><br />Really, do we need to see yet amnother portrayl of a the incompetent small town cop?<br />Do we need Elizabeth Shue, an actress whom I have always liked , playing a woman who doesn't seem to have one likable quality? I could accept that if she were playing avilian, but I think she was supposed ot be a sympathetic charater. The charater is very one dimensional.<br /><br />Are the two main teenage charactersreally supposed to be in love? Because they had no chemistry. As good as they were individually, they could seem to find a real connection in the contrived situations their characters were in.<br /><br />Were we meant to figure out the big plot twist within the fiorst 40 minute sof the movies? I watched unti,tne end beacuse I thought there must be something more than the twist I had already figure dout. It was too obvious. the characters pretty mnuch tell you the ending of the movie long before it happens, you just need ot listen.<br /><br />This was a terrible waste of time.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|4.0|I hate to break up the 5 star party going on here, but here goes: Chances are if you are reading this review you are already familiar with Helloween, a band with a near 30 yr history which I have been following since day one and the four song vinyl \\"pumpkin cover\\" EP for those of you old enough to remember that one. Ever since learning their lesson with the near career-ending \\"Chameleon\\" Helloween have been putting out fairly solid and consistent metal releases for the last 15 yrs, some better than others , but none of them could be labeled \\"bad\\", you may even say they are the most \\"reliable\\" metal act out there. \\"Straight out of Hell\\" is another good release but not a great one, I think \\"Gambling with the Devil\\" was their best release in the last decade, \\"7 Sinners\\" was good but had a way overproduced sound to it and overly cheesy lyrics, \\"Straight out of Hell\\" is like a medium of the two albums, it has some of the \\"catchiness\\" of Gambling yet also suffers from some of the \\"overproduction\\" of Sinners. Weikath and Grosskopf , the founding members prove to still have the best songwriting chops, Deris as usual can craft both some of the best and worst tracks on every album, and Gerstner's compostions prove to be a little amateurish. The album starts strong, fades in the middle with three weak tracks (6,7,8),the title track kicks things up gain (9), then It's kind of mediocre auotopilot for the rest of the album (10-14).<br />The lyrical content still suffers a little too much \\"cheese\\", vagueness and redundancy.<br />Deris's vocals are a love/hate affair, they are starting to show their age and you can hear they are very \\"studioed up\\" yet he has been a loyal and consistent bandmember for over twice as long as Kiske was, I just wish he a had a little more talent and range, his ballad singing on here is cringe-inducing.<br />Bottom line, it's another solid release from Helloween,just not quite worthy of all the 5 star reviews it's been getting. Weikath needs to pen moresongs on the next album.<br /><br />addendum: I just listened to the track \\"No Eternity\\" , only available as a bonus track on the Japanese edition, and I must say I am completely perplexed as to why this wasn't included as a main track on the standard edition, it would have been one of the best tracks on the album, signature Helloween sound.
B009XTF8KQ|1.0|Nothing to see here, folks, keep moving. Since the 70's, movie makers have copied and ripped off The Exorcist, hoping to make something as frightening and thought provoking as that instant horror classic.<br /><br />Ths movie is yet another attempt at that.<br /><br />I do give the makers of this film credit for veering away from the overdone Catholic exorcism and taking it into Judism. Unfortunately, when you fail to come up with original scenes and dialogue, it doesn't matter whether it's a priest or a rabbi, it is the same predictable story we've seen many times before.<br /><br />Add to this, the most annoying, self absorbed characters anyone could create (seriously, I couldn't even feel sorry for the possessed kid) and then throw in some cheap effects to cover the fact that there is no real action, and you get a pretty dull movie.
0156347113|4.0|The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money is a landmark work in the history of economics. The theory it puts forward is essential for dealing with recessions but remains deeply flawed on other points, most notably in accepting the so-called &#34;business cycle&#34;. It is not a normal economic phenomenon due to fluctuating returns on capital, as Keynes supposed, but a psychological one: a sequence of &#34;this time is different&#34; asset bubbles and crashes, and other human causes of financial panics. However, Keynes demonstrated that the conventional economic thinking of the time was far more deeply flawed. It still is today. We are all still wrestling with the issues Keynes raised, even though some economists have gone far beyond what Keynes was able to put together, because so many have not even reached his level, and have in fact regressed from the level of his predecessors, those he called Classical Economists.<br /><br />Economics today can fairly be compared with astronomy between Copernicus and Galileo, where Copernicus had a small part of a much larger truth (planets orbiting the sun) but not enough to convince the astronomers and astrologers of his day. Galileo contributed telescopic observations of sunspots, mountains on the moon, and particularly the moons of Jupiter. Kepler then contributed elliptical orbits, and Newton contributed calculus and an adequate theory of gravity to explain elliptical orbits. At this point, Ptolemaic astronomy went away, but not, of course, astrology. The principal resistance to this work came from the Catholic Church.<br /><br />In our time, the principle obstacle to real economics can fairly be called the Church of Mammon. Trillions of dollars in financial shenanigans ride on not enough of us understanding what is going on, and the public not having the political will to put a stop to it. In this analogy, Keynes is comparable with Copernicus, and we have had our Galileo and Kepler, but not our Newton. Milton Friedman and the Chicago School Market Fundamentalists are the Ptolemaics, and Arthur Laffer is Ronald Reagan's real chief astrologer, as one of the leading lights of Voodoo Economics.iedman and the Chicago School Market Fundamentalists are the Ptolemaics, and Arthur Laffer is Ronald Reagan's real chief astrologer, as one of the leading lights of Voodoo Economics.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Repeat of same storyline with different actors, not quite boring, but not sure I can recommend in good faith. Mediocre at best.
B008220D7S|4.0|Saw this shortly after it came out<br />There are lots if old jokes and plenty of new<br />The situations are real if not exaggerated for comedic purpose<br />Overall it was funny but as with many comedies once you've seen the ad on TV you may have seen the best of it<br />I would have liked the hotel scene to have been more developed rather than the few seconds they gave us<br /><br />Like my title though I heard my wife's real laugh, the one you can't hold in or change<br />Maybe that says more than anything<br /><br />Snitches end up in ditches :-)
B008476HBM|3.0|I enjoyed the story. Very interesting as how women where suppose to behave. I'm glad we've as women have evolved.
B00865P3AS|3.0|Wow. 2 Cellos opened my eyes and ears to a new genre or music. Love it.<br />BUT: as much as I liked the first, that is how much I did not like the second.<br />Maybe I need to give it another listen while in a calmer mood, but their version of \\"Clocks\\", it pains to say that Lang Lang, destroyed it for me. There was even another song that grated on my nerves so much, again maybe I need to hear it while in a different place mentally, but I had to skip past it. \\"Super Massive Black Hole\\" is one of favorites by Muse, and I was disappointed, maybe I needed no voices, just cellos.<br />Thanks for reading my rant.  ;-)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The characters were relatable & likeable. I really enjoyed this book. Couldn't put it down! Well written by Ms. Hoover.
044024238X|5.0|I have read so many of this author's books and I think they're all hysterical and poignant, well written and charming! I love Undomestic Goddess and have actually ordered it for a friend of mine. I like getting other people hooked on Sophie Kinsella's books!! Read this one! It will take a prominent place in your bookcase!!
0062086529|4.0|Love the creative aspect of this story.  Kind of wish there were more colors but really cute story.  Both my boys love it.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I love my Kindle fire HD!  but I did not find it has user friendly as my old first generation Kindle fire.  By installing ES File Explorer I was able to access more items that made my HD be mine!
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|I am the biggest Bocelli fan having all his CDs including the new Opera box set (fantastic if you are an Opera fan).  I was very excited for his new release and have always loved albums like Romanza and his pop renditions in Spanish and Italian.  His voice is flawless and beautiful as always and I particularly love when he sings in Italian and in duets.  I am a little disappointed in the selection of this album, and it is a little too \\"easy listening\\" feel to it.  It is still good collection due to his beautiful voice and I could never rate him low, but I think some of song selections are a bit weak and a little too easy listening/elevator music pop sounding for my taste.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great graphics and engaging story line. worked flawlessly on my kindle. hours of gaming with a good mix of HO and adventure.<br /><br />.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great read! Couldn't put it down. The tension and fast pace in the book makes it addicting!!!  Both books are a must read. Can't wait for the 3rd!
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I like this calender because you can change about of the color and themes.  Sign up for ajorte account and you can sync it so you don't lose anything.  Very easy to figure out
B004GE81CK|5.0|I have this original and am shocked it is not completely worn out, sure it has a few scratches but this is really music, you can hear the words and the instruments, pop at it's best..lay back and just relax. You will feel it..
B009X01C64|5.0|This does everything it was supposed to do plus some and is very quality workmanship. The Kindle fits Securely in this leather case And protects the Kindle extremely well
B004QL7K8E|5.0|Genius! Original and out of the blue.. &#34;To the break of dawn ya'll!!&#34; Probably the best party movie ever made..
B0087JTAKW|4.0|It might not be up there with his classics (Morrie), but it sure does make you think about the way you're spending your life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game for anyone to have. for a little girl and learning about horses. people. have a tendency to get lost in what they are doing. must have game.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Love all of Lee Childs (except Jack Reacher Rules). LIke everything he writes but especially Jack Reacher series, Books by Lee childs keep you guessing
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like the fact that the game is programmed to make logical destinations for the cards I tap, when multiple destinations are available, a second tap will automatically move it to the next available spot.  Still tough to win though!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Much better than the first game, but sometimes the game crashes when you choose the &quot;save me&quot; option after you die. This has happened to me several times. Pretty annoying if you have millions of points racked up and you've broken the highscore and suddenly the game crashes because you choose to resurrect after dying.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|It was good but not the best. The ending was good as well with a nice cliff hanger. Still would have liked more action I guess
B001CL4N68|5.0|If you're new to Nas, this is the place to start.  It is his finest work...an absolute masterpiece.  Get it!
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I love this game. I play games like this on the compuer but this is just much better. When i first got this i was skeptical but now i cant go for 2 days without playing it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The episode itself was fab, however, viewing of this through Amazon Instant Video was quiet annoying. We tried to view this late at night, and the signal was horrible, and it would drop the signal and have to reload literally every 30 seconds. We stopped and tried again the next day, without changing anything, and it worked fine... odd, but quiet the inconvenience for something billed as \\"instant\\"
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great tool for exploring the world, yourself, and your interest in travel, hobbies, health and beauty and even art! I am a beginner and it was fairly simple and self explanatory. All you need is to know yourself and want to be creative!
B000002UTO|5.0|this album disapeared fast and gets really no mention when duran duran turn up..but i bought i the day it came out back in 1988 on cassatte tape and now i get to play the cd. all the songs are interesting and point duran in a direction that saddly didnt last...i even went to the big thing! tour back in 89'.....all in all a great collection of songs if you love duran duran!!! now if only i could find that wall size poster i had of duran from the big thing tour??????
B000FA57US|3.0|It was a gift for a friend. They enjoyed the movie. It is not my type of movie. I could recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is much better than temple run. It has better graphics and gameplay. It is soooooo fun. You should definently buy it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|you are always surprised by the twists and turns and never know what the next chapter will hold.  worth reading
B009B1EOZ6|5.0|An excellent edition for a great AC/DC's concert in Argentina, 100% recommended!!! For those about to rock AC/DC will always salute you!!!
B00008RH1H|5.0|The transfer was perfect--I can't remember when I saw this film without streaks and clicks.<br />A must purchase for the Kurosawa fan
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I have not read a book for quite awhile that has invoked enough emotion to bring a tear to my eye.  There were many times in the book that I physically felt Victoria's emotions.  A wonderful read.  I will never look at flowers the same way.
1250027624|5.0|The book is just beautiful - I just wish it could have gotten more into the characters as they leave us after Season 3.  But I am enjoying the book - helps take me back into the Downton world.  Book came in perfect condition and I appreciate the fact that it had a plastic wrapper to keep it pristine.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this edition in about a week. The books flow fantastically and the story is riveting. I am an avid sci-fi reader. I probably read somewhere around 50 books a year and this is the best find in at least the last five for me. Looking forward to the next two in the series that I just purchased.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This is a really fun Christmas movie and has become a go to favorite already. Our little girl loves it and we have found ourselves laughing at it and enjoying the family friendly story too. Actually bought it after we finished watching it.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|I read several reviews before buying this DVD. They were too mixed for me to stay away. I like Portman and Kutchner anyway but enjoyed the script regardless of my prejudice. It's not rocket surgery and never went up for an Oscar. It's just plain fun to watch Portman trying to avoid getting envolved romantically with Kutchner. Don't over-think the show, just watch the movie and enjoy.
1576754227|5.0|Hands-down, this is the finest productivity book I have read.<br /><br />The unusual title refers to the saying from Mark Twain, that if you have two frogs to eat in the morning, you should eat the biggest, ugliest one first.  Then, eating the second frog won't be a big deal.  Tracy applies this to productivity.  If you start your day working on the biggest, toughest task and finish it completely, the rest of your day will be enjoyable.  The average person procrastinates on the important tasks, and wastes time and energy working on less-important tasks.<br /><br />There are 21 chapters, each identifying a technique that will help you become more productive.  The chapters are bite-sized - many are just four pages.  The \\"frog\\" principle isn't one of the 21 techniques, but is a theme incorporated in several of the techniques.<br /><br />I especially liked Chapter 3: \\"Apply the 80/20 Rule to Everything.\\"  When it comes to your to-do list, this rule means 80% of the tasks on your list are low-value items that will not benefit your organization or make a difference in your career.  Only 15% to 20% are the valuable tasks you should start and complete first.  As for the 80% low-value tasks on your list, Tracy says you should delegate them or return to them only when your valuable tasks are done.  Unfortunately, most people make themselves less effective by spending their time on the bottom 80% of tasks, the ones with no valuable impact.<br /><br />You have seen many of the techniques before, if you have read other time management books.  But Tracy presents the material in a fresh way.  Also, his writing style is simple and direct, which makes the book appealing.<br /><br />If you want to become more valuable to your organization, this book will give you practical techniques you can start using right away.
B008KE3960|5.0|this is a great game and I recommend it. fun, entertaining, and great graphics, also very addictive...try it you' 'll love it
B004LWZWC4|5.0|My husband has watched this movie a bunch of times... he really loves it.  (I do too btw)  It's a cute movie with a good message and gorgeous scenery. I got it for him for Christmas.  He was very happy when he unwrapped it.  Even though it has a cast known for comedy - and there are some light-hearted moments - it is not over-the-top.  It's not played for laughs, but for the message it gives.  Well worth watching.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I would have given this game 5 stars, but I haven't been able to really enjoy it.  Many of the options require you to use \\"gems\\" to be able to fully enjoy the game.  A few are given at the beginning, but any more must be purchased for rediculous prices.<br /><br />I would have paid a few  bucks up front for more options, rather than $5 bucks every few days to buy gems.<br /><br />So, no 5 star from me...
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I visited Paris in 2010 and fell in love.  So, when I saw this movie, it was like watching my visit all over again.  The same love affair with the city (and country) - right down to the favorite era of the main character! (I, too, love the 20's and 30's)  It was as if Woody Allen consulted me on the story line, then changed the main character to male.  I love this movie... and I love Paris. The opening scenes that show some of the most famous places brought back so many happy memories and I could sit there and say &#34;I've been there!&#34;  It totally changes your perspective.  If you ever get the chance to go to Paris - GO!  It is truly magical.  And if you can't, then watch this movie instead.  It's not quite the same as being there, but it's darn close.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|If you thought this book was about a penny pinching old codger, you were only half right. A revolutionary book that brought about massive social change.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app works great on my phone, kindle, and my tablet! pinterest is never far away.  love it! wish all apps were this good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Oh my gosh this game is awesome! However you can't go to the nether and you can't spawn stuff with eggs but you are able to get inventory editor, which lets you edit the world terrain, change spawnpoint, and give yourself craploads of BUTTER!!! ( gold ) Definitely a thumbs up
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I already have a &#34;good&#34; collection of tools and bits - when it came time to replace a trackpad on a mac book pro, I ran into the need for a triwing bit. Decided to get this kit instead of a stand-alone triwing screwdriver. Quality is great, everything seems pretty solid and I don't get the impression that things will start breaking after 2-3 uses.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wonderful story about the afterlife . Also very interesting explanations of the way the body works and functions in response to illness from a doctor's perspective.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Dark topic, but really funny at the same time. I loved this book. Thought it was amazingly inventive and kept me guessing til the end.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run 2 is awesome and the backgrounds are different from the backgrounds in the first one<br />It is awesome and the first one is not that awesome
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is great!! Really makes you use your mind!! It's not the usual find the items game, it makes the player use objects to find and gain access! I was hooked!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Even though I thought I wouldn't like this book because it was about slam poetry I gave it a chance bc I like the author. I'm so glad I did! Great book can't wait to read the next one!
B004X2M3N8|4.0|All of the episodes are action filled and keep your attention. It is a great storyline tor those interested in sci-fi. I really recommend it!
B007MG360G|5.0|The game was pretty fun, but I found it easier than the other games in the series. It is definitely worth a buy for $0.49.
1451648537|4.0|i liked the book. I have always been interested in Steve Jobs and Apple and even when he took a break from Apple and was head of Pixar
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love to watch Ellen's show everyday that I can.  This book was not a great as I though it would be.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This album is great! Full of energy, real emotion and truly fantastic music. Highly recommended! I cannot wait for more from this group.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|This app would be fine for kids to doodle on.  I would like it better if I could put a finer point on the pencils.
B00992CF6W|5.0|WOW THOUGHT MIND CRAFT WAS FOR GEEKS BUT NOW I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!  great for kindle fire and for i pad mini and u cat play live with others on the same wifi box love game  BEST GAME EVER
B00A7L00XE|5.0|Get Up by Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite is one of the best blues albums to come out in a long time. Ben and Charlie have an amazing chemistry that shines on this album.<br /><br />Ben Harper is one of those amazing rock solid musicians. He has a quiet confidence standing up for what is right and good. At times his voice can be an angry man, and others soft smoothness. His guitar playing is up there with the best. I particularly like when he plays slide. Charlie Musselwhite is not an artist I am familiar with. If this album is any indication, he is an incredible harmonica player.<br /><br />Get Up is right there with the best of the best Harper has ever published. I like that the recording isn't over produced, it has a certain rawness almost live feel to them. One of the songs is such a spartan recording, it sounds like Harper is standing in the room playing his guitar.<br /><br />This album is a perfect version of electric blues with just a hint of rock. There are a couple of tracks with a slight gospel sound to them, in a good way. I actually dislike gospel, in this case it works extremely well. The album is dedicated to Solomon Burke and John Lee Hooker. The album sound is right in line with Hooker's later work. Oddly, this album made me want to sing along on a few tracks. The hooks are just the right amount of infectious to make it easy to sing.<br /><br />The songs are arranged so that this isn't a battle of instruments, harmonica versus guitar. I was afraid this would happen on the album. Instead there is just the right balance of the two instruments. Not every track is pure blues. Ben Harper wrote or co-wrote all the songs. Over time I've come to really like his lyrics. There is a blend of rejected lover, pain with something gone wrong in the world, and hope that we will all do better.<br /><br />The album is card stock paper, no extra plastic case. There is a beautifully printed lyrics booklet with photographs of Ben and Charlie. Here is a situation where the vinyl album would be worth every penny - all the better to see those photographs.<br /><br />Don't Look Twice - A little delta blues flavor, RL Burnside, Honeyboy Edwards, style opening. The song builds to include more instruments and bring in a bit more rock. Great twist on more traditional blues style.<br /><br />I'm In I'm Out And I'm Gone - Modern blues song, a hint of Mannish Boy, Sweet Home Chicago. This is the song with a little talk back and forth between the guitar, harmonica, and voice. Turned up loud, this song sounds like Ben is sitting in my living room. This is the kind of song that tests the best sound system and headphones.<br /><br />We Can't End This Way - The gospel choir shows up on this track. There is some happy hand clapping and foot stomping. This song just pushes my limits of gospel music, without going past.<br /><br />I Don't Believe A Word You Say - This song is louder than We Can't End This Way and is a surprise when it starts. This song is a lot like Ben's previous work with Relentless 7. In fact this is one of my favorite cuts on the disc. The guitar playing is incredible. Musselwhite's harmonica is just perfect fill. There's a bit of Led Zeppelin going on here. I'll admit to shouting along with this song. They refrain is infectious.<br /><br />You Found Another Lover - Ben and Charlie sit down to an acoustic moment. Of course they both sound incredible. Harper's voice on this song is perfection. The lyrics are outstanding - You found another lover and I lost another friend. There is so much sadness in his voice.<br /><br />I Ride At Dawn - Harper honors the military in this song. It's in his blood, like my father, his father and his father before him. Harper understands why somebody would fight in a war, the honor, the pride, and the choices. This song is dedicated to SO2 (Navy Seal) Nicholas P. Spehar. It is a haunting song that marches to the end.<br /><br />Blood Side Out - Get up and move, this is a hard driving blues song.Another favorite on the disc.<br /><br />Get Up - This is an unusual song for Harper - the bass line is so pronounced flowing through the entire song. Everything is hung off that bass line. Harper tells a great story and Musselwhite tosses in the right amount of harmonica. The guitar solo in center and end of the song is worth the price of admission. This is one of his protest songs on the album. There is exactly that right amount of anger in his voice. At six minutes long, it could be twice as long. That guitar playing is heaven.<br /><br />She Got Kick - Whatever this song is about, I love it. The woman has got kick, and when she's done with you she'll move on down the road. There's a bit of 50's swing blues going on.<br /><br />All That Matter Now - Move on down someplace near New Orleans. A nice slow blues piece. The perfect way to close out this excellent album.<br /><br />This is one of Ben Harper's best albums. I was worried that the same disease that hit Gary Clark Jr. might affect Harper. But oh no, Ben has produced enough albums to know who he is and what he wants to play. He is comfortable being an outstanding blues guitarist and singer. No need to try to make this for radio play. This is what I love about Ben Harper; he stands for something and doesn't sell out his music. He has figured out how to blend his deep felt religious beliefs and good music. He doesn't hit anybody over the head with that belief. He simply weaves it into some pretty darn good music.<br /><br />What a darn good album. Thank you Ben and Charlie, you are a match made in heaven.Another favorite on the disc.<br /><br />Get Up - This is an unusual song for Harper - the bass line is so pronounced flowing through the entire song.

B00AA7O6QC|3.0|The first one didn't try so hard.  Cameos should be funny but just seem ridiculous. Please don't make a third one.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|can't. ride your horse I really wish you could but you cant. but I still want the 3 free gems!
B009RH973I|5.0|The case was exactly as described and fit my kindle perfectly! I would definitely recommend this product to others! Great buy!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is where all of my time goes!! Nothing is more fun. Just Do it do it do it. that's all I have to say.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I enjoy the game, but I am not an action figure player.  The game does not hold my attention for very long.  I do like the chase and anticipating what's going to happen next. I will continue to play, in addition to the original Temple Run.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Now, I need to find Season 2 on the Kindle and I'll be happy!!<br /><br />Thanks Kindle - You're the best!
B008JEJPSC|5.0|Came in ontime and it even came with a digital copy!! Win win!! This movie is a great heartfelt movie perfect for any age. I'm glad it finally made it to bluray
0743201140|4.0|I enjoyed the book a lot. I decided I want to try to manage my associates based on their strengths.The reason I am giving the book 4 stars instead of 5 is because the author likes to change a lot of his examples with his/her.  It is not very consistent and can become annoying while reading.
B003YOZNBU|5.0|I know the internet trolls will probably jump all over me if they see this review but here goes. NO i did not read the comic or the book if their is one and i don't care if there is either a comic or book. This movie was actually entertaining and had a good stand alone story. Josh Brolin was great as was the ensemble of characters. If you like westerns with a little bit of super natural i would recommend renting it. I saw this on Netflix and loved it so when i saw it on sale i scooped it up.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I'll keep my review brief since much has been said about it already. This is my first John Green book and I it makes me want to read more of his work. The story is poignant and witty. I thoroughly enjoyed it, I was on a 17 hour flight and I was able to finish the whole thing in one flight. One thing that I thought was a little funny was how worldly the young characters are, which I like but it does seem a little unrealistic. However, it's still one of my favorite books now.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|One of the most provocative  books I have ever read.  Really makes one think outside the box.  I gave it 5 stars because I couldn't give it 6; it's that good!
B009GED3HS|5.0|Love How I Met Your Mother probably more now than when I first started watching it. It finally feels like we're close to finding out HOW Ted meets his wife. I know the show will be coming to an end soon, but I love following these characters lives, and better yet the plots are always hilarious and there are memorable quotes abounding!
B00280LYIM|5.0|My 10 year old enjoyed this book and read it in less than 2 weeks!  He loves the entire series.
B00136S0NE|5.0|Not much else to say.  Raw energy and beauty rolled into one. Glen and Marketa really knocked this out of the park.
B0028IDXDS|1.0|$13 for a pacifier attached to a toy that I cannot remove and replace? ARE THEY NUTS?!! Anyone who would buy this has sucker written all over them! I used binky clips for all four of my kids and never had a problem with them. It made it easy to find it at night too. If your newborn baby is waking up every couple of hours searching for a nipple, they're probably hungry. Feed them instead of shoving a paci in their mouth! All of my newborns ate every couple of hours...they have tiny stomachs. I simply fail to see how this is not a suffocation hazard! They always says to keep blankets & stuffed animals away from babies faces!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Super fun, can get enough!!! My family and friends love this game it has lots of interesting passages and cool stuff!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|AWESOME!! Can't wait for Feb 10th!! By far the most exciting season!! Lots of zombies, and action. Big cliff hanger at the end of the first part of season 3. Must buy for any WD fan
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Wonderdul movie, full of suspense and action! It exceded my expectations. I bought it for my husband's birthday. He loved it!
B00007GZR0|5.0|Typical happy Doris Day movie, lots of fun, lovely clothing.  light entertainment, for any Doris Day or 60's movie fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A  page turner couldn't put it down.  Excellent writing will definitely be reading them all.  I will have to get the movie now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well developed characters and story line  pull you in right from the beginning.  Not many books are likely  to be enjoyed  by a  60+ grandmother (me) and her 10 year old grandson and 11 year old granddaughter  plus all the ages in between, but this one did just that.  Can't  wait to  read book two!
B008HK3XYK|5.0|its super cute and works great to protect my kindle fire HD on the go.  as far as another review i read about not being able to plug it in to charge while in the case...just turn it around
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was as good as the first one but really leaves you hanging.  Cannot wait to read book 3
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is very cleverly written and has lots of surprises. I enjoyed how the author slowly builds the psychological aspects in the husband and wife's narrative.  A great and exciting read!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like FB to keep up with friends and relatives.  It's pretty good on the kindle, but can't upload pictures on the Kindle Fire
B0060MYM7O|5.0|As a big fan of George R. R. Martin's books in the Song of Fire and Ice series, I was thrilled when HBO decided to turn his books into a series. It is way beyond my greatest expectations--the whole series is brilliant--great acting, fabulous scenery,<br />exciting plot, amazing special effects.  Can't wait for season 3.  I wanted to own all the discs, so I can watch them again.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I absolutely love this show and bought this as a gift for someone else. I also like the metal case it comes in.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 I think it is really entertaining I think every one should get this app but that is what I think
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I watched Season 1 & 2 when it was on Showtime. I got hooked and so did my boyfriend, whom I bought this for. Can't wait for Season 2 to come out.
1616550414|5.0|Even for a casual fan of the Zelda franchise, such as myself, this book offers great insight into the makings of arguably the greatest saga in gaming history. As far as content is concerned, if you love concept art, then buy the book immediately. It is packed with great visuals from all incarnations of the franchise. Personally, I was looking for more of the history of Hyrule, and by and large, the book delivers on that front as well. The chronology is well laid out and in depth when it needs to be. Fair warning however...if you are looking to play a Zelda game, I would recommend skipping its section in the chronology. Most of the games' major plot twists are revealed in the chronology. With regard to the book's physical characteristics, it more than earns its $34.99 price point. As with most Darkhorse books, it is printed on quality paper and bound in a beautiful hardcover. With Amazon offering the book at $20.99, the deal is that much sweeter.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is a great game. Help keeps the mind sharp at figuring out  the moves, always thinking, Can be very challengening,
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|A great adventure based on Jack London's own experience in the Klondike Gold Rush, seen through the eyes of Buck, a friendly dog that gets kidnapped.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is great, keeps me busy and is relaxing. I mostly play late at night just before I go to bed helps to unwind.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Like Merlin (the TV series) I am sorry this is over.  I know the actors must be DONE with the same old characters, but as their audience, we could watch forever.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these 101 games are cool.but some I don't understand how to play. but, other ways its.really fun and awesome.I think its really worth it since it is FREE!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|What can I say?  It is a true classic.  At the age of 72, this is my third reading.  I enjoyed it as much this time as I did the other two.
B001F6TXME|5.0|This remote release works perfect. No flaws at all. Does not require you to set your camera in a special mode. Just plug it in and press the button. It also has a lock so you can set your camera to bulb mode and take long exposures. Great product.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|this app allows your kindle to take fantastic pictures with immediate up-load to your social media - extremely handy when you are traveling
1455502758|4.0|Our 17 year old Grandson is a very avid reader, we try to buy books that will keep him interested in reading. This book  surely did the trick.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I wish this show was still on. bring it back! I used to have so much in common with these kind of people.
0756666937|4.0|Great for young LEGO builders, they will spend many hours reading, looking and enjoying this book. Much better than playing with an I-Pad all day.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|bring it back. I love this show too. kind of reminds me of my old days when I used to run with the clubs.
075669812X|5.0|Bought for my 5 year old (soon to be 6) He has spent many, many hours with this book. So much better than exercising his fingers on his I-PAD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You know what sucks about it, Nothing I totally recommend it to every one that wants to get it it may be $7 but it is worth it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run 2 is better than the first one by far. The big monkey is creepier than the little ones. I hope the Ravens beat the 49ers
030758836X|5.0|This was a page-turner with lots of surprises.  There was such a long waiting list at the library that I decided to buy it.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|So thrilled to have Rodriquez back in my life. I have been reintroducing him to the old folks and introducing him to all the young folk. Amazon stock up on this album because you are about to be inundated with orders.
B008X9Z37A|2.0|I've ordered better cases from china. This case is flimsy, thin and not well made. Out of all the Belkin cases, I dislike this one the most. I feel like this could easily get cracks on the cover. I'm not a fan of this at all.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Fun for the whole family :) Entertaining, funny and visually great. I liked the story line and hope there will be a #2!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|i love his voice and his talent to entertain.  the variety of music is also  very interesting and he has a lot of energy
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is a good game easy to win . easy to read the cards and the sound is not too annoying.
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|Great DVD and I received very fast and had no problem ordering.I love 24 and I love ordering here because it is easy and very fast.
B000EQ46FA|5.0|Was worth the wait 16 years for the remastered version, but finally available. One of the best albums of all time. The 2006 remastered is excellent, with a great sound without saturated sound, but far superior to the first CD release so far available, maintaining the coolness of the time it was released.<br /><br />The label publisher belongs to the band together with their own original label on Uk, Mute Records.<br /><br />A classic. Super recommended. See my pictures shared at the top. JASP.
B00132S74A|5.0|Well written. Easy read but very informative. Follett at his near best; he never fails to please, inform and engage the reader.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it, its there whenever you have a moment and wont unfriend you when your not! need I say more......
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I like how each character is worked sicologically and interacts with each other according to any given situation. Almost all types of personalities are present in this show.
B005PK1G76|1.0|Had a ridiculous time trying to attach this to my stroller.  Attempted 4-5 different positions.  None of them would hold my latte in an upright, stable position.  Feel totally taken in.  Really!!!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie! I am NOT a fan of glee, although this was hilarious and great music as well!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Great book<br />Thanks for the great book keep making more of the diary of wimpy kid books peace out home dog
B0095T3H2U|4.0|This was a cute romantic comedy! I would definitely recommend it to the ladies! The ending is predictable, although still a good movie.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Great read! You'll have trouble putting it down. I have always loved the chili peppers and loved reading Anthony's story
B007M45PMU|2.0|The majority of the songs were acoustic, which I didn't realize until I bought this. Still I like the Lumineers, so it's an okay album.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book is so good it is showing to sides of love. Both have never truely fell in love until they meet each other.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I loved this movie, although it is similar to family guy or southpark humor, so if you like those kind of shows, you will laugh your ass off!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great for young kids who want to be horse riders or are horse riders. This was great I love it a lot!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great suspense novel and the ending surely threw me for a curve.  There were points when I was VERY frustrated with the characters and the behaviors they exhibited but it was a book I couldn't put down!
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|I actually simply have this in reserve for an occasion when a grandchild is looking for something to keep busy.
B005UD1D62|5.0|I love LC's clothing line, accessories, blog and now her BOOKS!  Although this is very unrealistic for a normal person to live a life like Madison Parker or Carmen Curtis it sure is fun to read about it!
032147404X|5.0|If you've ever read any complicated explanation on composure and the scientific basis on how the sensor writes the image onto the SD card, then you're probably dying to have a simple, logical know-who into things experts do out of habit. From getting crisp images to baseball games to obtaining the perfect lighting, this book easily lays out what to do, rather than why it works. Also include is recommended equipment to purchase and different price ranges for varying budgets. Highly awaiting parts 2, 3, and 4's arrival!
B005DOKIYG|2.0|It does not fit my husband''s Kindle Fire HD. If I had known that, I would not have ordered it.
1600246133|5.0|The narrator inflected different tones distinctly to differentiate the various characters.. And you cannot go wrong with Nicholas Sparks;; his stories are always enjoyable to watch, or read.. This is my first audio book and definitely will not be my last!..  The discs were in good shape,, the outer package was well used but intact.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Love this series...arrived just as described. It was brand new and played perfectly. Definitely a good price for a good product.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite of mine.  Finally had to replace my VHS  for DVD.. The quality of video and sound is great and the package was in mint condition from the mail
B002S0KB1S|4.0|Good prtion of humor, lots of interesting stuff, specially from the start of the career. Wades a bit off towards the end, as it gets kinda repetitious on how many pills, how much booze on any day... Great read anyways!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|A fictional novel based in an IT environment, and well written as well. Does it get any better? It probably does, but this is an entertaining book.
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|Interesting visit to the world of one of my childhood's favorite rockstars. Missing a star for nagging tediously about the Metallica firing. The turn in the end is like a fresh wind in the book.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|There are more expensive cases but why pay the extra bucks for a case when Marware has such a great product?<br /><br />This is the second case I bought for a Kindle Fire HD and I am absolutely satisfied with the construction, the durability, and ease of assembly of each one. By 'assembly' I mean the Kindle simply snapped into the case. Easy peasy! Secure.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and company. Super.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Attended this show in Tallinn and would say it's probably the best live show I have ever seen. The film is no worse, top quality sound and execution of a rocked up version of Sade - good music, excellent show!
0765325950|4.0|I've read all of the books in the series, and re-read most of them as well. Before I started reading MoL, I pretty much knew how the ending should play out. Jordan introduced too many characters in the series to spend much time on every single one of them. So, I figured that MoL would come back to, and focus on, the main three.<br />Personally, I wasn't happy with how Mat turned out. With Perrin, I felt that too much time was spent with him fighting Slayer. I was hoping for some huge event with his hammer, too. And then there was Rand vs The Dark One. The engagement as a whole left me confused. I was wondering how the connection with Moridin happened and if the Dark One wanted to lose again.<br />So instead of going, that was badass, it was more like, ohh...hmm...ok. Everyone wanted closure, and we got it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is repetitive, boring hardcore pornography having no redeeming qualities.  A reader could read the first few chapters and skip to the final chapter to have the full essence of the novel.
B000GWE44U|3.0|Years ago my wife and I both watched this movie when it first came out. We also had just read the book,usually at night in bed. I remember it raised the small hairs on the nape of my neck. The movie, back then, even though not quite as horrific as the book, did its' job and sufficiently kept us both on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />Today we rented and watched it with a completely different reaction. There were long, boring sections of the movie (over 2 hours) which did little to keep the pace going. We are searching for scary movies for a group of 16 year old girls, (for a birthday party) who look for realistic &#34;could happen&#34; scary flicks to induce screams and clutching each other for support. Sadly, we scratched &#34;The Shining&#34; off the list. As we previewed it, my granddaughter remarked that it had way too much &#34;filler&#34; content. We had to agree. Scary, horror flicks riddled which almost graphic sexual scenes cannot be considered.<br />I remember when, at 17 years of age, &#34;Hush Hush, Sweet Charlotte&#34; had me enhralled and sufficiently frightened to have a few dreams about it. I didn't even suggest that one.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I have used a Spaceball 5000 since about 2003.  Picked this little guy up for my home office.  It works really well and I love the blue light ring.
0765325950|5.0|Spanning 14 books the series truly is epic, it is sad that the series is over.  4 more words required.
B007UK83S4|5.0|I purchased this book after reading a review in our local paper.<br /><br />I found his writing, intelligent and humourous, refreshing.<br />If on occaisions, in my opinion, got a little bogged down with muso electrical jargon.<br />I have no idea a small portion of this book relating to electronic musical equipment.<br />But, I'm not a muso.<br /><br />If you are a Who fan, as I am then this book is a must read.<br />I will keep it in archive, and reread at a later date.<br /><br />I sincerely hope his explanation of the terrible newspaper reports of the 2000's<br />are correct.<br />I have a feeling, this is a totally honest and innocent explanation of those newspaper reports.<br /><br />I believe this book is a very good read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is really fun. Definitely a step up from Temple Run&reg; or Temple Run Brave&reg;. I like this game a lot.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We love it.  Especially the bonus material..... 2 hours! All the episodes in UK Format. Can't wait for season 4.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Do you like math, physics, chemistry and electronics...then you will enjoy this story of a man marooned on Mars and the Rube Goldberg devices he has to engineer to stay alive until he can be rescued.
B00992CF6W|4.0|wish that there was a download button on the home screen for the game when it has a Jew update. loveee this game tho
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my friend had it on her ipod and i loved it! then finally the kindle fire got it and it is so addicting. love it and i recommend it for ages.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read most of Grisham's books.  The Racketeer was good, but maybe not his best.  However, very good reading
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the fact that you get to actually interact with the horse and compete with it makes it a fun game.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I gave this season 5 stars because you didn't need to see the first season of American Horror Story in order to understand this season but you will appreciate the different roles of last seasons actors a lot better.  This season provides a lot of twists and just when you think you've got it figured out you'll be proven wrong.
B00AZ7V0W0|1.0|I wish they would re-release the 8 disc DVD set in Blu-ray format, or at least give each movie in the franchise it's own disc! Its a timeless american cult classic. This franchise made New Line Cinema a lot of money... They should spend some money in return and give it the upgrade to Blu-Ray it deserves! It would sell better!
B004FUVEC4|5.0|Jeunet is a genius. If you liked Amelie, Delicatessen, and City of Lost Children, I think You will enjoy this one.
B008469DGY|4.0|Learning the intricacy of accurate strokes is a little challenging (what decent game isn't a challenge to learn well?), but I don't fret about long waits at the Dr office, Auto-Shop, or ??? I know I have something to keep my mind occupied while I wait.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Received it fast as usual when ordering from Amazon. Fits my new Kindle Fire HD perfectly and the strap is great for keeping it closed when I throw it in my bag. Glad I got it!
B009QBRVZG|3.0|I haven't heard this yet and that's why I give it 3 stars because I have some of thier earlier stuff and it sounds like power metal like it's supposed to but come on guys that last few albums have been wanting for real 'heavy metal' don't get me wrong but even Judas Priest sounded better but I will go bac to the old school stuff to get a fix of real heavy metal so if anyone from the band happens to see this I know Joey DiMaio says he's a soundman type person as witnessd in the extras on some of the DVD's that I have but he and they need to get back to basics. Even tough I know they are awesome in concert and louder than hell. \\"I want to see a full concert dvd version of the complete Asgard Sagas done in completeness as in a rock opera type atmosphere where the stuff really screams in the arena. Something similar to the Wacken Festivals done in Germany.<br /><br /> \\"That would really get my goat\\"!
B004J4WLPU|5.0|I think this was one of the best books I have ever read. The detailed writing was awesome. It was very realistic. I would recommend this book to everyone!
B0053XM7ZU|5.0|Fantastic!! As good as the first in the series. Gripping from start to finish with lots of major events. Cannot wait to get the next one!
B009SQRL4U|3.0|Rented this for Christmas and found that Christmas and Santa could bungle just about everything. The jealous son who would be Santa. The turmoil within the North Pole! Brother I didn't sign on for this! Any Who its okay.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book in one day, definitely could not put it down.  It was beautifully written, and touched my heart.  It has lingered in me since I closed its covers. I have re-read the last few pages several times, to absorb the beauty of this book.
B000000OSE|5.0|Growing up I was only allowed to listen to country music gospial ' carp.... the first rock music I heard was guns and roses &#34; paradise city&#34;  a friend let me borrow the cassette tape cuz I just had to hear the rest of the album (appetite for destruction) . But  I only could listen to the tape at night with my pillow over my cassette tape player just load enough to hear it. Threw the pillow . So guns n roses is my #1favorite rock band
1432794426|5.0|This is a wonderful book showing Michael as a kind and loving human being.<br />It make me cry and smile at the same time.<br />I highly recommend this book to all of you. You'll learn more about the global icon, legend also more about the man. Michael Jackson changed history, and his influence is all around us. His life is worth understanding.<br />Thank you Dr.Moriarty
B003TSEEDY|2.0|This is a book about high school from the view point of a socially challenged and emotionally unstable high school boy. I could not relate to his  awkwardness.  He was writing the letters to someone, but we never found out who.  I am sure some could relate to this story and those that could probably enjoyed it more than me.<br /><br />At the end of the book there are discussion questions - so maybe this is the book that high school students read and discuss to talk about the challenges of high school - from that view point this book may have value.<br /><br />But as a 30 year old female - looking for a fun read.  This was not it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This must be the best thing on Television that I've seen in years. Love it! Gritty, Riveting, Tense. A must see show for anyone who loves to watch characters react to each other and the world around them.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Don't waste your time or money.  Poorly written, poorly edited.  To have the same experience, get your ten year old neighbor boy to film a scifi movie written by him.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|A lot of other reviews have done a great job of capturing the essence of the story, so I just wanted to say that this film is a great way to spend an hour and a half.  You will probably end up watching it twice (I rarely watching things twice but this is different), and you will probably tell friends and co-workers what a great movie this is.  There are many stories within the story - Rodriguez' story, the men who searched for him and to some degree the nation of South Africa.  I knew absolutely nothing going in and had no expectations, but am much better for having seen this film, and that is more than I can say about a lot things!  Don't hesitate, and don't worry about the fact that it is a \\"documentary\\" and not the lastest action thriller, you won't be sorry!  The 90+ \\"5 star\\" reviews on Amazon (as of this writing) are not a gimmick, this is the real deal.
B009O07NDY|5.0|This is very nice to listen to.  Bought it for son who loves everything LOR, and he said this is better than just the regular sound track.  Easy to order and by online through amazon.  would recommend this.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|It's an O.K. case, Would not have been my first choice, but considering the price, it's fine.i would have liked one that the cord fit to charge it on the left side.
B0001I561E|4.0|My children grew up the the VHS version that wore out.  My kids wanted a copy for their children and this could not be found any where but through Amazon.com.  Very good buy for Christmas with the free shipping. Very worth it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't say enough great things about this show.  I love it.  Gets better every season.  Can't wait for next weeks' episode!
1569242739|5.0|I got this for my college-age daughter, who is a Vegan.  If you're Vegan, you have to mostly do your own cooking, so I'm helping her start her collection of cookbooks.  We took some cookbooks by this author out of the Library this summer and really liked them.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I had no desire to see this when it came out, but on Amazon Prime I watched it 4 times just to catch all the nuances and really enjoyed it overall. The music (70's) and acting were good, but there are several instances of subtle adult humor, so be careful watching with the younger ones or questions may abound. Adults and fans of the &#34;Dark Shadows&#34; TV series will get a kick out of it, but don't make the mistake of comparing the two. While there are a few overlaps and carry-overs from the series, the movie is a stand-alone interpretation. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp make interesting twists and they've delivered another witty 're-imagining' with &#34;Dark Shadows&#34;. Michelle Pfeiffer, Eva Green, and Helen Bonham Carter play their parts well, too. Watch with an open mind expecting nothing and you won't be disappointed...you may even enjoy it like I did!

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I remember the first time that I saw this movie and I will be showing it to some college students that I work with. I hope they get as much out of it as I did.
B006H5120E|5.0|I watched the 3D version in the theater, and this set does not disappoint! The features and array of old material brought back for the Blu-ray are satisfying.
0316056898|4.0|Perhaps the book caters to women more than men but I just wasn't enamored by this one. There were a few spots where I laughed out loud but for the most part the reaction I had was a smile or slight chuckle. I actually think the book would be a lot more enjoyable via audio CD or as a stand-up comedy show. Hearing Tina herself talk about the experiences would make it a lot more enjoyable. That's not to say I didn't enjoy parts of it; the stories behind her comedy career, including Second City, SNL, and 30 Rock, were very interesting to read about. I also enjoyed her thoughts about raising children and managing a staff of workers. I'd give this one a read if you enjoy Fey's work or want a short book that will make you smile.
0316056871|5.0|This book is laugh out loud funny. I was disappointed when I finished it. Would have loved another 400 pages of this book. I don't often re-read books, but this is one that I definitely will.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|BRAVE IS A VERY GOOD ANAMATED FILM ,A VERY GOOD FOR KID OF ALL AGES WITH A HAPPY ENDING ,WORTH  SEEEING

B000N2HBSO|5.0|Wonderful book!  Of my favorite three history books: War and Peace, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Lincoln's story by Doris Kearns Goodwin is now my favorite. Now I am addicted to my Kindle Fire! Thanks, Doris.<br />Five stars!
B004H7QICG|4.0|This does a great job of quieting down your computer components.  With the front door swung open, you can hear the parts more, but that just shows how well this case dampens the noise.  The fans that came with the unit are fairly quiet when set to low; the high setting does sound quiet a bit louder, but what do you expect.  The trays for the drives & peripherals are nicely designed and easy to install.  I definitely like the USB 3 on the front.<br /><br />The few small gripes I have is that with a large graphics card installed, there is little room to connect drives in the two upper Hard Drive shelves.  The upper shelf does hold 2 HDs and is ready for small SSD drives (nice design for that).  The bottom Hard Drive shelf can hold 4 SATA spinning drives.  I like that layout.  In a way, I wish Antec put the power & reset button outside of the door as opposed to the power & reset button being covered when the door is closed.<br /><br />Do be aware that the PSU goes in the bottom compartment, which is separated from the Motherboard, graphics, peripherals, etc., and you should probably get a power supply that has a straight fan intake/exhaust like the Antec CP-850.  I think the 90 degree air flow of most PSUs may be a problem with this case.<br /><br />In general the air flow capabilities for this case seem very well thought out.  I have had no heat problems whatsoever with this case.  I like this case.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Fantastic movie, classic Firefly humor/pacing. After 14 episodes I finally got to see River kill, well, everyone. Just, all of the people. Amazing. Even now, we get more depth of the characters. If you watched Firefly, it's a must. If you haven't, you should give it a try. It's worth the effort. Thanks again, Joss Whedon.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This temple run is so much better than the first! All the characters are so lively and the image is so clear! I would definitely recommend this app! I adore it!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|1. This game is amazing.<br />2. It's my favorite game.<br />3. I also love pets.<br />4. Little pet shop has a lot of cooo animals.

B0096DFBZQ|3.0|It's an OK game but locked characters really? Namco you can do better.<br />You should at least let all characters be available to everyone.
1400079276|5.0|One of the conversations in Kafka on the Shore goes this way:<br /><br />\\"It's not something you can get across in words. The real response is something words can't express.\\"<br /><br />\\"There you go,\\" Sada replies. \\"Exactly. If you can't get it across in words then it's better not to try.\\"<br /><br />\\"Even to yourself?\\" I ask.<br /><br />Yeah, even to yourself,\\" Sada says. \\"Better not to try to explain it, even to yourself.\\"<br /><br />That's the way I feel about this book. I really can't get it across in words, and I really can't say exactly what it means, even to myself. The meaning is like the truths revealed in dreams, which seem graspable for a moment but then slip away like sand from between the fingers. To report the plot is akin to saying that Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis is about a man who turns into a giant bug. But here goes, anyway, in the interest of information to those who have never read this wonderful novel.<br /><br />The chapters alternate between two stories: that of a runaway teenage boy who is escaping a (perhaps) abusive father and the Oedipal prophecy that he will murder the father and sleep with his mother; and that of an old man who is simple and cannot read or write due to a mysterious wartime occurrence. Their paths converge, as both are propelled toward a seaside city by mysterious forces. I forgot to mention, the boy awakes one morning covered in blood and later discovers that his father was murdered hundreds of miles away on the same night. I also forgot to mention that the old man can converse with cats and cause fish and leeches to rain down from the sky.<br /><br />All of this sounds like something that China Mieville or Neil Gaiman would dream up, but their books are to be taken literally, just set in alternative times and places. Murakami obviously intends for his story to be taken metaphorically, and his time and place is present-day Japan. Mieville and Gaiman both provide amusement with their imaginative creations. Murakami provides enchantment, and a dream-like state where profound truths are almost graspable.<br /><br />I read that the Japanese publishers of this novel invited readers to submit questions to the author in an on-line forum and received a reply of 8,000 questions. That makes me feel better, as I am evidently not the only one left puzzling about the meaning of the book and not the only one passionate enough about it to want to understand more. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket addition is great it has many features of normal minecraft as well as new features like the nether reactor or stone cutter.
0060853972|4.0|Take a premise borrowed from the novel and movie The Omen, about the birth of the Antichrist; add a little sharp Twain-like satire about religious fanaticism, new-age fads of the week, and various other human oddities; spice with a generous portion of the Hitchhiker's Guide/Monte Python type of British silliness. The result is Good Omens.<br /><br />The baby Antichrist is supposed to be substituted for the newly born baby of the American Cultural Attache' to Britain, but Sister Mary Loquacious, a Satanic Nun of the Chattering Order of St. Beryl, messes things up and mistakenly gives the Son of Satan to someone else. Now the scheduled time for Armageddon is fast approaching, and the angel Aziraphale and the fallen angel and Satanic representative Crowly must locate the now eleven-year-old Antichrist so that the final battle between good and evil can take place. The only trouble with this is that neither one is sure he wants the end of the world. They have come to like humans.<br /><br />This novel is irreverent, sometimes keenly insightful, but mostly it's just silly, wacky, outrageous, etc., etc. It's fun to read, but you can forget it immediately afterward.<br /><br />Two bits I particularly liked: audio tapes (now it would be CDs) left in a car for more than two weeks all turn into The Best of Queen; and when Marvin O. Bagman got religion, it \\"was not the quiet, personal kind, that involves doing good deeds and living a better life; not even the kind that involves putting on a suit and ringing people's doorbells; but the kind that involves having your own TV network and getting people to send you money.\\"<br /><br />I don't believe I have ever laughed out loud so often while reading a book.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|LOVE this app!  Based on the current charge in the battery, it shows how long: I can listen to music, surf the Internet, watch videos, read books or documents, play games, or the time it will take to recharge my FIRE back to 100% via AC or USB charging.  One of the most useful apps so far, and one I access almost daily.  I highly recommend it for any tablet user.
0812984412|5.0|Some writers can write character dialogue so believable and true-sounding that a reader can forget he is reading the words of a made-up person. Some writers can tell such an interesting story, with all the necessary suspense and pacing, that a reader is compulsively impelled to keep turning the pages. Some writers can include philosophical and ethical ideas in a novel that cause a reader to think about the implications long after the reading is over. Some writers can successfully invent new forms and methods of telling their stories.<br /><br />David Mitchell does all of the above, all in Cloud Atlas.<br /><br />On the surface, the novel contains six linked stories, with half of each of the first five given first, then one central story in its entirety, followed by the second half of each of first five in descending order. Confused? It goes like this:<br /><br />Part 1 and 11 is a journal account written by Adam Ewing, a young notary on a sea voyage in the 1800s. Mitchell writes this portion in the style of Daniel Defoe in Robinson Crusoe, and, indeed, it begins with the finding of footprints in the sand of a South Sea island.<br /><br />Part 2 and 10 is told in the form of letters from young composer and all-around rake Robert Frobisher to his friend and lover Rufus Sixsmith in 1931, as Frobisher is working for (and stealing from and cuckolding) the ailing master composer Vyvyan Ayrs.<br /><br />Part 3 and 9 is a third-person thriller in the pop-fiction style, taking place in the 1970s in California. The heroine, Luisa Rey, is a plucky young journalist, who is alerted to the potential dangers of a new nuclear facility by Rufus Sixsmith, one of the scientists who worked on the project, reappearing from the previous story.<br /><br />Part 4 and 8 is a comic tale set in the 1990s about the publisher Timothy Cavendish, as told in a first-person memoir. Imprisoned by his brother in an old-folks home, he plots a daring escape with some of his fellow \\"inmates.\\"<br /><br />Part 5 and 7 jumps to the unnamed future, in a question & answer session between the clone Sonmi-451, who has been sentenced to immolation, and an unnamed Archivist, who is recording the interview. Sonmi-451 has been created to work in Papa Song's restaurant (which resembles McDonald's more than a little) in a world dominated by corporations, where clones are used virtually as slaves and viewed as less than human.<br /><br />Part 6, the central story told in its entirety in one entry, takes place in an apocalyptic future, as an oral story told by Zachry about his world as one of the most \\"civilized\\" tribes of the residents of Big I (Hawaii). Into his world comes Meronym, one of the Prescient who have tried to keep civilization and learning alive.<br /><br />All of the above are absorbing stories in their own right, but wait, there's more. All are connected in some way. Frobisher from 2 and 10 finds a copy of Ewing's journal (from parts 1 and 11). Rey from 3 and 9 finds the letters written by Frobisher (parts 2 and 10). Cavendish from 4 and 8 receives a copy of the story of Luisa Rey (from 3 and 9)as a potential manuscript to publish. Sonmi-451 from 5 and 7 views a film made from the memoir of Cavendish (in 4 and 8). And Zachry, in 6, views the holographic record of Somni (5 and 7) in an orison given to him by Meronym.<br /><br />But wait, still more. More than a few clues hint that some of the characters are reincarnations of previous characters, the most obvious clue being the persistence, from character to character, of a comet-shaped birthmark. In the central story, Zachry says, \\"Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies, an' tho' a cloud's shape nor hue nor size don't stay the same, it's still a cloud an' so is a soul. Who can say where the cloud's blowed from or who the soul'll be 'morrow?...only the atlas of clouds.\\"<br /><br />More than obvious is the larger message, that history seems to repeat itself endlessly. All the stories feature the themes of human greed and the urge to enslave the less powerful by the more powerful. Not a very uplifting message, except that the last paragraph (as written by the part 1 and 11's Adam Ewing) indicates his vow to fight slavery, even though he is only \\"one drop in the ocean.\\" He says, \\"What is any ocean but a multitude of drops?\\"<br /><br />Taken all together, these parts add up to create simply the best book I've read this year.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I've used eBay for a long time.  I bought myself a Kindle FIRE for Christmas, and added this free app fairly quickly.  Yesterday, I bought my first auction item using it and it worked very well.  The app is well designed for use with a tablet; maneuvering around &#34;My eBay&#34; was intuitive - no frustration with &#34;where IS that function/menu?&#34; like some other apps; the PayPal site was easy to use also for payment.  Go for it, all you eBay-ers out there!

On the main screen you see a 'clockface' with the current time, as well pictures illustrating the forecast conditions for the next 12 hours (sunny, snowing, partly cloudy, etc).  Other areas of the screen show barometric pressure for the last 24 hrs, moon phases, sunrise/sunset times, wind, hourly forecasted temps, etc.  Tabs will show earthquakes around the world, radar maps, weather alerts, and more.  I access this app daily. Check it out in the app store!

The only thing I wish they would add to the app is a snow /rain fall estimate. I work in the winter doing snow removal and it would be nice to know how much snow fall to exspect over night. Other than that, I would recommend this application to everyone looking for a &#34;better than most&#34; application.
B00AG51V8E|3.0|With so many action films and stories that deal with intrigue, especially ones that include terrorism, it is not surprising that there are a number of hits and misses. THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY has the feeling of a tryout for a television series (note the lines at movie's end when strangely, Colm Meaney addresses Henry Cavill with the concept that perhaps Cavill has performed his mission so well that he consider taking on a new life job...). The story as written by Scott Wiper and John Petro is flimsy and the direction by Mabrouk El Mechri is incompetent, yet despite this the film holds our attention throughout its 93 minutes of lack of substantial plot. The reason may just be that finally we get the opportunity to look at the handsome Henry Cavill for an hour and a half.<br /><br />Will (Henry Cavill) is reunited with his family (Bruce Willis, father Martin, Carolyn Goodall, mother Laurie, Rafi Gavron, brother Josh, and Emma Hamilton, Josh's girlfriend Dara) in Spain for a vacation, though he is absentminded because of work issues back in USA: is small business has gone bankrupt. On a family outing on a sailboat Dara is injured and Will returns from a short trip to get supplies only to find the boat and his entire family missing. Someone has apparently kidnapped them and holding them hostage. It turns out that Will's father is not who he believes him to be. With the stakes high over a mysterious briefcase, it becomes a chase of cat and mouse without knowing whom to trust. Will discovers things about his family - his CIA agent father had an illegitimate daughter Lucia (Ver&oacute;nica Echegui) who of course is Will's sister, and his father was involved in a scheme with agent Carrack (Sigourney Weaver) and her sidekick Gorman (Joseph Mawle). The rest of the film is chase scenes with Will and Lucia in constant danger from Currack and apparently Israeli terrorists.<br /><br />Of course you know how it is all going to end before it is barely started. The script is very thin, the direction is a bit silly, but the personalities on the screen hold it all together on their looks and their chops.  Not a bad film, not a good film, but worth an escapist watch on VOD.

1616550414|5.0|This book is the culmination of my entire life of Legend of Zelda fandom. I played my first Zelda game at such a young age that I can't remember a time when it wasn't my favorite gaming franchise. I own and have played every canonical Zelda game, and this book is really just icing on the cake from Nintendo. I'm perfectly happy just buying every Zelda game that's released, enjoying the story, musing over how it all ties together, and then waiting patiently for the next one (or in all likelihood, re-playing a couple of the old ones during the time between). Even though I don't play as many games as I used to, I just can't help picking up every new Zelda adventure... I guess it's one of the few constants in my life.<br /><br />This book shows that Nintendo has a vested interest in fans who have grown up with their games and stories, and those like me who have spent hours in Hyrule exploring forests and dungeons and caves. It's not just an art book, though the art alone is worth the meager purchase price. We get insight from the people who have spent significant parts of their lives bringing us these adventures, letters from Shigeru Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma, and an excellent manga from Akira Himekawa. All of this comes in a beautiful, elegantly designed hardcover book at an insanely low price for what you get.<br /><br />The timeline is interesting and, though it might seem odd at first, well thought out. A large section of the book is devoted to the History of Hyrule and explaining how each of the legends tie together and weave into alternate realities. Even though it's fairly clear that not all of these games (especially the older ones) were made with any sort of connected universe in mind, it's kind of neat to think that future installations might be crafted to fit into the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />If you're a Zelda fan you owe it to yourself to have a copy of this book. You wont regret spending the twenty bucks. I feel like I got much more than my money'sworth.
B002O4JAV0|5.0|One of my favorite albums. The sound isn't like anything I've ever heard, but has a blend of sounds that come together beautifully. While 'Day 'n' Nite' will probably be one of the few songs that folks will like to listen to by itself, the rest of the tracks come together perfectly. This is definitely an album you will have to sit down and listen to all the way through to fully appreciate. Highly recommended.
0756404738|4.0|If I had any sort of complaint about this book, it's that the main character, Kvothe, is constantly overpowered and a bit too good at everything. However, when considering the fact that he's telling his own story and could be lying or embellishing, I kind of appreciate the idea that there's a whole other layer of potential deception to the story.<br /><br />Anyway, the writing is good and I'm constantly impressed by the world Rothfuss has created. It's a good sequel for The Name of the Wind. I can't wait for the next one. That is all.

B003IWZ1D8|3.0|I would definitely recommend buying the Blue Ray Edition vs. DVD. The picture quality is terrific. However, though the voice track is fine, the viewer should be prepared for some disappointment when listening to the musical portions of the film especially, the opening Bernard Herrman film score. This famous opening sequence has very little bass and is lacking in brilliance and depth.With the incredible technology we have today to enhance sound, I would have thought Universal would have spent more resources on improving the sound quality of this film.

B000FZESY4|5.0|No band appeals to me more than Opeth.  While this is not my favorite album of theirs it certainly is great.  I've been known to listen to Baying of the Hounds (in the distance...I hear them devouring) several times in a row and by far name it my favorite track on the album, with The Grand Conjuration a very, very close second.  Hours of Wealth and Isolation Years, while showing the amazing diversity of the band, fit in with album as a whole despite the vast difference in structure and vocals from the rest of the album (except maybe the bonus track Soldier of Fortune which has grown on me since first hearing it).  Not sure I'd recommend the Special Edition with DVD unless you're actually going to watch it.  I was lured in by the bonus track and am happy I got it.

B0041D843M|3.0|The information is amazing, however not only is it a hard read, but the basic principles are repetitive. The essence of the book can fully realized in the first and last chapter. Read the middle chapters in order to see the evidence and proof. There is a lot of it.

His communication is universal, and though men may not be able to tell exactly what it signifies that they feel that it is important. He is supremely normal.<br /><br />-W. Somerset Maugham, \\"The Summing Up\\"<br /><br />I read Maugham's little autobiography of a book \\"The Summing Up\\" in early 2009. The quote above struck me as unique and amusing. Late 2011, when i was reading Jobs biography, i found myself kept on returning to this quote.<br /><br />The world's perception of Apple's recent success (starting with ipod) was due to Jobs' design genius, and his consideration for his users. But reading the biography, one realized that is a lie. Jobs couldn't care less about users. 99.9% of us are nothing but moron's in Jobs mind anyways. So how do we explain this conflict of superb received design and Jobs condescension of common men?<br /><br />The only explanation i can think of is that Jobs wasn't designing for the users. He was designing for himself, period. And it just happened, his taste has the mass appealof a genius. Using Maugham's metaphor, most of us have our own little quirks. What we like don't translate to what most others will like. But Jobs happened to have the \\"appeal that is not to this type of man or to that type, but to all men.\\"<br /><br />On top of that genius, Jobs is probably the most persuasive deal maker silicon valley has ever seen. iPod, even with its gorgeous design and superb craftsmanship, would have still failed if Jobs weren't able to secure those deals with record companies. That kind of deal making is what makes Apple stand out among all other tech companies.<br /><br />The rumored Apple TV would be a good case to watch.

0061450162|4.0|I'm a borderline geek. But i don't usually go for books that a true geek loves.  I picked up this book by accident and enjoyed reading it. The writing flows well.<br /><br />The first half of the book was truly a pleasant surprise. Creative, original, good writing, and interesting stories. The best part was how Gaiman mixed realistic modern life with magic and fantasy. I loved that. His prose had good rhythm, they ran smoothly like a beautiful river.<br /><br />My favorites are the one about the black cat (\\"The Price\\"). \\"He looked like a small panther, and he moved like a patch of night.\\" and the one about Hollywood âaeThe Goldfish Pool and Other Stories\\". Or rather, i liked the courtyard in \\"The Goldfish Pool and Other Stories.\\" The main character's friendship with the old black man. Their talks of past stars in that quiet courtyard. I always imagined there were leaves on the ground, damp and colorful, and the wind of the Fall blow through the desolate scene. All that used to be glorious are no longer, except the three gold fish running around and around in circles...<br /><br />The other ones that I would recommend are \\"The Wedding Present\\", which is hiding in his introduction; \\"Chivalry,\\" \\"Troll Bridge,\\" \\"Murder Mysteries,\\" and \\"Snow, Glass, Apples.\\"<br /><br />These are cleverly written. Rich in originality and beautiful or tender imagination.<br /><br />The rest fell back into the category of fantasy that i don't care for, werewolf, vampire, and unnamed creatures took over something, someone, or someplace. The Stephen King stuff that would sure make you fear and sick to your stomach.<br /><br />I also like what he wrote in his introduction, about writing.<br /><br />\\"Writing is flying in dreams.<br />When you remember.

Angle it right and a mirror becomes a magic casement; it can show you anything you can imagine and maybe a few things you can't.<br /><br />Stories are, in one way or another, mirrors.

B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved it !  Haven't read a really good book in a long time.  This book was great, could not put it down.  The chapters jump from 1941 to 2011 and I found myself hurrying to get through one chapter so that I could see how the past chapter continued on!  Loved the story line and the fact that it kept you guessing all the way up to the last chapter of the book.
B007JQLNXG|5.0|When I heard that Peter Gabriel was going to be revisiting his catalog with a classical orchestra, I thought, &#34;Not another tired retread, please&#34;.  It wasn't and it may be one of the best Gabriel records ever done.<br /><br />The orchestration brings out the nuances like never before, place even more emphasis on his voice and the lyrics.  I have been listening to some of these songs for 30 plus years and it was like hearing many of them anew as if for the first time.  Not only does it bring out Gabriel in a way that I never heard before; he also makes room within the songs for the musicians to shine...and shine they do, there is not a note out of place.  This is as close to being as perfect a record as possible.<br /><br />It is truly an outstanding live recording, one that has instantly earned a top place among my more than 2000 discs.
0375869026|5.0|This was possibly one of the greatest books I've ever read! I enjoyed reading from the few different perspectives, it added a more round dynamic to the story. I won't describe the book because plenty of people do that, but I will tell you that this author was on point with the children's dialogue and emotions. It was almost as if she could depict every child's smaller scale fears into Auggie's fears. Great read and I would recommend this book to ANYBODY over 10 years old! Do yourself a favor and  give \\"Wonder\\" a chance, you deserve the treat!!!

The pictures look good enough to eat and make me want to make what I see. So many other cookbooks don't show pictures of every recipe. Visual appeal is just as important as the ingredients when deciding what to make for a meal.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Epic conclusion to the most recent Batman Saga. Features a lot of familiar faces (Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman) and brings some new commonly featured Batman characters (Catwoman, Bane, and a hint toward another). Although it is a lengthy movie, it demands your attention the whole way through, you won't want to take breaks. lots of clues given to the die hard Batman fans, like myself (hopefully it doesn't make this review too biased lol). Like I said in the title, hate that this is the end of Nolan's Batman movies, but man what an epic ending! Any Batman fan should have already seen this movie in theaters, and to all those not into Batman, you're missing out on an saga, you should definitely check them out!!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I got this ap on my Kindle Fire and it works just as well as it does on my GS3. The only issue I have with it is that it automatically tags words I am writing. If I try to keep writing without tagging whoever or whatever the ap suggests, the word is deleted. I have to try to quickly pick the word from my suggested word list if I want to write it. I have had no issues with the newsfeed as previous reviewers have complained about.
B000063V8R|4.0|The DVDs were in fine shape.  The box they came in could have been in better shape. but it is a used product, not new.  Overall, very good.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I found this incredibly bleak, and the characters unlikeable. The subject was mostly about filling a council seat, and the politics involved in these unloveable character. Everyone was trapped in a situation without hope of repreive.
B0000046JP|5.0|paco de lucia is greatest maestro of all. just wonderful and perfect perfromence. i love it very much and thank you.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|This game took forever to download and then it was horrible to play. I felt like the computer cheated too. Definitely not the game for me
B007IXWL2C|1.0|It's good if you are in to things like succumbing to your husbands every wish and becoming a rich trophy wife/door mat.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very Fun! Love this game.. I recommend this game to you. Both temple run and temple run 2 are great games.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|This series is awesome.  The DVD is great and even includes a black and white version of the first episode. The character commentary is cool too. It was a present for my dad he loved it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing for many reasons. the picture is great the sounds are funny and realistic. I love the fact that the game tells you a story and you were put right in it. I play this game for hours and I cant get enouph! They would make a third one. :)
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have been playing World of Warcraft for over 7 years and never had a headset sound as great as this one. Nothing gets past me or sneaks up on me anymore. The surround sound makes  the big difference, as well as the over sized ear pads and the muffling of background noise. I have and will recommend this head set to everyone. gr8 price also
0743246616|5.0|Great book! Great recipes! You won't be disappointed if you buy this book for your home! These recipes will make your family happy!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's fantastic :) I still love the first one but this one is just much different. I think it's all around good.
0684859106|5.0|Happy with my purchase! Everything I'd hoped for! You won't be disappointed! Great recipes to make for your family and or friends!
B009738XXM|1.0|I bought this Mp3 album on a whim when it was $1.99. Since I had heard \\"Call Me Maybe\\" and enjoyed it, I figured I'd give it a try. Well I want my $1.99 back! All of the songs (except for Call Me Maybe) are REALLY over produced. This girl has a great voice no doubt about it but it seems as though the songs have the same beat and lyrics. It's overwhelming and not worth the $8.99 it's selling for now. I seriously tried to like it but I just don't. The more bearable songs are Wedding Ring/Guitar String and Good Time.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|If you don't agree then I am going to have to get some red phosphorus on your butt! This season really brings out the bad in Heisenburg!
030716327X|5.0|I have bought this book in the past.  As each of my grandchildren were born I purchased this book for them.  They all loved it as did their Moms.  This purchase is for a friend's daughter who is expecting.
B0023SDPS6|3.0|Often the speaker was only identified after a lot of dialogue. That interfered with getting the characters at first. Good who dun it...but no way for hero to make two trips from mirror lake carrying a grown man each time in the story line allotted...guess that's the way with fiction.
B00004RFFS|5.0|i might have been about 7 or 8 when i first seen this movie but from the first time i see it, I knew it was one of my favorite movies. back then i was never able to remember the title so i would wait until i randomly caught it on HBO and thne gett all giddy. this is where my love for vampires started and now that i'm an adult i've read this and other books from the vampire chronicles by Anne Rice and i love them. This set  standards on vampires for me and why i could never in a million years get wih twilight.<br />despite Anne Rice not liking the film herself i'm smitten with it and have been since my first encounter so long ago.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a fantastic gem of a book, about how one could possibly survive against all odds. This book is good, so good that I would like to give it 6 stars if possible.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|i cant think of one thing. From the day my best friend got me to watch it. i was hooked. this is a must see classic. AND THEY BETTER NOT EVER REMAKE IT!
B009CGYO0K|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. You have to get it, it is so funny. You will love it
B004KKXMSI|5.0|This is just as good as I remember it being in the theater! My kids and I enjoy family night with this treasure. A great addition to your collection.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my name is boo boo da foo and I aprove this application. it is very fun and really cool to play when your bored.
B00004W5A6|5.0|OK this is a review of the 30th anniversary Legacy edition of \\"Texas Flood\\" that was released today January 29th 2013. First of all DO NOT GET RID OF YOUR 1999 REMASTERED CD! The little interview segment and the three live tracks found on that edition are NOT on this new 2CD Legacy edition. Cd 1 is the origional album + one bonus track \\"Tinpan Alley (AKA The Roughest Place I've Ever Been)\\" taken from the \\"Texas Flood\\" sessions and released on the 1999 edition of TF. CD 2 is most of a previously unreleased live show from 1983. The sound quality on both discs is excelent. The packaging (minus the plastic slipcase that used to accompany these Legacy editions) is excelent. I don't have much else to say, accept that if you love Stevie Ray Vaughan's \\"Texas Flood\\" album as much as I do you'll be glad you picked this up I hope this review has been somewhat helpful enough for you to make a wise and informed perchase. Thanks for reading. PEACE!
B009FZFONO|5.0|The whole series is awesome I can't wait to watch the rest of season 3. I hope that the following seasons are just as good as the first 3!!
B004OKFISQ|4.0|Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\" is one of the greatest albums of the last thirty five years, and it's been a personal favorite of mine for almost that long. Every track on the original album plus the B-Side \\"Silver Springs\\" are all classics, and most of them have been FM radio staples since the late 70's. Disc 1 of this 3-disc collection is excelent, especially since \\"Silver Springs\\" has been put at the end of the album instead of being inserted right in the middle of it! With the acception of the DVD audio the sound quality on disc 1 is as good as I've ever heard \\"Rumours\\" sound on CD. Disc 2 is part of a live show recorded in 1977. Here's where the \\"but...\\" in my review title comes into play. With an approximate length of fifty nine minutes there was plenty of room for more live material. There are several bootlegs floating around from 77 that are considerably longer than disc 2 of this set. Disc 3 is a collection of studio outtakes from the \\"Rumours\\" sessions. These are different outtakes than the ones featured on disc 2 of the 2004 Deluxe Edition of \\"Rumours\\" and so they're worth getting this edition of \\"Rumours\\" for. The packaging is very nice. You're gonna have to be a little careful when taking the discs in and out of the cardboard holder because the discs are held in tight little pockets that are part of the foldout instead of plastic CD trays. My only other problem with this CD is that I can't seem to rip any of the discs to MP3 or any other digital format. Now, since I bought and payed for this music for the fifth time already I don't see why I can't use it any way I want to. I do not agree with DRMs at all, so I took off one star from my overall rating of this otherwise five star product. \\"Rumors\\" is also available in a \\"Super Deluxe Edition\\" that contains all of the material found in this 3-disc version along with an additional disc of outtakes, a video documentary and a digitally remastered vinyl copy of the origional album. So in closing, I highly recommendpicking up this 3-disc edition of \\"Rumours\\" ASAP. Just be aware that you may have dificulty transfering it to your digital music player. I hope this review has or will help you to make a wise and fully informed perchase. Thanks for reading. PEACE!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have parental controls we don't know who put them there can't get out love temple run 1 looking forward to it though
B004EPYZSK|4.0|This is a good movie to add to my collection. Something I can watch with the grandkids, The plot is a little crazy and not one of the best movies made, but for the price, entertaining.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a very fun game that is even beter than the first everyone should buy this game it is awesome.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|In the same vein as ET and Encounters, entertaining, quick paced. I enjoyed this movie and will watch it again. Glad to have it in my library.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Blew me away!  Watched and listened 3 times in 3 days.  WOW! Simply amazing quality and the most amazing musicians on planet Earth.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is awesome if you like caring for animals this is fir you. I wish you could wash the horse though
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I bought this cover because I didn't want to spend upwards of $40 on a leather cover.  So far this cover is great.  I haven't had any issues with the standing option so far, and unlike some of the other reviewers, I've been able to charge my kindle with the case closed successfully.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Haven't had a chance to view the DVDs yet, but the CDs have not left my car player since I got them.  Of course, I saw the movie when it was released the first time, so I know what to expect there ~ incredible renditions of classic Zep songs live.  The bonus DVD is a gift I have yet to open...<br /><br />ZepHead
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I have always liked the Bourne series.  This movie is no exception.  A lot of good action just like the previous movies
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|It worked fine yesterday but now when I try to walk I can't. I used to before.... so 4 stars.
B009K0P10K|4.0|very intrigueing and captivating story line.  gets bogged down at times with the soap opera mentality.  but worth seeing and following.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the graphics are amazing. the new obstacles are a great challenge. I am totally addicted! how could anyone top this?!?! :)
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|While amusing once you get to the ?puzzle?, it seems like you have to chase your tail to find the appropriate location.  Could be much more user friendly by better incorporating navigation into the game.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|I like to be able to call for free, and to be able to call Canada  I have a Granddaughter living there..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a highly addictive game so if you ever want to put your kindle and or phone down again don't get this game it will cause your device to permanently become part of your hand. However on a serious note highly recommend  this game well with the time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have loved it and I think it is the most popular game in the world<br />I love it very much
B007BFSYMS|5.0|JMy husband downloaded this app for me and I never thought I would use it, but This white noise app is absolutely wonderful. Sounds are unique and real and not a repeated recording that starts over. There are some interesting sounds on this app that sets it apart from others, such as a cat purring, railroad tracks, and the sound of a vacuum.. along with your basic water and wind sounds. Although I must say they don't have just 1 rain sound but 5 different levels of rain. I love falling asleep to this app. I am so glad my hubby downloaded it for me!!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|The original and the best. Immensely watchable. Amazing content and brilliantly scripted and narrated. Anybody with an interest in WW2 should watch this series.
157421327X|5.0|For anyone who is interested in another artistic expression in paint or thread this gives options and ideas for designs & projects.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I know this book would be as great as his others but i like how he draws from his pervous books to make this one more compete.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Some episodes are better than others, but each one leaves you wanting more. Well developed characters and multiple, but equally interesting, story lines. A very entertaining and thought provoking.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Great headphones. For not a lot of money, these are great headphones with clear, crisp sound and good bass. They fit very comfortably. I've been able to listen for long stretches without the usual headphone fatigue. They are open enough to hear what's going on around you while not diminishing the music. All in all, a nice product.
0385341008|5.0|This book is written in letters that go back and forth about the past. It was very enjoyable and you really don't get lost, another one that my book club suggested.
B00956UPSW|2.0|I've been a big fan of this band since NOLA was first released, but they seem to have fallen into a songwriting rut after II. Levitation and Witchtripper are cool songs but the rest I found underwhelming.
B0085G0DH6|5.0|This is a great recording highly reccomended. It is nice that they come back with great music such as this.
B00B780TAK|3.0|The last episode is supremely depressing. They have had success incorporating tragedy into the show, I suppose that encouraged them to push it further. But with each successive tragedy becoming greater than the last, they over-reached in the end.<br /><br />I do not see myself watching the next season, if there even is one. In my mind the show has no further value to me. They had some great writing in this show, but they ended on such a sour note, it spoils the whole experience.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I finished this powerfully written book in less than two days.  I completely lost myself in the pages.  It was all I wanted to do.  Safe Haven is a wonderful, suspenseful, page turning love story and you can't help but fall in love with all the characters!  I cannot wait to go see how it is portrayed on the big screen....Sparks has outdone himself once again, and I thank him for it!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I had no idea about this book when a friend suggested it for out book club read. The title was just enigmatic enough to pull me in and from the first paragraph I was hooked.<br /><br />A quick read but a layered story that unfolds with the journey, I too took a journey with Harold and was happy to do it. I enjoyed the book and will recommend it to friends.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The reader became emotionally involved with the characters in the first book and it carried through the roller coaster journey of this book. It highlights the emotional damage of guilt and the healing of forgiveness.
0345803485|1.0|I began my perusal of this book because I had been reading Les Miserable and wanted to take a break from it and read something a little more simple....and boy did I get my wish.<br />To start the writing is on a fifth grade level. I have never in my life read anything that repeated phrases as constantly as this. I suppose I should give E.L. James props for finding a thousand different ways to describe lip biting and jeans hanging off people's hips. Another thing Miss James, we are all adults. I can't stand that genitalia is described as \\"down there.\\" Also, they are called condoms, it is okay to print the word condom. I'm imaginative, for all I know those foil packs he's been pulling out of nowhere could be Cadburry Easter eggs or Reese's mini cups. Please, just use big kid words from now on.<br />Even the characters are painfully vapid. Ana is supposed to be a college student and going into a career in editing? Her subconscious is tedious and her inner goddess laughable. Speaking of inner goddess, where exactly did hers come from? Up until this point she had no sexual experience and then loses her virginity and goes at it all the time afterward. The fact that she incessantly is having orgasms is baffling. I was half expecting, \\"so I looked at my caller ID and saw Christians number and let myself shatter, not caring that I was in the middle of lunch with my mother.\\" This character altogether is ridiculous, I see no independence in spite of the repetitive allegation that she is unable to be submissive.<br />Now on to Christian, the big ball of sex himself. He is so agitating. The character puts me in mind of a petulant, horny teenager. He seems more like an abuser in general than someone that engages in BDSM. My knowledge of BDSM is limited and I admit that, but I have had the chance to read Ann Rice's Sleeping Beauty book and that seemed to be much more sexually erotic and enjoyable. Christian Grey just seems to like to hurt for his controlling nature rather than sexual pleasure. Also over usage of the phrase \\"laters baby\\" is annoying and also supports Christian's portrayal as a teen aged mentality. The man happens to be in his twenties and is a self-made billionaire, plays concert level piano, dances, flies planes, endeavors to end world hunger and who knows what else will be revealed in the next two books. He is unrealistic and even for his obvious fictional persona is completely unenjoyable.<br />Lastly I'd like to address the sex scenes. There was nothing erotic in the sex whatsoever. I feel I can make this judgement soundly in spite of my little knowledge of the BDSM because I've engaged in almost all the types of scenarios the characters had sex in and done more than that and have also read the Ann Rice books. They just have sex all the time and its always the same. Apparently Christian is quite talented for the above mentioned constant orgasms. Also Christian doesn't need any recovery period in between sex as well. The birth control thing annoys me as well. Why and how is it that a girl in her twenties is not at least knowledgeable about birth control? They start having unprotected sex right after she begins taking her pills, which does not give it time to become effective.<br />In short, I hated this book.
B00A3K2PZA|5.0|If you enjoy films on the edge. Then this is the film for you. Dyfunctional family, twisted cop.ending with actress Gina G.in the weirdest scene on film. A really good indie film.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My 4 year old grandson is able to play this and it would entertain him for hours on end if I would let him.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|For anyone that is been following me for some time you know how much of a fan and my family is when it comes to Disney and their movies. As you can probably guess, we were very excited when we heard that they were re-releasing Peter Pan from their vault. You see, my kids have never seen this movie as of yet, they have heard of the movie, but they have never seen it yet. With that in mind, when we received it, we went about making some family popcorn and sitting down for a great film (IMHO). My kids were spellbound. They loved the movie. They particularly love the fact that the kids were able to fly, and they actually hope themselves to be able to fly one day as well. They also loved Tinkerbell (as they had seen her before in her own movies). All-in-all and my kids  love the movie and wanted to see it again the next day. The movie itself was very well made and I love that the fact that there was a previously never released a song within this version.<br /><br />*I received a copy of this movie for an honest review, but the receipt of it did not change the review you read above*
B008MEM24S|4.0|I ike it because if you are board this is a game to play. I just like it because it is just good game but not a great game that is why I gave it 4 stars!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it. It's great when your on the road or just bored. I think it's a big advancement from the old one.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|i very much liked this book and i would recoment it to all my friends who like syfi... shiver was well worth the read
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Derp y u ask me to review i just bought this. Seriously though i love this series i hope its good
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is in all ways an upgrade to temple run they improved the graphics made a better monkey new obstacles more interesting Terrain thats less repetive then before and added a second currency that does not need to be bought.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I Don't want to worry about having nightmares after reading a book... wife abuse is Not pretty and quite scary since it is too widespread.  I certainly didn't expect this in a Sparks novel...won't see the movie either.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|when I got this app, I was highly skeptical. the other hungry sharks had only 3.5 out of 5 stars. but this was a star higher! I wonder what had made the difference, so I downloaded it.<br />what I found was that this game is AMAZING!!!!<br />it gives you the option to how you want to control, has much better graphics and is overall very fun. there are different sharks, all of which are designed well and match the atmosphere. I like that they keep realistic quality's of each shark, like how the reef shark can only travel to a certain depth. this leaves tons of replayability.<br />I love this game, and is now one of my favotites.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I just loved this book. It took me less than 24 hours to read slammed and point I'd retreat... I can't wait for another Colleen Hoover book comes out. Just amazing!!
B0021L8V0M|4.0|Always did like Jolie, amazing how she can do all those stunts. Solid Entertainment. Plot in this one was good but visible from the start.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is amazing.... I read in less than 12 hrs. I have now read all Colleen Hoovers books and they all are just as exciting as the rest. Ty Colleen for writing such wonderful books.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|good producto,,, buen precio,, rapido envio,,, excellente servicio, empaque adecuado no muy grande y si pequeño,<br />buena comunicacion e informacion del articulo
B00785P2QC|5.0|A really fun game that I enjoyed playing. Normally id take away stars for bribing you to review this game but you could give it any review so idc.
0545265355|5.0|good producto,,, buen precio,, rapido envio,,, excellente servicio, empaque adecuado no muy grande y si pequeño,<br />buena comunicacion e informacion del articulo
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I can sum up my review for this album in one short sentence.<br /><br />I absolutely love everything about this album!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one of the first games we got on our kindle because my kids had played it on a friend's device and wanted it.  It has been the most played game since Christmas.  Would totally recommend this game.
B006ZZQH4W|4.0|Very enjoyable quick read. Struck a cord with me as I could see myself in a similar position.<br />Mrs Binchy never disappoints.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|The kids like this game some.  It is not one they play a lot, though.  They like how he copies what they say, but I don't like the fact that every time you touch the cat, he acts like he is hurt.  I don't want my kids to think that it is funny to hurt animals.
B009LROCJI|5.0|I can't say how much I love this album. I'm a big classical music fan, so I'm biased in that respect. I love the patterns, the melodies, the ebbs and flows of the whole album. It's fantastically done--familiar yet different at the same time. My only wish is that it were longer!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This Is by far the best book I have read ever I'm absolutely in love with the way the author portrays life from a distant but yet close perspective the best part is I feel like I could really relate to Charlie this was a wonderful book and I truly do feel \\"Infinite\\" for reading it.
B0062NAVXA|3.0|acting leaves something to be desired but a good story. I watched it on netflix and bought two copies for my daughters families
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've been a professional typist for many years, and for the last probably 8 I've used these headsets exclusively. They are the loudest, most comfortable and cheapest imaginable.  I started out with hard, heavy cover-the-ear ones and always had headaches (not to mention yucky hair!). I tried these once and have bought many sets from then on. I don't know what I'll do if Sony stops making them.  I even wear them upside down (hanging down under my chin) because they are so light and comfortable, to avoid the dreaded hair problems. They are the loudest earphones I've tried in this category and I've just never had a problem with them.  Taking them on and off many times a day, I would say their longevity from messing with the cords constantly isn't years and years, but I'd still only use them in a heartbeat even if they were four times the cost.  Starting a new pair today! (They probably last me at least a year or more)
B002RXVOX0|3.0|I love Laurence I think he is beautiful. The sound was a little off but other than that a great watch for a rainy day.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I'll play this during commericals while watching TV at night. Easy to follow and lets you feel like you can really play the piano.
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|This is a silent appreciation for this film, never in my life have I seen a silent film with such a story.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I liked this movie very much,especialy how at the end ,where it looks like the new cop may take over the roll of the Batman.
B0019LZV4E|4.0|This movie is a monster, a big huge musical Monster and I love ever song and ever little cheek that come with it
B00APUQPX6|3.0|This movie is okay. Seems like each Ice Age after the first is never as good. This movie has some funny parts and is not bad just kind of weird with all the different actors voices but all and all it's an enjoyable movie.
1451696191|4.0|I love this book, I have since it first came about. This book is in great shape, and no writing in it.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read it had a lot of suspense, action and a good story. At some points though it was a little hard to follow. I would recommend this book to a teen boy who likes action stories.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|This album is great! Its Exactly what I thought his first record would sound like! Can't stop listening on repeat!
B0017O1MIM|5.0|the picture was so clear and on my big screen tv it was like being in a theater(but smaller). I would recommend this to all my friends.
B00785P2QC|2.0|This game is fun but the goals are a little ridiculous and the time it takes to complete them makes it annoying.
B008XGFZRQ|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over!  Love it - It's funny, scary, and silly. Would recommend it to anyone
B004SBULWE|5.0|I just love this - always shuts down everything for me with ease and assurance that it is done<br />thank you
0521653975|4.0|Actually it's not required for the class. However, I believe it can be very useful. The idea is super. Whoever interested in the building of your word power, you should get it.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|This is not the best but it is not the worst either - seems to be doing a fine job
0521664357|4.0|Cool book! In addition, I got an awesome instructor. It's a fantastic match. I will make a full use of it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|As others have mentioned, this app can really wake a deep sleeper.  I've basically retired my alarm clock and use this app exclusively. Haven't slept in yet (knock on wood). I like the portability of the app too.  It is easy to set the alarm before taking a nap on the couch.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Really like this because you can play without buying coins with real money.  You can put the app away for awhile and build up a stash to use when you log back in.  Love it.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|very moving. Tells how the real world is and how dangerous it can be. With a 17 yr old daughter myself this was very eye opening. Every parent should watch.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I wont go into how great this book was, as the other reviews did it more justice then I could do. However, did anyone read the copyright info that said the entire book was to be public domain and could be redistributed to anyone as long as its FREE?? Yeah, it was only 99 cents but that is still 99 cents that Amazon made illegally off all of us, none of which went to the author.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|great family movie to watch with the kids. This was a good sequel to the originals. I would watch again.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|This is a good movie for fans of sifi and suspensful movies and the alien films. And overall good movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great game. Good time passer and great for kids. looks very realistic<br />I would recommend this to anyone who would enjoy an interactive game
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|It is a good movie but it is the same as the original trilogy. But still a solid action movie.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It's a shame you need to purchase in game to continue with the story.  I would like to see pricing before clicking anything.  I disabled in-ap purchases for a reason.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|made me cry - listening to the story of someone's life through a dog's eyes was very entertaining.  Would recommend this book
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|My daughter loved reading this book and all the other books in this series. She finished it in one day witch is great considering she wasn't much of a reader before.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I am very close to Alice's age, so I can somewhat understand her feelings.  The first book in a long time that each member of my book club made it through and enjoyed.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show seems to be getting better each year. I must say it started off with a bang.  The first episode is so worth watching.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Product arrived timely and was very well packaged.  Exactly as described.  Great collection of Christmas music. Will listen to this cd for years to come.
B004OZNS2E|5.0|I Love This Movie...Excellent Actors This Movie IS ONE THAT  Will NEVER BE REMADE SO WELL ....WAY BEYOND IT'S TIME ....FOR A LONG TIME MORE !!
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|I stumbled across this duo on YouTube and was blown away by them.  Her voice is sweet and his is breath taking.  Combined they are a 'must hear' duo.  I wish them many years of success!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a great game but after awhile it is boring. It is also very addictive game. I recommend this game for people who get it because  it is fun
1439102813|5.0|I've always worried as I've become older and more forgetful that this will happen to me.  An almost comforting look at Altzheimers, as this woman was fortunate enough to have a very supportive family.  Written with a great deal of insight and compassion it was hard to believe it was fiction.  I couldn't put it down.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|I gave it this rating because you can only take pictures from the front-their is no way to to see what you are taking, when you point the camera away from you.
B0041KKYD8|4.0|dont want to tell you the plot of movie. This writer gets her revenge. I had saw the movie before and liked it so much i purchase after i saw it
B000094HMU|5.0|What a treat: James Levine, Franco Zeffirelli, Placido Domingo, and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus together! The staging and costumes complete a most satisfying experience of Puccini's last opera. My Chinese-American granddaughters- ages 8 and 11 were enthralled with the performance as well.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is the best book ever it is funny, fun,true,and awesome if you like diary of a wimpy kid or any other book like diary of a wimpy kid.  BUY THIS BOOK
B00000IBVC|5.0|Unfortunately, the version sent to me was apparently a European DVD, so I could not view it (I was reimbursed quickly). I have viewed this performance in the past, and I loved it! What a trip to see the Imperial Palace as a setting for the last of Puccini's amazing operatic scores!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a free app and has so many options to pick from, it is a terrific option for background or white noise, you can play things together or individually.  I really like it and don't need to be looking for any others, this does it!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The book continues with the rest of the series very well. I enjoyed reading it and am currently reading book 5.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a terrific and complete free app.  I like to be able to check the weather for my area, so it is dependable and complete.
B00B16WZBE|5.0|I attended an Animal's concert without Eric Burdon a number of years ago. The lead singer was young and could belt out a song out, but he lacked the soul and depth of Eric Burdon. In short, the music just wasn't the same nor as good. 'Til Your River Runs Dry doesn't sound like the Animals either, but has a sound unique to Eric Burdon. He sings with the soul and depth of a person who has experienced much in life.<br />Even though his voice isn't the same youthful, driving voice he had when he sang with the Animals, he can still sing like nobody's business, and now his voice has a richer, more nuanced, blues sound. This album has great songs sung by a master, a singer who understands the music.<br />P.S. For those of you who have never listened to Eric Burdon and The Animals, you have missed out on one of the all time classics of Rock'n Roll. They put the blues in rock and I love the sound.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is exactly the type of alarm I was looking for, not too fancy and easy to use.  The digits are just as you see, big and blue, so easy to see in the dark.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|seems to still have some gliches that should be fixed, but they aren't major just super annoying<br />but I like it better than the first one
B001NEK2GE|5.0|works great. i use it for WoW and startcraft 2. joystick is nice and comfortable. feels &#34;alien&#34; at first but you get use to it. love the macros
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is amazing and I'm so glad I got it. At first, I thought it  wasn't as good as the first one said that there were some things I liked better in the original but soon realized that there are things to love in this one, too! Now I can't stop playing it! I am officially hooked.
B009AMAMF2|5.0|Let me start off by saying two things:<br />1) I am a film student, and as such I tend to go into movies with a broader perspective. I tend to appreciate the art of the project, as well as the execution of the film.<br />2) I read the novel Cloud Atlas before I saw the movie, therefore I have a full understanding of the story and it's concept.<br /><br />*There are a few small spoiler alerts, so do not read if you do not want minor details given away*<br /><br />This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. The Wachowski siblings and Tom Twyker have taken an amazing book that was said to be unfilmable and adapted it into a masterpiece. And dare I say it, this is the first movie I have seen that I may have liked BETTER than the original novel. While it follows the original story accurately, the small adaptions they made only added to the plot. For example, in the novel, I was disappointed to find out the Ha-Ju Im was working for the government all along and that everything Son Mi had been through was almost a haux. In the film adaption, they did what I would have done, changing his allegiance and cementing his love for Son Mi. They also omitted the daughter of composer Vivian Ares, which only helped strengthen the relationship between Robert Frobisher and Rufus Sixsmith. All in all, the changes, in my opinion, were well received.<br /><br />Now as for the film itself, the editing is simply artistry at it's finest. It is sequenced differently than the book, intertwining all the stories. I understand how those who do not know the story could get confused. It may take more than one viewing to absorb it all. My best advice to those people, is if you like to read, read the book first. Or find a friend who can give you a basic synopsis of the story so yo don't get lost here and there. That is where the negative press from this film comes from, those who do not understand the stories.<br /><br />I would keep a few things in mind when you see it. First, while the characters souls are connected, not all of the stories are. You will see a few people reoccur in one story or another, but try to watch each as it's own plot. If you try and connect ALL the dots you will confuse yourself, as it is not necessary to do so. Also, the filmmakers PURPOSEFULLY wanted each actor to play a different character in each segment, therefore turning them into men, women, of different races and ages. The did this without CGI, just costuming and make up. You CANNOT let that throw you when you watching. It is amazing to see the work they do, especially when you can respect the art and skill behind it. Doona Bae, who is not only Son Mi but plays Adam Ewing's wife, is very obviously NOT a red headed white woman. But if you put that aside and see it the way they are trying to tell the story, that she embodies the same soul (the same person), without over analyzing the make up, it all very much makes sense.<br /><br />All in all, I applaud the three directors for their cinematic achievement. The 10 minute standing ovation at the Toronto Film Festival was well deserved, and this movie has been sorely underrated. Ignore the ignorant columnists who tell you not to give it a chance. The message of the film is a happy, hope-filled one: All things are connected, and love and passion can conquer all.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Awesome book I love it has a great ending and the author should be a multi billionaire I love it again
B006OCM0G0|1.0|If you decide to buy something, you won't get your purchase immediately, you have to wait a day or two. That's what support tools me. This is crap to me. Don't get it
B0007DFJ0G|1.0|This movie was the most weirdest movie I've ever seen , I could'nt understand nothing about the movie at all &#62;
B00873GRU4|5.0|This page turner is different to anything else I've red.<br />Good story, amazing setting. Makes you wonder what lies ahead.
B006YM9JSW|4.0|well everything in my pc scored a mark of 7.9 other than the prossecer =( so now my score is down.. lol kidding im not that worried about a score.. it seem to be running fine no over heating. i also used the thermal paste that came with the unit...
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I liked doing the goals except the ones where I have to download and get to a certain level on other \\"story\\" games. Also I think that the holiday edition should be automatically included in the game already for storage purposes. I love the game. Just a few suggestions.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you have the first temple run, well stop playing it and get temple run 2. This temple run is so much different. When you start you souse down a zipline. You also get green diamonds. If you die you, you can use these to revive you. This temple run is so much better that the first one.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|Perhaps it is suited for a younger user.  I am new to.Kindle and was curious about  some of the free apps.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|With this app you can not only see what level your battery is at, you can also see how much more time you can listen to music,  search the web and more. You can also set alarms to the tell you the level of your battery.
1400067936|3.0|I can see why there are so many mixed reviews on this book. It is a very smart book, it is thought provoking and it does give several interesting angles on certain things, but my God how arrogant this guy is. Throughout the book he pretty much mocks everyone that he can think of (from Newton to Soros) from a bias point of view, without considering other elements that determine a success. And his unnecessary complex style of writing gives the impression that he's trying too hard to be recognized as an intellectual, thus sometimes make the book exhausting to read.<br /><br />Nonetheless, true to his central theme of randomness, he can present a random range of pretty interesting topics, while providing a lot of excellent examples to back up some of his fine theories, such as the ones about \\"survivorship bias.\\" And actually he can tell engaging stories, although most of the concluding analysis ended up being an anti climax. But what is up with his long list of \\"references\\" at the back section of the book, while claiming in the introduction that he \\"detest the practice of random use of borrowed wisdom.\\" Do I smell a hint of hypocrisy here?<br /><br />In the end I don't even know whether I like or hate this book, but one thing for sure, this is a book with an attitude. Ultimately, this could easily be a key reference for those who are strongly believe in Random Walk Theory and Efficient Market Hypothesis.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|Maybe Pixar has simply set the bar too high for itself, as Brave is an okay movie. However, I found it to be more childish than usual, and lacking in any significant character development or plot, unlike most other Pixar movies.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I will remove this from my kindle as soon as I figure out how to remove it.  I cannot get the game to open.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I understand that this is a Batman movie, but the plot has some major holes in it that were too unbelievable to not mention. Also, they could have probably cut 45 minutes out of it and it would have been just as good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game.  Lots of fun.  I have had it on my phone before, but just downloaded it to my kindle and it is a blast.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Don't second guess just get it! Awesomeness awaits you!!! A little more challenging than temple run 1 but that adds to the amazingness!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Read this before the movie comes out in February.  It is an awesome book.  Of course, everything from Nicholas Sparks is awesome.
B005HSL626|3.0|its a great game to keep my 2 and 3 year olds busy long enough to do a quick chore or two but i got bored pretty quick
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|i wanted somthing close to mario  brothers  and then i found this and its a hole that better then i expected!!!!!!!!:)
B00AVTMCYW|3.0|Why is it that not everyone with every type of device is able to download? Kindle Fire only?! Make it downloadable to everyone on this type of purchase and I might do it again. Otherwise, goodbye.<br /><br />The film is good.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought this was beautifully written prose. Delicately insightful and hopeful when you would think it over.<br /><br />It was my favorite of the three.
1742677495|5.0|marked is really cool if your looking for a series of books that will keep your interest for a long time to come and the series is called the house of night for people who have not read them yet all i have to say is you will love this series
034580404X|5.0|This was a nice set of the fifty shades trilogy at a good price, I haven't had a chance to read the books yet but when I do I will update the review.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|We love this movie as a whole family.  It is funny, and also has a subtext relating to social commentary.  We could watch it over and over again.
B009HELT3C|5.0|The picture was very good via streaming. The movie itself I really enjoyed. MIB3 is a great ending to the trilogy.
B006X415GK|5.0|I buy several of these Monster High dolls during the year. My niece's really love them. They have quite a collection of them. They always look forward to the newest addition.
0545265355|5.0|Nice looking set and the delivery was fast.  The books are good and I am happy I ordered them. I am almost done with the second book.
0671449028|5.0|I love the Boynton books and characters, and this book is very cute.<br />I would recommend it. Young children will love this cute story.
B00110K62U|5.0|Great movie, it was wonderful the best of the best performing my favorite musical what could be better than that? anyone who likes Les Miz ,will love this maybe everyone should purchase this
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|you cant even download it it is dumb you need to fix it you should not by it if you do your dumb you cant even play it
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good for the second book. I read it 2 times already.  The only thing I thought was bad was how she kept on knocking out her self.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I was at a crossroads of where we all stand in this life.  This story of faith was perfect to allow me to get back on track to believing in people again. Noticing random acts of kindness in everyday lessons.  A truly inspirational read.
B008LUM25M|4.0|Nicely written, very fast paced fantasy action where characters are plunged in an incomprehensible world full of dangers. Lack of resolution at the end is a bit disappointing, but, as it is the first volume of a trilogy, I trust the writer will provide more insights about the characters in the following volumes and that loose ends will be tied up.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is very addictive! I love to play and it fills the time I should be studying. Great for teens and up
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Through a captivating and richly written narrative, Erin Morgenstern Night Circus is a perfect allegory of the opposition between the conscious and the subconscious mind.<br />Not only is the Night Circus suffused with magic, it is black and white and the circus protagonists change into colorful clothing when interacting with the rest of the world, and their ageing process is not in phase with that of the non-circus people.<br /><br />The steady pen of Morgenstern takes the reader on an enchanting journey, never letting the reader down.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|This is a novel written with great delicacy and an extraordinary understanding of human nature and of the essence of love.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Worked right out not too much trouble to set up. great app works well on my Motorola xoom. I would definitely recommend.
034580404X|4.0|The first book was really exciting, but as I got into the second book, it was kind of boring and repetitious! I definately didn't care for the third book! The ending was rather lame!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the book, was very hard to put it down, have not seen the movie Hunger game, but plan to rent it soon.
B009A87ZQU|4.0|Glad to see them finally make a movie of the first Bond story ever written - Casion Roylale.  Daniel Craig plays the Bond part more like what was originally written and it looks like he is going to be a great fit as the new Bond!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was a great resource!You should choose this dictionary it really helps. It helped me on so much! Use this dictionary!
B009A87Z6U|5.0|Daniel Craigs returns as Bond and does an even better job than Casion Royale, but that probably has more to do with Quantum of Solace having a a few more action scenes and a little more suspense in the plot than Casion Royale.
B00ARPMIJE|1.0|It was a bad book.<br />It was horrible and I can't say any more or I will die because it is so so bad
B0062P332Y|4.0|Killer Elite is a good movie, but I expected it to be a little better since it stars Jason Statham, Robert De Niro, and Clive Owen.  Despite falling just a little short, it's still a good buy.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|If you read 1st book you must to read this one, The plot thickens a follow on. Good twist to the story.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Tom Hardy is becoming a hell of an actor.  I guess it helps when you star in a movie that has a great story and great fight sequences.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|If you can get past the sex this has a good story line.<br />Don't think the sex had to be quite so detailed.
B003IMMEKG|4.0|For those of you considering buying this disc consider the following:  The disc is an import and the disc is Region B.  You should consider this before buying, but I have a Samsung Blu-ray player (Model BDP1500) that is about 6 years old and the disc plays just fine for me.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is an awesome book from the series and I give it a five star rating for a book it's really good
B00B2V66VS|5.0|you should totally get this app.it is awesome.it is fun interesting and awesome.and it is free which makes it even better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is awesome some I have it on my phone any time I want to play .if your reading this u should buy this game
B00884GR0W|1.0|this game is just terrible! id rather buy PE Minecraft its only a little bit more expensive and way better
0525953728|3.0|The book was an interesting read with the description of  the training done by the Seals.  His telling how he came to be on the team selected to capture/kill bin Laden and how that assignment was carried out gave some clarification to the story reported by the media, although not much amplification.  It was not great literature, but glad I read it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I absolutely love this book it was a real page turner and I fell in love with the characters instantly!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|as always... g5 games are amazing and this one totally delivers!  Just hard enough to keep me engrossed for hours.  beautiful graphics and fun challenges!
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I LISTEN TO THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN - ACTUALLY I GET ON MY WORK OUT WEAR AND DANCE TO THE ENTIRE DVD AND MAKE IT A WORK OUT.  I LOVE IT.  I LOVE THE BEE GEES.  THEY DID A TRIBUTE TO ANDY - BUT NOW THEY HAVE LOST MAURICE AND ROBIN - SO I HAD TO GET IT.  IT IS A PART OF HISTORY!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great game love it! BUT!!! you have to wait FOREVER for the updates to come to the kindle fire! i would give 5 star but that ticks me off with the updates.
0062107062|5.0|From the first page to the last this book is an amazing story of the life of a true American Hero. Great Book! Every American SHOULD read this!
B008XG1X18|2.0|Here there area different ideas on crafts and home made soaps and lotions. I have found it to helpful for me.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I'm a pretty big Tegan and Sara fan. This album lives up to my expectations and will be staying in my CD player for months to come.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said. If you have ever lived in a multicultural apt. like I have you will even appreciate the story line even more. Perfect from start to finish.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I thought this game would be a piece of cake to play.  NOT!  It is the best matching game I've played.  Challenging - addicting - no glitches on my Kindle fire - just plain fun.  I hope you will give it a try.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addictive but so much fun.  The games are challenging and some downright difficult but all are possible if you look at them from a different perspective.
B000CNE092|5.0|you can't go wrng if you purchase this movie. family  and friends will enjoy this film.  The movie arrived quickly from the company i purchased it from...5 star.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so additive that I wake up playing it.  its not like its action packed but getting the rewards makes me want to play everyday.  the best thing in this game is the giant coin dropping.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book is great! I orginally just bought it to try it out on my new kindle, and i think i like it so much more because its electronic convience
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this is a very fun game that will keep you hooked for hours I really lime thar its a few different games all in one game
B006AN78XS|3.0|I liked the story of this writer meeting some of the most famous artists and writers of all time in Paris at the stroke of Midnight.  Let the magic begin!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Love it! It was  really funny in the beginning, then it got to where it was just....o.k, but at the end like 50 pages it got really hysterical! You should read this if you like funny stories that you can't put down. I'm in fith grade and all the kids in my class loved the diary of a wimpy kid books so I thought I would give them a try and I like them......but they are still not as good as some other books. You better read this book<br />  P.S. I READ THIS BOOK IN FOUR HOURS DON'T GET IT IF YOU THINK IT WILL BE A  TIME-WASTER....ACTUALLY JUST READ IT ANYWAYS,YOU WILL LOVE IT!!
B00ARAO720|4.0|Stunt bicycle work is fantastic.  Joseph Gorden-Levitt is top notch!!  I would recommend this movie to any action/adventure movie buff!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was so saddened at the way Seaon 3 ended though I can see how it will add so many new ways for the direction of Downton to move.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A wonderful story and well worth watching.  It is full of faith and hope and would inspire any viewer who watched it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Run. Jump. Slide. Grab. What more can you ask for in a game! This was my first experience at 'the temple', and I am well pleased. I highly recommend this game to anyone who remember the old school Nintendo games!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book and the whole series! Can't wait for the next movie to come out! I couldn't put these books down I read all three in three days.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I always enjoy Follett's work. My only problem is that he grabs me,  robs me of sleep, and distracts me form everything else until I turn the last page.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book and the whole series! Can't wait for the next movie to come out! Read all three books in three days. Couldnt put them down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was by far my favorite Nicholas sparks book! I fell in love with Alex and Katie the way Jo wanted us too.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I've enjoyed all the walking dead seasons, but this is a rare series where they get better and better.<br /><br />Can't wait until it starts up again!
B0078XFYDA|4.0|It took me a while to realize this was a book aimed at younger readers; nevertheless Dawkins is a masterful explainer and does a terrific job at deconstructing complicated subjected into understandable bite-sized pieces.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The more I use it the more I add to it!  Automatic syncing across all my devices is a great time saver and insures I am always getting my most current info and updates.  No more paper notes!
B0072NWKEC|5.0|I like a mix of history/film noir/clever writing so I really enjoyed this.<br />It's not for everyone but Philip Kerr defined this genre and is the clear master of it.<br />I found it to be a truly fun read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season was another great BBC production.  I watched all of the remaining episodes yesterday.  Thankfully Bates was FINALLY released from prison!!  Mathew's death was a shock!  It would have been nice if he had the opportunity to be around for at least one more season. One death per season of a prominent character is enough, in my opinion.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|EASy to use. Fits well and protects my kindle.  The battery lasts a decent amount of time.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Entertaining, good movie night movie.  I haven't read any of the books so it was suspenseful for me.  Even my husband enjoyed it, I am looking forward to more installments.
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|I am a huge fan and love the rich timber of Bocelli's voice. I was not thrilled with this cd or the arrangement of most of the music - I thought for a minute I was listening to a smooth jazz album.  His song choices could have been more romantic and his renditions more Bocelli like.  Still it is Bocelli and not much he does can be rated poorly.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|My little girl liked this movie, and I thought it was cute.  I would recommend it as a fun movie night.
B001NLKWLW|3.0|Great quick summer read. A nice play between generations and periods in history.  I'll read more of these Kate. Thanks.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|This is a great CD -and a great movie!  I would defintely highly recommend both to any one of my friends
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I like this game alot and before I know it have spent hours playing.  I would recommend it highly too.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Loved this music.  Price was right and was delivered on time .  Husband was delighted to find this prize waiting for him when he arrived home.
1401322786|5.0|Great book, great delivery. I would recommend it, for sure. I had a nice time with it, even though he had better ones
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Found this to be a great book. I liked the love story between the two characters.  Now I want to read all of them!
B0002HWJY6|5.0|The little cottage is really cute but I thought it is a bit small for fitting the smurf figurines inside; the smurf figurines can't really fit through the door, but you can lift the roof to place the smurf inside (fits about 1 only). The roof just rests on top of the body of the cottage so when my 3 year-old takes the cottage around with her, the roof comes off all the time. I wish it was attached more firmly. Also, the dragonfly on top of the roof doesn't really stay put either. The tail sticks into a hole on the roof but unless you glue it down, it will just pop right off if you move the cottage around, like my daughter does.<br /><br />The paint job is great, and the material is sturdy enough for a toddler. The door is a working door so it will open and shut, and latch. It's a great toy to have and my toddler absolutely loves it. We have so many figurines from Schleich and they definitely make quality figurines.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|A friend thought I would like this book after telling him about how much I enjoyed Life of Pi.  I can say while it was not a typical book I would read I enjoyed the new perspective it gave to me.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great throw back game. This is a must have if you played the classic game. Get it, get it, get it!
B0043RSK3K|5.0|This explains so much about life in the United States.  One of the things that left a huge impression on me was the testing of returning soldiers after WW I and the lessons drawn by Madison Avenue as a result of those, granted rudimentary, IQ tests.  That was the beginning of the &#34;factless age&#34; in advertising which eventually led to the &#34;factless age&#34; in American politics.  This is a must read if you really want to know what ails America and why we seem to have lost the ability to solve our problems.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|One of the funniest movies made! We watch this in late November/early December as an annual family tradition. We always rented, but decided to own it instead.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved This book. I thought it was better than 50 shades of grey. I will definitely recommend this book To all my friends.
1620402963|2.0|I chose this due to the fact that it will be on TV, but I felt the writing was not up to the standards that I would expect, and the storyline was weak.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|The repetition can drive you crazy.  Highly predictable and lacks sophistication that one expects merely from the subject matter if nothing else.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|My husband has had a healthy obsession with the music from this film....watching it on TV every time it is on. It finally occurred to me to buy the soundtrack for him to put onto his IPOD (that's another story, but I digress.)  Not only did this CD please him immensely but it also served as the catalyst for him to actually learn to use his IPOD. The price could not be beat.  I'm coming back for the Out of Africa CD soon!
B001TODCII|5.0|Not family friendly, but opens our eyes to what really happens in this world. Great acting and happy ending. Can't wait to see the next one.
B005P89F1C|5.0|I love this cd so much, and I hear it all over the year not only on christmas &#60;3 lksdjcvkld
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Loved this movie and the message it shows my daughter. The colors are so brilliant and the animation is awesome! I would recommend this!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game drives me nuts, but I really enjoy playing it. My grandaughter got me hooked with her game, I got my own Kindle Fire from my children for Christmas. It is addicting , frustrating, and a darn sight better than watching the television! It's good for my hand-eye co-ordination, lets me take out my frustration on the silly monkeys & pigs, and I love beating my grandaughter's scores!!!
B00A80SHFM|3.0|The soundtrack is great, but they cut short most of the songs, which was really disappointing. I understand it says it's the highlights but i was expecting the full track of the songs listed on the back.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|love the game hate the pop-up ads. I didn't realize the game came with ads or I would have gotten the regular gameand . Hey, I'm 66 and have seen enough ads to last the rest of my life! But the game is fun and I love beating my grandaughter's scores!
B004E547D8|5.0|Loved this movie!!  It was so much fun to watch and the action was perfect.  A good blend of humor and action.
075669812X|5.0|This was a book requested by my son for Christmas and he loved it. I'm happy if he's happy.<br /> ;)
B00006AFF5|5.0|we love Christmas movies but this is definitely the whole family favorite. everyone should own a copy never gets old
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The author has completely captured the tragic feeling of a heart brake. It made me cry because I can relate to it. This book spiced up my bedroom manners, a bit ...lol
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is fun. It's a good game to play when your bored. I really like how they always give coins no matter what you do. Like if your stuck on a game they give you rewards for trying. LOVE IT!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I thought this would be a simplistic game for my kids to play, but I ended up obsessively finishing every level, then playing again until I had all the little crowns.  This is a wonderful brainteaser game.  Some of the levels are easy, while others are pretty complicated.  You have to not only collide all the smaller puddings into one giant pudding monster, but that final monster has to end up in the right place.  One wrong move and your pudding goes sliding off the screen and you have to start all over!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|AWESOME! I HAVE THE FIRST THREE SEASONS AND CAN'T WAIT TO GET THE FOURTH!<br />I WAS  A LATE BLOOMER FOR THE SHOW AND HAD TO CATCH UP, BUT I AM HOOKED NOW!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|How have I not reviewed this game already?  I guess I was too busy obsessively working all the levels.  It looks simple, but as the levels progress, the boards get bigger and more complicated, and your early strategies stop working.  Highly recommended if you like puzzle games.
006441034X|5.0|This book has been on my to read list sence I was a kid there just has been to many books I wanted to read. Then the movei came out and I just had to read it. Loved them both and am looking forward to read many mkre books by this author.  She wrote this way before harry potter. Loved it for the kindle.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I had another Bible app, but got this one because I wanted to store the actual text of the Bible on my device, so it would work when there's no wi-fi.  Works great, and all the reading plans are a plus.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These<br /><br />This series flowed with seamless progression without any feeling of self-concious prodding by the author. I sense in his work a love of the process as well as the product. I look forward to being carried into and through more of his thoughtfully considered creations...
B007C94XG4|5.0|This was a big hit with my 3-year-old, and is sure to please any chipmunks fan.  It's not necessary to see the second movie in the series to appreciate this one.
B004J64QSI|5.0|great & so worth getting for the fan of les mis.  especially the part at the end with the cast reunions. awesome!
1568363931|4.0|This is a beautiful book and was fun to look through.  I have yet to make any recipes (I often buy cookbooks just to read but never make them).  I do wish he included nutrition info, though he mentions a lot of the lunches are around or under 600 calories.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great!  Those who cannot get out of the game need to push the &quot;stuff&quot; button &amp; your bottom bar comes up.  You also don't have to spend real money to play.  I don't.  It is addicting and if you choose to spend your own money you can.  You just have to be patient &amp; you can earn everything you need. The only problem I have is that it is currently closing automatically during play.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book was recommended to my by my favorite yoga instructor. I finished reading it within a week and truly enjoyed it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I enjoy the Jack Reacher books but they are becoming one among many. These types of books are becoming so common that they are slowly becoming boring and predictable. It is almost like watching episodes of a TV series where the good guy falls in love each week and wins the day. Ho hum..
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Higher Call showed that soldering can be more than killing machines.  It was enlightening and entertaining.  Anyone interested in war history will really enjoy reading this book.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This powerful book about a personal experience dealing with Nazis goes well beyond the stories of Corrie Ten Boom or Anne Frank.  It is a book people want to reread several times.  As a matter of fact, our local library cannot keep enough copies of the book because patrons check them out and won't return them!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This book gives the reader a true insight into the world of fame, drugs and rock. Nikki's personal account of what the drug did to his life and how it affected the people around him was gripping. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. I am so glad he got his life together. I have seen this band in concert many times over the years and its great to know that Nikki Sixx triumphed over his heroin addiction. I would call this book a &#34;must read&#34; for any Crue fan.
1451648537|5.0|A fantastic book.  What a fantastically well written story about the modern messiah Steve Jobs.  I was riveted from the first couple of pages.  Walter Isaacson is a terrific writer.  Reading this story makes me love Apple even more.  Don't miss this book.
B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|the movie arrived on time and in good condition. The acting was ok...I wasn't really<br />impressed with girl...I bought the movie for other reasons.
0525953728|5.0|This is a riveting book.  Well written, easy to follow and completely engaging.  If you are a history buff and a military buff like me you will absolutely love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its fun to play and if you love horses then this is a great to play I never get bored of it
B006IYG5HE|5.0|If you don't know about author Jo Nesbo yet, it is time to discover his novels and Harry Hole,his featured character.  This book is another page turner.  After a bit of a slow start, you will be drawn into this story and won't want to put it down until you have finished.  Nesbo is an excellent story teller.  He will keep you guessing about the conclusion of the tale until the last few pages.  This is another great book.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|I really enjoyed this film, enough to purchased it..... ! Yes, a host of gratuitus violence from start to finish here. One of the higher body counts I can recall in a while, yet the setting of this blood-bath all seems quite natural and everyday within the sequence of life that is Mega-City 1. It's a frightful future! So very much better than the Stallone drone that preceded this film!! Judge, jury, executioner? Dredd the day!!
B000W965QW|5.0|I love the movie.  I decided to read the book finally and I have to say that the movie was very faithful to the book, but the book goes into things in much more detail.  Anyhow, its worth a read.  Not going to write a grade school book report.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|AT least half of the book was play by play description of eagles football games - boring! The main character spoke and acted like a child rather than a mentally unstable adult. Weird and poorly written.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|\\"Arrow\\" is dark to be sure, but in such a fun way. The scenes when \\"Arrow\\" is in action are fascinating, balletic. And anything with Paul Blackthorne in it is worth watching -- still wish \\"The Dresden Files\\" had a longer run. Hadn't bothered with this when it started and just happened to be flipping around Amazon instant TV one day and came upon it. Now I'm hooked.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|easy read, predictable but also enjoyable.  Good guys win in the end!  Good feeling when I read the last sentence!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Very different from the movie, which I loved but not funny.  The father is not at all the same character as in the movie.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is a little repetitive, but a great ending!  If you love the first book, you will love them all!  A seductive spin on a fairy tale love story!  Can't wait for the movies to be made!!!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is by far the best I have ever read. With each turn in the plot, you won't be able to put the book down. An extraordinary masterpiece
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book!  Great ending to a great trilogy!  Ana and Christian just steal your heart, would love to hear more of from Christians view point!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is overall a great app because you have 2 things you can do which is survival where you live of the materials you find and survive the zombies at night then in creative you can build whatever you can think of with the blocks you get so this may be $7 but definatly worth it at the stages it is at now plus more to come
B004EPZ02A|3.0|Disappointed that the unrated version is only available on blu ray and I can't afford to buy blu ray players. It's also unfair that some unrated films are only available in that format like Saw VII and Terminator Salvation.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|It was hard to put the book down. So interesting. I loved taking a peek inside such a brilliant, troubled mind.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Though slightly depressing it was a very cute book, which I very much enjoyed. I would recommend it and look forward to reading more by this author.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think we should be allowed to get it on the kindle fire we payed like every on else so why cant we get it
B0000DIXDR|5.0|At the incredible price, everyone should have bought this classic. Plays perfectly and has some great special features. It makes a wonderful addition to any movie collection.
B0036OS3EW|5.0|I used Crocs before, I love it, my boots are very comfy and I like the style, and the color, price was decent.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Got these when we re-painted our daughters room.  They wanted a Princess room very badly and so we painted and trimmed the room and added these.  Over a year later they are still up with no problems.  I had to move a couple when we rearranged some things and had no troubles.  High quality and good sized.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The sequel to The Hunger Games is amazing to say the least. The book never fails to shock and awe and I cannot wait to finish this trilogy because it makes you want to keep reading. It's heartbreaking and promising.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great game, it makes you think, laugh and learn.  My kids like playing it and working through the levels.  My wife and I enjoy the challenge of trying to get all the stars.  Simple yet thoughtul, a wonderul little game with lots to it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is better than temple run 1. It so much cooler and more fun to play. I just cant stop playing it. its to much fun fun fun fun!!!!!!!
B005VPRF0M|5.0|My childs eyes lit up on Christmas morning when he saw this!!! He and his father had a great time assembling it and playing withit !!!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a good clean funny Christmas movie.  Chevy Chase is one of the last good clean fun actors.  This movie will keep you laughing through the whole thing.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Loved this latest installment in the M.I. franchise! I really liked the addition of a little more humor. The balance of humor and white-knuckle suspense creates a great entertainment experience.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was a little upset when I paid the extra to get 2 day shipping on this product, and it was a day late. However, after using this device, i think I can forgive them. This is the BEST mouse I have ever owned. I was blown away by the functionality of the software from programming the hotkeys and DPI right down to changing the color and oscillation speed of the lighted emblem. The software is easy to use and understand and the mouse itself is great. It is aesthetically pleasing as well as functional with the hotkeys and the removable/addable weights included. Great mouse at a great price. Game on.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|really like temple run 2. love that when the power meter fills up you can choose your boost. I would give it 5 stars except it still has some glitches .
B00007KWHN|5.0|Early Yes at its Best. Highly recommended for the Yes fan and those who think they aren't. Prog rock rules
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Kept me hooked the entire book.  Couldn't wait to read, stayed up late and got up early until I was finished.
B004G6TD3O|5.0|The best of ELP, all under one cover. I didn't get to see this show but saw it on TV
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is fun, challenging, and a little bit addicting. It is easy in the beginning levels, but then can be pretty difficult as you move through the levels. Great for the whole family.
140053271X|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, who is in the Army currently. She loves it to death and then some!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game gives me something to do when I am bored. It starts out easy, but it gets harder as you go through the levels. It's like a puzzle and a maze all in one.
B0090EJR1K|4.0|I would strongly recommend movie rental, if you have a good internet connection. i think the movie was kinda funny
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is waayyy better than the first Temple Run game! Everyone in the family loves playing this game - pretty great game.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|My husband and I were riveted. We watched the entire first season in 3 nights! Ordered Showtime just to be able to watch season 2.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is fun and you can earn different swords and backgrounds. The game gets boring after a while though.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|I am absolutely awestruck.  I have now read half the series and cannot wait to see what tools around next, on the weekend!
B0086700CM|3.0|It gives me something to do when I am bored. You have to be a fast thinker and be ready at all times.
B0063IH60K|3.0|it needs to keep track of your scores and times..i like to see how many games i've played, and how quick i played,,,
B006LSZECO|4.0|what a page turner!! Kept me interested from the very start. I would recommend this book to anyone for a quick, thrilling read!!
B0041VV03A|3.0|Was it worth the $2.99? Yeah, I guess so.<br />Would I pay it again?  Not to see it a second time, but I'm glad I saw it once.<br /><br />The creature designs are VERY Patricia Piccanini-esque, which is why I wanted to see it, and I'm interested in explorations of the moral ambiguity of some aspects of genetic research.  But at a point, it just got kind of silly, and there were all these weird vague back stories to the two main characters that &#60;could&#62; have been really interested and interwoven with the main conflict more, but for some reason were left half-baked.  And, of course, the sum moral that &#34;genomic fiddling is bad&#34; sort of irks me in its simplicity, but I wasn't really expecting anything brilliant on that end. I mean, it's a creature feature: as such, it's a good time, watch it!  But it does make me wish somebody would take a stab at the same concept, with the same creatures, but more, err, seriously.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|pretty cool, if you are into Harry Potter stories. I read all books and saw all movies in a theater. Had to have all movies in my home library too. So this and the part II, was the last one I needed it.  Will watch them all again.
B009AMALLM|1.0|Wow.... All I can say is that I am so sad that I used two hours of my life to watch this movie. I LOVE scary movies - all sorts - and I've enjoyed this series. But this latest addition is just plain terrible. It wasn't scary, it wasn't startling, it wasn't interesting. It was just really bad. Wow.... I wish they had stopped at #3.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|watched it second time with my grand kids. We all love the movie and enjoyed it very much. One of the best one.
0062200909|5.0|Well, the movie isn't as magic as the story, but this book will reveal much about how magic becomes reality.  The Weta folks had the experience from LOTR and this proves they know what they're doing.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Part 2 of Fifty Shades of grey.  You'll want to finish all 3 books.  Keeps you interested until the end.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|WHEN YOU SEE THE NAME GOOGLE YOU CAN BET ITS GOING TO WORK FINE...VERY USER FRIENDLY...I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of those books that you don't want to put down.  You'll want to keep reading to see what happens next.  Excellent book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|GONE GIRL loved the fast pace but HATED the ending....left me hanging!  left me feeling book ending eas unfininished, no closure!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book 2 wasn't as good as 1 but still keeps your interest.  All 3 books were worth reading and I recommend it.
B000PATZQK|3.0|Musics great but I thought the CD would have a jewel case or or something other that a perfectly flat sleeve to house the CD.  Not too big of a deal but it won't be easy to find within my CD collection.  Very cheap packaging.
0812984412|3.0|The movie follows fairly close to the book, but is, perhaps, slightly easier to follow due to the actors who play recurring roles. Not a bad book, but I expected it to be a little 'deeper.'
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Realistic and fun to play....my 1yo daughter loves to watch the horse run :) there's plenty to do to keep your horse active and keep the app moving.
B007V65R54|3.0|I like books about randomness, probability and forecasting. I have read this book after reading Taleb's Black Swan and Mlodinow's Drunkard's Walk and Subliminal. Despite dealing with slightly different subject I found this book much less engaging and interesting in comparison. Partially also because I do not follow baseball and I am also not interested in US politics, which this books discusses quite heavily. Additionally I found that topics are discussed in great lengths and with lots of repetitions, padding the books that, in my opinion should have no more than 80 pages.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I could not put the book down and just when I thought I had it figured out, Flynn surprises with wonderful twist and turns. I have to say I expected a little more from the ending but it was mainly because it wasn't as creative as all the other events in the book- and it was a bit unbelievable. The writing itself was superb. You really get a sense of knowing all the characters.<br />Great book!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Love this book! First story in a long time that I was willing to stay up until 3 and 4 in the morning just to keep reading it. It's a total page turner. The ending, however, while tying up all the appropriate loose ends, did disappoint me a bit. It seemed to resolve a bit too quickly, which was a bit anti-climatic. Still a great novel though and a must read.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I follow Tim in his blog and I read pretty much everything he writes. This is an interesting book because is not just a cook book, is not just a book about learning and mastering, is about life. He teaches you how to master any skill and he uses cooking as his canvas, but it could be anything. I got the download version of the book, so there is an interactive option so you can see videos, pictures and other cool things.<br /><br />I recommend this book and I personally like reading it on a kindle or iPad. I see Tim as part mad scientist, bible salesman and visionary.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Thought this movie was sub par at best.  Acting 3rd rate. Story line 3rd rate.  Disappointed I actually spend money on this movie.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I have only seen one episode and it was very interesting. I am planning to view the other episodes in the near future.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Got this series and was kinda nervous at first but now I can not put the books down just finished this one and now on to the next!!!!!!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|A very cute little game, although it can take a long while to advance if you resist the urge to spend real money.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|works great!  Everyonce in awhile it freezes and closes. It also doesn't let you turn with a swap after 4 games played.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This movie was fun and funny, my husband and I thought it was the best one of all the Ice Age movies. I highly recommend for all ages.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|Although watching a mini-series about a WWII U-Boat crew in german is not everybody's idea of fun, this truly is a work of art. Jurgen Prochnow's work is without compare and still remain the benchmark of excellence for storytelling for most WWII and submarine movies.<br /><br />Have no fear, English dubbing and/or subtitles are available (but much better to watch it in German with English subtitles).
B0011ZYBQM|5.0|If you like Pat Metheny, you'll love &#34;We Live Here.&#34;  It is pretty standard Metheny fare, and a frequent choice when I'm at work.
B00364K6YW|4.0|Got this as a Christmas gift for my mom. I am normally not a Pride and Prejudice fan (read it in high school, and did not enjoy), but my mom made be watch it, and Colin Firth delivers a truly masterful performance. I actually enjoyed watching it over again.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Love the plot, the character interaction, and that it's a baseball movie. NOt sure but i just enjoy these past 2 baseball films, moneyball and trouble with the curve. NOt much to say about other than it's touching, story-filled, and very entertaining. Can't really think of anything bad to say about it . So enjoy!<br /><br />~shauns movie review
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Once again AMC delivers with Mad Men S5. I have always been a fan of Mad Men, but now on Blu-ray, it is taken to a whole other level. Definitely made for some great holiday viewing: got through the whole season in a about a day and a half. Super fast delivery, so definitely a must-buy for any Mad Men fan.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I really did enjoy the remake of this dredd. FIrst of all because the way they made it and finished the movie means they can make all the sequels they want. Second of all because I simplly love \\"judge Anderson\\" Olivia Thirlby. She's so cute. I love that they put an empasis on the gun. It's so cool. THey kept it short and sweet. Left his helmet on the whole time too which i though was actually funny.<br /> *Correction* Oops dredd was written first. I do have to point out that anyone who has seen the raid-redemption knows that its basically identical with dredd having its own finishing touches on it. Second time I have seen this in past few years. The first one was with hunger games copycatting \\"battle royal\\". I don't have a problem with it though because i love all the movies. I also like the amercian remakes also such as \\"the girl with the dragon tatoo. \\"<br />  In conclusion this film was just kick ace. Lots of action and they keep the movie going fast-paced. I look forward to a sequel if they make one!<br /><br />*6/9/2014 Watched it again tonight. I'd have to agree with my former posts stating it rocked. Olivia thirlsby is simply dreamy, and the action sequences are entertaining. I'm happy with the finished products. I think the film did a great job of leaving the viewer wanting more as it should have been it's primpary goal. However I've read they may not do any more sequels which leaves me very disappointed for I thought the goal was to make a bunch of these. Oh well I hope they change their minds, but it seems like the movie industry is only interested in movies like marvel that only make hundreds of millions instead of only a few million. Thanks 4 reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's awesome I love it very much and t B-) e best science my time if u know what I'm saying NO BTW
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this is much more addictive and fun than the first one I am so glad that they made this and it makes me want to play it all the time
B0002TJGQS|4.0|I would definately order these again.  They arrived a little later than the due date but only by a couple of days.  The batteries I have used so far seem to be fine so...so far so good!! And good value for money!..thank you
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Great start. I can't  wait to read the rest of the series and find out the purpose of these experiments.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Excellent and leaves you yearning for more.  Worried that I will have to wait years to read the next book. A little Closure might have been nice.  Good thing he has the mini series so I can review when he finally gets to the next one.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Even if you don't like Mark Wahlberg or Mila Kunis, give this movie a go. It's hilarious, different than anything out there right now, a completely new concept. Which, let's be honest, is becoming harder and harder to find. Good, not so clean, fun, definitely not a family friendly movie, but hey, sometimes that's what we're looking for, right?! So if you are on the cusp of making a decision on this movie, I would definitely recommend it if your looking for a laugh, there are some AWESOME one liners and fantasy/weird camera shots.<br />Here's a little sneak preview:<br />\\"STAND UP STRAIGHT WHEN YOUR TALKING TO ME\\"-Says a maybe 9 year old boy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is an excellent series. Well written, superbly acted, wonderfully produced and amazingly filmed! I love this series. I look forward to more.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and thought it offered an interesting perspective.  The narrator is Enzo, a mixed breed dog who tells the story of his owner and their life together.  It was fascinating to read about things that were happening from the dog's perspective since you never really knew the entire story since Enzo didn't know everything.  I did find the actual racing discussions to be a bit boring and often found myself skimming through them but I'm not a fan of sports racing.<br /><br />It was a great story, easy to read, and you if you love dogs this is a great book for you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the Walkind Dead, I think they are doing an amazing job on portraying a Zombie Apocolypse. Stories are great... its not always &#34;A perfect ending for all&#34; which I like.
072325804X|5.0|This complete book is excellent for reading to a child at bedtime, and will provide a treasure for a lifetime.
B000WLIQP8|5.0|Like I said in the title, it's good. I enjoyed it, and it was nice, unobtrusive music for our organization's community dinner.
B006YB9VJU|5.0|My wife is currently using them everywhere, she already has them ready for several different activities, only downside is that GPS toggle does not come up in the list of actions, but I believe that's a problem with her XperiaS, not with the tags.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I wasn't sure about this movie and probably never would have purchased if I hadn't seen the previews on a different movie I was watching.  Haven't watched this one yet, but I can't wait.  I have heard good things about this movie.
B004AKCME8|5.0|The animation is excellent as well as the story line.  I would recommend this film to ant and all ages.
B009329Y30|5.0|We love this movie.  Couldn't wait for it to arrive.  Had to watch it the night we received it.  My husband even enjoyed it.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|This is an interesting twist on the original tale.  I enjoyed it very much.  We need more of this type.
B004XVMCMQ|1.0|Rarely do I completely and wholeheartedly loathe an Austen adaptation. The Bollywood version Bride and Prejudice was delightful. The Kiera Knightley P&P was ghastly, but mainly because the producers thought that a gentleman in 19th century Britain lived with chickens in his manor house. Shudder!<br /><br />But this was so completely horrible that I can't encourage anyone to watch it under any circumstances. It has NOTHING whatever to do with the Austen novel. Someone bought the title and then created an anti-slavery shock-and-rock period piece.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I read it in two evenings.  couldn't put it down. I look forward to seeing where the next one takes them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not sure what else to say.  Colleen Hoover did an excellent job writing these characters.  VERY hard book to put down.  She makes you happy, sad and hold your breath multiple times while reading this book.  I heard someone call it depressing but I totally disagree.  Every book has it's sad points and this one does to but to say it was depressing is totally wrong.....and the ending....OMG what a GREAT way to end the book.  I think you will truly fall in love with this book.  This is one I could read again and again.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I never got to see or get this but wanted to see it....very interested in why it is there when I don&#34;t have it But, But I imagine it is great
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the first book by Sylvia Day and I think Reflected in You was even better.  I'm excited for the third book to come out and find out what is happening in the next book.  I think her books do fall along the same line as 50 Shades but I think they might be better.  I don't suggest reading them close together (Crossfire & 50).  Give yourself time between them if reading both.
0740797719|5.0|A very well written book that covers all aspects of creating your own masterpiece.<br />Lots of great tips! I recommend this book to all artists
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|I really like this cd. The electronica direction is new for T & S but I think they pull it off well and over all i think its a very solid album, especially the first half<br /><br />Its basically a break up cd, all about how \\"the girl\\" doesn't appreciate T & S, left her, wasn't true, whatever. Which is fine but my main problem, if it is one, with Heartthrob is that after about 6 songs or so it just sounds like they're repeating themselves a little. It might have worked better if they'd had a song or two about something else in there<br /><br />Anyway other than that I loved it and I look forward to their next one
0740785508|5.0|A very well written book that covers all aspects of creating your own masterpiece.<br />Lots of great tips!  I recommend this book to all artists.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It force closes itself a lot. I can only play it once, and that's right after I download it again. After I play it once, it won't open again. Therefore, 2 stars! -Kindle Fire
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My wife and I love this show! There are some people around AMC that deserve a raise. All of the actors that have been interviewed on the GEEKTIME radio program on SiriusXM were awesome to listen to. We can't wait for more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its awesome this is the best the first one was good too.both of them are great thx everyday thank you so much it is great app
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Some of the sounds have short enough loops that you cant help but notice while you listen. But otherwise not a bad white noise app.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Fun ties to significant historical events, Native American legends and geological history of our region and potential future events.  All tied together in an intriguing mystery.  A fun, fast paced read.
B00957T6X6|3.0|My only complaint is that these books come as one single huge file, rather than as five separate ones.  It makes searching and organizing more difficult than it needs to be, and when I eventually purchase the as-yet-unwritten sequels, it will look like I have three books by GRRM rather than seven.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it!  It was suspenseful, yet family oriented with a twist at the end.  You will not be disappointed!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Why glow stone if no nether<br />Butt really good get it hurry<br />You might miss the next<br />Update ha ha
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Bought the album because the three singles are excellent. Turns out the rest of the album doesnt quite live up to what i expected. It isnt bad, its just that the singles set the bar really high.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.  I get started and don't want to put it down.  would like to enter act more with horse-clean his feet - comb - mane &amp; tail.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Comparable to the 50 shades, I feel it has a better story line, very quick read. Can't wait for the next book
B002LII6KA|5.0|Great price for a great collection of movies! I'm not a superfan but I love the Matrix franchise and was very happy about this purchase. I don't even think Walmart could sell it at this price. ;)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Its a good game to play! I recommend this game....the only thing is u have to use real money..but I like it a lot I play it all the time and my kids like it also
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As with every Sparks book, this one was fantastic as well. Loved it! Can't wait for the next one. Thanks
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Abercrombie continues his saga of Nine-Fingers and Bayaz only now it is a generation later and our main character is Shy and the setting  is the gold rush in the old West. Expect the same bloody, well written fight scenes and the same great writting from one of the best new authors of thrilling sagas. Abercrombie never disappoints and we look forward to more and more. Red Country is great on its own, but one might find reading The Law Trilogy Box set, then the following books, more enjoyable, whichever one chooses there is no going wrong with a Joe Abercrombie book!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book!! It was very easy to read but also well written. I liked the characters and the different personalities.. Would read it again !
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Very fun! Love the Mineral level. A few small dislikes, but not enough to stop me from playing. Good for any age.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is literally the best book I have ever read. It's powerful. I wish it could've been longer. It really made me think
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it fun and challenging and it has challenges for you to do. like collect 750 coins and run 2000 meters
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a really cute game, and is very time waste full. Its a nice way to show your kids how to take care of an animal.
B002QW7AJY|5.0|A friend of mine mentioned this and said they liked it.<br /><br />I got the blu-ray and to my surprise, it is a pretty darn good movie. I have watched it more than once :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I played Solitaire with cards for years, off and on. Played it on a computer for the first time in the late 90s and loved it, but haven't played either at for quite awhile.<br />So glad that something made me download this app. It's addictive and a big improvement over that 90s version I played.
B007ZZKWHY|5.0|This movie is funny as heck.<br /><br />It is not politically correct, so if you are a &#34;Church Lady&#34; it is not for you. The US is the butt of many of the jokes, so be sure you can laugh at yourself.<br /><br />If you like Volkswagens, there are a couple of cameos.<br /><br />I expect Iron Sky will take its place beside Rocky Horror at the midnight movies !
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Entertaining and mildly thought-provoking.<br />Looking forward now to a more serious telling of the story in Bill O'Reilly's Killing Kennedy.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|What do I say? Its a Free Angry Birds! How awesome is that? There is the advertizing, but it's FREE!
B0091XIZO0|1.0|I bought this disc specifically for Tristesse.....total disappointment when I found it had a very bad female vocal covering the piano.
B008RJFRTK|5.0|Update: as of 2013, the Amazon AppStore is very unreliable in extended offline scenarios. I would HIGHLY recommend you purchase this from Google's Play store instead. I have been traveling overseas for 6 months, and have had zero issues with apps from Google Play, but frequently get errors in Amazon apps like \\"you must be connected to the internet to use this app\\" or \\"Unknown appstore error; please reinstall this app.\\"  Not just for this app--for ALL purchased Amazon apps.    In addition, the app is more frequently updated in the Google Play store. I just purchased it there, and it has more features, and much smoother map scrolling than the one I just uninstalled from Amazon's app store. Both are the Pro version.  More info on the offline issue here:  [...]  Original review:  This is one of the most useful apps we've taken with us on our one year, round-the-world trip.  Network access is definitely not a guarantee, but with the offline maps, it doesn't matter where you are.  We used the free version of this for a while, and finally invested in the pro version.  The search capability is really worth the price--fantastic.  It's not just search, it also lists businesses, points of interest, etc., which is a lifesaver in a strange new city, when you have just landed, and don't have wifi yet.  And it quickly pays for itself when you no longer have to buy detailed local maps for each place you visit--and in many of the places where we needed maps, no paper maps were available for purchase anyway.  This is a must have for wold travelers.
B002VWNICW|5.0|Great movie, the shipper sent it fast, and it wasn't damaged at all.<br /><br />This is supposed to be a &#34;chick flick&#34;, even though I can understand why, I see this movie as more of an example of what<br />our present era should be like.  Men being gentlemen, ladies being taken care of, and family/friendship being considered<br />with highest regard.  Once I have some boys of my own, I will show them this movie for a perfect depiction of what<br />a gentleman should look like.  Don't get me wrong, I by no means am some wussy guy who hides under pressure, hates confrontation or doesn't stand up for things.  I'm quite the opposite, my wife can back me on that haha  My point is, is that this generation (at least in my area) has very few gentlemen left, that are selfless, caring, and strong.  I believe when a woman is willing to be apart of any guys life, that that guy should do everything in his power to make her happy.  And what's amazing is that, the woman is so happy that she makes the man happy without even thinking about it! Anyways... haha<br /><br />Good movie, I recommend it, and a good seller
1250027624|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for a friend, and she tells me how much she loves it every time I see her.  I have looked through the book, too, and it's very nice.  My friend is a big Downton Abbey fan, and she would know a quality book!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very good. It shows you many things about horses, but it is fun at the same time. It has very interesting clothes for the riders and tack for the horses. Im sure you will enjoy this game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game! I have played this for hours .  It is very addictive. I love that you can run and run and the trail is always a little different.  I am not that great at it but it is very fun anyway.  The game runs very well on my Sony S tablet.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Excellent read Wilde s description is beautifully crafted. The plot keeps you motivated to read more. The issues are numerous and thought provoking.
1609611543|5.0|this actually is a duplicate of the Wheat belly book by Davis.  I felt cheated.  wish people would not try to take credit and embellish other peoples work.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|love it, only a few epsisodes in, but so far, better than season 1.  love it.  love it.  love it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Why is this required?  I already gave it five stars.  Isn't that obvious?  Seven more words are required, so here is nine.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|This game doesn't even work!every time I tap this game it just keeps freezing. I don't recommend it. this game is a piece of garbage.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The way she weaves the story between time and places. She is a master at developing the characters and keeping it interesting. Marvelous content and story telling, I am hooked and am on to the next Kate Morton!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is my absolute favorite app. All time best music application out there. No complaints whatsoever. Definitely worth having on any device.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This book pulls you in from the first page with intrigue, twists and turns. She is so wonderful at weaving a story between different times and places giving you just enough to force you to not turn out the light at 1am but keep reading. I have currently read 3 of her books and all are outstanding.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my kids really enjoyed this app especailly my oldest daughter. my husband likes it too<br />. it is simple yet challenging enough to keep you interested
B00884GR0W|5.0|Great time killer game. I've never played minecraft and now I guess I never have a need to. Aprox. Coords would be helpful for trying to complete quests. one last suggestion, I hate losing mana while flying id rather a jet pack that works like the torch.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a hard book to put down.  The story was believable, suspenseful and interesting.  The characters were likeable and easy to get attached to.  You don't need to be a science/space expert or fan to enjoy this.  Most enjoyable and engaging book I've read in a long time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome show. Keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat. Zombies rule and make the show the hit that it is.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|This movie exceeded my expectations. I Loved it, so much that after watching it on Netflix, I bought the Blu-Ray. Warrior is not just about a MMA fighter, but about family, dedication, trust, and coming to terms with your past. It's about doing what you know in your heart to be right, regardless of what your mind may tell you.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I have not read a Grisham book in years and I was looking for &#34;beach reading&#34;....While I admit I finished it, hardly worth spending any more time even writing about it.  The author's closing words say it all.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Well developed characters, but unsympathetic. Rowling's indepth physological insights create a town peopled with self-centered, unlikeable characters. While the plot was almost lost in the character description,  I didn't like any of them enough to really care what happened to them.
B00457X7XQ|3.0|I would prefer to rate it \\"2.5\\" Two stars is too harsh, and three too generous, but there you are.<br /><br />Mark Russinovich is one of the most technically brilliant people I have had the opportunity to meet, but as a fiction author he doesn't really meet the mark.  The story telling technique is very similar to the earlier Tom Clancy novels, where the author creates a lot of threads and you keep wondering how it's all going to come together in the end.  With early Clancy, this was usually done in a satisfying manner, but Zero Day feels like \\"OK, that's enough pages, wrap it up now\\".<br /><br />The premise is good, quite credible and detailed.  However the attention to detail on the female characters in the book borders on schoolboy mentality.<br /><br />But worst of all is the editing.  The book is littered with grammatical errors, especially plurals where singular form is required as well as evidence that whoever edited the book had no understanding of the material.  \\"DWT\\" stood for Dead Weight Tons (or Tonnes) last time I checked, not \\"Tongues\\", and can we just agree whether it's \\"script kiddies\\" or \\"kitties\\", because both terms get used.<br /><br />Yes, I realise I am being a pedant but these things to matter to me.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|It's Led Zeppelin, period. The band is in fine form, especially for a one-off performance. Jason Bonham does a respectable job filling in for his dad. The video production and sound are good.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This movie stunk! I know there is a cute bear on the cover but this is not a kids movie. There is not a rating on it so that is a little deceptive. This movie is full of childish humor that is not appropriate for children.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Zombie Apocalypse like you have never seen, Who will be the next to be eaten by hording zombies? Great story and the acting is excellent. You will be sucked in in 5-minutes.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son  love this game add for his tablet  very easy to play and you can have a lot fun
B007X15GRQ|1.0|I'm a big fan, but this is Mark Wahlberg's worst movie that I've seen.<br /><br />The foul language is just absolutely unnecessary.  I think they were getting paid by how many “f” bombs they could utter per scene.  And the plot was a little thin too.  Just hated it, no redeeming points I can make about it
B00333NCTM|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it. This is the first book I've read from cover to cover in many years. It's hilarious, sad, frustrating, and shows a side to Ozzy that I didn't know existed.
B001G8XON0|5.0|not a big musical fan but for some reason this movie i loved!!!! figured i would check it out in blu-ray!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I rooted my phone to get rid of all the bloat ware so this program really come in handy for me.
B004DHUAZQ|5.0|This movie has great action and fun to watch. Its great to see my action heroes all on one screen.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really do love this game. its really easy to use. its also a lot of fun. you cant really go wrong with buying this app. its free any way.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I think 10,000 Days is a victim of Tool's previous album's. My personal opinion is that if you laid this album down next to four other randomly selected CD's it would almost always be the best of the group. It is a five star work.<br /><br />Tool doesn't need my help to sell albums, so I will briefly include an observation that stuck in my mind after I finished listening to this album for the first time. When you listen to Black Sabbbath at the very height of their career, you hear four instruments perfectly placed, respecting each other (the fourth is Dio's voice)giving each other space and spot light. Sign of the Southern Cross is perhaps the perfect example of what I mean. Tool has this same respect among its band members as well, and that is clear from Sober all the way to the present. Attention. Intension.<br /><br />Enjoy the layering and excellence.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Why did nobody tell me about this book?! I mean I've heard of it, but someone should have grabbed me and said, \\"This book is awesome, you must read it!\\" When I initially heard about this book I wasn't at all interested. I heard Paris and checked out the blurb, but the blurb didn't intrigue me. It actually sounded kinda boring and a little juvenile for my taste.<br />Then they had this one day sale where it was $2.99 on Kindle, and one of my favorite authors recommended it. I bought it, not even sure I'd read it, thinking I might even try to return it. And I sat down to give it a try. I'm also not one to read a book just for the \\"hot guy\\" love interest. I need my books to have more substance than just, girl falls all over herself for some guy bc he's cute and has an accent. I was afraid this was that type of book, but I'm happy to say I was wrong. Once I started reading I could not put this book down! I have to say the name Étienne St. Clair made me pause the first time I read it. I kinda thought I might be annoyed by this guy and his pretentious, ridiculous name. And now, through Perkins' writing magic, I actually adore that name. He goes mostly by St. Clair, and there's a significance to that, but I think it also helps ease you into his whole name gradually. It's easier to use his real name once you really 'get to know' him. I was up until 2:30am needing to know what would happen and also just thoroughly enjoying the whole experience. I haven't stopped thinking about these characters for 2 days. Stephanie Perkins just knows how to write an all around incredible novel. I adore Anna and Étienne! Basically everything about them. I didn't want their story to end because I just want to spend more time with them. They're relatable and real and fun and flawed. And Paris! Hello!! This book makes you feel like you're actually right in the middle of it. It's witty and just super fun. I think I laughed out loud at least every other page through the entire first half of thebook. Even when the plot got a little more serious, there were still some light hearted moments throughout. The serious parts were awesome too, because obviously the whole book was awesome. :) But it took the story to another level. When I started the book I fell in love with the characters (not just Anna and Étienne) and was having a blast in a whimsical, romantic comedy type way, but I'm also glad the plot dug a little deeper. Don't get me wrong, fluff is great sometimes, but I usually like my books to have a little substance to them too, something to take away. So basically this is an all around great novel. I think I will definitely be reading it again sometime. But I was super excited to discover that Stephanie has another book out, Lola and the Boy Next Door, and Anna and Étienne have a cameo. So I need to go read that. Like now. :)
B0059XTUB8|5.0|I was excited to get this disc and have it be in perfect condition.  I'm a collector of DVD's and this is a great addition to my collection.
B008VBYN80|2.0|Game is good, but can't connect. So it it pretty useless. Diamonds are too expensive. No &quot;deals&quot; on kindle or &quot;free&quot; diamonds.
B003L77GGA|5.0|Good very good<br />Love it<br />Came fast<br />************<br />Good good good good good good good good good good good good good good goodgood
B000UBMSB8|5.0|box is great. the 4 cds comes in a small package but of good quality.<br />the extras has some value. the documentary is great and the production analysis too. ridley scotts presentation for each movie is completely useless never being more than oh this has one scene more and well is not my favorite version.<br />only thing missing (or i skipped by chance???) is some comments about the vangelis soundtrack...
140053271X|2.0|After waiting two weeks, I received my nook.  I purposely bought the earlier, stripped-down model, since hearing (and reading) about all the manufacturers and design flaws occurring in the backlit versions.  I also ordered many doodads- a cover, screen saver, clip-on light, etc.  Everything was there.  I was so close to reading!  But NO.  When you buy a Nook, you cannot assume to use it unless someone has told you ahead of time that the purchase, unlike any other electronic device, does not include a charger.  This is extra.  I wasted money on a clip-on light and I don't have a charger??  So there it sits.  It's been there for a month.  I'm so irritated I can't bring myself to go get a charger.<br /><br />So Nook shoppers, prepare yourselves.  It's not like everything else.  B&N will be nickel and diming you to death for the stuff you NEED.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Despite becoming a pop culture Icon...this game goes down as one of the all time greets like Pac Man or Mario. Brothers. it holds up and continues to feel fresh no matter how many times you play. And who doesn't. try to get three stars on every level?
B00003CXA3|5.0|I have always considered The French Connection to be the best &#34;cop&#34; movie ever made. This particular release is first rate. Great color and image quality, in fact I read that some people prefer this over the more expensive Blue Ray version. I highly recommend this version to anyone that wants to own this great film.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|I gave this 5 stars, it is detailed, valuable information on all aspects of investing and the markets.  I find it very helpful.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The posts in the group's don't load. Only the first 12 show up and that's all. The rest are in blue.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My mother and brother both began reading this book at the same time. Feeling left out and having the desire to join in, I purchased this on my Kindle.<br /><br />This book is one of those reads that is hard to put down. Listening to the story of Katniss, her hardships, her relationships with family and friends, and her time dealing with the Games and the Capitol makes you 'hunger' for more.<br /><br />I could read this over and over. I recommend this book to anyone contemplating on reading it!
B005USZML4|5.0|Another AMAZING story by my favorite writer, John Grisham.  It has all the suspense and drama of his other books, minus some of the violence.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the show! I am a huge fan of the series.  And I appreciate how easy it was to order the  episode!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The first chapter of this book offered revolutionary ideas about changing habits. I highly recommend this books for anyone looking to build new life skills or improve on old ones.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great book with so many twists and suprizes. Loved every page, can't wait for the next one. Well done book
B000WC3A0S|5.0|I love the product it was what it said it was and i have to write  18 words total done
B0052RDHTM|5.0|It was riveting to witness history through the eyes of characters directly involved and impacted by the events of the time.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Clarke is officially my favorite sci-fi author.  He makes me feel like a slug.  A slug with aspirations!!!!  If you like being put in your place, you'll love Childhood's End.  Also, check out Rendezvous with Rama.  You'll feel like an unnoticed slug that a gardener flicks away with his spade while planting new bulbs.  We're not worthy!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This is the first headphone of its type that I've owned. Prior to this, I'd bought into the Bose marketing and sprung for the over the ear designs. Suffice it to say that this headphone was a revelation in the folly of buying into marketing hype. Compared side to side, the sound is more balanced, rich, and complete. Compared to my Shure IEMs, the sound is more neutral (Shure it turns out lean more towards the bassy side). It is comfortable to wear for extended periods of time although I imagine that in the summer, it might tend towards the hot side. I will update this review should any issues arise.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this particular game on my ipod and now enjoy it on my Kindle Fire 7.  Easy and fun to use.
B0070DOHQS|3.0|rdp worked, but as expected was difficult to maneuver around the remote desktop.  icons on the remote desktop were always rearranged after using this.
B009SJ46EA|3.0|I think the actors were all that really saved the second season. Most of them did an excellent job. Sadly, the story was a little cliched. I loved the first season. It was unexpected, the house was gorgeous and the home had a fascinating history through so many decades. This season was like the writers tried too hard to push too much into a small package. It was about the hospital, then it was about demons, then it was about aliens, then it was about the dead coming back via alien technology. Or was it about the woes of an intolerant society, the need to be open or the perceived hate exhibited by religion? It felt like the writers had no more focus than the audience could maintain.<br /><br />I also hope each season won't hinge so much on the same elements (serial killers, pregnancy, twisted doctors, fetishes, gratuitous sex, people with deformities as plot fodder). Most of those are commonly found in any of the cliched horror movies that are being churned out by the dozens.<br /><br />The first season really kept you guessing as to what was and was not actually supernatural. That was missing in this season. Considering horror audiences aren't actually limited to any demographic, the writers should go back to offering something for a variety of viewers. A little less time on the soap box and a little more concentration on creativity would have made this a great season, too.
B004JK61K0|3.0|this app worked fine with my exchange mail, until the exchange server was updated to a newer (2011) version of exchange
B004SIIBGU|5.0|So easy to use!! and the bidding/selling/watching chime reminders are terrific for my busy life!! Ive been able to save and make money from my cell and kindle fire!! I have the app on both!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game (temple run 2) kinda sucks. It freezes a lot, and sometimes when its loading it will quit and ho to the home page. Over all this game is kinda cool, but still needs work. ; )
B009G78EE2|5.0|I am amazed at this man Macklemore. He makes great catchy I'm not thinking too much about it' songs like Thrift Shop but every song on this album has a great message. He makes good music and delivers it with GREAT unique beats, honesty, and good messages.<br /><br />I buy music all the time and I have NEVER written a review  before but this album is that good; great job Macklemore and Ryan Lewis on an amazing job.
B009X00E18|5.0|I really love my cover, the case is more versatile than advertised.<br /><br />The case is easy to use and stays clean.
B009VB97EY|3.0|It was good that the dancers were portrayed as normal people with normal lives. But the main thing that kept me watching were those beautiful male bodies.
0316017930|3.0|This book is part of a body of information on how to be more successful.  It got repetitive to me.
B00B1MHA18|5.0|Goosebumps and tapping toes led directly to windows down, beating on the steering wheel, stomping my feet. This album, while an instant classic and maybe the best money I ever spent, is not good for my driving abilities.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a great read I love how the story was so great I could not put it done. I love story's that make u feel the emotions of the characters.
B00005AXKF|1.0|I may have missed that this was being shipped from Germany.  Unfortunately it was a last minute Christmas gift and upon arrival it will not play.  It says it is unauthorized to be played in this area.  Needless to say I was very disappointed that my 40 dollars had gone to waste.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Still better than most, but this book was just all plot. I felt no real connection to the story. I felt Grisham's political beliefs were in there a bit and not well hidden by character or story. It comes together with a satisfying and logical ending. I wasn't disappointed, but I certainly wasn't impressed as I have been by Grisham in the past. When finished I shrugged my shoulders and said, &#34;well, that's done.&#34;
030758836X|5.0|This book had me in its web from chapter 1.  I'm not a fan of mysteries, but since it was on our book club list, I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did.  I know many won't like the ending, that it didn't provide enough \\"closure\\" for some, but that's what I liked about it . . . it seemed more real to me.  The fact is that so many authors tie up the story with a pretty ribbon, but life doesn't always lend itself to such solid closure.  I respect the author for not assuming that we readers need tidy endings.  Thank you, Gillian!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a marvelous series - even my husband is enjoying it with me.  The characters are so real and show what the aristocracy and its help really were and probably still are.  I have really enjoyed this.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its ok but the stud in the store costs jewels which you rarely get and getting them on your own costs money.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|This 959 page tome spends approximately the first four chapters just defining the life and philosophy of the bishop who rescues the soul of Jean Valjean, the main character. I'd read this book umpteen years ago as required in a course at school, and didn't mind it back then, before life sped up and we learned how to communicate in 120 characters on Twitter.<br /><br />I downloaded this on Kindle after having seen the movie, starring Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe and many other fine actors. The movie cuts right to the chase, where Jean Valjean is released from jail and spurned from society before meeting that bishop. The movie captures all of the important plot points in Hugo's work, with no drag time. It's a credit to modern screenplay writing, editing, and directing.<br /><br />It was interesting to have the book for comparison. One has to wonder if Victor Hugo would ever have gotten published in today's literature industry, despite the way his novel eventually turns into a compassionate tale of a terrible time in French history.
8186336141|4.0|This has the depth and style of other books from the Bihar School, it is popular, fairly easy to find on display at studios that carry yoga books, very reasonably priced, and the figures and fonts are clear.<br /><br />Satyananda Saraswati is traditional in practice and beliefs relative to most \\"modern yoga\\" or \\"postural yoga\\" books, but he consistently presents in a matter-of-fact and experimental -- rather than a mystical or dogmatic -- way, making it very accessible for a westerner -- even though he is describing traditional hatha yoga, which has a lot of esoteric practices.<br /><br />However, pose and technique catalogs are more valuable as references or as accompaniments to a course, and this book leans more toward the catalog format than the course format.<br /><br />So, if you know you like where the Bihar School is coming from, instead, pay two or three times as much for their hard-cover titled \\"A Systematic Course in the Ancient Tantric Techniques of Yoga and Kriya,\\" and you'll get quite a bit more of the school's material, and totally differently organized such that it is more suitable to work through sequentially. On the other hand, the hardcover book is often terser when it is covering the same material. Other volumes from the school expand in other directions, while also re-using a lot of material -- for example, the \\"Kundalini Tantra\\" book was an eye opener, that I can't even begin to claim to understand or have personally experienced much of.<br /><br />Sometimes my jaw drops when I read the Bihar school's stuff, and I feel blessed that the school has so kindly and widely shared their extensive knowledge in a plain-spoken way. Either \\"Asana Pranayama Murdra Bandha\\" or  \\"A Systematic Course ...\\" would be a very good place to find out whether their teaching suits you.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My family loves board games. Currently, Settlers of Catan is our go-to whenever we can get together. It costs more than many other games, but has a wide variety of expansions available, so it never gets boring.<br /><br />The one drawback with this basic box which must be purchased before getting expansion packs is that it allows a maximum of 4 players. Adding the Settlers of Catan Expansion box lets you pump that up to six. It's understandable not to allow more players than this, as the territory on the board can only be divided up so much.<br /><br />A bonus consideration is that the expansion packs provide great gift ideas for upcoming birthdays, etc. And they expand one's concepts of developing settlements by bringing in thieves, traders, barbarians, fishing, etc. Unlike RISK, where the single motive is just to kill everyone and take over the planet, Settlers of Catan is a &#34;takeover&#34; game that courts many other pathways than warfare.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Simply put...Amazing. cannot wait to read the next two. Erotic, hit, can't put it down type of reading. Loved it!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I really enjoyed this series when it was televised on ABC and I was very disappointed when the series ended.  I purchased the DVDs since I would like to watch the series again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this book much at first because the characters are so young and it was reminding me of Diary of a Whimpy Kid. I was wrong. It was great! Be forewarned it deals with a subject that could be difficult for someone who went through a similar experience as a child.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This was an outstanding series that was cancelled way too soon.  While  some of the acting was not the best, the main characters were outstanding.  Highly recommend the series.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My sons love this game, it is addictive and challenging.  They would recommend it to everyone, one of the few they have played that they have told their friends about.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a great game! only had one problem but I just reinstalled it. otherwise it is a fun game and is highly recommended by me
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this is the best game I have ever played and the mine in this game is awesome.You should really get this game or I will explode in tee minus 10 seconds 10;9;8;7 thecl clock is ticking better get the game NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|As older person, rarely use, but love it when I catch up with grandkids. Don't like it that more words are required for reviews here.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I think that if they are going to make a book for kindle fire, the interactive book reader, you should be able to interact with the book. In this dictionary, there should be pictures and be able to touch the word and it would show the picture, you are better off reading the paper old fashion book.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I bought the first 4 seasons of Fringe for myself as a Christmas present this year, and I have been enjoying watching these programs again.  The first season sets the stage for the rest of the seasons, so it's a must to buy to understand the back-story & why the story develops the way it does.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I think this dictionary is better off being deleted from the kindle fire book world. If I am looking up a word I should be able to see picture of the word is a noun.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book was absolutely GREAT.  The characters are endearing, the topic was exciting and the transition to each land was made alive by the author.  Nothing to say but if you like to read then this is a must.  HBO has this series on and I am planning to watch after every book is read.  Love, hate, conflict, desire, dragons, demons, ghost, wealthy, poor, knowledgeable, dumb.  Every word that one can think of to describe a well rounded book and characters is in this series.  MUST READ!!!!!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Very good book! I couldn't stop turning the pages. Can't wait for the sequel...I'm totally hanging until the  next book
B00AAQ7LP6|4.0|the sound could be better, but not bad given that there are not enough live performances of R available. Track list is good.
B007SGM084|5.0|It wasn't just about sex which is what I was previously told. It had a story and depth. I would read more of his books.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Its a great story and fantastic book!  The movies of books are not usually as good as the book, but this is very close!
B00992CF6W|5.0|the only problem i have with the app is the update has not came out yet, but i hope it will come out soon. but other than that it is the best app ever.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a glorified soap opera !!  Lots and lots of plot twists and turns ... some you can foresee, some you can't.  Lot of fun ... especially Maggie Smith.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a great game! The picture is amazing. It is so cool how they added the rope feature and the little train cart!
B0010YSD7M|2.0|I am a sci fi fan but for some reason this video just did not hold my interest. I could not get involved with the characters or plot.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This product needs to have a warning associated with it.  it is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!  LOVE IT!  iT'S GREAT ON A TRIP.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game also made a huge comeback. It also opened a hug  new space for innivation and improvement new ideas have been spread to app making companies world wide. Everyone knows what this game is and it so great its almost going to be impossible to make something close to equivalent of this.
B00A196RVG|5.0|Everything is good about the music and video content on this collection.  But nowhere in Amazon's description does it say PAL format.  They ripped me off again.  Either they leave an important detail off the description like the DVD won't play on most US players, or they include a description of a similar item and let you know in small text at the end of the item description.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This series is the best; family friendly and touching!  The complete series comes with both of the made for TV movies.  The first movie is awful, don't ever watch it--it will lower your respect for the characters :)  The second movie is great, watch that one instead!
B00005JLIU|5.0|I used this video to study for a role for which I had an audition. My grandchildren enjoyed watching it with me.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|loved the twist and turns&hellip; had a lot of puzzles and some were a little tricky. the ending was just ok but other then that the game was entertaining
0316227706|5.0|incredible photography - seth has a real gift - what a great way to earn a living - no one looks at this book without a perpetual smile on their face - we gave five of them as Christmas gifts - even our five dogs loved it
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Absolutely fantastic story. Easy to load to my device. Definately worth the read. I got it to refresh myself on the characters before seeing the film and since it had been over 20 years since I first read it I was glad I did.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|That really is the question in this dark world, isn't it?  Now wonder our churches, our country are in such a state of chaos.  Where are the Godly men?
B00AY5B9QA|4.0|Yes, it's a little corny, and it's a holiday movie, but they tied in so many A-List actors very well, and made an incredible movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I first started playing, I didn't like it because all of the graphics are distracting. But then I started loving it! I am so addicted, I have played over 100 times!
B00932ANQM|3.0|I would say this movie is ok. I wasn't too impress  though as I expect more on this movie. It was a bit boring...
B00992CF6W|5.0|The pocket edition of Minecraft is pretty awesome, who wouldn't want to play Minecraft where ever they went? Although it isn't exactly like the PC version, it is still really fun for those who don't mind the smaller amount of items. The controls are also pretty easy... they just need to add a sprint button. One ting that I would like to see changed though is the lack of nameplate's and that you could change the skin you have.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I liked the first season... alot.  DieHard fans of the Green Arrow will have some problems with the backstory and main characters the show is really worthwatching
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I ordered the red case but received the tan. At first I was very disappointed but I quickly fell in love with it. The Kindle Fire fits very snugly under the corner straps. It makes the Kindle feel very safe. It is well made and I'm sure it will be durable.  I highly recommend this product.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|This is an amazing book!! Read it time and time again, and each time it gets to me in a different way, depending on my life situation in that period of my life. It is inspiring and an eye-opener. I would recommend it to anyone, but specially those people who need a little push or guidance in something in their lives!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Downloaded it on a whim and now I can't put it down.  Very good story and graphics. Lots to do. Highly recommended
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Awesome performance. After hearing the album I am looking forward to seeing the movie. Very emotional performances by all cast members.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|thoroughly enjoyed this series the suspense continued throughout and the plot was well constructed I would recommend it to any Si Fi fan
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it. It It is the best game ever. Can't stop playing it.Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Fun little. game for the price. need a good connection to really enjoy. I'm having fun with it.<br />some of the items you can purchase are too much.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I give this book five stars because it's better than four stars and there doesn't seem to be a way to give it 4.5 stars.<br /><br />I really liked that the information in this book was presented in mostly a casual way.  It was a dry academic presentation of the material, although there is some technical information in the book it's mostly down to earth language that the average reader can understand.  Additionally, the book is well cited, which is always a plus for those willing to expand on the topic.<br /><br />Understanding for many years that continuously elevated insulin levels wreaks havoc on the body and mind, it never occurred to me to narrow down the culprit to wheat, or specifically gluten (which can also be found in barley, rye, and other sources).  For me, gluten was something to be avoided by people with CELIAC disease, while the rest of us could freely eat all the bread, pasta, barley, and rye our appetites could handle.  It turns out that a condition, NCGS (non celiac gluten sensitivity) may be more prevalent and potentially serious than previously believed.<br /><br />Doctor Davis goes on to describe potential effects of long-term, low-level sensitivity.  These include Alzheimer's disease, Heart disease, Adult onset Diabetes, Arthritis, and some Cancers, to name a few.  Even if the evidence is thin from a research point of view, the anecdotal evidence he provides from treating his own patients along with what data is available, paints just a clear enough picture for me to avoid what and gluten in general.<br /><br />This book would be a great read for anyone who just wants more information on the subject of diet and nutrition, anyone who may be suffering from diet related disease, or anyone trying to avoid dealing with disease.<br /><br />The one chapter I would have liked to see added to this book is the overall effects of elevated insulin in general.  I would have liked to see that chapter because the Doctor describes the fact that eating gluten free substitutes is not generally a great idea either.  He loosely eludes to the fact that controlling blood sugar in general is a good idea, and may carry greater benefit than just eliminating gluten.  Overall, I highly recommend this book, it's well worth the small amount of time it takes to read it.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|We throughly enjoyed our 3D experience with this beloved classic. We had not seen this version before and it was GREAT! We highly recommend it for young and old alike.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Good book! It's really interesting and cool seeing what it was like back then! Overall it's a book you should read..
B004W2UBYW|5.0|As a software engineer, there was some relatable stories and things i took away from the book besides the story of just making it. Would read again.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Okay I was hoping for the word sex to come p but it didn't so it is a weird thing hahaha
B009VB97EY|2.0|Initially I avoided it when it first came out. I watched it with a girlfriend because we both had not seen it. Not much to the movie. I don't care for movies where men or women flaunt their stuff on the screen and in your face. I should have followed my gut feeling when I first heard about it. Oh, well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The contents of this book have not only made me want to listen to better music, but have also made me think twice about an assumption made against a person. I never would  have guessed that his aunt was doing that to him, and I spent a lot of my time trying to figure out what was up with Charlie. In reality I fell in love with him, and can only hope that there are still pure hearted individuals out there. I was just taken aback at how amazing this story is, and the letter format made the reading very intimate. This book is radical, I loved it!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is absolutely my favorite new series.  The main and supporting characters are engaging, the give and take with Watson and Holmes is crisp and clever.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is by far the best game for kids and parents to enjoy alone or together. Very easy to understand and play. My daughter figured it out on her own and showed me how to play. I have no complaints about it.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I enjoyed the in depth look at Yemen and DeMille's (probably closer to the truth than we'd like) depiction of a CIA black op.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|No matter what anyone says I am in love with this series <3 it's dark, sexy, mysterious, and romantic! What more can you ask for
B0076DCT2G|4.0|seems really good - suspense not as much as the Lion books - in the middle so still open to finish
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really like the way it kept my attention. I wanted to rush to the end, very good. Thanks again
1594487154|5.0|A masterful work. The stories are relevant and poignant. and teach an undercurrent of thought<br />that can help anyone in this crazy informational overloaded 21st century understand human nature<br />with a new perspective.

B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I enjoy this cd so much and have played it everyday since I received it.  I hope there will be a follow up.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|for very simple calculations.  It would b even better if it could do a bit more complex mathematics.  Nothing too difficult. Just other than adding and subtracting.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I admit I'm a skeptic and a medical practitioner.  The book was well written, fairly convincing and a great family story of how to deal with someone in a prolonged coma.  I was reading right along and happily doing so when all of a sudden the book just ends - I thought something was wrong with my Kindle when it ended at 65% but apparently not.  From there it went into acknowledgements and the appendices.  I wanted more about his experience and I wanted more \\"proof\\".  The one thing I didn't want was information about his new foundation with a plea for money.  For some reason it was like a slap in the face with cold water.  I started thinking about the whole financial picture, the writing the book, the foundation etc. and frankly it sort of turned me off and it made me question the book and the experience.  I hope I'm just being critical and none of that is true but in todays greedy world it makes one pause.<br /><br />I'm glad I read it and I will recommend others read it and as I said I'm hopeful that his story is true...<br />I guess someday we'll all find out!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|It cound use more songs.  One slight problem, it will not let you play combinations of more than 2keys at on time.  Big dissapointment.  it would be great if that could be fixed.  I would still recommend it.  It is worth the price.  More songs and fix the combination to b able to play more than 2keys at one time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun for kids and adults. a little slow play but still fun! had a problem one day with the game not loading but 8 hrs later it was back
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|got to level 101 and kicked me out. had to reinstall and start over. but I now know what not to do

B006GLM5EQ|5.0|First of all, the actors and actresses are all drop dead gorgeous. Eye candy for sure. The show takes so many crazy turns and twists that I really can't predict what is happening next.  I do have to say that there is some real talent coming from the actors. They do have to portray some crazy characters and they do it so well.
B007MU85D0|3.0|There are a couple of 5 star songs on this album.  Dirty Paws, Mountain Sound, and Little Talks are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />However, I've found that the overall sound of the album wears on me.  It's hard to pinpoint it exactly.  I feel like maybe they overuse the \\"build to a dramatic crescendo\\" technique, or maybe the songs just sound too busy after a while.  If I hear some of their singles in a party mix or on the radio, I love them.  When I listen to the full album, I don't make it all the way through anymore (although, I did for a number of times after I purchased it).<br /><br />I liken it to Florence and the Machine's Ceremonials album.  This album isn't quite the power house of Cermonials, but Ceremonials wore on me in a similar way.<br /><br />Overall, worth the money, but not a timeless classic.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Martin is a great writer. I loved the first and second books, the third less so and this even less.<br /><br />There are too way many characters. Once the books took off like Wildfire, it seems the editor got lazy and just him run amok and everything passed muster. Way too many scenes that don't progress the story. Too many repetitive battles and jousting for power. A book, even ones this size, shouldn't need to list 80 pages of explanatory houses/characters at the end of each book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I had another Kindle calculator app that not only works just half the time, but freezes frequently and often won't let me ADD.  This one, downloaded quite on a whim, not only works well all the time so far, but actually makes my kindle fire LOOK like a giant calculator, which is really kind of cool.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Came in perfect condition and right on time as promised.  It's the trilogy with a special booklet and digital copies of each movie.  What's not to like?  Oh, and did I mention the price for this is the price of just the latest movie in stores?  Score.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|For Lee Child's first novel, Killing Floor (1997) was an exciting, fun read. I was thoroughly engrossed and entertained from start to finish. Although it took a lot of suspension of disbelief; some of the scenarios and situations were truly ridiculous...even in pre-9/11 1997.<br /><br />I was led to Child's first Jack Reacher novel by the release of the 2013 movie. The movie is actually based on Child's 2005 9th book in the Jack Reacher series called [[ASIN:B001AQHZ4M One Shot]], but I wanted to see how it all started before moving into the franchise.<br /><br />In this first novel Jack Reacher gets off a bus at an unexpected stop called Margrave, Georgia, but it might as well have been called The Twilight Zone. Reacher is immediately wrongly accused of murder in this town, cleared and drawn into a town corrupt in scandal and \\"phony baloney.\\" Reacher is a rough, tough character with a military police background that gets personally drawn into fixing the town of Margrave's corruption. And unlike the traditional methods used by police, Reacher--while extremely intelligent--prefers the methods of Rambo to exact his justice.<br /><br />But as a first time author might do, there are several flaws worth pointing out that make this book what hopefully will turn out to be an anomaly, because I've skipped ahead and am a chapter into spending the next couple of weeks with One Shot in advance of checking it out an film.<br /><br />Just a few of the glaring flaws with Killing Floor are:<br /><br />- A guy (Reacher) originally thought to be a vagrant murderer is accepted open-armed into a major police investigation as a civilian with virtual carte blanche to roam the local police precinct<br />- A couple of Feds are murdered publically, but no backup Feds ever arrive to see what's up<br />- An almost impossible abduction and violent murder occur in a crowded airport; nobody seems to notice and no one gets caught<br />- A high ranking police officer is viciously murdered, but not a single Fed (or news van!) shows up<br />- Reacher openly kills with reckless ruthlessness, and the local cops say, \\"What's the problem?\\"<br /><br />Other than that...great book!<br /><br />Killing Floor (a.k.a. Jack Reacher #1) is a quick easy read, and totally worth the time if, like me, you're looking for some back-story before reading the book (Jack Reacher #9) that inspired the movie.<br /><br />3 ½ stars.a single Fed (or news van!) shows up<br />- Reacher openly kills with reckless ruthlessness, and the local cops say, \\"What's the problem?\\"<br /><br />Other than that...great book!<br /><br />Killing Floor (a.k.a.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Everyone in the family had read this book and had comments about it...  both good and bad.  They all suggested that I read it.  I dis not think it lived up to its publicity and found the ending disappointing.  Really!  A continued life of conflict and misery.
B0051MKNV8|2.0|I got the movie in good time, about a week. At first viewing there were a few pixal issues half way thru the movie. The second time- MANY problems. Very disappointed in the quality. My email to the sender remains unanswered.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|...well at least from the ones I read.  This one comes in about third after Alex Haley's Malcolm X and David McCullough's John Adams.  I knew Steve Jobs what he had done and how awesome he was before the book....but now with all the behind the scenes stories and view points I am blown away with respect for what he truly accomplished, how, and why.  Candid multiple view points from Jobs himself to Gates, Eisner, and even Bono.

0525478817|5.0|I rented this book from the library a few weeks ago and loved it . I ordered it here because I want to be able to mark it up with my thoughts especially after reading John Green's FAQ about it. The book itself is in great condition, nothing is bent or folded and there are no marks on it.

0765325950|5.0|I read the book. Don't listen to all the selfish 1 star people crying about how this isn't on kindle yet.<br /><br />This is a deeply satisfying end to one of my favorite long standing series. Every major plot line is wrapped up in a satisfying way and literally kept me guessing to the very last page. Beautifully paced, action packed, tons of heart. Everything you want from The Wheel of Time and more.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I had some trouble opening it at first but now its fine. over all pretty fun. the tutorial was kinda confusing and I don't like the whole health and love points to compete but whatever. I would also like to create my own horse instead of just beauty

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love all you can do with. the horse. lots of very fun things. you can compete and groom and give treats and feed and get different horse tack to dress your very own horse in.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|Toole writes with such a wit as most people are wont to wish for.  &#34;Dunces&#34; reads as a modern day Dickens novel, except Dickens never knew the meaning of sardonic humor.
B001VVZ7Y6|5.0|Bfmv is the s*** love this cd and I saw there new cd will have tears don't fall part 2 on it hopefully it will be as good as the first. I listen to this every day every song is awesome and i'd recomend this cd or bfmv in general to anyone.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|The best book I have read for a long time! So sad but inspiring and beautifully written and regardless of the heartbreak it was rather amusing. Great characters. This is the first book I have read from JoJo Moyes but it won't be the last
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well written story.  A gripping tale that keeps surprising at every turn.  Highly recommended, can't wait to read the prequel.

1616550414|5.0|If you're a fan of the video game you'll love the history and stories behind all the games and characters.<br /><br />If you love to draw or want inspiration. The sketches and concept art will not dissappoint.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|Quick and easy app.  Different colors make it easy to manage and I don't need to search for something to write with!
B007HACDLK|3.0|As with other &#34;Mitch Rap&#34; novels this one runs true to form with Rap causing Chaos and saving area's of the world, as an action book I enjoyed it, however although the majority of the Story is set in Pakistan it could have been set anywhere in the world with little or no reference to local scenery way of life or lifestyle, I enjoy that in a book as for me it brings the written word to life.<br /><br />Two recent books I have read have done this &#34;Lay down with Lions&#34; and &#34;This angry Land&#34; Having traveled and worked in a lot of such places and other remote places the descriptions outside of the story are to me very enjoyable and gives a tase of life and culture in those places
