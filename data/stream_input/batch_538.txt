B00079FUI6|5.0|I am a married man and first recorded Desperate Housewives (DH) on VHS to watch later on after our kids were asleep due to its airing in the middle of the prime time format (before their bedtimes) and this was definitely NOT appropriate material for their ages (all below teen) plus it aired here during ESPN NFL Sunday night football.  Being married with kids, I thought I might enjoy this and somewhat identify, but unfortunately fell behind after only a few episodes and mixed up all the tapes since I stupidly didn't chronologically label/date each 2-episode tape which I tried in vain to do later.  Well, to make a long story short, I decided to wait for the DVD set and rented it at Blockbuster, saving all the tapes for this season.  Watching it on DVD, I found it to be far better than on broadcast tv, eliminating all the commercials and weekly cliffhangers.  I rented out all the discs sequentially and watched all the bonus features on them, especially the extended episodes.  DH has become one of my all-time tv faves... so much so that I have bought this DVD box set.  I am now caught up to this season and am religiously watching the show each week, never to fall behind or miss another episode again.  DH is comfort food... the characters are rich with hidden secrets, pasts, flaws, weakenesses and admirable qualities.  Like the writing and production of the ABC show \\"Lost\\" (another of my faves), creator,/writer/director/producer Marc Cherry has totally fleshed out his characters and involved them in amazingly well-written plots full of twists, turns and jaw dropping surprises.<br /><br />The four main housewives of Wisteria Lane in the ficticious city of Fairview are Lynette, Bree, Susan and Gabrielle.  Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria), aka Gabbie, is the self-centered, primadonna, former-supermodel Latina diva who is cheating on her rich, chauvinistic, alpha-male husband, Carlos Solis (Ricardo Chavira) with their gardner, John Rowland (Jesse Metcalfe), a high school boy.  Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher, an Emmy nominee) is the recently-divorced, cute, clutsy, emotional single mom of a teen-aged daughter, Julie (Amanda Bowen), who falls almost immediately for the new neighbor, a mysterious handsome plumber named Mike Delfino (James Denton) who is also a \\"scoring\\" target of her neighbor rival voluptuous, vixen, platinum blonde, realtor, Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan), whom with Susan is seemingly always in constant competition.  The prim, propper, well-mannered, immaculatelely dressed and groomed Bree Van De Kamp (Marcia Cross, an Emmy nominee) is an ultra-conservative, Baptist, NRA member, Republican socialite wife of a doctor, Rex Van De Kamp (Steven Culp) who on the outside is the homemaker/housewife extraordainaire with two teenagers, Andrew (Shawn Pyfrom) and Danielle (Joy Lauren) who seemingly are perfect kids, but this IS Wisteria Lane after all.  Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman, who won the Emmy) is a former ad-executive who gave up her career after marriage to her fellow ad-exec. husband Tom Scavo (Doug Savant), so that she could properly raise her four children... twin 8 year old boy hellions plus their one year younger brother and infant daughter. This over-burdened wife and mom is the epitome of a desperate housewife - Lynette is probably the most identifiable character on the show and therefore clearly earns the most audience empathy.<br /><br />Each episode opens with a nicely narrated recap/intro, wonderful Emmy-nominated title sequence and Emmy-winning theme by Danny Elfman and is wrapped up in poignant, narrative moralistic fashion.  The series' plot opens immediately with the apparent suicide of the four main housewives' neighboring wife group-hub and friend, Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) and is narrated (as well as acted) wonderfully throughout the entire series by her.  There are several clouds of mystery surrounding her suicide, including a mysterious blackmail-type of note.  This is pretty much the glue that holds all the subplots together, spawning several other subplots and introducing new characters as the series develops.  Whatever you do, do not watch this season or any of its coming attractions (change channels on commercial promos) until you have seen last season - you will miss way too much character and plot development.  DH clearly should have won the Emmy, but due to a major male voting portion of the academy's unfamiliarirty and the \\"Raymond\\" hype of closing the book on 9 successful seasons, it lost out to \\"Everybody Loves Raymond,\\" the sentimental choice.  It was far better production-wise (with some amazing camerawork), scripting, editing, directing, costuming, casting as well as acting.  I expect DH to win the Emmy for Best Comedy Series this season if it is nearly as good as it was in its debut year- so far, so good.  Last season, it won for six of the astonishing fifteen Emmy nominations it received.  In summary, DH is a guilty pleasure that really leaves you feeling not too guilty about enjoying it on a regular basis.<br /><br />10/10 stars - practically perfect, flawless television entertainmentholds all the subplots together, spawning several other subplots and introducing new characters as the series develops.

1400032717|3.0|I only read this book because it was loaned to me by a fellow special ed teacher; both of us have worked with children who have autism.  This story could have been told even more effectively without all of the swearing and profanity. It is an interesting story and portrays autistic thought patterns and behaviors quite well, but if anyone hands me another Haddon novel and I flip pages and see the same writing style, I will promptly hand it back.
0307276902|5.0|This book was highly recommended by Oprah and it lived up to its expectations. It is a true and graphic memoir that does not glorify or hide the cruelties of addiction or recovery. It was a fast read!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|How dare some of you critics talk trsh abouth this dvd. The sound is impecable, the lighting is the best in the bizz. That lizard king is wrong. he saying that roger waters doesn't perform on this. well he's just being listening to some crap recording of this marvelous concert. any true fan has had this concert on vhs for years and has highly anticipated this dvd. So to all who take the easier road and choose to critiqe this are not real fans of floyd and don't understand the greatness of this superior to all dvd
B0000B1OGD|3.0|Gila was a knockout! Due to Franciscus's part in both this and Beneath The Planet of The Apes comparisons have been made of Golan to Linda Harrison (Nova in BTPOTA). I read another found Harrison more attractive but I say Golan is Linda Harrison's physical equal. Golan is also a good actress. Her genuine warmth she demonstrates with the hyracotherium (mini ancient horse) is touching and this and in other ways in the film she shows to be a very fine actress.
B000002HK4|5.0|This Album is of a very high caliber, and comes from a very high caliber group of musicians. The first track really sets it off, as it combines all aspects of Dream Theater's sound into an amazing 23 minute audal epic. The song's amazing changes in tempo, style and energy still impress and inspire me. <br />     The other tracks on the album are wonderful, even the covers at the end! Im not usually to big a fan of covers, but these ones are actually done rather well, and in Dream Theater's own unique style. Rather than copy the styles of those various artists they cover, they take the songs and put a little bit of themselves in it. A must have for any progressive metal fan!

0393327655|1.0|After making some excellent points in the first 135 pages, Harris stumbles badly, and does not recover, once he attempts to claim that U.S. crimes cannot be compared to those of others because the U.S. is, in fact, a \\"well-intentioned giant\\". That Harris would buy into this argument in the face of historical fact points to the existence of a patholigical faith of his very own. His paragraphs addressing the My Lai massacre and his interpretation of so-called \\"collateral damage\\" explicitly demonstrate Harris' abject ignorance regarding the deliberate and systematic violence visited upon those who oppose U.S. hegemony. Harris may have some insights regarding religion, but his abysmally flawed understanding of geopolitics leads me to question his entire premise.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Arcade Fire sounds like a really good 80's pop band with orchestral accompaniment and better lyrics.  They also slowly build each song up to a climactic finish the way a jam band would.  This is easily the best album I've heard in months, and I would recommend this cd to any music fan.
B00005RHGK|4.0|The idea of traveling on the open road is both inviting and horrifying. On one hand, the road is paved with values that can shape and change your life. On the other more mysterious and deadly hand, the road is filled with the worst thing of all, the unknown. \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" seems to capture that perfectly. Instead of coming to the unknown a la \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\", the unknown comes to them. That's a scary thought...<br /><br />Justin Long and Gina Phillips as the two protagonists, Darry and Trish, are driving home to see the old family. Along the way, across barren terrain, they are daunted by an unusual, hollowed out truck that almost throws them from the road. It's only later down the road when they see it again, but by then, they're already a part of something much bigger.<br /><br />\\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is by far one of the better horror films to have come out in the past ten years. There's something original and real in the whole mess. Victor Salva, the director, never tries to be overly stylistic and keeps the film simple. There are dark edges, but never too dark (i.e. Alex Proyas, David Fincher) and the film never sets a certain date, leaving the audience to feel very general about the whole thing. In a way, the film is a bit timeless.<br /><br />Story wise, Salva creates two great characters. Darry and Trish are perfect examples of young adults in any generation. Not to mention both Philips and Long play them very well with such chemistry too. I like how it's a brother and sister ordeal and not the usual boyfriend and girlfriend motif that's been outdone in horror films, especially for the past twenty years. There's a lot going for it. While I must admit the film's first half is stronger over the latter, it's the ending that makes this film most memorable and actually horrific. Ballsy might be a good word for it.<br /><br />Between the fluid storyline, the dark visuals, chilling soundtrack (of course, the title track too), \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is one of the better modern horror films to have come out in awhile. Just stay far, far away from the sequel...<br /><br />That's a scary thought in itself.is one of the better modern horror films to have come out in awhile.

B00005JKWJ|1.0|Blade 2 is possibly one of the worst movies ever.<br /><br />Not only is there a lack of story, but the film harnesses and uses some of the worst CGI I've ever seen. This film opened up a whole new gateway to crap CGI too.<br /><br />For more information, see the scene in front of the huge lights, somewhere near the beginning of the film.<br /><br />Or just watch as Blade moves like a cut scene from a Playstation 1 game.<br /><br />Yep, another rant to a horrible movie that needs to be showcased that way.
0307276902|5.0|I really can't say enough about this book. Talk about stripping down to the heart and soul of a horrible part of your life. I found this book to be raw, inspiring and a reality check! There is nothing you can't overcome in life and James proves that. His style of writing really pulls you in and flows so naturally until you realize you have reached the last page. Beautiful. I just received My Friend Leonard and can't wait to get into it.
B00007ELEL|4.0|I don't want to downgrade the movie by giving this edition 1-star, but this new edition of \\"Lebowski\\" deserves 1-star.      Much like the opening credits sequence of \\"Lebowski\\" is one of my favorite opening credits sequences, so too is the teaser trailer (with its 9-way split screens) one of my favorite teaser trailers.  I remember I first saw the \\"Lebowski\\" teaser in theaters, years ago, in front of \\"The Game\\" and I remember laughing aloud, thrilled to see the new Coen trailer but also seriously wondering, \\"What the hell is that all about?\\"      But now the teaser has been removed from the DVD.  Which kind of sucks.  I also had to remove my old \\"Lebowski\\" review in order to review this new edition.  Do you see what happens?  They're out of their element.
B000002MJR|5.0|The First five songs off this live CD are the best!!! But there <br />could have been some songs removed, Your Last Trick, and You and <br />Your Friend and better choices from the DVD that rock are The <br />Bug, and Solid Rock. Great CD anyway, Walk Of Life, Heavy Fuel, <br />& Romeo and Juliet are my favorite hard rockers off this. <br />Buy all their live CDs.
B000B5IPLK|4.0|The best moments on this LIVE project are brought in by guests stars rather than Keys herself, the first is \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\" duet with Damian Marley the son of Bob Marley the Prophet and \\"Diary\\" where Jermaine really takes our breathe away with his Raphael Saadiqish sound, what a smooth performance and voice! Alicia needs to step away from the piano sometimes as the videos are a bit boring.<br /><br />A reviewer was surprised that MTV has \\"revived\\" Unplugged performances because 90% of the artists today can't perform live anyway and criticised Alicia's vocal performance on this album... People have to know that if MTV did this again it's because the world has discovered a soulful voice and genuine artist and not just those who sell their bodies and have to shake their as* for their albums to go platinum. She's able to play anything and sing anything in her own style and she imitates no one. She's also the first female artist in any genre to launch an  Unplugged album at Number One, beating past MTV Unplugged projects by Mariah Carey, Lauryn Hill, Alanis Morissette and  Shakira. Stop being negative guys and give respect to pure artistry!<br /><br />on 1st December 2004 (World AIDS Day), there was a charity concert called \\"Keep a Child Alive\\" organised by Alicia Keys and the legendary Babyface to raise money and awareness for the cause and hence provide AIDS drugs to ill Africans. She brought in Babyface for a duet on John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" that was extremely marvelous and breathtaking. I wish she had invited Babyface, Prince or Stevie Wonder on the stage! Anyway she seems to prefer MCs like Mos Def and Common!!
B00000DGUY|4.0|I don't know about this damn collection. Delete some songs, songs <br />like Local Hero, and Your Latest Trick need to be deleted and <br />better choices could be the lovely songs that I love so much, <br />Skateaway, and Expresso Love. Why would they put Your Latest <br />Trick, not their best song. Another bad thing about this damn <br />collection is that it has Money for Nothing, but it is edited <br />from 8 minutes to 4 minutes. I'm afraid my lord, you shouldn't <br />buy this collection, but if you are new to Dire Straits, you <br />may want this and Making Movies together.

Hands down, one of the silliest pieces of tripe I have ever read in my life.  <br /> <br />Anyone who sucks on this candy is missing a large part of the ingredients of life. Simply mindless dribble...  <br /> <br />But do read it to see how gullible people can be while seeking false and confused prophets to guide their less than remarkable lives. Seriously, a good dose of watching the evening sunset would do a person a lot better than getting twisted in this supercilious \\"plot\\" of meandering superstition and nonsense.  <br /> <br />Truly one of the lamest books I have ever read.

B00008PX8P|5.0|Have you ever held the Rosetta Stone? This DVD Release is masterful and puts all of the (thousands) pretenders in their rightful place. If for nothing else, the performance of \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" at Knebworth in 1979 is worth the price of this collection alone. The track is simply the blue print for everything that followed in Rock. Sure, Metallica plays it faster but the core of it all was laid out right there in a 10:08 lesson. I am a person of faith and I worship gods- I want to watch Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham, strut, crush, and redefine music. I don't want to watch some group of kids that met in the audio-video club in high school crank out garage anthems! Keep your Weezer, Barenaked Ladies,Maroon 5, Blink 182... It is just as true today as it was in 1968- LED ZEPPELIN RULES!
B00008PW3O|5.0|This is my favorite Fleetwood Mac album. With a wide variety of songs that range from catchy-pop, to ethereal, hypnotic and lyrically introspective, this has been the most frequently played album in my collection for the past year (that and the newest Crosby and Nash album). As experiemental as Tusk, but without the expectations and definitely more accessable, this album is never far from my cd player.<br /><br />I wish I could have been around when Rumours (a totally killer album) was first released so that I could guage the music based on the time period in which it was released against other albums of the time. Being as I was only born in 1982, I only have my limited exposure to Fleetwood Mac's albums (which is slightly out of context being as I can't experience their albums as they impacted the time they were released). I know what my ears have an affinity to like and they love this album.<br /><br />Lyndsey Buckingham is obviously the brainchild of this album. In Christine McVie's absence, he no doubt felt the need to fill the void left where her formidable organ use to reside filling out the songs with his lush, multiple tracked, melodic and sometimes spastic guitar parts. This man's ability create moods with his guitar is amazing. The production quality of this cd is clear and warm. The use of reverbs and filters, coupled with some unique and eclectic song-writing enables this album to transcend being a collection of simple-pop songs (although there are some simple pop songs as well), and adds to the various moods of the album. His songs are my favorites on this cd. Murrow Turning Over is hypnotic and the vocal overdubs and use of tinny guitar overdubs makes this weird song a stand out for me. His pop sensibilities are still intact in songs like Peacekeeper and What's The World Coming To. I always liked Lyndsey's lyrics because it always seemed like they weren't limited to love (unlike Christine McVie, who's voice was great, but lyrical content always seemed shallow and formulaic to me). Exceedingly cool guitar parts like the main riff on Miranda, the finger picking on Red Rover, Say Goodbye and the steamy Come, not to mention his underrated lead guitar that covers various styles (spanish in Smile at You, more traditional on Running Through the Garden, spastic on Murrow Turning Over, blistering on Come) makes Lyndsey one of my top three favorite guitarists. His voice is equally cool and unique. His choice of strange harmony (the ninth on \\"everyone's gone to the moon\\" in What's The World Coming To, and Red Rover are examples) adds to the flavor of this album.<br /><br />Stevie is in great form here, and with Lyndsey's help, has arranged some exceptionally cool songs (she was always a formidble songwriter in her own right after all). I've always loved this gals unique voice and the chemistry of harmony potential between her and Lyndsey. The sum is definitely greater than the parts with these two. They're just better together. Although her voice has gotten deeper(probably from smoking... at times Lyndsey sounds higher than her), her vocal performances on this album are very effective. My favorites include her own song Smile at You, and her screechy singing on Lyndsey's song Come. I'm not a big fan of Illume' because it doesn't seem to go anywhere... but the 9-11 tribute is sincere and I can appreciate it lyrically. It's the only song i don't care for on the album, and it's still highly listenable.<br /><br />John McVie's bass playing is quite impressive and intelligent on this album. On Smile At You, McVie's cool chromatic bass line adds tension and helps Stevie propel the song. Mick Fleetwood's use of auxillary percussion and steady non-encroaching style makes for some very groovin' music. There's a reason they named this band after this stellar rhythm section.<br /><br />If you're Christine McVie fan, I can see how she might be missed and I suggest getting her new solo album In The Mean Time. Personally, I feel that Lyndsey makes up for her absense with light hearted tunes such as Steal Your Heart Away and Bleed to Love Her (where you can hear Christine's Beautiful voice adding back-up vocals). If you're not a diehard Mac fan, I wouldn't buy the bonus disc version of this album (although I love the bonus material... especially lyndsey's Bob Dylan cover). The live versions of the songs are quite similar to the studio, but with some variation in vocal performance... lyndsey's use of chest voice on bleed to love her, \\"somebody's got to see this through..\\" is very cool. This is an impressive collection of songs considering most people thought they had dried up.

B000AARKOO|3.0|This film gets three stars for only one reason: the costuming was quite good and period-accurate.  However, the story itself is not particularly accurate.   <br /> <br />Firstly there is the problem of the metrosexual Orlando Bloom.  He plays yet another blacksmith who has somehow acquires sword skill to defeat three Templars (at once).  Must be because he hangs around swords so much, the innate knowledge just kind of seeps in.  Right...he lacks the emotion for the role of leader in the film, ordering about genuinely tough-looking strong men.  Just no commanding presense, and a poor lead-role choice.   <br /> <br />The major Battle of Hattin, the turning point of that particular Crusade, is also significantly missing.  It's mentioned, but not for very long.  THis makes no sense, as it was the most important conflict in the entire Crusade!   <br /> <br />Thirdly, we have the Templars being cast in an inappropriately bad light.  They simply were not the savage, rough, conniving brutes the film makes them out to be.   <br /> <br />A minor point, once again there are flaming trebuchet projectiles.  Need I remind anyone they didn't have gasoline at the time to set them afire like that?  And what would be the point anyway, you can't burn stone... <br /> <br />Sadly, this is all the history some people are likely to ever get.  Alas for mankind...

B0007GAEW6|5.0|I first got into the mars volta after trying out at the drive-in first. I really REALLY liked the odd sounding songs like non-zero possobitity, so a friend told me I should try the mars volta out. At first I liked the cd, but after repeated listenings of it I now absoulutley love it.  <br /> <br />  Technically this is a album that has 5 songs on it. First is Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus a 5 part epic song, great opener to a extrodanry album. I think this is my  favorite song. Next is the radio-friendly The Widow. It is alrite, but lacks a little compared to the rest of the album. L'Via L'Viaquez follows with some of the best musicianship in music today. I absoulutley love cedrics vocals on this song. Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore is kinda a build up to the albums longest peice, but it stands out pretty well on its own. Cassandra Geminni is a song that has been cut into 8 different sections, but I personally cant listnen to just on part of it, I have to take it in as a whole.  <br />  This is a phenomonal album. I highly advice it to fans of other projects buy cedric and omar. This is worth every penney. <br /> <br /> <br />
6305428042|4.0|I am personally not big on scary movies, so my options are limited at Halloween. When I found this movie I was sceptical at first, but then found myself sucked into the fun! <br />The Sanford sisters are very funny, played by Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and another very funny lady. The costumes are great, and Thora Birch who plays the sister of the main character does a great job, and I am hard to impress with child actors.  <br />It's good for a holiday spooky and funny movie, there is a bit of mature language for small children though, depending on how protective you are of your children, and some dark ideas, but this is typical of Halloween. It's now a classic in my collection.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Ok, admittedly, I was neither a big Soundgarden or Rage fan.  I had heard songs from both bands and I knew of Chris Cornell (and honestly, only really noticed him on the Temple of the Dog video for Hunger Strike and thought he was hotter than Eddie Vedder, but that was about the extent of my interest).  I LOVE Audioslave and my admiration for the group's combined efforts has led me to re-evaluate my opinions (or lack thereof) of Soundgarden and Rage and I am willing to check them out in closer detail now.  I do not expect the old bands to sound anything like Audioslave.  While it is natural to be biased, I must offer a criticism of those people out there who were fans of Rage and Soundgarden who complain that Audioslave sucks in comparison to their previous groups.  PEOPLE!!!!  Audioslave is a different band than the last two groups.  They are not trying to make copy-cat versions of their old bands.  They are trying to be unique in their own right.  Yes, Audioslave is a combined effort of some great musicians, but does that mean that they have to sound like \\"Rage Against the Garden\\"????  NO!  Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but if you're going to offer a critique, make it based on some real, valid points, like they suck because Morello can't play the guitar or Cornell can't sing (blasphemous!)....Not because they don't sound like their old selves.  Thanks for listening!  This is a fantastic CD and you should own it if you want to hear Chris, Tom, Brad, and Tim make some beautiful NEW music together!  Their sophomore cd is definitely better than the first and I can't wait for the next cd to come out.  They are even better in concert!
B0002S947K|4.0|I purchased this album almost a year ago after chatting with a friend in California.  So I popped in the album and gave it a listen.  On the first take I thought it was pretty good, however I don't believe I recognized the greatness of this album until a few more listens.  This is by far one of the best albums I have purchased all year.  Ray's voice is somewhat similar to Van Morrison, very raspy and rough yet filled with the emotion of Ryan Adams.  The songs are filled with an acoustic guitar, piano, harmonica, and very stripped down similar to Damien Rice's \\"o\\" and Ben Harper's \\"Welcome to the Cruel World\\".  Each track is filled with different feelings about love, addictions, violence,women, etc.  The album starts off with \\"Trouble\\", which is the main single.  It's a good song no doubt, however there are much better songs hidden in the mix.  Favorites include \\"Hannah\\" and \\"Jolene\\", but there is really not a poor song on the list.  Although no poor songs, there are some average ones that don't fully impress such as \\"Forever my Friend\\" and \\"All the wild horses.\\"  I would compare Ray to a Damien Rice, Ryan Adams, Ben Harper and even a young Bob Dylan.  The album is very folksy, bare, and posesses a somewhat depressing feel.  I think Ray should add a female vocalist to more of his songs.  I would definitely recommend the purchase of this album which is no doubt probably one of the finest around right now.  Nice debut!

B0002IVN9W|5.0|The first time I listened to Funeral, I was confused. Did I find something I absolutely loved, or was I weirded out by his wavering voice? I didn't know, but I was intrigued by the gorgeous soaring piano on \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\". So I put it on again. And again. And again. <br /> <br />And now Funeral is one of my all-time favorite records. And I mean seriously. There is nothing like an album that you can put on and become completely immersed in, and Funeral is one of those. There are parts where it is beautiful, where it is raw, where it is melancholic, and where it is anthemic.  <br /> <br />It's one of those albums that I have to listen to in order. I can't just listen to a track here and a track there. But if I did have to pick a few favorites, they would be \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\", \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\", and \\"Wake Up.\\"  <br /> <br />But seriously, just put it on and let it go.
B0002OERI0|1.0|anyone who thinks this album was groundbreaking should turn off MTV and educate themselves as to what a sellout is.  i used to enjoy their music, but this was simply just a commercial success.  there is nothing melodic or original about their music.  if they put as much time into writing and performing good music as they do putting on makeup and selling there songs to yahoo music, they may be able to create something tolerable.  they represent our society and it's decadent taste in music.  we no longer want to think, we just want some easy-to-digest, emotionless crap that allows us to drive and talk on our cell phones while we listen to it...god save the queen (and our taste in music)
B00005JMUA|1.0|Quentin Tarantino has an issue with self-indulgence this time around. There are a few scenes that seem like they could've been cut out in the editing room without a problem, or at least shortened. Nothing of any real significance appears to be going on, and whether or not these moments get better in any repeat viewing, they can come off as extremely pointless. The only thing exciting about this movie is when the woman pulled the other woman's eye out.
B00005AQGH|4.0|This is still a great album  I just dont think it really compares to his best release all eyez on me as a follow up, this album has some of my favourite tupac songs ever but it just doesnt have enough consistency and I really wish that he released the extended version as the album because 12 tracks with an intro and a few weaker songs just isnt good enough i still highly reccomend this album I just would expect it to be his best work, my favourite songs are as follows <br />Hail Mary   <br />Toss It Up   <br />To Live & Die In L.A.   <br />White Man'z World    <br />Me And My Girlfriend   <br /> <br />   <br />
B0007P3582|1.0|I admit Get Rich Or Die Tryin was a good album but this SUCKED! There are about 2 good beats on this album but that is it. 50 Cent is terrible all he talks about is how he got shot 9 times and says G-unit. He is going to get old soon. I wasted 15 bucks. The Game is killin him! G-UNOT!
B00000055E|4.0|this album is decent, by no means his best work, but it still has a fair amount of songs that can easily be concidered classic material, I dont think that it is as concistent as his previous release like all eyez on me and me against the world but is stilla great listen with few weak tracks. The best songs are as follows  hell razor  do for love  i wonder if heaven got a ghetto  lie to kick it
B000AL730Y|5.0|Great, awesome, intimate, powerful, simple but complex at the same time. It's McCartney from the very first note till the end. It's his \\"taste\\" everywhere. This is probably one of the best albums in his history. God save Paul, not only the Queen. <br /> <br />
B000AADYYO|5.0|As you can tell from my extremely catchy title, I was excited for this album. Even on the same year that Porcupine Tree released \\"Deadwing\\" and Dream Theater released \\"Octavarium\\" I was most excited for this. I remember three years ago when I first heard \\"The Moor\\" (off of the highly reccomended \\"Still Life\\") I was blown away by the amazing musicianship of Opeth. I remember being hyped up for Deliverance and Damnation and them delivering greatly (unlike some people I think all of their albums are masterpieces).  <br /> <br />I had heard \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" before the album came out and I was dissapointed. Had the signing to Roadrunner changed Opeths' style completely? I was hopeful that it didn't, and I was right. <br /> <br />The first track on the album is \\"Ghost of Perdition\\". It's a perfect example and representative of the album. It's a classic Opeth song with many heavy and soft transitions and parts. Very similar to something off of \\"Still Life\\" or \\"Blackwater Park\\" (which I was happy to hear). Overall, it's a great song, eaily in my top 20 Opeth songs and in my top 3 for the whole album. <br /> <br />Next comes \\"The Baying of the Hounds\\". Mikeal introduces us to a new style of vocals during this song (Everything you believied is a lie...etc.) which is always good to hear. The song is one of the heaviest songs on the album even though it has one of the best slow parts on the entire album. Watch out for the guitar solo, it's a classic one. <br /> <br />Now, my favorite song on the album \\"Beneath the Mire\\". I was blown away by it the first time that I heard it. It sounded like something Opeth had never done before. I was intriged. Mikeals death vox in the first part of the song are just crushing, like usual. The trasitionn into the slower part of the song is amazing, one of my favorite parts on the whole album. It's only flaw is the semi-annoying ending. <br /> <br />\\"Atonement\\" follows and it is a nice little song with a middle-eastern type feel to it. It's a nice soothing song, very good. Then comes \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\" which I have mixed feelings about. It's been growing on me a lot lately, and I think that it has some truly amazing parts. But, it has some incredibly dull parts as well. Some riffs are just repeated too much (especially the dreadful ending) but a lot of the parts in the song are my favorite moments on the album. Specifically, this part: <br /> <br />\\"It is all false pretension  <br />Harlequin forest  <br />Awaiting redemption for a lifetime  <br />As they die alone  <br />With no one by their side  <br />Are they forgiven?\\" <br /> <br />I get shivers everytime I listen to that. <br /> <br />Next is the amazing \\"Hours of Wealth\\". The first 2 minutes are amazing, great instrumental work, I love it. It reminds me of \\"Drige for November\\". Mikeal's vocla son this song are simply stunning in this song, and so is the solo. Flawless song. <br /> <br />Then comes my least favorite song on the album \\"The Grand Conjuration\\". I think it's a bit too boring and repetitive for Opeth. It's basically a 10-minute song centered around the same rehashed riffs from earlier in the song. The solo is nice though, the rest just isn't. <br /> <br />The album closes with \\"Isolation Years\\", a nice little song to close everything out.  <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECCOMENDED <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|The album to me is a commercial friendly flop. The music at one time meant something, now it seems the band is simply out to continue making money and using the U2 name and there songs to benefit charity and other things which is very good. But what happened to the dedication and focus on the music? \\"lets just sound like Joshua Tree and just make some generic songs..\\" <br /> <br />I don't know where the band is headed but this album is boring. <br />Not too many good things here. A few tracks are memorable, the opening track gets annoying after a few listens and then the CD gets put on the shelf or in the discount bins. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and look for U2's other albums. Even U2's POP album has a little more to offer than this.
0307276902|5.0|Unbelievable. No, that's not right. Utterly believable, heart-wrenching, thought-provoking, and hard to resist. I couldn't put it down. I immediately ordered My Friend Leonard, which I finished in 24 hours as well. Now I'm mourning my loss of having a daily dose of James and company. I am just thankful I had some moments to share James' life, and would have loved to have known Leonard, too. Thank you, Mr. Frey, for your honesty, your reality, and your wisdom. It makes me want to be a better person.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|While Batman Begins has taken the title of \\"best bat-flick\\", this 1989 rendition is still a classic! Michael Keaton, while not as brutal or intimidating as Christian Bale's version of Batman, still captures the essence of The Dark Knight!<br /><br />Jack Nicholson as The Joker is still the best villian ever in the whole franchise series! Even the talented Liam Nielson in the new Batman flick couldn't take that title! I almost feel sorry for whoever plays The Joker in Christopher Dolan's next Batman feature! He better be damn good because Nicholson's performance will be a tough act to follow!<br /><br />This version is more Gothic and while spotty in places, it is still a solid flick! I plan on buying this new two disc version myself just to have this classic along side Batman Begins!<br /><br />On a side note, the only other ones I would even consider purchasing are \\"Batman Returns\\" and perhaps \\"Batman Forever.\\" I know the latter was by Joel Schumacher BUT \\"BF\\" was a far better film than that hot mess he made later called \\"Batman & Robin\\"!<br /><br />Back to the subject at hand, this version has many solid performances! Add this to your Bat-collection!
1401200923|4.0|So Volume II is better than the first. Lee's artwork takes on a darker approach, as if he's found his stride and is now running with it. Loeb's story gets better too! It barrels along and takes no prisoners.<br /><br />On the overall, I liked Hush. It was sometimes a little predictable but it was a good Batman yarn. The villain was interesting and scheming to the almost the same level as the author, which is convenient, if you ask me.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|I have to say, I did not 'get' this film. At all. I sat watching it this morning, after getting up, and thought \\"Why?\\" But it's also one of those films that sucks you in, and then spits you back out at the end. I ended up half way through, not liking the film, but not wanting to switch it off either. I was giving it the benefit of the doubt, and ended up wasting my time.<br /><br />Why did I hate this film so much? Probably cos I recognised the lead character, and many other viewers will. There is a Napoleon Dynamite in every school. He's the guy who's not quite grown into his limbs yet, and can't quite work them. He doesn't really have a strong family background, and that reflects into his daily life. He has no friends, and no girls appear to fancy him. Mainly because he needs a serious makeover, contacts, a decent hairdresser, and braces. Poor Jon Heder must have been sick of that dazed look by the end of filming. And even the friend he makes, Pedro, he adopts the same look towards the end.<br /><br />Also, his 'uncle' Rico, was a complete & utter sleaze. Ladies, while watching this film, you will hate this man. Hate him with such a passion, you will want to make sure he never reproduces. Ugh. He does kinda get his comeuppance, but who's the chick on the bike?<br /><br />I actually thought Napoleon's brother was quite a sweetie, and although his attire looked really stupid towards the end, it was better than what he started out with!<br /><br />I'm really sorry to say that I didn't like this. It's one of those films, you've read so many good reviews about it, you WANT to like it. I thought, I'll give it a few more minutes, I'll keep watching, but honestly, I think you either have to be drunk or stoned to watch this movie. (No offence.) And I was neither. Oh well. Sorry.
0307276902|5.0|A Million Little Pieces, is one of the most gripping books I have read in a very  long time. James Frey takes you on a trip into his world of recovery from drugs and Alcohol. The wording is very gritty and shocking. But, you will not be able to put this book down. I literally found myself hanging onto his every word. This book is truly a page turner. Oprah was right!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|In 2002, when Fox was busy mishandling then cancelling prematurely this wonderful series, 'Firefly,' my family and I were utterly unaware of the show's existence. Then again, how could we have been? Fox is not exactly known for its great programming, and 'Firefly' only lasted 11 episodes (14 were shot but only 11 aired). Further, the two-hour first episode was not aired first, but last.  <br /> <br />It was not until this year (2005), while we were at a local library (we visit at least once per week), that we chanced upon DVDs of the series. On a whim, and because we love science fiction and fantasy and comedy and history (pretty much in that order), we took the two DVDs (there are four) the library had home with us and found ourselves immediately hooked. <br /> <br />We watched those episodes repeatedly. And then we bought the whole (if abbreviated) series from Amazon.com.  <br /> <br />I mean, we loved it so much we just could not bear to be without it! <br /> <br />We learned to loathe Fox for mishandling and cancelling this series. <br /> <br />When the film, 'Serenity' (the name of the spaceship in the 'Firefly' television series)  came out, we bought the tickets immediately and were there for the very first showing. And we LOVED it! <br /> <br />Afterward, we hounded imDB.com to see how the film was doing at the boxoffice; because we knew the only chance for us to get any more 'Firefly'/'Serenity' was if the film did well. <br /> <br />'Serenity' made it to number 2 in the US market in its first week but fell from the top 10 thereafter (probably because familiarity with the series is necessary to fully appreciate the film). But (after several weeks) it is still number 1 in Great Britain (which only goes to show that they have better taste there than we do here)! <br /> <br />My children are now \\"Browncoats\\" (an online 'Firefly'/'Serenity' fan membership group) and are avid fans (as are my wife and I). And we all boycott Fox (except any good sci fi shows they might program someday) and all \\"reality tv\\" and the usual garbage (especially anything with Hip-Hop in it) programming. <br /> <br />Needless to say, when the film, 'Serenity', makes it to DVD, we will order our copy from Amazon.com without a moment's hesitation. (But we are hoping that the foreign market keeps buying tickets and thus postponing the film's DVD release.) <br /> <br />It is hard to believe that we would like a television series better than Farscape and Babylon 5; but, fact is, we just cannot get our fill of 'Firefly'/'Serenity.' The idea that there may not ever be any more episodes or film releases is almost unbearable, especially for my children. <br /> <br />Here is hoping that Joss Whedon (the writer/director) continues to be driven to make more 'Firefly'/'Serenity' and the avid fan base grows enough, and ticket and DVD sales do well enough, to attract the financing to make more. And here is hoping that he can keep most of that wonderful cast together somehow. <br /> <br />If not, it would be a shame. <br /> <br />Happily, my children are all exceedingly creative and gifted; so, what with their music, art, writing, animation, and fledgling filming, I suspect that the future may have even better experiences in store for those lucky enough to live there.
0307276902|5.0|This was a gripping -- sometimes gruesome -- account of James Frey's battle with addictions.  I hope to read the sequel now, too.  How fabulous for Frey that he was able to not only turn his life around, but also to make something positive out of many years of tormented hell.   <br /> <br />I get why Oprah chose this book.  James's philosophy is directly in sync with Oprah's own, that what we do or don't do (take drugs, overeat, whatever) is based on the DECISIONS that we continually make every day of our lives. <br /> <br />Thank you, James, and thank you, Oprah.
B0002OERI0|3.0|Greenday's \\"American Idiot\\" is a very nice album, \\"Boulevard of broking dreams\\" is a real hit, so is \\"wake me up when september ends\\", and I'm afraid that's it. Surely there are more nice songs in here, but to tell you the truth, I really expected for more. <br />Don't take it the wrong way, if you'll get this one, I'm sure you will enjoy it, but I had my hopes for something greater, but That shouldn't suggest it's not a good album.
0440214041|3.0|This is a good author; in this story he lingers too long to let you uncover the theme of the plot; perils of the pelicans in the Mississippi Delta by pestizides swamped into the wetlands, killing avians like the pelicans to the brink of extintion. It is the greed of a few who want the oil, as greed is always the human tragedey and malady. Way too many new names of insignificant characters are introduces out of nowhere and spoil the story. I was surprised this story fascinated the movie industry. The heroine is not believable in this plot, the corruption of the White House is.
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson's \\"Braveheart\\" may deceive you at first, thinking that the story is about a loving and caring man, who's searching for love and peace. Well, at least one of those lasts is true, but the way to get them is long and tough. This touching, and I must add also hurting story, makes its way through an amazing (and well directed) battles, which you'll well enjoy if you have a fine home theatre set. <br />The story takes place at the amazing view of Scotland and England, that explains perfectly just how much that land is worth dying for, and how much freedom is hard to get. <br />This movie features an amazing performance, and its touching story may make you shed a tear every now and then. This is one dvd you must have in your home. I own it, and even though I only watch it every few months, it is a special experience. Every time  it's like watching it for the first time. Don't think twice.
B000065U1N|4.0|It's a great movie, I hightly recommend it if you like war movies, or any genre. It does get gory, but that, and the language, is why it's rated-R. Overall, I loved it, it was amazing, teriffic acting, directing, all of it!
B0001KO9QA|5.0|This one is it!!  The original versions.  I love the Blue holographic box and the extra making of video within it.  This was the very first widescreen release on Vhs for the star wars trilogy originally released in 1992. These were the films as originally presented in 1977, 1980, and 1983.  I love looking back every once in a while at this set with all its flaws.  It's a pleasure.  I do not slam George Lucas for going back to improve on his original work though.  I feel they are actually better in that way.  Id also like to note on the comment that the classical composers mozart, etc. didnt go back to improve their work.  Well, sorry to bust that reviewers bubble but those composers went through several incarnations of their masterpieces before arriving at what we all recognize today!!  Id also like to note that I have an extra set of this letterbox collectors edition that has NEVER BEEN OPENED. I may consider selling it to interested parties.
B0007P3582|2.0|Wow im amazed some of you havent mentioned some of the other rappers who helped the whole rap concept and made it mainstream..MC8, Easy E, Sir mix alot..(Kinda)..Erase E, Boss Ballin, Too short, DJ Quik, Outkast,salt n pepa, JJ Fad and many more helped paved a way for new artist to create and recreate in some cases these artists masterpieces into something new. Then comes along some crap hole like 50 cent whos awesome marketing team thought up a way to promote him quickly to destroy everything artitst had worked to accomplish..Every song or album 50 cent produces is another brick fallin from that empire that we call rap..Every building has its breaking point..you take away to many bricks it falls..same with rap you take away all the talent and VOILA its gone. Im dissapointed with rap to date..I would rather listen to country and them talkin about how they wanna \\"Hump a horse..kill a cowboy\\" or something like that. Anyway just my 2 cents.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Plans, much like The Photo Album, feels like a compromise.  The last two songs in particular show this.  \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\" is compelling, but it ends in the wrong place and feels incomplete.  Then, \\"Stable Song\\" is just a condensed version of \\"Stability\\" from an EP a few years ago.  The lyrics of the song don't match those on the rest of the album, even though by itself it's a great listen, improving on the original by cutting out the mostly pointless eight-minute ending.  That being said, the winning tracks here (all except \\"Crooked Teeth\\") are wonderful examples of the band evolving their sound, as they have generally done with each release.  This is not a guitar-pop album, but a more electronic one.  The electronic style is nothing like that of the Postal Service, however, and I think those comparisions are unfair.  All in all, a great album, just a bit rushed I think.
078322611X|5.0|This is one of the best \\"feel good\\" movies of all times.  It's beautiful story line is so good that it is not even affected by the naivity of Costner's acting.  I might even say this might be the only movie it does contribute to the success.
0895260131|4.0|Indeed, this book is and does what is promised: it will clear some fog. <br /> <br />Below is a link to an interview with the author about the book. <br />It will show you who the author is and what the book is about. <br />More importantly, it also contains a message for peace. <br />[...] <br /> <br />If there is to be(come) peace between hardcore Muslims <br />and non-Muslims, this book and the linked interview are <br />the starter tools to do it. But first we need to clear some fog. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000042MY|4.0|This is one movie I could watch over and over. The music is very special to me and I found about 5-6 pieces on the CD that I play over and over. Just feel so upbeat and good while listening and the beat goes on and on in my head for the rest of the day.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Yes, I understand that this could be considered somewhat of a prequel to the 4 other Batman movies of recent Hollywood endeavor. Tim Burton's two films Batman and Batman Returns were very entertaining. Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever was fair, but Schumacher's Batman and Robin was absolutely atrocious (think the TV series)!<br /><br />Batman Begins is so head and shoulders above any of the aforementioned that it would be okay with me if Christopher Nolan just took the franchise from the beginning and went forward...yes even steamrolled right over Burton's versions of The Joker (who wants to think of Jack Nicholson when they think of the Joker anyway?), the Penguin and Catwoman.<br /><br />The title of Batman Begins is the best description of the movie. We see exactly why Batman is Batman. What happened in his childhood, his training, how he gets all those cool devices and toys including a modern day, very realistic Batmobile...the Tumbler (out are the stupid nicknames Batmobile, Batcave, Batetcetera). Batman returns to Gotham from his training to face his first nemesis...Scarecrow.<br /><br />Batman Begins is suspenseful, scary at times and well acted with terrific special effects. An improvement even on Burton's Batman and Schumacher's Batman was a disgrace in my opinion. So Batman Begins was a delightful breath of fresh air filling the sails of what hopefully is the beginning of a new era of Batman movies.<br /><br />Go for that Buy button.
B000AA305M|5.0|I have made this CD a stocking stuffer for many of my friends!  Great Sound.  Great Lyrics.  I heard one of the tracks on NPR and went to Amazon to hear the rest and was not disappointed!
0307276902|5.0|This book is very easy to read and hard to put down.  It is a very riveting story.
0060776579|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this valuable CD. It's content is wonderful and upbeat, and gives great information. The author is the narator, and is very interesting. Great for anyone to build their wealth skills.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|FINALLY Warner Bros have released this classic the way it should have been done in the first place for a DVD. I was appauled to find the previous DVD had no bonus features what so ever and wasnt even in surround sound or wide screen.<br /><br />At long last we have the special edition. The movie didnt look all that much touched up, but it does look a bit better. The 5.1 sound is ok, tho, it's not fully 5.1 surround sound.<br /><br />Disc 1 also features a commentary track with Tim Burton... tho, it put me to sleep, so I cant tell you if it was interesting enough to listen to or not.<br /><br />Disc 2 has a bunch of stuff thats in some ways a bit disapointing, and yet other bits are interesting. The first thing is a HISTOY OF THE DARK KNIGHT feature, it goes for about 30 mins and shows the history and changed Batman has had over the the last 60 years. Starting from the origons with Bob Kane and showing the development of it all over the years up to the Cartoon series of the 90's.<br /><br />There is unfortunalty not very much of any behind the scenes of the movie. The Feturette showed more of Bob Kane talking about the movie then actualy showing the movie. There is also some bits and peices of the development team making the Batmobile, Batsuit and a bunch of things like that.<br /><br />What disapointed me is there is no deleted scenes. HOWEVER, there is a very interesting thing that shows the story board of a scene that did not get filmed, but intended to have a suprise glimpse of the boy wonder!!!!<br /><br />There is a few more things, but overall, i may be a bit disapointed with the features, which makes me wonder if this is just the Special Edition that is going to be replaced with a 3 disc Ultimate edition in 6 months.<br /><br />Still, over all, its about bloody time they released this propperlly, the way it shoudl have been done years ago.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|This is a great movie in a horrible DVD. You can get a hint just by looking at the ugly box. Why not keep the original poster art like the Rockstar videogame did? When you pop in the DVD it doesn't get any better. Prepare to be annoyed by several commercials you can't skip. <br /> <br />Then the movie begins, What is this? The comic book transitions in this cut is the worst idea to ruin an already-tight movie since \\"Greedo shoots first\\". The weak extras are not enough to fix this mistake of a director's cut. They blew it. I hope they try it again with a DVD worthy of this film.
B000AP04L0|5.0|This movie is like a time capsule from before the fall in the garden of Eden--I mean, a movie about software engineers, set in 1999--and the words \\"IPO\\", \\"World Wide Web\\", \\"Start-up\\", or \\"DOT-COM\\" are never spoken?  **sigh** simpler, happier days, because neither are the words \\"stock-market crash\\", \\"bubble\\", \\"9-11\\", or \\"terrorism\\" uttered.  Nothing here disturbs the serienity of our hero, and his quest to do absolutely nothing, in the hopes that it wiil be everything he thought it would be..... <br /> <br />Watching this movie, about engineers in their mid-20's, brings back so many memories  of how it was for me being an engineer in my mid-20's, trying my best to adapt myself to corporate lifestyle, clumsily chasing women, and trying desperatly to enjoy the last shreds of my fast-fading youth.  <br /> <br />There are so many priceless scenes in this movie--Ron Livingston is on a date with Jenifer Anniston, when she askes him the dreaded question \\"what do you do for a living?\\"  What software engineer can't help but cringe along with our hero?  Just exactly how are software engineers supposed to answer that question?  Heck, our bosses can't even comprehend what we're doing.  Any attempt to explain will inevitably make us appear geeky and then boring, but we can't just lie,  can we? <br /> <br />On the topic of lying--my wife (who works in P.R.) claims that engineers are incapable of lying--and  that is what is holding them back :-)  This movie of course has to document the inevitable doom which falls upon our hero when he boldly tries to lie like no engineer has lied before... <br /> <br />But the best metaphor of the movie, IMHO, is poor Milton, who, at a corporate birthday party for the boss,  has to keep passing along slices of birthday cake to everybody else--the cake, symbolising the rewards gotten from submitting yourself to corporate life--the cake passing right under his nose.  He can see it--he can almost taste it--and he has earned it, by submitted to the endless humilliations, both large and small, of corporate life.  But the cake keeps going, going, right under his nose, passing him by, untill its all gone.   Just like my lousy stock options. <br /> <br />Buck up, Milton's of the world!  Corporate birthday cake tastes as lousy as sour grapes, anyways :-)
B0000648WZ|4.0|If I could, I would give it 3.8 stars, but if I had to choose, I'll go with 4 stars.  ST is a good, brainless action movie that has very little to do with the novel it's based on.   <br /> <br />Just in terms of entertainment, and watching a lot of action, it's pretty good, but logically there are some things that don't make any sense.  The first thing that jumped into my mind when they invaded Klendathu (the bug's home planet), is why didn't they bombard the planet from space?  Or at least carpet bomb it with atmosphere craft like they did on Planet P.  The infantry didn't exactly have any complicated objectives like forcing the enemy to surrender or capture certain areas, and hold them.  They just went down to kill bugs on the planet's surface.  Now it's true in the novel, it explains that plastering the surface with nukes wouldn't have neutralized Klendathu because they wouldn't have done anything to the royalty caste underground, but their objectives were different.  They were to occupy the capital and key points of their home planet, bring the enemy to their knees and end the war. <br /> <br />Another thing that doesn't make sense is the infantry themselves.  Unlike the novel, the infantry has no Powered Armor what so ever.  This makes the \\"mobile infantry\\" a lot like regular infantry.  Except worse.  They have no tank support (which would have been a big help with it's thick armor to protect from arachnid claws), no artillery support, no squad based automatic weapons, no air support, no naval support (from orbital or naval ships), no field medics, no armored carriers, nothing.  Their so called armor, is effectively useless, and they use bullet based rifles.  It looked like it took 100 rounds just to take down one arachnid.  What the?  Why use an obsolete, and ineffective weapon against an enemy that's obviously resistant to it? <br /> <br />Also their battle tactics are absurd.  They just run at the enemy as a mass horde (knowing full well the arachnids can'thurt them unless they are at point blank range).  There's no fireing lines (didn't they learn anything from the zulu wars?), no one kneeled to increase their aim, no one tried to take cover, etc, etc.  I guess all that training in boot camp was to learn how to fight like a girl?  Oh right, they use football tactics in combat.  Three 6 loop hole!  Or whatever the hell it's called. <br /> <br />Anyway, I could go on to mention how useless their navy was, but this review is turning into a wall of text.  Bottom line, good action, but don't expect anything logical.
B0001EKZOQ|4.0|Bebo is such an amazing player. The music of these old-skool love songs in his hands has an unmatched mix of flavor, delicacy, and humor. <br />I love Bebo and his Cuban-style Latin sort-a jazz. And I love flamenco. Now, it took me a little while to get accustomed to the blend of these two genres. <br />It works in the end. <br />If you like El Cigala's work, then you might have an easier time with it. <br />Don't get me wrong though. The CD is good. I listen to it very often. It's not flawless, however.
B00005JNTX|3.0|Okay all of you comic book lovers out there, let's look at this film for a minute. And I don't mean check out the nice hooters on this gal or that, or watch neon-yellow blood spurt from a man's ...uh ...private area as they're ripped off. I mean LOOK at the film.<br /><br />I love to watch action in films as much as the next gruesome guy. I enjoyed the new release of SERENITY in theaters. And I thought PULP FICTION and KILL BILL were pretty darn good films, too. But they had a POINT!<br /><br />What was the plot of SIN CITY? Can anyone tell me? What was the purpose behind all this bloodshed?<br /><br />For me, there has to be action and reactions to bloodletting, not just violence for the sake of violence.<br /><br />I will say that it was engaging to watch the black and white sceenshots mix with bright colors, but that's just visuals. There HAS to be more.<br /><br />Now I'm not a tree-huggin', peace-marching, free-lover, but if you want to see part of what's wrong with our culture of violence, check out this film. It has sex, violence during sex, disembowling procedures, disembowling during sexy scenes, and ...oh yeah, more violence.<br /><br />Holy bashed-in brains, Batman!

B00004TWSX|5.0|While progressive rockers may have been the first to provide significant injections of bombast into rock music, Queen raised bombast to a fine art, and created one of the greatest rock albums in the process of doing so. Though there is bombast, there is beauty too, and Queen proved that a rock album could incorporate a huge diversity of styles and be successful. This album is a critical component of any rock music collection.<br /><br />The album opens with the first of three rockers, \\"Death on Two Legs.\\" This song has excellent metal poetry that eschews mumbled and garbled lyrics for clarity and evocation. The words contain gems from beginning to end, such as the line \\"you're a sewer-rate decaying in a cesspool of pride.\\" Guitars scream and wail and Queen's harmonies are sprinkled liberally throughout. Yet this song retains an element of fun and retains a twinkle in its musical eye. The other heavy rocker is an ode to muscle cars. \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" is a perfect cruising song with crunchy guitars and Roger Taylor's roaring vocal. The two songs are different, but anchor one end of Queen's musical range. Also included is a 1991 remix of this song. There are a few differences between the songs, but I still prefer the original. The third rocker is \\"Sweet Lady.\\" This third song is loud and fast paced, but seems less inspired than much of the music on this album.<br /><br />After \\"Death on Two Legs\\" is the first of three songs that are quirky, fun and kind of clear the aural palate between songs. \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\\" is an ode to the era of flappers and speakeasies. \\"Seaside Rendezvous\\" is in a similar vein, and also comes after a rocker. Roger Taylor and Freddie Mercury both do vocal interpretations of instruments that are remarkably effective and fun. The third song in this vein is \\"Good Company,\\" which comes after \\"Love of My Life.\\" This song has lead vocals by Brian May, along with a ukulele. This song has a musical style more similar to songs of the 1930s, though with sufficient electronic effects to remind you that the song is influenced by that era but could only have been made in this era. For reasons I am unable to explain this song is a perfect lead-in to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\"<br /><br />\\"You're My Best Friend\\" and \\"Love of My Life\\" are two love ballads that show yet another capability of Queen. \\"You're My Best Friend\\" was released as a single backed by the interesting song \\"'39\\" and reached #16 on the pop singles chart. Freddie Mercury's vocals provide the emotional kick for this song, and make this song one of Queen's best. \\"Love of My Life\\" falls into a similar vein, and features Brian May playing the harp. This song is also beautiful and emotional, and in many ways is more powerful than \\"Love of My Life.\\" In retrospect, I think this song could have been released as a single and would have done well. This version of the CD includes a 1991 remix of \\"You're My Best Friend.\\" I am unable to discern any significant difference between the two versions, and thus the addition is of minimal value.<br /><br />There is one song that is hard to categorize. \\"God Save the Queen\\" is Brian May's interpretation of the English anthem. Guitars predominate in this brief piece that is intended to be a thank you to Queen and country.<br /><br />Though the remaining three songs are quite different from each other, they share a commonality in that they are among the more experimental tracks on this CD, and being a fan of progressive rock, I think they are among the best tracks on this CD.<br /><br />The first of these songs is \\"'39.\\" I have seen many interpretations of this song that combines a flavor of country-rock with several other styles. I saw one review compare the style to Paul McCartney, and I see the relationship. I could also see a comparison to the Eagle's Joe Walsh years. The harmonies also remind me just a little of the Moody Blues.<br /><br />The next song in this category is \\"The Prophet's Song,\\" an 8:21 progressive rock masterpiece. Brian May uses a toy koto, an unusual instrument that lends a slight Asian flavor to the introduction. This song also features an a capella vocal by Freddie Mercury that is fascinating and adds to the numerous dimensions of this song that features a rocking end.<br /><br />The third song is the bombastic art rock classic \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" This phenomenal song can be treated as a parody of glam rock, or it can be considered in the context of a rock group that was unafraid of performing their art as they saw fit. The pseudo operatic elements are wonderful and occasionally eerie and always fascinating. The harmonies are outstanding and wonderfully excessive. If ever a song captured everything good about rock music, this one is it. This song charted the first time in 1976 and reached #9. The second time the song charted was in 1992, when it reached #2. You will have some kind of feeling about this song regardless of whether that reaction is one of awe or distaste, but those us who are fans of Queen and progressive rock usually love this one.<br /><br />Queen hit pay dirt with this album, which reached #4 on the Pop Albums chart. This album was easily Queen's best album, showcasing the talents of four individuals who were able to able to come together and stay together until Freddie Mercury passed away. While Queen had many excellent songs, they had at least one great album, and this was it.<br /><br />Note that this is the gold version of this album and there are several others available.  Choose wisely!ong,\\" an 8:21 progressive rock masterpiece. Brian May uses a toy koto, an unusual instrument that lends a slight Asian flavor to the introduction.

B000001GY9|1.0|Revised 6/5/12<br />(For those of you in a hurry, the essentials of this review are in the 3rd paragraph.)<br /><br />Bernstein as a musician was very sympathetic to the theatre and to music containing extroverted displays of emotion - music of which a listener could immediately grasp the emotional significance or message no matter how bombastic or subtle it may be at a given moment. Despite his numerous liberties with the details of the score, especially with tempo, it's hard to deny that on an emotional level, Bernstein fundamentally understood the music of Tchaikovsky, Mahler, and other composers of this particular vein more than most other conductors. He always sought to take a composer's personal statement and fuse it with his own personal statement on an emotional level, resulting in very unique interpretations of the standard repertoire.<br /><br />Schumann's music, on the other hand, contains very little theatre. His output consists mostly of piano music, lieder, and chamber music - all small-scale works. His large dramatic works (such as his oratorios or his opera Genoveva) are performed much less often and are considered by many to be less convincing musically. Schumann was, above all, a poet. He was either setting someone else's poetry to music, or composing it himself. His expression is always spontaneous and flowing, sometimes explosive, and often obsessive and neurotic. There is always kinetic energy, and a variance of tone color that sometimes rivals Debussy. But unlike in the music of those mentioned in the first paragraph, Schumann did not put his emotions on display for the world to see. Yes, his music was very personal, and sometimes even autobiographical. But there is a certain amount of dignity and composure that Tchaikovsky, Mahler, and even Berlioz sacrifice in order to achieve their musical goals. The composers in Schumann's lineage, from Haydn to Brahms, always manage to retain their composure. The music never becomes about life and death. We always notice the craft, but the emotional content is harder to tease out.<br /><br />So what's my point? Perhaps owing to the reasons above, Bernstein is unsympathetic to Schumann's music in these performances. He fails to capture Schumann's inner spark; he fails to capture the sense of spontaneity (this is particularly elusive for many conductors); and he fails to capture the ebb and flow of the poetry. I get the sense that he is trying instead to extract something emotional from this music that just isn't there. He's probing for this life-and-death significance and never finds it. Failing that, he just paints over the music with whatever suits him best in the moment. We can experience the duality of Bernstein's emotional relationship with a composer only if he gets the composer's side of the argument right first. Otherwise, we only experience Bernstein, and that's the case here. Schumann never shows up. We see the usual outrageously stretched out tempi and Mahlerian articulation of form, but there's nothing fundamental here to back it up.<br /><br />Schumann's music requires enough speed to maintain the forward motion, especially in slow movements. This is where Bernstein's excesses are just too much for me. Time stands irritatingly still. If one were to follow Schumann's metronome markings for the 2nd symphony, the 3rd movement would be over in about 7 minutes. Bernstein takes almost 14. The 3rd movement of the Rhenish symphony lazes around in a slow 8 pattern. Bernstein micro-manages every detail, and the phrasing is sickeningly precious.<br /><br />Schumann's music also requires a light enough touch to bring the colors into focus. The Vienna Philharmonic is at the top of their game, but their ensemble is enormous and so is their expression. It's heavy and typical of large Austro-Germanic orchestras. They are taking symphonies conceived of as expanded chamber works and stuffing them with old-fashioned Wagnerian clichés. It doesn't work with Schubert, so howcould it possibly work here? Granted, the results don't ooze as they do in Karajan's recordings, but Bernstein's misdirected sentimentality adds a comparably damaging layer to the mix. At least the balance between the winds and the strings is good (Vienna usually doubles their woodwinds), and I can't fault the orchestra for not caring. They play their hearts out. This is their music and their culture, after all.<br /><br />There are two prevailing extremes regarding Schumann interpretation. The traditional approach is similar to this one: a big modern orchestra with broad articulation and slow tempi (albeit a little less extreme). The other extreme involves period instruments (gut strings, natural brass) with little to no vibrato, light articulation, and moderate to fast tempi. I'm more partial to the latter, but it's never completely satisfying. Both of these approaches often seem non-committal at different points in the music. I would love to see more ensembles willing to meet in the middle - experimenting with different ensemble sizes, different shades of vibrato (rather than a lot all the time or none at all), mixtures of old and new instruments, and a complete rethinking of the way Schumann's music is phrased from bar to bar, taking into account his marked tempi, rather than the standard sluggish tempi we're so used to hearing.

0393317552|5.0|In this single volume, Jared Diamond, professor of physiology and geography at UCLA, attempts to outline history's broadest pattern.  He takes as his subject matter everything that has happened on all continents for the last 13,000 years.  In 11,000 BC, at the end of the last Ice Age, all societies were on equal footing, existing as bands of preliterate hunter-gatherers.  Yet by 1532 AD the Spanish conquistador Pizarro with 169 men was able to travel across thousands of miles of ocean and conquer the Incas at Cajamarca in spite of being vastly outnumbered.  The poximate causes were guns, germs, and steel.  However, this book is more concerned with ultimate causes, that is to say, broader patterns.  Diamond finds the answer in geography and environmental endowment.<br /><br />The title is a little perplexing since the thesis that Diamond is setting forth does not explain proximate causes, it deals with more remote causation.  For example, it explains why Europe was the most wealthy and powerful continent in 1500, but it doesn't  explain why it was the Spanish that conquered the Incas or the Aztecs for that matter, or why, for example, Great Britain was the most powerful European country in 1850.<br /><br />Diamond tells us that the key to understanding human history is food production.  The parts of the world that were endowed with a wide variety of domesticable plants and animals and a geography favorable to their migration and diffusion had clear advantages over other societies.  There were some excellent chapters in this book on the origins of agriculture.  He describes all the benefits of the domestication of large animals and their living in close proximity with human beings.  This happened extensively in Europe and China, providing these populations with immunities to various diseases over the course of centuries.  Agriculture led to more complex stratified societies with central government, writing, iron tools, standing armies, etc.  It was for this reason - food production - that the world's most wealthy and powerful societies originated on the Eurasian continent.<br /><br />Diamond flatly rejects the notion that some societies were either culturally or racially superior.  Some critics have simply called this political correctness, while others claim he is merely reinforcing Eurocentrism by claiming it was geographically inevitable.  True, Diamond argues that any cultural or technological advantage was rooted in geography and environmental richness.  But within the parameters of that determinism, historical actors still have considerable room to fail or succeed.  Europeans have been ascendent for the last 500 hundred years; this does not mean that there position is somehow guaranteed.  In the last twenty years there has been an enormous transfer of wealth, technology, and power to China and India, it appears they may soon achieve great power status.<br /><br />Most historians do not work on the scale that Diamond does. Instead of continents and millenium, they choose narrower geographic areas with much shorter time frames.  Most historians also, from a much more proximate point of view, see history in terms of human ideas and conscious human actions, rather than a series of responses to the environment.  Diamond has neglected, for example, to explain the emergence of modern science and its impact on societies.  He also neglects to explain the impact of relgion, other than as a mere handmaiden of the state. In his attempt to achieve a grand theory of history he ulitimately fails - as all those before him have.<br /><br />Nevertheless , this is a monumental work of learning  and originality, worthy of the Pulitzer Prize that it received.  It is disingenuous for some reviewers to dismiss it as simply a theory of geographical determinism.  It is much more, it spans a wide range of disciplines and it goes a long way in explaining the distribution of wealth and power among societies for the last 13,000 years.- food production - that the world's most wealthy and powerful societies originated on the Eurasian continent. <br /> <br />Diamond flatly rejects the notion that some societies were either culturally or racially superior.

1580086810|5.0|Peter Menzel and Faith D'Aluisio have done it again! As a true fan of all their books, I have savoured every page of the beautiful photography and the insightful descriptions in this book. Just like I did with Material World and Women in the Material World, I have read \\"Hungry Planet\\"  in one sitting. <br />  <br />Faith's writing makes you feel like you really got to know the families and manages to give us the essence of their lives in a few pages. Pete's pictures make you feel like you went along on the trip with them. I specially liked the recipes for the different foods that are included in the book as well as Peter's field notes which are most revealing and make the book all the more intimate.  <br />  <br />What I find most amazing is that our four children (ages 19 through 11) have been fascinated by the book just as much as by the Material World book. I think the format is very appealing to young readers because it is full of tidbits of information that let's us compare our own food choices to those of the rest of the world. <br />If we could all come away with just one lesson learned from this book, it would be \\"hara hachi bu\\", like the Okinawans say, \\"eat until you are 80% full\\".  <br />  <br />Hungry Planet is an informative and entertaining book, it will make for a good gift for everyone in your Christmas list!

0060934913|1.0|I picked up a copy Kitchen Confidential after reading several rave reviews from both the press and fellow readers.  I was fortunate enough to have been raised in the restaurant business--my family owns a very successful steakhouse (average of about 600 meals on a Saturday night) in the midwest.  I was somewhat familiar with Bourdain from FoodTV and was very excited to read about his stories as being a chef in NYC.  Business is obviously a lot different between New York and rural America and I had often wondered what working in a restaurant with top notch famous chefs would be like.  I'm also somewhat smitten with Rocco DiSpirito so I was excited to read about the \\"rockstar\\" life Bourdain cited in a press release about his book. <br /> <br />The first few chapters described his childhood and early years of working in the food industry.  I'll admit they were rather entertaining.  Irritation and boredom kicked in soon after.  Bourdain's biggest problem is his lack of writing talent.  The poor grammar, lack of flow, lack of focus, and incredibly over use of cliches were rather endearing for the first 30 or 40 pages.  Knowing that he is a chef by profession, not a writer, his lack of honed writing skill was different.  Upon getting deepr in the text, however, it became boring, redundant, irritating, and just down right annoying.  What bothered me most was the lack of focus.  For several chapters he bounced around a lot when describing different periods of his life and the jobs he was working.  It was incredibly confusing to keep track of his age, where he worked, what he did.  What Bourdain really needs a good editor to help him get his thoughts together. <br /> <br />The actual content was lacking as well.  I didn't find anything he wrote about scandalous, let alone make me never want to set foot in a restaurant again.  The life he tried to describe mentions that he used drugs, but he didn't really give the reader any type of understanding as to how it affected him, orwho he met, what he did, or any other crazy stories that makes him stand out from any other person in the 80s or 90s hooked on heroine or coke.  Nothing he presented made me think of anything close to the life of a crazy rockstar.  I'd imagine he did experience those things, he just doesn't actually tell you about them.  There are very few comments referring to things that would make you think twice about eatting at a restaurant, and all of these are common sense when you actually think about them. <br /> <br />I'd have a hard time recommending that people should waste their time by reading this book.  The only exception I can think of are people who are aspiring to be a professional chef.  Bourdain does do a good job of how physically, mentally, personally, and emotionally draining it is to be a chef.   <br /> <br />In summary, stay away from this book if you are looking for entertainment, tips on what to eat a restaurant, or any type of dirty fun.  It's not here.  But, if you are considering to be a chef in a major city make sure you pick this up to make sure this is what you want to do.

However, I suppose if you have never experienced true love or never had any experiences of life, I can see how it would be difficult to udnerstand. A young 22 year old woman friend read this book the same week I did. And though she enjoyed it, she could not relate to the intimacy, the artfulness, the soulfullness of the love between Robert and Francesca. I told her to reread again in twenty years and she might have a better understanding depending on her life's experiences. I thought the writing was excellent compared to a great number of books out there, such as Nicholas Sparks, who's stories are entertaining, but to me writes on a 8th grade level. If you are a true romantic, prose writing, and believe in true love, this is a must read for you. [...]
B000084T18|3.0|If you had asked me 2 years ago, what i thought of this album, I would have told you it was the best thing since sliced bread and 50 was a genius, how my opinion has changed in that time.  I was just getting into hip-hop back then, and i played this over and over (mainly for the beats), as i got into rap music more though i started to buy a load of classic albums by the likes of Tupac, NWA, Dre, Snoop, Nas, Jay-Z etc...  Skip to the year 2005, and The Massacre is released, I heard so many bad reviews of it so i thought i'd download it first to check it out, a wise decision.  I feared the worst after hearing the first two singles and I was right it was absolute c**p (see more in my massacre review).  It got me thinking, can Get Rich Or Die Tryin have been by the same person, I went back and listened to it again (listening to the lyrics as well now) and realised it was also pretty c**p.  O.K thats a little harsh, but it was nowhere near as good as i had remembered it, sure In Da Club still bangs when they play it in the club, as does P.I.M.P, but lyrically it has nothing of substance at all.  The beats are all that hold this album together, and they are good, but the further 50 moves away from Dre and Eminem I can see things getting even worse, and when the beats are gone, what do you have left?  The answer is nothing.  I give this album 2 1/2 stars for the beats alone and 1/2 star for 50's lyrics, which is generous, just take a listen fanboys.
B0002858YS|3.0|Here's a breakdown of the songs:    Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine-  I don't really dig songs with people's names in them but this is passable.  4/5    Mr. Brightside-  The second single from the band and the story of my life. I really like it but the synthesizers can get annoying.  4/5    Smile Like You Mean It-  Lyrically, one of the best songs on the album. The message is a bit sad.  5/5    Somebody Told Me-  I never felt for this one much. Kinda boring except for the ending parts.  3/5    All These Things That I've Done -  Good song, bad choice to make it a single. There's a gospel choir in the background that's totally awesome.  4/5    Andy, You're A Star-  Never liked it. Pretty lame.  1/5    On Top-  Reminds me of the eighties. The synths really rock out on this one (can synths rock out?) The chorus is a hook.  5/5    Change Your Mind-  Again, I've failed to play this song more than once.  1/5    Believe Me Natalie-  Love it. Great vocals.  5/5    Midnight Show-  Um...  1/5    Everything Will Be Alright-  Perfect close to an album. Slow and soothing.  5/5
B000001E18|4.0|When I fist bought Zooropa over 10 years ago now, I thought that this album sucked.  I guess that's the mind set of an immature kid fresh out of high school, with little appreciation for things that are different.  I had been used to the U2 of old, like War, The Joshua Tree, The Unforgettable Fire, and their masterpiece, Achtung Baby.  On Zooropa, it seems like they took innovations that they had first discovered on Achtung and stretched them further.  The electronic music was evolving, and this was showcased in songs like the title track, Babyface, Lemon, and Numb.  However, the two best songs on the album, I feel, are Stay and Dirty Day.  To me, these songs are closer to some of their older work, and give a sense of completeness to the entire album.Overall, they've done better, and they've done worse.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Green Day is sooo kewl. Period. With such moving songs like Boulevard of Broken Records and the megarock of American Retard, I can see why they rule! They rock so hard I might need a Holiday!  Forget it. Green Day sucks worse than Simple Plan and Good Charlotte's nursing baby. And that, my friends, is a whole lot of sucking.
B000089CJI|5.0|This may be one of the best albums that I have ever purchased and listened to.  I got into The Postal Service because of having listened to Death Cab For Cutie and loving their music.  The Postal  Service is no red-headed step child to them.  It is music that for the most part is upbeat and energetic.  Combine that with Ben Gibbard's excellent lyricism and vocals, and you have an album that will take your breath away.  Favorites of mine include The District Sleeps Alone Tonight, Sleeping In, and We Will Become Sillouettes.  If you haven't heard this recording, do so at once.
B00009V7T2|5.0|i noticed that most of these reviews are written by guys, but trust me when i say that as a woman, i think the is the most intense, thoughtful, and tastiest ear candy i have ever heard. <br /> <br />it's an addiction. you won't be able to stop listening to it. tracks 6 and 9 are these fantastic trips in some other world that leave you stranded with the memories of whatever you were doing when you first heard them. <br /> <br />the harmonies are delicious, the guitar reminiscent of carlos santana in places. the ambient sounds are dark and watery and the lyrics complex and strange. <br /> <br />remember that this body of work is intended to tell a story from start to finish. read the lyrics and complete the journey started by the mars volta.
B000002KD9|5.0|This is the first album I purchased from Neil Young. Its a great way to start off a collection of him. Young and Bowie are my favorite solo artists. After The Gold Rush is pure classic material, \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" is very nice and touching. \\"Southern Man\\" is huge man, great classic song. \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\" was the song that sold me on Neil Young, there is a cover of it on American Beauty in the scene where Kevin Spacey and Mena Suvari start to get a little busy. Fantastic song, short and sweet and very touching. Phenominal classic folk/country rock here for sure I promise. Neil Youngs voice is kinda rusty too, great for his grungy classic rock sound, his voice is quite unique and cool and I like it. So, make way for the Cripple Creek Ferry. Neil Young is a guitar master(Especially on Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere) and a great musician!

B000B2YQX4|2.0|Stop! This short review is not about the merits of the new album, it's about the mastering job done by the producers. It's awful. The original recordings, which were probably quite good, have had all traces of impact, dynamic range, 3-dimensional space, etc. SMASHED out of them by the unbelievably heavy use of digital compressors and limiters.<br /><br />I'm of the opinion that this was not the wish of the band, but a corporate decision made in the boardroom by the suits. It's amazing to me that one of the touted benefits of the CD Audio format, way back in the mid 80s, was excellent dynamic range. Don't tell the guy who mastered Playing the Angel. There is virtually no dynamic range present at all.<br /><br />Don't believe me? Can't trust your ears? If you did purchase this CD or can borrow a friend's, you might bring it up in any wav editor or analyzer. You'll notice each song looks like a solid band, completely flat. There are no ups and downs whatsoever. Now compare that to virtually anything from DM's past releases, and you'll see the volume isn't as high overall, but there's vastly more variation in volume, and you can actually see the beats and the impact of the sounds.<br /><br />Depeche Mode is a casualty of the current max volume arms race. Yep, it's \\"loud,\\" but when the WHOLE THING is loud, when a drum (for instance) is not any louder than anything else, said drum loses all impact. When everything is as loud as everything else, there's no sense of space in the recording at all. This CD was mastered to get as close as digitally possible to the max loudness for the redbook audio (16 bit CD) standard at all times. And in fact at many many points it tries to go \\"over,\\" which means there's digital clipping of the signal. This is not good distortion (like synth-created distortion or guitar amp distortion or even analog clipping), kids, this is ugly.<br /><br />This is all particularly disturbing because in the past DM has had some beautifully recorded and mastered music. If your sound-producing devices are the stock ipod earbuds, or your $30 PC speakers, or the stereo in your noisy car, then this CD was made for you. If you have any sort of decent or hi-fi headphones/canalphones or speaker system, then you'll probably notice something just isn't right with this CD. Remember back to my review, and then think about how thin and one-dimensional things sound. I was very much looking forward to this CD, but I listen to music like this on nice equipment, and the poor sound is a hard pill to swallow. Somewhere under the oppressive compression is a gorgeous recording trying to claw its way out.<br /><br />EDIT: two more points. I posted this elsewhere and people had some misconceptions. First, the compression I'm talking about has absolutely nothing to do with data compression as accomplished in conversion to MP3s. Completely different concepts.<br /><br />Second, a lack of dynamic range due to poor mastering doesn't necessarily mean the production is slick, or dirty, or old or new. There are plenty of 60s and 70s recordings that are somewhat rudimentary as far as mic technology and recording techniques that nonetheless have a very good dynamic range. There are plenty of modern examples of very slick production that also preserves dynamic range, and modern \\"lo fi\\" recordings that have poor dynamic range.<br /><br />It also doesn't mean much about the sounds the band made in putting their vision to tape. It can be the cleanest electronica, the gentlest acoustic folk, the purest classical female vocals, the grungiest indie rock, the hardest speed metal, or the twangiest Texas country. Dynamic range, or the deliberate destroying thereof, is a constant across virtually any type of music. In short, I'm in no way disparaging what DM did creatively or what they WANTED it to sound like, just the final delivery of that vision.<br /><br />Maybe the SACD/DVD-A versions are better.ducing devices are the stock ipod earbuds, or your $30 PC speakers, or the stereo in your noisy car, then this CD was made for you.

B000AU1NYW|5.0|Well, DM's 11th studio album: \\"Playing The Angel\\", is out, and as always, there's much debate amongst the fans on how it measures up.  It's an album that definitely requires multiple listens to truly appreciate what it has to offer.  Dave Gahan gets his first crack at writing for a depeche mode album and, now having Paper Monsters under his belt, doesn't waste the opportunity, with \\"Suffer Well\\" (gotta love that guitar riff) & \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" being two of the best songs on the album.  He's never sounded better.  Martin Gore's \\"Precious\\" is a standout song all its own (and is the first from the album to obtain single status).  No doubt one of the most private and personal songs of his career, dealing with his own divorce and having to handle how it affects his children.   <br /> <br /> <br />\\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" is the opening song that grabs your attention, at first, with a loud noise (like was done with \\"I Feel You\\" or, yes, \\"The Dead Of Night\\").  It really prepares you for what lies in store, with it's very bleak and moody electronic broodery, that has a nice beat to it.  \\"John The Revelator\\" & \\"The Sinner In Me\\" are the two most religiously referenced tracks on the album (\\"JTR\\" is also very danceable too).  It's interesting how Martin perceives religion in his songs, considering he himself has never admitted to being very religious.  \\"TSIM\\" also contains another guitar riff by Martin towards the end of the song, that sounds a bit erratic in certain spots, but is still quite cool and very catchy.   <br /> <br /> <br />Like just about every DM album since Some Great Reward (save Black Celebration), Martin takes on lead vocals for two songs for this album: \\"Macro\\" & \\"Damaged People\\".  \\"Macro\\" is a twangy tune with some interesting lyrics, but \\"Damaged People\\" is more of a standout between the two, with it's rather playful opening.  I could swear that the chorus of the song reminded me a little of a song Erasure did back in the 90's, ironically titled: \\"Home\\".  They may have used similar instrumentation.   <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Lillian\\" is a fast moving song about a fast, seductive, and manipulative femme fatale, that really revs up the rather slower moving second half of the album.  Dave's wonderful way of singing seductively about being abused and manipulated by the fairer sex gives off this S&M feeling that you can't help deny is there.  DM have always been so good with this kind of subject matter, and they probably always will.  <br /> <br /> <br />\\"The Darkest Star\\" at nearly 7 minutes, initially ends the album <br />with it's slow melody (and some very nice singing by Dave).  The problem is that it's too slow for its own good and not the sort of way one would like a Depeche Mode album to end...slowly.  Thankfully, the Japanese CD Edition of \\"Playing The Angel\\" includes a track that many feel should've been on the album to begin with: \\"Free\\".  This is a great track.  A GREAT TRACK!  Having it included as the final song on the CD gives \\"Playing The Angel\\" exactly what it needed, a fast moving, grandiose ending, with Dave hitting every move and groove, lyrically and physically, giving the listener the icing on the cake they so desperately desired.  It may be pricey, but if you feel the same, I highly recommend you seek this Japanese CD Edition out to have \\"Free\\" officially included on this wonderful album.  You will not regret it. <br /> <br />The anger, the angst, the melancholy is all here.  \\"Playing The Angel\\" shows DM pulling out all the stops and doing what they do best: making cutting edge, state of the art, electronic music.  Again, grab up the Japan CD so you can have \\"Free\\" ending the album.  It really makes a huge difference and will not disappoint.  Here's to the continued success to the boys from Basildon.   <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Playing The Angel\\" - \\"Pain And Suffering In Various Tempos\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Stay Devoted!
B0007OASII|5.0|THE BAND: Roy S. Khan (vocals), Thomas Youngblood (guitar), Glenn Barry (bass), Casey Grillo (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: Released in 2005. Recorded at Gate Studios in Wolfsburg, Germany. 14 tracks clocking in at approximately 54 minutes. An 18-page booklet with band photos and lyrics are included.<br /><br />COMMENTS: How did I miss this band? This is/was my first experience with the European power metal outfit named Kamelot. I have a few of Khan's older discs with Conception, but lost track of him after they disbanded. Through other reviewers here on Amazon, I learned about Khan's Kamelot. Majestic, dark, moody, melodic, hard, soft, beautiful... all of it - if you're looking for some progressive power metal, look no further. I immediately went back and bought several other releases from Kamelot (the best of the rest being \\"Epica\\" and \\"Karma\\"), but \\"The Black Halo\\" is my still my favorite. The 8+ minute \\"Momento Mori\\", the amazing title track, \\"Moonlight\\" and \\"The Haunting\\" are songs I keep repeating over and over again. Like the previous album, I love the use of brief interludes between some of the songs (\\"Black Halo\\" has 3 of them) to break things up a bit. The use of orchestra strings really pulls everything together. The lyrics can't help but creat an epic story while you listen. Kamelot is beyond comparison. Listen to the sound clips here on Amazon to get a quick flavor, but by no means judge them on these short snippets. Kamelot is served best with a complete and uninterrupted listen. One of my favorite music purchases from 2005. Great disc.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|After much hype and pre release promotions, this long awaited album finds Robbie right on form. More mature, his honest and heart felt lyrics find a new depth,(his usual tongue in cheek honesty creeping in in places) Musically different enough to be interesting but still a real Robbie classic! A touch of Lou Reed perhaps in \\"Spread your wings\\"?, rock and roll, ballards,(one dedicated to Elvis) and a touch of electric with more variation and range on vocals than previous albums. A good partnership with Stephen Duffy has produced a brilliant album. All Robbie fans - don't hesitate, those still to be converted - go buy and try - Maybe now Robbie will be recognised for what he truely is - a brilliant songwriter and a talented inspired entertainer. Enjoy!
B00012BD0S|5.0|THE BAND: Michael Romeo (guitars), Russell Allen (vocals), Thomas Miller (bass), Jason Rullo (drums & Percussion), Mike Pinnella (keyboards).<br /><br />THE DISC: Released orginally in 1997. 9 tracks clocking in at approximately 66 minutes. Recorded at Trax East Studios in South River, NJ. The new digipak contains digitally mastered sound as well as a screen saver and band interview. There is an 18-page booklet containing band pictures, lyrics, song credits and thank you's. Label - Inside Out Music.<br /><br />COMMENTS: This was my first ever disc from this New Jersey band. It will forever hold a special place in my heart. I rank it 2nd only to the band's magnum opus \\"V-The New Mythology Suite\\"... and it isn't 2nd by much. This is a truly wonderful album. The band has since grown and matured since '97 and I truly believe they rank as one of the top heavy progressive rock music acts out there. It truly escapes me why Symphony X receives little or no air play in America, little or no promotion, and limited touring (at least in the southwest)... yet they remain Gods across the ocean in Europe and Japan. Romeo's blistering work on the guitar is high quality stuff (Yngwie Malmsteen would be proud) and he has very few equals. Russell Allen's voice is beautiful - and he's a singer, not a screamer or growler. Miller, Rullo and Pinnella are all equally talented on their instruments. The 22+ minute title track and \\"The Accolade\\" will forever be my two favorite songs that the band has ever written. If you're new to Symphony X, you must try \\"V-The New Mythology Suite\\" or \\"Twilight In Olympus\\" next. Great disc.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|It's 1996 and James Cameron's new film is in trouble. Facing titanic production set backs, on set disasters (such as food laced with PCP fed to the production crew by a disgruntled employee), Cameron's film which is relying on state-of-the-art digital effects to bring the epic story to life keeps edging over budget and running behind. The film surprisingly wins an Academy Award for Best Picture among a slew of other awards, faces a critical drubbing in the press and manages to become one of the highest grossing films of all time. When \\"Titanic\\" was first announced the two studios releasing the film 20th Century Fox and Paramount both knew that they had a monumental project that might make bucket loads of money. They also knew given Cameron's reputation as a perfectionist it wasn't going to be an easy shoot. Still with an appealing cast, epic story chronicling the sinking of the unsinkable luxury liner R.M.S. Titanic in 1912 it seemed worth the gamble. \\"Titanic\\" may have been the most expensive movie ever made up to that time (rumor varies as to the final cost of the film and Fox has been mum on the final cost) but it also became the blockbuster of the year. While this isn't quite the definitive edition fans were hoping for, it's about as close as were likely to get until the film shows up on the HD DVD format or Blu-Ray.<br />***<br />Told in flashback \\"Titanic\\" begins by chronicling the attempt of treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) trying to find the wreckage of the luxury liner. On board at the time was the stunning Hope diamond a priceless piece of jewelry that has been missing since the ship went down. As Lovett's salvage operation is televised he's contacted by a woman named Rose (Gloria Stuart) who claims to be a survivor of the disaster and also to know the whereabouts of the strand of jewelry the diamond was set in. Skeptical at first, Rose tells Brock and his crew about the journey and her shipboard romance with starving artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). The itinerant Dawson wins two tickets on the luxury liner in a card game and looks forward to returning to America after years abroad. When Dawson meets socialite Rose De Witt Bukater (Kate Winslet) his world and hers is turned upside down when they fall in love on the voyage. There are two problems; the first is Rose's wealthy fianc&eacute; Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) a man ruthless, egotistic man that will resort to violence to get what he wants and the fate of the luxury liner itself. When it was launched from England the unique design of the Titanic made it appear unsinkable but when the ship hits an iceberg that rips through the hold of the ship the travelers are in for a horrifying ordeal.<br /><br />One of the most popular DVD releases back in 1998, \\"Titanic\\" has been in need of refurbishing for some time now. Paramount has pulled out all the stops for this release when it comes to the transfer of the film to DVD. Released for the first time in anamorphic widescreen, receives a magnificent transfer here spreading the movie over two discs allowing for as much breathing space for the video and audio as possible. The image quality is exceptional with strong, bright colors and flesh tones that are accurate. The contrast is exceptional and although there is grain noticeable in the image that's to be expected since the original film itself demonstrated grain in its theatrical run. Remember, this was shot before the launch of HD video for movies. While there are some minor issues with edge enhancement they aren't noticeable on most screens and are not a distraction even on when viewed on a 61 inch widescreen TV. \\"Titanic\\" provides a visually stunning picture with a state-of-the-art transfer. While I thought this was only on my disc, it appears that there is an endocing flaw that makes a small portion of Di Caprio's face dissolve into pixelated bits on all the first pressings of this DVD.<br /><br />\\"Titanic\\" also offers a wide range of audio options as well. There's an excellent Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo soundtrack as well as an exceptional Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and stunning DTS 6.1 ES soundtrack. While the DTS soundtrack sounds slightly fuller and less clipped than the 5.1 EX soundtrack, they are very, very close in terms of quality. Keep in mind that you won't experience the full wonder of these mixes until the last section of the movie when the disaster occurs. While the format is used well in the early part of the movie most of the effects are limited to ambient sound until the disaster occurs.<br /><br />Although most of the extras are confined to the third disc there are also quite a few interesting extras on disc 1 and 2 which primarily focus on the movie itself. First, there's an interactive behind-the-scenes option that allows you to view footage from the production of the film. Most of these segments run about a minute or two and you're returned to where you were in the film after they conclude. You can also view these bits separately as well. An alternate ending for the film is provided on the second disc. As Cameron points out in his commentary track (it can be viewed without his comments as well) for the \\"alternate ending\\" it's not that at all-it's the ORIGINAL ending for the film. When Cameron was writing the script his focus was to tie together all the strands of the film much as a novelist would but, in the end, he went back and reshot the ending when he realized that it said and showed things that didn't need to be said and shown.  We also get the music video for Celine Dion's treacly radio favorite \\"My Heart Goes On\\".<br /><br />Disc 3 features the bulk of the extra material here and while it isn't quite as extensive as the 4 disc set being released in Europe, there's a vast amount of material here. We get a number of featurettes including \\"A Time Lapse Creation of the `Titanic' Set\\" with a commentary by Ed Marsh. It's fascinating to watch because even if you have been in film production the scope of the sets build is staggering.  Marsh also created a faux 1912 newsreel for the launch of the Titanic and that's included intact and, again, features commentary from Marsh. \\"Titanic Crew Video\\" features the actors and crew appearing in what's more or less a gag reel for the movie. Cameron provides commentary on the \\"Deep Dive\\" that he did in 1995 for the footage of the real Titanic. It's eerie and fascinating and Cameron's comments are pretty interesting as well. Cameron justified the shoot to Fox by pointing out that to do it in miniature would cost more and the publicity would be worth millions. We get a \\"Ship Tour\\" which Anders Falk narrates. The footage was put together for the \\"Titanic Historical Society Convention\\" done on the Queen Mary. It's as close as we'll ever discover what it felt light to walk through the actual Titanic. \\"Visual Effects\\" provides a breakdown of the shot in the engine room using both miniatures and full scale parts. \\"I'm Flying\\" demonstrates how the visual effects were done for the sequence where Rose is at the front of the ship with Jack looking over the water from the edge of the boat. It includes all the individual elements used to make up the sequence including real footage, large scale miniature and digital effects along with the full scale footage shot on a green screen stage. We get to see how the final sequence was put together as well. It's a marvelous example of how the visual effects created the illusion we see in the final footage. \\"First Class Lounge\\" was a section of the ship that was flooded. A miniature of the first class lounge was created and shot compositing elements of a green screen shot so that it looked as if the actual stage had been flooded. It's a brilliant and seamless optical. Finally \\"Titanic Sinking Simulation\\" takes us through the the various stages of completed CGI that were combined to give the sinking sequence its powerful impact.<br /><br />\\"Stills Gallery\\" includes the \\"Titanic Scriptment\\" which allowsyou to read Cameron's script. \\"Storyboard Sequences\\" is designed so you can view the entire gallery or individual sections which include everything from the \\"Southampton Departure\\" sequence to the \\"Final Sinking Sequence\\" from the film and includes nine sequences in total. \\"Production Artwork\\" includes production paintings by Tom Lay, costume design art by David Le Vey and \\"Wreck Sketches\\" done by James Cameron. \\"Photographs\\" covers the deep dive that Cameron did as well as photos from the model shop and even includes the extras' scrapbook with photos of the extras during production as well as behind-the-scenes photos of the sets. There are over 200 photos included in this section. \\"Ken Marschall's Painting Gallery\\" features material that Marschall completed for \\"Titanic: An Illustrated History\\" which was done in collaboration with writer Don Lynch. The book provided inspiration for Cameron throughout the writing and research process. These wonderfully detailed collection of 82 paintings clearly inspired Cameron's attention to detail in the film. Finally there's a text section that discusses the international performance of \\"Titanic\\" in terms of local currency and how that translates to the US gross of the film. There's even a 72 page bibliography referencing the material that Cameron used to do research and that came out as tie-ins with the movie.<br /><br />The extensive deleted scenes section includes 29 scenes with Cameron's commentary. The scenes include finished visual effects and music to allow viewers to see how the sequences might have looked if they might have been finished. Cameron chose not to reintegrate them into the film. It's pretty clear why the scenes weren't put into the movie but many still have value and will be appreciated by fans of the movie. The scenes have a \\"handle\\", i.e., the sequence that preceded the cut sequence and followed it.<br /><br />\\"Marketing\\" includes the \\"Fox Special: Breaking New Ground\\" which was produced as a promotional tie in to the movie. We also get the press kit featurettes which were originally included as part of the Electronic Press Kit (EPK). We also get a 62 page gallery of concept artwork for the posters considered for the film as well as the final ones used to promote the movie. There's also an Easter egg featuring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn (much thinner and much younger) as two dim movie executives suggesting that Cameron do a sequel. I believe this played on the \\"MTV Movie Awards\\". It's a very funny sequence and can be accessed by clicking down to the main menu and then clicking right.<br /><br />Cameron's comments cover everything the performances to production trivia and even a bit of history as well including a short discourse on women's rights. Cameron discusses the real vs. reel aspects of the story. Interestingly, Cameron comments that in the sequence where they launch the lifeboats they (meeting the actors and crew) had to figure out how they launched the real ones they were so different from what we have today. The lifeboats included in the film were manufactured by the same company that manufactured the original lifeboats for the R.M.S. Titanic. Packed with trivia and detail, Cameron's commentary track is one of the richest on the disc even though he does his solo. The passengers thought that the lifeboats and life preservers were all part of an elaborate exercise or drill based on Cameron's research. Likewise, he points out that the only person beyond the crew that would know what happened was Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber) who heroically stayed behind on the sinking ship as well as trying to organize and get people off the ship. Surprisingly, carrying a concealed fire arm was not that uncommon. There were a lot of bodies that were discovered with guns on them. Cameron also points out that no one wanted to get off the ship into the boats because the band was still playing and everyone still thought that perhaps it was a drill.<br /><br />The cast and production crew provide a second audio track. Whenever the speaker changes there is a title telling you who is speaking. Covering everything from the actor's preparation for the film (from reading books about the incident to talking with historians) to production details (producer Jon Landau provides a unique perspective since he is both a producer and a director), it's equally as fascinating as Cameron's track or the one done by the historians. While there is some duplication (how can there not be?) most of the commentary tracks have enough new information to keep each one interesting on its own. Having three commentary tracks might seem like overkill but, well, this is a James Cameron film and Cameron is known for exhaustive detail in both his research and his production of his films.<br /><br />The third audio commentary track features historians discussing the accuracy of the film and the world in 1912. It's amazing how accurate Cameron's film is. The historians point out that misinformation was rampant and stewards told people to go to bed because the ship probably just dropped a propeller blade.  Cameron was worried that the davits that lowered the lifeboats might break during the sequences when they lowered them. The concept of a major sea rescue at the time was unthinkable. If a ship went down, it was thought that most people would die if another ship was too far away to rescue them immediately. Far from the usual dry historical commentaries, it's a wonderfully articulate track.<br /><br />Although it's missing theatrical trailers, this is a pretty comprehensive boxed set for \\"Titanic\\". It's filled with wonderful behind-the-scenes footage, photos, production art, featurettes and commentary tracks. The two disc presentation of the movie has better clarity, remarkable detail and color when compared to the previous single disc edition of the movie. This is one that you'll definitely want if you're a fan of the movie.\\" is designed so you can view the entire gallery or individual sections which include everything from the \\"Southampton Departure\\" sequence to the \\"Final Sinking Sequence\\" from the film and includes nine sequences in total. \\"Production Artwork\\" includes production paintings by Tom Lay, costume design art by David Le Vey and \\"Wreck Sketches\\" done by James Cameron. \\"Photographs\\" covers the deep dive that Cameron did as well as photos from the model shop and even includes the extras' scrapbook with photos of the extras during production as well as behind-the-scenes photos of the sets.

Surprisingly, carrying a concealed fire arm was not that uncommon. There were a lot of bodies that were discovered with guns on them. Cameron also points out that no one wanted to get off the ship into the boats because the band was still playing and everyone still thought that perhaps it was a drill.    The cast and production crew provide a second audio track. Whenever the speaker changes there is atitle telling you who is speaking. Covering everything from the actor's preparation for the film (from reading books about the incident to talking with historians) to production details (producer Jon Landau provides a unique perspective since he is both a producer and a director), it's equally as fascinating as Cameron's track or the one done by the historians. While there is some duplication (how can there not be?) most of the commentary tracks have enough new information to keep each one interesting on its own. Having three commentary tracks might seem like overkill but, well, this is a James Cameron film and Cameron is known for exhaustive detail in both his research and his production of his films.        The third audio commentary track features historians discussing the accuracy of the film and the world in 1912. It's amazing how accurate Cameron's film is. The historians point out that misinformation was rampant and stewards told people to go to bed because the ship probably just dropped a propeller blade.  Cameron was worried that the davits that lowered the lifeboats might break during the sequences when they lowered them. The concept of a major sea rescue at the time was unthinkable. If a ship went down, it was thought that most people would die if another ship was too far away to rescue them immediately. Far from the usual dry historical commentaries, it's a wonderfully articulate track.     Although it's missing theatrical trailers, this is a pretty comprehensive boxed set for \\"Titanic\\". It's filled with wonderful behind-the-scenes footage, photos, production art, featurettes and commentary tracks. The two disc presentation of the movie has better clarity, remarkable detail and color when compared to the previous single disc edition of the movie. This is one that you'll definitely want if you're a fan of the movie.
0064400557|5.0|Someone summed it up perfectly as that.  I just enjoyed <br />reading this book with my 1rst grade son.  The book engaged <br />him as well as challenged him.  A full analysis is needed on all the levels and how....well i'm sure someone did that somewhere in these reviews.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I personally think this is the best Batman movie to date. The story, although cartoon in character, leads the audience on a journey that's almost believable. We witness the spiritual growth of a tortured soul who's parents had been killed by a down and dirty, mid-city mugger. Bruce Wayne had disappeared from civilization only to be found hiding at the far reaches of humanity in a personal depression. We view his rise from someone searching for revenge and vengeance to a concerned and vigilant citizen trying to right the wrongs of corruption and crime in society. And although Batman is good, he is a dark hero and he really enjoys hunting and playing with his prey. Perhaps a touch of evil lurks inside the masked crusader himself. <br /> <br />What a great cast of actors, Christian Bale who plays Batman and a supporting cast of great talent: Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutgar Hauer, Ken Watanabe, and Morgan Freeman. This is the first time I have seen Katie Holmes in a film - disappointing. <br /> <br />I saw this DVD on a home theater, wide screen TV and I was very impressed. The cinematography is exceptional and so is the great musical soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. Christopher Nolan is a very good director, coming from classic films like Memento. He rose to the occasion with this film, making it the best off the series. I look forward to more from Mr. Nolan.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Far funnier and consistent than any other John Cleese <br />work (yes, better than any Monty Python product, although <br />some of their greatest hits collections could come close). <br />Wonderful array of characters and relationships, great wit, <br />sarcasm, and delightfully derogatory and playfully petulant. <br />The use of a half dozen sets keeps the action fresh, including <br />an infrequent outdoor shot.  Cleese frantically zings and slings, Booth steers the ship, Sybil's the foil, and Manuel <br />is ever manic as the Coronel walks in the effervescent fog of it all.  12 tight yet frolicking episodes in the greatest hotel no one wants to visit. \\"Right! Well...this is it! I'm going to give you a damn good thrashing!!!\\"
B000AU9UYM|4.0|Batman gets a bad rap in comics and movies as a supposedly \\"dark\\" hero.  But really, like the criminal elements he haunts, so many people have missed the point.  Batman is not dark.  He's about justice, helping people, protecting the innocent, and stopping the guilty.  His dark image is just how he chooses to become a larger than life \\"supernatural\\" force against crime, but it's merely a tool to fight evil.  Anyone who misses that doesn't understand Batman at all. <br /> <br />I HATED Tim Burton's Batman interpretations.  To begin with, the bad guys were more important than Batman.  True, they're complex characters and a lot of fun to watch, but the movies did a lousy job of that, too.  A bunch of loonies running around in funny costumes is not what superheroes are about. <br /> <br />This film understands that.  It begins slow, presenting a very real, very damaged Gotham City.  The same could be said for Bruce Wayne.  His development from spoiled richboy to force of justice is both believable and larger than life.  A very neat trick. <br /> <br />The cast is perfect, especially Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon who finally gets to be the good cop he never got to be in the TV or movies.  And the script solid. The only bad thing about it (-1 star) is the clumsy action scenes, which can be difficult to follow.  Still, a great rendition that I was overjoyed to finally see made.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Dance of Death is the follow up to the slightly inferior - but quite good in its own right - Brave New World.  Just as the last disc, Maiden recorded DoD as a six piece and the three guitar attack is consistenyly excellent.  The playing is crisp and tight and Dickinson's vocals are spot on.  The entire album is a solid showcase of Maiden's strengths, Harris and McBrain's rhythm work as a solid foundation for killer guitar work complete with shredding solos all punctuated by Dickinson's wailing lead vocal.  Maiden has never sounded any better than this. <br /> <br />The high points of DoD are definately Montsegur and Paschendale, both tracks trowing back to Maiden's long record of delvinging to history for inspiration in their music.  Montsegur is definately the heavier of the two - in fact the heaviest song on the album, a thunderous assault driven by the guitars and Harris near rhythm guitar style of bass playing.  Paschendale , on the other hand, is a long (8 minute +) recounting of the famous ww1 battle in the town of the same name.  The song builds as it goes, filled with fantastic guitar solos and an incredible vocal performance by Dickinson.  Every bit as good as anything the band has ever done, this one ranks with Hallowed Be Thy Name and others as Maiden classics. <br /> <br />Rainmaker, Face in the Sand and the title Track fill out the rest of the disc in solid fashion.  No More Lies is a bit of an odd track compared to the rest (though not any more so than the album closing Journeyman) and starts off quite slow with an uncharacteristically mellow vocal that picks up as it goes and over all satisfies - though perhaps not in traditional Maiden style.  Gates of Tomorrow and Age on Innocence are fairly average tracks - for Maiden-wise anyway.  Neither is spectacular, but they are quite good songs, 'Age' being the slightly better of the two.  The albm ends with the aforementioned Journeyman.  A fully acoustic track, the songs seems at first quite out of place on the disc, but the solid song writing is quite apparent upon further listening and the vocal performance is excellent.  Don't let the acoustic throw you off - this is no pop ballad. <br /> <br />all in all, this is an excellent metal album by the greatest metal band on the planet right now.  Only the avergae quality of Gates of Tomorrow and Age of Innocence keep this from being 5 stars, but, as mentioned, they are hardly bad songs by any measure.   <br /> <br />Any serious Metal fan needs this one in his/her collection.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera was one of the greatest metal bands in the history of the genre and they will be for years to come. I strongly advise people shopping for Pantera albums here NOT to listen to that so-called 'Pantera-hater' person who has nothing better to do than sit on his ass and complain about how much he hates the band. First off, dude, I'm sorry Phil Anselmo can't rap for you like Fred Durst or whine like Chester Bennington (I'm sure you like that better anyway) and I'm sorry that you obviously have no knowledge of the complexities of guitar-playing that prevents you from enjoying Dimebag...just because you can't play it yourself doesn't mean you have to rip on it. Show some f***in' respect for the man, he was murdered for god's sakes! If you don't like the music, then DON'T LISTEN TO IT! Nobody is forcing you to like Pantera, man. Go back to listening to Good Charlotte or Britney Spears and leave Pantera and Dimebag alone. <br /> <br />F*** off Panter-hater and Panter haters everywhere. I hope you all die just like the piece of s*** that shot Dime.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Yeah, this movie is almost perfect, it's the best Batman movie to date, a must see for anybody. All the good stuffs been gone over already, so I'll just point out the two things that I think could have been better. <br />1. The action, most it was to hard to follow, I know why they did this, but I didn't like it. <br />2.More attention should have been paid to the Scarecrow, I didn't feel like I got to know him well enough during the movie, he didn't seem like a character. <br /> <br />Other then those two things this movie is amazing, I do miss Keaton (nobody can replace him as Batman IMO) and I do miss Burtons image of Gotham city, but overall you can't beat this movie, and it seems to be a great price here on Amazon, at stores the 2-disc set is going for $30!!! This is a must have movie...get it.
B00000D9TQ|3.0|Some people here miss the point: Hits compilations do NOT collect an artist's \\"best\\" work. They collect their biggest pop charters. That's why \\"Like China\\"(an oft mentioned album track by reviewers here) doesn't make the cut. It missed the pop chart entirely. When you don't call a collection \\"essential\\" or \\"best\\", you imply the criteria for inclusion is chart placement exclusively. On that score, this one does pretty well.<br /><br />Musically, the validity of Collins weaves wildly, from the great melodrama of \\"I Wish it Would Rain Down\\" and the menace of \\"In the Air Tonight\\" to the oozing goo of \\"Separate Lives\\". On that score, it would benefit from an approach that would include cherry-picked Collins-era Genesis material like \\"Invisible Touch\\", \\"That's All\\" and \\"Land of Confusion\\" to replace some of the fluffier solo hits. Many radio listeners probably confuse the two (since Collins sang lead on all those Genesis hits) and the same record label has rights to both acts anyway.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Despite the nay-sayers here, this collection tried not to be too USA-centric in including \\"Both Sides of the Story\\" (#7 U.K.) and \\"Dance into the Light\\" (#9 U.K.) despite relatively poor performance Stateside.<br /><br />15 of these songs hit the Top 10 in the U.S. or U.K. (or both)<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />U.S. #4 charters \\"Do you Remember?\\" and \\"Don't Lose my Number\\" absolutely should have made it on here. You could axe the Cyndi Lauper remake to make room. People would buy this without a \\"new\\" single...it could have been held for a later effort.<br /><br />#39 \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\" would have been a nice inclusion (it's pretty heavily played on U.S. \\"classic rock\\" radio stations) and same goes for U.S. #14 \\"I Missed Again\\", but you have to make some judgement calls in a single disc and these were forgivable ones from a commercial (if not artistic) standpoint.<br /><br />No lyrics, song insights or liner notes of any sort. Just a mini-poster.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Probably the BEST package would blend Collins/Genesis stuff together in a 2CD set with all the stuff \\"casual\\" fans want. But as far as solo Phil goes, this is about as much as you could expect.<br /><br />3 stars/>BOTTOM LINE: <br />Probably the BEST package would blend Collins/Genesis stuff together in a 2CD set with all the stuff \\"casual\\" fans want.

0670033375|5.0|The author tries to prove that societal collapse is a result of environmental degradation and/or deteriotation using the framework he developed.   And he uses examples of both modern and ancient societieis to augument his claim.  He has 12 chapters starting from Montana to ancient Mayans.    <br /> <br />The last chapter of the book is very alarming in that the current resource consumption of the first world country is not sustainable in the near term and we're looking at the worldwide catastrophe, e.g. war.   He claims himself to be cautious optimists and argues that we can avoid the doomsday scenario by working together.   <br /> <br />I, however, am very pessimistic in that in the near future, world will be wrought with countries fighting for dwindling resources, e.g. oil.  I sincenrly hope that my prediction will be incorrect, however.     <br />

B000AMJDHY|5.0|I got kind of tired of \\"Amazing!\\" and \\"Spectacular!\\". <br /> <br />Anyways, Panic! At The Disco's lead singer does sound strikingly similar to Patrick Stumph, but that's because they have the same influences. The lead singer's enunciation is what sets the two singers apart. You can recognize what he is saying, whereas in many Fall Out Boy songs, people find themselves arguing over what the lyrics really are. <br /> <br />That's not important. What is important is this band's music is fantastic, my friend. Trust me on this. Extremely catchy, you'll find yourself humming the melodies of these songs. <br /> <br />The lead singer's enunciation is specatcular. I find myself listening to tracks 12 and 13 repeatedly. There's A Reason... reminds me of some old showtune. The piano melodies along with other awesome instrumentals, as well as a great lead singer makes for one catchy song.  Build God, Then We'll Talk is unbelievable. The story is excellent, and the play on \\"My Favorite Things\\" is ingenious. <br /> <br />In short, buy this CD. You won't be disappointed.
0743454537|5.0|This was the first book by Jodi Picoult that I ever read.  I found that the flashbacks from Sara were helpful in showing where her loyalties were, on Kate or Anna.  While I find that a character like Jesse is stereotypical in this type of novel, he provides an interesting viewpoint and is a chance to escape the drama of the novel for a while.  One problem that I had with the book was in the way it was designed.  I did not like how different fonts were used for different characters.  I understand why Picoult would do this, but to me it seems unneccessary.  The book brings up some great issues on what promises to be more and more in the spotlight as science and biology progress.  A book that I definitely recommend.
B000683VI4|2.0|An avid Spark reader, I expected to have a romantic, sad tale as its precessors, the tale started off a cute, lighthearted, sweet story of summer love. AFter about 30 minutes into the film, I lost all interest as Hollywood took this tale into a questionable movie to show teens. It was sweet and loveable, but for parental sake, I would watchg this movie BEFORE showing your young teens.
B000002UAF|4.0|AHDN, was the first album by the Beatles to contain songs exclusively by Lennon and McCartney. And some cracking songs were featured on it too. The first noticeable thing after hearing the album was that it appeared that the Beatles were beginning to change their style and take on a more subtle approach. Whereas the first 2 albums had the typical boyish Merseybeat sound, AHDN seemed to aim for more thoughtful songs and ballads in particular. Such tracks as \\"If I fell\\", \\"And I love her\\", \\"Things we said today\\" and \\"I'll be back\\", were typical examples of this being high quality ballads relying largely on an acoustic and melodic approach. But there were 2 classic Lennon rockers as well. The title track, AHDN, with its unforgettable opening crash chord, (completely novel at the time) and \\"Any time at all\\", both showed how well Lennon was progressing as a songwriter. Another great & bluesey effort from him was \\"You can't do that\\", with menacing lyrics and delivery. I'll cry instead\\" is a pleasant up-tempo C&W style song from Lennon, which swings along nicely. McCartney wrote the first single released from the AHDN, \\"Can't buy me love\\", also bluesy in style, and has long been adopted as a standard by the jazz fraternity in many different interpretations.<br /><br />There were 3 tracks which I never cared for, and still had the old Merseybeat stamp on them: \\"Tell me why\\", which Lennon, years later admitted was one of his worst songs. \\"When I get home\\" is my least favourite. They could have left this one off the album. \\"I'm happy just to dance with you\\" is much better and has an interesting rhythm guitar chugging along in the background, but still sounds old-fashioned, compared to the more sophisticated direction in which the Beatles were going with some of these tracks. But despite these minor flaws, AHDN is still a very good album overall. George Harrison's newly discovered 'love', the 12 string Rickenbacker electric guitar features prominently on the album and adds further interest.<br /><br />Highly recommended.rest.     Highly recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I opened the case for the first disk, and there, in the jacket, floating quietly above Serenity, was a familiar planet.  It is Venus in reds and oranges, thanks to the Magellan spacecraft radar data.  Real data from a NASA probe.  Then the big moment, I lifted the first disk out of the jewel case.  Under the disc, basking in glory, is Mars, Valles Marinaris hemisphere, likely Viking or MGS data.  Whoever is responsible for the graphic design on Firefly's boxed set deserves commendation for using some of the best imagery from real space missions.  Thanks!
B0002858YS|3.0|Of course the \\"Mr. Brightside\\" hit is wonderful and the rest of the album is worth listening too.  Don't expect too much and you won't be let down.  The Killers just don't seem to go all the way.  It seems like they are good for at least one song per CD but it would be interesting to hear them push all the way through to where they seem to be going.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is a different Coldplay then the one that expressed itself in the previous two albums. This album is much more commercial and dense, and might appeal less to certain listeners. <br />But with that said, this album is a creative explosion of melody, sound and force. Almost all the tracks are winners, easily 'single' material. The sounds are massive and sweeping, and the melodies are great. Everything is spot on and tightly in place- from the crescendos to the smallest background sounds accompanying Martin's voice. (For a great example notice the sounds that fluctuate in entropy just before the chorus of \\"Low\\".) <br /> <br />A massive and enjoyable album that would appeal to many rock fans, not just Coldplay's.
B0006L0LOS|1.0|This movie had some of the worst special effects I've ever seen!  They were so bad, they were actually amusing.  I found the acting to be terrible too.  One last thought, wasn't the original Catwoman white? Avoid this one.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Unfortunately, as much as I hate to put only four stars, I have to be honest. I don't doubt I'll be getting a lot of negative responses from people who freak out (four instead of five?! no way!) and automatically assume it's a bad review. But let me explain to you my reasons, and maybe you'll consider what I say.    Final Fantasy VII was a great game -- unrivaled as far as I'm concerned. And the game had so much mystery, so many unanswered questions, so much to be mused on by the player. This is one of the reasons Final Fantasy VII still managed to be talked about for so long after it came out, and why it was such a great game. But unforunately, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children gave up that essential aspect of Final Fantasy VII. There isn't any mystery really, everything is blatant, leaving you with nothing to speculate on. This was a great loss I feel, and a great mistake.     Secondly, the plot was essentially nonexistant. My attention was held due to the beautiful graphics and because it's Final Fantasy of course. But, the plot was so shallow and underdeveloped that I hardly even gave much thought to the plot while watching it. It didn't grab me like Final Fantasy VII's plot did. What they did instead is make a movie full of [awesome] fight scenes. But they gave up developing the plot in favor of the fight scenes. They playing to the guys who love a great fight scene and tossing out the more difficult, imo, thing of making a great plot. Probably they didn't have much to make a plot on, so they made up for it with the fight scenes.    Okay, so those are the bad aspects, now let me tell you why it still gets four stars. The graphics were awesome. I already mentioned that, but really, they are great. The movements were smooth, the fight scenese were amazingly realistic (er... the movements, not exactly what they're doing, though hey, that's okay) and the expressions were well done. The voice acting was absolutely perfect; I wasn't horrified at the actors they chose and the voices matched them all. The music, also, was fantastic (go buy the soundtrack! It's remarkable!) So the aesthetics were, in essence, absolutely wonderful.    Also, the characters' essences were still intact. The Cloud was still the same Cloud, Tifa the same Tifa, etc. Especially great, I thought, was that they kept the humorous qualities of the Turks (though amplified). They added a bit of humor in the overall dark atmosphere in the movie. Keeping the characters who they were originally is a vital aspect, since the characters are what most people feel close and connected to. It was comforting to know they were still the same.    Finally, Advent Children did a great job playing on your emotions. They knew you probably knew the characters, and they made the characters have real thoughts and real emotions. The conflicts concerned the viewer, and the end was especially great at pulling the emotions in.    In essence, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children was a great film. It had a [rather major] flaw of having a weak plot, but it was still a great film. Final Fantasy VII fans, you will still love it. Everyone else, you will really like it, though the lack of a great plot might get to you a little more than the FF fans. I encourage everyone to try it out though.

B000AARKOO|1.0|Some how director thought it would be more interesting if you could not  see it.  It was not the plot, the acting but the filming.  It was filmed at dark, at dusk, inside a building or tent with only one candle for light .  We turned it off 3/4 of the way through because we could not see it.  I imagine there was the same problem in theaters. If it was not for voice recognition we could not have figured who was doing what to whom. Fortunately I know some history of the Templars and the invasion of Middle East (still going on). Don't waste your money

B000AJJNPY|5.0|It has been a long, long time since Sigur Ros' previous release \\"(  )\\" in 2002, but well worth the wait.  \\"Takk\\" (Icelandic for \\"thanks\\") still employs the group's hauntingly beautiful style and epic soundscapes of understated lulls, emotional climaxes, guitars moaning under the cello bow, and Jnsi Birgisson's heavenly falsetto.  It is however, a more upbeat album than \\"( ).\\" <br /> <br />I do not believe there is any way to truly put words to their music, simply because it's nearly impossible to be cognizant that you're actually listening to it.  Every time I lie down and listen to this album in its entirety, I end up drifting off into my own special world.  But I'll have a go at it anyways. <br /> <br />Sigur Ros is one of the few contemporary bands out there that makes albums for the sake of albums; everything ebbs, flows, and fits together just perfectly.  It's the kind of album you need to listen to its entirety to get the full musical experience.  Specifically, there are several stand-out tracks on \\"Takk\\" - the foremost being \\"Seaglopur.\\"  I absolutely cannot stop listening to it.  It's like a spring day, a rebirth.  The song that will suddenly appear at the top of your iTunes \\"most played\\" list.  Its repetitive and understated piano lines accompanied by an airy, ethereal voice gives the song the feel of an Icelandic lullaby.  After a few listens you'll catch yourself trying to play \\"air piano\\" to this song.   While it seems out of character for Sigur Ros, one might even say they \\"rock out\\" at the end of the song.   <br /> <br />Coming in at a close second is \\"Gong.\\"  Its placement in the track listing is just perfect.  The previous track, \\"Milano,\\" exits by completely by fading into silence - but just long enough for you to snap out of it and think... damn, it's over already?   Then, almost just as that thought is finishing, the melancholy yet inviting violin of \\"Gong\\" catches your ears, slowly layered upon by a discordant guitar and fast-paced snare drum.Like Radiohead's \\"Climbing up the Walls\\" it takes you away to a darker place, but, brings you back to the overall mood of \\"Takk\\" by the end.  <br /> <br />The ending of the album is strangely familiar and completely lulling.  The final song, \\"Heysatan\\" quietly tapers off into silence, broken only by the clatter of discarded drumsticks which differentiates this moment of silence from any other on the album.  The show's over.  Very similar to the crackle of a suddenly unplugged guitar at the end of     \\"( ),\\" and just as effective.   The only think I missed about the conclusion of \\"Takk\\" is a song along the lines of \\"Untitled #8,\\" which captured so much energy in \\"( )\\" and provided such an orgasmic release.  (Especially when you hear it live, it overtakes you, gives such a transcendent experience.) <br /> <br />If you thought \\"( )\\" was a too reminiscent of a funeral, but still enjoyed it, you'll find \\"Takk\\" imaginative and beautiful.  If you're one of those who has heard a few tracks, liked what you heard, but are unsure how you'll feel about Sigur Ros' music as a whole, try this album out - it is quite possibly one of their most accessible.  Still, if you thought 1999's \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\" was a bit too \\"art house\\" for your tastes, then \\"Takk\\" will be just about as welcoming as a swift kick to the side.   <br /> <br />\\"Takk\\" is the perfect listen for a crisp Fall day, for getting lost within yourself, or just escaping to nowhere.  It just makes life feel better.
B000002B5L|4.0|Album The Score je tipican primer za nesto sto se zove precenjeno. OK, ovaj album jeste dobar, ali ne onoliko koliko su ga hvalili kriticari i uspaljena masa. Album pocinje zaista dobro i uverljivo posle uvodne Red Intro, sledi How Many Mics, onda kultna Ready Or Not ujedno i najjaca pesma na albumu, nadovezuje se nista manje bolja Zealots u kojoj W.J sija. Za sada ide sve kako treba, ali jos nigde nema nagovestaja o remekdelu. I evoga, prvi problem za The Score sa imenom The Beast, W.J i L.H kao da su snimali u dva razlicita studija, ali situaciju izvlaci sledeca pesma naravno Fu-Gee-La sa apsolutno hipnoticnim ritmom i jezivo hladnim glasom L.H koja peva uulalala. Family Business jos jedan pozitivan poen za Fugees, ali idalje nema govora o nekakvom remekdelu, a sledi i dokaz za to obrada Killing Me Softly koja je ko zna iz kojeg razloga postala planetarni ultra hit. Zanimljivo je da je i obrada No Woman No Cry bas kao i Killing Me Softly obradjena po istom principu. Uzete su dve zaista odlicne pesme za koje morate da budete bas totalni antitalenti da bi ste uspeli da ih iskasapite, zato su Fugees igrali na sigurno ali besmisleno, sve je ostalo isto samo su dodali malo ritma i ubacili totalnog nepotrebnog repovanja. To masi nije smetalo, a ni \\"vajnim\\" kriticarima. Sledi pesma The Score sa besmislenim tekstom ali odlicnim ritmom, a onda i The Mask koju nazalost Fugees nisu izbacili kao singl i kao takva nikada nije bila zapazena onoliko koliko bi trebalo. Cowboys, veliki promasaj i najslabija tacka albuma, za kojom sledi No Woman No Cry i napokon Manifest/Outro koji zatvara album. <br />I to je to! <br />Imamo znaci How Many Mics, Ready Or Not, Fu-Gee-La, i The Mask. <br />Da li su cetiri pesme dovoljne da bi se jedan album uzdizao do nebesa kako su to cinili kriticari? <br />Ne. <br />Potrebno je mnogo vise, ali ja im dajem jednu precenjenu 4 samo zato sto su uspeli da naprave neverovatan mit o sebi.
B000000ZGO|5.0|This is arguably one of the greatest soul albums of all time. Despite the fact that it only has four cuts, each cut takes on a life of it's own. The album spans from lush and orchestral melodies to down right low and funky grooves. <br /> <br />The Bar Kays provide a solid, infectious backbeat to set the stage for Isaac's soulful drama and the result is mesmerizing.  <br /> <br />Isaac's cover of \\"By the Time I get to Phoenix\\", is incredible. It starts with a monologue that builds into a searing heap of soul that's enough to make a grown man cry. I speak from experience. <br /> <br />No disrespect to Dionne Warwick, but Isaac makes his version of \\"Walk on By\\" all his own. The powerful, orchestral intro in and of itself sheer genius. The song goes on to explore multiple moods before erupting into a shattering climax that leaves the listener almost out of breath. <br /> <br />To me, \\"Hyperbolic...\\" is the signature cut here. It is as funky as it is bluesy and will at the very least have your head nodding if you're not out and out dancing. The throbbing bass line carries the tune and sets a nice backdrop for Isaac's tinkling piano and the funky wah wah guitar that caresses it. Again, genius. <br /> <br />If ever an album were a masterpiece, Hot Buttered Soul is it. It is a timeless musical experience not soon forgotten.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Oni koji Neil Young nisu voleli do sada, nece ga zavoleti ni sa ovim albumom. Oni koji su ga voleli, nastavice. Ovo je jednostavno Neil klasika. Apsolutno magicno. Dokaz da stara skola jos uvek moze mnogo toga da da. <br />
B000025SJ8|1.0|No matter how untalented you might be, or how terrible your music is, if you know how to market yourself right and create an interesting legend around yourself, the kids will worship you. Varg has proven this. I can't help but laugh every time I hear some 17 year old kid going off on how amazing Burzum is, Varg is the greatest of all time, \\"black metal begins here maaan!\\", blah blah. Please, Burzum is mediocre at best. And mediocrity has never been something that should be celebrated, no matter how much hype has been built up. If you want to hear some black metal worth listening to, pick up a Bathory CD and shut up about Varg's pathetic attempts at creating music. This is cacaphonic noise pollution for idiot hessian bigot teenagers to jerk off to, nothing more. Someday when you kids are older you'll look back at Burzum and just laugh and feel embarrassed that you ever paid money for this.
B00006ADGP|4.0|Una Giornata Particolare is one of my favorites movies ever. I was very dissapointed about the dub and the bad image. It seems that it was record straight from a TV set. It looks like an illegal copy. <br />It is amazing how an excellent movie can be harm without scruples!

B000002J09|5.0|If Led Zeppelin's greatest conquest was giving birth to heavy metal and spawning a countless number of imitators, then their second finest achievement is their fourth and best album, \\"Led Zeppelin IV.\\" This disc is arguably one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) heavy metal albums of all time.<br /><br />Several instant classics (i.e. \\"Black Dog,\\" \\"Rock and Roll,\\" and, of course, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\") are featured here. \\"Black Dog\\" has a world renowned intro, as well as vocals (\\"Ah, ah, ah, ah,\\") and humming guitars which are equally as catchy. Next, you have probably heard \\"Rock And Roll\\" before, because it has been played in various places (like commercials for Cadillac cars) and has been covered by a number of other bands/artists. This song is equally as catchy as \\"Black Dog,\\" and is a personal favorite of mine. It has a very memorable opening guitar riff, as well as catchy drum beats and vocals, and a nice guitar solo (near the end). \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" is not only considered to be the best song ever recorded by Led Zeppelin, but it also features a guitar solo which is thought to be the best ever!<br /><br />But those aren't the only notable songs on here. \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" takes things down a notch, because it is just a power ballad with acoustic guitars and mandolins (\\"Going To California\\" also features these instruments). Track five, \\"Misty Mountain Hop,\\" is a mid-tempo song with textured/\\"layered\\" guitar strings and keyboards, and the next song, \\"Four Sticks\\" features vocals (by Robert Plant) which sound almost electronic. Finally, \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" is another famous song, and a great album closer. This song is mostly famous because it has a great drum beat, but it also has some driving guitars, powerful vocals, and even a wailing harmonica.<br /><br />All you need to know about \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" is it is, hands down, one of the best and most important albums of all time. It's worth buying just for \\"Stairway To Heaven,\\" and if you like heavy metal, you should buy this C.D. just so you can say you own it! It is simply a classic metal album which is essential listening for everybody (even casual fans), and it will forever have a spot on heavy metal's timeline.y this C.D. just so you can say you own it!

B000AL730O|5.0|In reading reviews for this disc, I've come across quite a few negative comments regarding the \\"downer\\" feeling this album has. I, for one, welcomed it. As much as I love Paul's bright, bubbly sense of optimism, the overall darker tone of this album is refreshing. I would say it's the only one of his albums I can listen to over and over, all the way through. I can't even do that with McCartney, Ram, or even (gasp)Band on the Run! It's funny, when Paul does a bright poppy record, critics complain. When he gets introspective and dark, fans complain. Oh, well.     This album could (should?)have been called McCartney III. Much of the songs recall his best stuff on McC I, Ram, and touches of his input on Abbey, side two. Comparisons are plentiful elsewhere in other reviews, but my own take is that \\"English Tea\\" doesn't sound so much White Album as it sounds like \\"For No One\\" from Revolver. On \\"Promise To You\\", Paul employs the same strangled singing voice he used on \\"Nineteen Hundred Eighty Five\\" from Band On The Run. \\"Back Seat of My Car\\" is hinted at in \\"Promise\\" and \\"This Never Happened\\". George Harrison is all over \\"Friends To Go\\". Might be the best song, though in my opinion, the album's centerpiece is \\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\", which is the most somber, dark song on this album. But hey, not all the songs are dark- \\"English\\" and \\"Friends\\" are peppy!      Bottom line? Buy it if you're open to music like Radiohead and Travis, more somber tones that need maybe a few listenings to digest and appreciate. Skip if you need Macca-lite, spoon fed to you with a sprinkling of moptop to help it go down. I'm really loving this introspective album from James Paul, the kid from Liverpool.
B00005JNZ4|3.0|There's nothing wrong with 'Must Love Dogs.'  It has two exceptionally likable characters in center played by Diane Lane and John CUsack, is supported by solid acting from Elizabeth Perkins and Durmot Mulroney, plus veterans Christopher Plummer and Stockard Channing, and also features two cute dogs.  The only problem is that what you see in this film, you have already seen in other romantic comedies that have been made these last twenty years. <br /> <br />Sarah (Lane) is a kindergarten teacher, recently divorced (for 8 months), who is afraid of dating.  She meets two possible boyfriends -- Bob (Mulroney) daddy of her kids, a handsome, slightly caddish but not a bad guy, and Jake (Cusack) a boat-builder, avid fan of old films like Doctor Zhivago, who also recently parted from his love.  Sounds familiar, isn't it? <br /> <br />But of course there are some differences.  Sarah meets Jake through the internet site.  And you can see lovely Lane in 'CATS'-like Holloween costume.  And ... did I tell you about wonderful Christopher Plummer, who reads a poem very beautifully?  That much I can tell you. <br /> <br />In spite of many things recycled from the past films, the two leads Lane and Cusack are quite good.  They have played similar roles in the past, but that doesn't mean that 'Must Love Dogs' is waste of your time.  Still, we know that there must be a better story out there for them, and that they are also aware of that fact. <br /> <br />Pleasant, feel-good romantic comedy, 'Must Love Dogs' is like an extended episode of TV sitcom.  It goes where we know it goes, and avoids risky steps during its 100 minutes.  That's not a bad thing, I know, but if you use Diane Lane and John Cusack, maybe you should do better than that.
B000AL730O|4.0|My CD was \\"copy controlled\\" and jumped in places on my (new!) CD player. Chap at the shop showed me a trick with a felt tip pen so I was able to make a computer copy which then did work on my CD player. Took me 3 hours - I'm getting too old for this nonsense. Give me a CD that you can just play. It's not stopping the copying anyway, just annoying honest customers.    Anyway: I find the material truly pleasant and it grows on me with every listening. This is a keeper and I am glad to add it to my collection. I cannot understand why Paul draws so much vitriol. Do fans expect \\"Yesterday\\" every time?     There are echos of early days, even in the production techniques. Hard left-right stereo, for example.    Paul uses some unusual instruments. One seems to be a wind instrument and is fascinating! Pity there's no instrument listing. (PS: oops there IS! OK, it's a Duduk - experimentation with exotic instruments again as in the early days) and a recorder, played by Paul himself.    To be a bit critical, I find the technical side less good. There is a lot of compression which is inappropriate on the more acoustic songs. And there is a lot of bass and treble boost on individual instruments which makes Paul's voice sound like it is coming through an EQ'd hole in the middle.    Nevertheless, it remains an \\"open\\" mix and the individual sounds stay separate - except for the rockers, but that's the way rockers are supposed to be!    Pity it's only 14 songs - I saw Paul live in Zurich, and boy did we get value for money - \\"Here's another number from the early 60's\\" - Yeah!     (PS: There's a 14th song tacked onto the end of the 13th track without a break nor a title. It's an instrumental rocker version of \\"Fine Line\\", again echoing \\"Sgt. Pepper - Reprieve\\")

(The 14th song is tacked onto the end of the 13th track and is the \\"Fine Line - Reprieve\\" played rock instrumental style)     The DVD is great. More than just a \\"Making Of\\", it has closeups of the instruments as they lie in the studio, including the Hfner and other classics. For me it was interesting to see how studios operate nowadays. The producer continues working with the artist whilst the assistants sit at Apple laptops,editing and modifying just-recorded tracks.     We get a bit of insight into the eternal question \\"How do you come up with your ideas for songs, Paul?\\". Paul's book \\"Many Years from Now\\" also covers this. Very informative to someone like me who also tries to pen the odd ditty. Paul says when he writes a song, he pretends to be someone else, say like Ray Charles, but when it's finished, it comes out uniquely his. When I do a song, I try do it like it's uniquely mine, but my friends then say, \\"Hey, that sounds like that Ray Charles number!\\" and I go \\"Oh. Oh yeah. Oh heck.\\" :)    But to sum up, the whole package is absolutely worth the purchase price. An album/DVD set to treasure.

B000002V07|5.0|Twelve years ago I was sitting on a porch in a college town in the early fall, waiting to go to a party, and the song \\"Fade Into You\\" came over the radio. I can still remember the way the plaintive sound of Hope Sandoval's voice, woven into those languid guitar strains, settled over my nervous system with an  effect that can only be described as hypnotic. It was a bright, sunny day, but all the sudden I felt like it was half past midnight, and I had nothing to keep me company but a candle and a big bottle of red wine. I was so haunted by the song that at the first opportunity I went out to a record store and bought the CD, \\"So Tonight That I Might See.\\" It remains my all-time favorite, a bottle of \\"the good stuff\\" that I break out only on special occasions.<br /><br />People have a tendency to discuss albums song by song, but \\"So Tonight That I Might See\\" is, to me, just one long piece of music, performed in an unvaryingly mellow and often longing tone of voice. The mood weaves its thread through every track, binding them together into a singular piece of music that is wierdly and intensely beautiful. I would never insult this dark masterwork by skipping ahead to a certain song; I either listen to the whole album (on repeat, drinking some good absinthe if possible and letting the grooves take me where they may) or I don't listen at all. There are rules to drinking the good stuff, you see.<br /><br />Cheers.
0316168815|4.0|The Lovely Bones is one of the best books I have read in a long time. Alice Seabold, writes it in such a way that is easy for teens to read and connect to. Stories like this are hard to make so interesting, but she writes in such a way that you cannot put the book down. I loved how well she depicts a teenage girls thoughts, it was like reading a fourteen year-old girls diary. I loved reading about the imperfections she sees' in her family as she is in heaven. It shows that parents are far from perfect. Her mother, for example, you see her as the perfect mom at first, heartbroken from losing her daughter, but as the book goes on you realize she is nothing like what she seemed. As I kept reading, I began to love her father and feel what it really means to lose someone. You read about him destroying his last memories from his daughter and weeping into her pillows, you cannot feel anything but sorrow for him. Another thing that was interesting in reading this book is the extent rapist will go to get what they want. Her rapist, Mr. Harvey, seemed a lonely, sad man that anyone would feel bad for. However, he knows exactly what he is doing, and in the end gets away with it. It kind of brings you into what exactly they are thinking when they do these things, and how dangerous they really are. Though there is much sadness in this book, you also find humor, and happiness, which balanced the book out. It wasn't all about death and loss, but hope and how happy a person can be. An important lesson I learned in this book is closure. If we dwell on the horrible things that happened to us, we will never enjoy the good things. I really enjoyed this book and Alice Seabold has become one of my new favorite authors, and I look forward to reading another one of her books.
B000AARKOO|5.0|Ridley Scott's \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is a brilliant film set in Jerusalem during the time of the Crusades, a dark time in the history of Christianity, when fanatics killed needlessly in the name of Jesus Christ. While slow in it's buildup, the film features exciting battle sequences, amazing visual effects, and (Most important of all) great performances by a stellar cast. And it's fair depiction of both Christian and Muslim alike lends to it a cautionary tale about how we need to get along despite are differences, and that fanatics of all religions are dangerous people who need to be dealt with.<br /><br />The Widescreen DVD release features impressive sound-and-picture quality. The main extra, the production grid, features nine featurettes that, although very well-done, are not as good as the seven-part documentary for the Extended DVD of \\"Gladiator.\\" Even better are the \\"Movie Real\\" documentary that presents the truth behind the movie, and the \\"History vs. Hollywood\\" documentary that details both the fact and fiction behind this amazing film. The four internet featurettes and theatrical trailer are good as well.<br /><br />\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is a fantastic film that belongs in everyone's collection of historical epics.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A-

B00005JNJV|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I bought this, I'd heard good reviews...but another remake? I loved the Tim Burton version, especially the Prince soundtrack. The colours and sound made it funky.<br /><br />The background info on how Bruce took on the bat persona made it interesting, and how he didn't get the mandatory girl, kept his dark, brooding character more believable. I had the surround sound system pumping--the batmobile sounded awesome. Highly recommended.<br /><br />SPOILER: If the weapon was designed to vaporise water, thus spreading the poison, why weren't all the people zapped as well? After all, aren't we made up of 90% water? Just a thought.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is a fantastic musical. It has a rather traditional structure, and is based on an original novel. It has huge popular appeal, and is at turns heartbreaking and bitingly witty, with knowing references and social critique. It is also refreshing to see Elphaba portrayed not so much as out and out wicked, as misunderstood. <br /> <br />It's such a pity we will probably never see a production in this country.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I had so feared to hear no more from my favourite band. It's a masterpiece. Pure Depeche Mode, but perfectly suited to 2005. Martin's mind-bending synth is a perfect fit, and Dave's vocals are pristine. This release has something for everyone-a touch of vintage, a little of the more recent albums, yet with a sense that this is who they are NOW: In a class unto themselves, never better. Well done!

B00007G1ZC|5.0|Set in the latter part of his career, Akira Kurosawa's \\"Dreams\\" is a film made for sake of cinema. Only pure image,just pure sound. Movements of caracthers within the frame, the pace between shots, scenes and sequences is in such a way as to provide means of artistic contemplation. A testemony to the collective cinematic memory, this film ranks in the higher ends of cinema as an art form. A look should be done to the sequence dealing with a dream about Vincent Van Gogh. I believe we see here a perfect marriage between Painting an Cinema, as the warm pallette of the Dutch is superbely drawn upon the big screen. The pace is slow, all is there to be seen. An extraordinary film
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Ok, well I do think that \\"Mer de norms\\" is slightly better, this album more than shows the brilliance that is APC. \\"Weak and powerless\\" is not only the best track on this album but is one of the best songs ever produced IMHO. \\"Gravity\\" is also another winner on this album, just haunting and a joy to listen to. APC latest album \\"Emotive\\" was purely politiacally driven and flat out not very good. It's sad because people expect much better from APC especially after this album. As time goes on this album simply does not get old, just better and better. Now the anticipation is for the next Tool album. I for one, cannot wait.
B0006L16N8|2.0|That title is from the old Neil Young/Crazy Horse album, but it pretty much describes the effort here in comparison to Coldplay's first two products. I agree with others that it doesn't amaze or move me. The music is somewhat flat and seemingly uninspired. The lyrics are often weak and haven't got that catchy phrasology of the previous releases. I will continue to listen in hopes to appreciate it more in time. Some releases grow on you the more you listen. Even the Greatest Bands of all time have had bumps in the road. The key is, Can Coldplay overcome this with another stellar performance?

B00005OMTT|5.0|Sugary.  Warm.  Sensual.  Absolutely stunning and by far one of the best greatest hits packages released in recent years, Enigma's \\"Love, Sensuality, Devotion\\" is beautifully constructed.  Following Enigma's classic tradition of blending songs together seamlessly, this entire album shifts gracefully from one track to the next.  Nearly every track is emotionally moving, intense, introspective and rich with melodic orchestrations.      Something about this album struck a chord with me from the very first moment I began my long trek through the impressive track list.  I actually purchased \\"L.S.D.\\" well after its release date.  Initially, the only songs I had heard from Enigma were the infamous hits \\"Return To Innocence\\" and \\"Sadeness (Part 1)\\".  For years, I had heard nothing about Enigma.  I wasn't even sure if they still existed.  After buying \\"L.S.D.\\" out on a whim while browsing the racks, I came to find that not only is Enigma alive and well, but the `group' mainly consists of almost entirely one man, Michael Cretu.  In fact, Enigma isn't even a band or a group, but rather a `project'.  `Enigma' is a Greek word, translating into the word `riddle' in English.    Many different artists have worked with Michael Cretu to create the gorgeous musical arrangements heard throughout this greatest hits album.  There is nothing dull or filler included: every song has its place, and leaves a mark in ones heart and mind.  Moving and inspirational, I like to call this the `ultimate truth' album.  You can really find yourself in this music.    \\"Turn Around\\": The opening sequence titled \\"The Landing\\" opens wide into this catchy and groundbreaking new track.  The tribal percussion, rich chords and vocoded vocals bring a whole new meaning to new age music.  Throughout the track, Michael Cretu's wife Sandra (whom we often hear in many of the songs) whispers different titles of some of Enigma's best tunes.  She has a distinctly soft and sensual tone.  A pan flute can be heard, occasionally moving up and down the scale.  Beautifully executed and divinely mixed, I tend to repeat this track at least once. 6/5*    \\"Gravity of Love\\" (from \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\"): Samples from the dark and impressive opera Carmina Burana are often used in this track, which is one of my favorites off the entire album.  The artist Ruth Ann, who has a beautiful commanding voice, performs the lead vocals: her tone perfectly compliments the portions of the opera heard throughout this track.  The electric guitar (heard in the bridge), extremely powerful drums and rich choral voices are breathtaking.  Also worth noting is the meaning behind the lyrics in this song.  Many of Enigma's tunes have a philosophical background, or are based on Faith and love.  This song is no exception, and is one of the most profound and deeply moving lyrical creations I've heard in a long while.  It leaves me breathless every time: just beautiful. 6/5    \\"T.N.T. For The Brain\\" (from \\"Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!\\"): What a great title!  It's just perfect for the mind-blowing experience that most of us deal with at one time or another, that being the extreme intensity of love and/or lust.  This is one of the many sensual and intriguingly suggestive songs on \\"L.S.D.\\".  Hand drums, a magical sitar-like instrument, and middle-eastern flavored strings make this track a very enjoyable listen.  As the song continues, plucking strings join the ensemble, accompanied by the intense breathing and heavy sighs of Sandra.  Adding to the flavor of the track, an electric guitar has its own solo arrangement.  This particular arrangement of this song is actually a remix, and though it's spectacular, it's quite long and somewhat repetitive. 6/5    \\"Modern Crusaders\\" (from \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\"): Again sampling Carmina Burana, this is similar to \\"Gravity of Love\\", but possesses a more aggressive and demanding quality: it isn't nearly as reflective or easygoing.  Much more bold and opinionated, Andru Donalds sings the lead vocals with gusto and conviction.  Strictly about standing up for what you believe in and being strong in your beliefs, this song has an impressive guitar solo in the bridge section, followed by a softer section including nearly whispered vocals from Carmina Burana, which then burst out once again to carry the listener back into the commanding beats.  The end of the song is fantastic, with a spooky church organ on the last note. 6/5    \\"Shadows In Silence\\" (from \\"Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!\\"): Strictly an instrumental piece with echoing pianos, light airy percussion, gently sweeping chords and some very muted vocals soaring in the background, this is a piece one might hear in a massage parlor.  Everything about it is relaxing and soft, even sweet.  Though it's repetitive and there isn't a particularly climactic moment to be found, this song is entirely complete and leaves you feeling very content. 5/5    \\"Return To Innocence\\" (from \\"The Cross of Changes\\"): I shouldn't have to describe this song: everyone and their dog has heard it.  But just in case you've missed out, this is the biggest hit Enigma has ever had, with Tai chanting, strong drumbeats, intense chords, fluttering flutes, underwater sound effects, outer space blips, etc.  There is a reason this song was so well received and loved worldwide: it has every element that makes a song great.  It's simple, passionate, and it just begs to be turned up loud.  This song stands for everything Enigma has always tried to convey.  It's very peaceful and insightful, full of positive energy and encouragement.  The entrancing vocals are provided by Angel X (Andreas Harde). 6/5    \\"I Love You...I'll Kill You\\" (from \\"The Cross of Changes\\"): This is a fascinating song.  It's very long, but very intense from start to finish.  Noteworthy portions are the electric guitar solo, Sandra's spookily whispered vocals and the electronic bagpipe instrument echoing throughout.  Michael Cretu's own vocals can be heard shouting in the background as well.  Primarily an instrumental tune, it creeps and crawls along as it steadily builds to a heightened intensity several minutes later.  Enigma's infamous formula of rich backing chords and strong drums once again works wonders. 5/5    \\"Principles of Lust\\" (from \\"MXMCX a.D.\\"): Enigma's first album is considered by many to be the best of all Enigma albums.  This is the first track in which we hear the distinct sound of that album.  Jazzier beats, a sensually played flute and brass instruments balance this tune.  Sandra whispers `the principles of lust' to the listener, and honestly, this is the single most suggestive song on this album.  However, it's tastefully done, and I particularly enjoy the electronic percussion sounds.  In the middle of the song, Gregorian chanting appears, also another trademark of Enigma's first album.  Sandra sighs heavily repeatedly at the end, but it's far more beautiful than anything Janet Jackson ever did (no offense). 5/5    \\"Sadeness (Part 1)\\" (from \\"MCMXC a.D.\\"): Enigma's other huge hit, this song is still innovative and intriguing to listen to.  The musical style is very much the same as the previous track, but this song focuses more on the Gregorian chants, sparkly chimes and more airy synthesizer effects.  The concept of this song is along the lines of Madonna's hit \\"Erotica\\": it goes along with the pleasure and pain theories.  Still, the song is warm and inviting and is considered by many to be Enigma's most romantic song.  It is executed beautifully, and hearing the chime arpeggios always makes me think of dripping water. 6/5    \\"Silence Must Be Heard\\" (from \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\"): With water percussion echoes (as I like to call them), this tune opens beautifully and adopts the same intense vibe heard from previous tracks \\"Gravity of Love\\" and \\"Modern Crusaders\\".  It's a little more subdued, but no less insightful.  Ruth Ann's vocals are a pleasure to the ears once again.  This track is one of my least favorites on the album and I find it to be a tad (dare I saw it) dull compared to most of the other songs.  However, it makes a bold statement and the song itself is very well done. 5/5    \\"Smell Of Desire\\" (from \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\"): Several different flutes carry this tune along steadily, and though it's mostly instrumental, operatic chants occasionally peak in from the background.  As with other songs from \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\", an electric guitar makes an appearance.  This is a very mysterious song with a whimsical quality.  It's quite entrancing with its pulsing electronic beeps. 5/5    \\"Mea Culpa\\" (from \\"MCMXC a.D.\\"): This sounds a bit like a hybrid of \\"Return To Innocence\\" and \\"Sadeness\\", without the Tai chanting.  The beat is stronger and more aggressive, but the gorgeous flute and Gregorian chants still remain.  The general pace of this song is much faster than most others here; it sounds like something you could listen to while driving an open freeway in the desert.  Sandra's French whispers are particularly lovely. 5/5    \\"Push The Limits\\" (from \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\"): The marching drumbeats of the previous track slowly fade out, and the spooky plucking of this song takes over.  This impressed me greatly from the very beginning.  The keyboards and drumbeats are absolutely perfect, and the syncopated clapping effects add a whole new dimension of intensity.  Operatic singing can be heard behind the faded flute effects.  Sandra once again whispers intriguing and thoughtful expressions.  The end of this song is a crowning achievement of music: I can't seem to get enough of it.  The beat remains commanding, while the sensitivity of the strings balances the act.  My only complaint is that this song simply isn't long enough. 6/5    \\"Beyond The Invisible\\" (from \\"Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!\\"): This is where the album begins to wind down a bit.  Michael Cretu himself provides the lead vocals.  The beats in this song are very muted, which allows the rich chords and vocal chanting to take center stage.  In the middle of the track, a male operatic singer appears, though I'm unsure as to whom it actually is.  It sounds a bit like Josh Groban, though I'm sure it's not him.  Despite how beautiful this song is, it's one of my least favorites from the album. 5/5    \\"Age Of Loneliness\\" (from \\"The Cross of Changes\\"): Michael Cretu lends his voice to this track, which makes for an interesting listen.  He sings particularly high, which impresses.  Sandra also accompanies her husband with her usual wise advice provided no louder than a whisper.  I am reminded of \\"Silence Must Be Heard\\" when I hear this. 5/5    \\"Morphing Thru Time\\" (from \\"Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!\\"): Very slow, melodic and subdued, I adore this song.  There's something captivating about it; something mysterious and inviting.  Many layers of singing and chanting are echoed to the max.  Without more than a hand drum for percussion, the melodies dominate.  Michael's voice is once again present, this time providing an extremely haunting quality to the song.  Everything about this track is divine, but the immaculate voices heard throughout deserve the most praise.  The operatic singing is simply gorgeous, and there are many moments that catch the listener's attention.  This is just fabulous. 6/5    \\"The Cross Of Changes\\" (from \\"The Cross of Changes\\"): A delicate piano and light wispy chords are what impact the listener most here.  Sandra speaks extremely encouraging lyrics.  This is the perfect closure for \\"L.S.D.\\", as it's somewhat short and it makes a beautiful impression.  There's a general effect created of flying or falling gracefully when one listens to this: it makes you feel content. 6/5    This is an album I constantly come back to for encouragement and relaxation.  It never ceases to amaze and astound listeners.  Music lovers absolutely have to have this collection of hits.  Enigma's formula continues to evolvewith every album, but each album is consistently great.  Since the release of \\"L.S.D.\\", Enigma's \\"Voyageur\\" hit the market in 2003, and another album is already in the works.  Perhaps after several more new projects, we can expect to see another great collection of Enigma hits, hopefully even better than \\"L.S.D.\\" (if that's possible).      *6/5 reflects an absolutely outstanding piece of work
B000002GJH|5.0|I was browsing through my CDs the other day when I stumbled upon this nearly forgotten album. I bought it one day at a used CD store. I decided to give it a try because I was in a Chris Cornell mood that day. I took it home and loved it. For some reason, I didn't listen to it very much after that. <br /> <br />Well, upon this recent listen, I have come to realize that I still love this album. The guitars on it are awesome. Gossard shows off his amazing abilities once again. And Cornell's voice is another powerhouse. If you are a fan of his ability to hold a note for what seem like forever, you will love this album. <br /> <br />
B0000027RL|3.0|This is pretty good, but at times, it's so friggin boring! Nevermind, Superunknown and Dirt are better.
B00005JNJV|4.0|One cannot fault the cinematography in this film, it's a work of art. And they got the atmosphere right, and added some emotional depth to Batman's backstory. But: the dialog was aimed at the lowest common denominator (and mixed so poorly that sometimes I had to listen to it 3 or 4 times to understand it); the action was so chopped up that it was hard to tell who was who and what was happening; the ethics became a little murky as Batman crunches and crashes dozens of police cars; and the proceedings become way too illogical as: 1) Batman dangles by a cable from a speeding monorail L train as it passes through multiple trestles (how do you do that?); 2) some kind of giant microwave projector is employed to boil the city water supply - that would be some nasty steam, wouldn't it? and wouldn't all water-containing items such as people, etc. be affected as well? Ultimately I ended up constantly making a comparison to Spider-man 2, which also featured a train scene. Nowhere in SW2 was I taken out of the movie by baffling logic gaps; those film-makers had the sense to run their story through an adult-level logic check, whereas these guys obviously didn't. How could Ra's (who is tough but can in no way be as high-tech-equipped) be beating the hell out of Batman who is wearing kevlar and graphite armor? This movie was really good where it stayed small, a scale which the writers could handle. They just don't have the intellect to write \\"big.\\" Maybe it takes a committee. Anyway, this is entertaining, even beautiful to watch, but the last 45 minutes or so is way over the top and nonsensical.
0767817729|5.0|This movie has it all. It's by far that this is my favorite movie. I have bought it three times, but loaned it out. So, now I have the DVD and I will not loan this one out. If it seems long or slow, just hang in there cause it only gets better.
B00005JNQA|2.0|This movie reminded me of another clunker, \\"Proof of Life\\".  Much like that film, here we have two popular actors (it had Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan) with good acting skills who find themselves with no real material to work with.  This movie is much more predictable than that one, and is very improbable.  While \\"The Interpreter\\" has some action, most of it will leave you yelling at the characters on the screen to do the obvious thing, but they never do. <br /> <br />The movie has Sean Penn as a grieving agent while Nicole Kidman is an interpreter who overhears part of an assassination plot.  When she brings this to the authorities, Sean Penn doesn't believe her and tells her why her story is completely improbable.  This is the most realistic part of the film.  Unfortunately, the film makers never explain the holes in the script made obvious by Sean's character. Then he later decides to completely believe her, even though she keeps lying to him and he keeps finding out more about her throughout the movie.  Yet, he only believes her more and more; it gets ridiculous.  Sean Penn is a very talented actor, so I'm sure if we listen carefully we can hear him punching his agent in the face repeatedly for getting him this gig. <br /> <br />Although you find yourself liking Sean Penn's character a little, Nicole Kidman's character is very unlikable. <br /> <br />Save yourself some time, watch the trailer and figure out the rest of the film in about 5 minutes.  I like Nicole Kidman and I hope this film doesn't hurt her career too much.
B00000JLWW|3.0|The highest grossing movie of all time, James Cameron's Titanic follows the love story of Jack and Rose set on the doomed 1912 maiden voyage of the Titanic.  It is a real tear-jerker and very moving on many levels.  However, anyone who takes love-life advice from this movie is in for big trouble. <br /> <br />In the movie, Rose is supposedly \\"redeemed\\" by Jack--he not only saved her life but also freed her from a tyrannical mother and fiance (her father is dead) and enabled her through a brief love affair to go on to lead a fulfilling and whole life, riding horses and flying airplanes. <br /> <br />Sorry to burst the bubble, but this rarely happens in real life.  Father-absent girls aren't helped to live a full life through the temporary attention of a sporadic nomad figure like Jack.  What is needed is the consistent love of a father figure to give a sense of worthiness and security to face the world (cf. Bowlby).  In the real world, Rose's love affair with Jack would not have helped her escape her bad situation.  She would probably have been too insecure to leave her situation and would have come crawling back.  Otherwise she would have escaped to 1912 America and most likely fallen into a life of poverty, e.g. prostitution.  And let's get real--if Jack had survived, do you think he would have given up his responsibility-free artist life to feed babies?  I doubt it. <br /> <br />James Cameron also tries to make Jack into a pseudo-Christ figure, presumably to take the place of a dead father/God.  But the same argument holds here: a vagabond come-and-go lover can't take the place of a loving Daddy/God to take care of you and give you the strength to overcome tyranny. <br />
B000AU9UYM|5.0|In the music industry, super-groups are well reviewed and tend to top the charts. Super-groups are, in case you weren't aware, when members from one band and members from another band merge together to form a new band. Velvet Revolver, Audioslave, and A Perfect Circle are examples of that. With movies, you rarely see two filmmakers put their heads together and create something really good. With \\"Batman Begins\\" that's what you get. <br />You have the writer/director of \\"Memento\\" and the writer of the 3 movies in the \\"Blade\\" trilogy. That's a smart pairing up and it didn't go to waste. \\"Batman Begins\\" is a wonderful film, in many ways. As a comic book adaptation, as pure entertainment, the art direction and cinematography are great and the cast is unbeatable. Going back to the previous 4 Batman movies, there are several things that are wrong with them. The first two Batman movies (Batman & Batman Returns) were directed by Tim Burton and had Michael Keaton as the masked man. The films had a very gothic, creepy feeling to them; but Michael Keaton couldn't really pull of tough. Don't get me wrong, I love both of those films though. Joel Schumacher took over directing for the next two films (Batman Forever & Batman and Robin) and took a different approach. Those films were more like cartoonish black comedies; and the actors that were chosen to play Batman weren't that great either. Val Kilmer was too serious, George Clooney was too charismatic. Both are great actors and again, I enjoyed both films...But, I don't know. This film is more of an action film/drama that has a serious tone to it. It's dark, but not really gothic. We also have our protagonist Batman being like the comic book character. He's a reserved, reclusive billionaire instead of a womanizing, charming, billionaire. The film doesn't have your typical Batman feel to it, either...I'll explain. First of all, Batman doesn't appear in the film (by that I mean Bruce Wayne donning the cape) until 61 minutes in. Infact, most of the first half of the movie takes place in Japan or somewhere simalar and feels like \\"The Last Samurai.\\" Ironically, a star from that film appears in this movie as well. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, who hits all the right notes) is in a prison in Japan or China (I get confused) when a man named Ducard (Liam Neeson) gets him out and begins training him, so Bruce can join The League of Shadows; an elite team of heavily trained ninjas that is run by a man named Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe, 'The Last Samurai'). After passing all the tests and realizing that The League isn't for him, he leaves the place in ruins and returns to his home in Gotham City. Gotham City is a crime ridden town, that's run by a mafia boss (Tom Wilkinson) and Bruce feels it's up to him to fix things. It's a perfect cover too, because everyone in Gotham is under the impression that Bruce is dead. <br />So, with the help of his trusty butler Alfred (Michael Caine, who replaces Pat Hingle who played Alfred in all four films), an employee of Wayne Enterprises named Lucius Fox (a wonderful Morgan Freeman), a semi-love interest named Rachel (Katie Holmes), and Detective Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman); Bruce takes crime fighting into his own hands. Cillian Murphy ('Red Eye') plays the main-villain, who turns out to not even be the \\"head villain guy\\" Scarecrow. Oddly enough, Murphy seems to be blending both the roles he played in \\"Breakfast on Pluto\\" and \\"Red Eye\\" for this role. The character he plays is very flamboyant, but maintains a cold icy stare. Anyway, the cinematography and art direction are absolutely wonderful. This is the best looking Gotham City we've seen on the screen yet. The dialogue is really good; Everything looks different. And the movie is done in a serious way. Nothing cartoonish about this. Everyone plays their roles to perfection; <br />Bale proves his versatilty, Caine and Freeman are wonderful to watch, Gary Oldman is like a chameleon blending into his role. I also like how they bring in a female character (Rachel) as a potential love interest, but nothing comes of it. It really does justice to Batman. Anyway, despite what Ebert & Roeper said, I don't think this was one of the best films of 2005. I think it was the best comic-book based film of 2005 and I think it's the best Batman movie so far; but that's because none of the other ones are taken seriously. Spiderman is a semi-dramatic comedic action film. X-Men are action films. <br />Fantastic Four was a comedy. It's a nice break; Fans of the comics or fans of writer/director Christopher Nolan should be pleased. <br /> <br />GRADE: A- <br />
1401308201|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of Wicked the musical and couldn't wait for this book to come out. When I finally got it, I was blown away by how cool the cover looked and at all the behind-the-scenes info (including the interviews with all the women who've played Elphaba). If you're getting the book for information on the genesis and success of the musical you can't do much better than this book. Unfortunately, there were hardly any new pictures, backstage or during the show, here to see. You could pretty much find any of them with ten minutes on Google, and with such a visually beautiful show as Wicked that was a major letdown for me. Also, the reviewer below is right- there is not a complete libretto here. Still, the design and production of The Grimmerie is very well done, but it just could have used a lot more rare pictures.
B000001ES9|5.0|I hate how people here keep dissing Neil Peart, saying his lyrics are pretentious and stupid. Whatever, he's the best drummer in the world and is a terrific lyricist. Anyway, this is Rush's first album featuring bassist/singer Geddy Lee, guitarist <br />Alex Lifeson, and drummer John Rutsey. On this album, all the lyrics were written by Geddy Lee and music by Alex Lifeson. This album's most popular song is probably \\"Working Man\\", which is a great song but is not the best on the album. Here's the tracks: <br />1. Finding My Way-5/5-Even though it's absent both Neil Peart's drumming and lyrics this is one of my favorite Rush songs. <br />2. Need Some Love-5/5-Good song; the lyrics are kind of cheesy. They pretty different from lyrics Geddy Lee would write years later for his solo album \\"My Favorite Headache.\\" <br />3. Take a Friend-4/5-Beat is pretty good; the song is good overall. The lyrics  bother me. (Take a friend whether woman or man...?) <br />4. Here Again-3/5-I don't really dislike this song or anything...But it's seven minutes long and there's really no point for it being that long. It doesn't show off anything lyrically, vocally, or anything else. <br />5. What You're Doing-5/5-Guitars in this song are great, drums aren't bad either <br />6. In the Mood-5/5-Love this song. The lyrics are funny (in a good way). <br />7. Before and After-5/5-I think Lee's voice sounds awesome in this song. <br />8. Working Man-5/5-Probably the best known song off this album. It's a great song, lyrics are pretty plain though.  <br />A-
B00006LLNU|5.0|This album is amazing.  No words in the English language can come close to the haunting way () leaves you, which is why the harmonic voice of Jonsi is so effective.  Singing in made up \\"Hopelandic,\\" he captures the essence of what music truly is, an expression of the deepest of inner emotion, and what better a way to express those feelings that can't be explained in a language with no meaning.  These songs are left up to the listener's interpretation, leaving the listener in a truly tripped out state at the end of each session.  If there happens to be a fizzled out roach sitting on the coffee table in front of you, and you awake from a daze with Sigur Ros playing in the background, it's a safe assumption that you have been in another dimension for the better part of a decade and that there are cars that can fly outside of your house.
B000002HRE|4.0|I can't say that its a fact, I believe that many things led to the downfall of Metallica, and it starts a long time ago when Cliff died in 1986.<br /><br />Ever since then the group has searched for identity. They found it in 1988 with JIZZY NEWSTED and they found it in 1991 with BOB ROCK.<br /><br />This guy gave them a smash production in 1991 that was different from the METALLICA of the eighties. However this album was still popular with fans; including me. However BOB ROCK wore out his welcome all to easily in his next production LOAD. Where was the metal? Even the bands trademark name plate had been subdued on this one. What was with this title anyway? With the cover art containing a mixture of certain male and female bodily fluids, WHAT THE HELL?<br /><br />By 1997 when RELOAD came out it wasn't as much of a shock to the system. I enjoyed some of the non-metallic songs on this peice (even Unforgiven II isn't so bad, and I do like LOW MANS LYRIC alot...)  We were told it was the second half to what was supposed to be a double album. Thank you Bob Rock, you brainwarped a great band.<br /><br />I guess there are a few goods on LOAD and RELOAD, oh well what can you do. If they had just made it one album......<br /><br />ANYWAY... No matter how much the people complained, the band changed NOTHING, in fact have gotten progressively worse, while releasing a good song here and there... New bassist RANDY TRAJILLY(guarantee he doesn't see another record) and the same producer, BOB ROCK> why? Rumour has it, they want HIM to play bass on the next album.<br /><br />you should look up the on line petition that I just discovered, its actually there to ensure that Bob Rock and Metallica  go their seperate ways. THIS should ultimately be their own choice, but come on, maybe we can get through those thick skulls and take them back to the roots. Maybe.<br /><br />I figure that we should just let them be a memory in their essential eighties albums, and hope for the best with the new metali-group.
0451167716|5.0|It was around the Summer of 2004 when I first decided to pick this book up and read it. And once I did start to read it, I was literally possessed by it, and finished it very soon after.  <br /> <br />It was just another plain, boring day of Summer for me, while the other kids went to the beach, the mall, the movies, had fun with their friends, while I was stranded home with nothing better to do with my time. Well, it was just like that after I had finished my term of Summer School--I mean had something to do, somewhere to go, something to occupy my time when I was in Summer School--but afterwards I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do for the next month and some weeks left of Summer. What was I to do? Just sleep, and watch TV, go on the computer, and moap around? That was all I did, wasting my time, until one day I was walking around in my sisters room and happened to catch a glimpse of her books on her bookshelf. There was one particular one that caught my eye right away. The side said \\"The Godfather.\\" I knew that was a movie--a classic movie--but I did never know it was originally a book.  <br />    So, I decided to read it. I sat on her computer chair, and read the first few sentences in the book: \\"Amerigo Bonasera sat in New York Criminal Court Number 3...\\" and from then on I was instantly hooked, like a person hooked on heroin or crack/cocaine or crystal meth, whichever.  <br />Normally, I absolutely HATED reading in the first place---but I don't know why I decided to start reading that book one day--maybe from the complete boredom, yeah. And once I finished that book, I said to myself 'Wow' 'I never knew books were so fun', and from then on I wanted to read more books. I was a pretty avid reader then. <br />But anyways, enough about my experiences with the book. <br />And more onto the book. <br />The last time I read this is a year or so ago(but I will certainly re-read it soon)so my memory is not too clear on it. But I shall try my best. <br />'TheGodfather' is a clear, very realistic and insightful view of the Mafia underworld---all mainly circling around 'The Corleone family' and their pursuits with other families of crime. Well, that's basically it. My memory is hazy so whatever. If u don't get and read this book ur truly missing out on the best crime book in all of the Universe.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Depeche Mode, Playing the Angel<br />Playing The Angel takes me back to Sunday Goth Nights, clove cigarettes, black eyeliner, and cheap rum drinks. Depeche Mode's 11th album has a slick production, a captive flow from beginning to end, and supremacy to prior albums with its added instrumentation, sound effects, constant beats and rhythms, and heavy, heavy bass. Its sexy music to make out to, play as ambiance, or just dance your face off to.
B00008LDPU|3.0|The Matrix alone was a very confusing film. Had it not been for its visuals it probably would have failed. Who actually remembers what the characters in this movie said (Whoa!)? I don't, but I definately remember the float kick.<br /><br />And then it was announced that two and three were coming out, and I figured the world would be explained a little better. It was, but never to a satisfying extent. In fact, I still remember watching the final movie with a friend and seeing his perplexed look as the credits rolled near.<br /><br />Luckily, I had seen Animatrix before hand, and I knew a great deal more about the movies because of it. In fact, without the Animatrix, I would have been too lost to really care about the second or third movies. Hell, the second movie starts as an epilogue to one of the short films in the Animatrix. And the character of Kid that adores Neo and jumps into a mech in the third film would have seemingly came out of nowhere to those who haven't seen the Animatrix, where he is introduced more thoroughly as a bored kid with a propensity for doing what is needed.<br /><br />The Animatrix also explains the history of the Matrix in two shorts that unfold in documentary form. After watching this, you understand why the machines are so hostile to humanity in the Matrix films. Other shorts explore some of the attributes of the Matrix, going as far as explaining how a haunted house is made. Without this we'd be lost inside the world of the Matrix films.<br /><br />But it's not perfect. At least two of the stories have little relevance to the actual world of the Matrix (though they are still great to watch). The shorts are maybe too short. The quick ten minute films are often a bit jarring, as you're forced into them and back out rather quickly. To add to that, there seems to be too much experimentation in the animation. One is done in what looks to be pencil sketches, one is exaggerated with strange camera angles, another is entirely black and white, and the last film has drug-haze coloring that I still can't stand to watch.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to true anime fans and to Matrix lovers.white, and the last film has drug-haze coloring that I still can't stand to watch. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie to true anime fans and to Matrix lovers.
0743201140|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my boss - partly because he knew I would be open minded enough to do something with the information and he strives for the kind of work environment that cultivates one's strengths (I am lucky!).  <br /> <br />The authors do a great job of explaining why people are the way they are and that it is no accident.  I have spent way too much time working on my known weaknesses with very little result except providing damage control - now I understand why.  I have literally changed they way I think about myself since reading this excellent book.  Also, please take the StrengthsFinder profile on the web site - but be open minded and gentle on yourself when the results put you in categories that you do not see in yourself!   <br />
B000AU9UYM|4.0|Batman and Batman Returns were easily the best two of the first four films. They had everything the darker comic books had, including the deep atmosphere and an anti-hero Batman character. For a long time after the release of the third (Batman Forever) and fourth (Batman & Robin) I feared for the future of what had been a great movie franchise. So, when Batman Begins came out, I was determined not to waste the same amount of time as I did with Forever and Batman & Robin.<br /><br />Luckily, I changed my mind. Batman Begins has gone back (without Keaton) to its darker roots, capturing the haunting, crime-ridden atmosphere made great in the first two films. Not only that, but it left behind all those childish moments in Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.<br /><br />Though certainly not Michael Keaton's Batman, Christian Bale brings to us a new Batman, one hell bent (at least at first) on succeeding where he had past failed, and one facing many new obstacles in his career. When he's in constume, Bale delivers convincely as a menacing crime-fighter. Definately better than Clooney or Kilmer. To add, the villains in this film are far more convincing than even those in the first two films.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie for anyone who is enjoying the current flood of superhero films, or for those of you who still had hope left for the Batman movies. A great movie sure to promise greater sequals (I HOPE).<br /><br />As for the DVD, I highly recommend the Deluxe Edition, as it contains a second disc filled with interesting documentaries along with a small graphic novel of past Batman adventures. A must have for true fans.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|So good to have new DM music, particularly since their last effort, Exciter, wasn't very exciting. Much of the sound of Playing the Angel is reminiscent of the early days, with tracks 1 through 5 coming in very strong. A few songs kind of sputter out at the end rather than coming to a definite conclusion. Suffer Well is very good, a reincarnation of Behind The Wheel, and Precious is pure DM. Many of the songs grind and churn in true industrial fashion and Dave's voice, as always, is excellent, the perfect compliment to the dark music. The second half of the disc gets a bit weaker. After listening to PTA, I played a string of some of my all time favorite DM songs like Never Let Me Down Again, Policy of Truth, Enjoy The Silence, In Your Room, Walking In My Shoes, It's No Good, Personal Jesus, Rush, Behind The Wheel and Everything Counts and realized that the overwhelming grandeur and magic of those songs seems to be missing here. Nevertheless, I think the new disc is very good indeed and sure to get better with repeated listenings. It's so good to have new music for the masses!
0316172324|4.0|We are laden with too much information and many of us have the mistaken assumption that the best way to work with all of this information is through careful, detailed, analysis. Malcom gives us a wake-up call. Our mind is a pattern machine that is capable of making quick jumps and accurate conclusions with very little information. The book's premise and assertions are its strength. The writing is engaging but the packaging a bit too commercial and in some spots faulty. If you have to make a quick decision - I say buy the book and read it - just use it as a starting point to conduct your own observations of how to make quick decisions and be more intuitive.
0679422714|1.0|Of all my recent book purchases in Hong Kong, this was the one I most highly anticipated. It is impossible to understand modern China without dealing with the life and legacy of Mao Zedong. In fact, up until about five years ago I would have argued that Mao was the most important Chinese of the 20th Century. Now I believe Deng Xiaoping is the rightful heir of that mantle, having clearly passed by Mao, leaving him an (increasingly) distant second. Still, Mao retains an almost demigod status in the consciousness of many Chinese born before his death in 1976. Thus, adequately explaining this extremely complicated figure in the context of his times is a highly important necessity, now that China has re-emerged in a big way on the world stage. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this book is a supreme disappointment. Full disclosure: I knew going in that Jung Chang would not be friendly towards Mao. I have no problem with that; a biographer is not required to like her subject. It is common knowledge, for instance, that Stephen Ambrose abhorred Richard Nixon. However, a biographer owes it to her subject, and most of all to her readers, to present an objective account of the person's life (as Ambrose achieved). In this, the authors fail utterly. They present a one-dimensional picture of an enormously complex life, and readers could be forgiven if they came away from the book believing Mao was Lucifer incarnate. It is bad history, shoddily written, poorly edited, with a story that moves along in an agonized, plodding manner. <br /> <br />In this book, Mao appears more as caricature than human being, and the central thesis of the authors seems to be that Mao `meaned' his way to the top, being a man without a single redeeming quality. Mao's personal physician, Li Zhisui, wrote a tell-all book about his infamous patient, The Private Life of Chairman Mao, that portrays a more realistic, interesting picture of the Chairman, warts and all. Li makes no secret of the fact that he believedMao was a despot, but even he acknowledged Mao's contributions to the Revolution, and what's more, he presented Mao as a believable human being. Jung and Halliday would have us believe the Revolution succeeded in spite of Mao. <br /> <br />The authors draw several questionable conclusions in their attempt to shatter the Mao myth. For instance, they argue that Mao was merely a stooge of Stalin, and that Moscow, which had backed him all along, basically installed him to run the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). They also contend that practically every CCP leader despised Mao. This doesn't stand to reason. First of all, in the days before Mao's rise to the top, the CCP disciplined Mao on several occasions precisely because he often used passive aggressive tactics to avoid carrying out CCP directives (from Moscow) because he believed these were unsuitable for conditions in China. Second, if all Moscow desired was a bootlicking sycophant that fawned over every new directive from the Kremlin, there were several other candidates it would have chosen (in fact, did choose), including those who had actually lived in Moscow. Why would Stalin choose someone like Mao to head the CCP who had a demonstrated history of opposition to Moscow, and (if the authors are correct) was such an unpopular figure in his own party? <br /> <br />In their attempts to demonize their subject, the authors make the fatal error of propping up his opponents. In particular, they give kid glove treatment to Chiang Kai-shek, glossing over his own brutality and incompetence and the atrocities of the Nationalist government; for instance, in their account, the 1927 Shanghai White Terror purge on April 12 resulted in the deaths of `some' trade union leaders and `probably' more than 300 communists. They neglect to inform the reader that the actual number of dead in the city approached 40,000 and the criminal gangs allied with Chiang sold the wives and daughters of slain workers by the thousands into the city's teeming brothels. Throughout the book they continually explain away Chiang's shortcomings, failures and disastrous generalship as due to the treachery or ineptitude of others. His coterie was comprised of moles, secret agents, or outright traitors. Without a shred of hard evidence, they allege that one of Chiang's most trusted generals, Hu Zongnan, was a Moscow agent, who deliberately lost scores of key battles to the CCP. Yet he inexplicably accompanied Chiang to Taiwan in 1949 and remained there the rest of his life. Their most unique assertion is that Chiang intentionally held back and permitted the CCP to escape to north China during the Long March, because of a secret deal he made with the Russians to guarantee the safety of his only son Chiang Ching-kuo, who was living in Russia as an exchange student and worker. Again, they can offer no evidence to back this up, except for the fact that Chiang failed to eliminate the Red Army on the Long March; since he failed to do so, it must be because he had an ulterior motive. With this logic, one wonders what his ulterior motive was in the Civil War of 1947-1949. The authors employ this tactic numerous times throughout the book, claiming that what they are revealing was `secret' at the time and `remains so today'. A mighty convenient way to avoid proving their assertions. <br /> <br />One thing the book does have going for it, is the extensive use of Chinese-language primary and secondary sources. Here again, though, the authors seem to mischaracterize, if not outright distort, key assertions from what information the sources provide that is critical of Mao Zedong. This is true of quoted cites from already published works, which appear to be taken out of context. They then draw sweeping conclusions that are difficult to correlate with the quoted material. Their most explosive tidbits always happen to come from personal interviews; most of these, oddly enough, are informants the authors don't identify (for the sources' ownsafety, the authors claim). Maybe this is true, but the evidentiary value of the assertions suffers as a result. The good thing about the abundance of sources is that an academic who wishes to check the accuracy and context of cites should have no trouble doing so, except of course, for the scores of anonymous interviews. If this is done, it is my conviction that the authors' conclusions and research will not stand up to critical academic scrutiny. I also hope that someone will contact the interviewees that did go public; I suspect they will claim that in many respects that the authors took their views out of context. <br /> <br />In sum: anyone waiting for the definitive biography of Chairman Mao will have to keep waiting. It is undeniable that Mao was a cruel tyrant. However, this book reveals nothing about the man and how he came to be that way. It completely underestimates his genuine abilities and ignores his very real accomplishments, all of which even his sternest Chinese critics and enemies concede. This book is nothing more than a clumsy hatchet job, and will appeal only to those with either no knowledge of modern Chinese history (if they can read through it), or those intent on seeing the CCP as the post-USSR bogeyman. If you really want to read this book, save your money: get a copy from a library, buy it used, or wait until it comes out in paperback.
B000AYEIZY|1.0|Like many, I looked forward to the Royal Albert Hall CD and like many, I was thoroughly disappointed. While it seems from a listening that Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker are primed to \\"rev up\\" Eric Clapton's playing is so uninspired and so careless, the original \\"supergroup\\" never takes off. <br />While I may be criticized as a purist, Clapton's choice of his muddy Stratocaster sound cannot compare with his former Gibson sound - which is what this recording so desperately needs. CREAM stood out because of Clapton's tone - his phrasings on those recordings, 37 years ago. <br />The closest I have seen him come to his original genius lately is on John Mayall's \\"70th Birthday Concert,\\" where Mayall guitarist Buddy Whittingham and Mick Taylor so challenge \\"Slowhand\\" he finally seems to wake up and play.
0224071262|1.0|Of all my recent book purchases in Hong Kong, this was the one I most highly anticipated. It is impossible to understand modern China without dealing with the life and legacy of Mao Zedong. In fact, up until about five years ago I would have argued that Mao was the most important Chinese of the 20th Century. Now I believe Deng Xiaoping is the rightful heir of that mantle, having clearly passed by Mao, leaving him an (increasingly) distant second.

B0000844IT|5.0|This is one of those movies that has been on cable TV so much that I'm pretty sure most everyone has seen some of it.  It's pretty damn silly, obviously, but isn't insultingly stupid like some horror-comedies.  It's always fun, and quite hilarious at times, mainly due to the power house performance from Bruce Campbell.  Most people seem to prefer 'Evil Dead II', and while I think that movie outshines this one in many ways, this one wins out overall due to Campbell's improved work.  Certainly, he had the physical comedy down last time, but Ash's character wasn't fully developed.  He wasn't half the surly blowhard he is here, and pretty much all of the truly classic Ash lines comes from 'Army of Darkness'.  It's too bad they never made an 'Evil Dead IV', and we might have had the best of both worlds. (And everyone is always insisting that there are no current plans to make another 'Evil Dead' film, so it probably ain't gonna happen.  Frankly, I think Bruce is probably too old to play Ash properly anymore.)<br /><br />This movie is pretty much impossible to describe, as it just kinda lurches from one random comic scenario to the next.  It's totally anarchic, and while not every scene works all that well it never gets boring.  It's a feast of intentionally cheesy special effects, with tons of great skeleton puppets and a lotta fun stop-motion animation.  Lotsa people complain about the lack of gore in 'Army of Darkness', but honestly there wasn't any real gore in 'Evil Dead II'.  Plasticky limbs flying around a bit, some spraying green or black paint and not much else.) `Evil Dead II' really wan't much of a gorehound's dream, I'm afraid.  And yeah, the serious horror elements have been reduced to about 0, but they were virtually nonexistent in that movie too.  I don't wanna dump on `Evil Dead II', I like it a lot, but the typical complaints as to why `Army of Darkness' is worse than it literally don't make much sense.  If you loved `Evil Dead II' because it was so gory and horrific, well I gotta lot of other movies you need to see.<br /><br />I've got the Boomstick edition from Anchor Bay.  This has got the Director's Cut and the Theatrical Cut.  Like some other reviewers, I actually think the cut you'll usually see on cable is the best one.  The final battle in the Director's Cut is too drawn out, and they cut some good lines.  Most significantly, the DC ending just isn't 1/100th as awesome as the TC ending. (I'm all for artistic integrity and whatnot, but the studios were right this time.  The TC ending is the best scene in the movie.)  The TC is fine, but it's missing a few cool things. (i.e. a couple of deleted scenes not in either version, but found on the DVD, the large blood spray on the wall, the part where Ash rips the skeleton arm out of the ground and, most significantly, the brief moment were Evil Ash spontaneously starts breathing fire.)  Obviously, it's unreasonable that they'd include a cut assembled by a third party on the DVD, but there's no denying that I like that one best.  Still, the TC is pretty close to optimal, and all that material is found somewhere on the 2 DVDs.  Overall, this is a very good DVD set, as per usual for Anchor Bay.  God, I know I'm gettin off on something irrelevant, but what's with all the idiot's whining about Anchor Bay whenever they release a DVD that is less than perfect.  What, you say that their release of `Tenebre' is missing 20 incosequential seconds of footage because of print damage, and yet they still advertise it as `uncut'.  Thost deceptive scumbags!!!!  Half of the horror movies put out by Anchor Bay would not have a remotely decent DVD release if they weren't around.  But what can I say, some people will complain regardless of what happens.<br /><br />Yeah, this movie is great.  I've seen it at least 10 times by now, but it still holds up very well, something which you might not anticipate with such a film.<br /><br />Grade: A-ific, well I gotta lot of other movies you need to see.

1401308201|5.0|Finally, after months of waiting (and a whole week early!). Wicked: The Grimmerie is here. Some may be wondering if they should buy this book, and I'm here to tell you.    The Good News: The cover and design of the book is amazing. The cover looks old and worn and is even padded. The intricate designs are textured and the book is nice and heavy and thick. The inside design is incredible. Each page (printed on very heavy paper) is made to look old, worn and stained and it's wonderful to look at. As for the actual contents... wow. The production photos are brilliantly printed and include photos from the following casts: Original Broadway Cast, 2nd Broadway Cast (Jennifer Laura Thompson and Joey McIntyre), Original Tour Cast (Stephanie J. Block and Kendra Kassebaum), and the 3rd Broadway Cast (Shoshana Bean and David Ayers). There are very few new photos but there are some. Most of them are from the tour cast (most of Kendra and some of Stephanie and one small one of Carole Kane). There are many interviews with every cast member and many from Gregory Maguire (writer of Wicked the novel) and Stephen Shwartz and Winnie Holtzman (writer of script). There is a step-by-step page of how Stephanie gets green before each show. They have a page dedicated to the dance Elphaba does in \\"Dancing Through Life\\" and they teach it to us step-by-step. They have many photos of props and sets and wigs, as well as original costume and set sketches. There is a handwritten page from the book and an early version of Defying Gravity. There is commentary on each song by Mr. Shwartz and this isn't even all of it. So much information to soak up!    The Wicked News: Unlike what some people are saying, the book DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FULL SCRIPT. There are bits of dialogue and a lot of it is summed up in a few sentences. (The Cornfield Scene is completely gone) They cut whole scenes (which is dumb, they are all spoiler free about it, even though they talk about the same parts in interviews). I was sohoping they would make a huge deal about the script and splash the libretto with tons of photos from each scene... It's very, very disappointing, yes. Very. But... ah, well. They also didn't include Elphaba's spells like they said they would. There is also a sad lack of production photos. There are so many wonderful photos and they don't use NEARLY as much as they should have... You should also know they don't include the 4th Broadway cast (Megan Hilty, Ben Vereen) or ANY of the Chicago cast (Ana Gastyer and Kate Reinders)... that really bites. The Chicago sit-down cast is only mentioned and that is a shame. If you are an Original Cast fan you may be slightly disappointed. Instead of using only the original cast photos (like the RENT \\"bible\\") they mix and match all the different casts. This would be fine except that if you are a big fan or the Chicago cast or the current Broadway cast (as of Fall 2005) you will be disappointed.    But over all, an AMAZING book. Buy it! It's a must for every Wicked fan. A MUST. This is also a wonderful gift.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Great combination of ideas paired with a good set of actors who work well with one another.  I enjoyed this series a great deal and have watched it all the way through twice. <br /> <br />It starts off a little slow, but don't let that fool you, once the chemistry gets going, it doesn't stop, and it only gets better.  Don't forget to see the movie!
B0000646UN|5.0|This movie is about as accurate a depiction of a historical event as you are going to find.  Despite what Mr. Kessel has to say, the portrayals of the Soviet soldiers as \\"cardboard cutouts\\" are authentic.  That is exactly the way the war was fought in Karelia.  The Soviet troops advanced in human waves, utterly indifferent to casualties.  Some Finnish soldiers collapsed from physical and psychological exhaustion after inflicting such horrendous casualties on the Russians in just one day of battle.  There were even instances of Russian soldiers being forced to link arms and set off across mine fields to clear them for the next wave of troops to come through.  As for the Mannerheim Line: Check your facts Sir.  The Mannerheim line did not get breeched until mid-February 1940 after two and a half months of relentless artillery and air bombardment and that with the Finns short of ammunition and anti-tank weapons. <br /> <br />As for the movie itself, a warning to those of you looking for an oscar winning tour de' force (God I hate that term) in the American sense; this movie is not for you.  It is very foreign in its presentation (and music) but that only enhances its authenticity instead of turning it into Enemy at the Gates, e.g.  Its not Englishmen or Yanks playing Russians and Germans but Finns playing Finns and Russians playing Russians. <br /> <br />For military and history buffs who will appreciate the beauty seeing an authentic T-26 tank in action of half-scale models of DB-3's, SB-2's and I-16's making ground attack runs, this movie is a definite must see.
0064471047|4.0|i love reading these books during the cold season. I especially love reading these books.. doesn't matter which one, snuggled under a warm blanket sitting in my rocking chair in front of the fireplace  with of course snacks and hot chocolate. u should try it.. it's fulfilling.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I don't understand all the hype surrounding this album. I mean, its average but from a band that gave us Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head average just isn't good enough. There is one good song on this album - Fix You, although I'm sure it sounds better because of the rubbish you have to listen to before you get to it. The whole album is boring and monotonous and failed to strike a chord with me in the way the previous two albums have done. If you're new to Coldpay then don't bother with this album - A Rush of Blood to the Head is far superior. If you're not new to Coldplay then be warned, X&Y isn't up to much, go spend your money on something better, it won't be hard to find.
B000AARKOO|3.0|To me this felt like an attempt to recreate the sucess of Gladiator.   There were many similarities - the scenes of old Jerusalem were very much like those of Rome (albeit equally spectacular!), the battle scenes were filmed in the same style as those in Gladiator, and the lead character's story was similar.   What was missing was the character development.   Orlando Bloom did a reasonably good job with the lead - he doesn't have quite the gravitas he needs to make the big speeches before a battle, but other than that he did a fine job (and I gotta admit, he looks even better than Russell in those period clothes!).    Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons were both excellent, as usual.   But I never got as emotionally involved with the characters as with Maximus - the story jumps from spectacular scene to spectacular scene without enough tying it all together.   We're clearly supposed to feel some sympathy and respect for Salidin, but that's never justified.   In the end, it leaves you feeling a  bit empty.  Perhaps the 40 minutes that will supposedly be in the \\"director's cut\\" will fill in those blanks.    Ridley, you've got the scenery, costumes and special effects down - next time spend a little more money and effort on the script.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I first heard dcfc when my mate told me to go to their website and listen to them because he thought I'd like them - how right he was!  I went out and bought Plans straight away (probably should have started with the old stuff but hey!) And I haven't stopped listening since. The lyrics and the music are beautiful. The opening \\"Marching Band of Manhattan\\" is stunning and sets the tone for the rest of the album. The best song would have to be \\"What Sarah said\\" it makes me stop what I'm doing and listen whenever I hear it. This album really made me think - about a lot of things. Whatever music you're into, give this a try, its well worth it.
1573223026|3.0|I liked this book, and finished it in about a week.  Each of the characters was interesting, although I didn't feel a close resemblance to any of them (like I did with High Fidelity).  I've read all of Hornby's novels now, and I enjoy the sarcasm and wit he includes in them.  They are definitely well written books, but occasionally the story that unfolds is just not that great. <br /> <br />I hate to reveal much about the plot, because that's been well covered in other reviews.  If you enjoy Hornby's style, you will probably enjoy this book, but if you're just looking for a good Hornby book, start with High Fidelity and expand your horizon as much or as little as you like with his other books.   <br /> <br />I didn't like the way it ended.
B0002OERI0|5.0|For me American Idiot is an astonishingly good album. It shows how far the band have come both musically and lyrically. I have a real issue with people who claim that with American Idiot Greenday have \\"sold out\\" or \\"aren't really Greenday anymore.\\" That's clearly not true! Just because they made the charts with this album doesn't mean they're now manufactured pop rubbish! <br />Anyway for me the highlight of this album would have to be Wake me up When September Ends - made me cry when I saw it live. Billy Joe's rough around the edges voice blends perfectly with the soft guitar and when the drum kicks in - I'm away! Having said that the rest of the album is quality too - its really diverse and shows all the different sides of this band. Sure, its not all about smoking dope and having sex but its still Greenday and its still great!
6305079900|3.0|First you have Mr. cyborg man. This human-like machine was given many abilities from it's techologically advanced creators. One such ability is the cyborg being able to replicate the voices of anyone. Anyone except an english speaking man.  <br />   Then you have John Connor. A man from the future who, in essence, sends his best friend (Kyle Reese) back in time to have sex with his mother.  <br />   Terminator loses, Reese has sex with John Connor's mother, and now it is Terminator 2 time. <br />   We now find out that the technology for the cyborgs was first learned by humans from examining the remains of the first terminator. Okay. If this were the case, then where did the first terminator come from? So now we have a cyborg which was created \\"Ex Nihlo\\" and which suddenly appeared by some sort of divine intervention. From this point on, these movies collectively have an element of comedy factored in. I think the directors saw this critical plot flaw and, in turn, doubled the amount of guns, exposions, and loud noises in T2 to distract the loose attention span of the movie goers watching.  <br />  All in all, this movie is entertaining, I'll admit, but far more entertaining if the story line is subjected to scrutiny.
B000000OQF|5.0|Every song on this album is an absolute masterpiece.  From Welcome to the Jungle to Rocket Queen, every song shines as a rock masterpiece.  The guitar work by Slash is specially a treat.  To the other reviewers who gave this album five stars, I solute you as this album deserves nothing less.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I have loved the Beatles since 1964, when I first saw them in concert. It's one of the memories I will always cherish and this album helps me remember how wonderful it was. I was into everything the Beatles did, but the earliest stuff is my favorite, and this album gives you plenty of that. There is also some of the later stuff which I enjoy but not as much. For any Beatles fan this is a must especially those who heard \\"He Loves You\\" and \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" on the radio for the first time. ENJOY!
B00000G3AZ|4.0|I found this move fun to watch.  There are a few errors which I seem to get caught on as soon as I see them.  For one the actress that plays Jane Fairfax is crossing her legs at almost every opportunity.  Crossing your legs was considered vulgar and not at all ladylike.  She also lays back in whatever seat she is in.  She should have copied Gwyneth's example and sat errect. It was part of a young lady's training to always sit erect and ankles crossed with hands in your lap. This was an era where extreme manners and politeness were a part of your life, you could get cut in society if your manners were not the best.  It was more strict for unmarried ladies who always wanted to portray themselves in the best light always in order to maintain their social standing and catch a husband.  The Mrs. Weston, a former governess should have known better, but she also slouched throughout the movie.  I find myself also struck by the pasty look of Gwyneth's eyebrows.  They seem very painted in a way and most unnatural.  Gwyneth's performance was very good.  I cannot criticize her accent or acting, if only I could get over looking at her as Gwyneth!    My favorite characters in the whole movie are Miss Bates and Mrs. Bates.  They totally crack me up!  She is so totally believeable and you totally sympathize with her when Jane lashes out at her at the picnic.  I disagree with another's criticism of her saying she kept her voice too loud throughout the movie because if you lived with someone 24/7 who had very bad hearing, I can see where you would be used to speaking loudly. Which I don't find her doing at all. I found Jane's father a bit too robust to be a sickly gentleman.  The BBC version of Jane's father is perfect!  Once you watch that one, it's hard to see this version's father in that light.   Mrs. Elton steals the whole movie!  Her acting and character just push everyone else out of the way when she comes on scene.  Once I put all those things aside, I enjoyed watching the beautiful scenery and lovely dresses and hair that Emma wore.  Would I buy this movie again??  Yes, and since I have watched it 5 times already having only owned it a month or so, then I guess that means that I enjoy it quite a bit.   I am pretty sure you will too!

B00000JQFM|5.0|A night-and-day improvement of his debut album and probably the best instrumental rock album of its era, \\"Surfing With the Alien\\" is the Joe Satriani album that people are most likely to have, and with good reason-- the title track came as close to being a hit single as any instrumental piece has in ages and the album is just stunning. <br /> <br />Satriani, backed by a core of percussionists (Bongo Bob Smith, Jeff Campitelli and john Cuniberti) put together an album of fantastic performances-- his melodies are catchy and exciting, the arrangements are fully realized and detailed, and his playing is fierce and astonishing.  But more to the point, it avoids falling into the trap of sounding dated.  The material covers a lot of ground, from the explosive and exciting (the classic title track, the chugging \\"Crushing Day\\" and the funky \\"Satch Boogie\\") to moody and evocative (\\"Echo\\") to sentimental and lyrical (\\"Always With Me, Always With You\\", featuring perhaps the best playing Satriani has ever done.  Along the way, Satriani also throws in an overtly prog piece (the symphonic \\"Hill of the Skull\\", which ends in less than two minutes, long before it gets annoying) and a cleantone performance that will have anyone who's ever picked up a guitar staring blankly ahead (\\"Midnight\\"). <br /> <br />Invariably, this is a fine place to begin exploring Satriani's music, and certainly it may be his best album.  Highly recommended.

B000244FDW|3.0|It's amazing how many similarities there are between the spoken dialogue of this version and of the 1996 version.  But to me it was even more amazing how little feeling was communicated thru the performances and the direction. <br /> <br />Moments that I find tremendously moving and thrilling in the 1996 version pass without the least involvement in this version. <br /> <br />The direction is static and stolid. Performances are tepid compared with the spirited portrayals in the 1996 version. Casting is everything and again the 1996 cast is vivid at every level.  The director really let his 1980's cast down. <br /> <br />This is not a novel.  It's a dramatatisation of a novel, a visual retelling of a complex story in only a few hours.  You can't depend on Jane Austen to make the movie as successful as the novel. There is no way I would have wanted to read the novel if this was the only dramatisation I'd had available.
037571457X|5.0|The combination of clear graphics and succinct text create a haunting effect that has launched me on an kick of wanting to learn as much as I can about Iran and the perfectly normal people who live there, under perfectly bizarre laws.  <br /> <br />Just do yourself a favor and buy both books at once.

B000ACZLF2|5.0|Did you ever notice that if you were to show a film to after dinner friends, all too often what you bring out is a work that might not make a list of your personal top ten favorite movies?  This is one of those films.  Very postwar early 50's, but a 1950's Donna Reed would have been lost in.  It truly is the opposite of Pleasantville. <br /> <br />Hubert Selby's dark vision of the common man is woven around several characters in a Brooklyn neighborhood.  A factory worker called Big Joe is played by Burt Young.  Instinctively brutal yet pathetically naive, he wanders through his Brooklyn neighborhood functioning at the most elemental level reinforced only by an inherited value system to which he is single-mindedly loyal.  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a whore whose timeline for thoughts of her future stretches out only several hours.  She gets by in life rolling drunks whose tolerance for liquor is less than hers, or giving sex to those who outlast her.  A soldier soon to be shipped out takes her to Manhattan for his last few stateside days and falls in love with her.  Tralala (Leigh's character) recognizes the attendant lust but has no clue about the implications of his love.  As she sees him off, the Lieutenant hands her an envelope.  Tra's face lights up as her vision of the order in life (she gives him sex, he has a good time, he gives her money) seems to have been reaffirmed.  When the envelope turns out to contain a lengthy love letter she doesn't become angry or disappointed, just confused. <br /> <br />In addition to Leigh and Young, powerful performances are turned in by Jerry Orbach (the corrupt union boss), Stephen Lang (the closet homosexual strike-line foreman), Stephen Baldwin (a street punk), Ricki Lake (Big Joe's very pregnant daughter), and Alexis Arquette (the teen-age transvestite). <br /> <br />The soundtrack is excellent and unobtrusive and Uli Edel's direction insightful.  You need a strong stomach to watch it and quite a bit of dedication to findit, but it's well worth the effort. <br /> <br />Calvertbill

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I had the wonderful opportunity to see Wicked on Broadway this weekend (one of the lucky 28 lottery seat winners!), and although Idina and Kristin have been replaced by two equally talented performers in Shoshanna Bean and Megan Hilty...I'll keep this soundtrack on my list for quite some time.   <br /> <br />This certainly gives Les Miz's London recording a run for its money on my list of favorite showtune albums.
0060765445|5.0|C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.<br /><br />To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.<br /><br />Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...<br /><br />How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.<br /><br />Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.<br /><br />Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading.esy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch.

0307276902|5.0|This is a wonderful tale of addiction and recovery.  Anyone who has ever had any internal struggles can relate to some part of this book.  It's also a love story that the readers can fall in love with themselves. <br /> <br />I began reading the reviews of those who hated this book (the single star ratings)and soon came to realize one thing -- they must not have actually read the book.  There is much criticism about James Frey blaming everyone but himself.  If you read the book, you'll realize that James blames no one but himself.  He takes responsibility for all that he's done, says that he made the choices to do the things he did, and says that he will recover by making better choices.   <br /> <br />People spend far too much time criticizing others...  Why not find the beauty in this work?  And a beauty it is!

B000AYQJJ2|4.0|Fascinating. I bought the \\"Legacy\\" DVD package of all the great Karloff Frankenstein movies last night, and on a whim, rented the Dick Cavett DVD \\"Rock Icons #3,\\" which is a collection of his shows from the '70s that featured great rock artists of the day. Lo and behold on the first show was Elsa Lanchester, the Bride of Frankenstein herself. And the second show -- George Harrison! Right when he was battling with Capital Records to get Bangladesh out on album (there was no VHS or DVD, kids, but the film -- the film being reviewed here -- was in the theaters). The Cavett DVD is essential Harrison viewing and shows the whole world at a different time, when people were very much trying to figure themselves out, deal with drugs, women's lib, post-hippie life, etc. The consciousness of every single person in the three shows included on the disc appears a lot more enlightened than we all are now, that's for sure. And while cavett is a bit of constipated host, he is not too too full of himself and sometimes amusing. He doesn't treat women too kindly, so at least we've come a long way in that department. Anyway, talk shows were far far more civilized then; none of the glib crap chat that passes for conversation today. These people talked, intelligently and wittily for hours. So, there was George, and he was his usual self and funny and candid, and there was Ravi Shankar, too, playing, of course and joining the conversation, and much of it is about the concert for bangladesh. And they showed an entire clip from the film of George doing the song \\"Bangladesh,\\" and it just reminded me that this was a long time ago and concert films just weren't up to snuff. Now, mind you, it's not the deeply distressing herky-jerky MTV type of stuff. The camera stays in one place for the most part, but it is all shot very darkly and there are too many closeups and not enough shots of the band. The music, won the Grammy back then as album of the year, and it is all very, very good, from Leon toDylan to George and Clapton and badfinger and billy preston, it is all just a joy -- a community of likeminded artists extending the musical vision of all things must pass and bringing their own tangible contributions. When we see the big benefit concerts these days, they trot out one act after another to do their thing, but back in the day, they all actually teamed up and played together -- just like superheroes do in the comics, and in many ways, for a teenager back then, these were the superheroes. Clapton is God, and all that. And, of course, the Beatles. It's a wonder to revisit Bangladesh any old time and if you saw my review on the old album, I've been pleading for this remaster and rerelease for years -- and hoping for it since before George died. So, the concert is certainly worth a revisit, but don't expect a lot from the film. I almost think the album is the better way to go, but it's worth having both if you can afford it. This is Dylan at a live peak, singing the best he ever had and will in his life (Harrison didn't even know he would be performing until very late in the game) and Leon reminds us why he was so big back then -- there is absolute electricity to the duet of \\"beware of darkness.\\" George, meanwhile, is the best he will ever be live, as his wife Olivia has attested, and Clapton, so low in the hole at the time, is bracing throughout. So much has changed in the world since \\"Bangladesh\\" and now there is worry everywhere you look. It is nostalgic, to be sure, to look back on this, but the music, so sterling, remains very vital to this day.

Her performance as a grieving mother holding together her family and herself is subtle, moving and very powerful.<br /><br />However, the role would mean nothing if she was not ably supported, and this is one of those films in which every single character extracts such realism that it is hard to believe that the dialogue spoken was ever just words on a piece of paper.<br /><br />Paddy Considine is magnificent as the husband and father of a loving family that is breaking down from the inside, whilst struggling to find a role within this blackened unit.<br /><br />But, the real wonder and find of this film are the two young girls.<br /><br />Being real life sisters may have helped but, my god, they played with such resonance, such force that when watching the hospital scene I cried.<br /><br />And I rarely cry.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Audioslave (2002.) Audioslave's first album.<br /><br />In 1997, when Grunge greats Soundgarden offically disbanded, frontman Chris Cornell went on to find side projects as well as a mildly sucessful solo career. But when Rap/Rock giants Rage Against the Machine broke up in 2000, remaining 3 members of the latter band teamed up with Cornell a few years later to form the most popular Rock supergroup of the new millennium, Audioslave. With the sounds of both bands combinde, how does Audioslave measure up with these members' eariler succesful bands? Read on for my review and find out!<br /><br />In conclusion, the work these legendary '90s rockers have put out together is absolutely AMAZING. Easily one of the best bands of the new millennium so far, this album is a definate MUST have for fans of Soundgarden & RATM AND anyone who likes Classic or Modern Rock in general. Read on for my song reviews!<br /><br />1. Cochise: A blending hard rocker, \\"Cochise\\" finds Cornell wailing his ta-ta's off just as good as he did in Soundgarden. The first single to be released from this album as well, everyone will probably recognize this one from 2002.<br /><br />2. Show Me How to Live: Another big hit from this album, \\"Show Me How to Live\\" has some nice drumming from Wilk along with some more amazing high notes from Cornell himself. Any fan of Soundgarden & RATM will love this one!<br /><br />3. Gasoline: \\"Gasoline\\" is one of the heaviest rockers on the album, and it's not quite hard to see why! A slightly overrated track, yet it still rocks your socks off! Cool lyrics.<br /><br />4. What You Are: Sligtly more melodic than it's 3 preceeders, \\"What You Are\\" features smooth, subtle crooning from Cornell, yet as it builds up into the chorus, Cornell blares out at full anger & force! Morello does some nice guitar licks in this one. \\"NOW I'M FREEEEEEEE FOR WHAT YOU ARE!\\"<br /><br />5. Like a Stone: Does this one require an explination? You've all heard it, don't deny it.<br /><br />6. Set It Off: Surely enough more political than most of the songs on the album, \\"Set It Off\\" harks back to classic Rage Against the Machine with Morello's inspired Zeppelin-esque guitar riffs and Cornell's sarcastic vocals. About a man trying to light a fire at a night camp, this song will probably make you headbang and be uplifted at the same time.<br /><br />7. Shadow On the Sun: Arguably my personal favorite on the album, this one is more of a ballad than the 6 aforementioned tracks, but that makes the facts better that Audioslave can handle slower songs as well as those dandy hard rockers. Anyway, \\"Shadow On the Sun\\" has Cornell talking & singing about life and personal problems with people in general and how things made him a \\"Shadow on the Sun\\". Get it? :)<br /><br />8. I Am the Highway: Again, no major explination required. An awesome half ballad with Cornell's soaring vocals.<br /><br />9. Exploder: An \\"explosive\\" and raging rocker, Commerford provides \\"Exploder\\" with some awesome bass lines. Morello also blares out a classic distorted solo, Cornell pounds the vocals again. At the end, he blurts out some fun random gibberish! Exploder is easily one of the best on here, no questionomos asked.<br /><br />10. Hypnotize: The dancing Techno-esque beat of this catchy rocker will surely \\"Hypnotize\\" you. Mezmerizing riot-like songwriting as well, this one should've been a hit for the band, but due to slight experimintation with the song, it was one of the songs on here that faded into obscurity.<br /><br />11. Bring 'Em Back Alive: \\"Bring 'em Back Alive\\" is another guitar-driven crazy rocker with some nice faded vocals from Cornell. As well as a catchy 1-liner chorus, this one is bound to make you pissed and cool at the same time!<br /><br />12. Light My Way: A slightly funky tune at first, \\"Light My Way\\" builds up into another raging hard rocker with Cornell's classic wailing. Notice that in the second verse, there are some cell phone sound effects. So DO NOT be freakedout that it's coming from somewhere else, please! More pounding riffs from Morello!<br /><br />13. Getaway Car: A mezmerizing drum-driven ballad, \\"Getaway Car\\" is one of 'Audioslave's' (band AND album) finest moments. Probably the most beatifully written song as well, this one is an easy keeper! Cornell keeps the album going onto the last track!<br /><br />14. The Last Remaining Light: \\"The Last Remaining Light\\" was definitely the best possible album closer the band could possibly have done! Easily Cornell's most haunting vocal track, this song would be the best possible solution for the closest sounding song to his Soundgarden days.<br /><br />Whew! Lots of tracks!!! Anyway, Overall: Cornell, Morello, Wilk, & Commerford have put up an AWESOME show & set of modern-day Alternative rockers. They could've done sliiiightly better together, but in the end, I am completely satisfied with this modern-day supergroup classic release. You MUST pick it up if you love ANY type of Rock. It's so great that the group lasted for a second album!

B0000A118M|5.0|This is one of the best selling albums in the history of jazz, and with good reason. I can remember the first time that I heard this: the opening notes played by Coltrane felt like a call to arms or the beginning of a journey, and they were. I had read an article prior to hearing this piece (which I believe was written by Coltrane's son) where he said he remembered his father walking the floor upstairs and working on each passage he played to get to the true essence of what he was trying to say with the music. This care and attention shows, and that always sticks in the back of my mind whenever I listen to this album. It's truly a magical moment when you hear Coltrane's voice chanting \\"A Love Supreme\\" after he has been playing that passage of notes on his saxophone matching the syllables of the words. The musicianship here is incredible: McCoy Tyner is phenomenal on this set as is the rest of the band. Elvin Jones' polyrhythmic style of drumming as showcased on this album is extremely inspiring to me. Coltrane created a masterpiece on this album and I am always taken to a special place each time I hear it. I have given this as a gift to so many people because there is something about the spirituality and passion of this music that I think everyone should experience.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|I first have to be honest and say I hate adam sandler and usually avoid his films but I love chris rock so I watched anyway. I am glad I did as this film is a classic!<br /><br />Being that I like this film so much I rented oiginal and it suprised me how close the remake followed the orignal plotline. What was a greater surprise was that I did not like the orignal as much due to the violence towards women and its brutal nature.<br /><br />If you like simple violent john wayne type films get the original but if you like a film the teens can see with the family get the remake.

B00000IP4H|5.0|Even though this isn't my \\"favorite\\" Testament album it is definately one of the \\"HEAVIEST\\" slabs of metal (Death Metal) i have ever heard. Chuck Billy has one of the biggest badest Roars you will ever hear. Not only because he's like 6.4 and a huge MF, but also because he sings straight from the gut, NOT from the throat as with most DM vocalist's. Compared to Cannibal Corpse and Deicide he makes those boys sound like Mr.Rogers and Elmo. This album is not about \\"speed\\" although there are a few speedy moments here and there. Its just pure heavy in your face chunky as hell, balls metal. Demonic Refusal the title track stands out as the most memorable(and Gene Hoglans drumming kills),also John Doe, Burning Times, 10,000 Thrones, and Murky Waters. But as a whole this album just pounds. Buy it and prepare to hear Satan himself belching through your speakers with his mighty band from hell.

B0007ZIYWY|4.0|Released in June of 1990 as the follow-up to Daydream Nation - the album that placed Sonic Youth at the top of the late `80s independent rock scene - Goo was the band's major label debut with Geffen. Given the Deluxe Edition treatment, this pivotal work is now available in a remastered form with bonus tracks and a second disc of extras. <br />The original album - nicely freshened up by John Golden - is strung together with heavy doses of Sonic Youth's signature dissonance; however, the bizarre tunings and jagged distortion are crammed into tight song structures, making this one of their most accessible efforts. Essential tracks like \\"Dirty Boots,\\" \\"Mote\\" and \\"Kool Thing\\" (featuring Public Enemy's Chuck D) may be dated, but remain potent, assaulting rock clichs with an art-school cynicism. <br />The Deluxe Edition package includes widely bootlegged 8-track demos from Goo featuring Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis and a handful of unreleased tracks. The demos aren't wildly different than the finished product, but they do provide a more immediate and raw take on the songs. And of the previously unreleased material, only \\"Lee #2\\" - a stripped down, poetic outtake written and sung by guitarist Lee Ranaldo - is particularly noteworthy. However, the liner notes make for a good read, providing a nice snapshot of the group at that tumultuous time in pop music history. <br />Goo may not be Sonic Youth's best, but it's undoubtedly an important album in their career and proves that an experimental underground band could make the major label jump without sacrificing their credibility. For that reason alone, it's nice to see Goo get paid the respect it deserves. <br /> <br />James Barone <br />Synthesis.net

B000002KKS|2.0|Frankly they should of just changed their name, because this sounds nothing like Black Sabbath. <br /> <br />I'm not really saying this is a bad album, because it is not at all, it's just not Sabbath. And i'm not just saying that because Ozzy is gone, Dio is infact a suprior vocalist technically, but he lacks the charisma and showmanship that the Oz had with them (he doesn't anymore though) that made the band so infamous. This is more reminisent to cheesie MTV 80s metal then it is Black Sabbath, just listen to the lyrics, which sound like they were lifted from Gary Gygax. No more songs that tackle dark or serious subjects like \\"War Pigs\\" or \\"Megalomania\\", instead we get songs about dragons and kings, circles and rings, man, i used to play D&D too, but that was years ago and i'v grown up since then. Dio gets goes so over board with his medieval fantasy lyrics that the music ends up sounding more like a Dungeons & Dragons soundtrack then it does heavy metal. Dio is like the Frodo of metal. <br /> <br />Another thing that upsets me is that H&H sounds way to light and upbeat for a band like Black Sabbath, way to polished and mainstream sounding for a band like Sabbath, and just way too silly. The musicainship is exellent though, with Iommi and Butler making some of their best fret work on this one, but Bill Ward just sounds tired, non of the Jazz fuled beats he provided us on the good ol 70's albums appear on this. Dio just sounds like loon when singing for this band, plain and simple. i actaully liked him better on Rainbow to tell you the truth. I think it was that the band wanted to make it commercial with this one, they knew they would have to compete with Ozzy's solo career and that was what i think made this sound so light and fluffy sounding. This sounds more akin to Dio's solo career then it does Sabbath, this shouldn't even be called a \\"Black Sabbath\\" album. <br /> <br />I know i will be ripped apart, but i don't care, i can't call this thing Sabbth now that i think about it. At best it could be called a Iommi/Dio collaboration much like the recently released album he put out with Glenn Hughs called \\"Fused\\". <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This boxed set is the complete series of the acclaimed TV series Firefly.  Sadly, Fox screwed the series, and themselves consequently, over by running the episodes out of order and not showing the 2 hour pilot.  The Fox Network, the purveyor of the series, put the nails in Firefly's coffin because of their afore mentioned discretions, but the DVD set allows for a strong revival of the show with the show in its entirety, as well as cast and crew commentary on various episodes, a wicked, but very short, blooper reel, and the following around of the show's creator, Joss Whedon, on set.   <br /> <br />In my experience, I think the best parts of this DVD set are the blooper reel and the commentaries.  However, it's better to watch the episodes sans commentary before you watch the episodes with the commentary.  I also was very glad to see the show in its entirety and in order, as the Sci-Fi channel has been doing starting in the latter part of 2005.  This also opens the doors for the viewer to be better prepared for the concepts shown in Serenity.  The film came out in Oct. 2005.  The movie does fine as a stand alone, without seeing the show at all, but I really think that the series helps you get a better understanding of why people act the way that they do, and reveal the very deep and intense story lines that you would otherwise would not be aware of when just viewing the film by itself.  I've gotten away from \\"Firefly,\\" so I digress. <br /> <br />\\"Firefly\\" - The Complete Series is by far one of the greatest shows that appeared on television, in my opinion up there with \\"Stargate: SG1' and \\"Stargate: Atlantis\\" and \\"The X-Files.\\"  In comparison with Joss Whedon's other 2 hit series, he has again brought something new to the table that not only peaks one's interest and entertains with witty banter and action.   <br />
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I just heard this album and i must say its absolutely brilliant! Tracks like 'John the revelator' and 'Precious' take you back to the glory days of 'Violator'. Some people might complain about the quality of production and noise, but I believe its a deliberate effort to achieve the genuine Depeche Mode sound- utterly original.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|3 stars for performance rising to 4 stars over all because of excellent DVD picture & sound quality. <br /> <br />It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times.  Welcome to Cream in 2005, The DVD. <br /> <br />In the DVD interview bonus, one Peter Edward Baker (Ginger to you & me), says that the Cream reunion was all EC's idea.  Ginger says he wasn't too keen on the idea initially.  Ecca says on stage in May 2005, noble words to the effect that Cream was cut down in its prime, by events 30 odd years earlier.  Well, didn't they just decide they were sick of Cream and voluntarily broke the group up?  Jack Bruce perceptively & humorously says in interview that he was concerned that Cream in 2005 did not become a tribute band to themselves! <br /> <br />I loved Cream in their heyday.  They were so talented and influential.  I was always going to buy this DVD.  It's lovely just to see them all together again, particularly Jack & Ginger, because there has been plenty of vision of a solo Eric Clapton over the years.  It was also a shock to see Jack & Ginger in their 60's.  As for hearing them, well don't expect too much of them.  I didn't like their performance at first viewing, because it's such a contrast to their heyday, but after a number of viewings, it's grown on me and I wouldn't be without this DVD.  They did rehearse and they do play competent & solid versions of the various Cream songs, and it's all wonderfully nostalgic, but they are 3 separate guys in 2005, who used to be Cream, and a lot of water has passed under the bridge since Cream at the Fillmore in 1968.  Importantly, this DVD makes me realise just how good they all were when they were at their peak.  Clapton truly was God back then.   <br /> <br />I think Jack Bruce's bass sound on the DVD, with his \\"cello\\" shaped Gibson bass, is better than the sound he had in Cream originally and he's still a very good bass player.  His singing has its moments but, of course, his voice is not what it was.  EricClapton's singing on the DVD (from his long solo career) appears to be more professional now than Jack's, whereas that didn't use to be the case.  But Jack's singing voice, albeit diminished in 2005, and his wonderful catalogue of songs, is still principally the signature of Cream.  Eric Clapton disappointed me in that he plays a stratocaster guitar throughout these reunion shows.  OK, so Clapton's had one welded to him in his solo career;  but a stratocaster's just not Cream.  I wanted to see EC in this DVD playing a Gibson Les Paul, which he used to create that sublime guitar tone on the Fresh Cream album (and with John Mayall).  I'd even settle for seeing Eric playing an SG or a 335.  Ginger's drumming on the DVD is still very good for 66, but not awesomely spectacular like it once was.  But, he still makes the other two sound good!  I love the way Ginger seemingly forgets to \\"sing\\" the last verse of Pressed Rat & Warthog and the other two smile knowingly at each other as the band plays on without vocals. <br /> <br />The DVD is probably a good money spinner for them, but I think that's just a by-product and they were truly doing it for the right reasons to satiate public demand over the years to see these musical giants together once again.  DVD picture & sound quality are excellent.  Fans of Cream must buy this DVD, but just remember to look at the calendar before you play it. <br />
B00007M5CO|3.0|I am an avid collector and a passionate listener of downtempo and world music...tastes varying from k&D to bebel gilbeto... after discovering and immersing to fine tunes of Gotan project since a few years ago, i have been trying to discover more of the tango sound, on the way i have discovered a few beutiful south american artists among which would be Bebo and cigala, album lagrima negras, soothing piano with cross boundries of flamenco vocal, it will just have you on your knees. But Bojofondo, besides its raving reviews and sassy cover....ummm was a little dissappointing for me which only wins 3***... the artists have made an effort without a doubt and is almost...almost there but not quite...not too sure which way to suggest.....end of the day if you can spare those few bucks and are looking for something to buy and keep comming back to bojofondo go for it, else theres better...
B000002JR8|1.0|With all of the Pantera hate going on as of lately, all i can say is, Bravo! <br /> <br />It is good to finally see some people with some brains <br /> <br />In all of my years of listening to rock music of all kinds, i'v never heard anything quite as abtrocious and disatorus as Pantera. These guys were already too late by the time they came out anyway, heavy metal wasn't even popular in the 90's, so i don't see how this band can have so much of a mass folowing that a band like Megadeth or Slayer would have. This is unintelligent caveman metal, anyone who bashes heavy metal on the basis that it is for teenage delinqwits and braindead morons are probably refering to something simular to what Pantera does. I mean compare this tripe to lets say, oh, Queensryche or Iron Maiden and you will see how juvinile and pedestrian this music is, this is metals D student that non of the teachers even want to deal with in class. I'v never liked these guys at all, no matter how hard i TRIED, because all of my freinds were in to them and they tried to convert me into one of their braindead Pantera fans.... <br /> <br />they failed. <br /> <br />And as for the whole Dimebag's death thing, i mean the guy WASN'T legendary or a guitar god, but they take it too far when they insult him and make fun of his demise. The guy was a decent guitar player who sadly lost his life, just show some respect for a fallen musicain. Still, that doesn't take away the fact that they created some of the stupidest songs this side of Weird Al, i mean how can you not laugh at the over the top angry posturing that this guys did on stage? <br /> <br />I guess Pantera is good for the metal newbies, but when they mature they will want to listen to something more challengeing and engaging then this 'Angry man' rock.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B5XOYI|5.0|Unlike really super-duper powered up Superman with his 10 abilities(exaggerating but who knows), Batman has no abilities. In fact, the only ability he does have is probably resources. The money to be able to be a crime-fighter. Unlike his other DC comics compatriots, and even the Marvel fellas, Batman has to do something in order to be a super hero rather than the Flash running like hell at will. Just one of many struggles for Bruce Wayne. In film form, he's just as good as those superheroes but film adaptations can be tricky, like the last 2 entries in this set prove. For this review, instead of reviewing each DVD seperately, I'll just put all movie reviews here. <br /> <br />Batman: Directed by Tim Burton and it's one of the better entries in this set. Batman was supposed to be a more darker comic book but having very colorful comics and the cheesy 1960's show didn't help much. This film sets the tone right like Frank Miller's books. Jack Nicholson does a good Joker but anyone who's seen the animated series knows Mark Hamill(yes, the Skywalker fella) does an even better Joker. Why? Because Joker is supposed to be disturbing, like a guy who finds it funny when you fall down a stairs. Here, Nicholson is more like a prankster. Michael Keaton is a good Batman, just not Bruce Wayne. He doesn't have that troubled side that he should have. The rest are fine with, to me, a mention to Michael Gough, perfectly capturing that grandfatherly aspect of the Alfred character. Michael Caine from Begins is almost too \\"good uncle\\" like. Pacing may be off but it's a fine first entry for the Dark Knight. 8/10 <br /> <br />Batman Returns: 3 years later, same director and it's better. Here we introduce Catwoman and Penguin, played by Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito respectively. Michelle has the perfect tone of sexiness and ice-coldness, and slight warmth. And of course Danny is just as nasty and awesome. Mention also goes to Christopher Walken, playing corporate bad guy Shreck. &lt;Walken accent>He delivers his lines with gusto and strength. The story's better, more time on the villains, set pieces are better and even though financially is wasn't, this to me is #1 Batman film, battling Begins. 9/10 <br /> <br />Batman Forever: Gone is Tim Burton from the director's chair, in comes Joel Schumacher. First, the shift is extremely noticeable. While Burton matched the tone, it's almost like they tried to fuse the campiness from the 60's show with the gothicness of the previous 2 films. What we have is a film with neon face paint, bat nipples, and slight awfulness. Two-Face, which has potential of being the most complicated Rogue in the gallery, here he's actually more better Joker than Nicholson, being very upbeat and loving being bad. Jim Carrey essentially is like the prankster aspect of Joker amped up. New Batman Val Kilmer actually does the opposite of Michael Keaton: he has the perfect balance of troubled man but doesn't have the Batman tone down. This film like popcorn will fulfill its need but just not very effectively. <br /> <br />Batman and Robin: To paraphrase Treebeard from the Two Towers, there isn't a curse in dwarf, elvish or the tongue of Man that could explain the travesty that is Batman and Robin. Everything about this just screams awful. First? Well bad Mr. Freeze puns. Almost everything he says is some witty remark involving ice or cold or snow or anything cold. Then we have Bane, the character that actually broke Batman's will and spirit, not to mention his back in the comic books, ends up being \\"dumb goon\\". Then we have extreme campiness. Hated the bat nipples? Well how about on Batgirl's too? Or the Batman credit card? Or the changing of Barbara from Commissioner Gordon's daughter to Alfred's niece? I could go on and on because quite frankly, it's fun. There's so much to hate you can practically be giddy as you tear it down. This film is essential watching for aspiring filmmakers? Why? Well it's a lesson on how NOT to make afilm, especially a franchise entry. <br /> <br />Extras for each film is pretty much the same thing: a StarTV style behind the scenes, an entry into the multi-part Shadows of the Bat documentary, a feature on the making of the respective film with Beyond Batman, music videos and sometimes deleted scenes. The big highlight is the 6 part documentary Shadows of the Bat, chronicling the Caped Crusader's journey onto the big screen. It's probably on par with the Empire of Dreams documentary from the Star Wars set. <br /> <br />So there it is. 2 great films, one average film, and one film that proves sometimes making money is the only goal, not art. If you're at all into Batman or comic books or even action movies, get them. I'd warn you: the last 2 are quite bad but watch them so you'll know never to watch them again.
0385510438|5.0|Grisham is one of those writers that I will pick up without knowing what the book is about or what others think.  His writing is engaging and he is masterful at suspense.

0446577383|5.0|This is an evil and sinful book that will make your workday miserable if you happen to pick it up the evening before. Believe me, I know from experience, I started it about 9 o'clock last night and had an awfully hard time getting to work this morning.  <br /> <br />Another thing to remember is that Baldacci doesn't write formula based mysteries. You have no real assurance that the hero, Secret Service agent Alex Ford, has to live to be in his next book. He could go out in a blaze of glory but fail at his goal.  <br /> <br />The members of the Camel Club are as interesting a bunch of characters as you'll meet anywhere. And just what is the mysterious background of 'Oliver Stone,' a leading member of the 'Club?\\"  <br /> <br />The background is Washington and a bunch of career climbing bureaucrats more interested in their own future than that of the country. And just who are the bad guys working for anyway? What is it they are trying to do?  <br /> <br />Is this great fiction for all time that will be read and re-read in a hundred years -- no. But it's a damn fine read -- just don't start it at 9 o'clock in the evening.
B00005U122|4.0|Roger does a nice job on this DVD combining Floyd and his solo material. The Bravery of Being Out of Range is the best of a very inconsistant solo catalogue. This song sounds great live and the background singers do a great job. Shine On.... is a touching tribute to his former partner in Floyd. I liked this DVD and I'm hard to please on DVD ...see my RUSH in RIA review. Thanks Pegrossa for turning me on to this master.
B000002JR8|4.0|First off about the album Far Beyond Driven, this was the first Pantera album I ever owned as it was the most current when I first got into this band. Its a good album though I personally prefer Vulgar Display of Power, Cowboys From Hell, and my personal favorite (though many would disagree with me) Great Southern Trendkill. Its got a lot of songs that went on to be signatures for the band such as Im Broken, Five Minutes Alone, Becoming... etc. My personal favorite song from this album is Slaughtered, followed closely by Good Friends, and a Botte of Pills. The weakest moment (in my personal opinion) would be the cover of Sabbath's Planet Caravan (which never was one of Sabbaths stongest songs anyhow). So overall id say if its your first Pantera record go for Vulgar Display as its probably the best entry to the band, if you already have those records by all means get this one. Now as a response to the Pantera hating, I get a feeling your probably around 15 years old Pantera Hater by just reading the crap you wrote (and the fact you cant spell). Please take your juvenile crap to some kiddie message boards on [...] or something. Yea Pantera wasnt for everyone I accept that but for a lot of us this band defined the metal movement for us when we were growing up. No one getting shot to death on stage is deserved no matter how you dislike the band and their music.
0783114222|5.0|I was overwhelmed by the quality of this work. I remember the actual events, and this series captures the excitement of the era while capturing the depth and breadth of the challenge.  <br />My 15 year old daughter and sons ages 12, 9, and 7 were all taken up with this work. The cast, the acting, the writing, the research, etc were all first rate.  <br />Buy it, rent it, borrow it, BUT PLEASE WATCH IT. <br /> <br />Patrick J. McGervey
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never thought that, after years of being a film critic, I would ever care that much for the characters of a short lived SciFi TV series. But here I am, in love with every member of the crew, the ship itself and certainly the daring & intelligent creators of \\"Firefly\\".    Which leaves me to channel all my hate and rage towards the program directors at Fox: Had they just cancelled the show in a display of shocking professional stupidity, they would deserve to be fired. But since they - for whatever reason - used every trick in the book to stop Firefly from becoming a commercial success, they actually deserve to be thrown into space without a suit (they can keep their ties).    I wish I had the money to resurrect the show.
B00005V1B1|4.0|The 70s produced a number of great prog bands. Many of them are gone now but one is still plugging away. Camel was hardly noticed in the 70s, 80's , 90's and 2000's. It is a real shame because they have several great progressive works. And Camel is still progging today thanks to the wonderful talents of Latimer.
B0000640SA|1.0|This movie is typical of modern \\"cinema\\": it is sordid and vulgar and filled with morally vile people.  This is the disedification that passes for art nowadays.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|\\"The Human Stain\\" is an intense drama directed by Robert Benton who won both the Best Director and the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscars for \\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\" in 1979.  He's also has 2 nominations for Best Original Screenplay Oscars for \\"Bonnie & Clyde\\" (1967) & \\"The Late Show\\" (1977) and a Best Director nomination for \\"Places in the Heart\\" (1984).  His direction here might have gained more attention if the film had worked a bit better.  Nicholas Meyer wrote the screenplay as he did for 1987's \\"Fatal Attraction\\" and his Oscar nominated Best Adapted Screenplay for \\"The Seven Percent Solution\\" (1976).  This is the third Philip Roth novel I'm aware of to be adapted to film following \\"Goodbye Columbus\\" (1969) & \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\" (1972).<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins who has an Oscar for \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" (1991) + 3 other nominations for \\"The Remains of the Day,\\" \\"Nixon\\" and \\"Amistad\\" plays the aging professor Coleman Silk with a bravado and intensity.  Phyillis Newman has a rare film cameo as his wife Iris Silk and has a wonderful heart attack scene where her arm flops uselessly.  I kept wondering why Hopkins wasn't calling 911, but that might have cut the drama.  Hopkins dances marvelously with Gary Sinise on the porch.  Sinise who has a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for \\"Forest Gump\\" and is currently riding high on TV in \\"CSI New York\\" plays Ginger Rogers to Hopkins' Fred Astaire and does some lovely pirouettes on the porch.  It's an odd scene, but it's interesting.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman who won the Oscar in \\"The Hours\\" and played in that film with Ed Harris who was also nominated for an Oscar plays Faunia Farley.  She does a great character performance of a sleazy trailer park trash janitor whose hard luck story of dead children broke her heart and her spirit.  Now she is pursued by crazy ex-con Lester Foley who ultimately drives her to the drink.  (Pun intended.)  Harris is explosive and displays more spirit in his brief role here than in most of the \\"Empire Falls\\" mini-series.<br /><br />The interesting part of the story has to do with the young Coleman Silk played by Wentworth Miller who is currently in the TV series \\"Prison Break\\" and also played in \\"Underworld.\\"  Miller has a brooding self-centered intensity that serves the film well.  However, neither he nor Hopkins looks particularly black; so it becomes rather hard to believe.  Anna Deavere Smith from \\"Philadelphia\\" (1993) and a horror flick with Jon Bon Jovi this year called \\"Cry Wolf\\" has several excellent scenes as his mother who realizes that her race makes her not good enough for her ambitious son.  Jeff Perry from TV's \\"Nash Bridges\\" (who I knew long ago from Illinois State) does a nice cameo as a tennis player.<br /><br />The cinematography and the performances glue us to the screen.  But in the end, the film doesn't quite hang together.  It's a good try.  It offers a good evening's entertainment, given somewhat lower than Oscar expectations.  Enjoy!f the \\"Empire Falls\\" mini-series.   <br /> <br />The interesting part of the story has to do with the young Coleman Silk played by Wentworth Miller who is currently in the TV series \\"Prison Break\\" and also played in \\"Underworld.\\"  Miller has a brooding self-centered intensity that serves the film well.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|I LOVE my CD!  Each song is beautiful.  Their voices are so pure and clear.  I esp. love to listen to them as I am driving on long trips.  It makes me get into a good mood!
B0002IVN9W|1.0|Browsing through the alternative rock pages of amazon, I came upon this record.  <br />As it was highly-rated (4 stars and a half on average), I listened to all the samples. I simply did'nt liked any. (I'm not judging the words, just the music).  <br />So, I'm telling you just that.  <br />Just a question of taste in the end, so don't be influenced by me and give it a try, but on the samples before buying it!!!
B00009V7T2|5.0|Thanks to Amazon.com's handy Recommendations, I discovered this absolutely brilliant band.  Tired of stale crap on the \\"alternative\\" and \\"modern rock\\" radio stations?  You will not be disappointed by \\"De-loused\\".  The Mars Volta blend sci-fi/fantasy lyrics with layers of guitar work and sounds.  The album is supposedly a concept album about a man called \\"Cerpin Taxt\\" who delves into a drug-induced fantasy world only to wake up and jump to his death off of a building.  Most of this is hard to pick up as the lyrics are very obtuse.  This not necessarily a bad thing as it adds more depth to the album.  In addition, the songs are not simple verse-chorus-verse in structure.  They simply defy categorization.  All of this makes a stimulating experience.  I have been listening to the album non-stop for 3 weeks now and discover new things every time I listen.  A new lyric is picked up here, and new riff is picked up there. <br /> <br />Simply put, buy this album.  Buy a pair of large headphones, lay back and listen to the whole thing through.  You will not regret it.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|\\"Closer\\" is a heavyweight breathtaking drama that rivets the viewer's attention.  The characters are not entirely likable, although each is eminently watchable.  Director Mike Nichols won the Oscar for Best Director for \\"The Graduate\\" in 1967 and has been nominated 3 other times for \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" (1966), \\"Silkwood\\" (1983), & \\"Working Girl\\" (1988).  Along with films like \\"Primary Colors\\" and the TV mini-series \\"Angels in America,\\" he has an unparalleled ear for dialogue.  No, it's not particularly pleasant.  No, these are not the people your pastor hopes you will be.  But each of these characters represent needs and desires that are shared by most people and are as confused by them as are many.  Patrick Marber's screenplay adaptation of his stage drama is heart-wrenchingly truthful.<br /><br />Of the four strong performances here, the most revelatory for me was Julia Roberts' portrayal of American photographer Anna living in London.  She is selfish but has a conscience.  She takes what she wants, but tries not to admit to it.  In the scene with Larry where she breaks up her marriage, it is some of the best screen time of her career.  When Larry grills her on the details of her sexual relationship with Dan, her zinger about the taste of his semen, \\"It's like yours only sweeter\\" is like a bullet shot from a gun.  It recalls the Elizabeth Taylor line in \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,\\" \\"You can take it; you married me for it.\\"  It is utterly fearless and brilliant.  What a raw amazing performance!<br /><br />As Dan, Jude Law turns is an edgy self-effacing performance that adds to his reputation as one of the great young actors.  His scenes with Natalie Portman are enhanced by their similar pairing in \\"Cold Mountain.\\"  On camera, Law is magnetic.  As Dan, the writer of the newspaper obituary column, he turns the ordinary into the extraordinary.<br /><br />Clive Owen is amazing as the strong less-than-sensitive type.  His internet sex dialogues with Jude Law's Dan posing as Anna on the computer are as intense as they are manipulated.  When he sits in the aquarium with Anna and with tremendous embarrassment learns the truth, he admits, \\"He certainly can write!\\"  In the scene with Julia Roberts he bellows \\"I'm a caveman.\\"  It seems to typify the heart of \\"Closer,\\" investigating these very primal sexual urges we have and how they interweave with the emotional attachments we call \\"love.\\"  Owen was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role and won the Golden Globe Award.<br /><br />As Alice, Natalie Portman turns in an amazing performance.  Her character seems somewhat beyond reach, but she works the territory masterfully, exploring each need and nuance as if it were a beautiful discovery.  Portman was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar and also won the Golden Globe Award.<br /><br />Damien Rice's song \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" is an interesting DVD extra with that riveting chorus, \\"Can't take my eyes off of you.\\"  It's the perfect love song for this film, part pure love and part compulsive addiction.  Mike Nichols has worked with an excellent cast and polished this dialogue to perfection.  The rhythms build and twist and the lovers attract, repel, trust and betray.  It does not so much build to an inevitable conclusion so much as it feels like we've followed the characters through a very intense period of life.  This is a film that will be watched and discussed for decades.  Bravo!ues with Jude Law's Dan posing as Anna on the computer are as intense as they are manipulated.  When he sits in the aquarium with Anna and with tremendous embarrassment learns the truth, he admits, \\"He certainly can write!\\"  In the scene with Julia Roberts he bellows \\"I'm a caveman.\\"  It seems to typify the heart of \\"Closer,\\" investigating these very primal sexual urges we have and how they interweave with the emotional attachments we call \\"love.\\"  Owen was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role and won the Golden Globe Award. <br />  <br />As Alice, Natalie Portman turns in an amazing performance.

1851774408|5.0|I just got 19th Century Fashion in Detail by Lucy Johnston from Amazon.com and it is worth every penny. For those of us on the U.S. side of the pond, it is a companion volume to Fashion in Detail(17th and 18th centuries)and the photographed fashions(from the V&A collections)are every bit as drool worthy. The format is the same as the previous book and the World Fashion in Detail(I don't own both have seen this one): The left-hand page has a complete description and line drawing of an entire garmet or garmets. The right hand side of the page has a stunning full-color view of a detail and sometimes the entire garment or garments. The book covers men's and women's fashions, including shoes. It is divided into the usual sections like the other books that are a little offbeat as it is subjects, not strictly chronological.  On the cover is a stunning magenta bustle dress of the mid 1870's that lovers of the bustle era will itch to copy. The dress is actually three pieces with two separate bodices which was pretty common among surviving dresses of the last half of the 19th c, and has both a back view of one bodice and a side view of the entire ensemble. One bodice is for day and the other a dinner(not short sleeved formal ball)bodice. <br /> <br />Get this as a Christmas gift for self or a friend who loves beautiful surviving fashions. <br />
B000005J48|5.0|I was introduced to the music of Astor Piazzolla by the more than great violinist Gidon Kremer when he played a virtuosic tango as an encore.  Whenever a rich new vein of wonderful music is opened to me, well, it makes for a bright and happy day.  Not long after I picked up this CD and I can recommend it to you highly.  This is more than just tango dance music, these are serious and contemplative compositions that use the Tango as the vehicle just as the classical and especially Baroque composers used their dance music for instrumental compositions.  The music is full of mood, sensuality, rhythm, lush harmonies, dissonance, love, and pain.  It is a music of contrasts and never gets too fussy or complicated.  It wears its heart on its sleeve and draws us in because it is so charming.<br /><br />Each piece has its own varied ensemble and the musicians in that ensemble also arrange the music for that track.  Kremer leads from the violin in all of them, after all it is his album and his hommage to Piazzolla.  However, the instruments used depend on the musical materials and mood of the piece.  The piano is used quite a bit, and at times there are wind instruments.  The bandone&oacute;n is required in tango, as well.  It is a kind of concertina that was developed and made in Germany, but adopted in Argentina for the Tango.  It has a wonderfully reedy sound and is played with buttons on each side of the bellows.  Depending on the model, the note can change or stay the same whether you are pulling the bellows out or pushing them in, but in all of them there are two voices always at the octave and gives the bandone&oacute;n its characteristic sound.<br /><br />The only composition not by Piazzolla is a very interesting tango included as a tribute to the master entitled \\"El sol sue&ntilde;o\\" by Jerzy Peterbushsky.<br /><br />This is good music and a very enjoyable change of pace.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|A mix of Violator, Ultra and Broken Frame.     I always thought that Depeche Mode's music lacked it's trademark atmosphere after the departure of Alan Wilder; and after being thoroughly dissapointed with Exciter, I almost thought it would be better if the mode just retired. 'Playing the Angel', however, is a return to form and shows that they getting closer to rediscovering their classic sound after all these years.    - A Pain that I'm used to (5 out of 10)  A wonderful scratchy siren noise opens up the album and a slow techno beat slowly fades in. The verses are really good but I found the chorus to be rather dissapointing and out of place.    - John the Revalator (7 out of 10)  I was dreading this song, as I had heard a little clip on the internet and it didn't bode well. What a surprise it was to find that it is actually rather good. It builds up into a  wonderful anthemic song and by the end, my foot had almost tapped a hole through the floor.    - Suffer Well (10 out of 10)  A great track. This is classic Depeche Mode doing what they do best. And there I was thinking that all Dave Gahn's songs were going to be a bit rubbish.     - The Sinner in me (5 out of 10)  A nice enough song, although possibly one of the weakest ones on the album in my view. The melody reminds me of \\"breathing in fumes\\" from Black Celebration.    - Precious (9 out of 10)  You've probably heard this track already. I though it was the best single they've released for a long time. Wonderful sound,  great chorus and nice lyrics.    - Macro (5 out of 10)  Martin sings. Not his best effort it has to be said. But certainly not as bad as the two songs he sang on Exciter.    - I want it all (9 out of 10)  What a corny title! But what a fantastic song. A slow song with a really sad echoing chorus. A slightly new sound for Depeche Mode.     - Nothing's Impossible (10 out of 10)  Another corny title...another fantastic song. The best song on the album in my view. Once again this is classic mode at their best. Dave Gahan has really done himself proud with this.    - Introspectre  Moody instrumental. The sounds remind me of Broken Frame.     - Damaged People (9 out of 10)  The best \\"Martin vocal\\" song for years. I love the whole sound of this song and the lyrics are really nice.    - Lilian (8 out of 10)  The music is classic Depeche mode, but the vocals are slightly odd and lazy. A good song nevertheless.    - The Darkest Star (7 out of 10)  A slow atmospheric song. A slightly ambient song in many respects. Nice to listen to in the dark.     This is the first Depeche Mode release in ages that I can honestly say that I would have bought, even if I didn't know that it was by Depeche Mode! If they could bring themselves to make a fully electronic album with no guitars, they could very well produce something to rival the brilliance of violator.
B000AARKOO|4.0|While accurate history may suffer under the hand of Director Scott, the psychology of leadership and the heart of man do not.  I wasn't expecting a documentary of 12th century Palestine.  I just didn't want some sort of caricatured Christianity or Islam where all things are black and white.  I know enough of the history of the Crusades to know that the issues were more complex than that.  And I believe Scott gave us a delightfully gray world.<br /><br />Balian's motives are simple enough:  He seeks forgiveness.  The channels are open, but he doesn't hear anything from God.  So he just does the best he can.  This film has it all.  Good Muslims, bad Muslims, Good Christians, Bad Christians.  I particularly enjoyed Ed Norton as the leper king Baldwin and the steely eyed Ghassan Massoud as the wise Saladin.  Throw in a bunch of those zany Templars (more difficult to control than a bunch of hyper-caffeinated preteen girls at a slumber party!) and you're ready to rock and roll.<br /><br />Through it all - and there's some pretty good action here - we don't lose track of Balian and the redemption story.  The film does a pretty good job of ending where it begins, lessons having been learned at least by one man.  I saw it in the theater and I was one of about a half dozen people there.  I hope the DVD does better because it deserves to.  I'd give it four and a half stars if I could.

B00005ATQD|2.0|'Eyes Wide Shut' was the final film of the legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's films probably have had greater disagreement among film lovers than any other movie maker in history. Just for that he deserves to be remembered. Those who love his works call him a genius, while those that hate his films call him a charlatan. Regardless of what people may think of him and his movies, it is no doubt that his films continue to fascinate the movie fanatics. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is no exception, although this reviewer will sympathize with those do no like this film.<br /><br />Most of this movie is very difficult to watch. No doubt, Kubrick's impeccable craft is still there. The lighting, editing, music and a creepy atmosphere stays throughout the film, as it does in many of his other films. What is horribly lacking in the movie is a screenplay, story, and most importantly, a point or moral. The screenplay is downright awful. I swear Tom Cruise repeats everything another character says to him. It is as though Cruise's character is absolutely clueless and has ADD. It is as though the screenwriters could not find anything better to write. The story is a absolute mess. Each scene is drawn out three times longer than it should. There are long pauses in the conversations, even though the characters are talking about the most mundane things. Rumors exits that Kubrick was a control freak. These rumors might be right. He was so obsessed with photography and technique that he destroyed any kind of spontaneity. The plot of 'Eyes Wide Shut'? Tom Cruise walks around \\"New York City\\" all night long encountering one bizarre sexual encounter after another. Many of these scenes are embarrassing and painful to watch. None of these encounters seem to bring any kind of point, except things most people already know.<br /><br />Although this movie has many bad things going for it, other things stood out that saved the film from being one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, and Sydney Pollack do a fantastic job in their acting. Their performances are powerful and convincing, and salvage a badly written story. Stanley Kubrick once again shines in his directing, as the orgy scene and the \\"billiard room talk\\" are both hair-raising and brilliant film-making. In the end though, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is pretty much a waste of time. Kubrick died before he finished editing the film, so maybe what we saw wasn't what he really intended. Nonetheless, even if Kubrick had completed the movie before his death, I don't see how the final product could have been any better.Sydney Pollack do a fantastic job in their acting.

B00005NI5Y|1.0|We are used to Dylan pleasing us, and disappointing us. Vearing off into rock, which proved OK, then religion, some good songs, and his disappointments of, mostly, the eighties. Now this. To me a total flop, a complete sellout. Nothing original here. Only echos of his good old self and, this hurts, pop. If it wasn't Dylan, you'd puke. Because it's Dylan, there is only pain. <br /> <br />pepe nero
B000001EAQ|5.0|This is the album where U2 really let loose.  Gone are the uplifting sonic vistas and anthemic choruses.  Gone are the aesthetically measured guitar jangles and pleasing radio-friendly synthesizer loops.  U2 tap into their collective Id, open a vein, and watch what comes out. <br /> <br />The result is a staggering piece of music: Pop is raw, pounding, intense, heavy, and unrelenting.  It is U2's \\"dirty\\" album.  Songs aren't as overtly about political awareness as on previous albums (e.g. songs like \\"Pride\\" or \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\"), but more about personal conflict and self-doubt. Their previous two albums (Achtung Baby and Zooropa) dealt with similar themes, but mostly with detachment and irony, as if they were considering what it could be like to lose control, from an \\"artistic\\" perspective.  On Pop, they take this one step further, and lose that detachment.  Pop is sung from the depths of the soul, without trying to idealise what it means to be a human being in this day and age. <br /> <br />The themes are therefore often difficult, but intensely human, ranging from fear of complete burn-out (\\"Last Night on Earth\\") to loss of faith (\\"Wake Up Dead Man\\"), to general longing for a better world (\\"If God Will Send His Angels\\").  The lyrics are sometimes disturbing but ring true: \\"afraid of what you'd find if you took a look inside [...] I'm happy to go blind\\" - U2 have traditionally sung a lot about what's ugly, wrong, or beautiful in the world; this time, they sing about what's ugly, wrong, or beautiful inside their minds.  In that sense, I've always felt this is an album that connects much more strongly with listeners than their other work.  And sometimes too strongly! <br /> <br />\\"Discotheque\\", \\"Staring at the Sun\\", \\"Miami\\", and \\"Velvet Dress\\" also deal with the different facets of addiction and denial, ranging from drug-fuelled fun (\\"Discotheque\\") to near burn-out loss of reality (\\"Miami\\").  \\"MoFo\\" and \\"Do You Feel Loved?\\" deal with being lost in the world, \\"Playboy Mansion\\" deals with that feeling we've all had that the world just doesn't really make sense. <br /> <br />The resulting sounds are diverse and entrancing, ranging from a 90s techno beat (e.g. the Prodigy-like \\"MoFo\\", or the trance-like \\"Discotheque\\") to what is probably the most sensual song U2 has ever recorded (\\"Velvet Dress\\"), with a dab of spaghetti Western thrown in the mix (\\"Wake Up Dead Man\\").  U2 tap the musical zeitgeist of the 90s better than ever on this record.  In a sense, U2 have surrendered themselves completely to their music on Pop. <br /> <br />Because U2 have surrendered themselves so entirely, the sounds are not homogenous, they can be chaotic and brutal, but the essence of U2 comes through like a locomotive in the recording.  The songs are beautiful in a raw, desperate, and often fun-out-of-control way.  Definitely worth investing into, but not the easiest listen in the world. <br /> <br />In other words, if you're a big fan of U2's pre-1991 and post-2000 work (i.e. the radio-friendly singles), this is probably not the best album for you (although in my humble opinion it is a valuable educational experience at the very least!).  However, if you felt that Achtung Baby and Zooropa were genius and needed to be pushed a bit further, then by all means get this, you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />For many people, this is a \\"love it or hate it\\" record, but it doesn't leave people cold.  I'm definitely on the \\"love it\\" side, but I admit it took me a little while to get there!! <br /> <br />
B0001932ZA|5.0|First off, I think it's funny one of the other reviewers mentioned the host being a forerunner for wrestler Vince McMahon.  Isn't the host Family Feud's lovable Englishman Richard Dawson?<br /><br />In any case, I haven't seen this movie in years but I remember loving every bit of it.  From the cheesy one-liners that we've come to expect from Schwarzenegger in all of his movies to the slight possibility that we may use the death penalty for entertainment purposes in the future, it's very easy to look past the bad scripting and almost-as-bad casting and just have fun with the movie.  The movie probably won't scare you or thrill you like the Stephen King book it was adapted from, but it will certainly entertain you.  For that reason, I'm looking past any of its drawbacks and giving it five stars.

B00000I41G|4.0|This is the first Kenny Burrell CD in my collection, but it won't be the last. This is a great collection of blues tunes, both original and standards. A variety of tempos and keys keeps things interesting, and I was almost surprised when the last tune finished.<br /><br />After listening to the first few tracks, I had to stop the CD, plug in my guitar, and start it over, so I could play along. Great grooves, and lots of great jazz-blues licks. I am almost embarrassed that I have been ignorant of Kenny's music for all these years. The upside is all the great new music I have to look forward to! This CD also very interesting for SRV fans, where you will hear some familiar licks, since Stevie learned a lot from Kenny.
B00005JNQA|1.0|Thoroughly incompetent yarn about an U.N. interpreter and an assassination attempt of one of Africa's corrupt leaders.  The direction is boring and predictable: most of if is composed of shots of Kidman and counter-shots of Sean Penn, with some intrusions from secondary characters and set-pieces which don't help to sustain our already ripped net of suspense of disbelief.  Politically inept (cinematically and dramatically it doesn't fare better), the film tries to convince us that those who fight against corruption become corrupted once in government without any external help doing so.  It seems here that African people is naturally ineffectual in establishing a secure government for themselves.  Does the West have something to do with that?  Can an armed revolution establish a better government (than before) for the people?  I have some examples at hand, and those contradict whatever false pacifism Pollack is trying to get home.  When romantic music arises in one of infinite personal encounters between the interpreter and the secret agent that \\"investigates\\" her (did I mentioned that the agent recently \\"lost\\" his wife?), the worst of Hollywood takes command and remembers you that some people in some place think that you're so stupid that you will pay for their inflated wages and stock-options from the entertainment industry.  Don't let them do it, and send instead a paycheck for the price of this DVD to some organization helping African people get a future.  You'll feel better (and by the way, stop buying diamonds: people get killed discovering those for you).
B000003TA4|5.0|I was anxious about this album when I bought it, I hoped it would be good but I had doubts, man was I blown away! Nevermind is a monumental album, it set standards and created a huge following for the grunge rock genre. Kurt Cobain was a genius, there is no doubt but let us not forget about Dave Grohl and Chris Novaselic, equally good musicians. Nirvana really was the greatest rock band ever and Nevermind reminds us of how in a few short years they shaped rock music and accomplished so much.<br /><br />Every song on this album is terrific, it contains many classics and shows off Nirvana's talents. The first track has to be the most well known song by this band. Smells Like Teen Spirit is pure genius. The lyrics are perfect and so are the vocals. The chorus is just superb. I love this song so much, it's great. In Bloom is another 'standard' from this album and like the song before it, it has a great chorus. Again also a classic. Come As You Are is a more laid-back track and not as energetic as Teen Spirit and In Bloom. I really like Kurt's vocals on this track.<br /><br />Breed is classic Nirvana, killer rifs and superb writing, it's a really energetic and fast paced song. The chorus is again great.<br /><br />It may start off a bit slow but soon Lithium gets paced and really packs a punch. The guitar is great on this track.<br /><br />Polly shows Nirvana's softer and acoustic side. The song is really haunting. The next song may be short but is a standout on this album and contains Grohl's superb incredibly fast drums and Kurts screams. The song overall is great.<br /><br />Drain You is a classic rock song where surprisingly the verse is better than the chorus. It starts off with Novaselic's trademark bass line and moves in all directions but overall a great song, that's Lounge Act. Stay Away is Nirvana and probably the catchiest song on the album and has great echo/response sections to it. On A Plain is quite experimental in which Kurt sings \\"I love myself better than you\\". This paves the way for a spectacular ballad, Something In The Way. It contains a superb cello and Kurt's voice is full of longing and emotion.<br /><br />Anyway you look at this album you realise what an impact it had on society. Nirvana were tragic talents, Kurts death was a shock to the industry and will remain a huge loss forever. They may have been around for less than a decade but they are now appearing on all sorts of 'best of all-time' lists.<br /><br />Amazing.ou\\".

1932907009|1.0|This author talks a big game, that he is a successful screenwriter and that this book offers advice from one who is successful as opposed to someone who theoretically understands screenwriting but hasn't sold anything.  Well, this book just sucks!  This author may have sold stuff, but based on what he has had produced, and the constant pitches he makes (an example: The presidents helicopter crashes behind enemy lines and the president has to capture Osama Bin Laden, called &#34;Chickenhawk Down&#34; and is pitched as &#34;Galaxy Quest&#34; with George Bush - and he can't understand why this didn't sell - By the way, how is that concept remotely like Galaxy Quest, which was a funny comic parody of Star Trek) .  This man is a hack!  When you put down a film like Memento and praise &#34;Legally Blonde&#34; as one of the greatest titles for a film in years, it is astonishing!  I should have guessed it was going to be bad based on his two produced films, &#34;Blank Check&#34; and &#34;Stop, or my Mom will shoot&#34; (which was one of the two films that has almost destroyed Sylvester Stallone's career) then there really isn't anything more to say.  You may be making money pal, but your films are disposable trash.  I would have given this no stars if Amazon would have let me.
0679422714|1.0|I have never felt moved to write a review before but I want to stop this travesty of a book from getting into the hands of serious students of history (not least because of the expense of this piece of pulp fiction). All you need to do to get the jest of this book is to read the first paragraph. Take a look at the over inflated numbers, put it down and move on to something more believable (try the sci-fi section). <br />To say that it is blatantly bias is an under statement. It is, from cover to cover, nothing more than a hack job against Mao. Mao was no saint. But he was not the devil. They portray the China of the early 20th century as a Utopia. They pretend warlords are no more threatening than vandals, and that the European influence in China was the most positive thing to happen in its history. <br />Mao was a pig. He left multiple wives and laughed about it later. OK, do we need to hear about it on page after page in a book that claims to be a political biography? No. <br />Mao killed a lot of people. Wow. That is some ground breaking research, it took them 10 years to find that? You would think they could have a least come up with a believable number. 70 million in peacetime to paraphrase.(Peacetime is there qualifier to make sure Hitler and Stalin can not catch up). This is not to minimize those who did die, but lets face it that number is far too large.  <br />I could go on and on, but I will not, mostly because to do so would make it seem like they actually have an argument that is sort of historical. They do not. They do not even have a LOGICAL argument. You can read the first pages of this book, knowing nothing about Mao, and realize that they are not presenting the facts in an intellectually honest way. <br />If you are not interested in history though, and just want a nice piece of...whatever this book is...it is readable. The prose are laid out relatively well and you can fly through it, as it is not that complexed.
B000002B35|3.0|Now this is considered the live masterpiece of the so-called post-Waters era. While it certainly gives an excellent (acoustic) idea of what happened during Floyd concerts in the mid-1990s, it is by no means a masterpiece. Until the early 1980s Pink Floyd used to be highly influential only in terms of its studio ventures anyway, not as far as their live performances are concerned. Too big has the discrepancy between the quality of the studio recordings and their live renditions always been. If you want to listen to live recordings on which such a discrepancy is almost non-existent, you had better check out some King Crimson live albums. A nice introduction to the Floyd catalogue for new would-be fans, but no substitute for the 'real, i.e. studio, thing'.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|I saw this movie 5 months ago and still cannot get it out of my mind.  Calling it intense is and understatement. Not for the faint of heart, if you can stomach it, it is one of the best movies you will ever see.  Having known an addict for over 10 years and seeing first hand what it can do to your life; this movie accurately reflects just how bad things can get.  The acting is outstanding as is this cinematography.  It will change the way you think about life.

Buy this album, it's an absolute masterpiece, one of the few cds you can pop in and listen all the way through. <br /> <br />From the slow dirge of The Package and sonic onslaught of The Outsider to the etherial calm of the Nurse, you always are treated to something unexpected and refreshing. <br /> <br />Five stars!!!!

B000002HRE|1.0|I know what you're going to say:  \\"Metallica has matured, every album can't be Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning\\".  Well, you're right, they have matured. . .to a ripe old age where they've lost their hearing.  I would like someone to seriously convince me that this is a good album beyond the tired, afore-mentioned responses.  The riffs are repetitive, the lyrics are redundant, and the arrangements go no where.  I can't even comment on the individual songs on this train wreck so I'm out.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I've heard people say that this album is depressing, which may be true.  However, it is also beautiful.  Beck is extremely talented, and it's nice to see and array of styles from him, from folk to crazy ass awesome rock out to chill.  When Beck makes an album, he makes an album that flows, much like a Pink Floyd album.  Also much like Pink Floyd this is a great cd to pop into the car whilst driving late at night.  Beck does every style he does wonderfully, and his chillout style is awesome.  I listen to this all the time while reading or when about to go to bed.
B000002U82|5.0|This album's extraordinary run on the charts really says all you need to know about its intergenerational appeal, but I have to add that the song \\"Time\\" was a catalyst for my spending less and less of that resource in a haze and more of it scribbling past the first half page of my life.  But that kind of irony fits perfectly with the mood of Dark Side.  It's an album that pulls at the full range of emotions, takes you into a synesthetic universe of aural visuals and leaves you with snatches of lyrics that hang in your mind decades after you first heard them.  [...]
6305736650|2.0|Yes.  I know Casablanca is a classic, but I didn't think that it was very good.  The acting was subpar and the storyline dull.  A lot of the lines were so ludicrous that I found myself cracking up, much to the displeasure of my friends.  I personally think that it is overrated, and had it been made today it would be shot down as a stupid romance that only girls go to see and then weep over.  I don't think that it would recieve all the critical acclaim that it does.  Of course, the reason it recieved such critical acclaim could be because it was one of the first of it's kind and whatnot.  I, however, found myself not giving a damn if she stayed with him or left.  So there you have it.  The movie did not move me at all.  Pun uninentional.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had watched a few of the firefly shows when they were on tv earlier. Watching the dvds was very cool and this series gets you ready for the movie Serenity. There is a little bit of everything is this scifi series. The characters are all believable and you really get a good feel for the way they are. Needless to say there is soome sexual tension between the characters which always makes the series more interesting. The special effects are very good. <br />
B00004TH7Z|3.0|it's so good to have Bruce back in Maiden after the dismal Blaze Bailey era that produced a few flat and boring albums of uninspired music. also back in the fold is the excellent guitarwork of Adrian Smith; bringing the axe count to three! unfortunately, it's tough to feel the presence and power that one would expect from a metal arsenal like that. i'm not sure if that's because of the album's production or simply the fact that these songs may have been written with only basic guitar parts in mind, but it would have been nice to hear more of a three-pronged guitar attack in these songs...which would have added a spectacular melodically technical edge. although these songs are all solid tunes, the album, as a whole, seems to lack a real power and punch that was so golden on Maiden's past records (and on Bruce Dickinson's later solo releases). so, while Brave New World is a welcome addition to this band's musical legacy, it's kind of a letdown when one considers how great and how brave and new it could have been.
B000001FGG|5.0|and finally bought the album Wheels of Fire. Now, Cream were a blues band (not a rock band) inspired by classical pieces of music and Pete Brown-style poetry, yet everything they did ROCKED and they never quite made it as songwriters. Check out the Inside Cream DVD release if you haven't already. Anyway, this is still a great record, despite the confusion about it. The live album is the best. \\"Crossroads\\" is the best blues jam I have ever heard anywhere by anybody ever. The bass and guitar are so fast and raucous that you are inclined to believe they will fly to pieces, but of coarse, they never do. This song demonstrates the intensity and excitement that people got out of seeing great rock/blues being performed live, and showed why it was necessary. I can't imagine \\"Crossroads\\" in the studio. \\"Spoonful\\" is brilliant too, however, so turn it up load. Those seventeen minutes fly by. Who the heck says it is boring? Music is awesome and exciting, and these guys could play. The Band are actually my cup of tea, and I don't think Clapton quite held a candle to Hendrix, but if you want a record by Cream to give any one of those two competition, this would be the one. \\"White Room\\" is a classic, but the rest of the studio side is imaginative and fresh. So pick this up even if you don't like long blues improvisation. Cream just may turn you on to what Dylan and Robbie were rebelling against, without ever endangering your desire to go back to their ingenious music. Oh, and Clapton and Baker are two of the best musicians I have ever heard.
B000063DHL|5.0|with the career-defining Powerslave album under their belt, Iron Maiden returned with this excellent follow up slab full of powerful, tight, and intelligent metal. in a time where most heavy metal and hard rock bands were singing about the worldly pleasures of drug and drink, Maiden seemed to be the only popular group that wanted to rock out with serious liturature themes and imaginative sci-fi concepts. Somewhere In Time is not quite the tour de force that was Powerslave; but it stands as another strong collection of great songs and a timeless metal masterpiece.
B000667GFK|5.0|Luis Miguel is a great artist. His voice is one of the best if not the best one out there.  This cd is great, the melodys the music and the lyrics are just great. Every song is a work of art.  I recomend this cd to anyone!  It is great buy. I own it and I love it.  <br />Thank you!
B000063DFN|5.0|it's open for debate, but it seems like a common opinion among fans that Powerslave stands as Iron Maiden's best album; and i'd have to agree. the band sounds tighter, the songs punchier, and Bruce's vocal performance is nothing short of flawless. every song is a classic and the Egyptian Pharoah Eddie is the best variation of the grisly mascot yet.
B0000AR8NK|2.0|Station to Station,  Low,  Let's Dance; these are the classic Bowie albums.  Heck, even Outside was great.  But Reality is just a horrible album.  It's not like I want it to be horrible.  I wish it was a great album, but wishing won't make it so.  The lyrics to Never Get Old are absolutely laughable.  I love Bowie but not every album he's done is great.  You guys should learn to accept that.  The only readon I gave this two stars was because it has 'Days'.  One of Bowie's most sincere songs.  A song which many of you overlooked in your glowing reviews in favor of such turds as Never Get Old.  Maybe ballads are what Bowie should be doing now.  He still has such a lovely voice but he rarely uses it with any conviction any more.
B00005GKVS|4.0|this handsomely packaged set provides a great overview of the career of one of metal's greatest bands. there is much here for the Maiden newcomer to explore. so many of these songs are classic cuts from indispensible albums that alone merit a worthy purchase (Powerslave and Somewhere In Time being my top choices). also included here are some live versions that show how musically tight and top-notch this band is in a concert setting. the inclusion of a few Blaze era tracks provide a good glimpse at how shockingly lost and dull Iron Maiden sounded without Bruce Dickinson at the vocal helm. also included are tons of entertaining full colour photos and an exhaustive timeline. this is one for Maiden completist, or those who want to begin checking out this awesome band. of all the Iron Maiden 'best of' compilations, i'd say, Best Of The Beast is the one to get.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I just paid $20 or so for this CD (includes S/H to Korea) and it's worth every penny of it!  True, the theme music is a little redundant at times but MAN, what an album!  If this music doesn't make you want to buy a cutlass and knee-high pirate boots and fight bad guys while swinging over the deck of a 64-gun man-o-war, you haven't got a pulse!  Sure, rock and roll and Top 40 music is great but what's life without some imagination and passion?  BTW, this soundtrack sounds best played LOUD!
B0009IW88A|5.0|First, what I feel for this soundtrack is dark.  It is real dark.  It is sometime high and sometime low.  So, it will suit of what a Batman movie should be.  So, overall, this movie reflects the dark and dramatic scenes and character in this movie.  It is recommended.
B000003TA4|5.0|...And everyone knows it, even the horde of haters that don't have pen names. Get a f*%#@^ life!
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This is the best Batman movie for some time it is because everything in this movie is good. For the story, it is good because it talks about how the Batman Begins. For the acting, I can't say that Christian Bale is the best for Batman but he is suitable to act as Batman. He is somewhat better than George Clooney where he stars as Batman in \\"Batman and Robin\\" in 1997. For the direction, it is awesome because since this movie is truly exciting, no doubt to say that it is good. For the visuals, it is perfect because you know, if it is a good movie, the visual must play a part of it. So, it is good overall.  And for this two-disc deluxe edition, it is good to make this because for disc 2, I can search more about Batman and it is nice that this movie is with the comic book in it.  Therefore, it is nice to buy this.<br /><br />Till now, I have watched all my Batman movies, here is how I ranked from the best to worst:<br /><br />1. Batman Begins<br />(No doubt that it is good, it is a must-watch.)<br />2. Batman and Robin<br />(Why I ranked it second for this, not because for the casts, it is quite a relaxing one as there are some quite laughs.)<br />3. Batman Returns<br />(This movie is very memorable, especially the second half of the movie, first, the catwoman is being banished by the Penguin, then, after the city was distroyed by the Penguin, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle know their true identity to Batman and Catwoman.  During that time, Max Shreck was out of the cage and found out their true identity, he wanted to finished Batman and Catwoman off by a gun.)<br />4. Batman Forever<br />(Maybe after a few years after Batman Returns, it brings some fresh look between this and that.)<br />5. Batman<br />(After I watched this movie, it was okay and the only memorable part was the slip off from a helicopter of the joker.)
1594200696|5.0|I totally rely on Strunk.  And now it is illustrated.  For me, this is wonderful.  I can see what I sometimes can't read.  Although I improve daily.  I hope.
B000AL730O|5.0|This is one of those ALBUMS.    Driving Rain and Chaos and Creation in the Backyard are both great records.    However I find to be a better album Chaos&Creation because:    1.- I love all the songs but one, while in Driving Rain I love half of it (Lonely Road, From a lover, Driving Rain, I do, Magic, About you, Heather, Your loving Flame and Riding to Jainpur) which is not bad having so many songs on it (My fabs could do a complete album).  2.- I want to listen this record all the time while Driving Rain has its moments.    I find Driving Rain a little bit sad in essence (no matter if it rocks more as it also could mean desesperation) while this one I find it nostalgic and touchy.    Both are excellent records however.    In order to be understood by those who know and share the magic beatle universe I shall end telling which Beatle albums I want to listen all the time:    THE BEATLES  Rubber Soul,  Revolver, Abbey Road and the red and blue compilations.    Beatle JOHN  Plastic Ono Band, Imagine and the compilation Lennon Legend (Double Fantasie would have been done a good \\"Single Fantasie\\"). I would probably had more titles just if ...   Beatle GEORGE  All things must Pass, Material World, Cloud Nine and Brainwashed  Beatle RINGO  Ringo  Beatle PAUL  Ram, Band on the Run, Tug of War, Flowers in the Dirt , Flamming Pie, Wingspan and Chaos and Creation.(Also I love 'Rushes' by the fireman and the classical piece 'A Leaf')    Critics have been so hard with Paul in general and I don't understand why. His albums get better as time goes bye (McCartney and Ram were absolutely banned by critics, and loved by fans,  at their time and now are classics for critics and fans...). He has done so much production, (thanksfully!), and that means, sometimes good work and sometimes not so good . Reminds me of other big great boys : Bob Dylan,  Elvis Costello, etc ...    Anyway, what is important for me : I want to listen to it all the time and I do not get tired of it.    By the way, I love \\" A certain Softness\\" , it has got the mood of \\"And I love her\\" in senior version.    Other fabs: Too much rain (very beatle by the way, recalls Young Boy), Fine line, This never happened before, Promise to you girl (incredible! Vocals are great, vocals recall Beatles, Beach Boys and sometimes Queen, nothing bad ... you agree, sure ...), Jenny Wrenn (good, good, good ...like Blackbird and Caliko Skies), At the Mercy (moving!), and Friends to go (is he really being talked by George from the other side?! I am intrigued ... keep in touch bitte and tell us more ...).     Riding to Vanity fair is probably his personal protest against some press that has been bothering him and his wife.    Thank you so much Beatle Paul!. We love you. Please, do not stop and write music for another 20 years. Not necessarilly rockers. I don't care while it's good music.    Peace and Love in Freedom for you all
B000AYEIZY|4.0|And comparisons between three men in their mid twenties and their early sixties are just ridiculous... so forget all that and take this album for what it is. Which is what? Well first off it's most definitely not - as Eric Clapton quite rightly says in the DVD release of these concerts - some bizarre attempt to recreate Cream as they were, rather, three musicians seizing on a unique opportunity to celebrate the music they played all those years ago... different skills, different equipment, different sound, different world.     And the result... well it's got its up & downs and there's no doubt, and no surprise, that Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker can't play with the speed and intensity they did when they were \\"powerhouse\\" young men, but, in the end, it's not only a pretty good record of their concerts but an excellent album in its own right. And if comparisons need to be made then the truth is that they're slower (or is that more relaxed?) and as a result much tighter than they were in their heyday, Eric Clapton's playing on a number of the cuts is technically better and more exciting than the originals, his (and to a lesser extent Jack Bruce's) voice has a maturity & depth that's more suited to their straight Blues and R&B numbers, and... at least three (arguably more) of the tracks - \\"Crossroads\\", \\"We're Going Wrong\\" & \\"Sleepy Time Time\\" - are actually better than their original album versions. Plus you get a superb interpretation of \\"Stormy Monday\\", featuring Clapton playing at his very best, and a genuinely moving rendition of \\"Badge\\" with its quite chilling power-chord gap where George Harrison's solo should be.    Good enough then and much better than you could reasonably expect after all this time. Better still buy the DVD version, with its stunning camera-work & sound, where it's all put into context.
B000A6T1HC|2.0|I bought this recital for two reasons: 1) Minkowski conducts and 2) There are arias by Caldara, whose Maddalena ai Piedi di Cristo is the very essence of sublime.<br /><br />Notice how I didn't mention Cecilia Bartoli.  I really want to like her- I do admire her for her artistic commitment, and research into baroque music.  However, those attributes don't make up for a singing technique that is too strident and labored.  When it comes to rapid, ornate coloratura, she attacks so hard that she breaks the singing line.  There are very obvious examples of this in Opera Proibita.  Also, alas, she sings slow-moving, languid arias with an overabundance of self-conscious zeal.  Words like smooth, polish, and tonality are not part of the Bartoli vocabulary.  She about kills the slower Caldara arias, which I didn't think was possible.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong- she is a very capable singer.  I admire her Almirena, from Handel's Rinaldo.  She essayed that role very well on the Hogwood recording.  Unfortunately, whereas recital discs are concerned, she throws all caution to the wind.<br /><br />Over and over again, as I listened to Opera Proibita, I yearned for Patrizia Ciofi.  She may not have the vocal prowess of Bartoli, but her tone is much sweeter, and she is a far more obidient singer.  Bartoli tests my nerves; Ciofi sends me to the heavens. If you want evidence, check out her Idapse, from the recent recording of Vivaldi's Bajazet.
B000AL730O|5.0|What a beautiful, emotional effort.  With dense layers of lush strings and elegant splashes of piano, this album brought tears to my eyes.  Nigel Godrich shows us his natural gift of painting a morose and mysterious background in order to set the stage for McCartney's ingeniously simple lyrical approach.  The message of idyllic love has always been a theme in Paul's hopeful and optimistic writings. I discover something new every time I listen to this album.  It is an absolute masterpiece.   <br /> <br />I have noticed that some of the reviews by these insipid and lifeless burnt out ex-beatles fans have been nothing less than scathing.  An artist must grow through the years, and at least Paul chooses to take the more creative route.  It is an absolute disgrace what the music mainstream has become, so we must appreciate these classic artists before they are gone. <br /> <br />Ciao
B00005JNQA|1.0|How can a movie directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Sean Penn go wrong?  If you watch this movie, you'll quickly find out.  Or, you can take my advise and spend those 2 hours (which feels like 4) and do something else - anything else.  The suspense was non-existant, the action was minimal, and the storyline and dialogue were ridiculous.  I actually got up from my seat after the credits began rolling and started laughing. <br /> <br />I normally don't take the time to add to the amazon review bank, but with this film, I felt obligated to offer a word of caution.  How someone could recommend this movie is beyond me.
B000AL730O|5.0|Being more of a fan of George Harrison and John Lennon's solo stuff, I have anyway always enjoyed Paul's albums, his visions of optimism and light just when you need them most. His solo work has always been very irregular and a lot has been said of how Paul needed John's moody, dark, cynic humor to balance things out. Still, albums like Ram, McCartney I, Red Rose Speedway and more lately, Flaming Pie, have been enjoyed to the limit and beyond! <br /> <br />When i heard of paul'slatest album being produced by Nigel Godrich, I simply couldn't wait to order it. Not only has Godrich been essential to radiohead's beautiful \\"layered\\" sound, but to getting the best of artists like Beck, whose \\"Sea Change\\" is a an absolute modern master piece of psychodelic folk rock. Godrich combines all of this 60's pleasure of studio experimenting with a fantastic ear for crystalline-warm sound  production which is so rare now a days, but soooo welcome! Well, the results here couldn't have been better... <br />Godrich is able to bring out some pure melancholy in paul songs like never heard before! the very good material Paul presented to Nigel is treated exquisitely, with subtle, yet haunting arrangements for strings, delayed stereo guitars and double and triple pianos in semi unison.... truly fantastic! Some of the songs really stick with you like never ever before in Paul's career! The opening is wonderful with \\"Fine line\\" hammering the piano ala Hey bulldog or lady madonna; it is the most beatle song in the album, but what comes next is even better, with some of the nicest stream of songs ever, all in a row: \\"How kind of you\\"(where you can feel this first approximation to loops and layered clustered sounds Godrich has experimented with before), \\"jenny wren\\" (which i must agree with another reviewer, in its simplicity and honesty, brought tears to my eyes in the sweetest and deepest of ways), \\"At the mercy\\" (totally haunting and  some how obsessive) and \\"Friends to go\\" (which has a distant Wings sound from early 70's recordings). Like with almost all of Paul's recordings, there are always at least a couple of songs i kind of would have prefered left out... in this case, \\"english tea\\" with the ridiculous and terribly out of tune recorder, almost breaks the spell completely! but after that \\"momentary lapse of reason,\\" maybe from Godrich's side (by allowing it in), the album takes off again, climaxing with \\"riding to vanity fair,\\" which is as close as Paul will ever get to the Radio Head-Beck's sound. What a fantastic gem it is!! And as with all of Godrich's  productions, the secret here is to have a NICE stereo or sorround system to enjoy the album!! other wise, simply forget it!!! there are too many subtleties here you would miss if you don't have good sound. The production is exquisitely warm and it might well be the album that will make you buy those new decent set of speakers you were wondering about!! Thanks Paul for your unforgettable tunes...even now at 63..and thanks to Nigel for bringing it all back home! Hopefully, really, hopefully, there will be more collaborations to come. 5 stars... by the moon.
B0000WN0ZK|3.0|\\"Blow-Up\\" is a perfect example of a serious work that belongs exclusively to the time in which it was created.  The setup is wonderful -- a murder that seems to be, seems not to be, and probably actually is, on film.  And the idea of bringing the detached photographer -- who distances himself from life by staying on his side of the viewfinder -- into real engagement with other people, is also pretty swell.  But in the end it's all in service of a very dated 60s nihilism that makes the film seem to turn yellow and curl at the edges in spite of a splendid performance by David Hemmings and some exquisite photography.  When the film is over it seems naive, and the supposedly daring view of nothingness it puts forth seems as shallow and trendy as a bad period hairdo or garishly outdated clothes.
B0000019PA|5.0|This and On Avery Island give me that feeling you get at times when you're completely happy and not in the least bit self-conscious, which is what makes times like those so beautiful. A girl I met online mentioned them a lot, so I listened to one of their songs on here and thought it sounded too thick--I didn't like not being able to make out the lyrics. (This is just because it was my first time listening to the song--the lyrics aren't hard to make out at all.) Several months later I printed out the lyrics to this album and read them during school. They were interestingly weird but I didn't see how such odd lyrics could work. Then a friend played \\"Oh Comely\\" for me..and after listening to that about a million times I bought this album. <br /> <br />Put in this context, the lyrics are gorgeous. Happy and sad at the same time. So is the music. The musical saws. Mangum's voice isn't perfect, but it works. Some songs I skip over, like Two-Headed Boy parts 1 and 2, but my dislike of them gets lost in my love for the album in its entirety. The instrumental tracks are great. The first time I listened to them I thought they sounded like folk music from an imaginary country. Silly, but I'm sticking with it. Neutral Milk Hotel is dependable. Their music always makes me happy and the more tracks I listen to that aren't on this or On Avery Island, the more I love them. Even though I don't like some of their songs, it doesn't take away from my opinion of the band and their talent. <br /> <br />So, please buy this! You may not like it, but you might also love it and wish you hadn't gone so long without listening to it.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Nowdays when somebody talks of some unexpected plot twist in the ending \\"The Sixth Sense\\" is being mentioned. But before were \\"The Usual Suspects\\"... It seems that I know this movie like the palm of my hand but every time I watch the ending shivers are running down my spine. And every time I think: \\"How couldn't I guess?..\\"<br /><br />Nowdays everyone talks about how Hollywood unlearned to make movies for smart audience, that all it does now are some stupid, comics-like, PG-13 flicks. I read some review lately and author was saying something like this: \\"C'mon Hollywood, wake up, people are not that brainless\\". So here's the answer I think - \\"The Usual Suspects\\" - really clever and shrewd film. Bryan Singer did a wonderful job here maybe because he was young and unknown. Later he released \\"Apt Pupil\\" - also smart movie, and then... \\"X-Men\\", \\"X2\\", now he's filming \\"Superman returns\\" - well, it's Hollywood after all :) Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson and many others once also were making independent interesting cinema... But it's not the point here. As I said \\"The Usual Suspects\\" is a smart and intelligent film and those like it are in deficit now. Screenplay is awesome (and it deserved its Oscar), directing is beyond praise, acting Ensemble is like no other: Spacy (Academy Award too), Byrne, Baldwin, Palminteri, Del Toro, Pollak, Hedaya... God, what a cast! You will definately enjoy watching them play.<br /><br />\\"The Usual Suspects\\" is one of the best thrillers ever made, you'll never regret buying it for your collection plus the special edition has many interesting bonus features. I was never more sure giving a movie five stars.
B00000JR29|4.0|I bought this CD to replace a cassette that I had from the 80's.  I love this cd because of the music has a real beat to it and can get you moving.  The only thing I did not like about it is that they added additional tracks which were mixes.  The mixes are not the greatest songs.  Can't understand a whole lot what they are saying.  I can't even describe it.  On the whole, this is a great CD.  Great 80's music.
B0009DBXXG|3.0|I wish he had let go a real good one in Spanish!! But as some non Italian opera singers do, he swears in polite Italian, which definitely softens it for the cameras... He mutters \\"Porco Iddio!\\" (God, you pig!). What a wasted opportunity for a well placed VAFANCULO!!! <br /> <br />Snappy orchestra, excellent chorus, lots of Lenny mugging and woefully miscast principals. Kurt Ollman sings an incongruously effeminate Riff while Te Kanawa and Carreras produce some lovely sounds in completely inadequate accents. Of course, these were the the opera superstars of the early 80's. Today, this would have been done with Fleming and Villazn with comparable results. Only the late great Tatiana Troyanos holds her own as an impassionate Anita.  <br /> <br />Still, lots of fun, great sound. Worth replacing your laserdisc or VHS.
B00092ZL80|5.0|I really loved this DVD performance.  Both bands are tops, and together they set the place rockin.  I am a fan of both bands, and have been for many, many years (since earning my degree in music).  Have been fortunate to see Chicago live, even back in 1970! <br />One thing I do miss though, is the original drummer for Chicago, Danny Seraphine.  His percussion had so much energy and technique, not to mention it really filled in the gaps of the music (which I now hear with the current drummer). <br /> <br />All in all, a fine performance from both bands.  Buy it now!!!
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin's sophmore effort, Led Zeppelin II is a masterpiece. Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham, bring it all together with their second album. While their first album, showed their poptential, Led Zeppelin II blows the door open! Whole Lotta Love gets this puppy started, a great way to open the album. Other Zeppelin classics like Heartbreaker, The Lemon Song, and Living Loving Maid, are all on this wonderful album, which if you are a rock music fan you should own this!
B0002858YS|5.0|This is a GREAT Cd!!! The lyrics are exceptional and each message is unique and brilliant!  <br /> <br />The sound is very unique and most definatly has THE COOLEST lead singer EVER. *not bad looking either, I might add* <br /> <br />I was surprised and... well, rather pleased when they made 'All the things I've done' a single! The video made no sense, but it was definatly a catchy song worth mention!!! <br /> <br />The Killers are an EXCEPTIONAL and UNIQUE band! They are a breath of fresh air compared to all that crap that is big now. I am very very impressed with their CD!!!! The singles are awesome, but ALL of the songs are equal to me. <br /> <br />'Smile like you mean it' should be a single.... it's really great.
B000002JSP|3.0|Led Zeppelin's final album In Through the Outdoor is one of Zeppelin's more experimental albums. In Through the Outdoor is a little different compared to other albums from Led Zeppelin's catalog. With, In Through the Outdoor Led Zeppelin takes on a few new musical styles. While not Led Zeppelin's best album, In Through the Outdoor has some good songs to offer. Fool in the Rain, and All of My Love are the highlights, and make this album worthwhile, even though it isn't one of their better albums.
B00025ETIW|2.0|As soon as I heard everyone raving about this new band 'My chemical romance' I loved the name and decided I wanted to hear more. I first heard their song 'I'm not OK' which I deemed very Teen Angst and felt it was ok. A few of my friends wanted to see them in concert so I tagged along. After the third song, I left the house of blues!!! <br />In concert they get TIRED after the first song and sound HORRIBLE. <br /> <br />The CD was pretty good, but if you seem them live, you can tell they mess around with their voice a bit... but a few songs were good. The big ones, 'Helana' and 'I'm not ok' were rather good... but they are DEFINATLY not good enough to be as big as they are.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|Goosebumps moments:  <br />- Paul McCartney with U2 in doing Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band live for the first time ever with some faux Beatles in Pepper outfits playing french horns  <br />- U2's set including their version of Unchained Melody  <br />- Coldplay bringing out Richard Ashcroft to sing Bittersweet Symphony  <br />- Black Eyed Peas with Stephan and Rita Marley to sing Get up Stand Up  <br />- Kanye West backed by a Sting section  <br />- Dido joined by Youssou N'Dour during Thank You  <br />- The opening to Dave Matthews Band's Dreamgirl  <br />- Robbie Williams singing Angels they way it supposed to - without Jessica Simpson  <br />- Green Day covering Queen's We Are the Champions  <br />- Stevie Wonder and Adam Levane of Maroon 5 doing a duet on Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours  <br />- Pink Floyd whole set, extra Goosebumps at the beginning of each song  <br />- Maroon 5 covering Neil Young's Rockin in the Free World  <br />- Alicia Keys' tribute to Luther Vandross  <br />- Jay-Z backed by Linkin Park who did a faithful Public Service Announcement  <br /> <br />Tear Jerkers:  <br />- Bob Geldolf bring out an African Girl who, at the time of Live Aid, was only given ten seconds to live  <br />- Annie Lennox playing Why over a montage of AIDS victims  <br />- The finale in London with everyone singing Hey Jude with Paul McCartney  <br /> <br />Other interesting tidbits:  <br />- Snoop Dogg was able to get 5 F-bombs pass the MTV censors (and the N-word once). Granted he mumbles some and they weren't part of the song. The bigger slip was they Pink Floyd let the blatant word in Pink Floyd's Money or maybe they let it slip because it Floyd.  <br />- Beyonc wore a skirt that was as short as it could have been without showing off her Kootchiepop.  <br />- I was a little disappointed that no one pulled a Phil Collins this year.  <br />- The only American acts in Rome - Tim McGraw & Faith Hill?  <br />- UB40 were introduced saying they were going toperform a medley of their hits. Shouldn't it been a medley of other people's hits?  <br />- Who invited Randy Jackson? I had to laugh when I spotted him playing a tiny keyboard when Mariah Carey already had two keyboarders on stage with two large keyboards themselves.  <br />- What was up with Stevie Wonder's moustache/beard thing around his mouth? Who let him out of the house like that?  <br />- There were a lot of lyric changes to reflect the festivities including U2, Sting but my favorite was Kanye West switch the line in Jesus Walks into, \\"And George Bush gets paid off of all of that.\\"  <br />- When I saw you could download Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club from the concert on iTunes, I thought the whole concert would be available, but alas the only other song available (for now hopefully) was The Long and Winding Road.

0060930187|5.0|I've recently decided to write a review for every book I ever loved. So, yes this is written in retrospect. And perhaps I don't have all the detail written down perfectly. But if you want to read a summary, I'm afraid to inform you that I cannot give you one. I can only give you my opinion.  <br /> <br />I was quite young when I first read this; maybe 14 or 15. Perhaps I was too young to fully understand it. I was, for one, a neurotic over achiever and couldn't quite grasp that someone could have an inability not to work. But looking back, I now find myself in the same situation or rather coming out of the same situation.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to everyone, but only after you break into a few of life's tragedies and turmoil. Otherwise, there will be a void in reading this that can't be comprehended or severely hinders the reading.  <br /> <br />This was certainly written by a poet. It flows smoothly and nothing too contrive or sentences that were complicatedly constructed for the sake of being complicated. I remember fully enjoying this book.  <br /> <br />This book is as relevant today as it is was in the 60s when it was written. Things have changed, yes. But things have also remained the same. The same stresses, worries and concerns still plague many up and coming adolescents. (It's funny for me to write that sentence as one.)  <br /> <br />What I love most about this book is that it is not a moral tale warning about the rights and wrongs of life. Neither is an apologetic story. She doesn't make excuses. She tells it like it was for her. Being lost, being annoyed at being asked \\"what are you going to do with the rest of your life\\", being the odd one out, being gawky. All of this is still relevant today as it is for me.  <br /> <br />Where it loses people is when she starts to spiral down. It's a natural progression that flows smoothly downward---there was never one big incident or anything that explain any such thing. It doesn't try to prod in the physiological of the matter. It's like a first hand account of an accident about to occur where the person can't explain what is about to happen. She just knows she is going to crash.  <br /> <br />I'm not saying you have to be depressed or a wounded human being to read this. No. No one is perfect; everyone has problems. If you're young, maybe give this books a few years. But if you've lived some, then read this. This is not a story to be missed. Easy. Deep. Mesmerizing.
B00005AQF7|5.0|KIDS WHAT IS GOING TO BE FIRST ON YOUR BIRTHDAY OR CHRISTMAS LISTS THIS YEAR, CORRECT SNOOP DOGG'S \\"DOGGYSTYLE\\". The rap legend puts out a classic cd, one that would be loved many, many years after its release. Five stars for Doggystyle, no wait ten, twenty, ect... This album is filled with amazing beats, great rhymes, and more amazing lyrics. There are countless classics on this once a career cd. I'll cut straight to the point and let you see my personal top five favorites, which is quite hard in a cd like this.  <br /> <br />1. Who Am I( What's My Name)- Obviously the dominating track on this cd, decent length, amazing tune, beats, lyrics, and more. This song has it all.  <br />2. Gin and Juice- In my opinion the second best track on \\"Doggystyle\\", yet could probably hold the number one spot on almost any other cd. Great Beat, that's what really makes this song good, and very good lyrics also.  <br />3. Tha Shiznit- Another well put together song, lengthwise, and the rhythm in this song, amazing.  <br />4. The G Funk Intro- A beat that is somewhat similar to \\"Tha Shiznit\\", this song has a nice catchy beat.  <br />5. Doggy Dogg World- In my opinion not near as good as the first four in my order but definetly nothing that will let you down. This is another great track, that almost sounds a little softer than other tracks on the album.  <br /> <br />Those are my top five. But i still think the whole album should get good recognition. I have been lucky enough to actually meet the legend Snoop Dogg himself, and I can tell you that this man worked hard on this album. I hope what i have told you here will help persuade you to get the album. Five stars up for \\"Doggystyle\\".  <br /> <br />This would be a Rap album that would go down in history. This had a countless amount of singles, with songs that would get played on the radio 15 years later. Many people do not understand the power of this album. <br /> <br />People listen up. If you loved this album, and want something just like it, don't just go out and buy another Snoop album, although that wouldn't be a bad idea. GO OUT AND BUY THE CHRONIC BY DR. DRE WHICH FEATURES SNOOP IN OVER 1/2 THE SONGS, AND IS JUST ABOUT AS HOT AS THIS ALBUM. Please if you want don't forget to read and grade my other reviews, if you would like.  <br /> <br />PIRATE  <br />
B00005R2IS|4.0|Would anyone have dubbed Alex from \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" just because he used a bizarre, otherwordly form of English?  Or how about the childish drawl of Forrest Gump or Brando's slurred rasps in \\"The Godfather?\\"  Of course not!  They were integral parts of the characters, the settings, and the times of those films.  So why, WHY were the distinctive, wonderful accents and slang of the Australian characters in the U.S. version of \\"Mad Max\\" dubbed over with, apparently, the voices of bland, Midwestern newscasters? Did the film's U.S. distributors think they'd fool us?  That American audiences would hear Matt Lauer's voice coming out of Mel Gibson as he raced across the deserts of the Australian outback and not think, \\"Hey! Those 'Americans' are driving on the wrong side of the road . . . and their steering wheels are on the wrong side, too!?\\"  <br /> <br />Fortunately, this DVD resurrects the outstanding, original voices of the Australian actors and actresses, coming through, crisp and clear, in stereo, rather than the \\"Hercules-in-New-York\\"-ish mono of the American dubbing.   <br /> <br />If you've seen \\"Mad Max\\" before, and hated it or even just thought it was so-so, take a chance on this DVD and see it again in \\"Australian-English.\\"  It's an almost totally different movie.  Believe me -- I didn't particularly like it the first time I saw the dubbed, U.S. version, either.  If you loved it, (pardon the cliche) see it again for the first time. You'll be transported into the surreal world of Australian outback biker slang that George Miller intended.  And, trust me -- Mel Gibson sounds a LOT better with his own voice than that of the mellow, sedating NPR commentator (I can only suppose) they found to dub him.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|This album is a bit problematic.  There's no lack of modern female Celtic performers who are producing superb work - Maire Brennan, Enya, Loreena McKennitt (yes, thank God, there is going to be another McKennitt album) and Karan Casey among others.  So one's attention is always drawn to a new offering.<br /><br />This album features M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Nesbitt, M&eacute;av N&iacute; Mhaolchatha, &Oacute;rla Fallon, Lisa Kelley, Chloe Agnew, and Dierdre Shannon.  All are talented musicians better known in Ireland than they are here in the states.  All of them sing and play well and from a performance viewpoint this is a well-produced album.<br /><br />It's the choice of music that leaves something to be desired.  Now Danny Boy, Ave Maria, and Someday are pretty songs to be sure, and so are all the others chosen, but I would have liked to hear these wonderful voices sing closer to the root if you will and undertake some more complex and original material.<br /><br />The album is intended to please on a 'superficial' level, and it succeeds within its boundaries.  You can plop it into your player and listen to it for hours.  But I can do the same thing with Loreena McKennitt and always wind up awed.  So if you are looking for a nice Celtic hour or so stop here for as long as you want.  If you want to understand what Celtic women have really accomplished go on from here to the names I have listed.
B000784WMW|1.0|The horrible quality of this production is a disgrace. It reminds me of when grandma watched Dark Shadows. The interior shots look like a bad soap opera. I kept praying for more exterior shots so I could see some sort of quality. If you are thinking this will be a Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice, trust me you will run SCREAMING for the nearest moor. Timothy Dalton, an outstanding actor in my opinion, loses all appeal. Even he can't overcome the tragic quality of direction, lighting, sound and set. But really who could.   <br />
B00005JO0J|4.0|I was initially hesitant to go see this film because of the rabid fan base.  I expected the hype to be overblown.  I read a review by Orson Scott Card (multiple Hugo award winner)  and decided it was a must see.  I have to agree with OSC, it is quite possibly one of the finest Sci Fi films that I have ever seen. <br /> <br />This is a film with multiple layers.  Its about people who somehow resemble the people I know.  Some people are driven blindly by ideology.  Others find themselves not driven by right and wrong, but by survival; trying to find control in situations manipulated by outside forces. <br /> <br />The action is intense and the fight scenes fantastic.  Humor abounds in the relationships of these characters.  The first minutes of the film are some of the best backstory filling that I've ever seen done.  I didn't need to see the original series to enjoy this film.   <br /> <br />The only draw back was that initally the speech patterns took some getting used to.  After I was used to the cadence of their lingo, I found it charming. <br /> <br />
B000AL730O|5.0|This is a CD that I firmly enjoy, the songs while not being the equal of some of McCartney's earlier work (with or without the Beatles) are quite good.  Would you enjoy this CD?  Probably.  Is anything here going to replace Hey Jude as McCartney's number one hit?  Not a chance.  Still I'd say definitely add this to your collection if you enjoy his music.
0060974176|3.0|This book is certainly a kind of milestone in the auto literature history. Yet, for today's readers it is probably not the first choice to read. The huge impact the book had and its benefit is that it rightly lifts the Toyota production system (TSP) to the status of the Ford assembly line and other revolutionary inventions in production organisation. It declares TSP as the successor of Fordian mass production.  <br /> <br />There were books about the TPS before, notably the book of Taiichi Ohno in the mid-1980s, one of the principal creators of TSP, but the audience was not sure about its real significance. TSP came a long way from the 1950s and its development was evolutionary rather than instantaneous. Its deployment was painstaking and required a lot of Japanese perseverance. The Japanese deserve all the credit for pulling that through. With this book the MIT plays a kind of authority in the history of production technology and bestows TSP official recognition. For today, the book is still interesting to read from a historical perspective but if you want to get into the details of the history of TSP Fujiomoto's \\"Evolution of a Manufacturing System' is probably the best choice today.  <br /> <br />The problem with \\"the machine that changed the world\\" (besides its title) is that is to one-side and totally uncritical of the Japanese manufacturers. This was probably necessary to ring the alarm bells at the time but it was not justified. The decade following the publicaton of the book would show that the Toyota system involved certain risks and idiosyncracies of the Japanese market context. (It is interesting to note that only Cusamano, who worked on the product development part of the MIT project without being an author of the book, acknowledges the high risk of escalating design costs that would later push Nissan to the verge of bankruptcy). For Madzda and Mitsubishi TPS was very problematic as well. While the authors are totally concentrating on production systems,which is ok, it is not the single success factor in auto industry as the authors implicitly suggest. They almost treat cars as a commodity, exchangeable, only attributed by quality and certain design criteria. The ranking the book presents is based on production efficiency (first, Japanese, second come US firms, and the Europeans are the worst of the worst). Yet, it makes it very difficult to understand the sustained success of the French and German car industry. Admittingly, the UK industry went downhill, but at the same time Spain became one of the biggest auto production location in the world. What the authors (professors of production technology) neglect is that the European market and the Japanese market are very different from the US market.  <br />First, local markets have very different preferences. Auto companies in Europe, Japan and the US have a strong home market advantages by perceiving and responding to these home preferences much earlier. Second, local requirements are very different as Porter notices in his book about the competitive advantage of nations. For instance, German autobahns require top performance, high fuel prices in Europe make European cars more fuel efficent and so on. The real success of the Japanese in the US came when they started to develop cars solely for the US market needs which were then manufactured with the quality the TSP system achieves.  <br />As a result of the Japanese focus on the US market, they were never really successful in Europe, where performance, innovative technology and design ranks somehow relatively higher than in Japan and the US.  <br /> <br />Yet, Toyota's sustained global success indicates that they have created a marvellous production system that is worth studying. But it is not very easy to understand in all its parts, that is has not been until today fully adopted by companies outside Japan demonstrate its complexity or dependence on the Japanese market context
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I didn't realize how many of their songs I knew!  I started to watch this on TV and realized that I wanted to see all of it and without commercials.  It was worth every penny.  I enjoyed it and will enjoy it many more times to come, I am sure!
1400034779|4.0|An endearing story. The protagonist, Precious Ramotswe, is the owner of the only Ladies' Detective Agency in all of Botswana. While she tries her best to deliver exemplary service, she sometimes falls a little short of the mark. Her sometimes bumbling investigatory tactics, however, make her one of the most affable characters I've met in quite some time. Her cases are varied and her \\"hunches\\" lead her to solve several cases - like the woman whose husband went missing. On a hunch, Mma Ramotswe decides to wrestle and kill an alligator to determine if the contents of its stomach includes any belongings from the missing man. Incredible technique, but it worked for her!<br /><br />This story was a quick read and has prompted me to read more in Alexander McCall Smith's series. I would recommend the book for light reading that is different, creative and quite entertaining.
B0001CNRBG|3.0|I saw this movie many years ago and absolutely loved it.  It doesn't hold up quite as well as I hoped but it is still enjoyable.  And the opening song - Johnny Mathis and someone whose name I can't think of - is still great!
B0000CFW87|5.0|WOW! This is the first album I have bought by Josh, and I have to say, The young man is nothing short of a blessing from God Himself, What a Voice what passion comes through his songs, even the songs not in english. I really liked the song You raise me up and decided to get this album and I was a bit skeptical about buying the album due to the songs in other languages and I have come a long way from that thought now as my favourite song on this album is Oceano  whish is Italian. If you like passionate, beautiful heart felt music, what are you waiting buy this album and buy it now so you won't regret anymore days without it.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I saw this on PBS and HAD TO HAVE IT.  I bought the DVD and the CD and I play the CD almost daily in my car.  I love the choices of songs and the voices of the women on the CD.  I love it so much I'm going to their concert!
B000002GJ7|5.0|I've listened and heard this band since I was 8 years old(in 1992). This was my first favourite band. Of course there have been many many bands and artists after that. Now I am more with jazz and blues music because I play blues/jazz myself too.. <br /> <br />But I have to say, that from 1992 (when I first heard this album) to this day, this might be the cd I've played most in my cd-player.  <br /> <br />Pornograffitti, yes. Maybe this is the best funkmetal album ever. Maybe, or maybe not?! Well, I think it IS.  <br /> <br />This is very uneven album, like a rollercoaster, and that's one reason I like it so much. It's got rough funkmetal like with some big band, good frank sinatra-type jazz song. And maybe I'm still liking it very much in this day cos' there are much horns in this album, and I play horns myself, to be honest not \\"horns\\", just saxophone and bass clarinet. Very good professionals in the band - I'm not going to put Nuno front in review like a Jesus, because I think the band works just great together. Without three others Nuno would be nothing and without Nuno the band wouldn't be as catchy and interesting.  <br /> <br />Especially I've played title-song. It's very hard funkmetal song.  It's got pretty clever solo played by Nuno, which sounds like you were walking in red district lights area, near whores, beasts and lust. And Gary Cherone's singing is very powerful in this song. Also Paul and Pat are funking this metal forward. Very smooth song, you can dance and jump around with this flow song, althought it's metal!!  <br /> <br />Other highlights in my opinion are Li'l jack horny, When I'm president get the funk out, It's (a monster), when I first kissed you, Suzi, He-man woman hater and of course song for love where Pat does great bass-solo. <br /> <br />Little bouring songs are: More than words, Hole hearted.. And those were the only hit songs in this album!! Kiss my *** people, hah!! <br /> <br />I think this is the best band ever and the CD is onethe best, because it is so full of heart, which is most important thing. Heart to do excellent music.. <br /> <br />Unfortunately I didn't have change to catch the band when it was in Finland. I was so young back then. <br /> <br />But not best artist, when we are counting jazz-, blues- and funkartists to this list.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|\\"Unplugged\\" from Alicia Keys is long overdue. I assumed that she would release a live album after \\"Songs in A Minor\\", but I guess it was worth the wait. The stand out track on this masterpeice, is obviously \\"Unbreakable\\", the lead single from the album. I think that it was a smart move on Clive Davis and Alicia for choosing that song as the first single. The rest of the album is just as good. I love the way she has rearranged some of her hits, in a way that makes them brand new again. I love it and if you are reading this, the clips on CDNOW is not enough, go get the full effect! LET\\"S MAKE THIS ALBUM A DIAMOND RECORD!
B00005J6T0|4.0|This is another Madonna classic.Although some songs sound like something off a Super Mario game or something.\\"Papa Don't Preach\\" is what drived me to this album.\\"Open You Heart\\" is another koooo Madonna song.It makes you just want to get up and dance!\\"La Isla Bonita\\" is a slow song with some latin spice added to it.\\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" is just Silly Silly.This album is really kooo!!!
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I'm usually the hardcore type.  The Bled, Every Time I Die, As I Lay Dying, Throwdown.  That type of stuff.  But I love The OC and it got played some on there.  I picked up Transatlanticism and was blown away.  I heard about a new Death Cab cd coming out so I immediately ran out and picked it up.  Wow is all I have to say.<br /><br />The CD is just great in all realms.  It's moving, emotional, and can pull at your heartstrings.  It's not overally dramatic either which I like.  The songs are layered in a way to give you this comfortable feeling.  It is a slightly depressing sounding album but one that should not be passed up.  Give it a chance and you will not be sorry.
B000099T2L|4.0|To be honest I've only listened to tracks 1-7.I think they are koooo!!!Beyonce's #1 album and her first solo-album is not quite good like I thought it would be.Mainly because some songs bored me to death.But the beggining makes you just wanna get up and dance!Then tracks 8-15 make you wanna weep you tears out.Beyonce has an awesome voice and she's really good at making videos!Her music is the bomb,especially \\"Crazy In Love\\".My favorite songs are:Crazy In Love,Baby Boy,Yes,Hip Hop Star,Be With You,Naughty Girl,Speechless,That's How You Like It,Dangerously In Love 2 and Gift From Vergo.I'm looking forwards to getting Beyonces next album also Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams and also Destiny's Child #1's.Overall this album gets 100/100 because of the cover art.It's really tight!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie has passion, tenderness, poignancy, and humor. You are exposed to people of different classes, ethnicities, and general backgrounds in order to take a closer look at what \\"love\\" is. <br /> <br />You see the arrogant ex-rock star (Bill Nighy) trying to make a comeback and any cost and is chubby but likeable manager who is always there to support him. There's a prime minister (Hugh Grant) who is torn about his feelings for Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), the inconveniently beautiful head of his catering staff. After going through a horrible break up, we watch a B novelist (Colin Firth) discover love while writing his novel in France. Then there are married couples, best friends, siblings, parents, and children. As you can tell, the cast is top notch. It's a veritable who's who of British Cinema and every part is played to perfection.  <br /> <br />What this movie does is to show how we have incredibly human experiences that tie us into something deeper. Sometimes, there is incredible pain and loss when we fall in love--or out of love--but no matter what happens, love strengthens us and reminds us that we are alive.  <br /> <br />The DVD is fabulous because there are tons of extras in it. I've had the joy of watching it all and I love it. If you like Sam and  Daniel (the father and son), you'll love the full cut of their story. There is actually 8 minutes of Sam, most of which was not in the theatrical film. I won't give away what's in it, but that is my top pick of extras to watch from the DVD. There are also hilarious bits if you watch the version of the movie with audio commentary by the director and several cast members. Hugh Grant is particularly funny in this, particularly when he talks about Colin Firth! If you are a lover of soundtracks, there is also a good section where the director goes into detail about each of the primary songs he picked in the film and why. <br /> <br />If you enjoyed this movie, buy it!! It makes a fabulous gift and you can watch it over and over and still see something new or have a good laugh!
B00000I41J|5.0|As of now 36 customer reviews and an average of 5 stars. Something tells me this is a jazz classic ! The featured quintet is a who's who of jazz greats, check it out. The music stands on it's  own merits and would pass any blinfold test by unknowing ears as to it's authenticity and maybe even as to  who is playing. Of course on the opening notes of the standard \\"Autumn Leaves\\" any jazz aficionado would recognize the essence of  the cool Miles Davis's licks. Another standard  featured,  \\" Love For Sale, \\" made famous by Lady Day is more uptempo, not as melancholy as Billie Holiday's version and dispalys a more swinging interpretation.  The title track \\"Something Else\\" walks the tightrope between hard bop and cool  jazz with an affirmative rebirth. Nat Adderly is adept and versatile on this disc, showing his ability to integrate and utilize superb and diverse musicians for a cohesive uniform sound throughout the disc. The bonus track \\"Bangoon\\" is a lost treasure revived from the vaults and given the masterful treatment by Rudy Van Gelder. The disc has been remastered to beyond perfection and includes original liner notes  and an additional essay by  Bob Blumenthal that compliments the original . Great timeless music that has been given the sonic once over for the digital age. Highly recommended to any jazz collection.
0307276902|3.0|The badest of the bad in addiction.  A fantastic book for the loved ones of addicts.  A hope for those who have totally given up, both the loved ones and the addicted.  I know,--been there, done that.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I loved this DVD,as it brought back memories of my school days.Achilles,and Hector both my heros.The trajedy of the film settings distroyed by the hurricane in Mexico,and Brad Pitt's injury in his Achille's tendon,made the movie harder to make.Never giving up it was very well done.It is very hard to make epic movies these days as people really are not interested.Only those who love ancient history will enjoy.The best and hardest part is the fight between Achilles and Hector.
B000002IMG|5.0|There's nothing to say about this album that hasn't been already said. <br />Great vocals,great riffs,great solo's(of course),great drums, <br />great bass,every thing you could ask for in a thrash album.
6305971951|4.0|MIchael Pare was the star of this sci fi prequel, even though he had made only one movie previously.  My son Jeff asked who I thought was handsome, and I replied \\"the actor in 'The Philadelphis Story.'  Justin corrected me, \\"It's 'The Philadelphia Experiment' you watch all the time.  Cary Grant was handsome, but Pare reminded me of the football player at Central High I had a big crush on, Jim Darling.  So, to feel young again, I would watch this flick on cable t.v. <br /> <br />He played a sailor with a sidekick who were on a naval vessel out in the Philadelphia harbor which was used in an experiment to make it 'invisible' by radar.  It not only knocked the ship off the radar, it vanished back in time.  Michael and his sidekick were transported forward in time to the desert in California where they found things weird to say the least. <br /> <br />They were rescued by Nancy Allen, who went on to make other such movies, and reunited with the old people who were young when the experiment 'failed.'  They had no aged one iota. <br /> <br />It was a bit before the time for such ideas to catch on.  It wasn't the idea behind the story, but the actor who carried this futuristic movie.  He was good, and made other features, then fell by the wayside after playing Sandra Bullock's ex-husband in 'Hope Floats.'
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I have always admired and liked Neil Young as far back as I can remember, and for several reasons; he sang Canadian, he sang with a heart and he cared about what he was singing.  Like Dylan, his voice was not polished, but poetic, was not fine-tuned but well-worn. Now decades later, listening to Prairie Wind, nothing has changed.  From the lyrical, light and lovely \\"Painter\\" to the reverent and thoughtful \\"When God Made Me\\", Neil Young is the ultimate musical storyteller. There is an air of humility that brands this album, perhaps from his recent bout with a brain aneurysm or simply a thankfulness for having 50 plus years and making music.  Prairie Wind is an enlightenment of Neil Young's life journey and I couldn't help get the feeling he invited me along for the walk.
B00004TDRD|1.0|What can I say. This movie is not only stupid, but also insensitive. Along with the fact that the acting was terrible, and the music was cheesy, I need to add something else. I am, along with being a big cat, hyena, and wolf lover, also a shark lover. Sharks are both cool and beautiful. This piece of trash shows sharks as something they are not-bloodthirsty, sadistic killers who kill for fun and destroy anything they please. Hey, humans. How about the fact that over 1,000,000 sharks died because of humans, but only 100 humans died because of sharks? How about the fact that sharks have difficulties and feelings just like we do? How about the fact that this movie is an attempt to make people hate sharks, when they should be helping them? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who likes this movie is insensitive to the cruelties sharks have had to go through. A message to the director Steven Speilberg-YOU MAKE ME SICK!!!!!!!!!! If it were up to me, every copy of this movie and any other movie meant to make hate to any cool predator would be rocketed into space forever. And I don't give a (BEEP)that many people liked this movie. They just don't see what I see. I can't believe I ever watched this stupid s--t. If you are a shark lover, or an animal lover of any sort, do not see this movie. It is just another way to represent sharks as evil. And Steven Spielberg is a jerk. A very big jerk. Boy, how he makes me PUKE! Anyway, nuff said. Don't see this work of insensitivity.
1401300901|2.0|I looked forward to this book based upon the description.  I was hoping for something heartwarming and thought provoking.  Sadly, it ws neither. <br /> <br />The writing can only be described as tedious.  Normally, a very fast reader, I struggled to get through this.  The characters lacked any three dimensionality to them and the plot was contrived. <br /> <br />I also lent this to a friend, who had much the same things to say about it. <br /> <br />Too bad.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is the ultimate, best of Foo Fighters, that you could want. <br /> <br />I've seen so many comments I want to refute, and would take them one on one, but they're too numerous. <br /> <br />I would like to say, most of all, first - For those of you who bitch about the DRM/copy protection, if you were able to get an Amazon account and post comments on this album, you've spent as much if not more effort to do that as is required to bypass the trivial effort required to listen and rip this to MP3. <br /> <br />On the music merits, which is where we should be focusing, this is a great album.  There are two CDs in this set - one hard rock, and one mellow acoustic. <br /> <br />Both are excellent in both regards.  The first CD is really hard rock - and I think tracks 4 (DOA) - 8 (Free Me) are the definite tracks, balls out, the hardest songs Foo Fighter have ever released is an understatement.  There are some mellower hard rock tracks, but I think they've got it right. <br /> <br />Then CD2, all acoustic - wow, what a change.  Some really beautiful songs, such as \\"What if I Do\\" and \\"Razor\\". <br /> <br />It's amazing the difference, and you should appreciate it, like a rainy day type of album, very beautiful music and you should appreciate it an just mellow out on all the tracks. <br /> <br />To get both the hard rock and electric acoustic as a double CD is a gift, truly.  Appreciate it as such, it's a great album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0385338686|3.0|I love Sophie Kinsella and usually find her books to be hysterical and sweet.  This one was just not in the same caliber.   <br /> <br />The plot is rather predictable with regard to Samantha and Nathaniel's relationship.  Other parts of the plot are ridiculous-really why would a high-powered career girl go to work as a maid?   <br /> <br />Despite these flaws, parts of the book made me laugh and I still raced through it. <br /> <br />Worth a read as long as you are not expecting the fun of the Shopaholic series.
0307276902|4.0|I would never in a million years have picked this book. I even was holding out when Oprah picked it as it isn't available in Australia. BUT a Friend recommended the book to me and I decided to splash out. Even with overseas mail priceing, It was the BEST book I have ever read. (Biography)<br /><br />Easy to read, the subejst is confronting and hard to imagine, that the author is still alive. You read his story wondering 'How did you survive?' We sit in his head as experience his rage and hate and feel his pain. You will not put the book down until the end. And when you finish it, you will read it again and recemmend it to everyone you know and even strangers.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I first discovered Gavin DeGraw back in July 2004 randomly while flipping through radio stations on the way to work.  They were playing \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" on one of the contemporary adult mix stations and I was immediately captivated by the soulful rock vibe of the song.  I felt like I'd also heard it before and eventually realized I had (while flipping through channels as the theme of one tree hill...but never watched the show so couldn't put two and two together).  The whole day at work I had the song stuck in my head...I didn't know the name of the song (though I figured it was something similar to \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\"), nor did I know the artist but I was officially obsessed. (I thought about it all day long).    I went home that night and looked all over the internet and literally found and downloaded every song of Gavin Degraw's I could...and was basically in love.  Gavin DeGraw is truly talented with one of the most amazing soulful, jazz-inspired voices I've ever heard...like a mix between an r&b singer and a rocker (along the lines of the lead singer of Maroon 5, possibly some Jason Mraz-ish) and very instrumentally sound (he plays either the piano or guitar in every song).  The very next day I went out and bought Chariot Stripped (I downloaded it first because I was skeptical, I only like to buy music of artists I actually want to support).      The best part about buying Chariot Stripped (the double set), is that the Stripped CD takes some completely new takes on some already amazing songs and Gavin demonstrates how utterly wonderful his voice truly is (The most two amazing vocals on either CD are in the Stripped version of \\"More Than Anyone\\" and the cover of \\"Change Is Gonna Come\\")  ... Since my first listen to Gavin Degraw (July 2004) this CD is STILL my most listened to CD.  No matter how many times I listen to it, how much I sing to it, and how many friends I turn on to Gavin DeGraw, I never ever get sick of it.  What's also amazing is that the CD came out in July 2003 (a year before I even heard of it) and it's still selling and producing new singles.      If you intend to buy this cd make sure to put it on repeat...The weird thing about Gavin DeGraw, is that by the time the last chord fades away on \\"Overrated\\" you're pining to hear the first chord of \\"Follow Through.\\"      There's not a single track I don't like on the Chariot CD.  On the Stripped CD, the slower version of \\"Overrated\\" is a little too slow for me, but loving 22/23 tracks on 2 cds...(11 of them being alternate versions of the exact same songs)...that's pretty damn good.    Oh yeah, If you're gonna check him out online, look up his cover material...He pulls off some of the most amazing covers I've ever heard (Marvin Gaye's \\"Let's Get It On,\\"  Sam Cooke's \\"Change Is Gonna Come\\" and Queen's \\"We Are The Champions.)     As for the CD...buy it, believe me it'll be worth your while.  If you like soul/jazz music, you'll enjoy it.  If you like pop/rock music, you'll enjoy it.  Look past the fact that now that he's gotten \\"Big\\" a lot of teenage girls on TRL are into him...so what...he's had a cult following for the last 2 years off of the same CD that teenage girls are eating up today...My father (who is 63) heard it playing in my car and asked me about him, telling me that whoever he was, he had one hell of a voice.  Gavin DeGraw is a style all his own, and one that anybody who hasn't heard is definitely missing out on.    (BTW if you like Gavin DeGraw DEFINITELY check out The Fray's album \\"How To Save A Life\\"...the song that will hook you is \\"Over My Head (Cable Car)\\"... smash written all over it).
B0009HLDFU|4.0|The first disc of this release is pretty good. It has the typical Foo Fighters sound, which is good, but they don't really head into any new territory. It's closer to \\"One by One\\" than the two releases before it. If you like the Foo Fighters you will want to buy this disc. If you are just starting to get into them you need to buy \\"The Color and the Shape\\" and \\"One by One\\" before you get this one. The second disc of this release is all acoustic and it flat out stinks. I respect the courage in trying this out, but the band needs to stick with what works. Generally, the more the Foo Fighters rock out the more I like them. Hopefully they won't try to head further into the acoustic direction in the future. They are too good of a band to be wasting their time with it.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|From the moment I 1st started listen to this CD. I was Captivated from the 1st note to the last. I have yet to see the show.  I will be seeing the cast in Chicago in just a few weeks. I recommend this CD to anyone who loves theatrical music. Even if theatre isn't normally your thing, I think the music from wicked just might make a theatre person out of you! Just like Phantom brought out the Opera fan in all of us, who would never have listened to opera. Wicked just might bring out the theatre person hidden inside you! This is the best musical sense Phantom, hands down. Buy it, you Will love it!
B000641ZA4|4.0|This is a very fine DVD of Genesis' entire music video anthology. Sure there are no extras, not even an interview with the remaining members (Rutherford and Banks), but the videos stand on their own merits and make the DVD very entertaining. <br /> <br />However, I must report one minor but important omission, and it's during the \\"Land of Confusion\\" video, arguably one of the best videos in this anthology. Apparently in the remastering of the audio of this video, they erased all the SFX and dialogue from the Spitting Image puppets, leaving only the beginning and end vignettes intact. Why they did this is a mystery to me, but it kind of ruined the video for me, having seen it about 50 times in my life since it came out and it being one of my all-time favorite music videos by any artist.  <br /> <br />That aside though, the DVD is still worth your money if only to get all of Genesis' videos, including the three produced for their last album Calling All Stations with Ray Wilson replacing Phil Collins which are admittedly very interesting. I just can't in good conscience give it 5 stars because of the Land of Confusion video.

0307276902|5.0|This book was very well written.  It really gives a person insight into addiction and withdrawal.  As a high school teacher I found it very informational.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I really liked the first two coldplay albums but i really struggle to listen to this. The main problem is problem is not the music which, while not up to their previous standards is ok. The thing I can't get past is the lyrics, they generally just sound very contrived and cliched. I also don't think they have evolved at all since their first album the songs all still follow the same formula. <br /> <br />If you liked there previous effort this is more of the same just not as good. <br />
B000002MP2|1.0|Utter rubbish as John \\"Johnny Rotten\\" Lydon would've said.  GD is who we purist punk enthusiasts have to thank for ushering in the MTV-ready wave of wanna-be punk bands of the mid-late '90's which the music industry was seeking to mainstream after to extend the success of alternative formats in that sorry era I call radio-friendly post-grunge formula alternative.  Once the record companies zeroed in on the formula, they milked it for what it was worth and Green Day were plucked to lead the charge.  Sure, there's plenty of loud, fast 3-chord distortion --complete with minimal guitar solos if present at all-- to be found on this CD as one would expect with a band proclaiming themselves punk.  This generation of latterday wanna-be puns certainly has the dress-code and playbook down, but punk was relevent as a musical movement at a specific time, the late '70's and early '80's - I'm happy with my Clash, Ramones, X, Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Dead Kennedy's and Germs Cds, tapes and vinyl and don't need wanna-bes like Green Day nad whatever else passes for punk these days. <br /> <br /> <br />--Oi!!!
B000929AJQ|4.0|I ordered this album more off of the strength of \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" single than anything else.  I've played it at least once a day in the couple of weeks that I've had it now, and I'm continually finding new things that I like about it. <br /> <br />I've always been a semi-fan of NIN, in that I have liked what I've heard but I'd heard some very unflattering things about Trent, presumably because he was both unhappy and under the influence of chemicals (liquid and solid).  I recently read an interview with him in the British press where he'd talked about straightening out his life to where and his music wasn't happy, but he seemed a nice, affable guy.  So, I decided to give NIN another try, as I admired his honesty and candor. <br /> <br />I find \\"With Teeth\\" to be a very mature work of a very introspective artist, and I've just ordered \\"The Downward Spiral\\" today as a result.  I'm interested in comparing the two. I found Trent and Rick Rubin's production of the album to be multi-faceted without being showy--sometimes producers just shout \\"Look at me; I'm so laden down with production tricks and I just had to whip them out and show you!\\" but not here.  I keep finding things about the way this record was produced that make me wonder how they could have done it all in as little as eight months. \\"All the Love in the World\\" is a strong start to the album; good lyrics and just as I'm about ready to start getting bored with the melody, here comes some beautiful piano into the mix and it took me about nine or 10 times of listening to this song before I could even make it to the next one.  I won't do a song-by-song rundown, but \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" reminds me of Orwell's \\"1984.\\"  One of my favorites on the album.  I can't quite make up my mind what my favorite song is, although I'd say that \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" impresses me the least--there's just nothing that makes me remember it.  \\"Right Beside You in Time\\" is a stunner; it's duking it out daily between\\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" and the album's final song, \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" for My Favorite Song on the record.  \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" has the couplet \\"And if you look at your reflection/Is it all you wanted to be?\\" How many songwriters can write anything half this good in twice as many words?  I also really liked how the roaring of the adoring crowd (NIN fans?) is played in the background as Trent sings \\"What if <br />everything around you/Isn't quite as it seems?\\" Fame and fortune do not happiness make. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm fortunate in that I'm buying this record first and then working my way backwards.  But then again, perhaps I'm just seeing things differently because my expectations aren't there to automatically compare this record to \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" or \\"Downward Spiral.\\"  I do know this:  I'm darned picky about what I buy these days because I don't like spending my money on dreck, and there's a ton of it out there.  This is a CD well worth the investment I made in it.  I look forward to seeing what Trent does next. <br /> <br />I will say that I am disappointed with having bought the CD/DVD.  I thought the video portion was going to be more than <br />just the standard run-of-the-mill lip sync version of \\"The Hand That Feeds.\\"  I find videos to be stupid and a waste of time (mine and the artist's) to begin with.  Music should stand on its own; not because a video made it better or worse.  I was hoping for a bit of live footage, but no, just the standard Empty-Vee feed, I assume. I could have gone to the NIN website <br />for the rest of the information on the DVD side; I guess I'll <br />just have to catch 'em in concert to see what they're like live.
0156027321|5.0|A few years ago I asked my high school English teacher for a good book recommendation, and Life of Pi was the first he suggested. I was immediately attracted to the theme and was engrossed throughout the book. <br /> <br />The scenario in the book--being trapped on board a lifeboat with several animals, including an enormous Bengal tiger--is one that is wildly improbable, but Yann Martel presents it in a way that makes it seem almost possible. I fully recommend this to anybody in the mood for a good read.
0930289234|5.0|This and the dark knight returns are my very favourite graphic novels, but this one takes the cake! This comic masterpiece is written by the english master Alan Moore, and illustrated by the english artist Dave Gibbons. This graphic novel is set in an alternate future where nixon is still president, America won Vietnam and super heros are banned. One of the retired super heros is mysteriosly murdered, so Rorschach (an insane hero) sets out to investigate. He then suspects a mask murderer is set to kill the last remaining super heros. This book is the best thing on the comic shelf. You also get value for money with this title (it has 450 pages), this maxi series changed the comic medium and inspired lots of modern writers today.This title is in Time magazine's 100 best english written novels of all time. Don't hesitate with this title, you will NOT be dissapointed. I guarentee you.
B00004W3L3|5.0|Even non-progressive rock fans will enjoy this one, just on the melodic strength of the compositions.  My only disappointment is that these songs are not longer.  Take, for example, Kayleigh or Lavender, or pretty much any of the other mini-tunes on the disk... any of these could easily have been stretched out to 3-5 minutes and I would have thoroughly enjoyed every sweet melodic note.  At the same time, though, I must admit that turning Misplaced Childhood into a string of chart-toppers would deny the album its creative genius.  It is what it is, and it is an incredible composition.  Fish's lavish lyrics are notorious for their heavy dose of poetic stylization - sometimes a study in metaphore, simile, double entendre, vocabulary.  But here the lyrical backflips are toned down just enough to make the music shine, while still getting the message across poetically.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|Bob Dylan - No Direction Home is a great DVD for anyone interested in creative process. For those who are unfamilar with Dylan it provides a fine summary of his early days in NYC and shows his impact on the music of the early 60's. For Dylan fans, it provides rare footage of the young Dylan and shows his struggle with the image that the media had created for him. As with all great artists Dylan had to find a way to be true to his muse while being thrust into the media spotlight. Unlike many before him, Dylan seems to have been successful.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|In the past decade, we have been treated to many Michael Jackson collections,  HIStory (both as a 2 disc and single disc), Number Ones and the box set The Ultimate Collection.  By now, you're probably screaming \\"enough already!!\\". <br /> <br />Well, Sony finally has given Michael Jackson a Greatest Hits cd that is worthy of being the definitive MJ cd to own. <br /> <br />Unlike prior collections that purposely omit at least one hit from Off The Wall, Thriller and Bad (his trinity IMO) so people would still have to buy those, Sony finally realized the key to a great MJ cd is putting all the hits.  All 4 hits from OTW are included, all 7 from Thriller and Bad.   All but one of the Dangerous US singles (Jam) are here, and Jam is one of my least favorite Michael Jackson tracks, so I'm not mourning it's loss. <br /> <br />We also only get two latter tracks, You Are Not Alone and You Rock My World.  Scream would've been nice too but it's okay because all the other classics are here.  HIStory and Invincible were my least fave MJ recordings so one track each is fine by me.    <br /> <br />This is the only Michael Jackson cd anyone really needs, all but 2 Thriller tracks and all but 3 Bad tracks are represented.  No self-respecting 80's CD collection would be missing this.
0740748475|5.0|This beautifully bound collection is Watterson's thesis statement.  <br />Bill Watterson spent his career battling the tyrannical syndicates that rule over the cartoonist and limit his creativity. Watterson argued for more space on the funny pages, threatening to pull C & H from any paper that wouldn't give him the space his sprawling and beautiful genius required. At an address to Ohio State University he suggested that in the future, cartoonists might not be bound to newsprint, that they could produce their strips on high quality paper in the large-format, full-color glory that something as sublime as Calvin and Hobbes deserves. In his address he places his faith in the marketplace, trusting that those in the know would gladly pay more for a better product from a freer artist. Unfortunately it is too late for Bill, he is retired, but for the sake of future cartoonists, let us prove to the publishers, editors, and syndicates that cartoonists should have the all the dignity respect given a novelist. <br />Thank you
B0009A40ES|1.0|This is a prime example of why some books just shouldn't be given the movie treatment. It reduces a magical piece of descriptive writing to pure dribble. Don't get me wrong, the book is perverse, but the images the writer conjures up in the mind of the reader are far superior to this crap.

0679422714|1.0|I am a Chinese. <br /> <br />This is the worst \\"history\\" book I have ever read. Full of lies. It maybe to some people's taste. <br /> <br />Today, Mao can be discussed openly in China since CCP publically told the people the mistakes inthe cultrual revolution and great leap.  <br /> <br />The Great Leap happened between 1958-1961. The disasters happened plus the political mistakes, Many Chinese starved to death. The political errors did contributed to the deaths. But not too much. Without the leadship of Mao, and without the great improvement in the agriculture, more people should have died. How many died? Cannot be more than 10 million. <br /> <br />All Chinese know Mao's mistakes. But most of Chinese still respect him as the great leader of China. Under his leadership: <br /> <br />1. Chinsese did not worry about the invasion from other countries. Chinese had been struggling for this since opium war in 1840. <br />2. There was no warlords anymore <br />3. China was basically united except Hongkong, Macau and Taiwan. Hongkong and Macau's status were Mao's wise arrangement. They were the rade windows for the mainland when western countries had sanction against China. When China did not need those windows after the reform, China gov took them back right way. Taiwan issue was the result of civil war. Even there are a lot of troubles across the Taiwan strait, both side are still Chinese and bloodhood still exists. That's the fight between brothers. Not a big deal for China that has a long history. <br />4. China had free and functioning public education system. Every one had the equal rights for studying. Even the colledge students were paid for studying. In 1976, more than 70% of Chinese could read and write. There were only 20% before Mao's leadership. <br />5. Cheap but functioning public health system. No protitute, no sex-related disease, no big plague. Chinese life expectancy increased from 35 in 1949 to 65 in 1976. That's a hugh improvement. <br />6. A relatively modern agricultural system. More than half of the arable land could be watered. Fertilizer ussage per MU (A chinese unit, 666 square mters) increased from 0.2kg to 20kg. A 13 large fertilizer devices were ordered from wetern countries when China improved relationship with US. Those devices began production in aroun 1980 and pushed China's agriculture to a high level. Crops productionincreased by 2.5 times, cotton 4.6 times, meat 2.3 times. Hybrid rice was developed and extensively used in China.  <br />7. A relatively complete mordern industrial system. China could make trucks, tractors, planes, large ships, locomotives, TVs, computers, radios, cameras, power generators, ................anything you can name. Iron and steel production increased by 125 times, coal 15 times, electricity 47 times, petrolum 726 times, cement 71 times, ........ China achived this from nothing. This speed cannot be considered as slow. These truth cannot be denied. <br />8. A complete defense industry. China could build tanks, fighters, warships, missiles, n-bomb, h-bomb, SSN, ICBMs......... China achived this from nothing again. <br />9. Built similar railroad between 1949-1976 as what we did between 1978-today. China only had 22000km of railroad, but only 11000km was operational. Others was damaged or destroyed in the long time wars. But Chind had around 45000km of railroad in 1976. Today China had 70000km of modern railroad system. Considering CHina was much poor and much less developed. That speed was amazing. <br />10. The third front construction. That's a project for the possible war with USSR. It promoted the industry of western China to a high level. in 1976, there was no big development gap between eastern and western China. <br /> <br /> <br />When Deng Xiaoping took the power, he said a lot of \\"mistakes\\" Mao had made. All of us used to think that reform is always good in China. But unfortunately, That's not true. <br /> <br />The scientific research lagged more than the reform. before the reform, China was catching up. But the gap was widened between 1980-1995.  <br />The agricultrural reform? Proved to be a big failure. There is no or very little changes in recent 10 years. That's a big trouble in China now. It proves that Deng is shortsighted. Funny thing, there are still handful of relic socialism villadges in China, there are rich and more competetive in the market economy. <br />See the websites of these villadges: <br />[...] <br />[...] <br />[...] <br />Don't forget, they are socialism villadges. They are rich, maybe richer than most of Americans. In Huaxi villadge, every family has a house of more than 3000 sqaure feet. Plus each family has 40000US$ to 400000US$ cash savings. <br /> <br />Industrial refrom is a failure too. <br /> <br />The education reform is now being firecely critized in China <br />The public heath system is now being firecely critized in China. <br />The expanding corruptions.  <br /> <br />Chinese people and gov are rethinking about the reform. Some maybe changed back. For example the free education, subsidized public health system....  <br /> <br />Mao is getting more respect from ordinary Chinese people. His mistakes were totally forgiven by most of Chinese. <br /> <br />Of course, Hhe led revolution in China and definitely he has a lot of political enemies.  <br /> <br />This book is a junk and only the stupid will really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I think this deserved Best Picture and Best Director. The only thing I don't like about this movie is that it is TOO good. I mean it was good enough to dominate the Oscars and Golden Globes. This film tells the tale of the tragedy of the events of the sinking of Titanic. Very good directing and very good effects, this film should be considered watching.
0307276902|3.0|I bought this book because it sounded interesting, I had no idea it was an \\"Oprah's Book Club Pick.\\" I thought it was raw and real, but to be honest, I felt the first half of the book was boring. The majority of the time we heard more about his vomiting than anything else. However, mid way I found it to pick up and peak my interest. You do not feel sorry for this James Frey which is the way I think he wanted it. There wasn't a family trauma that caused him to be the addict he is, it is shows you that anyone, no matter what background they come from, can spiral into this hell.
0307276902|5.0|This book could work as a tool for kids considering drugs and alcohol as a life choice, it can scare you straight. The book was amazing, it's simple yet thoughful. Blessings to James Frey!!

0062502182|5.0|I first read this book in 1994.  I have since read it 10 other times and am about to read it another.  I find it a source of centering.  This book while simple to read, is so deep and soulful.  Read it looking for what is is teaching you. As with life...you can let it pass you by, and it can be simple and trivialistic.  Look deeper, it's not hard, there is a message there. The message is individual for what ever point in your life you are in.  As I mentioned I've read it 11 times and each time pulled something else from it.  Enjoy it, drink it, love it!

B0002SROT0|5.0|Smith's material that he was working on before his tragic death is some of the best, most emotional material that I have heard in a long while. If the Beatles were more periphery and more morose, the result would be something similar to what came from Smith's basement on the hill. The music is great, dark and mellow. If this CD needed to be described by a color, I would chose a dark velvety purple or a deep dark red. The music and lyrics are sad and heartbreaking, but not exactly depressing or pessimistic. It gives those of us going through struggles with relationships or other obstacles something to relate to. Every track is very strong and essential to the disc's effect. The lyrics are sad, but not whinny. Smith's words are very honest and the listener can hear the struggles with life going through his head. Every aspect of the album's production is very appropriate as an hommage to Smith's loss. The lo-fi sound quality gives it a very retrospective, empty sound that coincides well with hearing the voice of a very devastating loss in popular music. Looking through the CD liner notes also makes for a great tribute to Smith's life work. Pictures of him and copies of papers he'd written some lyrics on evoke a sense of tribute and retrospection that makes the album all the more powerful. What makes this disc great is that it isn't just someone else's product for profit, but it was a genuine eulogy for an important figure in independent music. The music itself is a beautiful place to get lost and the production clearly had the intent of being a fond farewell to a friend. Goodbye Elliott. Thanks for all that you have left us.
B00005JNJV|5.0|For once, the producers got it. They didn't want to screw up the franchise anymore and seem to have understood the way Batman was meant to be seen: Dark, gritty, angry, yet intelligent, sensitive, and even showing flaws in his first wake as the batman.<br /><br />Are you sick and tired of being pushed around by actors wearing plastic-rubber suits that make them look like a group of circus? Then come on in, this movie is for you. Here, we are *treated* and the word is light, with a Bruce Wayne that understood what most of us knew long ago: Batman is a symbol of fear, representing a man's eternal journey to rid a corrupted city's evil.<br /><br />The movie opens with a young Bruce Wayne playing in his parents' garden with Rachel Dawes. Inadvertently, young Bruce falls into an old hole. Meanwhile, Rachel went to seek Alfred (Michael Caine) and Thomas Wayne for help. Flash-forward almost 15 years later as Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) wakes up, bearded, dirty and in a cell. A large man picks a fight with him and quickly, the young billionnaire gains the advantage over many fighters. Shortly after, Bruce is sent to an isolated cell for protection. There, he meets with Henry Ducard (Liam Neeson) who offers a proposition he can't refuse. The next morning, set free, Bruce Wayne embarks on a journey that will transform him into the most feared creature of the night by all criminal. A fearless fighter who became his own demon by fighting it, the Batman. But every fight and victory has its price as Bruce Wayne will learn throughout the course of the movie.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan not only did an excellent job directing his actors (as always), but he managed to keep every aspect of the film as natural as possible, so it's no surprise when the movie ends that we feel like it might happen somewhere... anywhere, next door. His direction is precise and he knows exactly what every scene means to the characters involved. A++ for the director. A wise choice from Warner Brothers who definitely should hire his services for an inevitable sequel that should be as good as this movie.<br /><br />Christian Bale (Duh, the man was so born to play Batman), Liam Neeson (a nice addition to his impeccable acting skills), Morgan Freeman (the genius behind most of Batman's gadgets, nevertheless, an exquisite time with this character), Michael Caine (this man IS Alfred, no questions here), heck, even Katie Holmes is great, Where I thought she would play the Kim Basinger-ish heroine, she strikes to the heart as a woman whose entire life is the same battle as Batman (only, without a mask). Katie Holmes is definitely, after Michelle Pfeiffer, the series' best female addition ever, beating (I'm sorry people) Uma Thurman and Nicole Kidman. This ensemble shines everytime the spotlight is on them and every scene makes you want more of their characters. You almost want to spend some time in Gotham City.<br /><br />The design of the city, as the look and feel of the movie, is as natural and realistic as ever. A lot of work went into this project and it definitely shows as the alleys crowded with hanged clothes, close buildings and high-rise buildings give us the most beliveable Gotham City we've ever seen on screen. The locations serve the story and characters, never the opposite, which makes this movie one of the best superheroes movies ever seen.<br /><br />The special effects are impeccable as Batman is surrounded by digital bats, most of the city's skyscrapers are nowhere near real and the stunts are impressive. I was baffled, without a word when I saw all the details (I've seen it 5 times so far and I always see something new... always realistic though)<br /><br />Overall, finally, Batman Begins is not only a worthy addition to your DVD collection, it's a must. Warner Brothers went over-the-top with this edition (the deluxe edition). The bonus features are near perfection as we are brought in to discover the real struggle to make Batman work with Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer as they speak about the secret project that was Batman Begins (so secret they had to name it \\"Intimidation Game\\"... I'm not making that up people). From the special effects to the building of the batsuit, it's all in one of the most exciting DVDs I've seen in years. Truly a must buy and a must-see... now it's a must-own and frankly, you couldn't pick a better Batman title if you want something coming close to the original comic book material.Christopher Nolan and David S.

B000AL730O|5.0|Most everybody says this is Paul's return to his first two solo albums I really think it's a definate return to Flaming Pie.  <br />Flaming Pie was  and is one of his best, period.
B00004W52U|5.0|Operation Ivy is the best band of all time. Every single song on here is amazing. Every band we have today has originated from these guys. Give these songs a few listens. They will grow on you a lot. I don't have any favorites because all of these songs are great. Check them out now!
B00005Q4CS|4.0|I'm not sure why anyone would want to watch this movie more than once.  As great as it documents the hellish descent of four people into various drug addictions, it can't possibly be an enjoyable entertainment experience.  That said, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM stands along with DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES as a gripping film that bares all the pain and sadness of characters who fall victim to their vices.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful, especially the ladies.  Jennifer Connelly continues to rack up her impressive resume, and Ellen Burnstyn commits to film one of the bravest performances I've ever seen.<br /><br />After catching this film again on the Independent Film Channel just now, I've switched over to a news program where the talking heads are discussing legalizing drugs.  The smarter people know how deadly drugs can be, and the more cynical can shrug dope off as another method of natural selection, but the drug problem in this country--whether crack or pills or whatever--is a poison seeping into all of our lives.<br /><br />I know people who have died of drugs and, sadly, I know a few more who will.<br /><br />REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is the kind of drug movie people need to see.
B00003BDXG|5.0|I don't know about the rest of you guys out there, but if I had to die, I would want juliette lewis to rape me and then blow me away. That would be a perfect exclemation point to my pitiful little life! To all those jerks offs out there who gave this movie two stars or less I say, bah! Who the hell watches movies for insight into the human condition anyway? If I want to learn something about life I'll go read some of the leading intellectuals of today such as noam chomsky or albert camus, although they'd probably come to the same conclusion as Micky and Malore Knox anyway, though with a lot more useless jibber jabber. That human life is just a buch a crap in a bag waiting to be lit on some old guys door step. I watch movies for the same reasons I live life. Sex, violence, and drugs, and this movie delivers them in spades.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril has a very nice voice and ver catchy lyrics to go with that good voice. I like all the songs on this album so here is a rating from 1 to 5 for each song: <br /> <br />1. Losing Grip - 4/5 A good song but in my opinion played too much on the radio and got boring. Still like to listin to it every once in a while but not too often.  <br /> <br />2. Complicated- 3/5 an okay song, not my personal favorite, once again played too much on the radio. <br /> <br />3. Sk8er Boi- 2/5 This song is way too little kiddish and poppy for my taste, also played too much on the radio. <br /> <br />4. Im With You- 5/5 I really like this song, it has very nice lyrics and a heart filled melody. <br /> <br />5. Mobile - 4.5/5 Good song. My firend really liked it, i am not too crazy about it.  <br /> <br />6. Unwanted- 3/5 good song. <br /> <br />7. Tomorrow- 4/5 good song. <br /> <br />8. Anything but Ordinary- 7/5 This is by far my favorite song on this album, it has catchy beats and a good guitar and good vocals to match. <br /> <br />9. Things ill never say- 5/5 Very Catchy. <br /> <br />10. My World- 5/5 Very good song, actually talks about real life. WoW ! Thats alot to say with music now. <br /> <br />11. Nobodys fool - 4.9/5 Very nice song talks about never being anyones fool ( hence the name) <br /> <br />12. Too much to ask - 4/5 ok song. <br /> <br />13. Naked- 6/5 I like this song alot it has a nice tune to it. <br /> <br />As you can tell i like some of Avrils songs and i dont like some. Thats music deal with it. Overall a good album.
B000002U9W|5.0|Yes there is a recipe inside this album that concists of stuffing diferent animals in each other and cooking them in garlic and spices.Absolutely insane!?!?!?! I just wonder if anyone has ever gone out of their way to actually make Roger Waters famous recipe! <br />Roger Waters was out of his mind. I think he was groovin in that cave too long with the Several Species of Small Furry Animals(on the album Ummagumma)or something! <br />This is by far the most weird think Pink Floyd ever did. <br />But with or without the famous never before used recipe this is easily one of Pink Floyds best and the most overlooked albums. <br /> <br />The music is incredible and miles ahead of side 2 of Ummagumma which was more of an experiment for the progressive sound in the making. The progressive sound become a the part of Pink Floyd that would stay with them until The Wall and it all comes together perfect on this album. <br />Even though classical instuments are used on this album like a Moody Blues album this sounds 100% like Pink Floyd. <br />There is no Pink Floyd album anything like this one however which you can say about a few other Pink Floyd albums. <br />The music here is incredible and some of the best and most original of any Pink Floyd album.  <br /> <br />It is one of those albums that shows that a rock band can be every bit as good, creative, and intellegent as 18th century composers and just how good Pink Floyd really was. Nobody makes music near this good anymore. Not even close. You are constantly reminded of this while listening to this album. <br /> <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is AN AWSOME ALBUM. Only passed by In utero. With songs like Smells Like teen spirit, in bloom, and lithium how could an album go wrong. This album is well worth the buy. After you buy this you are going to be craving to hear more and are going to get your butt down to the CD store and buy In Utero.
B00000IQW3|5.0|The Last Starfighter is in my collection of DVD's along with \\"The Flight of the Navagator\\" and others.  It's a silly happy feeling movie that brings a small tear to my eye as this type of movie brings memories of my kid years.  \\"You can do or be anything you put your mind to\\".  The film makes me feel good.  My wife thinks it's funny that I like the movie but hey, I LIKE IT.  If you just want to \\"loose\\" reality for a short time and enjoy make-beleive, just buy the movie, put it in the player, and enjoy with some popcorn and a soda. 8)
0316168815|5.0|Sebold, Alice.  THE LOVELY BONES. New York: LITTLE, BROWN AND COMPANY.2002.328 <br />  <br /> <br />Lovely Bones is a book that makes the reader think \\"what if that was to happen to me?\\" \\"What if I were to be raped and killed right near my home? How long would it take my parents to find my dead body?\\"  This book is narrated by the main character Susie Salmon, who is already in heaven and is telling the story from a strange new place. Susie a fourteen- year- old girl who was raped and killed is in heaven looking down to see that the marriage of her parents is falling apart following her death. She's watching her sister struggling to stay strong and her little brother trying to understand what the word gone means.  While she's up in heaven she is able to see her loved ones who like her, have passed away. Susie is also able to see how much people really loved her. There are a lot of strange things that go on in the book that only by reading the book you will be able to understand them.  <br /> I really recommend this book to all readers who sometimes wonder how it is to look down from heaven and see how the family you love is falling apart or maybe it's closer to each other than ever. This is a book that when Susie feels happy you feel happy too. When Susie feels sad it makes you feel so sad and even cry. It's a book that's full of mixed emotions and tragedy. It's a book that as soon as you start reading the book you will not want to stop reading it. So go ahead and give THE LOVELY BONES a chance and prepare yourself to witness a life full of emotions and horrible tragedies. <br />
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Muse is one of the most spectacular bands I have ever heard, and this album takes the cake.  There are no fillers.  Each song carries its own weight and soars.  They take the energy of rock and march it forward with the enegry and passion of an orchestra, while at the same time bringing their sounds down to soft subtlties that gives their music such a wonderful range of sound and emotion.  Like them or not, they are immensly talented and original.  And as for me, this is one of the greatest albums I have ever owned.
B0006L16N8|1.0|It's incredibly dissapointing that young people these days consider this band to be the greatest on earth.  They couldn't be further from that title if they tried.  Parachutes was a solid effort, but ever since then, Coldplay have allowed themselves to start believing in their comparisons to U2.  X&Y is only further proof of that.  It's like they decided to combine U2's \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" with Radiohead's \\"The Bends.\\"  And they fail horribly in the process.  Really.  Chris Martin, you are not Bono.  Jon Buckland, you are not The Edge.  Please, get that notion out of your heads as quickly as you can and make something ORIGINAL.  White Shadows and Square One are such BLATANT U2 rip-offs, I'm surprised people aren't mentioning it more often.  Twisted Logic has Radiohead written all over it (I know that probably pains you, Thom - it pains me too). <br /> <br />If you're in the 13-14 age range and are experiencing the musical epiphany that usually comes at that phase in your life, here is an assortment of albums you can purchase that will actually have some impact on your life: <br /> <br />U2 - The Unforgettable Fire <br />U2 - Achtung Baby <br />U2 - The Joshua Tree <br />U2 - War <br />Radiohead - OK Computer <br />Radiohead - The Bends <br />Joy Division - Closer

0780624890|4.0|I am a huge movie fan, and this is a great movie. If you like Vampire and action movies, you should definitely watch Blade!
B000092ZYX|4.0|Like everything that Radiohead ever touched, this album is incredibly powerful.  Unfortunately, the extreme feeling that I personally get from it is negative.  There is something very dark and scary that infects this entire album.  This feeling didn't appear in Pablo Honey or the Bends, but made its first appearance on the song Paranoid Android on OK Computer.  It came back shortly for the track Fitter Happier, and gave way to the rocker Electioneering. <br /> <br />It seemed to disappear on Kid A, but is very obvious on Amnesiac, particularly the songs Knives Out and I Might be Wrong.  I read somewhere that Yorke described Kid A as \\"looking at a fire from a distance\\" while Amnesiac is \\"being inside the fire.\\"  I take this to mean that Amnesiac is more what Yorke was going for in recording the albums, and not surprisingly, Hail to the Thief is the full development of the direction of their progress. <br /> <br />Radiohead never did anything without at least a slight touch of melancholy, but at the same time, they had created nothing without at least a touch of hope.  This changed when Hail to the Theif was released.  Every other Radiohead album leaves you with at least a small implication that things will be OK.  When I listen to this album, I don't get that.  For some people this is great.  To me it feels dead.  It feels hopeless.  I get the same feeling from listening to this album that I get from listening to people talk when they are strung out on drugs.  It is completely sad.  All apparent happiness has a hidden stink to it, waiting to be exposed on the next chord. <br /> <br />But along with complete despair, something else appeared on this album that I had not heard from Radiohead before.  There is a formula that this album was made to.  Up until this album, there was a new element to each album.  There was a new and exciting component.  But Hail to the Thief seems made to a formula using the components of all the other albums.  It makes for a more diverse album than ever before, but at the same time there is almost nothing new to it. <br /> <br />So I rate this song at a 4, because ultimately there is nothing wrong with it other than the fact that I do not enjoy listening to it.  But if you really enjoy the songs Paranoid Android, Fitter Happier, Knives Out, and In Limbo, you will probably get a kick out of Hail to the Thief.
1932907009|5.0|Blake Snyder has written one of the most simple, straightforward, inspiring and entertaining screenwriting books in recent memory. Sure, there are other more 'literate' screenwriting books, those that are full of deep thoughts and compelling ideas, those that cause you to search your soul and summon your shadow to the surface! And most -- if not all -- of those authors have never sold a single script to Hollywood!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love to wax philosophic about the greater possibilities of screenwriting and filmmaking as much as the next arteest! But if you want to actually sell scripts in this town, so that you can have the cash and cache to write the Great American Screenplay...read, memorize, and apply the industry truths contained in this tome!<br /><br />You will not only learn how to save the cat, but you'll also save time, suffering, and very likely your career.
1559277254|2.0|I realize that the Stephanie Plum series is primarily written for women and I can appreciate that. Even though I am a guy I had really enjoyed the books until this one. First of all, I grew very tired of all the misadventures. I know that is the charm of her character but I think she averaged 3 strange encounters a day. It just wasn't very realistic. Also, the ending was terrible. If Ranger was going to take care of her business anyway, why did he let her waste all that time? Lastly, is there going to be a point when Stephanie actually becomes semi-independent and competent. I am starting to lose the love for Ms. Plum.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This film is definitely one of the best children's movies of all time.<br /><br />The story is entertaining, heart-warming, sinister and funny all at the same time (only the mind of Roald Dahl could write a book that encompasses those four characteristics into one story).<br /><br />The acting is phenomenal. Danny Devito may not look like the father described in the book, but the attitude hits the nail on the head. He is rude, pig-headed, and brilliant to watch. Mara Wilson is a brilliant portrayal of the magickal bookworm, and is very convincing for a young actress. Pam Ferris is the most amazing choice to play the role of Miss Trunchbull, as she is the spitting image of the character that appears in the minds eye whilst reading, and in the Quentin Blake illustrations, plus she is suitably over-powering and cruel. And Embeth Davidzt is a breath of fresh air as the beautiful, lovely Miss Honey.<br /><br />The parts of the movie that are not in the book are well thought out and really exciting to watch, especially in the scene where Matilda and Miss Honey have snuck into the Trunchbull's house, and are trying desperately to escape. I can actually feel myself gritting my teeth as I watch it.<br /><br />This movie is fantastic to watch, and I have never got tired of it.
B00005MP58|4.0|I've owned this DVD set for four years, and I have to say that its the gift that keeps on giving.  I watch this movie often. Its a great Mother-Daughter bonding tool.  This A&E production is the best version of the Jane Austen classic.  You'll giggle at the ridiculous Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins. You'll snarl at the high and mightly Bingley sisters.  You'll admire and envy Lizzy.  You'll love Mr. Darcy.  Yes, the color is off...and let's hope a brighter edition becomes available, but for now I'm enjoying what I have.  Capital, Capital!
B00000J7RZ|3.0|The opening Top 5 hit \\"If You Had My Love\\" is pure pop perfection.  While Lopez may not have the best voice, it works well with the material she is given (Up til the \\"I'm Real (Remix).\\"  The album has a Latin style to it and contains a mediocore mix of forgettable ballads and so-so upbeat tracks.  \\"Feelin So Good\\" sounds like a mess (which is produced and features her ex-boo Puff Daddy/P Diddy/Diddy) as does the Gloria Estefan-written \\"Let's Get Loud.\\"  There are highlights, however...such as the hit single \\"Waiting for Tonight\\" (Produced by the Metro team of Cher's \\"beleive\\" fame) and the bouncy \\"Open Off My Love.\\"  Although I enjoy the vocals from her current husband Marc Anthony, No Me Ames is pretty forgettable.  \\"Too Late\\" sounds almost identical to Brandy's \\"Learn The Hard Way.\\"  My favorite songs from the album are \\"If You Had My Love\\", \\"It's Not That Serious\\", \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" and \\"Should've Never.\\"  The other songs are somewhat listenable but it's up to the buyer if you think it's worth the money. Personally I don't.  \\"J Lo\\" is much better album in terms of quality.
0307276902|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read since I was a child.  I loved Nancy Drew and Harby boy books because I couldn't put them down. I wanted to read just one more chapter. I felt the same about this book. I felt each time I read the book that I was crawling into James body and living the unfolding story with him. He writes his thoughts and that is what makes the story so interesting.  This is a book that is a must have and a must read especially for this generation..a story that too many have lived.
B000002J2B|5.0|this is by far the best post-gabriel effort by the band.    the expected hesitance and lack of direction after the loss of gabriel displayed in 'the trick of the tail' is overcome and the band emerges with greater confidence and clarity of purpose in this album.    great melodies, inspired vocals by phil collins, organ wizardy by tony banks, fretboard magic by steve hackett, the probing bass of mike rutherford and delicate drumming by phil collins marks this album painted on the images of classic england. this is not the prog rock of the gabriel era genesis but a more straight forward song by song approach (though some of the songs are quite lengthy).    eleventh earl of mar, one for the vine, your own special way, all in a mouse's night and blood on the rooftops are all stand out tracks (especially the last two) built on great melodies and instrumental virtuosity. organ melody and gunpowder drumming fires up the instrumental 'wot gorilla' and mellotron atmospherics dominate the other two instrumentals towards the end of the album. The album closes with the tender and reflective afterglow.    great music from a great band which clearly enjoyed doing it. if you like this album also check out \\"and then there were three ...\\".
B00004STUL|3.0|The movie is great, no question, but the whole reason for purchasing the DVD is for the extras.  I, for one, expect to seee deleted scenes, bloopers, the making of the movie, cast & cre interviews, etc...The DVD would have been much more worthy of the purchase had these elements been incorporated. Because the movie is good, I give it 3 stars.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Best concert, best music I have ever seen. Truly spectacular. The Eagles are \\"spot on\\" to quote Tim Schmit. What really blows me away is they were this good since the 70's. I have all the old albums, and they were beautiful even then. They have always been this talented! Glen Frey made the comment \\"It's not an accident the vocals sound good\\" and I though that was so cool. They work hard at it and know it. Not like the ^%$# today, where bands brag about how wasted they were, etc. These are real professionals with God given talent and it shows. And they are rightly proud of that. I hope we are blessed with many more years of Eagles farewell Tours!!!!
B00005JKHN|5.0|When I was little, this was the movie that I rented every single time we rented movies because it made me happy, it made me sad, and it scared the crap out of me when the dragon came so much that I had to hide behind the couch.  This movie is my favorite disney film.  Both my sisters called me gay when the saw me come home with this movie when it was re-released on video.  I watched that tape so much that I wore it out and I had to throw it away.  I was so sad.  When I saw the dvd in wal-mart one day I picked it up right away and payed for it. The picture was even better than I could emagine, I saw things I never did before thanks to the widescreen formate, and the sound quality was awsome.  I am now 17 years old and its still in my dvd player at least twice a week.  When I have kids, I'm going to show this movie to them and all the rest of the old disney movies and I'm sure that their emagination will take them into the movie just as mine did, and that will be a good thing.
0517092948|5.0|In one sense  I think almost every person feels a special pleasure in having a complete edition of the world's greatest writer. The special experience of knowing that one can turn whenever one wants to such great works of literature, and explore them again is a very real one.<br /><br />However my long experience with reading has taught me that reading the plays in smaller single - volume more heavily annotated works gives more.<br /><br />I notice for instance that my own ' complete edition' goes largely unread, and that when I need to read Shakespeare I always go to the single- volume works.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|There are lots of WW II documentaries - this is certainly the best one to own.  It covers ALL aspects of the war in fine detail with analysis, not just \\"shoot 'em up videos.\\"  As it was made in the early '70s by the BBC, it focuses slightly more on the UK, its operations and the Western front.  Still, it also gives great overviews and explanations of the Pacific war and the Russian front.   <br /> <br />This is an astounding value, especially including all the extras.  It has high quality interviews, extremely informative narratives, fascinating war footage and is wonderfully enjoyable to view.  The Stephen Ambrose (Band of Brothers) interview is an insightful extra.  Whether you're an academic, military history buff, or just want to expand your knowlege of 20th century events, this is WW II DVD set to have.

B000AYQJ3I|5.0|In writing this review I must complement the Harrison family and the executors of his estate for the marvellous job they have done in preserving and not diminishing George's memory. On the eve of the anniversary of his passing we have a quality product which in keeping with the man and his memory, enables us to help those unfortunate souls in the third world while enjoying this entertainment.<br /><br />\\"My friend came to me, sadness in his eyes, told me that he needed help, before his country died\\". How could someone refuse such a request. This concert reissue comes only days after a major earthquake has brought untold devastation and misery to millions in Southern Asia to whom this concert was first dedicated almost 35 years ago. It is fitting that this coincident release will help some of those affected.<br /><br />Much has already been said about the concert footage which is reproduced on the first disc of the set although much cleaned up and with better quality sound. It is easy to forget what a task Harrison had in assembling such a troupe of musicians at the time. The difficult separation and divorce of the Beatles added to his own inexperience being the leader and not just the member of a band, Clapton with his ongoing substance abuse problems which had driven him to being a recluse and the shyness of Bob Dylan in front of such a crowd, this in the days before arena rock became the norm rather than the exception. Despite all of this the musicians played well together although the wall of sound approach sounds a little over the top when one compares to the slimdown reunion performance of Cream recently. There is a touch of the democratic approach with most of the artists with the exception of Clapton contributing at least one song to the proceedings.<br /><br />History cannot show how significant this concert was in the sense that younger viewers will not understand what the big deal was and nor will they be enlightened by this set. Save to say that without the huge efforts of George Harrison, before, during but very mainly after this concert, there would not have been any of the super benefit concerts that we see today. Perhaps one daring film-maker may try to tell the tale of all of the hoops Harrison had to go through to finally get all of the total monies raised to actually go to where it was needed and the years he spent in doing it.<br /><br />The real gem of this set is the second disc which catalogues the making of the concert. Harrison is heard in voiceovers culled from interviews at regular stages. He emerges as the unassuming leader who calls upon a few palls but does not cut them any breaks if they fall down or give up on them. It includes some footage of some of the remaining participants as well as a brief comment from Kolfi Annan about the importance of this musical event bringing the world's attention to this serious problem in Bangladesh. There are three snippets too which will delight Harrison and Dylan fans the best of which is the duet between the two of \\"If Not for You\\" with the contrasting voices and approaches of the two men making for a superb historical and musical gem.<br /><br />There are many worthy causes out there right now even some in our own backyard worthy of your money and attention. As we approach the season of goodwill this is one excellent way to enjoy great music from the man who brought some light to the world and to help others in the process.<br /><br />This is one DVD I can heartily recommend.thout the huge efforts of George Harrison, before, during but very mainly after this concert, there would not have been any of the super benefit concerts that we see today.

B00005R8FI|5.0|When I bought this CD, I figured on it being a fantastic album from the get go. When I received it and loaded it into my cd player, I had thought that I had bought a pig in the poke. Boy was I wrong.  <br /> <br />The CD had only one song that I had ever heard was \\"Room to Move\\" and I thought that this was the only decent song on it. After listening to it all the way through the first time, I picked out a few more tracks that had some possibilities. Now that I have run it through several more times through headsets this time, I can see where it really is a fine album.  <br /> <br />After listening to it a few times, I realized that I had bought one of the best live blues albums ever recorded. This CD is well worth the price and I hope that everyone will give this one more than a few listens to realize this.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Depeche Mode have always managed to craft albums that satisfied hard core fans but rarely have they created albums that seemed to resonate with the larger public.  Some Great Reward, Music For The Masses and Violater achieved this while Exciter and Ultra were beloved by fans only for the most part.  I don't dislike those albums as some do, I just felt that the best tracks on both would have made a great album combined.  They were experimenting and there is nothing wrong with that.  Many bands with a 25 year history have done the same with varying degrees of success.<br /><br />That being said, Playing the Angel just may be the best album of the last 10 years by DM.  Precious is a great lead off single and classic DM but when I bought the album it took me a bit of time to wrap myself around it fully.  I was forcing my own expectations on it without giving the disc a full listen, prejudices aside.  As I listened to it more I eventually found myself doing the ole' \\"Oh yeah, I love this song\\" thing with just about every track on it.  It was definitely a slow burner for me that transformed into a four alarm blaze rather quickly.  In fact, being a huge Brian Eno fan, I will go out on a limb and say that this is the type of material I would expect from him than DM.  I mean that not as a slight on Eno, but more a compliment to DM.  Martin and Co. have finally put everything into one package, all their influences and the changes they have gone through over the years are present here.<br /><br />Some may want a little more Music For The Masses or Violator on this release but for those who felt Black Celebration was their true masterpiece then this album will surely please.  It's not Black Celebration II by any means, it just roots itself in that vein.  Give the album a few dedicated listens before passing judgement and I highly recommend spinning it on headphones a few times to fully engross yourself in what they have accomplished with this release.  A healthy shout out to Dave as well for contributing great songs that don't end up being filler as I feared they might.<br /><br />Stand Out Tracks:<br /><br />Suffer Well<br />Precious<br />Nothing's Impossible<br />Lilianontributing great songs that don't end up being filler as I feared they might.

1400032717|5.0|As both an author and father of a child with Asperger's, I was drawn to this book to see if Haddon could truly capture the unique brilliance and absent social skills of an autistic boy. Not only does he succeed at the task, he adds a healthy dash of humor while avoiding the easy trap of pathos a lesser author might have fallen into. The book is stunning in its accuracy of how those with autism view the world and- just as important- how the world views them. It is this last viewpoint that elevates the book to more than just clever, because we see through Christopher's literal-minded eyes the duplicity of the \\"normal\\" world, the world that all assume must be superior. In a way, Haddon's book reminds me of that great short story \\"Gimpel the Fool\\" by Isaac Bashevis Singer, a story of a simple, honest man who believes all the lies he's told. In the end, it's not those who tried to trick him, but Gimpel himself who's revealed to be the wisest one for remaining firm in his belief that goodness will prevail. So too does Christopher prevail, his detective work unveiling the truth and overcoming all the futile attempts to thwart or dismiss his meticulous investigation.<br /><br />I don't know if I'll ever write a book with an autistic character, but thanks to Mr. Haddon, I feel like it's already been done for me.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.<br /><br />-Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einstein
B000002GQG|5.0|In Search of the Lost Chord is not a music album composed of songs.  It is a complete, amazingly beautiful spiritual experience.  To take the journey, prepare a quiet peaceful room with headphones or really good speakers, candles or other aids to meditation.  You need to really hear everything and to let your emotions flow with the songs.  The layers, the harmony and the rhythms can aid you to lose your-Self completely.  I cherish this album so much that I seldom listen to it, for fear of losing its impact through overexposure.  I have hundreds of music albums from the 60s to the present.  This one stands alone.

B0001MDP3G|4.0|Anthony Minghella directs this tale based on the best-selling book about wounded Civil War soldier Inman (Jude Law) making the long, treacherous journey to his home in Cold Mountain, N.C. Along the way, he thinks of his love, Ada (Nicole Kidman), who has fought for sanity and her father's farm's survival while Inman has been gone, even with a brave young drifter named Ruby (Renee Zellweger, in an Oscar-winning performance) there to lend a hand.
B000AP04MO|5.0|I've loved this film since its release in 1967, when I was a teenager.  20th Century Fox distributed TWO FOR THE ROAD but gave all the publicity that year to DR. DOOLITTLE. Unfortunate choice. Each time you view it, you notice different things, depending on where you are in your own life. The film is  bittersweet - and acerbically written by Frederick Raphael. The script is smart, funny, bitter, sad, ironic, cynical, and yes, romantic.   We witness a couple who fall in love, and see their relationship go through many phases over the years, in flashback, and in the present - of 1966.    Director Stanley Donen did a terrific commentary on the laserdisc release in the early 90's, and that's the one being used on the dvd.  It's fascinating.  Donen said of all the films he's made, this one seemed to have touched people the most.  Couples got married because of it, stayed together because of it, etc. It's a film that really has changed people's lives! Every word, every edit, every detail was carefully chosen by Donen (and Raphael in the screenplay).   Also important to note: Henry Mancini did the beautiful, haunting score, and according to his autobiography   (\\"Did They Mention the Music?\\"), this was his own personal favorite!   It was also the first time Miss Hepburn did NOT have her clothes especially designed for her by Givenchy - they were \\"off the rack\\". Director Donen believes this might be Miss Hepburn's best performance.  He had previously worked with her on CHARADE and FUNNY FACE.   The video release of this film was awful, primarily because it was in the pan and scan mode. The viewer missed half of what was originally intended to be on screen. Colors were faded, print was only fair, etc. (Big thumbs down for pan and scan on ANY release!)   The video release was pretty much a throwaway. (And that's exactly what I did with my cassette)  The dvd version has had significant restoration and the print is terrific.   So now, TWO FOR THE ROAD is finally being released on dvd -  new generations will see it the way it the way it was meant to be seen.

B000B5IPLK|4.0|Before I begin my review of Alicia's Unplugged album, let me state that in listening to music, I do not look for perfection, but rather, emotion. It is safe to say that Alicia's vocals are not of the utmost perfection on this album. It is obvious that her voice is a bit strained and she does fall flat on a couple of incidences. However, Alicia never fails to deliver raw emotion, which is always absolutely beautiful. Her versions of \\"Diary\\" and \\"Fallin\\" deliver the most emotion in my opinion and are the true gems on the album. On \\"Fallin\\" Alicia sounds as if she is simply pouring her heart out. I even welcome her hoarsness, especially evident on this track. This album can be played from start to finish without skipping a single track, and is worth buying if only for the new versions of \\"Diary\\" and Fallin.\\"
0876855575|4.0|For years I sold Bukowski's poetry to sad-looking men and the occasional punk-looking (very young) woman. This was in the 1980s and early 1990s. I never took the stuff seriously. Poetry about hangovers and turds? Give me a break. <br /> <br />But when I was introduced to Russell David Harper's manuscript of BALD -- his own ficitional memoir -- and Miha Mazzini's CARTIER PROJECT, I was forced to dig deeper into this phenomenon. (CARTIER is an eastern European Bukowski, and BALD is an intelligent memoir of hangovers.) <br /> <br />HAM ON RYE was my first real Bukowski venture, and I devoured it. It's a sad and moving work. There's not a single metaphor in it; it's to-the-gut writing straight from the heart. I bought my copy dog-eared and coffee-stained in a sidewalk sale in San Francisco, and I'm not letting it go. However, I'm now afraid of digging deeper into Bukowski out of fear of being disappointed. HAM ON RYE has set my expectations unreasonably high.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|I picked this up at my favorite retailer, and immediately popped it in the car's CD player.  Ah, the familiar electro-vibes I'm so used to hearing from this band.  OK, decent opening tunes.   <br /> <br />I previewed them all searching for the bounce, the beat, the \\"make-me-get-outta-the-car-and-dance\\" sound.  Nothing, nowhere to be found.  This disc reminds of early DM in style, but even then there were a couple of bouncy, fun tunes.   <br /> <br />Another comparison I thought was of David's and Martin's attempts at \\"solo-hood\\".  Both of those CDs weren't up quite what DM has done in the past. <br />
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|No movie I have seen in 20 years more reminds me of Biblical epics from the 1950s -- such as \\"The 10 Commandments\\", \\"The Robe\\" and \\"Samson and Delilah\\" -- than this two hour and 30 minute epic. Every delicious frame of this film builds on the concept of Homer's \\"Iliad\\" and the Trojan wars, with people like Helen of Troy and Agamemnon described before you in ways you never understood when you learned Greek mythology in 9th grade.<br /><br />And let's face it -- the whole goings on here are myth. It's not like the moviemakes took the Magna Carta and recast it as the Communist Manifesto! This is a big budget Hollywood extravaganza about a bunch of stuff that never really happened. So what does it matter if it is not 100 percent \\"authentic\\"?<br /><br />I am frankly disquieted that this extraordinary film -- whose cinamatic canvass is a mile wide and two inches deep -- did not receive some form of Oscar nomination for its look, feel and development. Also, this was the film time I really understood the appeal of its star, Brad Pitt. Yes, I know he's a pretty boy with a great smile and nice body. But in this movie he appealed to men, too, maybe for the first time in his career.<br /><br />So I have to give this extraordinarily entertaining wide screen epic a top ranking for its look, development, story development and, yes, acting. I see 100 movies a month and this is the best of the big budget films I've seen in many months, perhaps since \\"The Pianist\\". It's a great movie seen once, twice or 20 times.
074322454X|4.0|As I did with his D-Day book, I purchased Stephen Ambrose's \\"Band of Brothers\\" after watching the film (in this case the HBO mini series) on which it was based. And like the D-Day book I thoroughly enjoyed this one for many of the same reasons.  <br /> <br />Ambrose is a gifted narrator who recounts historical events in the same colorful and compelling manner as Barbara Tuckman. He relies heavily on primary source material and often quotes from it verbatim, which gives readers immediate access to the people and events of which he writes. <br /> <br />One thing I would have loved to see in this book would be more information from the German point of view. For example, the Colonel in charge of the 88 mm guns that Easy Company took out on D-Day was alive at the time of Ambrose's writing. It would have been great to have gotten a much more detailed sense of what it was like for him and his men to be on the receiving end of Easy's fire power. By the way, I'm not requesting this in order to be more fair or balanced or anything like that. It's just that the story tends to be more complete and compelling when we get a feel for the other side. This is something Neal Sheehan accomplished beautifully in \\"A Bright and Shining Lie\\" when he wrote of military events in Vietnam from the American and North Vietnamese point of view. <br /> <br />My one gripe about this book is Ambrose's personal judgments, which are intrusive, historically dubious and unnecessary since the story is compelling enough without them. For example, in summarizing Easy Company's victory in the Battle of the Bulge, Ambrose notes that the Germans and the Americans threw their best soldiers at each other and despite numerical inferiority, the Americans won. Ambrose concludes (with one of his favorite themes) that this was because the Americans were citizen soldiers of a democracy while the Germans were fighting for a totalitarian government.  <br /> <br />That sounds pretty compelling and it may or may not betrue, but where is the data to back it up? Because of victory in one battle or one war, we know that citizen soldiers in a democracy fight better than soldiers in a dictatorship? Then how is it that America's citizen soldiers in Vietnam lost to the numerically inferior North Vietnamese army, which fought on behalf of a totalitarian government?  <br /> <br />Ambrose knows better than to advance such arguments. The Battle of the Bulge resulted from a desperate German counter attack that did much damage and ultimately failed. Even if it had succeeded, the allies would still have won the war.  <br /> <br />This gripe aside, I loved the book and could not put it down. <br />
0670033375|5.0|In his 1997 Pulitzer Prize winning book \\"Guns,Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies,\\" Jared Diamond argued that geography and environmental richness rather than culture or human endeavor were primarily responsible for the present distribution of the wealth and poverty among nations.  In his reliance on geographical determinism, crudely speaking, he won both praise and criticism.  Praise because he showed that one society is not more gifted than another, it's just that some have been dealt a better hand in terms of environmental richness. Critics, on the other hand, claim he was pandering to political correctness insofar as he discounts culture or intelligence as reasons for the West's dominance.<br /><br />In his new book \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose the Fail or Succeed,\\" Diamond establishes the importance of conscious human actions.  The subtitles of the two books are telling: the first talks about fate and the second about human choice.  \\"Collapse\\" can be read as a sequel to \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\"  And it can stand alone as well.  Together these books form a monumental 1,000 page masterpiece.  They are both incredibly well-researched and to my knowledge very original.  Diamond is a very inspiring and compelling writer, the case studies that he's done are absolutely fascinating.  Diamond traces environmental catastrophes from the prehistoric Polynesian culture of the Easter Islands to the Native American cultures of the Mayans and the Anasazi to the Vikings in Greenland and then to the modern world of Hispanola, Australia, and China.<br /><br />The case history of the Viking settlements in Greenland - which was one of the prime examples of past societies that failed - shows how an advanced, food-producing European society established itself in a very forbidding continent and survived from many centuries (450 years) by raising cattle and growing crops.  However, with the advance of a colder climate they could no longer survive as agriculturalists, and they refused to change to hunting and fishing as the neighboring Inuits.  They disdained the Inuits and considered their methods inferior.  The Viking decision to stick to farming cost them their lives, and the Inuits survive to this day.<br /><br />From his numerous case studies, Diamond distills five factors that determine whether societies succeed or fail: 1) climate change, 2) loss of trading partners, 3) hostile neighbors, 4) environmental degradation, and 5) the lack of collective will to respond to environmental problems.  All of these factors were at work in the Viking's demise in Greenland.  The Vikings lacked the collective will to change their ways, and it proved to be suicidal.<br /><br />Of all the modern societies that Diamond examines, China is the most critical.  As China progresses towards its goal of becoming a first-world economy and a great power, its per-capita consumption rates would double; this would, needless to say, severly impact the environment.  It is doubtful, according to Diamond, that this increase is sustainable.  China's problem, of course, would become the world's problem.<br /><br />Yet Diamond calls himself cautiously optimistic.  Present trends do not necessarily imply global catastrophe.  It is true that technology can accelerate environmental degradation, it is also true that technology can avert ecological suicide.  When one looks at densely populated cities such as Tokyo or London, one can be cautiously optimistic that human beings can solve their problems collectively.<br /><br />Inspite of the title of this book, it is not a prophecy of doom, it is a warning.  Even if all these case studies do not yield a single unifying theory, the point is that societies made the choices that determined their success or failure.  What we learn from this work is that we can avoid some of the mistakes that societies have made in the past and we can better prepare ourselves for the catastrophes that we will confront in the future.o change to hunting and fishing as the neighboring Inuits.

B000ANVQ0K|1.0|This rating is exclusively for the Mexican Region 4 Edition... Not the movie, nor the extras... Hang on with me and you'll know the reason why I give it such a low rating.  <br /> <br />I was excited to know that the 4 disc edition was only going to be available for certain markets (Including Mexico) but my dissappointment lies in the fact that the Mexican Edition does not have a DTS Audio Track. So, I guess I'll just have to buy it again through Amazon or in my next vacation trip to the U.S. I'm a rabid fan of DTS Sound, so it was sort of a let down to know of the lack of it when it is even announced on the box. Don't get fooled as I was. I'm sort of a completist, so I'll surely be getting the U.S. 3 disc edition just for the sake of having the chance of experiencing this movie with the best audio format ever available: DTS! <br /> <br />Enrique Aguilar.
B0009JAENU|5.0|At last, a chance to hear Natalie Zhu. Being a Hilary Hahn fan for a few years now, I have read about Ms. Zhu and heard her in interviews, snippets, etc. but have no other recording of her playing. (If anyone knows of her recordings or has recommendations, please let me know) <br /> <br />From the moment the CD starts it's a magical meld of musicianship. The piano and violin immediately compliment each other and you know there's nothing else that will be needed or wanted for the entire disc.  <br /> <br />And that's just the warm up. For some reason, Track 2 especially hits home with me. It's simply beautiful. The rest of the disc is more of the same wonderful music and performance. <br /> <br />I'm not a big Mozart fan but will be listening to these sonatas over and over. You can listen to this disc anyway you wish. Intently, in the background, in the car. It fits perfectly anywhere.  <br /> <br />Hmmm, maybe if I put an addition on the house Hilary and Natalie can just stay there and play. I'll feed them...
B000B5XOY8|4.0|Well, to start off I was a kid when this Burton vision of Gotham came out, and to me it still stands the test of time. The effects are great, and still very effective. The acting and chemistry between Michael and Jack is great, and they both chew up the scenes when it is just them with the other actors. Then there is Burton himself, coming off Beetlejuice, he rightfully deserves the credit for ushering in the \\"OK\\" factor for comics to be gritty for their film translations (If Miller can re-invent the dark knight for comics then Batman should be dark in the films). For kids, this is pretty good for entertaining, I know I was just blown away in the movie theatre.<br /><br />The probelms (and I noticed these when I was a kid)are the LARGE plot holes, lack of plot(basically it is just skits of Batman and Joker)and the obivious attempt to tighten things up by having Jack Naiper kill Bruce's family, which leads to Bruce becomign Batman. The biggest one, that nobody believes me on, but after Batman gets Vicki out of the museum, the Joker asks: \\"Where does he get all those wonderful toys?\\", then after the Batmoblie is shown it cuts back to Joker saying: \\"Well, just don't stand there... go ask the man!\\". That cutback is omitted and has been since the original theatre cut. Also the whole Batman killing people thing just doesn't work for me. As I kid I read Batman. I grew up knowing the Bat does not kill, and what happens? Joker dies by Batman's hands! To that fact Penguin and Two Face do too, WHAT!<br /><br />All in all, this Batman is good. If you REALLY want to see Batman then get Nolan's Batman Begins. Not only is it more influenced by Miller's Year One and related materials; it is everything that Batman should be... and yes Nolan gets it right, the Bat does not kill!<br /><br />By the way don't believe the guy below saying Batman Begins stinks, there is not one example to back up his claim in any way, shape, or form (must not have \\"gotten\\" Memento or Insomina... so he's bitter).

Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret is the classic synth pop/new wave album Tainted Love comes off of but the album contains such cult hits as Sex Dwarf (my favorite as I heard it thousands of times on LIVE 105 in San Francisco in the 80's and into the 90's), Seedy Films which was recently remade by the DMX Krew (they did a really upbeat version while the whole Electroclash sound was happening), Bedsitter and Say Hello Wave Goodbye. Of course this album also contains the extended version of Tainted Love with Where Did Our Love Go. An excellent version worth listening to over and over again. I think this album is underrated given the fact that Tainted Love has been such a HUGE hit the rest of the tracks on here should be given the same praise as Tainted Love has. Excellent release and worth owning and adding to any 80's collection. <br /> <br />SJ <br />[...]

074325144X|5.0|As the years go by I've found it harder and harder for me to motivate myself to run.  Dreyer's book openned my eyes and helped me improve my body mechanics in running so that I'm now able to run more efficiently with less trauma to the knees and back than before.  Also, running is less stressful to me now (both emotionally and physically. In fact, running is more enjoyable!<br /><br />I'm in the military, and I have to run twice a year for the APFT (Physical Fitness Test).  One of the events is the 2-mile run, and by using Dreyer's techniques just this past couple of weeks, I was not only able to meet Army Fitness standards easily, but I was able to shave more than a minute from my previous finishing time!  Furthermore, I was less discombobulated after the run than I usually am after the timed 2-mile run, and more importantly, I was less achey and sore afterwards.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of soldiers' knees get burned out from the 2-mile event, and I would highly recommend Dreyer's strategies to them.  Also, I would highly recommend it to those who are struggling to meet the US Army 2-mile standards but just can't quite make it (I sympathize a lot with them).<br /><br />Now, if only Dreyer would write a book about Chi Push-ups and Chi Sit-ups . . . . .

B00005JLKN|3.0|*** 1/2    Red Dragon.    I like this movie. It wasn't the best of the series, but I did like it. I also liked the book. Manhunter was a different matter.    First, this knawing of teeth in comparisons of the films. As I said on my review of Manhunter. Red Dragon is a superior adaptation of the book. While in Red Dragon, we don't see the complete story of Dollarhyde. We get an abbreviated version with his diary and the voice of his grandmother abusing him. Manhunter makes no effort to portray Dollarhyde other than a psycho freak who likes Iron Butterfly. There are also other knocks against Manhunter I've written about that you'll have to seek out my review to learn.    What I find amusing is the snob gallery who lauds Micheal Mann's Manhunter for the style. These promoters seem to completely miss the substance angle. I see critiques and praise of Mann as a director but hardly any arguing superior storyline. Its very interesting. They don't argue it, because they can't. Manhunter may be visual and stylistic fluff, but it plays fast and loose with the book for its own ends. For that along with Don Johnson's pink sport jacket soundtrack ruin it.    Now, I've had my two cents with Manhunter. Time to speak of Red Dragon. Its not perfect either. It is, however pretty good. The added opening sequence was completely brillant. It brought you into the film immediately. It provided critical backstory on Graham and Lecter. It also selflessly lets the story talk instead of some director getting an ego trip. Stories are what make films folks - not directors. Brett Ratner for all the scorn heaped on him by the Mann fanboys does a good job getting out of the way and letting the story be told. He deserves credit for knowing what makes a good film.    I have some nit picks with Red Dragon regarding omissions from the book. I'd like to have seen the depth of Molly going to Oregon with Josh(Willy as in the book) or the hospital sequence with Lounds telling Graham he set him up to die.Those would've given additional context. Additional gripes are - Graham's struggle isn't as paramount (which it should have been - Manhunter did that well) and I'd like to have seen Dollarhyde's childhood edited in - for pacing it would've slowed things down - but it would've been nice. Overall though, Red Dragon holds the story.    Visually, I prefer Red Dragon. Lecter's cell in Manhunter is spartan and plain. The Silence of the Lamb's Lecter cell (which is used here) is rich, dark and adds to the character.    Red Dragon's ending holds well too. Sure it isn't 100% like the book but it stays much truer than Manhunter. Manhunter totally copped out. Only differences in Red Dragon are the confrontation in the house and afterwards.... Graham is there in the movie, instead of being injured on the beach like the book. Molly is the one who kills Dollarhyde in the house. Graham also reads Lecter's note from a hospital bed instead of a yacht.  Some changes yes, but again much closer to the book than Manhunter.    A reviewer pointed out differences in age appearance versus Silence of the Lambs. While true, I was able to look past it and focus on the story. It wasn't glaring.    Bottom line here - In all the posturing by the Manhunter crowd they cannot say Manhunter is a superior adaptation. It is not. Red Dragon is much less stylistic, lets the story talk and gives you a better faith effort in its adaptation.    By the way, no way in hell Cox was better as Lecter. The high society european artisan Harris' writes about I don't think Cox could've played it. Cox's lecter was much more working class IMHO.

B000AL730O|5.0|Nothing can stop this guy.  As far as I can see from the negative reviews, those people must want Paul to play music he's already played.  This album is different.  Play it a couple times.  I personally don't need to hear him put out a new album with a 'She loves you', 'Paperback Writer', or 'Silly Love Songs'.  Not that those songs are bad, it's just that he's already been there and done that.  This stuff on this album is really good.  This is a great CD.  I can't stop playing it.  I'd love to see him play Cincinnati here live.  I'd be there.  I saw him in '93 in St. Louis and he was brilliant.  This new band he has is so awesome....  KEEP going Paul!!  I'm a lifelong fan (my first 45 record ever was Band On the Run)!!

Every song on this cd is different, and has a unique flavor added to it. They just keep shocking thier fans with music that is differnt everytime. this si one unpredictible band.
B000002A3T|5.0|This is my favorite music album - I can't live without it.
B000B5UL7G|4.0|Long gone are the days of \\"The Ego Has Landed\\", but still an enjoyable disc. <br /> <br />
0307010856|5.0|I decided to search for this when someone asked for a list of good books for their child's library.  Oh, I'm so glad this one hasn't gone out of print!  My mother used to read this to me every night almost when I was little.  I got it with a McDonald's Happy Meal, actually!  Oh, how I loved this book and I hope someday that if I have children, they'll love it to.<br /><br />Get this one for the littles-it's a wonderful children's classic!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Since the episodes are in the order in which they were originally intended, rather than the order in which they aired on TV, it puts the story in perspective.  Designed to surprise the viewer, the show turns the genre on its head.  After watching this, it made me regret that no episodes more were available, so I rushed out to see the movie. Like most of Whedon's shows, it is an ensemble piece and the characters are delightful, the ship most of all. (4 stars because it stopped mid-season).
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This is one of the few albums of the last few years that really knocked me on my butt, along with Opeth and Nevermore's latest.    I always liked Nightwish, but to be honest, the slightly cheesy keyboards always kept them from really realising their potential. Where they tried to sound epic, they sometimes ended-up sounding a bit too close to Journey. Even with all the modern advancements, keyboards have their limitations when trying to sound like an orchestra. I remember listening to Century child and thinking, \\"Damn, imagine if they had a real orchestra\\". Well this time they do, and it makes a huge difference.    What used to sound a bit too poppy to me, now sounded properly epic and dark. \\"Once\\" sounds much more like the epic vampire movie soundtrack they've been trying to make, and that's a good thing. Picture the Lord Of The Rings soundtrack with Hetfield on Guitar. The guitars are chunkier and heavier as well. This is my absolute favourite, and I really hope they stay this course.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|The problem with most Dylan DVD videos is that there are too few of them that concentrate on the period when he was at the incandescent height of his genius but lots of them after he jumped the shark. For various reasons; possibly lack of appreciation at the time as well as Dylan's famous introverted antipathy to being filmed, there is little quality footage of this early and exciting period especially the electric with The Band. Don't Look Back is excellent but it is strictly acoustic. The Eat the Document Video is the closest thing I have seen but it contains so little of Dylan singing and performing and much is wasted on banal incidental peanut gallery footage for which its filmmaker (Pennebaker) deserves eternal condemnation. However, what snippets of Dylan singing and performing that it does contain are priceless gems that are poignant reminders of how great this film could have been. Now we finally have a film that lives up to the teasing and tintillation of Eat the Document. Pennebaker should take a lesson from Scorcese about how to make a real film and not a kaleidoscopic collage of garbage. No Direction Home is a true smorgasbord of bliss for the Dylan fan. Finally, we have the performances that have been denied us for so long. Scorcese gives us a nice chronological history of the rise of Dylan punctuated by numerous lengthy snippets of songs and performance footage. What is probably the icing on the cake are the full length performances added as special features that give us full length performances of a few classics such as Like a Rolling Stone. Finally we can see how Dylan looked and acted as he sang the classics we have experienced only through audio up until now.   <br />
B000092Q4U|2.0|I give these guys two stars because for mainstream metal, theyre not bad compared to what we had to deal with 5-10 years ago.  However, pretty much everything you will hear from them is a watered down version of other metal bands who already existed.   The band sounds more like hardcore to me, especially the completely gurgled and screamed vocals.  The guitar work is extremely repetitive not to mention I believe lamb of god has the worst guitar tone in the world, way to dry and abrasive.  I saw them live and this didn't change, they are a slow band with a horrible tone overall.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Please, do not read this article if you are not interested in a completely one sided view on perhaps the best cd in the entirety of the world. <br /> <br />Ok, we've all heard those great albums before; abbey road, picaresque, sea change, 13 tales.., high society, life and death.., in the aeroplane.., execution of all things........[some of my personal favorites] but, do any of those actually compare to radiohead's greatest album OK computer?  I realize what i've just said, i've just said that Ok computer is better than the beatles, yes, blasphamey, i know.  However, regardless of my lack of religion, this is entirely true.  Whenever you actually want to be moved by music, Ok Computer is there for you.  When ever you want to cry, OK computer is there for you.  Whenever you want to feel, OK computer is there for you.  This is THE album, and this WILL BE the album for quite some time, and quite frankly, as far as i'm concerned, could always continue to be that album.  This album is: spectacular, amazing, astonishing, astounding, breathtaking, daring, dazzling, dramatic, fabulous, fantastic, grand, histrionic, impressive, magnificent, marked, marvelous, miraculous, prodigious, razzle-dazzle, remarkable, sensational, splendid, staggering, striking, stunning, stupendous, theatrical, thrilling, and wonderous.  If you only own one album, this should be it.  Because this truly is THE ALBUM, undisputed.! <br /> <br />[Please excuse my excesive love for Ok computer, but once you listen to it, i don't think you'll be able to blame me]
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|I had always thought of behemoth as a typical black metal band based on all their older albums.  As soon I saw the video for \\"Conquer All\\" it changed all of my impressions, I had to check this album out.  The sound of this album can best be described as, well, behemoth.  It is huge and it feels like you're getting hit by a freight train as soon as you hear Nergals voice.  I don't know what he did or what effect he had on his voice, but it sounds like pure evil.  Another highlight is inferno's drumming, though many do not like triggered drums I love the sound of his set.  Blastbeats sound so precise and clear on this album.  Guitar work suits the music, its not paticularly complicated, in fact the solos sound really underdeveloped but overall it achieves this monolithic sound which is perfect.  Lyrics are pretty well written even though i dont really dig the whole black metal occult thing. <br /> <br />I wouldn't exactly call Demigod technical death metal because if you compare them to say nile or cryptospy, behemoth kinda of just chugs along, relying more on atmosphere instead of speed and complexity (nile is pretty atmospheric as well which is why theyre so awesome).  Nergal said it best calling his new style of music \\"extreme metal\\" which i think is a pretty good way of putting it.  Anyway, this is DEFINITELY an album worth getting and listening through and through, it is quite an experience.
B000067CPX|5.0|It's a great blend of alternative and pop with sophisticated and sincere lyrics that make this a timeless CD to add to a collection.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I'll start off by saying that, as a general rule, I really, REALLY hate science fiction. I enjoy fantasy, but the big, overblown, impersonal government-based plot lines that tend to bog down science fiction bores the crap out of me. <br /> <br />The great thing about rules is that they were made to be broken, and the Firefly franchise is one of the few exceptions I make in my \\"Sci-Fi is Booooring\\" rule, mostly because of the absurdly well-developed characterizations. Rarely are relationships so defined and multi-layered in BOOKS, let alone in TV and movies. <br /> <br />The movie doesn't disappoint with the characterizations, either. Although we get a very condensed version of what makes these people tick, Joss Whedon does a superb job of making both the fan and the casual viewer care about what happens to the crew of Serenity, and the actors are excellent at making those characters believable. <br /> <br />Just to focus on the antagonist for a moment, I can't remember the last time I've seen a bad guy so wonderfully written (or acted) in an action movie. Instead of creating a character who is flat-out evil, Whedon gives us a very human character who is eerily similar to the hero, Mal Reynolds in how he chooses to let his convictions and needs drive him, even when they make him do things that are evil. He's a monster, and he knows it, but he continues to be one because he truly believes the things he does will benefit mankind in the longrun. As a matter of fact, the BIGGEST difference between Mal and The Operative is that The Operative fits the profile of the stereotypical hero far better than Mal does. As far as I'm concerned, it's the best twist in the whole movie, but I'm weird about stuff like that. <br /> <br />Enough with the over-analysis! Summing up: The writing is fun, the characters are fabulous, the plot brings the action and also makes you think without shoving political statements down your throat, and the movie boasts some of the best underrated actorsin the business (Adam Baldwin, Alan Tudyk, Gina Torres, etc.). Watch this movie.
0375760067|5.0|I have not read any of Hardy's books before - and chanced upon this one, and found no regrets.  Once I developed a comfort zone in his type of writing, I found myself totally engrossed.  His literature style is one of grace and flowed easily between each new turn of the plot.  Not only was it beautifully done as a character building story, but it was full of surprises, twists and turns you didn't expect.  I recommend this book, and intend to continue reading the rest of his writings.
0792839749|5.0|I'd have to give this movie a very high review as a great family movie. <br />Until now I'd only seen bits and peaces of this movie.  Since, watching it in its' complete form I'd have to say it's very enjoyable.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Although some of Bob Dylan's most popular songs and albums were familiar to me from my earliest childhood, I never knew very  much about him or his history.  I watched this Scorsese documentary on TV (on the recommendation of  my ninety-year-old grandmother!) and then rushed to rent the DVD, which I've been watching again and again since.  It's riveting, especially part 2.      It's very interesting to learn about the historical period and the music scene, and some of the interviews, most notably with Allen Ginsberg, are fascinating, but what stand out most for me are the performances and the music.  It seems like Dylan absorbed many influences to invent practically a new art form that combines poetry, music, and performance.  When speaking he seems almost inarticulate.  But the lyrics in his songs excite both the ear and the mind; and the music, together with the rest of his performance, add even more interest, emotion, and pleasure.  Altogether, I found the music and performances, as well as the film, moving and exhilarating.  It does seem that something, if not the holy spirit exactly (as Bob Johnston, a record producer suggests), is speaking through Dylan.    Some of the performances that stood out the most for me before I go on with the rest of the review:     I enjoy the clip of a relatively short-haired Dylan playing \\"Chimes of Freedom\\" because the performance has such a youthful exuberance very different from some of his others; he smiles and bounces and is playful with the audience, using goofily exaggerated gestures to act out a kind of bashfulness, even telling the audience he loves them.  And, as usual, the lyrics, with their alliteration, rhyming, images, etc., are a treat.  We see Dylan's handwritten \\"Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail...\\"    Dylan's wordplay based on signs in the street at the beginning of Part 2 and the \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" clip from _Don't Look Back_, in which he holds up cards with words from the song on them, are wonderful, quick-paced fun, similar to a poetry slam.    But the later concert performances from 1965 and 1966 are the most stunning.  When I see the black-and-white clips of Dylan performing \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" and \\"Gates of Eden\\" I can well believe what Bob Neuwirth says, \\"No one had ever seen anything like this before.  No one had EVER seen ANYTHING LIKE this before.\\"  Or heard.  And I can also understand what Allen Ginsberg means when he says that Dylan at this point in his career became at certain moments \\"a column of air.  He had become one with his breath.\\"  The words and music, and Dylan's intense performance of them, seem utterly, almost shockingly, new and original.    His performance of \\"Maggie's Farm\\" at the Newport Folk Festival, where for the first time he publicly played with a rock band and was booed, has another kind of exciting energy.    And when I see Dylan performing \\"Visions of Johanna\\" on his 1966 tour, I understand what Tony Glover says in his notes to Vol. 4 of the Bootleg Series: \\"He has a wired-to-the-bone stoned fragility that makes it look like he might vanish in a burst of flame at any second....You can see the ghost of electricity in the bones of his face for sure....\\"  Incandescent.  It is moving to see how much emotion he feels while performing, to see how close to the edge he is living, and to see the defiant energy with which he responds to the hostile audience when he plays \\"Like a Rolling Stone.\\"    Various people who worked with Dylan describe what fun it was to work on _Bringing It All Back Home_ and _Highway 61 Revisited_.  Bob Johnston, the record producer, says that the music was changed \\"by freedom.\\"  There were no clocks, people just came in and played and experimented together, and \\"Dylan just always did what he wanted.\\" We get to hear how the songs changed, and we get to hear the brilliant first verse of \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" and part of the wonderful \\"Ballad of a Thin Man.\\"    Seeing all these various moods, personas, and sides of Dylan and watching his development is fascinating.  I guess all along he's trying to be \\"who I am\\" though other people just want him \\"to be like them.\\"  (Sorry, I haven't quite memorized all his lyrics yet.) I agree with Dylan that his later songs are just as much protest songs as his earlier ones, but I wish he'd been able to connect the personal with the political more in his later songwriting, to combine the rock band, surrealist lyrics, and introspection with more direct politics and social consciousness--after all, what could be more surreal than politics and the workings of power? And what has more effect on the lives and feelings of all of us? (Also, I have to say that, even taking into account his youth, his inebriated state, the emerging battle between the generations, and his discomfort at feeling pigeonholed into a role he doesn't want, his speech to the Emergency Civil Rights Committee is very painful to hear.  I couldn't imagine how he could have the stupidity and gall to think such things and to say them to the likes of James Baldwin and other people who were fighting such hard, essential battles for all of our lives--and who were giving him an award--until I read on the Internet his explanation of what he meant and why he said it.) Nevertheless, I have to feel glad when he says that he \\"ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.\\"  Home is where the creative spirit is.    Scorsese follows the thread of \\"home.\\" Dylan says that when he was a child, listening to country music on the radio made him feel like someone else, a totally different person from somewhere else, who maybe even had different parents.  He leaves home the day after graduating from high school.  He goes through different artistic stages and says that artists must be careful never to think that they've arrived, that they'll be okay as long as they're constantly in a state of becoming.  On his European tour before his 1966 motorcycle accident, we hear him talking about how long he's been on the road and then asking someone, \\"do you know what home is?,\\" and saying that he doesn't want to travel anymore, that he doesn't want to die in a plane crash in Sicily, that he just wants to go home.  And then there's the \\"Judas concert\\" clip that ends the movie with the poignant \\"how does it feel, to be on your own, with no direction home, like a rolling stone?\\" (\\"Lay Down Your Weary Tune\\" plays during some of the closing credits.)    The music and images in the last sequence of the movie, starting with \\"Visions of Johanna,\\" are especially powerful.  Now I want to buy all of Dylan's CDs through 1966.  My grandmother is looking forward to listening to them too.    Does anyone know of any comparable songwriter?
B000AARKOO|2.0|I took a chance on this DVD because it was Ridley Scott - how bad could something be from the guy who brought us Blade Runner, Alien, and Black Hawk Down?  I should have remembered that he also brought us Thelma & Louise and the execrable \\"1492: Conquest of Paradise\\".<br /><br />The best description of this movie might not be \\"vapid\\", but rather \\"frivolous\\".  From the thorough weakness of the plot, to the crayola-poster-paint subtlety of the characters, Scott does little more than superimpose a bland european/secularist sermon on tolerance on top of an overly simplified historical backdrop.<br /><br />The opening mood of cold-drab Europe vs. dusty but civilized Palestine sets the stage for Scott's efforts.  The combat sequences incorporate the most vivid of Scott's trademark cinemaviolence, and this, along with the \\"Can't We All Just Get-Along\\" theme, make one feel as if they're watching the Rodney King video.<br /><br />Overall, a bland effort from a preachy, occasionally talented director.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Oh, Tim Burton, I never lost my faith in you. After Burton's output significantly slowed down during the late '90s, some wondered if his best years were behind him. Then Burton follows up his excellent 1999 pic Sleepy Hollow with a dreadful remake of the sci-fi classic, Planet of the Apes. Oh dear. Will we never see another Burtonian masterpiece? Will we never be blessed with another imaginative fairytale like Edward Scissorhands? Or an oddball biopic like Ed Wood? Or a dark comic tale like Batman Returns? Well, perhaps the failure of Planet of the Apes shook Burton back to his senses. He returned, as if from a sabbatical in the depths of the Batcave, in 2003 with a fabulous movie called Big Fish. Ah yes, this is the Tim Burton that we love. Now in 2005 we have two new Burton flicks to savor. Corpse Bride, another stop-motion triumph marrying Burton's macabre characters with Edgar Allan Poe sensibilities, and of course, a live action marvel of a movie: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Tim Burton is back with a vengeance!!    Now while I loved Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is without a doubt Burton's best movie in a decade. It's all here - everything that we love about Tim Burton as a storyteller. All of his trademarks, the creepy, kooky, mysterious and spooky, are all here in abundance. Roald Dahl's classic book was begging for a Burtonization. Why did no one think of this sooner? Johnny Depp takes the role of the mysterious candy maker Willy Wonka, in what is sure to be a controversial performance among fans. I thought he was great. He does not attempt to recapture Gene Wilder's Wonka in any way. Depp recreates the character as his own. Tim Burton also found a perfect Charlie in Freddie Highmore. As the key character in the movie, Highmore's Charlie is always believable and sympathetic. David Kelly is simply a delight as Grandpa Joe. I also loved Deep Roy's performance(s) as the Oompa Loompas. I love that Burton went in a completely different direction and didn't try to copy the Oompa Loompas of the 1971 film. Burton's Oompa Loompas are far more fun and imaginative.     You've also got marvelous production design and Tim Burton's visual genius which bring to life Roald Dahl's world in a way that we've never imagined. This movie simply looks splendid. Scrumdiddlyumptious, if you will. The production design and art direction should certainly get Oscar nominations next February. Then we have Danny Elfman's excellent music. Just what would a Tim Burton movie be without a Danny Elfman score? As always, Elfman captures the perfect tone for this wild, fantastic world. One of the best additions to this movie is the subplot featuring the great Christopher Lee as Willy Wonka's father. That's exactly what the story needed, a bit more dramatic depth and some additional characterization for Wonka.     Fans of the 1971 Gene Wilder version will certainly have much to debate upon seeing this new movie. I personally feel that this movie far surpasses the 1971 movie. I am a big fan of the old one, yes, but I always felt that Gene Wilder's excellent performance stood head and shoulders above the rest of the movie. Peter Ostrum's Charlie was less compelling than he should have been and none of the other characters were particularly fleshed out enough for me to care about them. I did love the movie's sense of dark humor, but as a whole I felt it was a flawed as a story. However, in comparison, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is practically flawless. I honestly loved everything about this movie. There is not one complaint or quibble I have with it. This is quite simply everything I could have wished for in a Tim Burton take on Roald Dahl's story. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a Tim Burton masterpiece. His best movie since 1994's Ed Wood and one of the best movies of 2005.

B000AYQJ3I|5.0|John Sinnott has given a near perfect review, so I won't replicate point by point his findings.  I am in full agreement.  I just wanted to offer another positive data point to corroborate that this is a great package.<br /><br />I was not expecting much based on the date of the concert and the recording technology of that era.  I bought this simply to have it as a historical document of some of my favorite musicians from a time in the past that I remember from my youth.  George Harrison is also someone that I admire and since he is gone, older footage is all we can have now.  The bottom line is that I was going to buy this set even if it was in mono with a degraded image.  The good news is that some technicians have earned their money on this restoration project.  This could have been filmed and recorded this year based on the clarity of the image and the truly fine 5.1 sound.  I know that this sound is rendered 5.1 well after the fact, since it was recorded in basic left / right channel stereo, but it is very convincing to me as the sound comes out of my rear speakers at just the right mix with the front speakers.<br /><br />While the concert is great, I really love disc 2.  There are many treats here that will make disc 1 more enjoyable.  The navigation for the special features is great.  You can for example click on \\"Eric Clapton\\" and some highlights of his playing (from the concert) will pop up, and then transition to a modern day Clapton offering reflections on that day, including references to his drug use and having picked the wrong guitar.  The great bond between Harrison and Dylan comes through in the rehearsal footage, and Dylan looks so young and vital that you have to remember how long ago this was filmed.  These were great performances from a great time that were saved on film for eternity... lucky us!<br /><br />This would be a great DVD set if it were recorded last week with the most modern gear.  That it was shot so long ago and still comes through with a clarity and sound that rivals current issued DVDs, is a testament to the engineers that poured their talent into making this a product they could be proud of.  They have succeeded and we are all the winners.  Don't wait, get this DVD set!ough with a clarity and sound that rivals current issued DVDs, is a testament to the engineers that poured their talent into making this a product they could be proud of.

B000AA305M|5.0|If you enjoy David Gray's music his latest album, Life In Slow Motion, will not disappoint. It is a bit more studio driven, with a more controlled sound. This is in contrast with White Ladder, which was supposedly recorded in a room with the windows open. Life In Slow Motion is not a revolutionary album, or a major departure for Gray. However, it is packed with good songs which run in the same vein as his typical style. He seems to use more piano on this album and some of the songs sound vaguely Coldplay-esque. If you have his recent albums and enjoy them, or if you like a few of the new songs you might have heard on the radio then get this album. You will not be disappointed.

In some country's that's not a wise thing to do, but I'm a pigheaded man, just like my chauffeur Jan, who does what he can, who always drives a few yards behind me, in case I'll get tired. I never get tired, because I've got my principles when I'm on my bike: I only go downhill. And when there's no hill, i'll think of one.     Well, that's the live of an honest man's about: doing nothing untill he's forced to do something. And that's what the hard working people should learn from me: do nothing but letting the money come rolling your way. Bye bye Jan, I'm taking the bikeway!      And sometimes I think a tandem would be nice to. The front saddle is for me and the back saddle is for Jan. Then I can go uphill as well. On windy days Jan can ride in front. That would be just like we were in the Sedan! Mayby Paul should learn this lesson.

0446577383|5.0|Thrilling, fast-paced and wholly thought-provoking, The Camel Club may well be David Baldacci's finest work yet.  This tale of intrigue and nefarious dealings follows the adventures of four misfits (albeit lovable misfits) who, though seemingly eccentric and devoid of power, are inherently brilliant.  Their shadowy pasts make them extremely well-suited to sniff out the conspiracies of the day and analyze the frightening state of world events.  Witnesses to murder late one night on the banks of the Potomac River, they soon find themselves embroiled in an enormous conspiracy involving the highest levels of government - a conspiracy the likes of which I dare say no reader will ever guess at.   <br /> <br />Tautly plotted and chock full of the memorable characters that Baldacci fans have come to expect and appreciate, The Camel Club is a winner from start to finish - a page-turner extraordinaire.  If you are planning to read it, clear your calendar, because once you dive in, you won't want to stop turning the pages for anything.  Even sleep and nourishment will seem unnecessary.  Trust me.   <br />
0761957553|3.0|Can I give 3.14 stars? LOL<br /><br />I will have to say this one, \\"SPSS Survival Manual\\" is the winner.<br /><br />I've owned this book and a few others on SPSS and or multivariate data analysis for several years.  However, a friend of mine recently called me and asked me how to do a few less ordinary things in SPSS.  After spending some time on the phone with him I decided to look back at these books and suggest/give one to my friend.<br /><br />I think the \\"SPSS Survival Manual\\" by Julie Pallant is somewhat of an easier read for the graduate student or market researcher who wants to quickly look up a certain how-to topic for SPSS.<br /><br />\\"Discovering Statistics Using SPSS for Windows\\" by Andy Field, on the other hand goes into more detail on the statistics behind the techniques in SPSS.  This one reads a little more like a text book though and can be a bit dry/technical unless this is your thing.<br /><br />I tested the two by seeing which would do a better job of explaining how to conduct a Factor Analysis (PCA) in SPSS.  \\"Discovering Statistics...\\" by Andy Field would have lost my friend right away, and by page three or four is listing formulas and quadrant plots.  \\"SPSS Survival Manual\\" by Pallant on the other hand got into the `how to' part rather quickly with clear to follow examples.<br /><br />If you're like my friend/more into getting it done quickly and correctly without getting bogged down with the academic detail, then definitely purchase the \\"SPSS Survival Manual\\".<br /><br />If on the other hand you're not scared of a little extra math/statistics and have the extra time, you may want to think about \\"Discovering Statistics\\".<br /><br />However, for the hard core multivariate analytics people, neither of these books will due.  I would suggest something like \\"Multivariate Data Analysis\\" by Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black.  This goes a few steps beyond Andy Fields Book.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.<br /><br />Tom Anderson<br />Anderson Analytics, LLC<br />[...]
B000B5UL7G|5.0|For anyone who doubted Rob Williams could do it without Guy - take a look at him now. He continues the tradition of putting out thoughtful, well written, well sung songs - now with a new partner, but still his own soul in each song. I have listened to all the tracks on the BBC, and on his website and he has several new singles in the mix. Advertising Space is an easy number one spot, and his melodic King of Bloke and Bird will tug at your heart. The Trouble with Me, ostensibly written for his ex-girl Rachel is exquisite, and touches on the reality that is Robbie. Always alone.  <br /> <br />As a woman with a Mr., my heart goes out to him since he has no Mrs., but the music would not be the same if he did. We are treated to his joys and sorrows, but mostly now his sorrows. Get this album and enjoy a true entertainer. And Rob, could you get a girl so your next album will be a bit more upbeat?
0307276902|3.0|OK--I get it: The fragmented, free-for-all narrative mirrors the narrator's own tattered consciousness, his own turmoil, his own f-you to The Establishment.   <br />Still, a good editor could have trimmed some of the extraneous passages (I skimmed over so many long descriptions of vomit I quit counting) and brought some sense to the Random Capitalization Syndrome that Infects the Novel. <br />Not nearly as good as Augusten Burrough's Dry, set in the same rehab center, because that book has a sense of humor, something sorely lacking here.
067144901X|5.0|I have a 10 week old and I have been reading him this book for the last couple of weeks.  He just loves it.  It is so simple and he loves all the sounds that each animal makes.  I didn't think he would care to be read too at such a young age but he really does enjoy each and every day I read it to him.
6305971099|1.0|This movie is even worse than number four. Take my advice and stick with the true Halloween trilogy: 1, 2, and 7.
B000AARKOO|3.0|This was a good movie and between having to explain the true historical events and plot to my husband I found it ok. I was upset that Liam Neeson bit it so soon, but I do see how it added to the story. I dont see how Orlando Bloom went from not knowing anything about combat to leading armies. I was left lacking in his transition from blacksmith to leader of an army. I also wondered what became of his quest to save his wife's soul, he went from devoted, mourning husband to falling for the princess. I found the chemistry between Orlando Bloom and Eva Green lacking. I also found her character lacking the depth that the plot implied she was supposed to have. The movie leads you to think he is going on a quest to free his wife's soul from eternal hell and then forgets all about her. It provides no background on any of the characters and that leaves you wanting a little too. Over all... it's an okay way to waste 2.5 hours. I bought it but probably wont watch it again.
0783114893|5.0|I saw this on AMC recently and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I can clearly see that this is both a reimagining and a tribute to Steven Speilberg's first film, \\"DUEL.\\" This movie is every bit as good as Duel. Get yours today.
0800177177|4.0|This is a good movie; it offers a different perspective on Dracula. The movie is more about Dracula the man than Dracula the monster.
B000059MEK|5.0|Just how good is DAFT PUNK's DISCOVERY?  Over 4 years later the music is still so fresh that Hollywood/Celeb shows on channels such as MTV and VHI consistently play these songs in the background.  What can one say?....simply the best electronica/dance record ever released.   <br /> <br />DAFT PUNK CDS (RANKED): <br /> <br />1) DISCOVER (2001) <br />A Classic <br /> <br />2) HOMEWORK (1997)  <br />The album that propelled DAFT PUNK into worldwide stardom with tracks such as AROUND THE WORLD.  For those who think HOMEWORK is better than DISCOVER - don't try it, you will not win.  I know many DAFT PUNK fans loyally worship this album however to me DISCOVERY is much better. HOMEWORK sounds a little dated, like it \\"sounds 1997\\". <br /> <br />3) HUMAN AFTER ALL (2004)  <br />I have to say I was disappointed with this one, with PRIMETIME, MAKE LOVE, and EMOTION the only decent songs. For those looking for DISCOVERY part 2 steer clear of this album.  Also the songs are VERY, VERY repetitive.  One could make an argument that DISCOVERY is repetitive also, however the the songs are so phenomenal you hardly even notice.
0143034901|5.0|This is one of the best books  I have read recently.  I could not put it down.  I was shocked at every turn and my heart was racing throughout the entire saga.  FANTASTIC BOOK!!!!

B00009UW0N|5.0|This is actually a slasher film that works. The plot: A maniacal young man named Michael Myers murders his older sister and then gets put into a mental institution. 15 years later, He escapes from the institution with the intent of killing his other sister, Whose name is Laurie Strode [Played by Jamie Lee Curtis, In what was her film debut] and it's up to Dr. Loomis [Played by Donald Pleasance, Who gives the best performance in the movie] to stop the demented killer from killing again. This is a thrilling, Low-budget horror movie and this movie actually keeps you watching and there's actually some story to it [I hate most horror films that have just straight killing and little else to go with it]. This is a classic in every way and i think that anyone who hasn't seen this yet should absolutely love this movie. I wish they made horror movies like this today. I also dig the classic score to this film. Followed by seven sequels, None of which even compare to this movie. Hope my review helped. Be blessed, Have a nice day.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I enjoy watching the series with my family to teach them about leadership in engineering.  Some of the scenes show where the NASA engineers did not know how to do something, but they dreamed and then they worked together to build.  Sometimes there were setbacks, but they learned and accomplished the mission.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have been a follower of Coldplay since their debut album, Parachutes. While both previous albums have been fabulous, X&Y surpasses all expectations. The lyrics are more mature, more touching and the instrumentals more dynamic and layered. My only hope is that Coldplay does not become more commercial.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I frequently overlook Michael Buble's albums for some time now, whenever I'm at HMV. However, one morning I sam him at GMTV and he sang the song \\"Home\\" and I was absolutely stunned by this young man's performance! It was live! <br /> <br />One thing that melted me whilst listening to this album, specially to this song is that Michael sings not only with passion, but with truth and honesty as well. Opera singers do usually have this gift, and some pop singers (Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin.) <br /> <br />His technique is impeccable, his breathing is soulful, yes, it's not a soul album but an album with a soul. The song  Home and You and I are specially beautiful. Streisand sang this in her 1972 Lazy Afternoon Album, way way before Mr Buble was born!!! <br /> <br />I do hope ther'll be a Streisand and Buble duet! His voice is more suitable to love songs and ballads, rather that Sinatraesque songs. <br /> <br />Some compare him with Josh Groban, but whilst Josh Groban is a superb singer, somehow, his singing is empty and cold, his technique is too perfect and soul less, Michael Buble's the opposite. It's like caressing your favourite pillow or having an exquisite bath. It's makes one very comfortable, at home and happy. <br /> <br />I'm so happy he's coming to Scotland in a forthnight. There's just one ticket left at the SECC in Glasgow and thank goodness I was able to get it. (No more tickets at the Edinburgh Playhouse!!!) <br /> <br />WE LOVE MICHAEL!!! XXX <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|People keep commenting on Coldplay, U2 is 20 years ahead of coldplay and they'll have to retire before Coldplay takes over. even the Killers lead singer said they are the best act in the world and so did Chris Martin for that matter. Take it from teh pro's who even say U2 is the world's best band. This is an era of U2 still, but one day Coldplay will have it, but not now. Plus, Coldplay's music sounds almost exactly like U2's music. (Miracle Drug)(Speed of Sound). Very similar at times. Either way u2 is still a great act and I can't believe all of these negative reviews.
1932907009|5.0|I have taught screenwriting for ten years.  I'm a WGA lifetime member.  Three of my feature scripts have been produced.  SAVE THE CAT may not be the last book you'll need, but it certainly is the first. <br /> <br />It's the only book I know of that's written by a successful writer.  Blake Snyder understands how Hollywood works.  He understands storytelling.  He really, really understands screenwriting... and at the end of the book, the reader understands it too. <br /> <br />SAVE THE CAT is clear, makes perfect sense, and has revolutionized my classroom.  My students are turning in better structured screenplays than I've ever gotten before.  They think the book is fantastic. <br /> <br />Screenwriting books abound.  A few are very good.  This is the best one.
B00000FCBC|4.0|After releasing two experimental and controversial albums which were deemed \\"sell-outs\\" by fans, it probably wasn't the wisest of moves to make a covers album. Thus, if you thought Metallica sold out with \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload,\\" this won't change your mind. And like all covers albums, \\"Garage, Inc.\\" won't go down in history as being a classic, and I think Metallica should have covered more heavy metal bands (maybe pay more homage to Iron Maiden or Black Sabbath), but it's still a great compilation. Everything from country (Lynyrd Skynyrd) to classic rock (Queen) to punk (The Misfits, Discharge) to hard rock (Thin Lizzy) and metal (Motorhead, Diamond Head) is covered here. Metallica usually do a great job covering the songs, and they make them their own about 75% of the time. Plus, some of the songs (\\"Turn The Page,\\" \\"Breadfan,\\" \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\") were good enough to even receive radio play. It's not a perfect album, though, as you'll see below:<br /><br />Disc One:<br /><br />1. \\"Free Speech For The Dumb:\\" It's catchy and has fast, chugging riffs, but it's too short. 8/10.<br />2. \\"It's Electric:\\" Also very catchy, with a nice Hammett solo. Rating: 9/10.<br />3. \\"Sabbra Cadabra:\\" It has some wailing guitar noise, but, other than that, this song is really quite boring. 7/10.<br />4. \\"Turn The Page:\\" James' voice really makes this song his own. I'd swear this was a \\"Load\\" b-side if I didn't know better. 10/10.<br />5. \\"Die Die My Darling:\\" I enjoy this song's catchy, skipping rhythm. 8/10.<br />6. \\"Loverman:\\" Aside from the loud choruses, this song is just flat-out annoying. James really doesn't do a good job delivering the lyrics, either. 3/10.<br />7. \\"Mercyful Fate:\\" Nice-and-energetic with some great guitar work, but this song is WAY too long. 7.5/10.<br />8. \\"Astronomy:\\" This song builds a little bit, but it doesn't really go anywhere. 6/10.<br />9. \\"Whiskey In The Jar:\\" Even though it also has a \\"Load\\" feel to it, this song is also pretty darn boring! 5.5/10.<br />10. \\"Tuesday's Gone:\\" If you've heard this song somewhere before, you probably used to watch the old T.V. show \\"The Wonder Years.\\" I enjoy this song, it's slow, laid back, and has a southern country feel to it. Nice use of the harmonica, too. 8.5/10.<br />11. \\"The More I See:\\" Not a spectacular song, but its drum beat and churning guitars make it pretty catchy. 7.5/10.<br /><br />Final rating: 80/110.<br /><br />Disc Two:<br /><br />1. \\"Helpless:\\" Pretty good. It's fast and has buzzing guitars, but it comes across sounding like Metallica tried to cover a punk song (not a hard rock one). And even though another nice guitar solo is included here, this song drags on for too long without ending. Rating: 7.5/10.<br />2. \\"The Small Hours:\\" It's too slow and repetitive, but the churning riffs and beeping bass make this song decent. 7/10.<br />3. \\"The Wait:\\" Nice, grinding guitars, but this song doesn't go anywhere. 6.5/10.<br />4. \\"Crash Course In Brain Surgery:\\" Good, pounding rhythm. 8/10.<br />5. \\"Last Caress/Green Hell:\\" Probably the fastest song on here. 8.5/10<br />6. \\"Am I Evil?:\\" James' vocals give this song an old school vibe. This song also has a cool, extended solo. 9/10.<br />7. \\"Blitzkrieg:\\" More catchy, chugging guitars on this song, and a three part guitar solo also flares up. 9/10.<br />8. \\"Breadfan:\\" A very catchy song with a great, memorable main riff. This track kind of sounds like a \\"Kill `Em All\\" b-side. 10/10.<br />9. \\"The Prince:\\" Good, fast, wild guitar work at the beginning. 8/10.<br />10. \\"Stone Cold Crazy:\\" Probably the catchiest and most famous song on here. 10/10.<br />11. \\"So What:\\" An extremely aggressive and surprisingly profane (therefore out of place) song. It sounds OK, though. 5/10.<br />12. \\"Killing Time:\\" Pretty catchy. 8/10.<br />13. \\"Overkill:\\" Except for James' vocals, this song sounds very much like the band that originally recorded this song (Motorhead). 8/10.<br />14. \\"Damage Case:\\" This song has another catchy rhythm, and a pair of superb Hammett solos. 9/10.<br />15. \\"Stone Dead Forever:\\" Quite catchy. 8/10.<br />16. \\"Too Late Too Late:\\" Also quite catchy, with another strong Motorhead vibe. 8/10.<br /><br />Final rating: 129.5/160.<br />Final rating for both discs: 209.5/270=77%.<br /><br />So, \\"Garage, Inc\\" definitely has its ups and downs. It's certainly not for metal casual fans, fans who think Metallica sold out, or people with short attention spans (because it's well over two hours long). But everybody else should definitely check this album out because the bottom line is \\"Garage, Inc.\\" is great for what it is (a covers album). And if you don't like cover songs, at least buy this C.D. so you can say you have a complete Metallica collection.another strong Motorhead vibe. 8/10.    Final rating: 129.5/160.  Final rating for both discs: 209.5/270=77%.    So, \\"Garage, Inc\\" definitely has its ups and downs.

B000AL730Y|5.0|This album from start to finish is amazing.  It just shows that when he lets his musical guard down, trusts an outside source of direction, his best works flows through.  This is his most pesonal group of songs in decades.  They are not overproduced with sometimes sparse arrangements.  McCartney plays almost all the instruments ala 'McCartney' and it makes all the difference.  His vocals are not polluted with reverb or overdone.  They showcase a vulnerability in his persona and it draws you in.  He shows us once again why without him, the Beatles would have been just another British Invasion group and not the iconic band that changed rock and roll forever.
0345423496|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first three books in the Odyssey series.  They each had one thing that this book completely lacks: Plot.   <br /> <br />3001 seemed to have been slapped together in a week.  The actual events that do occur in the story seem to have been thrown in as diversions to are long, dull, obsolete essays by Clarke on his perspective on religion and the moral state of the human race.  These soapbox asides are clumsy, polemic, and not substantiated adequately.  If you want to read a decent gripe about how self-destructive we are, read something by Kurt Vonnegut instead. <br /> <br />Clarke also seemed overwhelmed by the task of catching Poole up on 1000 years of history.  Every character he talks to makes references to the 20th Century; it makes one wonder if nothing interesting happened over the 1000 years Poole was dead outside of improvements in space exploration and industry.  Compare what you know about 1000 A.D. to what the characters in 3001 know about 2000 A.D., and the book becomes absurd pretty quickly (braincaps aside).   <br /> <br />Overall, 3001 was incredibly disappointing.  The climactic confrontation simply is not; it reads like a deus ex machina.  Clarke's whole perception of what mankind would be like in 3001 seems terribly amiss and too simple (especially in regards to attitudes concerning weapons of mass destruction). <br /> <br />If you really just want to say that you've read the entire series, get this from the library and get through it as quickly as possible.  Don't pay a cent for it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Although this Phantom is lacking the emotional impact of the stage production, it is a non the less wonderful, and well worth the purchase and viewing.  I have been fortunate in that I saw the stage production in a glorious and huge theater with the actors who added so much to the production - - the spectacular talents of Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford performing the lead roles.   <br /> <br />Those who saw the stage production should not be disappointed in the least in the film, nor of the performers.  The voice of the young lady portraying Christine - Emmy Rossum - will particularly amaze you.  It is different than the stage version - but great in it's own right. <br /> <br />This is a must see film.

Everything you pretty much need to know about the progression of Batman from the comic pages of D.C. to the big screen release of the first film is here. If there is a reason to get this box set this is it. Big thumbs up.<br /><br />\\"Legends OF The Dark Knight: The History Of Batman\\"<br />Need another reason to own this box set? here it is. Doc covers the complete history of Batman, from an idea of Bob Kane's, to comic hero, to T.V. star of the 60's, to big screen Dark Knight hero of the 80's & 90's. Another big thumbs up.<br /><br />\\"Batman\\" Documentary Gallery - O.K. look behind the scenes at making the film. From the gadgets & sets, to the costumes & the score. Cool enough to look at, but, something you would expect from a box set like this.<br /><br />Hero & Villians Profiles - basically, a bit of a rehash look at the main characters from the first film.<br /><br />Robin storyboard sequence - an idea that was dropped & might have actually pissed off a lot \\"Batman\\" fans. Basically, it's a chase sequence with Batman chasing The Joker through the streets of Gotham City. The chase eventually leads to a circus, The Flying Graysons, & the origin of Robin. I, personally, thought this sequence was overkill & makes you question did the filmakers need to have the Joker be responsible for both the origins of Batman & Robin?<br /><br />Prince's music videos - yup. Oversexed & silly even for it's time. I couldn't even sit through watching \\"Batdance\\". Prince is O.K., but, can you really take a man seriously when he's dressed as half-bat, half-clown? I call it half-as*ed.<br /><br />\\"Batman Returns\\"<br />- Disc 1: Feature film & theatrical trailer (yeah, just one)<br />- Disc 2: \\"The Bat, The Cat, & The Penguin\\" - original CBS special shown with a repeat showing of \\"Batman\\" in June of 1992, a couple of weeks before the release of \\"Batman Returns\\".

B000007ODM|4.0|Perfect music for one or a couple. Relax - listen - and visualize. <br />Close your eyes and see visions - its music that allows ones imagination the freedom to muse to a listener's satisfaction.  Great also as accompaniment for you and your significant other to enjoy each other's company.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|If you found out who you were in the 60s this film will bring it all back. <br />Seeing Bob and Joan Baez as young people makes the viewer feel young <br />again as well.    The story line sort of follows Bob's growth as a performer <br />and an observer of the human condition.  It's the kind of piece you can <br />watch again and again, and get something different from each viewing.
B00079FUI6|5.0|This is a great first season collection. Special features really add to owning this DVD set. The ladies are awesome and this DVD set is a great way to catch up to this season 3.
0793518326|4.0|Some brief comments ... <br /> <br />The quality of the product is excellent. The binding is good, the paper is thin but opaque and lies flat when resting on a music stand or on the piano! The slip case should keep the book in good nick! <br /> <br />My wife and kids are impressed. The only downside is the size of notation and text. For weak eyes it requires magnification. <br /> <br />To get the fifth star from me, a larger page size is in order. <br /> <br />I'm very happy I got it ... even though I was not a BIG Beatles fan in my youth. Beatles music is fun ... although some of its philosophical implications are scary if taken seriously. <br /> <br />Definitely worth it if you want to play the music for yourself on an instrument or two. <br /> <br />Cheers, <br /> <br />:-) <br /> <br />PK
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Amazing is definitly the word for this movie. Though historical settings were exagerated it helped to add to the movie's grandness. This was a spactacular performance but Brad Pitt and the Motion Picture Soundtrack is a must to hear.
B0009I7NOO|4.0|Oasis has been quiet for a while now, but now they come back at us with Don't Believe the Truth. I'm not sure I understand that title, though, unless the truth to them is that this album is horrible or something. Actually, that's what some people seem to think, but I personally think it's pretty damn good.<br /><br />I think I'll ignore the inevitable comparisons to other bands (I understand the Beatles ones, but I don't get the Pearl Jam ones) and just say that there are plenty of good songs to find on here. \\"Lyla\\" was fine to release as a single, but I find myself looking to the other songs instead. Introspective tales like \\"The Meaning of Soul\\" and \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" are sure to impress, as does \\"Let There Be Love\\", a successful we-are-the-world song.<br /><br />This album was released rather quietly, and it's not doing very well on the charts, so I don't know if enough people even know this album exists. But believe the truth: Oasis is back.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B0006SSOHC|3.0|It was a geneously nerve pinching movie, acting was tiring at times but Leigh Whannell's performance in the last two minutes of the film was orgasmic, you can't beat seeing that kind of true-intense fear on a cute guys face. I would recommend it to a select audience but enforce the fact that it's a good nighttime movie. You aren't afraid of the dark are you?
B0000TB01Y|4.0|For those of us who have seen this amazing show, listening to this soundtrack is like being in the theater all over again reliving the experience. <br /> <br />If you loved the show, you will certainly enjoyed this CD with the original cast.   <br /> <br />Stephen Schwartz who wrote the music for Godspell knows how to make his music very memorable so that you remember it after only hearing it once.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|I bought this album about three months ago. I listened through it once, added \\"Hellrider\\" to my growing \\"Priest Greatest Hits\\" playlist, and set the album aside. After several months of musical discovery, I'm going through my extensive CD collection, and find it buried in one of the stacks. I decide to pop it in, just for the hell of it.  <br /> <br />I was blown away. As if listening to it for the first time. From the first scream of vengeance on the opener \\"Judas Rising\\" (My favorite song by the way), I knew that this was going to be one hell of a ride. Read on for my song reviews. <br /> <br />\\"Judas Rising\\" - 5/5 <br />One of the strongest opening tracks Priest ever made (and THAT's saying something). A brief shred by guitarist Glen Tipton followed by the evil and ominous opening riff, and Halford's signature banshee screech, leads into an epic (but too short for my tastes)  masterpiece. Also, one of the best guitar solos on the album. <br /> <br />\\"Forged out of flame, <br />from chaos to destiny... <br />Bringer of pain, <br />forever undying... <br />JUDAS IS RISING!\\" <br /> <br />\\"Deal with the Devil\\" - 4/5 <br />Typical Priest fare (and that's NOT a bad thing), fast, and furious, and a prime example of Tipton and Downing's relentless dual guitar attack. Sounds like it would have fit in perfectly in the Painkiller album. <br /> <br />\\"Nothing held us back or dared to try.... <br />Something in our blood won't let us die... <br />Gotta deal with the devil!\\" <br /> <br />\\"Revolution\\" - 2/5 <br />One of the very few weak points in this album. It's a typical Priest anthem, which isn't necessarily horrible, but sounds very recycled and somewhat tired. Starts off with some distorted bass (very cool) leading into a mid-tempo anthem. Listenable, but not a very strong entry.  <br /> <br />\\"If you think it's over, better think again <br />There'll be no compromise. <br />Turning up the power, feel adrenaline,  <br />move into overdrive!\\" <br /> <br />\\"Worth Fighting For\\" - 5/5 <br />I absolutely love this song. The opening riff is beautiful and ominous at the same time. The whole song shows a very strong sense of melody, while retaining its heaviness, and is complemented by one of Halford's best vocal performances on the album. None of his renowned screaming, but lower and very harmonious vocals, backed with an addictive chorus, make this is a great song. <br /> <br />\\"So I wander on, <br />Asking where you might have gone <br />From what I knew before, <br />Some things are worth fighting for\\" <br /> <br />\\"Demonizer\\" - 3/5 <br />Back to the grind, with another hard'n heavy headbanger. Again sounds like a leftover from the Painkiller period. Sounds somewhat generic when compared to other Priest material, but good nonetheless. <br /> <br />\\"Hellions the steed, <br />Blood's on the wing, <br />Claws set to slice, <br />Vengeance he'll bring!\\" <br /> <br />\\"Wheels of Fire\\" - 4/5 <br />More prime headbanging material. In this song, Priest continues its tradition of biker songs, folowing a line of hits like \\"Hell-bent for Leather\\", and \\"Freewheel Burning\\". A bit slower than the previously mentioned songs, but still a great song. Two tons of flaming steel coming down on your eardrums. And another infectious chorus. Enjoy. <br /> <br />\\"Angel\\" - 4/5 <br />And now, Priest's hidden strength emerges for one of those rare and memorable occasions: A beautifully sung ballad, sad and powerful at the same time. Comparable to \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\", and \\"Dreamer Deciever\\", both classic ballads from Priest's 70's era. Many people hate this song, and I CANNOT figure out why. <br /> <br />\\"Angel we'll meet once more I'll pray, <br />When all my sins are washed away... <br />Hold me inside your wings and stay... <br />Angel take me far away\\" <br /> <br />\\"Hellrider\\" - 3/5 <br />Another \\"biker gang from hell\\" song, which is a theme Priest has milked for all it's worth. Cheesy lyrics and all. Even so, this is another great song, sounding likea cross etween two eras: Defenders of the Faith, and Painkiller. Tipton still knows how to shred, and he shows his chops in this song to great effect. <br /> <br />\\"Fight undying and eternal, <br />Wheels bring death and pain infernal, <br />Honour bound your strength repleted, <br />To no end they're undefeated\\" <br /> <br />\\"Eulogy\\" - 3/5 <br />I really cannot count this as a full song, although it reaches near the three minute mark. To me, it's really just an intro, or build-up of sorts, to the following track. Even so, it's a dark and beautifully arranged acoustic track, with that sense of power you come to expect from an epic Priest track. Also, listen to the lyrics, and you'll notice some references to earlier albums and material. <br /> <br />\\"And so now it comes to pass, <br />by the even tide of mass, <br />see them gather yet alas, <br />they remain still as stained class\\" <br /> <br />\\"Lochness\\" - 4/5 <br />Priest's tribute to the mythical monster of the deep. This song is over thirteen minutes long, easily Priest's longest song to date. Starts off with an ominous intro remiscent of some of their 70's material. If you like 70's Priest (like me) than great. And if not, don't worry, because it soon erupts into an immensely heavy song. It creates a slow and doomy atmosphere right away, and keeps it going al the way through the song, though intersting time signatures and rythm changes keep the song interesting. However, overly cheesy lyrics hurt it somewhat, but not enough for me to turn it off. It's a long, majestic epic song, and worth your time. <br /> <br />\\"This legend lives through centuries, <br />evoking history's memories, <br />prevailing in eternity... <br />Your secret's safe with me\\" <br /> <br />Well, to make a long story short (yeah I know, a little late for that, isn't it?), this is an excellent album, and a supreme return to form for one of metal's greatest bands. I guarantee, it will satisfy long time fans, and hook some new ones along the way. No Priest fan should be without this gem. Priest sounds fresh off of Painkiller, with no obvious differences except a bit more maturity. Get this album right away.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|All I can say is if you have ANY interest in Sci Fi at all you should order this product... the show itself was GREAT, the cast masterfull, and was a unique and interesting setting for the show... the western theme was questionable to me the first time i watched it, but within 10 minutes (literally) i was in love with the show.
B0009RJVI6|5.0|This book is intelligent, writerly, compelling and easily the most fascinating book to be published in years.<br /><br />It is both intimate and yet formal - providing a reflection of America and in particular contemporary motherhood.<br /><br />It is a revealing portrait of a woman who is witty, unsentimental and at times infuriatingly immature. But while Eva would seem to many an unlikeable character it is her capacity to observe and report on her life that sustains and propels the narrative.<br /><br />The reader is both simultaneously empathic while at the same time horrified by Eva and her revelations - and it is to Ms Shriver's credit that these two emotions can co-exist.<br /><br />The ending is dramatic and lifts the book into another level of intellectual and psychological brilliance.<br /><br />I could go on but I really cannot say any more than as an author myself I was blown away by this book - and for a writer to say that it really means something.<br /><br />Fiona Place
B000002O1Q|4.0|If you like the hard-driving, melodic rock and roll ballads from the like of Meatloaf, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, and Bonnie Tyler, the \\"Streets of Fire\\" soundtrack is a winner.  <br /> <br />I bought this CD because I caught the video from \\"Tonight is What it Means to Be Young,\\" a few months back and realized that I'd like Streets of Fire and the accompanying music.  <br /> <br />Some mediocre songs appear on the CD, but overall it evokes a time and place in the early 80's, which is a fun place to visit now ana again thanks to CD's like this one.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Anthony Minghella directs this tale based on the best-selling book about wounded Civil War soldier Inman (Jude Law) making the long, treacherous journey to his home in Cold Mountain, N.C. Along the way, he thinks of his love, Ada (Nicole Kidman), who has fought for sanity and her father's farm's survival while Inman has been gone, even with a brave young drifter named Ruby (Renee Zellweger, in an Oscar-winning performance) there to lend a hand.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|I think this set is absolutely awesome.  As wonderful as it is, I still have to say that it hacks me off just a bit to have the feature film split in half over two of the three discs.  They could have easily fit the movie on one disc and used the other disc to fit even MORE extras (yes, I think there should have been more).  I realize that lots of people will say that you lose picture quality trying to stuff it all on one disc but I looked at my copy of the original DVD release and they managed to fit it all on one disc and the picture quality is just beautiful.  Anyway, the set is great for the extras alone and I am excited that they have finally given this movie the treatment is deserves.
B00030590I|1.0|I was expecting big things from this movie and instead was seriously let down. I don't see how watching the same sequence of events 3 different times with only a slight change every time you watch it. It was repetitive and got boring extremely quickly. It would have been better off as a short film and cut it to 30 minutes instead of nearly 2 hours.

0895260131|1.0|Just like his previous works, Robert Spencer's newest book presents a narrow, skewed selection of source material on the institution of jihad.  Spencer strips Islamic belief of its rich nuance and context in order to depict the entire religion as bent on violent conquest  As in previous writings on jihad, Spencer relies heavily on the Sword Verses and the Ninth Sura of the Qur'an (which are indeed characterized by violence) as well as a patchwork of writings by particular extremist throughout the history of Islam.  But the fact is, there is substantially more to the body of scholarly deliberation on the meanings of jihad and its varied applications in daily life. <br /> <br />Those seeking a more balanced survey of jihad ideology should turn to the works of Rudolph Peters.  Readers looking for historical perspective on jiahd and its evolution would be better off reading Gilles Kepel.  Both are accomplished scholars who offer well-informed insights into the subject. <br /> <br />But Spencer is an ideologue--that much is unambiguous.  His scholarly background is unimpressive by most accounts and he was a little-known Christian/Conservative columnist prior to September 11.  He adds little to the dialogue on very urgent and complicated issues surrounding modern Islam.  This reviewer would urge readers to treat his works with a very discerning eye.

0140432051|3.0|Some time ago I found Darwin's \\"Origin\\" in a second hand store. More than a hundred years old, except for the [presumably] original owner's name, written elegantly inside the cover with a quill, it showed no sign it had ever been opened. Possessing a pleasant 'old book' smell but having no marks, stains, or dog-eared pages, it had rested unexamined, apparently for several generations. Then I came along and -- viola! -- punctuated equilibrium.<br /><br />Darwin's writing style is engaging, his lines of thought easy to follow. He did not 'discover,' or 'invent,' \\"evolution.\\" Classical philosophers long ago discussed evolutionary ideas, St. Augustine among them. Aristotle taught that the extent to which biological forms could change was tightly restricted. Many held this view in Darwin's day, but many did not. Many believed that species had evolved from earlier forms but no one had proposed a coherent mechanism for such a theory. Lamarck's theory of evolution failed to impress most thinkers because it smacked of vitalism and couldn't describe how changes might be heritable. Where Lamarck's theory failed, Darwin's was seen as succeeding. It is apparent to this reader, however, that in critical areas, Darwin's arguments often 'beg the question' -- in their underlying metaphysical assumptions and logic and also in terms of the difficulty resolving mathematical incongruities in 'the struggle for survival by means of natural selection.'<br /><br />Problems of mathematics:<br />Several times, in the opening paragraphs of chapter 10, Darwin underscores the quantitative nature of his \\"small steps\\" gradualistic theory. Life forms are said to be \\"blended together by innumerable transitional links,\\" and, \\"so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed, be truly enormous\\" and again, that the number of transitional links \\"must have been inconceivably great.\\" Darwin takes pains in dealing with paleontological difficulties in this regard. Concessions, arguments, and paleontological problems aside, the more interesting difficulty is one of straight-forward mathematics -- these \\"innumerable . . . truly enormous . . . inconceivably great\\" number of slow and small modifications that \\"must have incessantly occurred.\\" If 50-100 billion (the most conservative of generally cited estimates, but more realistically several hundred, if not thousand billion) species of life (mostly prokaryotes, but Darwin argues that modification proceeds most rapidly in `higher', more complex forms) are to have been brought about by \\"small steps\\" in 2.5 to 4 billion years± (3.5 billion is typically cited), with most of the action happening in the last 0.54 billion (since the Cambrian/Tommotian period), the necessary modifications and even outright 'speciations' would have to occur as a continued whirlwind of evolution. We would observe modification and speciation constantly, in significant quantity, even daily. We certainly do not observe this. Here is perhaps the most easily stated and understood of Darwinian gradualism's mathematical difficulties, but it is not the only one, nor is it seen as being the most intractable.<br /><br />Problems of logic:<br />In chapter six Darwin argues, \\"It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope. We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man?\\" The problem here is that Darwin himself proceeds to enlist repeated (metaphysical) assumptions about how the Creator would and would not work. Let us concede, with Darwin, that such thinking is presumptuous, and Darwin is repeatedly caught in his own trap.<br />Another problem of logic: Darwin writes, \\"If it could be shown that any complex organ existed, which could notpossibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case.\\" Of course no one could -- how does one observe \\"any\\" possible complex organ \\"not possibly\\" being formed? In case you think Darwin is suggesting that his theory of gradualism might be falsifiable, look again. He has actually hedged his argument behind the thorny logic of 'proving a negative.' In fact, Darwin argues, \\"we must suppose\\" that nothing could present such a \\"break down\\" case! Theories that can't be falsified aren't typically held to be scientific. Yet not only has Darwinian theory gained wide assent, it has come to be protected by law in certain quarters; the only scientific theory, so far as I know, to ever be so protected (unless one counts the Vatican's Earth-centered universe theory, per Ptolemy, in Galileo's day!). Kepler's and Newton's theories did not appeal to enforcement by jurisprudent mind-police, neither did Einstein's or Planck's.<br />Darwin frequently argues that if we presume his theory is true, and disregard countermanding evidence, then we have \\"no difficulty\\" in finding his theory to be true: \\"In all cases positive paleontological evidence may be implicitly trusted; negative evidence is worthless, as experience has so often shown\\" (chap. 10). This kind of argument could be employed to \\"find\\" any theory to be \\"true.\\"<br /><br />Metaphysical problems:<br />Darwin's \\"long argument\\" is, as he freely admits, a line of reasoning more than a body of extant evidence. In argument Darwin references his theory, over and again, to an arbitrary metaphysical demand. He says that the absolute fixity of all forms is integral to the idea of 'creation', i.e., that 'creation' must be rigidly static -- \\"special\\" creation, as he defines it. This is, of course, a very useful demand. With the language sufficiently colonized (as a prescribed condition), all evidence of variation is then automatically evidence against \\"creation\\" and supportive exclusively of his theory, and this appeal is made repeatedly. The problem is that the idea of divine creation does not demand the absolute fixity of forms. Early in the fifth century, Augustine contemplated the possibility of forms evolving, he seemed not particularly impressed with the impact of such an idea upon the principle of divine creation. In fact ideas about 'creation' [in most instances better described as 'intelligent design'] are present from early Ionic philosophy, see, for example, Anaxagoras (500-428 BC) and Aristotle (384-322 BC), and earlier, if but vaguely, Heraclitus (535-475 BC), who affirmed both an essential \\"Logos\\" (design) and material change (evolution).<br /><br />Some evolutionary biologists (e.g. cell biologist Lynn Margulis) doubt that the natural selection \\"battle\\" can adequately explain variation. Natural selection states: if a gene z is more likely to succeed (reproductively) than a gene y, then gene z is more likely to succeed than gene y. Is this an explanation or a tautology? It makes a statement that z has been whittled from [yz], but what does it tell us about the existence of [yz] except that it, in turn, had been whittled from [xyz], for example. It states a subtractive process by which a genetic set can be modified. But does it tell us anything about how or why modifiable sets exist? Even if we accept Darwin's arguments for natural selection acting on random variation as an adequate mechanism for all variation (and doubt seems reasonable), it remains that the very existence of such things as complex cellular and genetic material (proteins, enzymes, DNA) remains unexplained. To be selected, something must exist.<br />In citing problems with Darwin's arguments, I do not dismiss all his ideas. But his \\"struggle\\" arguments don't have the broad explanatory qualities that he believed them to have. Whether in 1859 or today, his theory is obviously incompatible with certain ideas about 'special creation', but as Darwin admits, it hardly undermines the final implication of an extant Creator. Philosopher Garth Hallett, who appears to have no difficulty with Darwinian theory, says, \\"What in Hume's day looked like products of intelligent design now look like the results of natural evolution, but natural evolution itself -- from big bang to life, sentient beings, and Homo sapiens -- now looks like the product of supremely intelligent design. To construct whole villages from Tinkertoys would be clever; to construct Tinkertoys that form the villages on their own would be prodigious. How prodigious the unfolding of the universe has been, we have only recently begun to glimpse.\\"<br /><br />Darwin appears to have been a rather pleasant gentleman, frequently praising others, conspicuously including his detractors (a wise tactic perhaps). He was intelligent, wrestled with very difficult questions, and tentatively believed he had discovered the best answer possible. Many still do (e.g. zoologist Richard Dawkins). As for contemporary scientists who doubt, in one way or another, that he did propose an adequate mechanism, and there are more than you may have been led to believe, I recommend the critiques of: philosopher of science David Stove, mathematical geneticists Hubert Yockey and/or Lee Spetner; mathematician M.P. Schutzenberger, biochemists Michael Denton, or Dean Kenyon, and quantum chemist Henry Schaefer III (maybe not the names you were expecting?). Some Darwinians love to hate these guys, but they are respected scientists, they don't reject Darwin 'wholesale', most of them (the above mentioned, that is) are avowed agnostics, Yockey is likely the most eminent scientist in his field, and Schaeffer has been nominated for a Nobel Prize at least five times. They've published many peer-reviewed papers (this matters inordinately to some folks!). Darwin has become a polemists icon, if not poster child, but many people [probably most] cling strongly to opinions of his work that, whether for or against, are too extreme.<br />© wes janssen 2005s theory, and this appeal is made repeatedly.

B000A3DFZE|5.0|So Eric has recently played with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, <br />some old friends named Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker and recently <br />released two great blues albums.  Still there are those who want <br />the same kind of music over and over again.  That's why there <br />are bands like AC/DC...for so called music fans that are stuck <br />in a time warp, probably still sporting a mullet.  Try something <br />new or write music that differs from the past or your last effort and suddenly you get bad reviews.  When an artist has <br />such a catalog as Clapton has you tend to want to judge his new <br />stuff against his past accomplishments.  I mean if you want to  <br />dog an artist because he isn't doing what you want him or think <br />he should be doing then you should not write a review.  And of <br />all the negative reviews how many play guitar or have ever sat <br />down and wrote a song.  This is Eric Clapton's latest.  Is it <br />a great album? Who am I to say.  Time will tell, but as a fan <br />from the Yardbirds days on, I enjoy it all.  Including this new <br />disc. If you are a real fan of music and or Clapton I would  <br />buy this album.

B000ANVQ0K|4.0|When Titanic was released in December of 1997, most people predicted the film would sink like its real life namesake. People went to see the movie, not once or twice or even three times, but a half a dozen or more. Theaters were packed to the gills on all screenings and the movie ceased being just a movie and became a phenomenon. Titanic mania was everywhere, from books to the soundtrack which spent an amazing 18 weeks at number and you couldn't turn on a radio and not hear Celine Dion's omnipresent \\"My Heart Will Go On\\". Leonardo DiCaprio became a teen idol and Kate Winslet became a star. Oh yeah, James Cameron made pretty enjoyable and good film. Known for his use of special effects, Titanic boasts some stunning visuals. The detailed recreation of the doomed ship is stunning. The sinking of the ship is terrifying and breathtaking. Amid all these effects is a classic Hollywood love story. Mr. DiCaprio's Jack is a rogue who wins his way into the third class steerage section in a card game while Ms. Winslet's Rose is from a family of means and travels in the first class section with her money hungry mother (played by Francis Fisher) and her loathsome fianc&eacute;e Cal (played with an evil sneer by Billy Zane). Jack and Rose meet on deck and quickly fall in love. They are meant for another, but their love is doomed from the start. The tragic ending to their relationship will leave you misty-eyed. While the movie definitely pulls on your heartstrings, the two leads are so believable and charming you can't help but be drawn in. Titanic went on to become the highest grossing movie in history and tied Ben-Hur with a record 11 Academy Awards (which was tied by The Return Of The King as well).  The deluxe edition is long overdue for a film of this magnitude.  The three dvd's are packaged in a handsome case and is loaded with extras including deleted scenes, commentary, and other features.
B0007VCZ50|5.0|I purchased the \\"soundtrack\\" to this when CDs first came out in the 80s... now finally I have the DVD and am able to watch this great movie... It is the story of how a band and album are created... The performances are great... the documentary is great... Definite re-playability... Plus it has been mixed in 5.1 and also has some bonus videos... If you have listened to the CD, buy the DVD!
B000B2YQX4|3.0|The pluses on the new Depeche Mode are obvious:  more energy (not to be confused with speed), solid songs, Dave Gahan's continuous improvement as a lead singer.  There are at least four ace DM tracks here:  Suffer Well, The Sinner in Me, Precious, Lilian.  The minuses are that each of these tracks have antecedents in their previous work, and the new stuff isn't so much an improvement as a restatement.  So once you acclimate yourself to the new tunes, the question becomes:  will you be Playing the Angel, or would you rather here Black Celebration or Violator?
0807262013|5.0|An absolutely delight.  There should be an award category for those who \\"act/read\\"  books on tape/cd, and the cast of The Amber Spyglass should receive the \\"Oscar.\\"  The cast is top notch; the treatment of the material sensitive and thought provoking.  When I read the book, I was not as aware of the choices Mrs. Coulter made and the enormity of the repercusions, but listening to her brought a new dimension to the pain and love she experienced.  I had read The Dark Materials triology a few years ago, so knew the story, but as Pullman narrated, I found myself as spellbound as a young child listening to a bedtime story. I cannot praise the third book's rendering without emphasizing that it only continued with it's excellence, what the first two books began.  A most worthwhile purchase.  Like any wonderful piece of art, one visit is not enough.
0790729369|3.0|I like this movie.  To be honest, I think the book is much better.  I'm not a huge fan of Clint Eastwood in this role but Meryl Streep easily makes up difference.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was recommend to us as a great series.  When we saw the whole year on sale at a great price, we purchased it.  Firefly didn't disappoint and when we saw the movie \\"Serenity\\", now we can't wait for it to come out on DVD! <br />It is dissapointing that the FOX network didn't take this show more seriously when it first aired.  According to the DVD, the shows were aired all out of order.  BUT then who takes us SCI-FI fans seriously?   <br />If you are a SCI-FI/Western fan, you will love Firefly and Serenity!!! <br />
B000008IAI|5.0|This album is perhaps one of the best live rock albums of all time, capturing McCartney at his best.  Two discs contain stellar material from start to finish, including some gems from the Beatle era, and even Denny Lane singing on the Moody Blues' hit \\"Go Now.\\"  The highlight of the album, though, is probably \\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\\" by all accounts a performance that eclipses the studio version.
6304711905|5.0|One of the most unforgettable portraits of the cool gunslinger, Doc Holiday.  The performance of Val Kilmer's is one from which all others will be judged....just outstanding.  Dennis Quaid came close in his performance of Doc Holiday in the movie Wyatt Earp, but Val Kilmer's Doc Holiday is just tops and is the best reason to see this movie.
B00003CXFV|5.0|What makes Julia Roberts' Oscar winning performance as Erin Brockovich so meaningful is that unlike fellow winners Charlize Theron (Monster); Nicole Kidman (The Hours); and Halle Berry (Monster's Ball), Roberts didn't hide behind makeup or non-glamor to win her trophy.  She utilizes her physical attributes and then some in playing the scrappy, but somewhat tawdry, young woman who brings down a corporate giant.  Roberts is brilliant in the role and shows a wider range than ever before.  She is backed by a wonderful supporting cast including the marvelous Albert Finney as her lawyer boss and friend; Aaron Eckhart as the biker boyfriend who feels cheated in the relationship; Marg Helgenberger as the cancer-stricken client that starts the ball rolling; and Conchata Ferrell as the \\"krispy kreme\\" office worker who she spars with.  Director Stephen Soderbergh (an Oscar winner for TRAFFIC) wisely keeps the focus on Brockovich's determination and her single motherhood dilemma.  It's a very entertaining, and thought-provoking, movie, a showcase for one of Hollywood's modern icons.
B00003CXFV|4.0|This is a great story which has been wrapped in an entertaining sub-story and well acted by all.  This is Julia's best work in my opinion.  Albert Finney is always a favorite and his role here is absolutely charming.  I would highly recommend this film.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This album is so much better than Take off you Pants and Jacket. For one its got All the Small Things on it - one of the best Blink songs ever. Secondly, its got Adam's song on it. I'm not getting involved in the arguement about it but I will say that its a great song that means a lot to a lot of people, if you think its emo rubbish then thats fine (but some people LIKE emo rubbish!) Anyway if you're going to but one Blink CD then buy this one, even if the cover does give you nightmares....
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This movie is surely not worth the money and energy and talent put into it or the time it takes to watch it. No one in this film has a moral center. The whole story gives us nothing but dis-connection in human relationships, ends the same. No one loves anyone. Dispiriting viewing. The fact that this film was Oscar-involved seems to comment on something in the culture of L.A. which has lost its soul. Academy Award voters are either too-driven by a sticky pull toward the individual who is stunned or twisted by fate -- or inundated by nihilism. This one makes me long for the films which actually illuminated our inner disconnection or existential nihilism and nudged us therefore toward doing something about it -- like Bunuel, Antonioni, Bergman. This one is no them, not by a long shot. <br />   [What's with Clive Owen? I loved him in the TV series, Second Sight, but keep searching to find the parts of him (edgy, angry, frightened, authoritative, caring) I loved in his subsequent roles -- and can't.]  <br />    [Mike Nichols made a wonderful Angels In America (HBO-TV) but , with this offering, makes me wonder if there is something missing in him. His direction of individuals is good but some connections between people seem to be missing. Is he too cynical? That served him very, very well in his Elaine May/Mike Nichols comedy album of the fifties, as satiricynicism. But what about his choice of scripts?]
1400032717|5.0|Also lots of fun! This 1st person narrative by an eccentric 15- year old (he also counts the months and days) is definitely a unique and offbeat read, the kind I'll probably re-read sometime soon. He views four red cars together as a great thing, and four yellow cars as bad, with brown cars almost as bad. An animal lover, the book starts with the \\"curious incident of the dog\\", a famous takeoff on Sherlock Holmes with comparisons to the great (and eccentric) detective thruoghout. Who could possible have killed the large poodle, owned by the woman in the neighborhood? During moments of duress, our hero broods upon square and cube roots. Later, we find that his parents have had serious marital conflicts, and this causes some very serious, and totally normal, crises, among all concerned. The prize here is taking the special maths exam, and hopefully aceing it! But there is a lot more here, including a very strange trip to London, and a terrific journey there, and into the trains and tubes along the way. So, don't miss this one!
1932907009|5.0|I'm a journalist working on a book and picked up Blake Snyder's book on a recent trip to LA. What a kick! <br /> <br />Though I have no plans to write a screenplay, Snyder's book is helpful to any writer who wants to tell a good story, especially for people working on longer pieces. STC is full of fun details, neat tricks of the trade and screenwriting secrets. Snyder has a great way of communicating challenging storytelling concepts without resorting to trade lingo. Save The Cat is useful and inspiring.  <br /> <br />(I'll also never watch a movie the same way again.) <br /> <br />I just purchased two extra copies for young friends who are aspiring writers and I know that they will love it.
0307276902|5.0|Like many others who've read this book, I read it in 2 days. The 2nd day, I was up over the wkend til FIVE A.M. Nothing about this book shocked or appalled me. NOTHING. My family is riveted with alcoholism and drug abuse. I come from a family of total dysfunction and chaos. But, this book shows that no one is exempt from addiction, be they rich, poor, privledged or not. Addiction does not discriminate. It just IS. Everything in James Frey's book hit a nerve with me, the honesty, the rebellion, the need, the constant need to fill up the emptiness, kill the pain. As of this writing, today.. I am reminded... that, my father is in rehab for the 2nd time, he is 87 yrs. old. His alcoholism got worse over time as he aged. He's been in detox SEVEN times. He's been in the ER for minor abrasions from falling down on the street drunk and out of his mind. One time he fell down and I got a call from a woman who saw him across the street, screaming and screaming in the ground. He didn't know what he was DOING. My son is leaving his non alkie wife, they are splitting up due to his boozin ways. He chose king alcohol over his loyal and kind wife. I can only pray for him. He is miserably unhappy. Neither my dad or my son, have sought out any recovery on their own. My father was forced back into rehab by the people at his ambulatory sr. home he resides in.. or he would be evicted. The first time my dad was in rehab, he was too weak, too sick and too fuzzy to resist. This 2nd time, he wasn't 'as bad as..' the last time, and they got  him to go in there. The first time, he had been drunk for ten yrs straight almost, and he was a low bottom drunk. Since most in this review spoke of the book I am sharing my own personal experience, sorry. Hope this share does not offend anyone. But this is a good read for families of the afflicted, the addicted.. to get an idea about this thing. While James decided not to do any 12 step program, (and I feared for him in a way.. and wondered.. will he makeit, as i read along), I believe recovery needs structure and those like themselves to fortify and the fellowship to get and stay well. I would tend to think it would be very very hard for anyone to be sober amidst all there is out there, waiting... waiting.. to test them again. But sometimes? when a bottom is this low, this bad.. one has only one way to go, and that is UP. Maybe for James Frey such was the case. I believe his very suffering was ENOUGH to say ENOUGH. And that youth was on his side, while for others, it may not be, as when we are young, we feel and deem life to be 'bullet proof' and test those old waters again... and again. I loved LOVED this book. I loved every raw, painful difficult aspect of this read, I saw my father go through almost as much, and I could write a book about THAT. I am unshockable. A rough life has made me this way. A rough childhood and my own bad choices in men, made me this way. I had no example with my dad, but today I have forgiven him. I HAD to. For anyone who is in great pain over a family member's addiction and who remains embittered, angry, and rage filled, maybe this book will show them, that family and the addicted are both in pain. Today I love my father. I used to hate him for years. I love him because he needs to be loved. And I do not need to hate him, but hate what he does to HIMSELF. This book aint meant for sissies.. if you're offended by four letter words, (I am not), and the rough side of addiction, of life, of consequences that lead to crime, then no.. this book isn't for you. But if you can look at all walks of life, good bad or indifferent, study this in terms of, another human beings story then, its a great read. I am going to watch James Frey on Oprah this afternoon. I have been looking forward to this since last wk. And, I feel his book may help many a lost soul, in some way, to try to try, to begin anew, to surrender the madness, the life threatening insanity of addiction that destroys them and everyoneelse in it's wake.
B0002858YS|3.0|I did like this cd, and it certainly does have its good points. The first 2 songs, Mr. Brightside and Jenny was a Friend of mine are amazing and leave you expecting more. Unfortunatly though I think that after this great start the album loses it a bit. The songs start to sound the same and this is not a CD you can listen to again and again and again. Indie Rock and Roll is really bad- it grates on me and I have to skip it (if I get that far into the album before finding something more interesting to listen to). I reckon you'd be better of downloading the two aforementioned tracks (And maybe Somebody Told Me) and giving the rest a miss.
B0002EXH4A|3.0|time fer my 2 cents . i love megadeth. they're the 2nd thrash band i ever heard. i bought everything they recorded on cassette soon after they were released(up until \\"countdown...\\"). i went to see them live. i had megadeth posters & t shirts. i would even try to draw Vic Rattlehead. so its safe to say i'm a fan. <br /> <br />this remastered version of \\"so far....\\" is so bad. i guess Dave did'nt realize what a classic it was,or maybe he just did'nt care. you don't mess w/the classics. its like adding your own touches to an antique painting .no no no no no no ,you have it professionaly cleaned ! i guess one could say \\"well Dave made it, he could change it if he wants to\\" .well he was'nt the only one who made it.they shoul've called it \\"so far so good..\\"(as Dave Mustaine entended).these songs are remixed ,not just remastered & Dave HAS turned the volume up on hisself.i heard the other reissuse of their stuff were the same way. <br /> <br />well tou got me this time Dave. maybe you can do it again the right way & sell a bunch more albums'
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is amazing, and everyone should watch it. Even if you didn't like Buffy or Angel (aka you are crazy) you'll like this. It's funny and very clever. It never should have been cancelled.
B000002LTU|5.0|If you are a classic jazz aficionado this album is probably not for you, that is unless you've got an open mind. This album was way ahead of its time. Obviously a direct influence on Guru's Jazzamatazz series. The disc is an unbelievable blend of jazz, funk and hip hop. I suppose this album sort've reaches \\"cult favorite status\\". Toss this on at any occasion, whether it be in the car, at a party or at dinner, any decent fan of music will recognize the originality of this cd. I am 19. My Dad is turning 50 in a week. I'll say that we both groove to this disc equally hard.
0446577383|5.0|I'm a relatively new Baldacci fan having only read Last Man Standing.  Because of that inexperience its a difficult stretch for me to say that The Camel Club is typical Baldacci, but that's what I'm going to say.  Fast paced, well thought out plot, great story setting, memorable and believable characters, wonderful scenes and terrific dialog all work together to make The Camel Club a great read.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer when he opines that in a hundred years no one will probably remember The Camel Club.  But then who knows?<br /><br />The plot is simple....a group of conspiracy nuts, The Camel Club, witness a murder.  Bent on the idea that this was a government hit they begin an unofficial and informal investigation.  And the story goes on......<br /><br />I found this to be a page turner difficult to put down.  Highly recommended.
B0000062GK|3.0|After recording his most stripped back and least pyrotechnic record of his career, Joe Satriani yet again switched gears-- \\"Crystal Planet\\" sounds to be an attempt at capturing the energy of a live show on record-- with longtime partners bassist Stuart Hamm and drummer Jeff Campitelli along with progammer Eric Caudieux forming the core of the band, the album is in many ways the exact opposite of its predecessor (\\"Joe Satriani\\")-- explosive, fiery, brimming with energy.  But more often than not, it seems to be lacking in something-- my suspicion is that studio environments have a tendency to tighten up musicians, which results in the energy from the live sound that this album seems to be going for to be somewhat lacking. <br /> <br />Still, there's a bunch of really nice material on here-- the title track has a galloping rhythm, a frantic gutiar solo, and by and large is a superb performance, \\"Love Thing\\" finds Satriani at his most lyrical, and \\"Ceremony\\" features a driving rhythm and a superbly restrained performance from Satriani.  And certainly both \\"A Piece of Liquid\\" and \\"Psycho Monkey\\" find Satriani at his most exploratory, and by and large point the way for this album's followup. <br /> <br />But for each standout, there's another track that feels a bit too much like \\"The Extremist\\" for me (\\"Up in the Sky\\") or is just pretty much unmemorable (\\"With Jupiter in Mind\\").  I'm really by and large of the opinion that, like \\"Flying in a Blue Dream\\", this album would have benefited from some editing (it's 67 minutes long).  It's a decent enough album to make it worth investigating, but Satch's done much better.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I didn't watch this show during it's television run, but a friend of mine highly recommended it.  Then I saw Serenity was going to the big screen so I bought the DVD collection.  The pilot episode was great!  Then it took me a few more episodes to warm up to all the characters as they are gradually exposed.  By the time I finished disc one, I was in.  Buy the time I finished the collection, I was consumed.  I wanted more but there isn't any.  I havn't seen the movie but I hope it's great!  If you like Sci-Fi, can dig a western and like things that are different, then definately give this show a try.  The effects are excellent, the stories are stellar and it's vision of our future is more human that any other sci-fi series.  Plus too, all the female cast members are hot, I can't decide which one I'm more infatuated with.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Oldboy is awesome. Think of it as Korean Pulp Fiction. Stylized violence (you will never think of a hammer and dentistry the same again), awesome cinematography and a plot with plenty of well thought out twists. I watched it once from Netflix and immediatley made this purchase here! <br /> <br />Enjoy <br />
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|this movie angered me. if leo dicaprio were under thesse cirmcumstances he'd surely be in a corner shaking like a little terrified girl. am i the only one thinking the directors should have cast a more masculine protagonist, cauly mccaulkin perhaps?

But c'mon! she seriously lack the personality and confidence as a person who works for marketing!! <br /> <br />Jack, well, the plot didn't convience about his affection towards Emma.  Somehow, I find him as a sexual predator!!!!  seriously, don't we all have heard enough about sexual harassment at work!?   <br /> <br />I would recommend all of the shopaholic series or even the undomestic goddess, but not this one
B000B5IPLK|1.0|What a pain! I tried to put all the tracks in itunes and the first 7 tracks were fine but then the rest playback horribly. I had no idea that the copy protection would do this to a cd I BOUGHT. Now my only choice is to download this in a non-legal way. On a side note Alicia did a great job on the music. :)

B00079FUI6|3.0|The episodes themselves are obviously good - however the DVD quality is quite bad. There's glitches here and there. No, I didn't drop the DVDs or do anything bad with them. I just popped the videos in, and the DVDs stop in Disc 3 and Disc 4. After a few seconds of skipping to the next chapter, it works again.
0307276902|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who is tired of reading one so-so book after another.  This book grabs you from the first sentence and doesn't let you go until the last.  I read it in 3 days and have recommended it to everyone I have talked to.  It will change any misconception you have about addiction, detox, and rehab because this book shares every gory detail.  Thank you, James Frey, for writing such a superior work of art!

B00009OYER|5.0|Spectacular film.  Wonderful direction, tight script, and inspired acting (if occasional spurts going over the top by Brody.)  By far, the best presentation of the film is the Canadian 3 Disc Limited Edition.  In addition to the added extras, the transfer seems much crisper than than the American 2 Disc.   <br /> <br />How unfortunate that director Roman Polanski's sexual legal problems have deprived American cinema of such a talent.
0679736646|5.0|Anti-precogs have just upped and vanished from the face of the Earth and the corporation they work for, Runciter's Associates - a psychic security firm - does not know where they have gone. Glen Runciter, the boss who is losing workers, consults his dead wife in cryo-stasis at the Swiss Beloved Brethren Moratorium to see if she can use her telepathic abilities to help them. Runciter suspects that precogs have infiltrated their world by the hand of a competitive corporate business and so assembles a group of anti-precogs for a lunar trip to scan a commercial enterprise for a possible enemy, only for Runciter to end up violently murdered. On their way back to Earth to put Runciter into cryo-stasis Anti-precog Joe Chip, who has now taken charge of the group, notices that their reality may have shifted during the murder as new food appears spoiled and other items have aged. One by one the assembly of anti-precogs must discover what is happening to them, why they are digressing in time and yet aging, why some of them are disappearing, why Runciter is trying to contact them from beyond the grave, which of the anti-precogs may be a competitor trying to control their fate, and what is this \\"meaning of life in can\\" called UBIK all about? Chip starts to receive data voice messages from the past and the future that belong to his dead boss prompting him to penetrate the mystery further as the team members vanish or are murdered. Is it possible that Joe Chip may be dead? Are they are in half-life suspended animation? Is this a big dream or a computer controlled virtual reality?<br /><br />Ubik is one of Dick's more upbeat books, reading more like a high paced action movie than some of his deeper more psychological stories. Instead of creating too many internal questions there is lots of dialogue and a quickly changing environment from apartment rooms, to office blocks, the moon and the virtual world. At the start of every chapter Dick has an interesting anecdote that does not make sense until we are introduced to what this mysterious Ubik actually is. It is also interesting to note that the science term `half-life' is used here to express a virtual world that become an exceptional computer game in our own reality.<br /><br />Written as a satirical metaphysical comedy Philip K. Dick's delivers on a highly heady tale of anti-precogs in alternative realities predicting the future by manipulating the past in a suspenseful light hearted detective mystery tale that is the perfect intoxicating mind stimulation that the reader seeking original creative science-fiction writing needs. UBIK is the UBIK we search for in our lives, tales that keep us going, beautifully crafted - a theory of life within a theory of life - the endless possibilities of UBIK make it an instant science-fiction classic by the master of science-fiction. A superb follow-up the year after his other masterpiece \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" (Blade Runner) was released.<br /><br />Read more of Philip K. Dick by starting with \\"Do Androids Dream\\" then try his early Hugo awaring winning book \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" and then this one.

076781326X|5.0|OLIVER! (1968) is director Sir Carol Reed's Oscar-winning film of Lionel Bart's smash London and New York stage musical, which in turn is based on Charles Dickens' novel.  I think Dickens  would recognize his story here, despite 14 Bart songs.  An orphan named Oliver Twist (newcomer Mark Lester) falls in with a gang of pickpockets led by Fagin (spectacular Ron Moody) in the London underworld.  Oliver's age, the Artful Dodger (Oscar nominee Jack Wild) shows Oliver how it is done.  But a case of mistaken identity in crowded Covent Garden leads Oliver to have a new home in beautiful Bloomsbury.  INTERMISSION.<br /><br />Part two of OLIVER! has the terrifying criminal Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and his likeable girlfriend Nancy (sensational Shani Wallis) on the trail of Oliver, kidnapping him back to Fagin's den to find out what he has told his rich benefactor.  Bill is so brutal that Nancy sides with Oliver, leading to a bleak plot development and eventually to a double happy ending.<br /><br />The songs in this dazzling Broadway musical are magnificent and have the vocal talents to do them justice:  The fabulous \\"Who Will Buy?\\" as a part two showstopper; Shani Wallis' exuberant \\"Oom-Pah-Pah\\" at the end; Ron Moody's \\"Pick a Pocket or Two\\" and \\"Be Back Soon\\"; \\"Consider Yourself\\" and \\"I'd Do Anything\\".  Choreographer Onna White, who did THE MUSIC MAN six years earlier, earned a Special Oscar here.  The movie runs 153 minutes with roadshow and Intermission music restored, so it is probably the entire stage production.<br /><br />No one seems as well treated by filmmakers as Charles Dickens, from Selznick's towering DAVID COPPERFIELD and A TALE OF TWO CITIES (both 1935 MGM), to David Lean's GREAT EXPECTATIONS (1946, British) and OLIVER TWIST (1948, British), to everyone from Alistair Sim to the Muppets doing A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  Carol Reed's fabulous musical remake does not quite top Lean's non-musical OLIVER TWIST, but it is awfully good.  Oswald Morris gives the movie a B&Wcolor look in Panavision, and John Box's Oscar-winning sets are a marvel-bridges over rivers leading one way to Fagin's den and the other way to a downtown tavern, plus the crescent row of Bloomsbury mansions and parks that are the setting for the miraculous \\"Who Will Buy?\\"<br /><br />The cast could not be better, especially Oscar nominee Ron Moody as a cunning Fagin, Oliver Reed as a chilling and brutal Bill Sykes, and a luminous Shani Wallis who brings the whole tavern to life with her exhilarating \\"Oom-Pah-Pah\\" as Nancy.  Newcomer Mark Lester as Oliver and young Jack Wild (another deserved Oscar nominee) as the Artful Dodger are very good.  Yet the grim and gripping Dickens story is not lost amid a whopping fourteen songs.  Everyone here does right by Dickens' complex and frightening plot; he would probably love the imaginative production.  This is one Best Picture and Director Oscar winner that really deserves to win Best Picture and Director, and four other awards.

A couple of weeks earlier I was given 48 hours to live, then my bleeding stopped as mysteriously as it had started. However, I went home with some very high restrictions on my diet and activity. <br /> <br />Prior to entering the hospital, I was a very active teen and very popular in school. Afterwards, I found myself unable to participate in the activities and routine of which I was accustomed. I became withdrawn and lost almost all my friends. There were even times, standing on my parents balcony, when I would consider jumping and ending it all. <br /> <br />That winter we spent the Christmas holidays with my uncle in Vermont. I woke up early from my uncle's sofa on Christmas morning and happened to spy a book \\"Your Erroneous Zones\\" under the tree, which was apparently given as a Christmas gift to my aunt. After reading the introduction and first chapter of this book, I felt hope in my life for the first time since my illness.  <br /> <br />When I returned home I bought the book and it changed my live. I am now 45 years old and have never looked back. Life has had its challenges, but Dr. Dyer's advice has always been there to get me through. If you really want to take charge of your life, and be happy no matter what then this book is for you! <br /> <br />
0451191153|5.0|Like Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead is one of the finest peices of literature ever written. This book emphasizes the importance of individualism over collectivism, and of sticking to principals. Howard Roark, the hero (arguably modeled on Frank Loyd Wright), is a hard working architect who learns not to compromise with his ideas on architecture. He doesn't believe in designing with architectural styles of the past - Classical, Gothic, Rennasaince - and instead uses a new modern style that hasn't been done before, using new concepts and new technology to create unique buildings. <br /> <br />Although he is a brilliant architect, he refuses to build anything in a historical style, resulting in his expulsion from his college, and later making it difficult for him to get any contracts. Even when faced with closing his business, he still refuses to do work he doesn't believe in.  <br /> <br />Peter Keating, on the other hand, is a talented architect who at first becomes wealthy and famous designing buildings in historical styles. He quickly rises to becoming a partener in a great architectural firm, and designs many buildings that are praised by the public. However, he has no talent for designing anything new, and often has to ask for help from Howard Roark. Much of the story revolves around the conflict between the two - Roark would rather create a magnificent builing, but Keating would rather get credit for creating a magnificent building that he didn't design. <br /> <br />The story takes twist with the involvement of Elsworth Toohey, an architecture critic who preaches altruism, and despises any form of sucess, like the buildings of Roark. Dominque Francon, a manipulative woman, gets involved with both Roark and Keating. And Gail Wynand, a very wealthy an powerful man with no principals, becomes great friends with Roark, although eventually he will learn why his lack of principals will ultimately be his demise.  <br /> <br />Hoard Roark constantly struggles againstthe general population, who view him negatively for being selfish and stubborn. He goes through expulsions, bankruptcies, betrayals, but because of his determination he eventually ends up on top - above Keating, Wynand, and Toohey.  <br /> <br />The great thing about The Fountainhead is that it still applies to modern life, as individualism and principals are just as important. For instance, John Kerry, like Peter Keating, based his policies on what the public thought was good, and not what he felt was good. And like Peter Keating, John Kerry ended up as someone who will never be on top, and who will soon be forgotten (I'll remove this review if he somehow does get elected in 2008). On a more positive note, many people throughout history, like Susan B. Anthony and Martin Luther King, had strict principals on what was right, and they did not compromise with their principals, which is why we achieved gender and racial equality.  The Fountainhead will continue to be a commonly read book, and the principals of it will continue to be true.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Upon getting this CD in your hand and opening the creatively cut and folded box you get the feeling you're in for quite another journey. Vitalogy was their first album experimenting with different box art and it was done very well. It fully captured the feel of the album and this one is no different. No Code gives you lyrics on the back of collectable mock polaroid photos inside a little sleeve. Throughout the art of No Code you see a variety of pictures, some gruesome and others slightly disturbing but they all cover a wide range of either cultures or groups of people. This is the album that Pearl Jam went in a variety of different directions. While doing this PJ lost most of their casual fans but only reaffirmed thier hardcore fans belief that they're one of the best bands. <br /> <br />'Sometimes' opens the album up slowly while building up near the end. It's probably my least favorite song on the album but it works as an opener to show you what direction they are going in. Hail Hail is one of the more upbeat songs and has some of my favorite lyrics like \\"are you woman enough to be my man?...bandaged hand in hand\\". Songs like In My Tree and Who You Are certainly can be described as experimental be it the clapping or the interesting drumming. It should be said that No Code probably wouldn't have happened like this without Jack Irons on the drums. The experimentation will probably take some time for people to get used to but rest assured it will come with time. <br /> <br />This album has worked it's way up my charts of favorite albums(and favorite PJ albums) with songs as strong as Smile(upbeat with beautiful solos), Off He Goes(slower paced and powerful lyrics), Red Mosquito(in the vein of Smile with another great solo) and possibly their best slow song Present Tense. I've used Present Tense in a small little video I made for Hurricane Katrina relief and it fit beautifully with the lyrics and overall mood of the song. If anyone has given up on this album or are tempted to I ask you to keep giving it listens. Eddie Vedder excels at writing lyrics that fit critical points in our lives and it especially rings true on No Code. <br /> <br />If you want evidence listen to I'm Open. It's not really a song so much as a story. Ed does a great voiceover fit for any storyteller as he talks about when a child becomes an adult and the magic of childhood disappears. It gave me chills to listen to it and when you listen to the lyrics in pretty much all of these songs you can get the same effect.  <br /> <br />While No Code is a softer album than their others it's still just as amazing. There's still the hard rockers like Habit, Lukin, or Hail Hail but Pearl Jam really matured with No Code. It was certainly for the best and necessary to stand the test of time. If you've been getting Pearl Jam albums I definately suggest to not stop and get this. New fans of PJ I'll give you the same advice I was given. Start with Ten and feel the growth of the band all the way to Riot Act.
B000641ZA4|4.0|First, I agree with most on here about the quality of the picture and sound of this disc.  It is almost perfect, if you are a fan of Genesis after Peter Gabriel left.  It includes all the videos they did with Phil Collins as leader, as well as three videos from Ray Wilson, and the remake of Carpet Crawlers featuring Peter Gabriel and Phil sharing the lead.  However, this is where the package falls short for me.  The videos for Home By The Sea/Second Home By The Sea and Man On The Corner were originally from live concert videos.  But the original audio has been replaced with a remaster of the original STUDIO versions of the song.  Now, the studio versions are great, but I was hoping to get the live mixes.  Sadly, those are gone, until Genesis decides to rerelease those original concert videos (Three Sides Live, The Mama Tour, etc.).  Also, the audio mix is different for Land Of Confusion (removing much of the sfx and dialoge except for the beginning and end).  Other than that, this is a great anthology of the best Genesis had to offer in the studio after Gabriel's exit.
B0007P3582|2.0|i liked get rich or die trying- it had some great beats and i could listen all the way through it without skipping a track and the guest vocals from eminem are good and g unit are ok,although this album is a lot worse and i think it is a bit half as*ed and there are no really memorable tracks on here, i still think there are a few alright tracks on here, and you can't base how you feel about a whole album on only hearing a few tracks. p.s haha trevor your review didn't get showed you forgot to blank out c**p.
1559409010|5.0|<br />I'll be honest, I didn't see how \\"the boys\\" could get any funnier than \\"...Search for the Holy Grail\\", but THEY HAVE. <br /> <br />Graham Chapman reaches amazing comedic heights as \\"Brian\\" the mistaken Messiah. The entire fim has a coherent plot (with one 2-minute exception that seems prophetic of some Gilliam films) and completely harpoons every Biblical epic in a way that filmakers today wouldn't dream of trying - but in very good taste. <br /> <br />Except for the full frontal nudity of both sexes. <br /> <br />The other Pythons are also brillant in their own right, swapping out character after character in their classic style. Shockingly, Terry Gilliam is actually present on the screen for a pretty substansial amount of time, showing off his own performing talent long hidden behind the animator's desk. Coincidentally, the film has only one animated scene - the credits. <br /> <br />However, for all fellow Christians out there, compared with many \\"South Park\\" episodes, the entire religous aspect of Christ and such is given much respect. The first opening scene is one of Jesus preaching to the masses in honest, respective biblical text and chaos ensues from a few \\"Pythonites\\" in the back who can't hear what He's saying. Also, Brian never tries to \\"be\\" the Messiah, rather he spends half the movie trying to convince an idiotic, over-zealous horde to leave him the \\"bloody hell alone\\".  <br /> <br />I suppose this film received a bad rap in the seventies and eighties, but it's really all right for adults - just close your eyes when you see a bare-bottomed Graham Chapman heading for a window (if you don't like that sort of thing...) and beware because there is a good bit of cursing througout. So see it once and \\"decide for youselves\\" and if you like it, great. If you don't, at least you can argue intelligently with those of us who do. Also, the closing scene of \\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\" is worth sitting through the whole movie for. <br /> <br />Finally, as a reference point to all the other Python films, <br /> <br />Magnanimously more storylined than \\"And Now For Something...\\" <br />Even more historical references than \\"...The Holy Grail...\\" <br />Nowhere near as disgusting as Mr.Creosote from \\"...The Meaning of Life.\\" <br /> <br />P.S. \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is NOT bullocks and this film is NOWHERE near replacement for it...though you'd probably have a more...entertaining evening watching \\"Monty Python's Life of Brian\\".  <br /> <br />I think even Mel Gibson would attest to that
B000B5UL7G|5.0|Poor Robert Peter Williams - more than twenty UK hits under his belt, but still a mere blip on the US radar.  Always the underdog, he was voted \\"Take That\\" member least likely to succeed, and dismissed by Noel Gallagher of Oasis as \\"That fat dancer from Take That\\".<br /><br />Having resurrected his career with the 1997 mega-ballad \\"Angels\\", the tattooed bad boy took off from there with hit after hit, despite being largely ignored on the music charts between Canada and Mexico.  Although a US resident, Robbie didn't intend to release this album stateside even though it was recorded in LA, but eager fans started grabbing the album from iTunes as soon as it was released in that format.<br /><br />Firing his opening shot with \\"Tripping\\", a reggae-backed song reminiscent of \\"Dreadlock Holiday\\" by 10CC and \\"Overkill\\" by Men at Work, he follows up with the sweet ballad \\"Advertising Space\\".<br /><br />A sample of the lyrics from \\"Tripping\\" seems to tell his tale:<br /><br />\\"First they ignore you<br />Then laugh at you and hate you<br />Then they fight you - then you win\\"<br /><br />Most of the album is typical Robbie Williams, but having been two years in the making, it is lyrically improved over his other albums.  You can pick up influences of Shawn Mullins \\"Lullaby\\", and John Mellencamp's \\"Small Town\\" on \\"Spread Your Wings\\", and do a little `80s reminiscing on \\"Your Gay Friend\\" and \\"Sin Sin Sin\\",<br /><br />Never one to pass up a little humor, the almost religious \\"Make Me Pure\\" includes the tongue in cheek lyrics:<br /><br />\\"Oh Lord<br />Make me pure<br />But not yet\\"<br /><br />Another fun album from Robbie Williams with twelve good songs - will this be THE ONE to finally make him a part of the mainstream USA pop scene?  You'll be the judge of that.  Rated 4.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards
B0000DEOZ9|4.0|Again the Pet Shop Boys played their little trick on their fans. The album Very was released in 1994, and didn't do very well commercially or critically, and while the Pet Shop Boys shortly thereafter toured, it had the feeling (partly due to the rumour mill) that this was in fact a farewell series of performances. The next year, when the dual-disc set Alternative was released, the question was largely, 'Alternative to what?' -- a real album, a continuation (Alternative was made up of all the non-album b-sides that had been released during the Pet Shop Boys career, once again fueling speculation that this was a tying-up-of-loose-ends at the end of a career).<br /><br />Then, in 1996, the album Bilingual was released, again following the by-then-well-established pattern of releasing a single, then follow-up with the album. This was an 'out' album; while most people always knew the alternative sexuality of the group, it had never been made explicit in the group's official publicity. Now, it had been. No surprise to anyone really (does anything coming from any band from the 80's really surprise anyone?).<br /><br />The Pet Shop Boys managed to release an adequate album, alas, not their best work, and indeed some commentators, remembering the speculation that they were ready to retire, opined that retirement would have been better than this.<br /><br />Not so, to be sure -- this is a perfectly serviceable album, good in many respects; the first single, Before, was released with a CD-movie of the video (very useful for those without Euro-MTV, American MTV long since having left the genre of the Pet Shop Boys behind and thus unlikely to carry their videos even when they win Euro-MTV awards). This song included many of the classic Pet Shop Boys elements -- poppy dance tune, double-edged lyrics, sample heavy feel, and toe-tapping rhythm.<br /><br />The rest of the album is influenced obviously by the groups adventures in Latin America and Latin Europe during their concert tour, as well as holidays in the sun. Songs such as Discoteca and Se a vida &eacute; contain in their titles the influence; peppered throughout with almost spoken lines in Spanish (&iquest;Hay una discoteca por acqui?), almost as if they had simply lifted lines from their Berlitz travel phrase book. But, in the traditional quirky Pet Shop Boys way, these fit in nicely with the tune.<br /><br />The transitions on this album are interesting -- for the first time, the Pet Shop Boys didn't have their songs as isolated bits, but many instead flowed together--Discoteca and Single being two prime examples, which bleed together musically and lyrically, the end of Single being also the first line from Discoteca: (&iquest;Hay una discoteca por acqui?).<br /><br />Songs in the much more traditional upbeat, lyrically-cynical and clever, electronically pop include To step aside, A red letter day, and Saturday night forever. Tennant begins to allow himself some more direct social commentary in songs like The survivors, which can be understood on many levels. Of course, Tennant's lyrics on the album Behaviour poked fun at those celebrities who, because they have fame, suddenly start taking themselves seriously as experts on social concerns, so he is understandably cautious and understated in his own observations, which are usually very much rooted in his own, direct experiences.<br /><br />As with many Pet Shop Boys albums, Bilingual had a follow-up single, Somewhere, which was not included on the album, but was on the special edition, limited release of the double-CD Bilingual. This second disc includes in addition to Somewhere remixes of several of the album cuts, as well as an additional b-side.<br /><br />The songs Before, Single, and A red letter day charted variously around the world, but didn't catch hold and take top honours anywhere. Alas, the Pet Shop Boys looked like they were past it. But history has proven differently.<br /><br />This is an essential album to anyone who wishes a complete Pet Shop Boys collection -- the special album only for those die-hard collectors who can spend extra on auction sites or some such to track it down, but one gains little musically from it. However, this album is for the most part a placeholder in the overall history of the Pet Shop Boys (for the historically inclined, perhaps it is the 'James Polk' of their albums, adequate but undistinguished, often forgotten, but still on the books).one who wishes a complete Pet Shop Boys collection -- the special album only for those die-hard collectors who can spend extra on auction sites or some such to track it down, but one gains little musically from it.

B000ASDFJU|4.0|I find this set awesome!!! Finally a great looking box to hold all the seasons discs and with extras. Can't wait to buy it! Or even better, I'll ask my better half to buy me this for Xmas! Yeepee! <br /> <br />One BIG QUESTION though (as one user has already mentioned): <br /> <br />Are the following things included in this set: <br /> <br />Three never-before-seen alternate endings to series finale <br /> <br />Two farewell tributes (30 mins. each) <br /> <br />Thanx for all your answers! :) <br /> <br />Btw, I gave this a strong 4 (leaning towards 5), simply cause I don't know if these features I mentioned above are in the set or not. In addition, when I got season six as a present I was, among other things, looking so much forward to the alternate endings and the tributes and found terrible fact about European Edition - nothing! Just shows and that's it. So, I'm definitely a buyer of this upcoming set, but only if there're these bonus featurettes inside.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|We just went to see Wicked in Chicago, and, no suprise of course,  I got so much more out of the play by reading the book first. I was better able to understand not  only the dynamics of the characters better, but even understood the set and props used when they went over the heads of others. Wonderfully written, very witty, I would reccommend for an easy read before bed.
0307276902|4.0|Reading this book was painful for me in several ways.<br /><br />First, I have a friend who is addicted to crack cocaine, and he's been in and out of rehab more times than I can truly count.  This enabled me to cut through the glitz that he always puts on his stints in rehab and see how truly difficult addiction is.<br /><br />The other is because of the open stream consciousness of the writing itself.  It nearly makes you crazy, but that's the point.  The mind of an addict, especially when going through withdrawl, isn't clear or punctuated at all.  It's insanity at its finest.  For an editor to have even attempted to clean this up would have been a disservice, because it truly takes you inside that headspace and allows you to feel that utter confusion.<br /><br />The other thing I wanted to address is a reviewer that said they hoped others wouldn't read this book and decide to do as Frey did, and not follow the principles of AA.  AA is a religious based approach to sobriety.  While you can plug the name of whatever deity in there that you lay your faith in the hands of, you still know it was constructed by something you may not believe in.  That in itself keeps a lot of people from seeking treatment through AA.  What I hope is that people read this book and see that they can get clean if they truly want to.  For those not addicted to substances, I hope they'll read it and see what addiction is truly like, and perhaps be able to take some compassion and apply where needed.
0060273224|2.0|Right from the start, something felt wrong with this book. It probably has something to do with the way the author introduces you into this new world. The problem is he doesn't realy introduce you, he just throws you right in, without further explanation. I honeslty do not need a detailed explanation in order to understand what I'm reading, but the way this story starts, made me feel this book was not going to have any depth. And it didn't.<br /><br />I kept reading to see if the book, the story and the writing would get any better.<br /><br />The story itself is not that bad, but the writing is. Garth Nix writes anything but fluent. Sentences, even words just don't feel right. Although the story is extremely predictable, I did get surprised sometimes when something happened. One moment I was reading about one thing, then the next sentence there's something I didn't expect to read so quickly.<br /><br />Reading this book was like hearing someone having a speech, read from a peace of paper in the most monotone way I've ever heard.<br /><br />I wonder if Garth Nix had any fun writing this book. It seems like he was forced to write it. Within meaby three days.<br /><br />I missed the passion I often feel.
B000089RVX|5.0|Its catchy, its dark and heavy at times. <br />Shes an amazing singer, classicaly trained and they still wrote good catchy choruses and songs. <br />Amy has a bigger vocal range than it appears from this album(if you see her live she uses it a bit more) and I hope to hear lots of highs & lows, orchestas, choirs, and electronica. <br /> Overall, you won't be disappointed.
0307276902|5.0|James Frey really caputers the alcohlic. there were parts in the book I had to stop. It was real. I think James is a Great witer. There were times I had to stop & put the book down. I had trouble sleeping , so I had to get up & read. I have recomened it to all of my freinds

B000B2YQX4|4.0|I'm certainly not too impressed with the cover. The weird looking guy on the front looks a lot like the weird looking guy on the front of the latest Cure cd. It's never a good sign when the front cover looks like it was done by a child. Anyway on to the album track by track. <br /> <br />1. A PAIN THAT I'M USED TO  <br />The song starts with a sort of guitar gurgle that reminds me a whole lot of \\"I Feel You,\\" the opener to Songs of Faith and Devotion. This is very, very significant. Years ago, my friends and I observed that Depeche Mode were using Violator as a template for the album, Exciter. Now it seems that they've moved on to emulating Songs of Faith and Devotion. The delightful part of this is that although Violator is their most popular, Songs... is my favorite... cd... ever... by anyone. One reason I love Songs... so much is its supplementation of religious imagery alongside the standard rock and pop themes of life, love and lust. I counted once. That cd lyrically had about 70 references to some kind of religious element. That cd was also pretty ironically-titled. It's a cd rife with mistrust, lust, spite and resentment. Listening to the first familiar guitar gurgle of Playing the Angel made me think that perhaps they were angling for another tongue-in-cheek title. This is going to be another cd about religion, but they're not going to be proselytizing. They're going to be sarcastic. So anyway, I think all this during the first few notes of \\"A Pain That I'm Used To.\\" Excellent opener. Steady beat with a great crunch. Lyrically, it's a fabulous thesis for the whole canon of Depeche Mode. Depeche Mode don't whine about pain. They contend that pain is normal.  <br /> <br />2. JOHN THE REVELATOR  <br />The liner notes say \\"inspired by the traditional song of the same name.\\" I wish I have heard it. Is it so blatantly anti the guy? I like to think that the tone is a bit satiric, and that the narrator of the song wants to enjoy life instead of facing consequences.As a result, he wants to kill the messenger. A more likely story is that Martin Gore considered covering this song for one of his covers side projects, but just decided to re-tool the song to have the opposite meaning than the original. It does sound a lot like Martin's solo stuff. The vocals are more gospelly than the usual Depeche Mode, but sort of similar to \\"Get Right With Me\\" off Songs of Faith and Devotion. There are also some minor high tinkly synth beats that sound more Martin than the usual Depechey bass dance beat that accompanies the song. Danceable, but can you imagine anyone dancing to an anti-religious diatribe such as this one?  <br /> <br />3. SUFFER WELL  <br /> <br />One of the reasons I was most excited for the release of Playing the Angel was because I heard that David Gahan, the lead singer, would be contributing some songs. His solo album was mildly interesting with a bit more blues thrown in than one would guess. I guess he made some threats and Martin must have given in. I actually bought the cd with the bonus dvd and on the accompanying \\"making of\\" documentary I noticed that David and Martin never made eye contact when discussing the songwriting of this album. I feel sad that they didn't collaborate. David brought on two other musicians (Christian Eigner and Andrew Phillpott, whoever they are) to help him with his new day job, but Martin stayed put in his own stuff (and with no help from anyone else). \\"Suffer Well\\" is our first taste of Dave on a Depeche Mode effort. His team makes it sound enough like the usual Mode by intro-ing with a few gamey electronic blips and a guitar line that hearkens back to \\"Dream On\\" from Exciter. There are all sorts of space age beats in the background, but Dave was smart to keep the guitar in the foreground. It's also nice to hear Martin's tenor voice doing backup. Perhaps they're getting along better than I insinuated. Lyrically, this fits in perfectly with themes set up during \\"A Pain That I'm Used To.\\" Whatlittle writing Dave has done in his life has always been about addiction. This one is about enjoying the pain associated with it.  <br /> <br />4. THE SINNER IN ME  <br />The farting blips and quick clangs remind me of a sort of fast-paced \\"Clean\\" from Violator. The schizophrenic high and low beats compliment the sort of Jeckyll and Hyde idea of the song. The delivery by Dave is especially cool. He puts forth a certain characterization that certainly makes it seem that Hyde has already won. This is musically confirmed through the psycho guitar bridge toward the end.  <br /> <br />5. PRECIOUS  <br />The glossy \\"Precious\\" brings a smooth change of pace to the cd. It's also strangely the first single, which led me to believe the whole album would be more laid-back than it actually is. The dvd came with the video to this song which is very computer animated with weird boats and fish creatures and stuff. The song is groovier with repeat listenings.  <br /> <br />6. MACRO  <br />Martin takes the vocals for this one. It reminds me a bit of his work on \\"I Want You Now\\" from Music for the Masses. Both songs are about getting freaky. In this one, Martin relates the experience to becoming a god (best coital experience ever?). The instrumentality is pretty minimal, but sort of primal. Sounds like a great make-out song.  <br /> <br />7. I WANT IT ALL  <br />Dave part two! I was going to grade this one lower because his lyrics aren't as strong (\\"Sometimes I cry -- Sometimes I die it's true,\\" although it does contain the TLC-inspired \\"I see a river -- it's oceans that I want) and there's an annoying trumpet synth toward the end. I couldn't though because it's so contemplative-sounding. sort of like back-floating on a country pond at midnight. This sounds a lot more like his previous solo stuff.  <br /> <br />8. NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE  <br />For Dave's last writing credit he does an adequate job channeling Gary Numan's monotone heartless delivery over seemingly positive lyrics. Although the sounds are throwback early eighties Mode, they're not quite as exciting here. Well, who are we kidding, Depeche Mode weren't really really good until 1990. Dave stole from the Cure's \\"Apart\\" in lyrics.  <br /> <br />9. INTROSPECTRE  <br />Here's the obligatory instrumental track. They've sucked for the past ten years. This one sounds like electronic bagpipe warm-ups. The title is pretty cool though. It's also short enough to not even count. <br /> <br />10. DAMAGED PEOPLE  <br />Martin's on vocals again. The background clanks actually have a sort of Japanese parlour music characterization about them. The tune has a weird positivity that reminds me of \\"Black Celebration.\\" Unfortunately, the sound itself is like Martin's very weak \\"Comatose\\" from Exciter. It's unfortunate, that Martin and Dave didn't collaborate at all. Otherwise they probably wouldn't have both rhymed \\"cry\\" with \\"die.\\"  <br /> <br />11. LILIAN 3.5 <br />Ahhh, the beat and Dave finally come back! Dave's back with a sneer too. I've always wondered about song titles based on names of people. Weird spelling here. It's not about Lillian Gish. Is she a groupie maybe? I always think it's a groupie, but it's probably a name that just went with the music. At least that's what the members of the band say, I'm sure. Anyway, vintage theme of basking and having fun through spite. Fun tune. Very fun to sneer to.  <br /> <br />12. THE DARKEST STAR  <br />On the last cd, they ended with a song called \\"Goodnight Lovers,\\" which is a great song, but it almost sounded sort of happy, even though lyrically it was the usual stuff. Usually their final track is pretty dark. \\"Clean,\\" \\"Higher Love,\\" and \\"Insight\\" are the previous concluding tracks and they're all from dark soully territory. The mood returns with \\"The Darkest Star\\" which sounds like a combination of those three tunes. The term \\"playing the angel\\" appears here, which Dave sings as an insult and follows it with \\"Devil's companion.\\" Depeche Mode has always done an adequate job of self-describing dark souls, but when they blame someone else of being part of the dark side, they don't hold back. The blame game here is dark, heavy and slow, and Dave's delivery of dueling insults is simply delicious. The best part though, despite the insults, there's a demand to stay exactly the same.  <br /> <br />BONUS DVD TRACK. CLEAN (BARE) <br />Perhaps inspired by Johnny Cash's \\"Hurt,\\" Depeche Mode covered their own song a little more soulfully. Dave sings a lot more sincerelly. The subtle guitar compliments nicely. The minor tone doesn't completely make the song sincere, but it wouldn't be Depeche Mode if they wee completely sincere. I would love to hear more of their interpretations. I know many more new moods could be gleaned from their catalogue. <br /> <br />All in all, It's not as good as Songs of Faith and Devotion, but it was a lot better than I thought it would be.

B000B5IPLK|3.0|It's starting to seem like everytime an artists gets famous enough, record companies decide to have them put out any old thing and bleed fans out of another $20; no matter what the finished product soounds like.  I bought this album after all the hype and I wasn't impressed at all.  No doubt, Alicia Keys is very talented, but this unplugged album is a disappointment.  I feel that she has put on better live perfomances in the past and that one of those shoul've been recorded and sold instead.  I feel that I'm listening to her back up singers more than her, and they sound pretty good, but their names aren't on the album cover,maybe they should be.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|It took about 5 or 6 sessions to get into this album.  At first I didnt like its somewhat jagged sound.  However after a while, it really grew on me.  The songs do not come right out and grab you, rather I find they evolve and surprise you with great additions or endings that make the whole track shine.  I think that if a genre could be applied to this band, it would be shared by no current band of the time.  The sound can be referenced to bands like the Kinks or the Talking Heads, which IMHO arent very smooth, or dont really follow the rules, but just come up with cool ways to make you say \\"wow, that was a cool song\\".  Definitley pick it up.

B0001MDQ2G|4.0|It's not easy connecting to the metal scene when you live in Israel, everyday worries, the economy and the religion do not give much room for decent music in Israel ,what you get usually is silly pop music or repetetive oriental music which doesn't add to much. Another common problem in Israeli music is that musicians in a given band, do not let their talent shine, I mean they do not engage technical solos, riffs or rythems, it's tough to explain, but it's a problem I noticed in Isareli music,; musicians are either unispired or shy.<br /><br />Orphaned Land, very surprising assembly, hell, they even make me like oriental music, I just wish there were MORE growling, because they sound really good alongside the tender voice of the oriental musician in the band. Orphaned Land; thoroughbred Israeli metal heads with Israeli oriental guidos. The ablum is thick in sound, some surprising technical ability all over (again, VERY surprising in Israeli music) a scary narrative (the flood story in the Bible) and terrific vocals. I am completly sold on this album, I just hope they don't lose their heavy edge.
B00009ATKS|4.0|I accidently drifted into Mogwai in '01 from a Nick Drake phase I was going through.  I had was not into Sigur Ros yet, and I had not heard anything like it.  Fast forward 3 years, I was well into Sigur Ros by almost 3 years and I saw them in '04 with The Cure.  I was hooked!  Bought this album the next day and have been hooked ever since.  Got to love the bow on the guitar.
B0002OERI0|5.0|i love this cd its undoutably the greatest single accievment by man, forget landing on the moon. Not only music in general but life would have been reduced to a plain lifeless wasteland had Billy, Tre, Mike?, and that guy who plays guitar at there shows (but is never mentionened/credited),had not made this record. I love every single chord they play and all 5 of them never get boring even after the 300th time but in a different order an I LOVE THERE NEW IMAGE even more than there 5 cords this new \\"were punk we swear... we make fun of the american government so we must be punk\\"image really works for them. And the last thing i love(but certaintly not the least) is there great title/lyrics. While 95 out of 100 punk bands have leftist political lyrics (the other 4 being fascists and 1 being good time kinda bands) its great that Green Day didnt want me to hurt my brain trying to understand the message behind there music like the dead kennedys, pink floyd(animals), the germs,the sex pistols  etc. Instead of confusing me with metaphors, imagery, deep,thought prevoking lyrics or great music to detract from the message Green Day tells it to me flat out without all this \\"artistry\\" that clouds other punk bands: Green Day tells me America sucks and Jesus sucks to and IF GREEN DAY SAYS IT IT MUST BE TRUE! WHO NEED OPINIONS WHEN GREEN DAY CAN TELL YOU HOW TO THINK!!!  BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU LOVE POP PUNK (ITS THE ONLY GENRE THAT CANT STOOP ANY LOWER!!!)
B00018D44U|5.0|In the modern world of hustle and bustle people don't take time for music like this and for me it's been a revelation. I'm just getting into Blues. I have listened to Jazz for many many.... many years but haven't really taken time with the Blues. She has taken some Mississippi mud and formed something I didn't expect to find. This music is timeless because she brings you back to the where Blues came from but in a clean modern setting. She is essential music in my opinion and highly undervalued as a musician. I own both of her musical ventures to date and both of these are very powerful in their simplicity, straight forwardness and honesty. The sheer majesty that people miss in her music is that she isn't pretentious about who she is but she knows her value. This is good stuff.
0553502271|3.0|It was a good story with some adventure and good characters.  I enjoyed the characters and the story line.  It could've been that Im use to the type of thriller like \\"The Client\\", but It was a good read, but I didn't think it was his best.  I would've expected more  suspense, underhanding and backstabbing especially with 11 Billion as the prize.  I still recommend the book, but its a bit short on the suspense.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Saw is a horror movie released last year that certainly delivers. Its cast is basically made up of people that I never heard of besides Danny Glover. It certainly has its faults as does every movie but it is a genius horror movie compared to the rest of them.   First off, most of what happens in the movie is effective. It opens with two men in a room, chained to posts. They don't know each other. Information is left telling them that one of them needs to kill the other in a certain amount of time or his family will be killed. Soon, they realize that they've been abducted by the Jigsaw Killer, a highly insane madman. Meanwhile, detectives are investigating his murders and are trying to find the newest victims before it's too late for them.   The movie packs chills a plenty and some scenes will make you grossed out. For a horror movie, it's in the top 5 I've ever seen; for a regular movie, it still is a very good movie worth the watch.   The ending has a huge twist that was geniously conceived and worth the watch alone. Everything clicks right though in this movie that is simply a must see. I am eagerly awaiting the sequel but I doubt that it will be able to surpass this movie.   So this Halloween, rent Saw, check it out and then watch the sequel which I'm sure will be great.   The ending in my opinion is one of the best ever in horror movies and really came out of nowhere and it will make you view the movie differently every time you will see it.   Now for the real review...This movie is in my opinion better than all of the Hannibal movies. Why? Because this movie is very entertaining. It is obvious that it was a low budget movie but this plot is genius. The whole time, you're on the edge of your seat. You're like on a roller coaster ride..and when you think that it will slow down, it just keeps on going until at the end when the roller coaster just blows up. The ending is to me the best I've ever seen. Look how genius it is. Don't tell me any of you thought of it! Sure the Silence of the Lambs has better acting but really..this movie is splendid and really entertaining. I loved it and now own it because it's a one of kind movie regarded by most as your average horror flick but it's not..like Identity, this movie becomes more than a horror movie..it becomes an excellent movie..a smart thriller with great thrills and twists that is worthy to add to your collection. So please don't regard this as your typical so so horror movie that you might want to rent for Halloween. Because what you will find here if you look a little closer is a geniously thought out movie that is trully one of a kind.
B000001Y79|2.0|I loved \\"Don't Speak\\"..but the rest of the cd is so-so.
B00000DF6O|5.0|In my opinion, this CD contains BB King's finest work.  It is a great compilation of smooth blues from beginning to end and truly reflects the intended ambiance of a casual Louisianna setting without modern day recording magic. Simply a talented team of accomplished musicians with BB King singing some pure down home blues.  I highly recommend this CD and consider it a must have for any serious blues fan!
B000089RVX|5.0|This is my fav cd! It's the only cd I have where I never press skip.  I woudl give it many more stars if I could. My fav songs are Bring me to Life, Tourniquet (should have been a single!), Whisper, etc... I highly recommend this cd!

B000687M48|2.0|Let me start off by saying I'm a huge Evanescence fan and I love Fallen. But Anywhere But Home was disappointing. It's actualy just a Live cd with only 2 new songs not on Fallen. The cd doesn't even say anywhere on it that it's a live cd with not really much new. I felt very cheated out of my money. PLus her voice isn't too great live. It's good I guess bc it's more raw ...but I much rather listen to Fallen over this anyday.
B000AY807Q|4.0|a life threatening ailment and/or the passing of an important person from your life can make you pause and reflect.  on \\"prarie wind\\" neil is in a reflective mood.  the disc opens with \\"the painter\\", an infectious melody which might be construed as an ode to a certain fellow canadian musician neil has been linked to since the early days.  \\"no wonder\\" employs the same musical motif as \\"the old homestead\\" from \\"hawks and doves\\" and laments the current environmental condition, by comparing it with the prarie of his childhood. \\"falling off the face of the earth\\" is a heart display.  \\"far from home\\" recounts the family sing-a-longs of his youth \\"that left a big mark\\" on him.  the horns help to give it a raucous feel.  \\"it's a dream\\" is perhaps the most beatiful song neil has ever recorded.  a poignant reflection on the ephemeral nature of life, it is reminiscent of some of the best van morrison has to offer.  the title tune is a soulful affair that combines funky horns and effective backing vocals which include those from spouse pegi young.  \\"here for you\\" seems like it might be for his children, something any parent can relate to. \\"this old guitar\\" is about the instrument he plays throughout the recording, which once belonged to hank williams(background vocals by emmylou).  \\"he was the king\\" was probably more fun for neil to record then it is for his fans to listen to; the only dispensable song in the bunch.  the closing song is \\"when god made me\\",a diatribe concerning the current lack of religious tolerance in this country cleverly cloaked in christian church music.  a fine mature offering from neil.  the DVD shows the disc being recorded, good if you're interested in the process.
B0002M3V0C|5.0|I can listen to this cd all the way through wihtout pressing skip, yay. Their style is very unique. Overall I love the cd...especialy the songs This Love, Harder to Breathe, She Will be Loved, Sunday Morning, Through With You, and Sweetest Goodbye. The bonus Track RagDoll is really good, I wonder why it wasn't on their non import cd. The remixes are ok, but a nice edition to the cd considering the import version cost the same as the regular cd.
B000AL730O|5.0|As a Beatle fanatic, I would always buy anything put out by the former members. When it came to Paul, every recording seemed to have a few good ones and alot of filler or as John would say \\"musik\\". Band on the run, THe first album, Ram, and tug of war (which also had alot of ebony and ivory garbage) were the best. The rest were average. Finally, a complete album which revists the glory days. Paul goes back to basics with a recording I cannot get tired of listening to. If you enjoyed the later day Beatle albums and initial solo albums, I strongly recommend you buy this album. When you begin to listen, it will take you back and make you smile realizing he can still make memorable music.
B00000F1D3|5.0|This is a great song to listen to after a breakup! The songs Believe, ***Runaway***, **Strong Enough***, and We all sleep alone  are my favs. I love how she changed with the times to gain younger fans! The only downside I guess is that whevnever I hear this CD I visualize gay guys dancing in a thong on a bar table, lol.

B000068IEU|1.0|The Curmudgeon has seen his fair share of all these \\"video nasties\\" and they're all, with the exception of previously banned standards like Clockwork Orange, Exorcist and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, complete crap. Dire acting, lousy direction - just because a film has bucket loads of fake blood does NOT make it frightening.<br /><br />One of the more notorious of the banned series would be Wes Craven't Last House On The Left, a charmless movie showing what happens when normal people are pushed to the extremities of survival (like Hills Have Eyes, but nowhere near as good).<br /><br />The problem with Last House On The Left isn't it's plot, which is pretty good (teenage girls go to a party, get kidnapped by rapists, get abused and then the parents get revenge), but the whole package is just so shoddy. The dialogue is awful, with poorly delivered lines that don't convince for one second (compare to the natural flow of dialogue in, say, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and the acting is abysmal. And let's not even get started on the totally misplaced \\"comedy cops\\", along with funny music to really get the ribs tickled. Yup, after watching teenage girls get raped there's nothing funnier than stoner cops. Hee-haw.<br /><br />Wes Craven would, of course, go onto far better things (Hills, Nightmare On Elm Street) but this seems to have got some kind of reputation as a long lost classic. It really isn't - it doesn't convince for a second, it's not scary and it's just another in the long line of turgid exploitation flicks.  If you DO buy this movie though (those of you foolish enough to ignore The Curmudgeon's advice) you won't, like the tag-line says, be repeating to yourself \\"it's just a movie, it's just a movie\\", it'll be more along the lines of \\"I can sell this on ebay, I can sell this on ebay.\\" Wretched.<br /><br />(...)
0156027321|5.0|Read this book. It is incredible.
B0009P42S2|5.0|This is a great movie, i loved every minute of it. It takes place in old times which makes it even better. The animation is a 10star, the voice acting is a 10star, and the Music is an 11star. It was all great and This is the best movie i have seen. I have seen Akira and it was a great movie, but Steamboy is a lot better. It is a movie you can watch with anybody. I dont understand the PG-13 rating since i caught no bad words or anything of the sort. There is also a feature where you can watch the end credits without the words, and an interview with Katsuhiro Otomo, Re-voicing the movie, and a few other great things. And it says mastered in High Definition!!! I will say it again this is the best movie i have seen in a while.
B000BISBDY|5.0|The recently released \\"Legend of Johnny Cash\\" compilation is the first single-disc collection to cover the legendary Man In Black's entire career. While it would take literally a half-dozen CDs or more to cover every important piece of music Cash has made, this compilation offers the basics and is an excellent overview of his most important and classic work. The legendary Sun records hits, \\"Cry Cry Cry\\", \\"Hey Porter\\", \\"I Walk The Line\\" and \\"Folsum Prison Blues\\" are included here as well as \\"A Boy Named Sue\\", \\"Ring Of Fire\\" and \\"Highwayman\\" (his collaboration with Country legends Kris Kristoferson, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson). Also included is Johnny's cameo appearance from U2's 1993 \\"Zooropa\\" album, \\"The Wanderer\\" and to close out the disc, there are several tracks from his American Records series with producer Rick Rubin including the final hit \\"Hurt\\" (originally by Nine Inch Nails).<br /><br />With that said, \\"the Legend of Johnny Cash\\" is an essential collection and offers an excellent brief history lesson of his most acclaimed work. For the few who have never heard of Johnny Cash, this CD is an excllent introduction to his music. For everyone else, this is probably the best collection of Cash music to date.

B000000OS2|5.0|Tesla's Five Man Acoustical Jam, may not have been the first band to try the unplugged thing, but Tesla were the one's that made the unplugged performance the popular trend that it was in the early ninties. After Five Man Acoustical Jam, a lot of artists starting releasing cds from MTV Unplugged appearances. Springsteen and Nirvana, to just name a few.  <br /> <br />Tesla's Five Man Acoustical Jam is not your typical live album. With this cd you can tell everybody's having a goodtime. The band and the fans are really enjoying themselves, not taking things to seriously. The intimatcy of the performance is great. Many highlights from Tesla's first two albums and great oldies covers make this a great cd.  <br /> <br />Tesla turns Five Man Electrical Band's \\"Signs\\" into their own song. What a great rendetion. Other covers Tesla performs include Truckin' and Lodi. The Five Man Acoustical Jam really shows off the talents of Tesla and is an excellent and rewarding album.
B000002JB8|5.0|The brief, offhand comments tossed off by the editorial reviewer of this excellent album are obviously at odds with what a lot of fans are saying about this gem. Ocean waves lead into a short, majestic introduction with strings, harp, woodwind, a lovely violin. The follow-up is a quick climb to a pulsating, delightful \\"Siren's Whispering.\\" The sirens sing vocalise, and are then answered by an exciting men's choir. There is grandeur in the sound of this music, and yet it is always restrained and calming.<br /><br />I am, admittedly, a big Vangelis fan, but there is perhaps no other work of his that has such focus, a completely felicitous combination of pop and classical elements. I have played this on low volume at night as the crew and I fall asleep after a long day of sailing; then my vessel is filled with a rich and soothing, peaceful music.<br /><br />The excitement dies down and the well-named \\"Dreams of Surf\\" is a serene interlude for piano and a luminous background of electronica.<br /><br />Spanish Harbor is edgier, a quiet rocker with long crescendos and decrescendos. The highlight is the Spanish guitar, accompanied by an atmospheric orchestral background, shimmering and luminous.<br /><br />In Islands of the Orient, Vangelis explores Asian rhythmic complexities in a meditative piece. There is a jazzy subtext to this music, and it ends with considerable energy and percussion.<br /><br />Fields of coral is another quiet piece, of lento mood and reverberant arpeggios. A bell-like keyboard makes this a particularly attractive piece.<br /><br />A lovely theme is explored in Aquatic Dance, which is, as the title indicates, more oriented toward movement. The nostalgic Memories of Blue, reverent in tone, and the finale, Song of the Seas, bring this beautiful album to a contempative close.<br /><br />I love so many Vangelis albums, despite the occasional bombast and misfire. Here, however, there is no exaggeration, no self-indulgence, and the result is one of the sweetest, most endearing recordings Vangelis ever made. I'll end by noting that this is not merely innocuous music. There is an intensity under the slickly produced sheen of clear sound, a careful selection of ingratiating musical themes with subtle development that renders them larger than life, noble and uplifting in feel. It's quite an accomplishment, I'd humbly observe.sult is one of the sweetest, most endearing recordings Vangelis ever made. I'll end by noting that this is not merely innocuous music.

B00005JO9J|1.0|This is soapy garbage. Just how much sex are these doctors having? Probobly more than the doctors on ER and the ones on <br />the long gone Chicago Hope. This, like HOUSE, M.D., is a medical show that, although includes many cast members, is mainly about one person. The theme song sucks and the dialogue is cheesy. This nonesense belongs in a daytime slot. If you want a MEDICAL show, watch ER. If you want a HOSPITAL soap, then this is by all means the trash you are looking for.

B00005R1N3|4.0|I just finished watching this movie and I must say it was good. Definatly what you would expect from a 70's horror movie. After watching this movie I realize how many horror movies that came after it that copied this classic. One of the things I like about older horror movies is the fact they provide \\"mystery\\" to the movie. Unlike with movies now that have an \\"happy\\" ending.

B000001FS3|5.0|Even though U2 had always played it broad and blaring, it was always the inner message that kept the band's integrity above the pomp. Even in the anthems \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"Pride,\\" the message was delivered with earnest bombast. That didn't stop those songs from being terrific rock and roll, and Bono is, simply put, a frontman that rates with the likes of Springsteen. The Edge, well, he just got more and more amazing as each album appeared.<br /><br />Still, \\"The Joshua Tree\\" is the band's masterstroke. It was as if they entered a spiritual retreat and emerged with a greater focus and an alarming, newly subtle, clarity. The politics don't completely vanish (\\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\" remains as timely today as it did during Reagan's South American misadventures), but things suddenly became more personal. \\"With Or Without You\\" is a bitter emancipation statement, and the gospelish \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" finds Bono chiding himself for both his overblown personality and his own questions of faith. For a band that staked its reputation on being carriers of grand statements, that first single was a daring proclomation.<br /><br />The rest of \\"The Joshua Tree\\" maintains that bravery and wonderment. The trio of Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno and Steve Lillywhite brought their strongest production game to the studio for this album, and the grace to a song like \\"One Tree Hill\\" and the other sonic lighteners (like the gradual build of \\"With Or Without You\\") brought out the best in the band, challenging them to outdo all their prior work. And they did so handily, baring their souls in the process.<br /><br />\\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\" is still an amazing call-to-arms and \\"Red Hill Town\\" paints a portrait of the band's coal mining countrymen and shares the same kind of empathy that Sting's \\"Island Of Lost Souls\\" brought to shipbuilders on \\"The Soul Cages.\\" This was U2 at the peak of their early years, and though I'd have a hard time giving up any of their early albums from my library, \\"The Joshua Tree\\" is probably the one I'd take to a desert island.<br /><br />(While we're at it, why has this album and the U2 catalog not been upgraded? U2 are easily one of the best and most influential bands on the planet, and their early albums deserve more than to have shoddy liner notes and a late 80's quality CD transfer.)library, \\"The Joshua Tree\\" is probably the one I'd take to a desert island.

B0000027RL|5.0|First, sorry for my poor vocabulary, I'd like to have the finest and appropriate words to describe such a powerful work of art. I'm always going around telling whoever I can that this is the best album of the 90's, and the more the time passes, the more I believe it! From my personal point of view, Eddie has the most emotionally powerful voice I've ever heard, being deep, sweet and aggressive on the same song or on the same album, letting us exploring his \\"insides\\" (using his word) through his evocative lyrics. Reading the other reviews, Eddie is not causing the same emotions to someone else, but I guess these are exceptions...  <br />I owe the whole PJ discography, and every cd has its \\"pearls\\" in it. But this album... remains my favourite. Black, Jeremy (the best one), Even Flow, Why Go, Release, are the highest expressions of PJ, and, in my personal opinion, of the music scene ever. <br />

0618001905|5.0|This is a dreadful but riveting story exceptionally well told. Revealing heroes and villains in equal number, it tells the tale of the founding of an African state that is, to this day, still reeling from the tyrannies learned at its birth.  It is meticulously researched and beautifully written in a page turning style that holds attention without becoming, in the worst sense, commercial.  King Leopold is, along with Hitler, Stalin and others of their ilk, one of the arch villains of all time and, as like attracts like, his coldness, cruelty and greed filtered down the ranks to the men who did his dirty work on the ground.  He is, eventually brought down, in a manner of speaking, by the dogged persistence of ordinary men, both black and white, who, without wealth or position, fought him on the international stage in any way open to them.  Hochschild brings these men, George Washington Williams, E. D. Morel, Sir Roger Casement, William H. Shepherd, to name a few, to our attention. Would that all histories were as readable as this.

B00027JYLC|5.0|When you consider that this film, actually a type of<br /><br />\\"historical documentation\\" of the world of human anomalies (Freaks of the sideshow), was made in 1932, it's a 5-Star on the single merit that someone had the guts to commit the images to film. - That \\"someone\\" being Tod Browning, the producer, (of \\"Dracula\\" fame).  When you view it, you won't wonder why it was banned for many years - you'll know!.<br /><br />It is impossible to look away when you see the \\"pinheads\\", the \\"half-man\\", the \\"living torso\\", and all the sideshow attractions as they were. The scene around the \\"marriage table\\", is only trumped by the scene when the freaks converge on Hercules - and perhaps the \\"Trump Card\\" is the fate of the beautiful trapeze artist, and her introduction to the Freak's world - A fate she juslty deserves.<br /><br />It is no wonder why this extraordinary film was selected to the National Film Registry's archive of cinematic treasures.

I tried to learn Java through a number of other teach myself methods. It was not until I read Head First Java that I actually got it. Since then, I have moved on to more advanced concepts and have had a lot of fun with coding. Unfortunately, most books that deal with teaching development read like someone's thesis. Bates and Sierra have provided a book that is not only a very effective teaching tool but also a whole lot of fun to read. I wish all cerebral subjects were taught this way. If you like fooling around in the library, then you will love Head First Java and the Head First series!

0740748475|5.0|This is just to correct the review below which states that the pages are glued to the spine instead of sewn. This is not true. The pages are indeed bound in signatures,  6-page signatures to be precise (I believe this is not an usual number, but the paper is thick; they are signatures all the same), 8 stitches per signature. Which to my eyes is a very good binding, as good as any hardback and better than most. <br /> <br />On the other hand, I would have liked a complete cloth cover, instead of half paper-half cloth. I see the paper corners wearing out, etc. But on the glued-sewn business, there are no complaints. <br /> <br />The contents themselves are well described elsewhere on this page and they are simply fantastic.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I would like to comment on the DVD version of this movie - with all the hype surrounding a movie such as this and the fact that it only released in South Africa 2 weeks after I had received it from Amazon - implies that my first experience with this movie was on DVD. I must stress - I am grateful for that. Watching this movie on a my 42 inch Panasonic Plasma with the DTS soundtrack is one amazing experience. The stories in the movie itself are very captivating - my favourite being the Mickey Rourke character called Marv - this guy was supercool! The stylization in the movie is first class and reminiscent of previous Tarantino/Rodriguez flicks. The movie deserves to watched over and over again for the script, characters and downright super-coolness. As for the DVD transfer - perfect in my eyes- the black and white pictures enhance what little colour there is and especially on a Plasma screen - strikes out at you. DO yourself a favour and purchase this movie NOW - or if you can - wait for the December Extended Edition release ( I Could not).
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I was thinking about buying this CD because I liked a couple songs I heard on the radio.  Then when I got here and saw it was copy protected I decided I didn't need to spend that money after all.  Frankly I refuse to buy a music CD crippled by copy protection.  I will not fund a company, or band for that matter, that won't let people rip the music they bought to an iPod, even though I could very easily get around it.  (This doesn't mean I'm going to go download it illegally, I don't do that.)  I actually just don't want their music anymore.  In fact I've heard a couple of their songs on the radio since I first found out about this and now I don't even enjoy hearing them anymore.
0141439831|5.0|At Miss Pinkerton's Academy for Young Ladies, two girls are leaving the security of the school for the marital opportunities of the world; one is all heart and no head, the other all head and no heart. Becky Sharp and Amelia Sedley are girls from two very different backgrounds; Amelia has been raised in wealth and privilege, whilst Becky is an orphan whose late parents were a painter and an opera singer. Their prospects for the future are looking very different indeed, but Becky in particular is determined to make a way for herself in the world, to claw her way up the social ladder, to integrate herself fully into Vanity Fair and establish a place for herself in the world...no matter what the cost.<br /><br />So what is \\"Vanity Fair\\"? The title originated in John Bunyan's allegorical \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", which describes the Christian's journey to the Celestial City, passing though the dangers and temptations that await them in life, represented by several metaphorical destinations. Vanity Fair is one such place, filled with \\"whores, bawds, wives, husbands, children, masters, servants, lives, blood, bodies, souls, silver, gold, pearls, precious stones, and what not\\" - a list of commodities where the lives of men and women are ranked alongside gold and jewels.<br /><br />Many years later, William Makepeace Thackeray borrowed the conceit for the novel he was publishing serially in \\"Punch\\" magazine, which was in fact the perfect title for the story he was creating. Set in Napoleonic England, Vanity Fair is the country, society and state of mind in which his characters dwell, wrapped up in affairs of greed, materialism, warfare, society and intrigue. Such is the world that innocent Amelia and conniving Becky are sent out into, both to walk their very different - but often interconnecting - paths. Amelia is betrothed to her childhood sweetheart and family friend George Osborne, a handsome but spoilt young man - not that she is aware of that, being utterly blinded by her love and devotion to her young soldier. She's too blind to even notice the adoration of the clumsy and nervous Captain Dobbin, traits which keep him from being a hero in her (and everyone else's) eyes.<br /><br />On the other hand, Becky (after failing to secure a match with Amelia's brother Joseph Sedley) finds employment as a governess in the household of Sir Pitt Crawley, a lecherous and sinful old man whose estate has long since fallen into disrepair. However Becky is determined to make the most of it, especially when it comes to winning the favour of the rich Miss Crawley, the family's \\"maiden aunt\\" - which may furthermore throw her into the path of the rakish Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Though the subtitle is \\"A Novel Without a Hero\\" (apt, since all of the male characters subvert the idea of what we would deem \\"heroic\\"), Amelia and Becky can perhaps be considered the novel's heroines, as it is their stories that make up the narrative drive of the book. Amelia certainly fits the bill of a beautiful, romantic, helpless little Victorian heroine, but even more so is the character of Becky, of whom Thackeray himself said: \\"I like Becky in that book. Sometimes I think I have myself some of her tastes.\\" Utterly ruthless, heartless, witty, charming and determined, Becky is still as much of an enigma today as she was in Thackeray's day. Though by contemporary standards it is rather easy to admire Becky for her intelligence and survival tactics (as the recent \\"Vanity Fair\\" movie adaptation starring Reese Witherspoon certainly did), there is a definite darkness to her that makes you rather uneasy.<br /><br />Take for example the early scene of Becky throwing back the gift of a dictionary in the faces of her school-mistresses Miss Pinkerton and Miss Jemima: an act of defiance and rejection. But though we like and admire her for thumbing her nose at the snotty Miss Pinkerton, we are equally aware that she has done the same to Miss Jemima, who has gone out of her way to ensure Becky receives the parting gift of a dictionary like the other girls. Such is Becky's dilemma, that she not only rejects scorn and snide remarks; but also acts of kindness and charity toward her - life for her has long since ceased to be anything but a competition. As it stands, we can neither completely sympathise with Amelia nor completely condemn Becky - both are women struggling to survive in a world where their welfare is completely reliant on men.<br /><br />Also of interest is the narrator's voice within the text; presumably representing Thackeray himself rather than some omnipresent being, who treats and describes his characters as puppets that he's manipulating in the setting of Vanity Fair. As well as this, he is a character in his own right, who recounts meetings and discussions with the characters, documenting the notes and letters they send to each other, and incorporating historical events and figures (most obviously the Napoleonic War) into his text. Due also to the fact that he's often contradicting himself, the narration itself comes across as one of the more fascinating aspects of the novel, and to my knowledge has never been attempted to such a degree before or since in literature.<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is not for the faint-of-heart reader; it is long, complicated and sometimes tedious (I found the pace slowed down considerably after the Battle of Waterloo). However, there are rewards for those that stick with it - it is frequently hilarious, often fascinating, and leaves you with a distinct feeling of melancholy unease, especially if you yourself are living in Vanity Fair. Thackeray's characters you see, are doomed to live out their lives in that hollow and ultimately meaningless place - and their lives stand as a testiment and a warning as to going there yourself.<br /><br />As the only novel of the time that gave Charles Dickens a run for his money, and penned by an author of whom Charlotte Bronte (author of \\"Jane Eyre\\") said: \\"stands alone in his sagacity, alone in his truth, alone in his feeling...Thackeray is a Titan,\\" Vanity Fair remains one of the great pieces of Western literature.

It also has very cool FX (Loni Peristere and the Zoic team truly outdid themselves) and incredible acting. Summer Glau is a revelation as River, and none of the other (and beloved) cast members miss a single beat. From the newbies, I specially enjoyed Chiwetel's performance and can only hope for some sort of continuation to this wonderful saga.

If you want to spend a few sorta entertaining hours, you'll do okay, however, if you're thinking this is a great read, a clever and intriguing read, sorry no. Excellent story premise, once in a while a fun line, but mostly superficial and so-not the thought provoking piece we were all hoping for. Mr. Hornby you need a few more drafts before this one is ready to release. Or let a great screenwriter take the premise and just run with it. It would be fun as a movie if better developed. P.S. Why Mr. Hornby selected the most unflattering photo ever seen as the author's pix I have no idea.

0790729628|5.0|Three genres are traced back to Expressionism: film noir, science fiction, and horror.  All three are represented to some effect (well, maybe not so much horror, though a few moments are spine-tingling) to create the dirty, sulky atmosphere of 2019 Los Angeles, where the rich have gone to live on the off-world colonies and the rest of humanity bubbles and ferments in a disgusting world of industrial sludge and ever-pouring rain, a world now penetrated by four replicants (androids) escaped from the off-world colonies and who must be hunted down by Deckard, a blade runner.<br /><br />Such is the overview of the richly articulated and darkly felt exploration into humanity and creation, where humans have created humans and those humans are aggressors against their creators.  Man, beast, and robot are mixed and only divided by social taboos and product numbers, only that doesn't necessarily make the humans much different either considering how literally crushed they are by industry and advertising ever flashing through the streets in neon signs.<br /><br />The story arch follows Deckard as he is forced unwillingly into hunting down the escaped replicants and slowly finds all roles reversed, both of the hunt and of the status.  As he falls in love with the replicant Rachel, Deckard is forced to hide her from the very people he works for just as much as he's forced to pass their judgement on people whose only crime is the desire to live.  Such poetic exposition is not realized through the human characters; their actions are too mechanic and bland that they nearly seem invisible.  It's realized in the replicants, who desire, love, feel, and hurt.<br /><br />This is an awesome and powerful look into what it means to be human and God.  Both the stylistic elements and the craftsmanship of this film work together perfectly to create an atmosphere often attempted but never as fully realized in this distinct and important film.  It's a must for all lovers of cinema to experience at least once, and hopefully see again and again and again.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBience at least once, and hopefully see again and again and again. <br /> <br />--PolarisDiB

0684824906|5.0|As an open, unabashed admirer of Abraham Lincoln, the man and the legend, I initially cringed when I heard about this book. Not that Doris Kearns Goodwin was writing it,as her biography of LBJ was an exceptionally good political biography, but that: 1.) I had heard she would be writing a biography of Lincoln that would support Lerone Bennett's ignorant allegations and assertions that Lincoln was a \\"Racist\\" and ; 2.) Stephen Spielberg would be making hay out of it for another Hollyweird Boremunster.    Well, Spielberg is still considering making that film, using Liam Neeson to play Lincoln which is just totally absurd when Sam Waterston has done the role before and would be the absolute best man to play the role of Abraham Lincoln. So in that regard I am still cringing. As for \\"Team of Rivals\\" however, it is a brilliant book not only concentrating on Lincoln the political person (leave the great biographies of our 16th President to Carl Sandburg and David Herbert Donald), but how he managed to forge a brilliant team of people who haughtily considered themselves above and beyond Lincoln's acumen, namely William Seward, considered to be the political fox of his time; the devious Salmon P. Chase, and Edward Bates. How they were transformed into \\"Lincoln's Men\\" - to paraphase the titles of books by both William C. Davis and Donald, is the foci of Ms. Goodwin's lengthy work.    As for the fear that this book would describe Lincoln as a Racist, well, gentle reader, please check this out on page 207.     \\"There is no way to penetrate Lincoln's personal feelings about race.There is, however the fact that armies of scholars, meticulously investigating every aspect of his life, have failed to find a single act of racial bigotry on his part. Even more telling is the observation of Frederick Douglass, who would become a frequent public critic of Lincoln's during his Presidency; that of all the men he had met,  Lincoln was \\"the first great man that I had talked with in the UnitedStates freely, who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color\\".    I hope Lerone Bennett gets beyond his hangups and reads this book.    Goodwin must have poured through every ancedote, every quip. every commentary, journal or book on Lincoln, but also on these men who thought they were better than Honest Abe, but gradually not only yielded to his leadership, but, especially in the cases of Stanton (who called Lincoln an \\"ape\\") and Seward, became open admirers of him.     Although much briefer than I had hoped, Ms. Goodwin manages to convey how Lincoln, following John Pope's bad beating at Second Manassas, could reinstate the extremely discredited George McClellan as commander of the Army of the Potomac. Those who initially supported McClellan, and that was practically the entire cabinet with the exception of Lincoln wanted to hang the man. Lincoln, knowing how useless McClellan was, but also knowing the army was still loyal to him, saw that he was the only hope at that point to save Washington,D.C. from Confederate occupation. Accordingly he overcame administration opposition, got a controversal victory at Antietam that led directly to the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, and when McClellan got the \\"slows\\" again - dismissed him once and for all - and had the entire cabinet behind him.    I am still getting into the book, so this review may be edited in the future, but my initial reaction is that not only is this book a winner and a remarkably readable look at Lincoln's political life, but it belongs alongside the Sandburg volumes; the Donald Biography, and Davis' \\"Lincoln's Men\\" in any Lincoln admirer's bookshelf. Make No Mistake - This is solid, well-crafted, well-researched, but extremely readable history. I only wish that Ms. Goodwin listed a full bibliography of her sources, as I did recognize some names of authors that she cited(including that of my friend Dr. Harry Jaffa) but hoped tosee a list.

B000AARKO4|3.0|I've had a stuffy nose and head cold all week and I didn't want to watch anything too serious.  Some people would reach for a romantic comedy at this time.  Not me.  To me, there is nothing like a silly swashbuckler with a big theme, huge battle scenes, and a bit of romance.  This 2005 film, Kingdom of Heaven, met that goal perfectly.  All I had to do was sit back and watch heroes and villains and lots of pomp in a rather contrived story about good and evil.  And whether the film is historically accurate or really happened this way makes little difference.  After all, the only reason I was watching it was so I could sit back, relax and kill a few hours before going to bed.<br /><br />The film is set in the 12th century and it's about Muslims and Christians fighting for control of Jerusalem.  Orlando Bloom is cast as the young blacksmith in France who is the illegitimate son of a knight, played by Liam Neeson.  He teaches his son to fence and to be honorable and then gets murdered.  The young man now has his quest in front of him.  He will go to Jerusalem and fight for the forces of good.  Of course there are challenges along the way - like getting shipwrecked in desert (yes, the desert) and saving the life of an Arab who we all know will show up later in the film.  The king of Jerusalem is Christian and is trying to keep peace in the land.  However, he is dying of leprosy and soon there will be a fight for his throne. He has a beautiful sister though, played by Eva Green.  Alas, though, she is married to a Christian bad guy.  And after Orlando Bloom falls in love with her,  he refuses to have her divorce the bad guy and marry him because he feels it is wrong.  She's a terrible actress but she has beautiful blue eyes and wears great costumes.  The one romantic scene surely could pass any censor.  Maybe that's because the producers wanted to attract a Muslim audience.<br /><br />Anyway, the film plays out as I expected.  It's very politically correct and tries to show that the fighting was more about personal power than religion.  Jeremy Irons is cast as the good king's advisor.  He's a good actor as were most of the others.  There was good cinematography too.  But the battle scenes were very similar to every other battle scene I've ever seen.  And the story seemed to lack an electric charge.  I did like it though because it kept my interest.  But it really is boring.

038572179X|5.0|This prize winning 2001 British novel deserves all the praise already given to it.  Mr. McEwan is a master of detail and nuance. The characters are all introspective and we get to see their thought processes.  Every word is fascinating though, and the observations of a woman forced to her bed with migraines is every bit as interesting the war scenes which will forever be remembered by the rescue at Dunkirk.<br /><br />The book opens in the year 1935, when the central character, Briony Tallis, is just 13 years old.  The family has risen from the middle class and are quite well to do, living in a huge home in the English countryside.  They have their own lake and a large stone fountain and lots of rooms for family and guests.  Young Briony loves to write and is trying to stage a play for the family.  Her cousins are visiting and she enrolls them in the project.  But her older cousin Lola competes with her for the lead role and her young twin boy cousins are not behaving well.  She suddenly abandons the project though because she has observed her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie, the son of one of the servants engaged in an act she just doesn't understand.  Then, later that evening, when she discovers that he has written her sister an obscene letter, her imagination takes over.  And this is where she does something that will affect the whole family for generations to come.<br /><br />Briony is central to the narrative.  And in spite of her impulsive act which was absolutely wrong and misguided, I felt I understood her completely. Years later she realizes what she did and tries to atone.  But that is not so easy.<br /><br />A few years later, War comes to England.  This section is written from the point of view of Robbie, who is a soldier at one of the first battles.  We get to know him well too, and understand every emotion he feels, especially his anger toward Briony.  That's because her impulsive act has changed his life forever.  We also get to experience the war as he experiences it, including his fatigue and hunger and hope of survival as the bombs burst around him and he struggles to get to safety.  I felt I knew him too as I experienced the war through his eyes.<br /><br />By this time Briony is a nurse.  And this chapter about what it was like for these nurses in London is extremely moving.<br /><br />Years later, in 1998, Briony is an elderly novelist.

0786715103|5.0|The book starts with his early childhood upbringing and rising in the ranks as an officer; he came from a French-speaking working class family (his father was a WWII vet).  At the beginning of this book you realize that moving up the military ladder (specifically becoming an officer from a blue-collar family) was almost an impossible task; so, his level of dedications were remarkable.  Add to that burden, is being part of the French-speaking minority in the back-then (circa 1960's) Canadian Army. <br /> <br />The book goes through the events and many continuous attempts-successes he made before-during-after the genocide.  The book also gives glimpses into mutilations and scenes of the Rwandan genocide. <br /> <br />The book ends with him asking why he was chosen (a Cold War peacekeeping general) to this form of chaotic mission.  To me, he was chosen by a higher power (however you would like to define it) because of the level of dedications that were engrained in him from an early start and being a minority (whether a Canadian Francophone or a Tutsi minority, the only thing that distinguishes them within their own nation can be as simple as an accent or an identification card).   <br /> <br />I don't know how much of a difference would have been made, if there was another general with more of a Gung-Ho attitude was in his place (so he would have confiscated the weapons cache, locations given by the informant to the UN prior to the genocide, whereas Dallaire went with strict UN orders of not confiscating them).  If this event was inevitable (because of World's apathy), perhaps his presence-compassion-understanding was the best chosen. <br /> <br />It is too easy to sit in a cozy room in the U.S. and type this opinion about such a horrific & merciless event; the only reason that I dared to express an opinion was in his defense.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|The only thing I can review about this album is the unexcusable absence of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\\" Other than that, what bad things can you say about a hour of some of the best, brightest, boundary-shattering rock music ever committed to tape? You can't. ANYONE who thinks they have a smidgen of taste will have this in their collection.
B00000I2UC|4.0|pop songs layered with a glossy sheen of beautiful hazy distortion. the Reid brothers oozed effortless cool and icy cold detatchement, but these songs flow with a warm touch and an obvious love for pure melody. the music could be described as a cross between the Velvet Underground meets ZZ Top. there's lots of noise and wild guitar feedback piled ontop of cool and confusing vocal lines like this excerpt from album opener, \\"Here Comes Alice\\" : \\"don't let your life be the butt of a joke, get your lips 'round a cool black pepsi coke.\\" but when he sings it... you don't care, because you know it sounds right.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|In a year of great metal releases, this one stands easily in the upper echelon.  This is my first exposure to A7F, so I don't have any historical bias - only my opinion.  I must preface by saying I am not a fan of the \\"death rattle\\" lyrics; I just can't relate to them.  If that is what A7F was prior to this release, mixed with double-kick rhythms - RIP and good ridance, because that stuff sucks; it's not even music - get over it. <br />     This album has so many pluses within it, I don't know where to begin.  The writing is very strong, the rhythms excellent, and the soloing phenominal.  In parts, the soloing is so good, borderline shredding - yet within the context of the song.  The vox is excellent - I surely hope this cat does not go back to the cookie monster vocals, because he really does shine in his clean registers.  A few song choruses are a bit sing-song, but who cares, the remainder of those songs, and music kick ass. <br />     This sort of music has become a lost art.  Long, complete songs telling a story, with tasteful bridges, and blistering solos.  I don't think any one song is under five minutes, with a few over seven.  The guitar work is a reminiscent decadent mixture of the styles of Slash (GNR), Dave Mustaine and crews, Adrian Smith, and Vinnie Moore.  There is not a better bang for the classical metalhead buck (75 frickin' minutes worth?) this year. <br />     If nothing else, this album is an awesome tribute to Guns & Roses, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, and every other power thrash band out there.  Horns up!
B0000793X6|4.0|well...i must admit that i've been a bit humbled by the listening experience of the Epica album. i used to make fun of these guys alot because they are kinda easy targets. i mean...the swords and castles (that aren't real anyway...unlike the old Enslaved albums where those guys actually brandished their armour...hehe), but they are just one of those bands that have the most unflattering band photo shots. almost worse than those Immortal pictures from the At The Heart Of Winter album. basically, these guys just look like dorky monkeys who try and strike cool dramatic poses, but come across more like lucky nerds who managed to get away from the Star Trek convention in time to form a band and record an album. and the humorous horror only gets worse when you see the band member's close up photos inside the booklet...oh god, no! make it stop! but thankfully, i didn't let the ugly mugs hold me back from checking out Kamelot's music. and i'm glad that i gave it a chance. this is really strong power metal that is both progressive in it's structure, and very restrained and mature in it's delivery. Khan's vocals are very smooth and in the Geoff Tate vein...he never goes overboard with too much pomp and bombastic high notes...keeps it all within his range and it gives these songs a great level-headed feel. the music is technical and is full interesting instrumental passages that showcase each member's talent but the songs never feel under seige from showboating techniques. this is a highly recomended power metal album that most hard rock fans would probably also enjoy. and as a little bonus, you can even have a chuckle or two looking at the photos.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is one of the greatest records of all time. 80's metal fans should already own it.
B00003CWRX|5.0|If you're looking for a riveting movie that will keep you glued to your set through the entire performance, this is it. <br />Pacino and crowe are at their best as the two men take on two corporate giants. <br />
0321334876|5.0|This book is well written. Meyers explains many C++ details that are either badly explained or not explained at all in other books. His focus is always on productive and practical techniques and he doesn't sit on the fence: he gives you the benefit of clearly well thought out advice. If you want to understand C++ better and if you want to understand the design trade offs, for example, between inheritance,  aggregation, and templates, this is a good place to look for help. This is one of those rare books that you will want to read more than once---as well as to refer to regularly. Highly recommended.
B000055Y0X|4.0|I'm 60, and lived through these times. This movie is a whole lot funnier now that the \\"cold war\\" is over.
B0006L5RT2|4.0|I got this CD as a gift.<br />Some good songs, try it out you may like it<br />I haven't seen much latest from the artist though
0380789035|2.0|This book is derivative and meandering.  The idea that human belief literally creates and sustains deities is not original.  Gaiman's uses this idea in an ambitious attempt to write a fantasy novel that is also a detailed commentary on the role of belief and values in American life.  While he deserves credit for trying hard, this book is not very succesful.  The quality of writing, including plotting, characterization, and satire, is mediocre.  Gaiman's social commentary is conventional.  The idea is good and with considerable editing and rewriting, this could have been a decent book.
B000002MFE|5.0|First of all, I would like to encourage all to buy this album. Very rarely does one get to hear and feel the emotion of an artist like Unplugged offers. This album has it all, and is a must buy for all music lovers. Theres no hard core rock, classical music, but just one man making brilliant music. Clapton is at his sublime best and shows his true genious as both a live performer but also as a muscian. Now to the Songs. <br /> <br />1. Signe- This is the intro Song. Claptons relaxing voice won't be heard in this song, yet it sets the tone for a wonderful night of music. <br /> <br />2. Before You Accuse Me- Truly a brilliant song. The Crowd's clapping mixes in the song harmoniously and Claptons voice graces the song. A great guitar part accompanies the song. Simply Brilliant. <br /> <br />3. Hey, Hey- Catchy Guitar Tune, but the song seems a little to repetitive. However great buildup songs for track number 4. <br /> <br />4. Tears in Heaven- Probably one of the greatest songs of all time, Clapton performs it as only he could. In this touching tribute to his son, Conor, Clapton pours his emotions into his guitar. The Crowd's applause after the song is the icing on the already perfect cake. <br /> <br />5. Lonely Stranger- Sounds very moving. Clapton at his best. <br /> <br />6. Nobody Knows You When You Are Down and Out- One of my favorites. The Songs has a very \\"cool\\" feel to it. A very hummable tune. After hearing it once don't be surprised to find yourself humming the tune everywhere you go. <br /> <br />7. Layla- They say that Genius Loves Company. The first Layla was Genius, the second might be better. Unlike the first original, which was an instant hit, this one takes a litle adjustment. A different guitar line, but a much more cool version. One of Clapton's all time greatest works. <br /> <br />8. Running on Faith- A Beuatiful Song. It Truly transcends Clapton's emotions into a simple melody with truly beautiful lyrics. <br /> <br />9. Walking Blues- An interesting song. Not as catchy as the others but very good to listen to. Clapton plays blues like a hand fits in a glove. Sounds Great! <br /> <br />10. Alberta- One of the greatest Again. Criticism that he trys to hard is unsubstantiated and completely ludicrous. Clapton sounds unbelieveable in track number 10. The basic chorus line wraps the listener in to singing along. Great Song <br /> <br />11. San Francisco Bay Blues- Bringing back life back into the concert, Clapton pulls out a goody but oldey. The instruments seize control as the song morphs into an enjoyable song.  <br /> <br />12. Malted Milk- Blues at its finest.  <br /> <br />13. OLD LOVE- Best Song in my opinon. What a catchy tune. The Song can be split into 3 main parts. Clapton singing in his brilliant voice, then to one of the greatest guitar solos of all time, and then to an amazing piano solo to finsih it off. The solo is quintessential clapton as is the singing. Truly an amazing song and a wonderful listen. <br /> <br />14. Rollin' and Tumblin'- Catchy song, but in the end a little bit of a let down. Nevertheless appropiate ending. <br /> <br />All together don't catch yourself without this cd in this collection. You could listen to this album 100 times without getting old. Truly Genious. Great Guitar, Piano, and of course Clapton. Thats all that needs to be said. <br /> <br />9.
0316666343|5.0|\\"I was murdred on December 6, 1973.\\" Susie Salmon <br />The book The Lovely Bones an Awesome book to read. It deals with a teenaged girl who was murdered. She tells her story in heaven. She looks down on earth seeing the things she can't have anymore. Thinking that she will never have her \\"life\\" back again. Watching that earth is no longer a place for her. This struggling story ties you in with the main character, Susie Salmon. You fell her emotions and her perspectve towards the world. The author, Alice Sebold, ties you in the book and makes you ask questions like, What if that happened to me?  <br />She also makes the book unpredictable. She puts a lot of emotion into it. My least favorite part was the ending, because I wanted to keep reading the book, but it was over. Alice Seabod should have a sequel to this book.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|it took me 10 spins on my discman to really appreciate this record, yes I was really disappointed in the first 3 spins, and I thought that was it, coz the tempo of the music is so slow, the guitars are lame, so I leave it for a week, then listen to it again and again, and you know what it slowly grows on me, and just realized that its a great record though it really takes time to appreciate it, and dont compare this to fumbling or surfacing coz its a bit different though Sarah's trademark are still there with tracks like fallen, stupid, world on fire, time, perfect girl. And as always there's melancholy in Sarah's music which really fits my taste in music. Plus you also have to give credit to Pierre Marchand, Sarah's musical companion, producer since Solace, he's the one responsible why Sarah has reach these heights, the guys a genius. As long as Sarah teams up with Pierre Marchand, they will continue to release amazing records. So far Sarah Mclachlan has never disappointed me. There's a reviewer who says Sarah should retire coz its over, my answer to that is no, she shouldn't retire, in a world full of teeny bopper pop stars, we need artist like Sarah Mclachlan, for we have something good to listen to.    Some Tips: the best way to appreciate this record is through a headphone, coz there are tracks here that are slow and lame that its preferable to listen to it through a headphone, and youll hear those beautiful and heavenly relaxing atmospheric tunes.....
B000059H99|5.0|I remember walking out of the theater dazed when I saw the original Rocky in its first run back in the day.  The power of the story and its overwhelming sweetness against such a brutal background left me almost as punch drunk as the character on the screen.  The movie hasn't lost its appeal -- it is still sweet and gritty and powerful and encouraging and its theme of never give up still rings true.  I highly recommend it (and its sequels...yes, even number five!).  Don't miss this incredible film.
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbs was one of the greatest comics of all time. This collection starts with a forward by Bill Watterson that reveals behind the scene information on how the comic came into existence and how it progressed. Calvin's childhood exploits with his stuffed tiger Hobbes revolve around mischief, school and his fantastic adventures, both real and imagined.  <br /> <br />The $94 dollar price tag is well worth it--the three volume set lays out every comic in the order published with the dates of publication, and the quality of the paper and covers are top notch, as is the printing and coloration. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|Oh man, can this band get any better?  I mean come on; U2 has been rockin out the world since I was a little tot and they still are kicking it pretty strong.  I saw them in concert twice this year and they played a majority of the songs off of this album, and they  were some of the best in the set.  However, I'm still a child of the classics such as With or Without You and New Year's Day, but How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is still a great album that any U2 fan, or fan of music for that matter, should pick up.  BOOYA!!
B000069KE0|4.0|Chicago made three decent albums and then went downhill fast after the death of their best songwriter. The \\"Make Me Smile\\" suite is a highlight, as are \\"Fancy Colours\\" and the other single, \\"25 or 6 to 4.\\" (Hey, it only took me 15 years to get that this song is about a guy who's awake at 3:34 or 3:35 a.m.) I also liked the closer (of the original record), \\"Where Do We Go From Here?\\"  But in retrospect that songs sounds a little too much like their future singles, most of which are abominations on the face of the earth. Anyway, get this if you want a little meat to go with your cheese.
B000AA4LAK|5.0|One of the best albums of the year! Excellent melodies combined with honest guiter playing and lyrics. I only hope they come around NJ/NYC again soon.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|For those like me who found Playing the Angel to be severely lacking, on its own merits, and especially when compared with their earlier efforts, go easy on the band, they're just suffering from what all the bands & singers we 30 something's have grown up with are suffering from now. They aren't young any more, they aren't hungry any more, they aren't hip any more, they aren't angry and vital any more. The people in the bands we loved, if they are still playing, are somewhere between 35 to 65. These people don't want to rock and roll all night and party every day any more. Their metabolisms have slowed down, so they can't live on scotch and cheeseburgers without blowing up like Rosie O'Donald. They've lost their taste for life in the fast lane, and their writing, and singing and performing reflects it. There are exceptions to this, REM and U2 somehow have managed to stay vital and continue to produce quality material album after album, don't ask me how. Depeche, sadly, falls into the category of the fighter that doesn't know when to hang up the gloves. But, if record companies continued to offer me contracts, and people kept buying the albums and the concert tickets, I can't say as I can blame them for continuing to take the $$$. I previewed the album on Rhapsody, and downloaded John the Revelator. Pretty good song. The rest of it is utterly forgetable, and I will.
B000B7HZXM|3.0|The formula for these CDs is simple and it works.  Sing beautiful love songs from eras past and you can't go wrong.  Rod can keep putting these out for another ten years.  What upsets me is that the total time for this CD is only 43 minutes.  A CD can hold up to 80 minutes worth of material.  43 minutes is a tease and it's cheating the public.  With so many classic songs available another three or four would have made this perfect.  That's what's keeping me from giving it more than 3 stars.
B000AU9UYM|1.0|LET ME GET ONE THING STRAIGHT, IT ISN'T ONE STAR, BUT 0. THIS WAS THE WORST PIECE OF TRASH BATMAN I HAVE EVER SEEN. OKAY, IN ALL THE BATMAN MOVIES, THERE IS AN AUTHENTIC BATMAN VILLIAN, THERE ISN'T IN THIS ONE. AND, WHEN YOU FIND OUT THAT THE SCARECROW IS IN IT, IT IS A TOTAL RIP OFF. I MEAN, THIS JERK PUTS ON A SCARECROW MASK, AND SAYS BOO. WOW, REALLY FRIGHTENING. AT LEAST THE JOKER WAS A MOBSTER, MR. FREEZE HAD HIS FREEZY GUN, ETC. THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER MADE THIS MOVIE. BATMAN AND ROBIN WAS THE BEST ONE YET, THEY SHOULD HAVE CONTINUED IT THAT WAY. AND ANOTHER THING, PEOPLE ARE LIKE I HOPE THEY MAKE A BATMAN BEGINS 2. THINK ABOUT IT, IT THIS IS WHERE HE BECOMES BATMAN, AND AT THE END YOU FIND OUT THEY PICK UP WITH THE ORIGINAL, THERE CAN'T BE A BATMAN BEGINS 2. IF ANYONE WOULD EVEN WANT TO MAKE ONE, THEY SHOULD BE SHOT IMMEDIATLY. PASS UP THIS PIECE OF TRASH, AND WATCH THE BEST BATMAN: BATMAN AND ROBIN.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This movie is wonderful!  A few scenes' with Hugh Grant towards the end of the movie get pretty sappy, but the rest of the story lines are so great you are able to overlook.   I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B00005V1WO|1.0|First of all, the only reason I started watching this movie was because my roommate got it and we're both lovers of the Romantics. The only reason I kept watching this movie after the first 5 minutes was because I could already tell it was going to be completely and totally awful and would make for a few good laughs between the two of us.  <br />Beyond some very basic facts about the party of writers, this movie is not grounded anywhere in reality. The acting is way overdone and quickly becomes grating. There is no plot whatsoever to speak of and the movie lacks any sense of clear direction or purpose -- it is simply a collection of random, inexplicable, and nonsensical events filled with frenzied sexuality, animalism, and vaguely-defined hallucinations. While I'm sure the actual experience was not entirely tame and prudish, I find it hard to believe that this is anywhere close to being accurate. Even when it tries to delve into pseudo-philosophical discussion about the nature of love, fear, poetry etc., that you would expect to emerge among these great literary figures (which, strangely, does not happen often)it utterly fails to make any understandable conclusions or statements and their real views, beliefs, and visions become hysterical ravings rather than the passionate philosophies that they were. <br />The film does not deal fully at all with Mary's creation of the Frankenstein story, nor do any of the other characters write ghost stories as Byron challenges them and as really took place. The idea that the story was born out of Mary's personal fears is an interesting one but this too spirals out of control and has almost nothing to do with Frankenstein.  <br />The premise behind this disaster of a movie is a good one and I think with the right script, actors, and director it could be an amazing exploration of authorship, literary exploration and exchange, and this fascinating group of writers. That is not, however, what this film is.  <br />P.S. If you do get seduced by the other reviews, pay particular attention to the scenes in the billiard room...I didn't know they had light bulbs in 1816!
B000B2YQX4|4.0|This is easily Depeche Mode's best album since 1993's Songs of Faith and Devotion.  Playing the Angel however, is a tale of two albums.  The first half is terrific, songs like A Pain That I am Used to and Precious belong side vintage mode like Never Let Me Down and Enjoy the Silence.  Once you get to Martin Gore's Macro however, this album goes off the tracks.  The last Song, The Darkest Star is extremely solid.  A good soild effort by Depeche Mode and I can't wait to see them in Montreal in December.
B0007P3582|1.0|If you are a 13 year old white kid from suburban Ohio, Colorado, California, or any other rich neighborhood and you think it's \\"tight\\" to get shot, buy this album. But for all the folks that have been through the 'hood life, or had your childhood friends killed in front of you, you know that cats like 50 portray an imaginary glory in the nightmare of urban life in the U.S. Not only could I spend an hour explaining why 50 Cent's claims to his gangsta status don't have any facts to support them, but I wonder why people buy into this. I openly admit that I even wrote a review talking about wishing you could commit a violent crime, but that doesn't mean that I am gonna preach to media-brainwashed kids that this is the life to live. I listen to songs with content about murders, drugs, and sex everyday. I smoke weed and know a thing or two about pistols. But this album makes me sick. The ridiculously fake gangsta talk makes me wanna laugh and cry at the same time. If Curtis Jackson was what he sells himself as, he wouldn't have 8 bodyguards and a bomb-proof car. This album is almost like a parody of itself, please don't waste your money.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|I was hoping for a better album than ULTRA because they are due for one but sadly, this is not that album.  I kept waiting for the powerful songs to start and was sadly disappointed.  There are a few good songs but not to be considered an album that I would keep.  I loved \\"Songs of Faith Love and Devotion\\" and their older stuff.  If this is the way DM is moving I will stop buying their stuff. <br />

B000AM4PBS|3.0|I think is great you can get all 10 seasons together, but I don't think is fair for all of us that bought the first nine for a lot of money that you can get it now for $200 plus a collector's box, sure I got to see them before, but for me, I feel I got screwed, anyway for all of you buying the collector's box do it it's a real bargain

B000021YQV|4.0|i'm a new soad fan. i usually listen to bands like Metallica, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and I always had this feeling SOAD and Korn are just about in the same league, and never bothered to listen to any of their songs, till i stumbled upon Violent Pornography off their latest album. Then I listen to Toxicity album, and i was in for a treat. System of a Dawn is not your usual Korn-like band. When I dug a little deeper, I found out what these guys are all about, and their music is trying to send a totally different message than a shallow listener might think. Not to ignore the musical bit, they have more melody in their songs than I'd ever expected. <br />Prison Song - good opener, like the song very much, catchy <br />Needles - not a song you enjoy hearing it for the first time, but it has a certain amtosphere; not to be ignored <br />Deer Dance - one of my favorite off this album, powerfull, good bass line, good lyrics, and very very catchy :) <br />Jet Pilot - don't like it, too violent without any substance. Repeting riffs. I jumped every 20 seconds of it, and it's pretty much the same thing all the way through <br />X - think this was actually a album-filler song <br />Chop Suey - great guitar work, but i find it too loud and fast compared to the chorus. could have kept it a bit more melodic <br />Bounce - pretty short and energetic <br />Forest - favorite song, good guitar work, strong lyrics <br />ATWA - melancholic, with a good certain edge to it <br />Science - it's motive for bein on the album it eludes me to some extent <br />Shimmy - too repetitive, yet I like it, it breaths energy :) <br />Toxicity - good guitar, good lyrics, complex, atmospheric, great song <br />Psycho - very good song, a good balance between message and music, beat and melody <br />Aerials - could call it comercial, I just find it awsome, the vocals on it are great
1400034779|5.0|An enchanting book, a real pleasure to read, which totally deserves the plaudits heaped upon it.  Apart from the remarkable protagonist, Precious Ramotswe, and her succession of interesting cases, I particularly appreciated:    1.  The beautiful setting:  Central Southern Africa - running all the way down the eastern side of Botswana from Bulawayo to Mafikeng and on to Johannesburg in neighbouring South Africa.  The book really makes this local topography come alive and gives an evocative picture of the whole area.    2.  The wonderful idiom of the speakers and the conversations.  Alexander McCall Smith has caught the local flavour of character, motivation, and speech so well - it's a privilege and a learning experience to \\"listen in\\".    3.  The human suffering, which lends a three-dimensionality and depth to the characters.    Precious Ramotswe herself sets up her agency after a troubled marriage and motherhood.    A retrospective describes the suffering of Precious's father in the Jo'burg diamond mines.  The bosses there, says author McCall Smith, speak Funagalo.  \\"...there are many Zulu words in it, but it is not Zulu.  It is a language which is good for telling people what to do.  There are many words for push, take, shove, carry, load, and no words for love, or happiness, or the sounds which birds make in the morning.\\"  [This soulless communication has been extended to the concept of 'Office Funagalo' - check the Web.]    4.  Concept of freedom.  Almost all of Precious's cases involve some kind of liberation.    Beautifully nuanced, clever, humorous, moving - highly recommended.

192076920X|5.0|This is one book you will never forget. having been in india it brought me right back there in an instant- It really isnt much about drugs or crime at all but a bulging outlook on life, some people do have these kind of lives, these things do happen especialy in the magic that is india, and it takes you right into the heart of the indian people and the poetic heart of a man who on the surface is a hardend criminal. Stupendous, Best book i have ever read. Would love to meet the man.
0553565915|3.0|Wonderful book, its message is one of acceptance, love and compassion. Not for the rigidly dogmatic.  Good for someone who is grappling with the notion of fearful death or in mourning.
B00000I07P|5.0|Wow. I as lucky enough to see Bon Jovi in concert in Atlanta twice in th 80s and this tape takes me right back to that time. I can almost hear the crowd and see Jon with his big hair running accross the stage. The sound is so much better than the cassett tape that ive had some 20 years now. I can still be seen running the streets with the stereo blasting  Bon Jovi, singing along because I know all the words. This is my history, My generation of GREAT music. thanks BON JOVI!
B000089CJI|5.0|At first listen the Postal Service sounds like a sort of gimmick. But unlike other electronica influenced projects, the Postal Service is surprisingly musically and lyrically mature. The melodies are addictive and the rhythms are intoxicating. The layers in the programmed tracks are very well put together and mesh to create a wonderfull tapestry of texture, rhythms, sounds and chordal pads. The tambre changes constantly giving the songs a sense of variety and good taste. The one word that I would use to describe the album is that it is very intelligent. Everything seems to be well thought out and considerately put together.<br /><br />The best thing about this disc is Ben Gibbard's lyrics. They stand alone as beautiful poetry and when they are put to Jimmy Tamborello's relaxing, smooth electronic music, the absolute beauty of this great collaboration really shines through. Every track is a stand out. However, the three best reasons to buy this disc are \\"Sleeping In\\" \\"Clark Gable\\" and \\"Brand New Colony.\\" It almost doesn't seem fair to single those three out as the best.
0393317552|1.0|I purchased this book before vacation based on a recoomendation of a friend.  We obviously have very different tastes in books.  I found the book extremely dry and tedious, with no interest to me at all.<br /><br />Counting on the fact that different people have different tastes, I left the book on a chair at the Philadelphia airport for someone to find and hopefully appreciate.  I was not about to lug it around Europe for 2 weeks.
B000AU9UYM|2.0|Batman Begins would've been a better movie had it been it's own original character.  Although comical at times and the constant changing lead actors playing Batman (i.e. Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer & George Clooney), the consistency was there.  Batman Begins and doesn't quite offer an insight as to what you're watching.  Is he in Tibet?  Okay, halfway in you find out why he was locked up.  Batman Begins tried to be darker than it was.  The unimpressive BatMobile (Hummer, dune buggie dragster fusion).  Maybe the new generation of kids will enjoy this.  But as a new twist on Batman, 2 stars.  As a standalone hero, Begins would deserve maybe 4 stars.
1400032717|5.0|This is quite an incredible book.  I do not know Mr. Haddon's background but I suspect that he must have some experience in dealing with autistic children.  There is no way he could write such a stellar and accurate book without this knowledge.  Having had a great deal of experience with autistic people personally, I can vouch for the accuracy of this author in portraying the social behaviors and characteristics associated with autism. <br /> <br />Mr. Haddon certainly has a gift for telling a great story.  More importantly he can tell this story while being bounded by character development and staying true to the condition of autism.  What is most rare, perhaps, is that Mr. Haddon can make us feel so strongly for Christopher, even though Christopher himself is unable to deal with the rest of us.  <br /> <br />This is a book I recommend without hesitation.  <br /> <br />
B00005M08C|5.0|Great condition with the extras. This was just what I was looking for at a reasonable price.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a Joss Whedon fan. For some odd reason, I never watched Firefly when it was on Fox. I have no excuse. I was watching Buffy & Angel and loved 'em. So why not Firefly? I think mostly because I never really heard much about it and never knew when it was on...It seemed like the network DIDN'T want me to see it...<br /><br />Well, the Sci-Fi Channel fixed that.  With the impending release of the movie \\"Serenity\\" (An excellent film adaptation!! I'm pre-ordering the DVD) the episodes were rebroadcast by SF Channel. My wife and I caught them and we were hooked.<br /><br />This show is pure Joss. The great characters, intriguing situations, and of course witty dialogue. You can feel the love of the material in the craftsmanship of everyone involved - writers, directors and actors.<br /><br />The show is accessible to everyone. Not just Joss fans. Not just Sci-Fi fans or Western aficionados. It's a great shame that the show never got the chance to really come in to its own. In the brief number of episodes you can see the development of character and story that promised to be riveting and entertaining.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Get this series. You'll be glad you did.
B00097A5I6|5.0|\\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise ordinary and crappy era in music. Oasis has grown up and moved on to bigger and better things. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely adore \\"Definitely Maybe\\" and the other earlier albums, but this album has a great retro sense to it and it does not disappoint. Some highlights: <br /> <br />\\"Part of the Queue\\" is the absolute hands down best song I have heard in 2005. Period. I was happy to see it featured in the trailer for \\"North Country\\". Too bad it isn't on the soundtrack. <br /> <br />\\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" is my second favorite song. Great lyrics, fun to sing along to. <br /> <br />\\"Turn Up the Sun\\" is also a great track. I just love it when the booming guitar comes in after a cool little intro. Good lyrics as well. Kudos to Andy Bell. <br /> <br />I won't summarize every song, but they are all good. For those of you who think Oasis is finished, go ahead and keep listening to your crappy MTV generation bands. And for my fellow Oasis fans, CHEERS!, because you know exactly what I mean when I say Oasis is back and better than ever....
B00063EMJ6|4.0|A good collection covering much of Neil's best, but missing one outstanding track. Compiling a \\"Best of\\" collection is undoubtably subjective and this should probably have been a double cd set - another notable omission is Cortez the Killer.  It may have seemed a good idea at the time to use radio airplay, singles sales, and download frequency as the main ingredients for this collection, but any \\"Greatest Hits\\" or \\"Best of\\" set without \\"Powderfinger\\" is a contradiction and a real let down.

074325144X|4.0|I got this book only last week, and I'm already experimenting with the techniques explained in it. A major positive effect is that one becomes very focused on running form, proper breathing and relaxation. \\"ChiRunning\\" basically involves running with a forward lean, letting gravity pull you forward (as the author describes it). Instead of lifting the knees, you should keep them low and lift your heels instead. Landing should be done on midfoot, and not on the heels. When running this way, you almost get the feeling of falling, which is how it's meant to work! Granted, it's a slightly unorthodox method, but I am willing to give it a try. Danny Dreyer claims that this is a more effective (less effort-demanding) way of running and that it makes you less prone to injuries, compared to what he calls the \\"Power Running paradigm\\" (the \\"no pain, no gain\\" mindset; developing muscle power to do the work). These claims aren't quite substantiated in the book, at least not scientifically, but many of the underlying principles (keeping relaxed, listening to your body, gradual progress) are quite sound. Despite the author's constant use of \\"chi\\" (which is a somewhat controversial and elusive concept), he manages to avoid becoming completely new age-y - there are lots of highly practical tips throughout the book, from exercises to loosen up tense muscles and ligaments, to a couple of creative ways to ensure that your shoelaces don't come untied! I have to admit though, that the chapter on diet had me giggling a little. \\"Getting the most chi from your food\\"? But even here, the actual advice given seems sensible: Eat lots of fruit, vegetables and grains, eat meat, fish and eggs regularly but sparingly, etc. Honestly, I'd rather go with the \\"High Chi\\" diet than the ridiculous low-carb fad suggested by Atkins and his followers! <br /> <br />ChiRunning is a nice book to add to your library of running books, even if you don't intend to change your running style as drastically as it asksyou to. It's a welcome change of tone if you've been reading sundry training books full of training schedules and pace charts. If you desperately want to break 35 minutes for the 10K or 3 hours for the maraton, you'll get a much needed reminder from Danny Dreyer to put less emphasis on externally motivated goals. Instead he tells you to \\"let your goals be an expression of who you are\\". That sentence alone made the book a worthwile read for me.
B00004XONN|3.0|Radiohead are one of the best bands of the late 20th/early 21st Century and do deserve the accolades heaped upon them to great degree - few bands in recent memory --regardless of assigned gere-- have delivered consistently great albums over a career arc spaning aprx. a decade like they have.  But, I'm sorry to say, Kid A misses the mark that OK Computer and The Bends --the two albums which immediately proceded it-- set, not because it's a departure from what was concidered their signature sound up to that point, but because it has a number of really good songs but they don't cohere together in the context of an album as well as their previous two masterpiece albums.  I appplaud the fact that they were attempting to explore new musical territory but Kid A comes off feeling like a sketchy prologue to the far-better Amnesiac which was released barely a year later.  For me, Amnesiac is what Kid A wanted to be but didn't quite acheive.
B0000009RT|5.0|Every Song is great, the most psychedelic track I think is Who Are The Brain Police? although most would say Return Of The Son Monster Magnet. Wowie Zowie is like a 40's barber shop song which is like a children's song it's fun.  Hurngry Fraks Daddy is off the hook too wow! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Anyway The Wind Blows
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is unlike anything I've ever seen.  I don't even like  \\"space\\" themed tv shows and I LOVE Firefly.  The characters are fantastic and incredibly well acted.  And, on top of it all, Joss' use of humor speaks true to life and makes this show phenomenal.  If there isn't another movie or more episodes ordered it will be a true loss for television.  MORE PLEASE!!!!!
B0000009SG|5.0|First song I ever heard by Frank Zappa was Montana and am I glad i heard that song first because everysong on this album is as good as each other just in different ways. Not one weak track one this one.  Now i'd suggest this is a essential to your collection because it's got all of the Frank Zappa elements in it.          True Music Baby Ture Music!
B000BC8TBE|5.0|The legendary Mariah Carey's updated version of Merry Christmas is nothing short of astonishing! On the second disc she updates her now classic performances from the album's original 1994 release. Her vocals are amazing and sound as good as ever as she takes these songs into the stratosphere.  Mariah's singing is inspired and she demonstrates that even after 15 years in the music business she is still reaching new highs in artistry and vocal performance.  Mariah has taken the best, and best-selling Christmas album ever made and made it BETTER!!!  With her enormous talent fully on display, Mariah delivers a CD that is her perfect way of saying \\"Merry Christmas\\" to us all.

B0000024RZ|5.0|To me Bob Dylan was always his best when he was acoustic . Not to say he isnt good electric, I just like his acoustic period better. <br />The Freewheelin Bob Dylan to me is his career album and this is a very close second. <br />The times they are a Changin kicks the album off, one of Dylans' classic songs of his career. <br />He then tells us about Hollis Brown and tells us about his poverty, and his inability to find work and how no one really cares about each other. <br />With God on our Side is one of my personal favorite Dylan songs ever. He talks about this country and its views on war. \\"And you dont count the dead when God's on our side. <br />He then talks about Civil Rights leader Medger Evers and how he was a \\"Pawn in their game\\" Showing how corrupt political leaders are in the south and other places as well. <br />Another Favorite \\"When the ship come In\\" is another solid song. <br />Dylan has always been known for war protest and civil rights awareness. I remember hearing these songs at a very early age and its strange becasue the message still applies in many ways. <br />I guess despite our technology some things never change. <br />If you are a Dylan fan this is a must.
B000B0WO0I|4.0|I've been a huge fan of Mick Hucknall's and Simply Red's since \\"Picture Book\\" debuted in 1985, so I rushed out and picked up \\"Simplified\\" the day it was released (as I have for each CD they've released in the past 20 years). <br />The first track, the high-energy, rhythm-infused \\"Perfect Love,\\" is a new song on an album made up mostly of favorite SR songs revisited. The song inclues some spectacular guitar work and additional vocals from Cuba's Danae and the SR girls, Sarah Brown and Dee Johnson.  It is absolutely brilliant. So is, in my opinion, \\"A Song for You\\" (not a new song, but new to SR) which is goosebump-inspiring and just the perfect song for Mick to sing at this point in his career and his life.  <br />The other new song on the album is \\"Smile,\\" which fans know was inspired by Mick's new love, and is indeed, sung with tremendous passion. Not a favorite song of mine, but there's no disputing the quality of Mick's voice. Like the finest of wines, it has aged very, very well. <br />The revisits, including the classic \\"Holding Back the Years,\\" along with other favorites like \\"Sad Old Red,\\" are a mixed bag. Some fare well in the new recordings and others, like \\"Fairground,\\" disappoint fans who loved the original, more rhythmic and fast-paced versions. But Mick did remind us all that this is how he chooses  to sings these songs today...not as a young, inexperienced artist, but as an older, wiser and more thoughtful singer. They are honest and heartfelt recordings. \\"Simplified\\" truly is Mick's gift to Simply Red's true-blue fans. It may not be on par with 2003's \\"Home\\" or the acclaimed and utterly stunning \\"Stars,\\" but here's a word of advice (which I've taken myself)...don't spend too much time comparing the old with the new, the slower versions with the fast. Instead, listen to these with a fresh ear, pour yourself a nice glass of red and enjoy.
B00065VTU4|3.0|461 Ocean Blvd is one of Claptons best of his career.  Motherless Children opens the album with some great slide guitar.   Better make it through today originally appeared on There's One In Every Crowd. It is an outstanding song  Willie and the Hand Jive is a remake of the old Johnny Otis song from the 50's.  Get Ready shows a funky side of Clapton with Yvonne Elliman joining him on vocals.  I Shot The Sheriff to this day is Claptons' only #1 song of his career  I Cant Hold out is another song with some slide on it. It is very laid back.  Please Be With Me is a country song he has covered.  Let it Grow is next and in my mind one of the best songs he has ever done.  Steady Rollin Man is another great song with some great guitar.  Mainline Florida is a rocker written by George Terry who was his rythm player at the time.  Give Me Strength is one of Claptons best blues songs of his career.  I saw Eric Clapton on his 1974 tour and saw him do these recordings live.  I was surprised to see him open with \\"Smile\\" the old Charley Chaplin song, and a long time favorite of mine.  I also remember hearing Let it Grow live. They way it sounds on this CD is the way I remember hearing it back then. Clapton at this point had just come off a 3 year layoff and his guitar playing has suffered and he is good but not in top form.  Now collectors like myself have it on  record. As I said this is strictly for Collectors like me........................
B00006LFGD|2.0|I am an ardent fan of Barbra Streisand, and I always look forward to anything new that comes out from her and immediately buy whatever it is that comes out.<br /><br />But I do have to say that I think I jumped the gun in purchasing Duets.  If you are a loyal,faithful Streisand fan like me, you already have all of this material,with the exception of the 2 duets with Barry Mannilow and Josh Groban, neither of which really blew me away and sound like they were added to justify the release of a CD with 95% recycled material...<br /><br />So, I do have to question the motive of Duets.  Was this album done simply so that Barbra could have a Duets album like Frank Sinatra did and his album did extremely well?  If so, this was definitely misguided, since the reason Frank Sinatra's first Duets album did do so well was because all of the material, although they were old standby's of Frank's, were re-recorded with other artists which made the album an event in and of itself... even if none of the arists actually got to sing in the studio with Frank.<br /><br />Sadly, this is not the case on Streisand's Duets akbum at all.  There was definitely no roster of talented singers brought in to re-record some of Barbra's hits with her \\"Duet-style\\"... If that were the case, then this album would have been awesome...I can only imagine what it would have been like to hear her do a duet of Evergreen with Luther Vandross or a do a duet of Memory with Andrea Bocelli...you get the picture...<br /><br />So, I must give this CD a low rating just based upon the premise being completely off-base...  The material is great and this CD may be good for a new Streisand fan who only wants to hear her previoulsy recorded duets, but I don't really see a reason why the record company could not have included the new duets with Manillow/Groban on other forthcoming albums.

0375815260|5.0|Charlie Bucket is one person that will stay on my mind for a long time. The way he is described makes me want to be just like him. From his not so greedy ways to how grateful he is for what little food his parents can give him. It makes me very happy how his luck changes when he is granted the most awesome prize of all time. Roald Dahl makes this a great story in so many ways. From what happens to the five children to how crazy Willy Wonka is. From the way the Chocolate Factory is managed by Ooompa-Loompas. To how Willy Wonka won the hearts of children all over the country, manipulating them to buy his chocolate for a oh so special golden ticket. I am not surprised that this book is talked about from generation to generation.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Unlike most DM fans, Ultra happens to be my favourite DM album [but Violator does come in a close second]. I remember listening to Exciter and wondering what had happended [wasn't horrible....but going from what I think is their best album...to their worst...well it makes one wonder]. <br /> <br />So I was ectastic when I heard Playing The Angel. This album is great. Dave Gahan wrote three tracks, all of which are among the album's best. Plus, even though the album is in many ways quinessential DM [dark, layered, strong lyrics, and of course, their quirky use of synths and sound effects], they've made the songs far more uptempo, which makes this album one of their best in my opinion.  <br /> <br />There are 1 or 2 so-so tracks, but on the whole, these guys have shown that despite being old fogies in the music world, they're coming out with material that only a handful of new artists could touch.

0767817478|5.0|Much to surprise,the American Godzilla Film has made much money than its Japanese counterparts,and it shows.Its also the first to sport the CGI Godzilla look,and finally,we have some great acting,Grade A effects,and a nice plot twist to boot.I love the Japanese Godzillas,but most of them were cheesy sequels,horrendous monster fights,and horrible effects,Even Godzilla 2000 looked like it was stuck in the 80s.This Godzilla movie also makes Godzilla seem more like a animal rather than a force to be reckoned with,but still,Hollywood exaggerates and makes it a an enemy of humanity.This film looked like the start of a new Godzilla series,an American Godzilla series,for the closing shot revealed to us an opening for a sequel,hoever,its been 7 years and no sequel,and the film did good at the box-office.An awesome film,more mindless popcorn adventure,but still has emotional values and makes you feel sorry for Godzilla.
B00005JNJV|3.0|As much as I wanted to love the newest incarnation of Batman, especially under the direction of the sharply talented Christopher Nolan, there is a gnawing imbalance to the film that makes the overall experience less than enthralling to me. In what looks obviously like the start of a new franchise, the 2005 movie spends an inordinate amount of time on the myth creation, and the first hour feels so solemn and methodical that the more interesting second hour or so in Gotham City feels rushed and telegraphed with arcane explanations of panic-inducing hallucinogens.<br /><br />The problematic pacing makes the 141-minute running time seem interminable when it needs to sprint. The movie then ends almost too quickly for the dense plot that Nolan and co-writer David S. Goyer present in sometimes frustratingly cryptic strokes. Although they provide moments of deadpan humor reminiscent of \\"The Terminator\\" films, what is missing is the satirical sense and ironic nihilism that Tim Burton brought to the 1989 and 1992 Batman films. At the same time, Nolan imbues a true focused sense of dramatic purpose and atmosphere to his treatment that easily eclipses the subsequent Joel Schumacher movies.<br /><br />Fortunately, Christian Bale is ideally cast in the title role primarily because he is an actor who emits a searing presence by not divulging too much about his interior life.  That is exactly the quality needed to portray a loner driven by the horrific murder of his parents to penetrate the criminal mind and then ironically become a reluctant, clandestine hero. Under his cowl, he takes on Clint Eastwood's raspy vocal inflections to add to his mystique, and he brings a sinewy intelligence and quiet reserve to the conflicted millionaire Bruce Wayne. The combination works.<br /><br />With a virtual Who's Who of A-listers, the supporting cast is almost too overwhelming to utilize their individual talents effectively. In a rather dastardly variation on his Jedi Master in \\"Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace\\", Liam Neeson plays Henri Ducard, another intimidating mentor who this time, acts as an operative for a ninja vigilante group trained somewhere in the Himalayas. Neeson exhibits a palpable sense of malice in the role, though his character's return late in the film has a foreboding sense of predictable inevitability about it.<br /><br />Gary Oldman, who usually specializes in screen villains, does an about-face and with genuine goodwill, plays put-upon Lt. Jim Gordon, who will become Gotham City's police commissioner someday. In his usual impeccable form, Morgan Freeman portrays Lucius Fox, the brilliant staff scientist at Wayne Enterprises who invents Batman's wardrobe and gadgetry. As Wayne's manservant Alfred, Michael Caine seems to be enjoying the humorous asides and unyielding British sense of duty in his relatively constrained role. As if he walked right off the comic-level \\"Dick Tracy\\" set, Tom Wilkinson chews a lot of scenery as the Jersey-accented crime boss Carmine Falcone.<br /><br />The normally charismatic Ken Watanabe, however, is wasted in a small role as Ra's Al Ghul, the meditative head of the ninja group spouting all sorts of incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo. Cillian Murphy turns in the film's most chilling performance as the creepy psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane, evoking the perfect portions of fear and loathing in a character that makes my skin crawl. Last and truly least, Katie Holmes fails to rise to the caliber of her cast mates as her perpetually girlish manner belies the driving conviction of an assistant D.A. struggling with her lifelong attraction to Wayne.<br /><br />The film is not as visually resplendent as previous Batmans, though the old-meets-new vision of Gotham City is compelling thanks to Nathan Crowley's impressive set designs. Also thrilling are the scary visual effects conjured up for the hallucinogens. Not as effective is Nolan's liberal use of close-ups and quick edits, especially in the numerous fightscenes sometimes impinging on the clarity of the action presented. I just wish Nolan and Goyer were not intent on overstuffing the screenplay with so many plot threads as it became a challenge to keep everything straight by the end.he action presented.

B000ASDFJU|5.0|If you're mad that they now have the complete 6 seasons in one package and you went and bought them individually do what I did; unload those great DVDs with the cheap plastic packaging (scotch taped and all) on Amazon Marketplace (you can sell them individually or sell all 6 seasons as a complete set). You'll take a loss, but with the money you'll make from the sale (between $100 and $150) you can put it toward this new set and you'll be getting more extras than you did on the old set.
B000683VI4|5.0|This has to be the best movie I've watched this year.  This is a movie so  loaded with emotion that tears still cloud my eyes as I  write this.      The story is about a couple, Noah and Allison, who, as  teenagers, discover first love.  Their love for each other  is breathtaking and it spans the entire breadth,  depth and  height of their lives.      The story is so well told that I wouldn't attempt to ruin  the movie by giving my intepretation of it here.   This  mppovie is about **true love**.  A love that fills one so  completely as to give life new meaning,  purpose and  fulfillment.      This movie will inspire those who have become jaded with  love.  In a world where heartbreak is the norm and our lives  are dominated by a perpetual emptiness punctuated by short  meaningless trists with people we *hope* are our soul  mates.      In such a world,  it's hard to believe that anyone can find  true love.  It's hard to imagine that we can actually marry  someone who we never tire of.  Seeing someone every morning   three hundred and sixty five days of the year every year   of one's life is often viewed as the ultimate chore.    That perception is far from the truth.      When one meets their better half,  their whole being is  emancipated.  Waking up everyday to see the one you love is  far from torture.  It's a welcome repreive  after walk around for years as half a person.  When your  soul mate travels or leaves for work early,  the moment you  wake up is one filled with brief ancienty and a slight  emptiness.  You ask::                   \\"Where is my other half?\\"        This movie tells that story.  The story of completion.  The   story of discovering that there is no greater purpose in   life than to spend that life dedicated to the service of   one you truly love.   To give up all you are to become who   you should be,  all through love.       The Billionaire path is one that has precious little time   to spend on that risky investment called love.  I rarelyhave time simply to go out and meet *potential soul   mates* let alone spend time with the lady that I am   truly attracted to.  This movie provides a poignant   reminder that the investment spent in search of love is not   in vain.  The journey,  and not the end,  is the reward.   For those who do find love,  they will accelerate even   faster along the Path.       This movie reassures us that True love is empowering,   motivating,  inspiring and constantly energizing.

006097625X|5.0|Scott McCloud is a world renowned artist.  In the comic <br />space,  he's synonymous with the greatest heights that comix <br />can achieve as an art form. <br /> <br /> <br />His reputation is not in vain.  *Understanding Comics* <br />is simultaneously an ode to the best of artistic design as <br />well as a thesis on self expression through comix. <br /> <br />Summary <br />-------- <br /> <br />This book spans nine chapters and provides easy reading within <br />one sitting.  From the outset,  Scott awes the reader with <br />his in depth understanding and passionate love of comics. <br />Throughout the book,  he convincingly argues that comics are <br />indeed an art form that should not be relegated to <br />children's bedside reading. <br /> <br /> <br />Scott explains all the aspects of style used in Comics.  He <br />explains the importance of good design and emphasises self <br />expression through the merging of multiple forms. <br /> <br /> <br />This book has not only changed my life,  it has changed my <br />perception and experience of life.  Scott has also managed <br />to give the world hope.  All too often we think of Design, <br />Art and Good Taste as virtues congenially bestowed upon a <br />blessed minority. <br /> <br /> <br />This book clearly shows that High Art is <br />an innate gift which has only to be developed and nurtured. <br />Within us all lies the incredible potential to build <br />beautiful things no matter what our vocation or walk of life. <br /> <br /> <br />High Art and Design <br />-------------------- <br /> <br />Personally,  I've always considered comics a high form of <br />art and a veritable record of modern mythology.  I <br />therefore did not read this book in order to understand what <br />comics are.  I read this book in order to get a different <br />perspective on that all important facet of human creativity: <br />*Design*. <br /> <br /> <br />Comix, as an art form, is difficult to fathom.  The <br />difficulty lies in the *cartoon* nature of most comics <br />as well as the typical iconography we've been exposed to. <br /> <br /> <br />To an extent,  I think much of the popular modern art <br />suffers the same fate.  We are so imbibed with the <br />superficial that we can no longer perceive the core. <br /> <br /> <br />Scott McCloud solves this problem and with one broad stroke <br />of his brush,  he wipes the fog away from the readers eyes. <br />This book is not about Comix,  it is about the evolution of <br />modern art.  It is about what modern art can evolve into. <br /> <br /> <br />The 6 Steps to Creative Expression <br />----------------------------------- <br /> <br />Every Creative expression goes through six stages:  Idea/Purpose, <br />Form, Idiom, Structure, Craft and Surface. <br /> <br /> <br />While the intricacies of each of those steps are better <br />learned by reading the book,  there's a valuable insight he <br />reveals in his discussion. <br /> <br /> <br />All too often we have to experience or learn art and design in <br />reverse order.  We first learn or are attracted to the <br />surface appearance of the Art.  Many a time this period of <br />learning coincides with the point at which our taste is at <br />an all time low. Note also that few people every progress beyond <br />this superficial appreciation of Art. <br /> <br /> <br />The reason for this is because the expressiveness of Art <br />doesn't lie in it's appearance *as such*.  The <br />expressiveness of Art lies in the *treatment* of it's <br />appearance.  This treatment then finds unity in something <br />much deeper than colour, line and shape.  The reason High Art <br />is High Art is because it possesses Qwan,  that Quantity <br />Without a Name. <br /> <br /> <br />This Qwan is what Scott seeks to impress upon the reader.  He <br />therefore proceeds to teach these 6 steps in the prescribed <br />order.  The effect of his lessons is an inside-out <br />understanding ofwhat true creative expression involves. <br />This perspective is on the opposite side of the pipe we're  <br />so used to staring down.  It is as though we thought the  <br />world was flat,  then we managed to view the planet from a  <br />spaceship! <br /> <br /> <br />Simplicity <br />---------- <br /> <br />Scott also attempts to emphasise the importance of <br />simplicity in good design.  The book's language is direct <br />and clear.  His artistic artifice is also shockingly <br />simple without be empty.  This pattern of simplicity creates such elegance <br />that it's impossible not to see the lesson:: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />     All high art and good design is simple. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />When I think about it more deeply,  simplicity in design now <br />makes perfect sense.  How can you truly have understood a <br />given topic if you can't decompose it into it's simplest <br />form just as Scott has done? <br /> <br /> <br />Conclusion <br />---------- <br /> <br />I seem to have the gift of finding and reading the best books. <br />*Understanding Comics,  The Invisible Art* is one that <br />surpasses my highest expectations. <br /> <br /> <br />This book is mandatory reading for anyone in *any <br />field* practicing *any vocation*.  Humanity's <br />greatest ills come from the inability to communicate <br />effectively with others, and most importantly,  with <br />ourselves. <br /> <br /> <br />Scott McCloud,  an artist who thinks deeply about self expression, <br />has managed to elucidate and even codify all the knowledge <br />one needs to get started.  If you have the *desire to be <br />heard*,  the willingness to *learn* and the ability <br />*to see* (which most of us also have to learn),  then <br />you are an individual who can achieve the highest levels of <br />self expression. <br /> <br /> <br />Self expression is Art and as such we can all be great <br />artists.  The rewards are exponentially greater than any <br />effort we could put in.  This is the seductive proposition <br />that Scott Mccloud's presents to us.
3937406328|5.0|I must admit I was a bit apprehensive when I heard that Chris Rea was to issue an 11 CD set.  I did not see how anyone could undertake such a huge project and hope that it would be up to his usual standard.  I really need not have feared.  Since receiving my copy of Blue Guitars at the beginning of the week I have listened to all 11 discs and have yet to find a bad one.  All the CD's are named for a particular type of blues and I have to say that they are all to a greater or lesser degree evocative of the genre they are named for. <br /> <br />If this set had been issued by somebody new to the music scene, then all the usual pundits would be lauding him.  For Chris Rea, it is his farewell and a very poignant farewell it is.  If he had never issued anything else, then this would stand as a brilliant body of work.  Taken together with all the albums issued over the last 25 years, then it is outstanding. <br /> <br />If you have never really listened to Chris Rea, then this is an opportunity to discern why he has had a faithful following over the years and why we have all looked forward eagerly to each new release. <br /> <br />Thanks for the music Chris - we will not forget the pleasure you have given us and look forward to any releases with your new band Fireflies. <br />
B0002Y69NG|3.0|More than likely this is going to be a long review so you may want to refill that drink or grab some chips.  Since I couldn't do this to the first movie and re writting this on both Reloaded and then copy/paste to revolutions so I will rant when they are all brought together.  This trilogy is nothing more than a mediochre experience that had a mind blowing start and an ending that was over the top to makeup for the content of film (if you can call it that) that is nothing more than sludge.  The Matrix (film one not the trilogy) was more about the metaphysical and the means of fighting and training as more of a means to defend rather than the focus point of the film.  I saw the first film in the theatre when I was a sophmore on monday morning I couldn't wrap my brain around the idea that perhaps the realities we create are merely illusions to the truth that we blind ourselves from.  hearing many months later that this was infact a trilogy to quote mike myers \\"I'm as giddy as a little girl\\"  The first thought to cross my mind was that this was yet another dive into the metaphysical that would challenge not only the human psyche but religious beleifs as well (you know carrying on with the same idea that the first film presented) instead I'm force fed more wire stunt fighting and action sequences that border on cheesy.  Given how many books were written on the theories presented by the first film I was under the impression that we were in for seeing something truly mindblowing not just a car chase with explosions and more fightscenes that you could see in any jackie chan movie.  Whats that? Agent Smith is back? surely he can provide some philisophical controversy that will cause the movie to cause me to think rather than take in yet more shots of people hitting other ppl.  Sadly no its the same rehash of the subway fight scene only bigger and with more CGI.  Now Onto Revolutions.  Look Kids! Another Chase Scene.  and some more senseless fightting.  OHHH and some big mechs that fire Twin machine guns  Gee this is turning out to be more like how Terminator went down rather than challenging an idea  comming up with some philisophical flaw to the machines exsistence that would provoke them to live harmoniously with the humans rather than what has become a routine clean and sweep. and what are we rewarded with in the end? any great \\"revolution?\\" from the lips of Smith Prime \\"WHY WHY WHY MR. ANDERSON!? WHY DO YOU PERSIST?\\" and of coarse Neo's reply \\"because I choose too.\\" wow feel so moved that just solved everything didn't it? well obviously Smith wasn't convinced either as he continues to pummel Neo into submission and ultimatly absorbes him.  I suppose this act is to teach him a lesson that despite all best efforts you really never can topple the machine... or can you? why you just simply get a machine that is twice as powerful and just as corrupt to pinpoint the weakness of the other machine and expunge it! wow I feel so insignificant.  I suppose if you enjoy the state of the art action scenes that were better done in Kill Bill since computers and wires weren't needed then I guess this is the series for you.  For those of whom weren't expecting brain food and nourishment instead just brain candy and just sitting there with your jaw either hung in disbeleif at how much a let down this was or how great the computer imaging was then I guess this is the trilogy for you.  If you want to save yourself the disappointment then just buy the first movie, call it good and then you can deny the exsistence of the other two movies and rent the Animatrix (some good stuff in there along with a history of just how the human greed machine got so out of control and ultimatly led to our demise) which you can later buy if you feel moved.  all in all the first was movie ground breaking with an aftershock that was at depressing on the richtor scale.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|DEAD MAN WALKING is one of the most powerful films I have seen in a long time.  In terms of pure \\"guts,\\" this film takes the cake.  Watching it just makes me wonder why Tim Robbins doesn't step up to the director's plate more often.  This film is a testament to good filmmaking: great technique, beautiful shots, outstanding performances, and the avoidance of clich&eacute;.  DEAD MAN WALKING, as its name suggests, tells the moving story of Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a nun who winds up responding to an inmate's (Sean Penn) cry for help and soon finds herself in over her head.  What follows is an emotional journey: an exploration of the death penalty that refuses (at every turn) to drop into ideology and formula.<br /><br />And let me tell you why.  Most films that deal with the philosophy behind the death penalty tend to \\"choose sides.\\"  On the one hand, the state is depicted as a fickle body that mercilessly puts innocent men to die, while the victim's families stand around and revel in watching the convicted man fry.  DEAD MAN WALKING has its share of politics and angry victims, but the victims are fleshed out, given back story, and deliver a deep emotional impact on the film.  On the other hand, the death penalty can be handled by as a necessary arm of justice, allowing us all to breathe easy at night knowing that one more killer is off the streets.  But DEAD MAN WALKING refuses to take up this line either.  Instead, the film becomes a well-balanced exploration of the issues surrounding crime and punishment.  In the end, the film evolves into an exploration of the possibility of redemption, quite apart from any issues concerning justice.<br /><br />Not enough can be said about Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn.  Their performances are simply stunning.  Sarandon plays a real nun, rather than the cardboard figure portraits of the clergy I am used to seeing in a film.  Her performance breathes and her journey allows the audience to follow her path, providing us with an emotional trajectory.  Sean Penn, once again, proves that he is pretty much the best actor working right now.  His performance is incredible.  As in most of his recent roles, you forget you're watching Penn: the character comes through.  In particular, the last twenty minutes of the film are incredibly heart-wrenching.  You just have to see the film to understand.<br /><br />DEAD MAN WALKING is a fine film and one that I don't hesitate to give five stars.  I will soon be adding it to my DVD collection.  I hope you will be too.h an emotional trajectory.  Sean Penn, once again, proves that he is pretty much the best actor working right now.  His performance is incredible.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|This series is outstanding!  What a great look at mankind's greatest technological achievement, with such a great variety of perspectives.  The quality of acting, writing, and filming are superb. <br />Thanks to Tom Hanks for taking such a terrific active role in reviving interest in the space program.  I grew up during Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo, built models of the rockets, and followed the missions.  This series brings back great memories during a tense time in our history.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|A year after george harrison died, his friend eric clapton assembled a host of musicians for a evening tribute to his late friend.    george harrison's indian/hindu connections are on display with the show opening to the reverbation of vedic chants. sitar maestro ravi shankar shares the opening address with eric clapton in a moving show of affection for \\"his son\\" harrison. his daughter anoushka begins the concert with a sitar piece dedicated to the memory of harrison. it is followed by another indian set (with vishva mohan bhatt of indian slide guitar fame being part of the indian group). eric clapton joins in with some tasteful acoustic soloing at the end of the set.     harrison's travelling wilburys bandmate jeff lyne (of ELO fame) sings most of the songs which follow. it is a wise choice and most of harrison's compositions go very well with lyne's smooth nasal vocals. From then on it is a star parade with one star friend after another trooping in to perform their favorite harrison number : clapton's emotional delivery of 'if i needed someone', gary brooker's 'old brown shoe', jools holland's rousing 'horse to the water', billy preston's soulful 'my sweet lord', tom petty's 'tax man' and the travelling wilburys number 'handle with care', joe brown's 'here comes the sun', ringo starr's 'photograph', paul mccartney's 'while my guitar ...' (clapton does NOT replicate the solo as in the studio version).    paul mccartney tries a funky 'something' which is dreadful to say the least, where clapton steps in to the rescue (after all harrison's song was directed at his then wife patti boyd, who was also clapton's 'layla') and winds it up well. the assembled musicians also play other notable harrison compositions like \\"beware of darkness\\", \\"all things must pass\\" etc.    it is a pity that the camera man can only show clapton playing rhythm, when most of the (slide) guitar parts are played beautifully by marc mann of ELO who stands in the background. that's the only negativehere.    it is a great show - once in a lifetime offering ...    GET IT!
B00004RFFS|5.0|I loved this movie.  The only downside for me was: <br /> <br />As much as I like Tom Cruise in everything I've seen him in, I can't help but wish someone more \\"Lestat\\"-like had been cast as Lestat.  Especially after seeing Stuart Townsend in \\"Queen of the Damned\\".  Now THAT was spot on. Sexy like Lestat and no bad wig. <br /> <br />But.....LOVED Brad Pitt as Louis.  He was perfect in that role. All is forgiven because of Brad Pitt portraying Louis. <br /> <br />Nice casting of Antonio Bandaras as Armand, but after reading \\"The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles, Book 6\\", too bad the actor wasn't more Northern-European-like, or at least had the curly Botticelli-like hair was a big part of Armand's character and attractiveness.   <br /> <br />The young Kirstin Dunst was a chilling Claudia.   <br /> <br />All in all, a very well done adaptation of Anne Rice's novel but...oh! for a remake with a dangerously sexy Lestat-like Lestat as most of us imagine him...
B00000099Y|5.0|This is not a album that satisfies after one listen. It took me several listens to get the greatness of this album. Certainly the best album of the 90's and 9 years later still gets airplay on the radio.Lets see Good Charlotte or Coldplay get that type of longevity. Classic album!!
B000005JA8|1.0|Pretentions wankers only need apply here.  This is the most overrated piece of drivel in the history of music (perhaps with the excpetion of Lou Reeds Metal Machine Music.  Avoid like the clap!
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is one of the few bands that simply gets better after every release. Lateralus is no exception. Just like a bottle of wine, this music gets better in time. Only band I can think of where there best songs never get any air play. Thats fine with me, because I listen to their CD often and are always impressed. A very important album and still the best of the 21st century.
B000002MJC|5.0|I've got pretty much everything DM did, from Speak and Spell to Playing the Angel, with the only exceptions being a couple live compilations and a couple singles anthologies. And this album is brilliant. I love the early stuff, and have gotten years and years of listening pleasure to just about all their material, but this one still awes me. Some of the songs sound stripped down and simple, eloquent, beautiful, like Condemnation, Get Right With Me, Mercy in You, Judas, Rush, and others are just masterpieces, like In Your Room. That one is genius, epic. It awed me the first time I heard it, and I'm still in awe each time I hear it unfold as it gives me chills still, more than a decade later. There is so much going on in the music on this album: Dave Gahan's emotional, slightly rough yet powerful vocals, the spiritually infused tracks. I'm not a religious person but this album is a spiritual experience for me. It's thoughtful, bold, profound, poetic, silent, explosive. After all these years, I love it still. <br />
B000000OSE|5.0|Well I've been a Guns N Roses fan for a long time and I know all of their songs, when this first came out on Tape (some of you may not know what that is) I had it back then, so of course I had to get the CD.  This is one of their best.
B0009UC7H0|1.0|I am a fairly big fan of Clive Cussler, the author of Sahara, and have really enjoyed his novels.  Sahara was one of my favorites, so I eagerly anticipated this movie.  Within the first 15 minutes, I had to turn the movie off.  It's absolute trash.  The characters (Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, and Admiral Sandecker) are EXTREMELY poorly cast, which is my primary gripe.  The casting is so poor as to be the equivalent of casting David Spade as Rocky, or the Rock as Michael Corleone in the Godfather.  Nothing against the actors themselves, but they simply do not fit the roles.  It's as if the director never read the book, and had only heard the plot through word of mouth.  I beg you to read the novel, which is more of an adventure than this movie could ever dream of being.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|I can't see any fan of the band being the slightest bit disappointed with the show here. It is clearly a special performance and the tracklisting is hard to fault. <br /> <br />Overall the sound is clear and powerful - Geddy Lee's bass-lines are solid and driving, Neil Peart's drums lack a certain depth but are crystal clear and sharp and Alex Lifeson's guitar sounds come strongly through the range of effects pedals he uses.  <br /> <br />This is an outstanding performance, by the way... A LIVE performance... HELLO! for those ones who complain about sound quality... have you ever attended to a live gig? I don't think so, if you believe that \\"Live\\" DVD's with fantastic DTS sound, Dolby Surround, 2.0 and 5.1, etc, etc... I bet you that's at least 50% studio tricks, overdubs, and doctored performances. <br /> <br />This is how exactly how to sound a LIVE performance, with audience sing along and jumping all the concert, with the ACTUAL sound of the band performing in front of you. <br /> <br />So stop complaining about sound quality, because Rush In Rio is the only one TRULY LIVE DVD EXPERIENCE I've ever had the pleasure to watch and listen to. <br /> <br />Thank you very much, Rush
B0000019PA|5.0|This album is just a dream, a lucid relization that took the form of a pop record. The third song which is the title track is good enough to justify buying the entire album. If you've never heard this band and you wanna get creative artistic records and expand your musical palette, buy this record.
B0000025D0|5.0|DATEOT has a good reputation among Springsteen fans, and I was curious about it, so I picked up a used copy. Yeah, it's that good.<br /><br />Badlands: 10/10. My choice for best song on the album. Bruce uses contrast amazingly (with a great backup singer), and I love the solos.<br /><br />Adam Raised a Cain: 10/10. A slow, intense rocker, and another strong track.<br /><br />Something in the Night: 10/10. Softer as the first two, but just as good.<br /><br />Candy's Room: 4/10. I don't really like it.<br /><br />Racing in the Streets: 10/10. A song about escaping. Not what I thought it would be, but I love it just the same.<br /><br />The Promised Land: 9.5/10. A rewrite of Badlands to some extend, but with a different perspective and a catchy melody.<br /><br />Factory: 6/10. Not much good here but the last verse.<br /><br />Streets of Fire: 9/10. Bruce tries to sing like James Brown and it turns out poorly, but the song's good other than that.<br /><br />Prove It All Night: 7/10. Could've been better, but has a nice sax solo.<br /><br />Darkness At the Edge of Town: 10/10. A classic and great pick for closer. I love the verse/chorus contrast. It starts off soft, then explodes.<br /><br />Though Born to Run is better, I definetly reccomend Darkness.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|Crown of love is a wonderful track, the whole album is a nice place to go sonically if you have 45 minutes, It's a bit 80's for me but  I think this album still kills
630218021X|3.0|One could argue that this is Ken Russell's most understated film. That said, it's still a struggle to get through at times though Richard Chamberlain gives one of his finest performances. One senses that Chamberlain, decades away from revealing his own sexuality, felt a certain kinship to the Tchaikovsky presented in this film.    Beautiful music and scenery aren't enough to carry \\"The Music Lovers\\" and it falls a bit short as it drags on to it's inevitable conclusion. Still, Russell does a much better job by Tchaikovsky than he would by poor Franz Liszt several years later in \\"Lisztomania\\", one of the worst of films of 1975.
B00079FUI6|5.0|When I purchased this dvd i thought it would take a while But it didnt..I was shocked the dvd came fast..That makes me happy and want to purchase other things from seller <br />
B00004SW9R|5.0|Haven't heard this for years, but for some reason Gris Gris sprang to mind recently like some kind of beneficial voodoo for New Orleans.  Far as I can figure, no one has fixed this album from it's original analog recording.  It's glorious, dreamy, strange, hallucinatory and quite unmatched in originality.  The voicings are really arresting.  The lyrics and cadence are perfect.  It's music played by real musicians.  Playful and complete.  No collection should be without this.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I love this album, sure it ain't \\"Tool\\" but it's still amazing and the songs are just haunting and brilliant.  I love Maynards vocals and the rest of the guys are just awesome.  The best songs on this album is \\"The Package\\" \\"Noose\\" \\"Pet\\" \\"Vanish\\" \\"Outsider\\" such a great album but I must say I hated track 9 or what ever is the nurse song was just....plain bad...but the rest truly make up for what is an instant classic <br /> <br />4.8/5

B00005JNTX|1.0|This movie has style. Tons of it. <br /> <br />It also got some great actors and some well written dialogue. <br /> <br />But I did not like it at all. <br /> <br />This is a summary of the plot (WARNING: spoilers ahead): In Sin City ugly villains torture young and scantily clad women in very sadistic and degrading ways. And then old and ugly heroes save or avenge these women in very sadistic and degrading ways. <br /> <br />In the end I could not bear to see another ugly old man sacrifice himself for another young and \\"helpless\\" woman. Boring, stupid and sexist!!! <br /> <br />If you like stylish visuals, extreme violence, good dialogue and acting - buy Kill Bill. It's much more fun, somewhat less sexist and got a mean Darryl Hannah with an eyepatch!
B0006OBPTA|5.0|All four of the Karate Kid movies contain great wisdom from Mr. Miyagi!  Definitely worth watching and owning.  Other than a little bad language, they are safe for the whole family.  We find ourselves quoting Mr. Miyagi frequently after watching these!
B00005JKG9|5.0|Famous cinematographic adaptation around the tragic drama of some submitted commercials for tyrannical pressures for the top rank of the Management to get sales, based in a cruel competence. In this state of things all is permitted. Once more Pacino shone with own light, deserving another nomination.<br /><br />A recent classic, without restrictions.
B000002L9O|4.0|As has already been said before, this album cannot live up to the likes of Rocket to Russia or The self titled debut but then again not much can. But while it doesn't do this, it certainly does stand it's own as a pretty nice album. Being the cynic that I am I'm gonna start off with my main complaint, the producution. It sounds for lack of a better word... wobbly and unpolished but in a bad way. It feels like it was going for a nice produced sound but the producer got lazy if you know what I mean also some of the songs have a bit of cheese factor like She Belongs to Me but oh well every band has some cheese. Among this album's highlights though are four Ramones greats such as Bonzo Goes to Bitburg, Animal Boy, Love Kills, and Somebody put something in my drink. The other songs while they are at the very least decent, are not quite as good as those classics. While I wish Rhino would hurry up and get the Re-issue out this will suffice. Had the production been stronger a few of the songs like something to believe in would have been much better but alas it is not which leads me to give an album I find to be very enjoyable a 4 out of 5, get to work on the remastering Rhino, that oughta make this a five star album! Highlights: Somebody Put Something in my Drink, Animal Boy, Love Kills, Hair of the Dog, and Bonzo Goes to Bitburg.

IT STILL SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE AFRICA WITHOUT THE BIG LIFT UP OF THE CHORUS, IT SEEMS VERY SLOW,PLUSS JUST HAVING STEVES SLOW SONG BEFORE IT DRAGS SIDE ONE DOWN, BUT THE WORK THATS GONE INTO THIS SONG IS AMAZING. ONCE AGAIN I FIND THAT WITH MY CD I HAVE TO TURN THAT SONG UP IT'S AS IF THE VOCALS HAVE BEEN PUT  <br />RIGHT AT THE BACK OF THE MIX WITH THE KEYBOARDS AND THIS TIME <br />STEVE'S GUITAR,APART FROM HIS LEAD. <br /> 'STAY AWAY': LET ME JUST SAY STEVE LUKATHER, YOUR THE MAN! <br />THE GUITARS ON THIS SONG IS SO COOL,BUT FOR A STRANGE REASON THIS SONG JUST DOES'NT DO IT FOR ME, IT SORT OF PLODS ALONG LIKE <br />'LOVERS IN THE NIGHT' DID ON \\"IV\\". I THINK THIS SONG SHOWED THAT <br />EVEN THOUGH JOE IS A GOOD SINGER IN HIS OWN RIGHT, HE DOESNT HAVE THE ROCK VOICE THAT BOBBY KIMBALL HAS. I WILL SAY THIS, THE <br />GUITAR SOLO'S AT THE END WITH THE SLIDE, WOOOOWW!!!! <br /> 'STRAIGHT FOR THE HEART': NOW THIS IS BETTER,               JOE SOUNDS STRONGER VOCAL WISE, AND THE BEAT IS FASTER, ON CD IT <br />SORT OF SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE THE LAST SONG BUT FASTER,(that's why it sounded better on record because then your on side 2) <br />EVEN ON CD I GOTTA HAVE A SIDE 1 AND 2, MIKE IS GREAT ON BASS. <br /> 'ONLY THE CHILDREN': WHAT A CLASSIC!

0783229364|4.0|Fresh from his success in the first Back To The Future movie, Michael J Fox had a slot in film history starring in movies about yuppies.  It was a natural transition from his role as the stiff necked Alex Keaton on Family Ties that he would grow up and become a yuppie.  It was the roaring 80s, and New York had become a yuppie metropolis.   <br /> <br />Michael J Fox plays Brantley, a fresh faced Kansas farmboy who has come to the big city to seek his fortune.  Getting a tip from his parents that his uncle in a bigwig at a corporation in New York, he hopes to get a job there.  His uncle barely acknowledges him and gives him a job in the mailroom.  His dreams are squelched of having a suit, a fancy car, and a yuppie lifestyle.  While working in the mailroom, Brantley starts to fish through the company mail and reads their memos.  Deciding that he has something to say and can make a difference, he adopts a new persona of Carter, simply dresses like \\"A Suit\\", and gives himself a job there to change things.  Couple that with some smutty humor, trying to lead a double life without certain people finding out, and toppling corporate greeds and it was quite appealing. <br /> <br />His Aunt Vera's lust for him wasn't very hot.  She was more like a shark in how she pounced on him at every opportunity.  Helen Slater, post Supergirl, plays a stiff Suit who is also trying to claw her way to the top.  While she is fridged and formidable towards Brantley's advances, she is having an affair with the boss / Brantley's uncle.  It makes for a bunch of near misses and smutty humor. <br /> <br />This was probably the funniest yuppie movie I'd ever seen.  The main characters while trying to present a professional appearence and be good at their jobs, are actually sneaky, void of morals to be having affairs with other people's spouses, and ousting the capitalist pigs of the upper tiers of the company.  But they don't replace them with people who are more concerned about corporate ethics and doing good things for the people, they replace them with themselves.  They stop having their affairs, divorce their spouses and run off with the people they're having their affairs with.  When Brantley is found out he doesn't apologize for leading a double life, he only afirms how much smarter and more crafty he was than everyone else to have pulled this stunt.  He was a lovable yuppie scum.
B0000542D2|5.0|I'd just seen Paul McCartney in concert for the 1st time so decided to go back to the beginning.  This is a true classic which reminded me of the Beatles when they first hit the scene when I was 11 (Dad get me a guitar!).  The behind the scenes stuff is great too, I enjoyed it all.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|When I saw this movie as a kid in the theaters I asked my mom if I could take karate.  She said no because I think she wanted me to do something more feminine.  At age 22 I signed up myself after having watched this movie, and 8 years later I'm a second degree brown belt.   <br /> <br />While Ralph Macchio as Daniel took that New Jersey thing (\\"Hey howya doin?\\") a little too far, and was maybe trying a little too hard, this movie had heart.  It appeals to a certain something we all have: the insecure loner, being picked on by bullies, wanting that untouchable object of desire, etc.  But it's true, just as a martial arts principle is: When the student is ready, The Master will appear. <br /> <br />The Master appears as Mr. Miaghi, the super of Daniel's appartment building, who spends most of his time clipping bonsai trees and trying to capture flies with chopsticks.  Daniel dismisses him as odd and eccentric, then he is acosted by bullies for making the moves on one of their old girlfriends, he becomes their target.  Kicked around, bruised and bloodied, Daniel tries to pull through but the bullies are pretty sadistic and tormenting him turns into their favorite sport.  Mr. Miaghi rescues him, and afterwards takes Daniel as his student.   <br /> <br />I'm not trying to tell the world that this was the greatest movie ever made, far from as a matter of fact.  But as it was more geared towards the kid / teen set, it showed us what the martial way is all about.  It's about focus and balance, brings enlightenment, clarity and focus when there otherwise wasn't before.  It's not about fighting, it's about training and disciplining yourself so you don't have to fight.  While it's certainly violent, it's also peaceful.  While you're training yourself to fight, you're also training yourself so you don't have to fight.  It made enough of an impression on me that I carried the interest into my adult life, then picked it up and found the way.  Maybe it's not the best of the best,but it gave me enough of an inspiration to make me into a better person.
B000AM4PBS|1.0|this show is so lame.. this overpriced set will sell though because there will  always  be people that are willing to  buy  crap like this without question..  ! <br />  now  Seinfeld..thats a great show/also.. curb your enthuasim ! they should do  sets like this for those 2 shows.. this is my opinion and im entitled to it :)
0743454537|4.0|I picked up this book after hearing Jodi Picoult speak at a local library event.  If you think that her books are good, then go and hear her speak; she is fantastic.  This book is so moving.  What makes it especially poignant is that each of the characters has a chance to speak to the reader in the book and tell the story from his/her perspective.  This just adds to the books complexity; really making it multi-dimensional.  I would not hesitate to recommend this book to any reader or book club....just bring along the tissues.
B000BISBDY|5.0|This is an excellent mix of songs from throughout Johnny Cash's career.  The uncensored version of \\"A Boy Named Sue\\"  (which I had been searching for) was reason enough for me to buy this even though I have all the other songs on other CDs.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Trent Reznor's music has always painted an alien landscape of torture, angst, and at times- redemption. His latest album [With Teeth] is no exception. However, there are alot of people who seem dissapointed over this new NIN album. The album is simply alot more thoughtful, and more mature than previous albums. Fans of art and, emotion, and Trent's unique musical style will find this album a must. Fans of screaming, anti-everything mentalities who are hoping this album will make them look scarier will be disapointed, and will feel mislead by the albums title. Those who understand the slang for piano keys will be more in sync with the overall weight of the albums structure and lyrics.
0060934700|4.0|A collection of short stories culled during much of Gaiman's professional writing career (1984-2000), \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" is a testament to Gaiman's writing breadth. Sure, there's some fantasy here (the epitome being the sublime `Troll Bridge,' which we are told in the Introduction was nominated for a World Fantasy Award), but, really, there's so much more. Like the story about an alienated Santa Claus who hates his job, or the one about a world without animals, or that wonderful story about a self-sacrificing cat. Gaiman's great gift is that he takes the commonplace and re-invents them, adding a generous sheen of magic in the process. Never one constricted by the strictures of convention, Gaiman is quite comfortable creating his own worlds with their peculiar rules, and dropping the reader down the proverbial rabbit hole, challenging us to discard our metaphysical pre-conceptions. Like a modern day Rod Serling, Gaiman's has us confront the absurd in accentuating the tenuousness of our grasp on reality. The absurdity becomes all-the-more pronounced when his otherwise \\"normal\\" protagonists have no difficulty accepting the bizarreness of their situations i.e. an elderly widow who, with nothing more than quiet satisfaction, finds the Holy Grail in a second-hand shop.     <br /> <br />As he states in the Introduction, mirrors, when deliberately placed, distort and conceal while they simultaneously reflect reality. In this vein, \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" is Gaiman's (successful) attempt at telling us the truth about ourselves through the veneer of the incongruous.       <br />
0307276902|5.0|This is a compelling book.  Not only the central character, James but also the other patients become people you feel like you know.  He takes a brave step in suggesting that perhaps the Tweleve Steps isn't the only way to overcome addiction.  No crybaby stuff here...but rather taking responsibility for his own actions makes us root for James all the way.  A gritty, realistic portrait of addiction with no sugar coating!  One of my top ten for 2005 for sure!
0399143904|4.0|Before reading Rainbow Six, I had never read a Tom Clancy novel.       I had a trip planned to Fiji and wanted an action-packed, entertaining read for lazy days on the beach.  I had searced on the web for \\"best Clancy novels\\" and found that this was one of his most recommended books.   <br /> <br />That being said, I liked the book a lot.  It was very entertaining and most releveant--given the global struggle against terrorism.  I found that the last 150 pages of the book were a bit slow and repetitive, but all in all, highly recommended.
B00008977N|5.0|I was more than impressed when I first saw this on videotape , but the DVD adds sound options which really help to immerse yourself in the music . <br /> <br />The staging has been much talked about and it is certainly something to behold , yet it does not detract from the focus of the show . <br /> <br />I hesitate to call Peter an entertainer as this DVD shows him to be more than that - after all , his band match him in creating the moods for all the songs . <br />It is almost like a movie . <br /> <br />I look forward to showing this to people over the years so they can see the full potential of presenting music to an audience . <br />This DVD together with STOP MAKING SENSE would be a potent double bill . <br />See this and be enriched .
0786886811|5.0|I love this book. I really enjoy her style of writing as well. Its one of the books I turn to just to sit and read and relax, while I'm watching something cooking in the oven. I made the store cupboard chocoloate cake and it turned out really well. It really was as easy as she said it would be. The boxing day bacon and egg pie was another one I tried soon after Christmas last year. My husband really liked it. The brownies did not turn out so well, but I think that was partly my fault because I think left it in the oven too long so they became cake, but still was very edible with vanilla ice cream. This book has really given me a lot more confidence to tackle cakes and desserts.It truly makes me feel like a domestic goddess.. very nice
0783226063|4.0|This film is sci fi and is brought to you by a director who has taken film fans on a few strange trips .   DUNE is no exception , but I do recommend you read the book first . It will fill in the spaces in the film's plot .  The book has a glossary in the back , which will give you some idea of how many words are specific to the language and meanings .    The film doesn't always explain things , which can be effective , but maybe it leaves too much to the imagination - you get a feeling it has been shortened as you watch it , but the story largely makes sense .    For those who wish to go to another world , DUNE is the film to watch .
0099474425|5.0|You will be smiling right through the book. It is so funny and at the same time more than just a collection of witty dialogue. It is a touching love story. I am an avid collector and reader of Georgette Heyer Books. This is one of her best. Ths is one author I can read and re read over and over. Also recommended are Grand Sophy and My Lord John by the same author. Love her books!!
B000A1ENCU|5.0|Quo Vadis is the absolute best movie that never won an Academy Award. At the time of its release in 1951, it was the 2nd highest box office of any movie in history (Gone With the Wind was the highest). It was the first of the many historical epics of the 1950's and early 1960's. It is also the best. <br /> <br />Robert Taylor plays Roman general Marcus Vinicius, commander of the 14th Legion, and Deborah Kerr portrays a Christian lady, Lygia, that he falls in love with. Lygia is a hostage of Rome and Vinicius arranges with the mad Emperor Nero (Peter Ustinov) to have her reassigned to him. She runs away to the shelter provided by other Christians for fugitives from \\"Roman justice.\\" <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Nero wants to go down in history as being the greatest artist of all time. He is assisted in trying to come up with both ideas and proper wording by Petronius (Leo Genn). These scenes are great fun as Petronius does a wonderful job as the emperors' faithful counselor, and with his great wit manipulates the pompous and vicious Nero. By doing so, he helps protect the Roman populace from the evil emperor. <br /> <br />Also going on at this time is the growth of Christianity in Rome. Both Saint Paul (Abraham Sofaer) and Saint Peter (Finlay Currie) are present in Rome. The 2 saints hold services in the Roman catacombs. Christianity is a secretive religion since the adherents of Christ are under constant threat of persecution. <br /> <br />Eventually, Nero gets the idea that for him to create an artistic masterpiece, then suffering on a colossal scale must first take place. He orders his chief yes man, Tigellinus (Ralph Truman), the commander of the Praetorian Guard, to set fire to Rome and also to block the escape of the Roman population across the bridge to achieve maximum slaughter. Tigellinus carries out Nero's cruel decree and one of the greatest fires in history resulted. After Nero announces both his decision and also his plans to rebuild Rome under the name \\"Neropolis,\\" Vinicius bolts and goes to Rome in his chariot and succeeds in overcoming the Praetorians at the bridge to save multitudes from death. <br /> <br />The Roman people quickly figure out that Nero was the \\"incendiary\\" resposible for the burining of their beloved city. However, Nero decides with the help of his slutty Empress Poppaea (Patricia Laffan) that in order to deflect the blame from him, a victim needs to be scapegoated. From there, he decides that the Christians, who refuse to engage in worshiping the emperor as a god, make the best victims. Nero then decrees that it was the Christians who burned Rome and as such, they are to be all rounded up and fed to the lions in the colisseum as public entertainment. <br /> <br />Quo Vadis is a magnificent major motion picture. It has beautiful scenery, wonderful costumes and fantastic cinematography, and is as accurate a capture of ancient Rome as was possible with 1951 technology. The set designs are sheer artistry. Quo Vadis is a stunning spectacle with an excellent script, fine performances and holds up very well today. <br /> <br />The best part of this movie is Peter Ustinov's performance as the mad Emperor Nero. Ustinov is totally focused on the role so much so that he captures the screen in the scenes that he is in. Ustinov's performance is the absolute best portrayal of Nero yet given by an actor in a movie. Ustinov plays the role instead of converting the character into a reflection of himself. Ustinov should have won the Academy Award for his performance. He did, however, win the Golden Globe. <br /> <br />Thus far, Quo Vadis is the absolute best Roman epic ever made. The decor, costumes, and art direction certainly have not been matched by anything that followed, including Spartacus, Ben Hur and Gladiator. Quo Vadis is an excellent movie that is certainly well worth your time.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I was blown away, I thought this dvd was great. I expected the same old Clapton. Boy was I wrong. He said he had to get ready because he knew it was just him, no backup guitar or organ/piano. The Fender did sound alittle weak at first, but once you got use to it, it was fine. Bruce said they tried the Marshalls and all that old stuff but it just didn't work. They are older and not as fluid but once they started playing, it had that old Cream sound. Great dvd, so glad I bought it. All these \\"in\\" bands of today, who are making just horrible music should listen to what these 3 old guys can still do.......
0140187650|5.0|People reviewing this book keep saying that it doesn't contain the phrase 'banality of evil'...  it does right before the epilogue page 252.  Do people ever really read the books they review?  Anyway, this seems like dry mayerial but isn't.  Eichmann seems like joe any guy who goes from mildly stupid underachiver and useless to a mass murderer who never fires a shot.  How is this possible?  Well, it seems that human nature and a group dynamic contribute to the banality of evil that killed so many.  There is a wealth of information about not only the successes of the Reich but what stopped them dead in their tracks.  FYI it wasn't that hard.  I'll never see human nature the same way again..
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|When I first saw the Hell Freezes Over concert on public television in 1994, I was blown away. Here were rock's premier band members including the reunion with Joe Walsh. \\"Get Over It\\" became an anthem for me as I played it in the car whilst driving from Connecticut to California. But that's another story.  <br />Sadness erupts when I realize the great guitar master, Don Felder, is no longer with the band after a senseless squabble over royalties. In this concert, Felder shows off virtuosity on his old Gibson Les Paul with his riffs in \\"Get Over It.\\" Joe Walsh showed off his slide guitar skills on the same song but, it was Don Felder who punctuated the scales with his screaming, delicious notes as he finished the song with such precision and energy while looking so relaxed. Don Felder has been missed as a vital member of the Eagles. While the new Hotel California DVD is great, without Felder, it is missing something. Sorry Don Henley and Glenn Frye: you shouldn't have let Felder go.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Don't be scared away by what the critics say about this album and the one star reviews. American Life is a great album with beautiful love songs on it and some fast songs too, a nice blend. It is also the most personal in M' career. Some songs talk about what she wanted in life when she was younger and how she wants different things now that she has a beautiful family. She also sings about her love for her husband Guy Ritchie, how the loss of her mother effected her,  her relationship to Jesus Christ and about her son Rocco in Intervantion. Die Another Day is added in bonus from recent the James Bond movie and its just so great and my favorite fast song. It is not anti-american at all. There are no lyrics that talk about America. <br /> <br />American Life is a great song and the beginning has guitars on it and then at the end she does the rap about everything she has and then asks the question \\" do you think I'm satisfied\\" and we are led to believe she does not. She then mentions how she tried to stay ahead and on top and be the best and says \\"f*** it\\". She is not satsified with having everything or being the best anymore through everything she has learned in her showbusiness life. She has her family now and thats more important to her. Too bad the music stations did not play this great song because they thought it was anti-american and it is not There are no lyrics in this songs that make it Anti- American. <br /> <br />Hollywood starts out with beautiful birds chirping and then the quitar playing and talks about how everyone wants to come here to make it and how \\" music stations always plays the same song\\" which is so true!!! Her voice changes at the end where she says \\"push the button, don't push the button\\" \\"trip the station\\" \\" change the channel\\" . This is said 4 times and each time her voice gets deeper and changes. This song implies that Hollywood isn't that grand once you get in and make it and it really not what you bargained for assuming all the stress and how fake people are. <br /> <br />I'm So Stupid is about how stupid she was because she wanted to be like all the pretty people, good message bad song skip it.  <br />Love Profusion is another slow song and you hear Mirwais in the background vocals singing Love Profusion. The songs talks about \\"too many questions but not one solution\\" and how \\"there is so much destruction and all I want is a celebration\\" . Implies what is going on in the world today I assume. I love Nobody Knows Me its my favorite fast track next to Die Another Day. It starts off with computer beeping. Madonna sings about how know one really knows her and they only know her star image. She also say \\"Its so hard to find someone to admire\\". Great inspirational words. <br /> <br />Nothing Fails is a very emotional moving slow song that beginngs with the guitar playing with the London Gospel Choir singing in the back towards the end and ending with the guitar. She talks about her love for Guy Ritchie and how she has climbed the \\"tree of life\\" and \\"I no longer care if I fall\\" She has because of everything she has learned from life and and if she does fall it wont effect her that much anymore. Intervention: Is a good song too. It starts off slow and gets faster. It has a little acoustic sound mixed in it.  She sings \\"I know that love will keep us together\\" Talking about her son Rocco . <br /> <br />X-Static Process is another slow ballad played by the acoustic guitar. I dont like the song and the music very much and I usually skip it.Mother and Father: I love this song and it also starts out with computer beeps. Madonna starts singing in somewhat of a childlike voice. I really like it. It is also a fast song with a little rap towards the end. This songs seems very personal to Madonna and sings about her loss of her mother and how it effected her. She also sings about her Father and how she did not like him because she wasn't getting any attention from him.Die Another Day: Is just a great song from the James Bond movie. It actually my favorite on the whole CD. Its the full version and not the radio edit. I like this one better more cools sounds and it's like 45 seconds longer!! Easy Ride is a beautiful ballad that says she wants to work hard and doesn't want to sit back and not do anything. Easy ride has a little opera in it and the music and sounds is absolutely stunning. I have never heard such an amazing song like this. <br /> <br />This is a very good album. It talks about her life experieces and what she has learned from them. I would higly recommend this CD. Except for I'm So Stupid and X- Process I give it an A. I think many people can relate to this CD. It does have love songs on it and some good fast ones!!
0446577383|3.0|In typical Baldacci fashion the reader is swept onto a roller coaster of action, suspense and murderous intent with most sides; the Americans, Iraqis, North Koreans, Persians clearly intent on massive death and destruction. Then, Deus Ex Machina!  Baldacci does it again when he unfortunately uses the very same devices he used in an earlier book, also about the Secret Service, to carry the plot forward. After this disappointment, I found it hard to continue to the predictable end. Maybe, David should get to know another Service Branch of our government for fresh story and or plot ideas.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I've read so many bad reviews of this album, and I just don't understand why. It's a great follow-up to the slightly better \\"Is This It?\\". Really, there's not a bad song on here. I hope The Strokes get better treatment from the corporate suits on their third release, which should be awesome it it follows suit of their first two. <br />
B00005JNTX|3.0|You have to give Robert Rodriguez credit for remaining faithful to Frank Miller's vision, but the graphic novels do not translate very well to the screen.  It reminded me alot of Richard Romanus' Heavy Metal, as Rodriguez tried to piece together several of Frank Miller's stories into one movie.  Still, I liked the look and feel of the movie, a deeply saturated black and white with spot colors.  It was interesting to see such actors as Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood transformed beyond all recognition.  Clive Owen proved to be an inspired choice as Dwight, making a good contrast to Benecio del Toro's talking head.  But, in the end, this movie simply didn't add up.  It was more like a promotion for Frank Miller's serial graphic novels, which he continues to put out having gone beyond comic heros such as Batman and the Daredevil.  This isn't kids' stuff, but a series drenched in lurid sex and violence, which seems to be the staple of pulp fiction these days.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|This album hits every genre of music. It is truly Ryan Adam's best album. You can tell that he is still true to his country roots, yet with strong overtones of Blues and pure Rock n' Roll. Unlike any other of his albums, this is a must have if you like all varieties of music. <br /> <br />Check out the popular single \\"New York, New York\\" with other sleeper hits such as \\"La Cienga Just Smiled\\" and \\"Answering Bell\\".
B000002BHE|5.0|I guess this album is one of the best albums ever released by a female vocalist (well, it may not be so if you are not a pop fan, its alright!) <br /> <br />Personally, I love the song 'Because You Loved Me'. I am so embarassed to say that I get to know Celine Dion through this song but not her previous hits like The Power Of Love or Beauty And The Beast. When I first this song, I was so in love with the song, lyrics, the voice and the rythmn. From then on, I started to like Celine's songs. No doubt this song/album deserved recognition from all the major award presentation. <br /> <br />Another song which I love is All By Myself, a true song to challenge a singer's voice and ability. Celine managed to handle the song so well that I was amazed by her powerful voice as well as the way she presented the song. <br /> <br />Personally, I give 5 stars to this album, I guess none of my CD collections in my cupboard can out beat this album because too many great songs in the album, namely 'Because You Loved Me', 'It's All Coming Back To Me Now', 'Dreamin's Of You', 'Call The Man', 'I Love You', 'You Make Me Feel Like (A Natural Woman)', 'All By MySelf'.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|The Who was the greatest rock band to storm the world. Great lyrics, great melodies, great musicianship (Entwistle is/was the greatest bassist ever!). <br />To the reviewer below who quotes Kurt Cobain slandering The Who back in the 1990s: Who gives a rip what Cobain said about The Who? Nirvanna is the most overrated band in rock history, and didn't achieve what The Who did. Cobain was just filled with jealousy and envy that The Who are usually considered by society as being in the top 3 or 4 bands of all time. All Nirvanna did was be the first Seattle grunge band to have a hit single on MTV. So Cobain helped kill hair metal, big deal. That doesn't make them worthy to stand alongside The Who, no matter what the (young) big media says today. Say all you want about the post-Moon Who, but the band in 2000, still with Entwistle, was incredible! Nirvanna is just crappy music, crappy guitar solos, crappy singing. Boring. And their name wasn't even original. There was a signed band called Nirvanna in the 1960s. Keep your Cobain and Green Day. Those two haven't done anything new under the sun, although society claims differently now. Give me The Who anyway, anyhow, anywhere. Like The Beatles, Cream, The Stones, Queen, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, The Who really were innovators. <br />peace
B000063DIH|4.0|When I received this cd a little while back, I'll admit I was a bit nervous. Of course, I already had Powerslave, # of the Beast, Peice of Mind, and NPFTD (which were all terrifc Maiden cd's in my opinion) and I didnt think that this cd would come close to matching the four I already had. I popped the cd in and had me a listen. Here's what I heard:<br /><br />Be Quick or Be Dead: This song is very cool and a greatest hit on Essentials. It's fast, heavy, and the vocals and guitar work are sensational! The solo is great and its just an awesome maiden song all around. For this cd, not maiden songs altogether of cource, I give it a 9.5/10. p.s. all my ratings on the songs will be related to just this cd.<br /><br />From Here to Eternity: I didnt like it very much when I first listened to it, but after a while it kind of stuck with me. The opening guitar is very catchy and the vocals are really different from what Bruce usually sounds like. The solo from Dave is blistering and one of the best on the album. The chorus is definetly catchy and easy to sing to also! It's a very good, solid song overall and deserves a 8.5-9/10.<br /><br />Afraid to Shoot Strangers: I was a fool, naked in the rain so to speak, but now I see my ways! Yes, the lines above are my header and also borrowed from Ronnie James Dio, but they are very true. When I first got this album, I listened to ATSS and shunned it, saying things about it that aren't true. Now that I've had the album for a long time, and have listened to this gem often, I can't get it outta my head. Afraid to Shoot Strangers starts off slow, and while that is why I made fun of it before, I now love it to pieces. It's a great ballad of sorts and has really meaningful vocals from Bruce and great guitar during the intro. After a while, it gets really fast with blistering solos and fast drums! This song is a perfect example of how not to judge a song on only two listens and to just let it stand on it;sown two feet! Easily a 9/10!<br /><br />Fear is the Key: Everybody on this review board said that this song wasnt iron maiden, and while it's a weak song and one of my least favorites by maiden of all time, it definetly sounds like Maiden. It got a pretty decent intro and of course good solos, but other than that it's pretty damn weak for Maiden and is lacking many things. I can truthfully give it no less that a 6/10.<br /><br />Childhood's End: A very strong song in my opinion, with a great intro and outstanding drums and guitar during the chorus. Awesome, meaningful verses and the lyrics in the chorus are sad, but very powerful. I loved this song the moment I heard it, and it's still one of my tops on th album. It's not slow, but it's not lightning fast either. A very enjoyable song that gets a 9/10.<br /><br />Wasting Love: Also a ballad like ATSS, but it's a little heavier. I used to think this song was \\"ehh,\\" but now I really enjoy it. Good, strumming guitar during the verses that gets heavier when the meaningful chorus comes in. Before the awesome solo, the guitar kind of has a \\"creeping\\" feel to it that sounds sweet. 8.5-9/10<br /><br />Fugitive: A very outstanding song that reminds me alot like \\"Fallen Angel\\" off of Brave New World. Heavy guitar and pounding drums start this song off and then everything gets softer and after it gets heavy again, the verses come in and what you got is a work of art. The chorus is also one of the best on the album and as well, so this song has no true faults. The solo is also incredible. 9.5/10<br /><br />Chains of Misery: This song is pretty damn sweet! The guitar during the verses is heavy and good, but what's awesome about this sng is the phenomenol, creeping guitar at the chorus, or the little part right before the chorus if you look at it that way! All in all, a strong Maiden song that has a great chorus with what sounds like the whole gang singing \\"Chains of Misery!\\" 8.5/10<br /><br />Apparation: The worst off the album and probably my least favorite by Maiden. A very weak song altogether that doesn't really have any good qualities to speak of. 5/10<br /><br />Judas Be My Guide: I absolutely love this song and I'll guarantee you will too. This ode to Judas Priest (in my opinion) is strong and very meaningful. The intro is new and creative and the chorus is to die for. 9.5/10<br /><br />Weekend Warrior: A great rocker and metal song! The guitars are pretty easy (easy to play that is) but sound good nonetheless. I liked it and its a good, solid maiden song! 8/10<br /><br />Fear of the DArk: IT WILL BE ONE OF YOUR TOP THREE MAIDEN SONGS BAR NONE! PERIOD! 10/10<br /><br />>My first review really was not well thought out nor accurate and I apologize for that! I didn't listen to the album as long as I should have and I \\"jumped the gun\\" on way to many songs. While \\"Fear of the Dark\\" is in my top five least favorite albums by Maiden (Maiden doesn't have a single bad album in my book), it's still a solid, and creative piece of work by the Metal Masters. I would just like to close by saying that there are 3 points in which this album is good even if you don't like the songs: 1. This may seem a little juevenile, but who can argue that the album cover flat out kicks @ss! It is one of my favorites cover arts in all of Maiden's collections. 2: The production is very well done, much better than it's predessor an it's successor. Every instrument distriputed perfectly and they all sound awesome. The drums are some of best in all of Nicko's career, and the solos sound amazing. 3: This album was made by Maiden, Iron Maiden and therefore it is not a sloppy, thrown together pile of poop, it is a MASTERPIECE!lities to speak of. 5/10    Judas Be My Guide: I absolutely love this song and I'll guarantee you will too.

B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Music is a form of expression, when that expression is successfully articulated the message and the emotion it invokes is replicated in the listener. <br /> <br />Robert Plant in my opinion has always been true to musical expression rather than pleasing a bubble gum chewing demographic to make a profit off of record sales. This was also true of Led Zeppelin which was an extraordinary collection of musical virtuosos. <br /> <br />This album is a return to the kind of musical sophistication that made Led Zeppelin one of the greatest rock ( rooted in blues ) band right up there with Pink Floyd (a band that was 30 years ahead of their time). <br /> <br />If you still have a chance to catch the Robert Plant and Strange Sensation Mighty Rearranger tour - do it. This was the best rock concert I've ever attended - but then to be fair, I'm a \\"died in the wool\\" Led Zeppelin fan and they did quite a few Zep songs that night (which was the 25 year anniversary of John Bonham's death). <br /> <br />
0064407667|5.0|When I first saw these books in the library, I thought they looked dumb, and I said to myself I would never read them. Then for my birthday I got a gift certificate to Barnes & Noble and decided to buy the first two (don't ask why, because that's still a mystery to me), and boy am I glad that I did.  <br />   I absolutely love these books. I have read all of them, including the newest one, The Penultimate Peril. These books get better and better as they go along, as well as bigger. I enjoyed the last one more than the others, but not by a lot. I was rather disappointed when I heard there is only one more. <br />   One thing I have to say: I hate how these book websites say most of these books are for kids 9-12, or grades 5-6. I think books that are labeled '9-12' are better than most young adult books. I'm fifteen, and I enjoy these books. I enjoy most every book I read that is supposedly recommmended for kids 9-12. I find it very discouraging, and often I find myself not reading a book just because it says ages 9-12. I wish they'd not put an age recommendation on books. Someone said they feel the same way, so they never read books labeled that. Please, GET RID of the age recommendations.  <br /> <br />   But anyway, I totally recommend this book, and the rest of the series. <br />
B00005V1WO|4.0|On a dark and stormy night, in a remote, but lavish country estate, in an equally distant Victorian mansion there resides the charismatic, but often eccentric, Englishman, Lord Byron. Staged for an exercise in humanistic logic, scientific philosophy and creative writing, he gathers an odd assembly of thrill seeking Bohemian characters. Among the notables, are poet Percy Shelly, his author wife Mary, his personal physician, and of course their host, Lord Byron. Beginning with a blasphemous premise that they are imbued with the power to create life itself, Byron suggests they abandon their earthly inhibitions of morality and civil conviction and drink a concentrated draft of Laudium laced wine. The terrifying after effects manifest themselves in the literal passages later found in the poetic works of Percy Shelley or his wife's most famous novel Frankenstine. With a storm raging high above them, the group evokes sacred beliefs, sacrilegious rites and amoral concepts which create a frightening spectral atmosphere that nearly consumes them. Anyone seeking the foundation of the most popular Gothic monster ever created, should view this film. ****
B000002N2Z|5.0|Even though the Deftones debuted in 1995--a year after Korn--and their debut has drawn some criticism as being a Korn rip off (because it does sometimes sound like them), it is every bit as important as any other C.D. for creating nu-metal. Bands like Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit (two bands which sound nothing like Deftones) have expressed their love for this band. \\"Adrenaline,\\" which was called alternative or \\"sneaker metal\\" at the time, is definitely the Deftones at their roughest, rawest, angriest, meanest, and most aggressive. Its large, meaty riffs, pissed off raps, primal yells, and all-around energy make this album sound nothing like their later discs. Grinding, rusty-sounding riffs begin track one, \\"Bored,\\" which is arguably the best song on this record. But my personal favorite is \\"7 Words,\\" a mosh-ready anthem against police corruption and racism, with a big, heartfelt, furious shout-along chant of \\"Suck, suck, suck!\\" for a chorus. \\"Engine No. 9\\" is another favorite of mine (it has catchy, fast, riffs and angry rapping) and is probably the heaviest song on here (as well as one of the heaviest Deftones songs ever written). \\"Minus Blindfold\\" has bludgeoning, churning riffs and lung-stretching yells; frontman Chino Moreno shows off his singing skills on \\"One Weak\\"; track four, \\"Nosebleed,\\" is another kick to the head, featuring more stutter-step rapping over a fast, driving rhythm/riff; and, finally, \\"Root\\" is probably the best example of (guitarist) Stef's chunky riffs. \\"Fist\\" is the only song on here that falls flat, but every other (preceding) track more than makes up for it. So, as you can see, \\"Adrenaline\\" is definitely an appropriate name for this album. It should get as much recognition as \\"Korn,\\" and it is a great album to listen to when in a bad mood, if you're interested in the early days/founding fathers of nu-metal, or if you just want something to rock out to. And if you think you know the Deftones (or you dislike their later albums), but you haven't heard this C.D., you haven't heard anything, yet!n't heard this C.D., you haven't heard anything, yet!
B0000074GK|5.0|I bought this album quite awhile ago.(17 yrs. I think.) The cover was different than this cd cover.That's why I bought it. I never heard of these guys before and I only saw it on cassette tape. i STILL HAVE IT.And I still listen to it.Check out \\"Until my dying day\\" LOUD.This guy has a voice in the range of Ronnie Dio but a little nastier.I'm going to buy more from these guys now that I know they were not \\"one album wonders\\" Buy this,it's KILLER
0553275976|5.0|For me, at the beginning there was an intrest in how all of these people related together. What could a Bronx defense attorney have to do with this guy that makes a ton of money on Wall Street?  <br /> <br />Sherman McCoy had a demanding presence throughout the book. He is the elusive millionare that everyone wants to be. He seems to have everything...what could possibly go wrong? <br /> <br />Then there is his mistress. She is cheating on her husband, but seems otherwise harmless. It turns out she just may be the sneakiest of all. <br /> <br />I cannot believe how the justice system was run in this book. What Kramer did was crazy. I felt it really gave me an inside look at what really happens and how people try to win over their consituants. Poor Sherman just got lost in the shuffle. A great read!
B000B2YQX4|3.0|We all had high expectations for this album.  Let's be realistic, Depeche Mode has an amazing body of work to live up to. 'Playing the Angel', to me, compares a lot to 'Pornagraphy' by the Cure.  They are dark albums with cool sounds, and deep lyrics and vocals.  The Cure and Depeche Mode, alike, have created many fantastic, dark, somber, deep songs- songs that take you away to an absorbing, pensive, thoughtful place.  But 'Playing the Angel' is a more flat, somewhat boring, unoriginal entry into this genre.. as was 'Pornagraphy' by the Cure (granted, 'Pornagraphy' was a more revolutionary effort at the time).  I really like \\"Precious\\", but I'm not really a big fan of any of the other songs on this record..  There are no alluring hooks, nothing bold or daring.  It's a safe, relatively dark, pleasant album.. Nothing obnoxious, but nothing that will alter the face the genre.  Many would think I'm crazy for saying this, but 'Exciter' (2001) is a different, yet alltogether, much better album than 'Playing the Angel' (see my 'Exciter' review).  One positive thing I will say is that David Gahan sounds really good on this record and in it's limited use, the synthesizing of his voice is pleasantly subtle and well-placed.
0786852550|5.0|With so much watered down fantasy out there and all the Potter wanna be's Stroud delivers this magical world in a somewhat different perspective.  With new fantasy creatures and and a page turning plot, with some very unique characters this book will surely keep you interested.  The first few chapters are a little tough to get through, but the rest of the book is a real page turner.
B00000637V|5.0|This is a very optimistic cd. Really. The music sometimes sounds arch after all these years, but the disengaged nature of the voice, as though sung on valium, carries the beat of genuine poetry. In particular, both the music and the lyrics at the very end seem incredibly optimistic to me..it has the hope and strength of someone who has survived something very terrifying. Not for depressives, though; or anyone going through an emotional crisis; or anyone who feels they are living it. Keep it and play it when you've got through it.
B000000OQF|5.0|\\"Apetite\\" is the greatest hard rock album of an era...from start to finish...both musically and lyrically brilliant...its too bad that this group could not stay together...newcomers, both young and old will relish in its brilliance...
B0000062S0|4.0|The first thing you notice about the record is the way it has been recorded. It is certainly not a slick, polished, radio-friendly production, and in a sense is perhaps an audiophile's nightmare. Frequencies sometimes sound indistinct, and many of the vocal takes are recorded very dry, whilst the instrumentation is enhanced by merely room ambience, rather than excessive use of plug-ins, digital reverbs, compressors, EQs and the like. In reality though, it is this dynamic and organic approach to cutting tracks that the record benefits from. Frequently the band swing from passages so quiet and gentle you fancy you can almost hear Plant breathing into his mic, to powerfully loose sections in which Page is often inspired to produce fretwork that is magnificently understated, beautifully executed and very moving. The rhythm section combine to subtly underpin the melodic passages and drive the harder sections with a dynamic aggression; they've never sounded better, and Page and Plant have never been more ably supported. Throughout the recording Page makes subtle use of effects to enhance his guitar playing - a touch of tremolo here, a dash of tape echo there - and it sounds as though most his overdrive comes from careful use of his guitar's volume control rather than pedals or rack effects; once again it's this natural approach to playing that makes it rank amongst his best on record. <br /> <br />The songs themselves are amongst the finest that Page and Plant have written together. Plant's lyrics are straightforward and resonate with an honesty that is refreshing and rewarding to listen to time and again. His more poetic side is beautifully balanced, for the most part not drifting into pastiche. The melodies are interesting, and often a song will traverse several moods with musical twists and turns along the way, never becoming formulaic. What they do require is time and effort - time to actually sit, listen and enjoy. There are one or two exceptions - Burning Up, Houseof Love and Sons of Freedom sound to me as though a few riff driven rockers were urgently needed and had they been consigned to the b-sides collection, I wouldn't be complaining.  <br /> <br />A reviewer below questions Albini's involvement and suggests his presence is hardly felt. In so saying, he has completely missed the point of Steve Albini and good producers in general. Albini was not brought to the sessions to make Page and Plant sound like Nirvana, (for which we are all no doubt, very thankful), but what he has done is what every good producer strives to do - get the best out of the band and onto tape. If a record sounds like a producer has left their muddy footprints all over it, then it becomes the producer's record, not the band's. This is the sound of a band playing together in a room, and Albini has captured it well. <br /> <br />I understand why some people haven't taken to it. It doesn't have the immediacy of some of their earlier recorded output, nor the weight and urgency. It is understated and reflective, and that's exactly what I love about it, and what many, it seems, hate about it. Well, that's OK, I guess, each to their own! But, overall, in my opinion, this is an excellent record, expertly performed, beautifully recorded and well worth the money.
6305971099|2.0|This is the 4th sequel to ''Halloween'' and judging from the looks of this movie, The series is beginning to die down. Michael Myers continues his killing spree as well as his mission to murder his neice, Jamie [Danielle Harris, Returning from the last film]. Dr. Loomis also continues his efforts to stop Michael Myers from killing. Well, I don't have many good things to say about this movie. This movie gets quite boring at times and the stuff just seems like it's over-familiar by now. But, As many sequels go, It's just another attempt to cash in on the original film's success. The plot is very weak, The acting is bad, And the movie is just boring at times. However, There is 1 [Barely] memorable scene in this movie: Near the end, Michael Myers unmasks [But unfortunately, It's quite dark in the place that he unmasks, Meaning you won't get that good of a look at his face]. Other than that, This is just a forgettable sequel. Hope my review helped. Be Blessed, Have a nice day.
0060974176|5.0|For those of you long in the tooth you may recall John Cameron Swayze's love-in with Timex watches where in a 60 second commercial he would submit the watch to behemoth like torture, rodeo riding, outboard motors, and then hold the watch up and say, 'it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.'<br /><br />So the Toyota Production System (TPS) makes their now famous pilgrimage to the US Auto workers and are soundly - rejected.<br /><br />The important part of this is not so much that we refused to accept their business points and authorities but raher that they did it so well, and went back to doing it so well.<br /><br />The TPS includes paying by seniority, not position, no American type manager, group consultation sessions of representative workers to make important decisions, performance maintenance, 1/3rd the production defects and you could go on.<br /><br />We won't adapt that style of business because of the polarizartion of labor and management and a host of other reasons. However, it's a good lesson to read in other businesses where leaders may consider adopting some of the more successful portions of TPS. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
6305291446|3.0|20 Years after the events depicted in the first 2 movies, Michael Myers returns to once again try to murder his sister, Laurie [Jamie Lee Curtis, Doing what was her first halloween movie in 17 years] who is now a private school teacher and a mother [Josh Hartnett plays her son] that now lives in southern california. It isn't as good as it could've been, But it's definitely worth watching. The acting is pretty good and the ending is memorable and the story to this film was actually the most interesting idea anyone had for this series in years. Even though there are a bit too many false alarms and not enough moments of true horror, This film is, For the most part, Worth looking at. Even though i think they should've let Michael Myers die years ago, I accept this movie for what it is. And that is, a fairly entertaining sequel. And keep in mind, This movie ignores everything that happened in halloween 4-6. You won't be informed of anything that happened in the 3 films before it if you've never seen any of them. But, Definitely, If you're a horror fan, Try to rent this movie sometime. Hope my review helped. Be blessed, Have a nice day.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|After looking at the latest BILLBOARD top 40 list and seeing that I do not like any of the artists, I have to say I'm simply glad to have a new album from DM.  Thanks guys!!  I may have had my expectations too high for this one, because I just can't get into it.  All the pre-release reviews I read said it was pure DM, but I don't think this sounds like anything they've released before, sans the track DEAD OF NIGHT on EXCITER. <br /> <br />Tracks I listen to:  SINNER IN ME, PRECIOUS, I WANT IT ALL, LILLIAN, and DARKEST STAR <br /> <br />These tracks are good, but I feel that all of them have so much more potential.  The remaining seven tracks?  Too much production on them (beeps, chirps, etc...).  This record sounds like someone took a blender and poured in MODE, MASSIVE ATTACK, and NIN, but left that blender on WAY TOO LONG! <br /> <br />Again, I'm very happy to get a new DM album.  Unfortunately I'm already looking forward to the next one. <br /> <br />KB
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is so incredible. I first heard about it after seeing the movie based on the show (Serenity), then I bought the DVD set on faith alone, and sure enough...Firefly is a sci-fi masterpiece!!! It's a shame that it was canceled only after airing 11 episodes, which by the way was no fault of the show itself bacause FOX execs decided to air episodes out of chronilogical order. Anyway, this show it fantanstic. It's very funny, all characters are extremely interesting, and each episode is like an mini sci-fi epic movie. Don't take my word for it...see to beleive.

0684830485|5.0|\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is a perfect example of what makes Ernest Hemmingway one of, if not the, preeminent writers of the first half of the 20th Century.    Although his machismo style does not appeal to everyone, (especially the feminists who find his portrayals of women to be degrading and unrealistic) this is a perfect example of his style and of the cruel realities of the world of his time.    Hemingway's signature terse writing style lends itself perfectly to the telling of the story of the loyalist guerillas during the Spanish Civil War.  His writing style perfectly captures the way of thinking one would have while in such a situation.    Although undoubtedly the love story between Robert Jordan and Maria is weak, yet it doesn't detract from the overall beauty and poignancy of the story, for first and foremost this is a war story.    Hemingway does what he does best in \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", which is to capture a slice of life from a bygone era.  Although set 70 years ago, Hemingway's story has as much meaning in a modern setting as they did when they were written.  It is a true classic in every sense of the word.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|The Funhouse Album.  Can it get much better than this?  Apparently it can.  I'm not one to buy reissues, remasters, and such.  I have found that sometimes a remaster can be worse than the original!  This is one remaster you're going to want to get, though.<br /><br />The opening track of the Stooges' Funhouse album is \\"Down on the Street\\".  Henry Rollins once described the driving rhythm that begins this album as a sound that makes a person want to either f[...] or fight, but you know something's going to happen.  This album scares people.  It is violent.  It is sexy.  It is everything that makes rock and roll worth listening to.  An incredible mix of rock, protopunk, and even some free jazz to top it off.<br /><br />So, why get the remaster?  Honestly, my ears are not in tune enough to be able to tell a difference between this version of the album, and my old beat-up version.  That being said, you need to buy this album for the incredible Second CD that it comes with.  This album was recorded over several days in Los Angeles.  Each day the band would focus on recording one new song live in the studio (something that was not very common then, with emerging advances in studio technology).  Every song had several takes and many different versions throughout the day it was recorded.<br /><br />The second disc consists of several of the alternate takes of the songs on the Funhouse album, and they are incredible.  The new and unique interpretations of some of these songs are something any Stooges fan will want to hear.  You might even end up liking the alternate versions more than the ones you are familiar with!<br /><br />On top of the alternate takes, there are two new tracks, \\"Lost In The Future\\" and \\"Slide (Slidin' The Blues)\\".  These are both great songs recorded in the same session, and they come out sounding incredibly clear (most stooges collectors know, tracks like that are hard to come by).  If you are a long time Stooges fan, you need to pick up the remaster.  If you don't own any version of this recording, what are you waiting for?this recording, what are you waiting for?
B000B5IPLK|4.0|I actually bought the CD/DVD version.  I was a little disappointed with the dvd in that it didn't give enough \\"behind the scenes\\" conversations with Alicia, the back-up singers or the band.  I really enjoy dvd's and shows like BET's 'How I'm Living' where artists, musicians, actors & atheletes let us, viewers truly behind the scenes of thier real lives and this dvd just left me wanting more.<br /><br />Overall, I think this was an excellent purchase since I've never seen her perform in concert and the moments on the dvd when she speaks to the crowd are engaging.  I also think it's important to note that on some songs she was hoarse due to having to re-record 4 songs after a problem with MTV's recording machinery so to those commenting on how bad she sounds on some songs, that's why.<br /><br />The best thing about \\"unplugged\\" albums is that we, the listeners get to hear a performer in a new light (best past albums in this genre to me were: Nirvana, Maxwell & Mariah Carey. Who can forget the stunning brilliance of Maxwell's \\"This Woman's Work\\"????).  Anyway I didn't buy this disc expecting perfection, just another set of music to add to my Alicia collection.  I'm not a musician so I can't comment on her piano playing skills like so many others have done on most reviews I've read of her music on Amazon BUT I can comment on the fact that her music makes me FEEL something which is why I'm a fan.<br /><br />Of the new music she introduced, I love Alicia's Prayer, Unbreakable - it's infectious and I love the sentiment behind the words; Stolen Moments is truly georgeous - she sounds great, the back-up singers and band are also amazing; Every Little Bit Hurts - good cover; Wild Horses - competent duet.<br /><br />The old songs that I really enjoyed hearing again were: Karma, Heartburn, Butterflyz, Goodbye, How Come You Don't Call Me, If I Was Your Woman & Diary.<br /><br />Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase and definitely recommend it to her fans and although I was disappointed with the contents of the dvd, I'd still purchase it again since I did not tape or record the MTV showing and I truly enjoyed watching Alicia & co perform.
B000002UY5|5.0|This album is truly amazing. Every song on it features a great melody and awesome guitar work and Shannon Hoon's voice is one of a kind. Its one of the sad stories in rock that Hoon died. Blind Melon would have been huge for a long time. <br /> <br />To those who give this album a negative review: You obviously have absolutely no taste in music, you obviously dont play any instruments, and therefore you opinion doesnt count.
B000641ZA4|5.0|I am extremely happy with seller.    Great service, fast, and promised as delivered.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|Havingly recently seen Christopher Nolan's spectacular \\"Batman Begins\\", I thought it was time to go back and re-visit Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\".<br /><br />Tim Burton has long been one of my very favorite directors.  With his taste for dark, humorous, wacky and often weird films, he was the perfect choice to direct \\"Batman\\".<br /><br />Michael Keaton plays Bruce Wayne, who - shhh - is actually Batman.  Keaton was an interesting choice for Wayne/Batman, and he gives a great performance.  Jack Nicholson is absolutely wonderful as The Joker - a perfect casting decision.  He also delivers the now-classic line, \\"You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?\\"  Kim Basinger is Vicki Vale, the lovely journalist whom both Bruce and The Joker fall in love with.<br /><br />The score is definitely one of the film's highlights.  It's by Burton favorite Danny Elfman, and was one of his earliest scores.  It truly is fantastic - \\"The Batman Theme\\" is everything it should be and more.  Elfman's music is flawless.<br /><br />Another terrific aspect of the film is the set design.  The film's sets are magnificent.  They perfectly capture the dark, Gothic city that is Gotham.<br /><br />All the aspects I've mentioned above work along with fine photography and a good script (by Sam Hamm) to make a really great movie.  One of the film's few flaws - though I think it's kind of neat - is the music by Prince.  Prince contributed numerous songs to the soundtrack, and it's the one thing which dates the movie.  I'd highly recommend this movie; die-hard Batman fans may not agree with the slight twisting of the Batman legend, but they should appreciate Tim Burton's interpretation of the tale.
B0002I831S|3.0|When I got aeound to picking up Star Trek the original serries vol.1 I had a bit of sticker shock. Amazon was by far the best price for a new copy, but even then for the material it is a bit pricey. Nice looking video quality and a fancy storage box aside, I will have to think hard about spending any more money for the rest. I guess the question to ask yourself is \\"How much do I love Star Trek vs the cost?\\" 3 not 4 stars because of price.
0446677450|5.0|Kiyosaki is not much of a writer (even though this book is actually written by a friend of his using Kiyosaki's content), but he is a very good communicator. <br /> <br />Some readers have whined that he is pandering to the money hungry out there....Folks, I got news for all of you...I'm in the IT industry and we're losing jobs to overseas by the thousands each month (and some times each week). Kiyosaki's book tells you how you need to adjust your thinking from that of a person who expects his success to be delivered to him via trickle down from his salaried job. <br /> <br />U.S. companies are outsourcing jobs overseas and are hiring contract workers right and left. Why? Because they don't have to pay benefits and it's just plain cheaper! I don't like either, but that's what's happening. <br /> <br />This book will teach you to start thinking differently and activate a different mindset so that you can become self sufficient - no necessarily a millionaire - but no longer dependent on a corporation for your welfare and retirement. <br /> <br />Wake up folks! This isn't the evil idle rich taking from you. This is a wake up call to keep yourself from becoming one of those sitting in the unemployment office. <br /> <br />Buy this book!
B000002G87|4.0|My first experience with this album was with the remastered version, which sounds a bit different from the orginal mix.  Thus I suffer a bit from having to not only judge the songs as they stand on the album, but against the anniversary remix as well.<br /><br />That being said, this really is an exceptional album that somehow improves in the CD era.  Clapton's inspiration --his unrequited passion for Patty Boyd and the ensuing turn of events-- can be seen throughout the album, if not exactly on every song.<br /><br />The album has sadly been ignored for the most part, despite its brilliance.  Beyond the sublime and impassioned \\"Layla\\" few people are familiar with the songs on this album.  A turn on Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\" is emotional in a way the original never was.  \\"It's Too Late\\" has an extremly catchy melody and words to match.  \\"Keep On Growing,\\" recently covered (poorly, in my opinion) by Sheryl Crow, is energetic, and \\"Key to the Highway\\" is quite powerful.  The other songs are excellent as well, except for \\"Thorn Tree in the Garden,\\" the only song that will make you thankful for CDs.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|This Edition is the highly demanded 2-disc DVD of Batman Begins.  The only difference it that this one does not include the comic book.  So if you couldn't pick up the 2-disc edition here's your second chance to get it, but miss out on the comic book.  This is the best Batman movie since Batman Returns I can not wait for the sequel for this movie is going to be great.  I suggest this purchase very higly eventhought you don't get the comic book.

THe man who said Hanz Zimmer isnt a composer, is retarted! Im sorry for being honest! I personally saw Mr. Zimmer and Mr.Howard make this production and i believe they did a good job! Liked the movie, liked the soundtrack, but could have been a little better to become 5 stars. Best soundtrack of all times i believe is \\"GLADITOR\\"
0679422714|1.0|As a Chinese reader, I feel sorry for those Western readers who are interested in China are misled by Jung Chang's Mao: The Unknown Story. This book is completely distortion of Chinese history. <br /> <br />When I heard that the authors spent ten years researching and writing this book, I thought that there must be something new which the Chinese don't know about, because there have been so many books about Mao in both Chinese and English. After reading it, I was appalled at how they shamelessly distorted the history. <br /> <br />In order to prove how well this book is searched and how true their story is, the authors have cleverly included pages of bibliography, notes and index and long lists of people, especially well-known personalities in the world whom they interviewed. In fact, they are not honest at all. They took facts and information out of context from others' books, twisted the meaning of contents and used them in their book. They boasted that they even interviewed Mao's inner circle. Jung Chang wrote vividly that Mao fancied his English language teacher Zhang Hanzhi, the wife of former Chinese foreign minister Qiao Guanhua. Nicholas D Kristof, columnist of the New York Times is a friend of Zhang Hanzhi. He asked her about it. She told him that she informally met Jung Chang a couple of times and was not interviewed. She said nothing substantial to Jung Chang. When I went back to Beijing recently, I heard that Mao's inner circle felt shocked and cheated when they heard that Jung Chang wrote such a book of distortion. Jung Chang approached them, saying that the book `Private Life of Mao' written by Dr Li Zhishui is so damaging to Mao's legacy and she wanted to write a book to defend Mao. She also promised the staff in Mao's inner circle that she would speak for them, because all the staff disapprove what Dr Li wrote in the book. Now, they are so angry and protest against this book. Many other interviewees also felt shocked and cheated. I doubt if Jung Chang dares to face these people when she goes back to China. <br /> <br />Please read the following reviews and critics about this book written by some well-know academic professors and Sinologists.  <br /> <br /> <br />A swan's little book of ire <br />Date: October 8 2005 <br /> <br /> <br />Jung Chang has created a great story in her latest book, say the critics. But now there's a brawl over the facts. Hamish McDonald reports.  <br /> <br />A tiny widow aged 85 living in two rooms, an electric rice-cooker her only modern appliance, may be a crucial witness to a dispute involving Jung Chang, the wealthy Chinese author of the worldwide bestseller Wild Swans. <br /> <br />The dispute is one of many being picked up by some of the world's most eminent scholars of modern Chinese history, who say Chang's latest blockbuster, Mao: The Unknown Story, is a gross distortion of the records. <br /> <br />Few are disputing that the subject, the late Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong, was a monster as a human being and a leader who put his country through hell. Or that the book, written by Chang and her British historian husband, Jon Halliday, who live in great comfort in London's plush Notting Hill on the proceeds of Wild Swans, is powerful and destined to be highly influential. <br /> <br />But many people agree with Thomas Bernstein, of Columbia University in New York, that \\"the book is a major disaster for the contemporary China field\\". <br /> <br />\\"Because of its stupendous research apparatus, its claims will be accepted widely,\\" he said this week. \\"Yet their scholarship is put at the service of thoroughly destroying Mao's reputation. The result is an equally stupendous number of quotations out of context, distortion of facts and omission of much of what makes Mao a complex, contradictory, and multi-sided leader.\\" <br /> <br />As well as factual errors and dubious use of sources - which even favourable reviewers such as Princeton's Perry Link (an editor of The Tiananmen Papers) have felt compelled to criticise, many scholars point out that much of what Chang and Halliday present as a previously \\"unknown story\\" had in fact been exposed long ago. But no credit is given to earlier writers. <br /> <br />These disclosures include Mao's endless supply of young female bed partners, his appalling personal hygiene, callousness towards wives and children, the vital support of Stalin, his party's trade in opium, its shirking of the war against the Japanese, and Mao's ruthless diversion of resources to building the atom bomb. <br /> <br />\\"I've looked through the book's treatment of the 1920s and there is nothing there that wasn't known,\\" said the Australian National Universtiy's John Fitzgerald. <br /> <br />\\"A lot of stuff in their great untold story is pretty well known,\\" agreed Sydney University's Fred Teiwes, who wrote a decade ago that support from Moscow had been critical in Mao's rise as party chief. <br /> <br />Li Guixiu was a 15-year-old girl when an event that may have been pivotal in the modern history of China and the wider world - and which is also pivotal in Chang and Halliday's demolition of Mao - took place on the ancient chain suspension bridge overlooked by the back window of her home then and now. <br /> <br />On the morning of May 29, 1935, the vanguard of Mao's Red Army arrived at this bridge across the raging Dadu River during its famous 6000-kilometre Long March. <br /> <br />According to the Chinese Communist Party, a Red Army squad of 22 soldiers stormed the Luding Bridge later that day in the face of withering gunfire, across timbers that had been set afire and then along bare chains where the Nationalist forces on the opposing riverbank had removed planks. <br /> <br />Had the crossing failed, the Red Army would have been cut off in a narrow valley high in the mountains of Sichuan. A pursuing army sent by Kuomintang (the Chinese Nationalist Party) leader Chiang Kai-shek would have wiped them out, maybe eliminating the chance of China going communist, as it did in 1949. <br /> <br />\\"Complete invention,\\" said Chang and Halliday in their book, which has stayed for weeks on top of bestseller lists in Britain and Australia, and looks set to do so in the US, where it will be released this month. <br /> <br />The bridge was not defended at all by the KMT side, they say. \\"Chiang had left the passage open for the Reds,\\" the authors state, in one of the most astonishing assertions of their book. Far from trying to intercept the Red Army, Chiang was shepherding it to its destination, even leaving a truck filled with maps and food in its path at one point. The reason: Chiang was desperate for the return of his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, kept a virtual hostage in Moscow since 1925 by Mao's main backer, Stalin. <br /> <br />The authors claim this is supported by archived Kuomintang cables. And they claim to have met a local woman - \\"a sprightly 93-year-old\\" in 1997, running a bean curd shop near the Luding Bridge - who remembered the Reds firing a few sporadic shots across the river but no gunfire coming back, and who said that very little of the planking had been removed. <br /> <br />This week in Luding the Herald could not find the authors' unnamed local source, or anyone who remembered someone of her description. But it did find Li, whom other locals said was the last surviving witness they knew of in Luding. <br /> <br />Li says there was indeed a battle. \\"The KMT warned us that the Reds would eat the young people and bury the old,\\" she said. \\"Many fled up the mountainside. But when we saw them, they told us not to be afraid, they only opposed bad people. I remember they were wearing straw shoes, with cloth wound around their shins. <br /> <br />\\"The fighting started in the evening. There were many killed on the Red Army side. The KMT set fire to the bridge-house on the other side, to try to melt the chains, and one of the chains was cut. After it was taken, the Red Army took sevendays and seven nights to cross. Later, I was told that someone we had seen was Mao Zedong.\\" <br /> <br />Oxford University's Steve Tsang says the Chiang Kai-shek archives show the KMT chief did in fact order the senior warlord in the area to hold the crossing on pain of court martial. <br /> <br />Chiang Kai-shek did not on this occasion or, as far as his papers reveal, on any other occasion, let the Red Army escape during the Long March, Tsang said. <br /> <br />In this case, as generally in the book, the authors had been \\"appallingly dishonest\\" in the use of sources they claimed to have accessed. <br /> <br />\\"Mao was a monster,\\" Tsang said. \\"[But] their distortion of history to make their case will in the end make it more difficult to reveal how horrible Mao and the Chinese Communist Party system were, and how much damage they really did to the Chinese people.\\" <br /> <br />The list of historical errors and far-fetched theories builds up. Leeds University Emeritus Professor Delia Davin, writing in The Times Literary Supplement, said Chiang Kai-shek's son had gone to Moscow in 1925, with his father's permission, to study rather than being virtually kidnapped there as Chang and Halliday imply. <br /> <br />The execution of Wang Shiwei, which the authors say was used to terrify young intellectuals in the \\"rectification\\" campaign of 1942, did not actually take place until 1947. <br /> <br />While Mao was no ideal husband or father, Davin said, the authors must have noted the account of the Chinese commander in the Korean War, General Peng Dehuai, when he told Mao his son, Mao Anying, had been killed by a US bomb: Mao trembled so violently he couldn't light his cigarette and was silent for several minutes. Chang and Halliday quote Mao's secretary as saying Mao had not \\"shown any great pain\\". <br /> <br />While no one is minimising the cost of Mao's follies - notably the 30 million dead from famine caused by the Great Leap Forward - scholars point out that in the saneinterludes between these campaigns China showed remarkable economic growth and dramatically improved indices of social welfare, with life expectancy doubling in the 1950s. <br /> <br />None of this gets a mention in Mao: The Unknown Story. Nor is the drive for the atom bomb so surprising in light of China's century of humiliation by foreign powers up until 1945, and the subsequent hostility shown to the new communist state by the US. <br /> <br />Driving the book is an unrelenting hatred of Mao, and a determination to pile up evidence to blacken him as totally selfish and sadistic. <br /> <br />Francesco Sisci, veteran China reporter with Italy's La Stampa newspaper, said: \\"You don't feel cold analysis in the book, you feel hatred, which helps to make it a wonderful read. But history should not work this way.\\" <br /> <br />Sydney University's Teiwes recalled meeting Chang and Halliday in Sydney during their research. <br /> <br />\\"She just had her views so set, and was unwilling to entertain other opinions or inconvenient evidence,\\" he said. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the least likely among the Chinese to welcome the book's historical revision are the people along the route of the Long March, now starting to enjoy a business boom from a \\"Red Tourism\\" drive promoted by communist leaders. <br /> <br />At Luding, builders are finishing a huge new museum that includes a mural of Red Army troops grappling their way across the bridge, amid gunfire and flames. <br /> <br />The bridge itself is much as it would have looked in 1935. Swaying in the middle of the crossing, Chinese-American tourist Shu Zhou posed for photographs in Red Army tunic and cap with a fake rifle. \\"I rented all this for five yuan,\\" he said. <br /> <br />While the critical battle over the Chang-Halliday book is only setting in, at least one incident was being played out in a way Marx predicted: history repeating itself as farce. <br />
B00008BRB5|5.0|I believe it was in 1980 that I heard about the band called 'The Police'. Intrigued by their unusual name, I decided to give them a try and bought their album \\"Ghost in the machine\\". Not knowing what to expect, I ended up liking that album a lot and over time it grew on me, until finally it became one of my most favorite albums. There were songs which had haunting melodies like \\"Invisible sun\\" and songs with high energy merry-making melodies as in 'Every little thing she does is magic.' The album was unique and totally original - however, even at that age I felt that the band was just slightly rough around the edges.    I was eagerly anticipating their new album with a very strange name called \\"Synchronicity\\" and when it finally arrived I rushed out to get it. I pressed the play button on my walkman and started listening.     Instantly it became clear that the production quality was massively superior than GITM's. It also became clear that the Police had become extremely polished and sophisticated at songwriting. They had shed their old skin and a whole new band had emerged complete with a clutch of hit songs which to this day get extensive airplay. There were utterly no signs whatsoever of the roughness around the edges previously spotted on their earlier work.    Songs like \\"King of Pain\\" and \\"Wrapped around your finger\\" transported me to another place, from which I did not want to return. So I kept going back to that place again and again.    The song \\"Mother\\", one of the few on the album not penned by the maestro Sting, made me laugh with its funny lyrics - 'Every girl I go out with, becomes my mother in the end'.     \\"Tea in the Sahara\\" almost made me cry. \\"Miss Gradenko\\" made me think.    But when I heard the first microsecond of the electronically processed sound of the snare that opens the song \\"Every breath you take\\", I got a 100,000 volt jolt of electricity and my walkman almost burnt down to the ground, since I was holding it in my right hand.    To makea long story short, \\"Every breadth you take\\" was and still is and will always be, one of my most favorite songs of ALL time. Believe me when I say, that I actually remember the first time I ever heard it on my walkman - and this was over 20 years ago. So you can imagine what kind of an impact the song had on me.    Those people who think that EBYT is about a stalker, need to understand the passion and the pain behind this song. The lyrics are not meant to be taken literally. For example, in the song \\"Yellow\\" by Coldplay, when the singer says \\"Look how the stars shine for you\\", he obviously does not mean that literally but is merely expressing his love for someone he loves. He can't be insane enough to really believe that trillions of stars are shining for his loved one. Same thing with EBYT - Sting isn't literally saying that he's gonna turn into a homicidal maniac or a blood thirsty stalker - he is simply expressing the anguish of losing someone he dearly loved.    The album kept me wrapped around it for at least six months and I'm still undergoing the after effects of having bought it and listened to it.    Some time later, a German uncle of mine sent me the CD for this album and that was my first CD ever! I did not even have a CD player back then, but I had the Police's Synchronicity on CD!    If you have ever enjoyed a single song by the Police or by Sting, and you don't buy this album, in my opinion you'll be doing yourself a great disservice. You'll be missing out big time.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Song for song this may be their best album yet! I can't stop listening to it, although it can make you a bit depressed. But then again, that's what makes Depeche Mode so special! The music is great and Dave's vocals are just incredible! I highly recommend this album.
B0002O0CM0|5.0|I was totally impressed by the quality of The Doors in these two albums. They seem to have gotten more jazzy and artsy than ever. After hearing American Prayer I'm pretty sure we can all agree that they should have kept playing after Jim died, if only instrumental or soundtrack music. The singing of Ray and Rob are average, the songs are short, fresh and sweet, and the musicianship of the Doors as well as the guests is simply stunning. While I think Jim was the voice of the Doors, these guys are the music of the Doors and they simply live up to that glorious expectation. Ray and Rob's solos are great without being forced or pretentious, and John shines through with his minimalist and jazz approach to the drums. <br />There is no question as to whether fans of the Doors should be getting this.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Wow, with DangerMouse on board, who would've known that Damon Albarn's and Jamie Hewlett's creations would've amped up their sound and vibes and came out with a sophomore album that is ACTUALLY GOOD! I kid you not. The songs are all much better than their debut. They've come a long way in the 4 years spanning their first disc.  <br /> <br />The best songs, in my opinion, are \\"D.A.R.E.\\", \\"Kids With Guns\\", \\"Dirty Harry\\" and of course their first single \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" Honorable mention goes to \\"White Light\\". The rest of the album is good,too. A must listen for sure!
B000B2YQX4|2.0|Ihave been waiting for a new DM production. When I heard Precious, I think it was a return to paths a la Violator, but is most a mix from Song of Faith and Devotion with no guitars and a minimalistic approach without and objetive.  The disc is indeed the darkest production, but not the better  You have to listen the songs many times before you start to like them.  The disc is incomplete and the production is full of mediocrity, I concur with the ones that miss Alan Wilder. <br /> <br />Definitely DM should do it better if they want to stay fresh, actually they are not what they used to, and I doubt they would be again what they were in Music for the Masses, or Violator (the best albums).  Playing the Angel lacks of the power of those productions both in the production and in tempo.  DM missed the chance to recover their site as an influential and innovative band they once were.  <br />
0393324818|4.0|At its core, Moneyball tries to answer one big question:  How in the world did the Oakland A's win 103 games in 2002, with one of the smallest payrolls in baseball?   <br /> <br />The book answers this question by going deep into the management philosophy of Billy Beane - GM of the Oakland Athletics, and considered by many to be the best businessman in baseball.   <br /> <br />Beane knows something that other teams don't - that you don't have to have a huge payroll to be competitive in baseball.  He knows the most important stats to look at when juding offensive talent (and no, it's not batting average, hits, or home runs) and he knows how to get what he wants from other teams - so much so that other teams are often reluctant to deal with him. <br /> <br />High-payroll teams like the Yankees have recently come under criticism for having huge payrolls and buying out the biggest and most expensive free agents.  So why aren't they winning more championships?  This book explains the myth surrounding talent, as well as some general misconceptions about how best to play a baseball game.   <br /> <br />The book also introduces the wonderful story of Bill James - a writer and baseball theorist (yes, there are such things) who went from working in a pork and beans factory to becoming one of the game's most respected analysts.  His story is not only surprising, but flat-out inspirational.   <br /> <br />James's statistical analysis has been one of the biggest influences on the A's management philosophy, and has led to a lot of unexpected success.   <br /> <br />Michael Lewis has a solid, easy-to-read style, and the subject matter draws you in and keeps you turning the pages.   <br /> <br />This is a great book for any fan of baseball, and anyone who is interested in baseball management, and the business of baseball.
B0000025ZF|5.0|Sometimes a piece of work is so esoteric and eccentric that it defies categorization and comprehension. When Pros was first released in 1984, reviewers and listeners who like their rock music straight balked at having to deal with an album that was nothing like they had ever heard before. Well, almost never heard before. A year before Pros was released, Roger Waters, then still the primary force behind Pink Floyd, had created The Final Cut. <br /> <br />Together both albums occupy a singular place in music, and represent a totally new kind of approach to rock - one that struggled against the linear limitations of the form and strove to express a range and complexity of ideas and emotions within the confines of a 40 minute LP. <br /> <br />The Final Cut, essentially a lament to continuing war 50 years after the end of WWII, remains the more accessible of the two. Pros is far more personal, a seemingly disparate and unsettling journey into the depths of human consciousness and sub-consciousness. The album follows a sequence of dreams and nightmares a man, clearly Roger Waters himself, has in the course of one night. In a deft touch that helps make this point, every song has a time prefix to show the time the man has the dream. <br /> <br />This concept serves as an excellent vehicle for Waters to create what he himself has said is his only album about only sex. But it is sex in its deepest and fullest sense, and Pros explores the fears, fantasies, and challenges of middle age: from dreaming about seducing bright-eyed young hitchhikers, to divorce, loneliness, depression and, somewhat strangely for Waters, the redeeming power of love. <br /> <br />Apparently Waters wrote this album about the same time as The Wall and presented both ideas to the rest of Pink Floyd. That the band chose The Wall is easy to understand, for, as band members later confessed, they felt awkward about working with material that was so intimate. Waters was going through a hard time between 1977,when Animals was released, and 1984, when he broke with the band. In-between, he also got divorced and struggled with some personal issues that he still has not spoken about publicly. But the clich that pain produces passion is true, and this period was amongst the most creative of Waters' career. <br /> <br />If Waters was exorcising his personal demons through his music, then Pros is where a lot of them collected. The album begins with a guitar lurch that has to be among the most dramatic openings of any rock record. As the song-cycle progresses erratically, shuttling between vitriolic screams, nervous brooding and placid passages that show a gentle side of Waters that remained obscured on earlier albums, they create a nervous tension and sense of foreboding that invade the entire album. <br /> <br />In many ways this is vintage Waters: dark, intense, and evocative. But the one difference is that unlike earlier Waters albums that dealt with broad issues, this time the lyrics are precise, blunt. They don't rhyme as the did on Dark Side of the Moon, and comparing Pros to this 1972 classic is like comparing a Dali dreamscape to a Manet landscape. Waters' verses in Pros are sharp, asymmetrical and at first it seems as if the wordsmith in him didn't quite do the job. But as one settles into the album, especially after a number of listens, one appreciates the dark edgy lines, the ingenious symbolism and the powerful imagery it creates. <br /> <br />Given the album's fixation on sex there's plenty of deep breathing, moaning and grunting. But beyond that there is a sense of urgency and sensuality to the music lurking just beneath its somewhat perplexing exterior. <br /> <br />Waters voice also sounds different from the way it did on previous Pink Floyd albums, and here it has a drier, more somber quality. Waters half-speaks, half-recites his lyrics rather than sings them, and in keeping with the albums startling shifts in dynamics, there are also sections in which he does some of his best singing. <br /> <br />Musically, the roots of Pros are pure blues. But, like Wish You Were Here that is also rooted in a slow blues rhythm, the blues blood in this album sometimes becomes unrecognizable because of the variations Waters takes it through. <br /> <br />The sound on many songs is sparse, much like The Final Cut, and at first listen a lot of the material sounds like just filler. But Waters makes the best of the few notes and harmonies that frame many of the songs with his traditional attention to musical detail. The timing on the album is excellent, and the arrangements, sound effects and instrumentation Waters uses combine to give all the songs poignancy and weight. The 3 or so more traditionally structured songs on the album, such as Sexual Revolution and the title song, simply explode through your speakers. These tracks are the closest Pros gets to previous Floydian albums, excepting The Final Cut, though here the sound is tighter and less atmospheric, so space rockers will be disappointed. <br /> <br />That Waters used his hunting mate Eric Clapton to replace David Gilmour as guitarist on this album is now part of rock lore. Clapton's guitar work is masterful, and whether whispering or exploding into incendiary blues riffs, Clapton's guitar follows Waters erratic and innovative musical ideas effortlessly, giving perfect voice and tone to the range of moods the album demands. True, Gilmour's mournful, moving sound would have been more suited to the album, but Clapton's precise and fluid playing is a pleasure. People who attended the Pros concert tour said the music was even better live, though it was rumored Clapton found Waters' demands for precision tiresome. Still, the two remain good friends. <br /> <br />To compensate for David Gilmour's absence in the vocals department Waters makes extensive use of background singers Doreen Chanteer, Katie Kissoon and Madeline Bell, who rise exceptionally well to the challenge. Interestingly,Waters also makes extensive of the saxophone, the first time he has done this since Dark Side of the Moon. David Sanborn is the man he chose on this album, and what a good choice it is. In fact, Clapton, Sanborn and Michael Kamen, who co-produced the album and played piano on it, got along so well that they worked together to create the soundtrack for the movie Lethal Weapon. <br /> <br />Ultimately, it is the story Waters is trying to tell in Pros, and the message he is attaching to it, that make this album an essential part of any serious music lovers collection. When a man tears his heart out and places it on vinyl, as say Leonard Cohen does, it is hard not to sit up and listen. Pros may try our patience at first, but once inside this incredible work, it is hard to leave it, or have it leave you.
0743487583|5.0|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a classic in the horror genre and to me it far outshines Broker's Dracula and his other novels which can sometimes appear like turn of the century pulp fiction horror. Shelley was a masterful writer who conveyed a powerful theme at the core of Frankenstein. It was the 19th century, the earlier half of the century. Shelley, the infamous poet Lord Byron and another writer were on vacation and living in a castle. They made up a bet. They were to write a work of horror and the writer whose book was the most frightening and intense and most successful was to receive honors by the group. Mary Shelley had a phantasmagorical nightmare which became the plot to Frankenstein. What a way to write a book. Since its publication, it has become an instant classic and attained popularity for years. Hollywood has made various movie versions. Kids still dress up as Frankie for Halloween. Mary Shelley wrote more than a horror piece that was meant to win a bet. Indeed it is intensely scary but its message is strong. In the 19th century it was a cautionary tale. Darwin's theory of evolution was out and man was accomodating themselves into a new, secular world full of inventions and scientific progress. Medicine became more advanced. Industry boomed with railroads, steamships, factories, and later in the 19th century- film, phonographs/record layers, telephones and electric lightbulbs. Shelley was urging people not to lose their faith in God as a creator and that to play God could spell disaster.<br /><br />Doctor Frankenstein represents the modern man, the atheist, the scientist, the new creator. It rings true today since we are so advanced in our science that we are able to produce new life both bacterial in form and human cloning. Dr. Frankenstein is a naive idealist. Initially, he believes that by creating this man from the cadavers of human beings, he will create the ideal man, free of evil and a figure of hope for mankind. Perhaps Dr. Frankenstein's mistake still applies to scientists today ? Will cloning humans turn out to be a huge disaster ? Will they be more monstrous than human. But it's interesting to note just how human the monster can be beneath his monstrous exterior. He feels human emotions like other people - love, hate, anger. This way, Shelley blurs the line between humanity and monstrosity. We are ourselves monsters because we continue to engage in war, build bigger weapons and believe we are indestructible in our technilogical progress to the extent we sometimes lose our soul. Frankenstein is just that a monster because essentially he is a human missing a soul. Each phrase, each description is poetic, vivid and powerful in is imagery and symbolism. This is the only true literary horror novel that one can make essays and master thesis on. No other work can do this. Perhaps only Anne Rice novels but for the most part, horror novels seem to lack the literary themes that this book contains. If you still haven't read it, and have seen the movies, don't expect it to be the same. This is on a class of its own. But most assuredly the book is better.mistake still applies to scientists today ? Will cloning humans turn out to be a huge disaster ? Will they be more monstrous than human.

B0007Y08QA|3.0|I am not writing this formal review (negatively) to take away from the performances and/or direction in this wonderful little film.  They are stellar in fact.  This movie is disturbingly fun.  Unfortunately, the content within is more disturbing to me because it is blatantly ripped off from other (smaller) pictures of it's kind.  Copyright laws really should be investigated here.  I am not here to point fingers though, so I will not name films.  But I am truly surprised that other genre fans did not start buzzing about these similarities upon The Machinist's theatrical release.  I wanted so much to like this film, but I am forced to look past this wonderful production on account of originality.  Am I alone?  <br /> <br />I am giving this film 3 stars because it was made so well.  It loses 2 for lack of originality.  The making of extras on the DVD are mostly interesting, but the filmmakers come off as petulant little boys that say things like \\"uh cool like ya know uh like\\" incessantly.  I really wonder how these people made such a great film.  They speak as if they are uneducated idiots.  Well, I do know where they got the idea, but I am not telling... <br /> <br />Has anybody seen...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There's action, interesting characters, and witty banter.  I believe that Firefly was the best television series Joss Whedon has created yet.  It really is too bad that the Networks gummed things up and cancelled it.
0316168815|4.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" was definitely something different to read, as it looks and the murder of a young girl and how she views the world after her death.  The young girl, Susie Salmon, continues to watch her family and friends (as well as her murderer)from Heaven, as we also get a view of what life after death is like.  This book had a very different concept, that I felt worked quite well, although seemed a bit strange at times.  It was easy to read, but difficult to put down, and it is recommended you read this book.
B0006A9IVQ|1.0|There is perhaps one good scene in this film--when a smiling and buxom Sophia Loren seems to be spanking someone naked, who turns out to be a window manikin in the window manikin factory where she works.  But don't expect the rest of the film to be this witty.  In fact, it's hard to understand how a great director like DeSica would consent to have his name attached to this piece of drivel.  The plot is melodramatic and predictable, the photography is kitschy, the acting (even Sophia's and Marcello's) mostly wooden--but then who could deliver such melodramatic dialog with any conviction?  In addition, the DVD quality is truly execrable. Avoid subjecting yourself to an hour and a half of tedium, and instead see \\"Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow\\" again . . .
B0007P3582|2.0|this cd wasn't that great, definitely wasn't a massacre, all tracks sound alike do to his flow, same thing over n over again, needs to think of sumden different, best song was 'i'm supposed to die tonight' em's n dre's production save this one, i did like most songs to an extent but some was just wack n most lyrics from em sucked but whateva he gon' do what he do n keep gettin rich so good luck to him, the get rich or die tryin' soundtrack is pretty nasty though, he stepped some of his game up on it but it's still the same flow, oh well cd's not bad, i wouldn't recommend it, get that new soundtrack instead
B000301YY8|5.0|\\"Back to Bedlam\\" is the best cd of 2005. Seriously. It begins with the best song on the cd \\"High\\" and ends with the hauntingly poignant song \\"No Bravery\\". Just when you think you've heard the best track on the cd, the next song comes on. I hope James Blunt has a very long career.

YES MY 40 YEAR OLD WHITE MOM! This Album is amazing, it is better than his greatest hit's, and that's saying something. I don't have this CD anymore, cause it got really scratched up about a year ago when our landlord gave us three day's to get out of our house. ( In haste of course ) both disc's got pretty messed up.<br /><br />Most other album's I would just download all the song's, but I feel it is a crime to download this, it is just so amazing, and it is the best CD I own. Better than Illmattic, Ready to Die, Cronic, Straight Outta Compton, AND EVEN AL GREEN'S GREATEST HIT'S.<br /><br />I still see this Album on store shelves, and it is cause it is awesome.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not a fan of Joss Whedon or television in general, but when Firefly aired I was glued to the TV for the first time in over 20 years. <br /> <br />The series and movie \\"Serenity\\" is some of the greatest works of sci-fi ever produced for film. The cast and crew chosen to put this awesome achievement together have put larger scale productions to shame. <br /> <br />The growing fan struggle to bring this series back to television is a testiment to it's greatness.  It's going to be a while before we see something of this quality again. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this set.  14 episodes of excitement, laughs and even a few tears.
B000002UWW|5.0|This album is a comilation of the most popular older Red Hot Chili Peppers songs, I must say I really enjoy old RHCP, new RHCP is great, no doubt, but old RHCP is a lot louder, more fun, more my style of music. Hillel Slovak rocks on guitar, it really is a shame he died before the band became a major sucess, and Flea is just slapping the crap out of his bass more so than on any new RHCP record, Anthony Kiedis really diverts his voice, he never sounds the same on one song, original drummer Jack Irons is admittedly no Chad Smith, but he's good enough. Best songs are \\"Fight Like A Brave\\", \\"Backwoods\\", \\"True Men Don't Kill Coyotes\\", \\"The Brothers Cup\\", and of course \\"Under The Bridge\\", warning to new RHCP fans, you will be shocked when you here this album, but you will love it, GET IT!
0451209338|3.0|This was an interesting and informative spy novel involving Israelis and Palestinians. Not a new topic. The main issue I have with this book is that even though entertaining it is predictable all the way thru. This creates an anticlimactic feeling when you are reading because you always know what is going to happen next.  <br /> <br />It does introduce Gabriel Allon, a very interesting character that comes back in many of Silva's other books. This is one reason why I will give Silva another try, the other reason is his fantastic debut novel \\"The Unlikely Spy\\", the talent is there, it just did not quite worked this time. <br />
B000AL730O|1.0|Paul is living through the daughnting anticipation of turning 64. The man is working his wits to out do his self prophecy made so elegantly simple in this song. He most certainly does not want to live his life through the legacy of this song. He is a man on a mission to prove that he is not the 64 year old man on a rocking chair patiently waiting for the  tea as  he watches his grandkids play.     Paul predictably chose his brand of music as the arena. Sadly, the painful truth is that his music nowadays is just good enough for a 5 second car tv commercial.     It's not a good sign when your the Most Famous Person Alive but your most recent offerings  are not even played in radio.     If not for the massive promotion and the world wide web, this album would have been easily forgotten  and ignored, a feat  that those who unwittingly bought his album are trying their best to do. It may not be easy though.    It boggles the mind and it's probably one of the greatest mysteries of the universe to find how the same man who gave us Hey Jude and Penny Lane can come up with such lame  music.     Just thinking about it is such a torture.    I'm still left with this nagging question which for all intent and purposes does not have any hope of a worth while answer.     The torment lingers.

B0009ZHJ7S|2.0|It took three seperate sittings for me to get through this movie - I really wanted to like it - seriously, there is only so far you can go with a fart joke before I have to leave the room.<br /><br />Doubtful I'll ever purposely watch it again.  This is another one of those poorly executed great ideas that you watch die onscreen....you've seen it before:  The poor but determined kid leaves the small town to make his dreams come true in the big city, only to find that the big city is not all that he thought it was.<br /><br />This would have been perfectly acceptable for a made for TV movie, but for the big screen I expect a little more.  The forced gags (the Brittney Spears dance number, \\"Scareface\\" reference, and flatulence jokes) were weak, animation and music was bland (I'm sorry, but even the inclusion of the Tom Waits song \\"Underground\\" couldn't save it), and the dialog and story were predictable.<br /><br />I can understand how kids under the age of eight might like a movie like this, but this isn't what I would consider \\"family\\" entertainment.  Hollywood has seemingly lost it's way, or else the public has either forgotten or simply expect less nowadays.  It's really too bad - the technology is so promising.<br /><br />Buy it for the kids if you must, but wait 'til it hits the cheap racks...
038572179X|5.0|I've not read a novel in a long time that is more likely to be read in literature classes in a century -- assuming, God willing, such things still exist.  McEwan is brilliant.  Had me laughing out loud through the seductive first chapter and weeping through the broken-French conversation much later.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure the resolution is TOTally satisfying, but somehow, it's right. Better than good. A sublime novel.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|After first seeing the televised version of Celtic WomAn on PBS I was recently compelled to buy the CD. Which is magnificent! Last night I attended the Celtic Woman concert at the Denver Convention Center and was mesmerized by not only the beauty and voices of the performers but the energy exhibited on stage was spectacular. These women love to sing!!! The five women performers were accompanied by very talented musicians. The percussionists are in a league of their own. My hat goes off to the brains behind the production Mr. David Downs. My hands are still sore from applauding an outstanding five star performance.*****
B000000IRL|4.0|This is by far my favourite Supertramp album and in my opinion their best ever album as well.  Now I already have the gold Mobile Fidelity version which is okay but not perfect sound quality wise and I am pleased to report that this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version is a major improvement in that department.  The sound quality is consistently better than the gold cd as the 2002 remastering from the original masters has certainly done the trick.  The mlps packaging though is not among the best that I've ever seen which is a pity as the content is very, very good.  There isn't a weak track or anything close to resembling filler material on this baby and to call this the de facto greatest hits compilation album of Supertramp is no exaggeration either.<br /><br />Whether by design or happy accident, this album reaches near musical perfection as that rarity where everything seems to fit perfectly from track order to the very nice flow of the tracks throughout the very pleasant listening experience.  This mlps version also includes a foldout containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese as well as a curious cardboard square resembling the centre circle of the original vinyl release.  All the tracks speak to you on so many levels and especially one of my favourite all-time tracks ever \\"Logical Song\\" is here as well.  As a great album should, all the tracks flow very well together as a cohesive, greater-than-the-sum-of-its-tracks package.<br /><br />Not among the better mlps releases in terms of design and assembly but the vastly improved sound quality from the Mobile Fidelity version and of course the impeccable musical content make this still a recommended purchase.
B0007GADZO|5.0|First of all, I have to admit that the kid in me screamed in total delight when I found out that Steve Vai came out with a new album.  I ran out and retrieved it as soon as it became available.  Also, I kept myself from listening to any samples of this CD - and that was the hardest thing to keep myself from doing!  I have, like most fans in here, have followed his work from his beginnings with Zappa, through Alcatrazz and so on and so forth. <br /> <br />I remember the feeling when I heard \\"Passion & Warfare\\" for the first time.  It was \\"Oh my f***!  What the hell did he just do?  I gotta rewind that!  (ah, the good ol' days of cassette decks)\\" I will now say that this feeling is back!  This album is amazing! <br /> <br />It's 15 years later and look how Mr. Vai has grown!  The crazy guitarman is still there, but he's matured.  All those sides of Steve Vai are still there, but there's more direction and emotion there than ever before!  And yes, I have isolated certain parts of his music, ran it through my PC and slowed it and stretched it out so I can try - the operative word there is \\"try\\" - to emulate his playing. <br /> <br />I will admit that \\"The Ultra Zone,\\" while having some bright spots here and there, wasn't Steve's best work.  My personal theory is, besides the clear balance in his spiritual and personal life, that his new band, The Breed, has challenged and invigorated him.  Not to say his old touring band didn't give him a run for the money, but there's this presence that is there now that wasn't before - just run the G3 clips side by side and it's there.  Whatever happened in the last 5 years, it certainly shows on this CD! <br /> <br />Throughout the CD, you go through Steve's amusement park.  He's got it all.  Rollercoasters, Tilt-o-whirls - the whole 9 yards! <br /> <br />As soon as you go through the gate, you get blown off your feet right away with \\"Building The Church\\" which first prepares you for the assault with that run of guitar/synth.  The, the riff begins.  Oh. My. God. That. Riff. <br /> <br />After that, you get Steve the park host who lays it all out with \\"Dying For Your Love.\\"  He takes you on a tour of the park.  I will say his singing has very much improved - now he can make his voice flow through some of the complexity of the music he makes - something he had a bit of trouble on with \\"Fire Garden.\\" <br /> <br />You move onto the various rides such as \\"Glorious,\\" \\"Firewall,\\" \\"Midway Creatures,\\" which equate to some of the best rides on the grounds.  You have the mellow rides (K'm-Pee-Du-Wee, I'm Your Secrets), and then you have the inevitable \\"Tunnel of Love\\" that is \\"Lotus Feet.\\" <br /> <br />It ends off with \\"Under It All\\" that prepares you for the next CD and the next chapter that is Real Illusions... <br /> <br />Overall, I would rate this a 4.75 out of 5 as \\"Dying For Your Love\\" never really caught me and sounded like something off of Firewall, but everything else was truly, truly amazing.  And as there is no 4.75, I am happy to put the 5 stars on this piece of work. <br /> <br />I guess if you aren't one who is into music for music's sake and likes a little experimentation from a true guitar master, then go for this.  Otherwise you can find what you're looking for on any Nickelback or Aerosmith record. <br /> <br />Oh, as for those who put down this work, you need to dig a little deeper and get past the days of David Lee Roth...Vai's grown up - so should you...

B0000508U6|1.0|Sorry all you hip, fashionable, Colplay fans -- but this CD sucks.  It's lackluster, banal, boring, and pretentious.   <br /> <br />You might like this album if: (1) you're an ultra-sophisticated fratboy (or girl) unwinding after a long night, (2) you're trying to fall asleep, or (3) you're not quite ready to enjoy Radiohead, but \\"Hey! This Coldplay is really cool!\\"   <br /> <br />Save your money.  Try Lamb of God instead.

0684824906|3.0|Reading Lincoln bios gives the reader the impression that he was either loved or hated by his biographers, with no in between. Goodwin gives an interesting overview of his leadership style but is again lauding his \\"genius\\" and seeming superior talent while ignoring obvious flaws. In fact, Lincoln was distrusted within his own administration, and alienated men who could have been allies with his convictions that whatever he did was morally right, such as the grandson of Francis Scott Key (composer of the national anthem), Francis Key Howard, the editor of the Baltimore Exchange.  Key was arrested by Lincoln and imprisoned at Fort McHenry. On September 13, 1861, and wrote:  \\"The flag which (my grandfather)  had then so proudly hailed, I saw waving at the same place over the victims of as vulgar and brutal a despotism as modern times have witnessed.\\"  When he was finally released on November 27, 1862 he wrote: \\"We came out of prison just as we had gone in, holding the same just scorn and detestation [for] the despotism under which the country was prostrate, and with a stronger resolution that ever to oppose it by every means to which, as American freemen, we had the right to resort.\\"<br /><br />Lincoln was indeed possessed of some political genius, which he showed in writing the Emancipation Proclamation, possibly the most impressive piece of propaganda ever composed. Lincoln issued this \\"edict\\" in 1862 and its sole purpose (far from freeing slaves) was to give the North a seeming moral high ground and thus keep England and France from granting foreign recognition to the Confederacy. In reading this document one must wonder who if anyone was freed, since it applied only to states currently in rebellion (meaning the Confederacy, where he had no authority) and the third paragraph goes on to specifically EXCLUDE northern slave states and territory retaken by the Union army. In answer, Lincoln actually freed no one at all.<br /><br />Goodwin glosses over Lincoln's racism with quotes from men such as Frederick Douglass while overlooking Lincoln's own writings. On June 26, 1857, Lincoln made an address in Springfield, Illinois, and stated, \\"A separation of the races is the only perfect preventive of amalgamation, but as immediate separation is impossible the next best thing is to keep them apart where they are not already together. Such separation, if ever affected at all, must be effected by colonization The enterprise is a difficult one, but 'where there is a will there is a way:' and what colonization needs now is a hearty will. Will springs from the two elements of moral and self-interest. Let us be brought to believe it is morally right, and at the same time, favorable to, or at least not against our interest, to transfer the African to his native clime, and we shall find a way to do it, however great the task may be.\\" Add this to yet another of his writings - \\"I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races -- that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races from living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race\\" and one must wonder about the man's true motivations.  Lincoln favored sending the freed slaves to Liberia and out of the United States altogether.<br /><br />Still, one cannot deny Lincoln's wisdom in delegation, appointing former rivals to positions of power, and his planned policy of reconciliation towards the south in the event of a northern victory. Perhaps one of the greatest tragedies to the defeated south was the murder of one who was their greatest friend as well as their greatest enemy. One wonders how history might read if events had been otherwise.<br /><br />Goodwin has added an excellent addition to other volumes on one of America's most famous presidents, but still one must hope that someday a biographer will give posterity a complete and unbiased opinion of the real Lincoln, faults and all. In the meantime historians must balance the pro and con works and continue to puzzle over the paradoxes of a very complex man.feated south was the murder of one who was their greatest friend as well as their greatest enemy.

B000002LEU|1.0|This band is recommneded because of New Order, unfortunately New Order is far superior.  Unlike most great bands I was not intrigued by theeir early work and it does not have a timeless sound.  I greatly enjoy The Cure, Depeche Mode and others from this same era but not Joy Division.  New Order fans skip this CD.
B000B5IPLK|3.0|I must admit that I am moderately impressed with this CD, and this is the first one that she has put out that I can say that about.  She is still way overrated though.  The strengths that Alicia does have lie mostly in her abilities as a performer, because she is really not of much a composer.  This CD gives her a forum that plays to her strengths.  I do give Keys some credit for actually injecting some emotion into her cover of Prince's \\"How Come You Don't Call Me Anymore\\" this time around, and \\"Fallin\\" where she, uh hem, subtlely borrows James Brown's \\"It's A Man's Man's World\\", comes across as even more heartfelt and sincere, but she is far from the virtuoso or musical prodigy that the Clive Davis hype machine makes her out to be.  For one thing, she struggles in playing rhythm and lead on the piano if the sections (the rhythm section in particular) are a step or two beyond rudimentary, but this is something that anybody who is touted as an exceptionally talented piano player should be able to do proficiently.  Alicia is a moderately skilled piano player but she is far from an especially gifted one.  There are better fairly contemporary piano players in the music industry.  Tori Amos for example is a much better piano player than Alicia Keys, but she doesn't have the record label/music industry hype machine touting her as an especially gifted pianist.  But, you don't have to be a virtuoso to be a compelling artist, so that is not even Alicia's biggest problem.  Her problem is that she has virtually no interesting or original ideas.  Her and Adam Levine's cover of The Rolling Stones' \\"Wild Horses\\" (off of their album, \\"Sticky Fingers\\") is decent, and so is her Gladys Knight cover \\"If I was your woman\\", but where are her own exceptional original ideas? (the Maybelline or actually it may be L'oreal commercial \\"inspired\\" `A Woman's Worth' doesn't quite cut it, even though I must admit that her performance of this song on this CD is a marked improvement)  \\"Fallin\\" isbasically an uncredited cover of a James Brown song,  \\"Diary\\" was created with Dwayne Wiggins from `Tony Toni Tone', and \\"You don't know my name\\" is produced by Kanye West and built on an obvious sample, so you want to explain to me once again how it is that Keys is so talented and creative?  Most of the performances of these songs are actually pretty strong which is why I still think that this album is worth buying, but she does almost nothing unique with the arrangements, which is even more evidence that she is lacking as a composer.  As far as the new single, \\"Unbreakable\\", numerous other hip hop and r&b acts scored moderate hits in the mid-nineties using that same Eddie Kendricks sample, so the idea is far from original, and the lyrics on this song are some of the lamest that I've heard from her, or anyone else for that matter ( I hope that this is not a signal of the direction that she is headed into because in spite of the things that I point out in this review, she actually does show promise on this release).  In general, as a lyricist, she is quite mediocre.  Her best stuff can't even hold a candle to Erykah Badu's or India Arie's just to name a few of her contemporaries.  She is FAR from an Aretha Franklin so I don't even know where that comparison comes from.  That's just downright absurd.  This CD is really not bad even if it seems that I'm making it sound that way, it's just that it's simply good for what it is:  the showcase of a moderately skilled young musician doing her thing and actually showing some promise this time around.  That's a message that the hype machine needs to take notice of.
1580086810|5.0|Aside from beautiful photography and a clean edit (both things we might expect from this pair), I was especially drawn to the family recipes. They connected me to the stories on a more basic historic level, made me look back to the photos for reference, and made me hungry to try them out myself. I think I might have to wait for a trip to St. Lawrence Island to work up the Greenlandic Seal stew, though I'm ready to get on a flight now.

Morning Glory <br />Nirvana - Nevermind <br />Pearl Jam - 10 <br />Guns N Roses - Use Your Illusion II <br /> <br />There, buy these 5 albums and just listen. This one, the Bends, I feel is Radiohead's best offer, even moresoe than the adored OK Computer. Songs like High and Dry and Fake Plastic Trees are nothing short of hypnotic. <br /> <br />
B000BB1MI2|5.0|As a professed fan of Roald Dahl, I eagerly awaited this movie, also eager to see more of Freddie Highmore-Johnny Depp after Finding Neverland. Being a bit spooked by Gene Wilder's presentation of the eccentric chocolate maker I hoped this one would provide a less scary experience. I was also aware that the original could flaunt a screenplay by the author himself, but I figured, you can't change that much, right? <br /> <br />Wrong. Turns out, you could change quite a lot. Living in a society that feels a need to attribute motive to everything, with the favorite by far being childhood trauma, this movie felt a neeed to follow. Willie Wonka, now not just an unchangable part of the factory, becomes a child wearing braces big enough to fit into a blue whale. Deprived of candy by his horror-inspiring dentist father who wields his tools not unlike lethal weapons, the young child's mind simmers with ideas of producing delecable candy to enjoy. Estranged from his father, Wonka builds his magnificent factory, and, influenced by Charlie's devotion to his family seeks out his father to make up. <br /> <br />But that's all. Other than that, it's still Dahl's twisted, crazed version of a child's dream come true. Grandpa Joe is as sprighlty as ever, the other three Old Ones just as ancient looking, and the cottage just as broken down. There's a lot of Highmore's frank and fresh acting as Charlie-his enthusiasm is highly catching, and Wonka played to near perfection by Depp. <br /> <br />Watch for the one-liners and other jokes floating around. (Given, I wathched this on too little sleep, so some jokes may not have been jokes at all). This is certainly a magical movie to enjoy!

B00005JNJV|5.0|{Some spoilers}: <br /> <br />Now, I'm not saying that all the other Batman films were that bad. But THIS....is darker than Spiderman. Dr. Jonathan Crane {Cillian Murphy} becomes more viscious than any other villain in a Batman film as the Scarecrow. His mask shoots out a harmful fear toxin that poisons the victim and makes them imagine that they are seeing something freaky. It gets worse when the Scarecrow spreads this stuff out all across Gotham City affecting everyone, and that it would destroy itself in fear, and Batman {Christian Bale} has to stop it. Both Christian Bale and Cillian Murphy pulled off their roles quite well for one being the hero and the other as the villain. The other actors were great too, including Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman.  <br /> <br />The movie starts with Bruce Wayne in Asia training in karate. However, when he gets back to Gotham City afterwards, it is overrun with crime. Then, he finds a batcave under a hole in the ground where he fell when he was just a child. This is where he decides to become what he is: Batman! Luscious Fox {Morgan Freeman} helps him build the equipment along with the batsuit. From here, he seeks out criminals, epecially the Scarecrow and that's how the whole toxin thing is started after Dr. Jonathan Crane tests it out on an inmate from Arkham Asylum and then Dr. Crane goes crazy and confronts Batman, but so does everyone else. It gets really, really awesome.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended. 5 out of 5 stars for a splendidly-made Batman movie that we've all been waiting for to see the lights of DVD.  <br /> <br />'Can't get enough of that Scarecrow! Excellent villain.   <br /> <br />
B000BBOUU4|5.0|As a professed fan of Roald Dahl, I eagerly awaited this movie, also eager to see more of Freddie Highmore-Johnny Depp after Finding Neverland. Being a bit spooked by Gene Wilder's presentation of the eccentric chocolate maker I hoped this one would provide a less scary experience. I was also aware that the original could flaunt a screenplay by the author himself, but I figured, you can't change that much, right? <br /> <br />  Wrong. Turns out, you could change quite a lot. Living in a society that feels a need to attribute motive to everything, with the favorite by far being childhood trauma, this movie felt a neeed to follow. Willie Wonka, now not just an unchangable part of the factory, becomes a child wearing braces big enough to fit into a blue whale. Deprived of candy by his horror-inspiring dentist father who wields his tools not unlike lethal weapons, the young child's mind simmers with ideas of producing delecable candy to enjoy. Estranged from his father, Wonka builds his magnificent factory, and, influenced by Charlie's devotion to his family seeks out his father to make up. <br /> <br />   But that's all. Other than that, it's still Dahl's twisted, crazed version of a child's dream come true. Grandpa Joe is as sprighlty as ever, the other three Old Ones just as ancient looking, and the cottage just as broken down. There's a lot of Highmore's frank and fresh acting as Charlie-his enthusiasm is highly catching, and Wonka played to near perfection by Depp. <br /> <br />  Watch for the one-liners and other jokes floating around. (Given, I wathched this on too little sleep, so some jokes may not have been jokes at all). This is certainly a magical movie to enjoy!
B00005JNJV|1.0|for all the time we have to spend following him around while he drifts aimlessly.  Very little Batman here, and what we do get of him.... well, here's some random points I'd like to make about the movie. <br /> <br />1. When did the batsuit make him start yelling like a WWF reject?  When he's not yelling, he slips into some strange '2 packs a day for 30 years' croak.  Sometimes the voice is so raspy you can close your eyes and picture him on the porcelain throne, straining as best he can.  You even wonder if he might be on the verge of defecating from his mouth, that is seriously how hard he is trying.  I'll wait for the super collecter's edition deluxe director's cut, when they redo the voiceovers to give him back his calm menacing voice.  For the time being, I am left to giggle and/or weep silently whenever he tries to talk while in the suit. <br />2. Nolan is a coward.  I think there are two scenes where he had the guts to make Christian Bale stand still and let us look at the costume for more than 1.3 seconds at a time.  I guess it doesn't matter, since there are only 11 minutes of screentime left when Nolan finally gets around to letting Christian Bale wear the goddamn costume to begin with.  Was he afraid the other kids would make fun of him?  Was he ashamed of how it turned out?  Even Scarecrow only puts his mask on for quick bursts, just barely long enough for, say, a fart to dissipate.  Scarecrow doesn't even have to sneak away and change into any kind of costume, that's how lazy Hollywood has become, people.  <br />3. Katie Holmes dials in a performance from the WB.  It's moments like her \\"It's what's on the inside that's on the inside\\" speech that make you weep for the centuries of intellectual development that have been wasted.  Later in the movie, when Batman regurgitates this gem past all of the bat phlegm stuck in his throat, you'll be forced to question whether mankind even has the right to exist anymore.  <br />4. This version of Bruce Wayne doesn'tneed justice and vengeance - he needs a support group and designer antidepressants.  Yeah, you fell down a well once, does it really take a ninja school for you to finally come to terms with that?  Are you crying?  There's no crying in Batman!  This Bruce Wayne isn't driven by a passionate obsession that fuels the grim exploration of his limits and capabilities.  This Bruce Wayne is a whining pansie who needs somebody to hold his hand and show him where the bathroom is.  When I'm watching a Batman movie, I should never feel like I want to pat him on the head and say \\"There, there.  Everything will be fine.  Have some warm milk... is that better?  Good, now get up off your can, put the damn costume on, beat some people up, and keep your mouth shut while you're doing it!\\"
B00000IQC8|1.0|This might possibly be,the most over-rated movie <br />in film history.Boring and mundane does not begin <br />to describe this garbage.The worst part really <br />belongs to the cinematography. <br /> <br />I understand the film was indie but jeez...they  <br />could have at least mentioned it was in black <br />and white. <br /> <br />I understand it was indie,but did they really <br />not have the ability to tape at a convenience store, <br />where the shutters were not closed because management <br />would not let them use it during regular hours. <br /> <br />There is very little to recommend it.It's just boring <br />crap paraded around as artsy-fartsy genius. <br />This might be more pretentious and over-appreciated <br />than Vincent Gallo's movies. <br /> <br />The only think I'm not sure of is which movie <br />is more boring and pointless,the Brown Bunny <br />or this.At least the Brown Bunny gave up some <br />un-necessary sex scenes.What does this have going <br />for it.Stupid dialogue and a bunch of <br />pale bastards standing about.It looks <br />very dated and 90's-ish. <br /> <br />Kevin Smith is a winner and is rich and has <br />a legion of admirers so there's not much I <br />can say to a man such as he.Despite this clearly <br />being boring crap.But,I know genius and this isn't <br />it.Mozart is genius,Handel's Messiah is genius. <br /> <br />Finally,the most disgusting part about this <br />movie is not that it is undeservedly successful, <br />or that I wasted $5 bucks renting it at blockbuster. <br />It's that a films main objective is to transport <br />you to a fantsy world you can't achieve or be, in real <br />life, or show something of interest not normally seen <br />in real life.This movie fails most in that respect. <br /> <br />It's actually more boring than real life,and that  <br />is an inexcusable sin for what's meant to be <br />entertainment????????????  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002AH9|5.0|This is literally the sound of Billie Holiday's heart breaking. She more than any other singer has always had the ability to reduce me to tears with her voice, but when listening to this set it's pretty much guaranteed that tears will come to my eyes. Her voice shows the wear and tear from years of drug and alcohol abuse, but she still manages to get to the essence of each song and uses the limitations of her voice to her advantage. In fact, the weariness in her voice helps to express the sentiments of lost love more effectively than if her voice had been in top form. I remember reading in the liner notes written by the producer that he had thought the recording was terrible after his first listen and he wasn't happy with Billie's performance. However, in time he was able to appreciate it. This may not be an easy listen, but this was Billie Holiday's favorite recording of herself for a reason.
B000ASATYO|4.0|Watch out for the review by Jack H. \\"Pink Floydian\\". SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS! This is a film with a lot of surprises and this bozo reveals the biggest ones in the first line or two of his review. Don't spoil this original treat of a movie for yourself. Don't read this goof's review. He likes the film and recommends it, but tells all the surprises. Watch the movie yourself and then come back and read the reviews. If you like humor, ghosts, and don't mind being shaken up a bit, this is a good movie. But it's full of twists that you shouldn't know about before you watch. Hey, Jack! SPOILERS! Get it?
068987474X|5.0|This book is not only very resource full, it is non-stop entertainment. It is hilarious and full of stories and little comments that make me laugh out loud, while still giving me a great insight on relationships and guys. It is also a confidence booster. Greg wrote this as a piece of encouragment for women who are, have been, or will be treated badly by the opposite sex. I recommend it to anyone.
0679882820|5.0|This is classic Dr. Suess in a board book format.  It is fun to read and sturdy all at the same time!  You can't go wrong with Dr. Suess: Kids and parents alike love the non-sensical rhythmic writing that has made Dr. Suess a classic author.
068981528X|5.0|I used this book to teach the concepts of point of view and author's purpose.  My 6th graders loved the story!  Plus they were learning at the same time -- even better!
B0001BS4Q0|4.0|Although I loved her voice on Zero 7's tracks, my first introduction to Sia's solo music was (like many other people) hearing the gorgeous, epic \\"Breathe Me\\" on the finale of Six Feet Under. Since then, I've listened to both of Sia's solo albums, and what really impresses me is the growth she's already shown. \\"Healing Is Difficult\\" was a pop/electronica album, accented by crisp, jazz-influenced vocals. The result was a sort of Lamb meets Esthero sound that worked okay, but didn't blow me away. \\"Colour the Small One\\" is a complete departure ... the sound is mellower, more organic and more mature. The songs are more contemplative and less obvious, and they give Sia's alluring alto room to breath and shine. I'm looking forward to hearing Sia's next effort.
0316666343|5.0|I was unsure about reading this novel, since it sounded rather depressing and I don't enjoy those types of novels.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  It did start out rather dark (as all books beginning with a murder do!) and while this unsettling theme continued throughout the book, the author did not dwell on it and instead gives the reader a clear picture of everyone dealing with the aftermath of her murder. <br /> <br />Alice Sebold does a brilliant job of writing - I literally could not put th novel down!  Think about whenever you've read about a murder in the newspaper; they never give you updates on what happens to the family.  This book does, and it is all interesting to digest and think about. <br /> <br />You know from the first chapter who the murderer is and just continue to root for the family to figure it out and for him to be caught.  It also makes you wonder what heaven is really like and if Susie Salmon's heaven could be yours as well.   <br /> <br />Only thing that didn't quite fit in this novel (at least for me, and I'm sure other people feel the same) is one particular scene where the author attempts to give Susie a last big hurrah... it just ends up strange to read and not as magical as the rest of the novel.  But put this scene aside, and the rest of it is pure genius.   <br /> <br />Read this - you won't regret it.  It is literally food for the mind!
B000AYNFWG|5.0|Well... the only thing I am not happy about is that I bought the 2-disc version 6 months ago... and now this!!! But anyway... in this era of new-editions-that-just-keep-on-coming-down (LOL) we all should be used to that by now. But basically, this is the same 2-disc edition with a 3rd disc containing extras that will not make me pop up my wallet (mainly because I got european and brazilian Fellini DVDs where I already have those added extras).<br /><br />But still it's great to know that such an important film like La Dolce Vita is getting a 3-disc treatment. I and very very very happy to know the DVD industry does care about the good films... the ones that really matter.<br /><br />This is one of the best and most important films ever made in film history by a director whose (I am sure) command of his art puts him easily at the same level as Hitchcock, Ford, Kurosawa and two or three others.<br /><br />ROME, 1959.<br /><br />The war is a thing of the past. Rome is now a bright city full of stylish, vain, beautiful, rich people parading around exotic nightclubs, private parties and hot spots. The Via Veneto is the place to be seen while driving a big american car. While the moon is high, morals are ... well... low.<br /><br />Marcello (Mastroiani) is a journalist who earns his living writing about the beautiful people. He goes where they go... and boy, how do they go!!! . He knows everybody... and everybody knows him. He may be just a guy earning a living... but he is there in the high life with the ones he write about: rich lonely women starving for sexual adventures, internatonal starlets with nothing to say and big apetite for wild parties, cheated husbands, princes, expensive prostitutes... you name it. He knows them all!<br /><br />But deep down, Marcello is frustrated and unfulfilled. His ambitions of being respected, of having a meaningful job, of leaving that shallow circle are constantly being destroyed by circumstances he cannot control.<br /><br />He is the perfect example of a character unable to make a stand and take control of his own life. For every effort he makes there's always the constant set back to the fact that he is just a stupid, cheap, selfish journalist covering stories that are only meaninful to those he write about... for a day or two.<br /><br />AND YET... it is all there: a woman who loves him, the old dream of writing a book, family and roots to be rediscovered, the understanding of the need to make a change of life... but he is too blind to see (or maybe he is too deep to jump out of that Dolce Vita).<br /><br />And every day is the same... parties, scandals, fights and sex. And just when Marcello starts to believe the change is possible... an old friend (someone who was his model of integrity and moral virtues - values Marcello dreamt for himself) murders his own family and commits suicide. ...The incomprehensible caos of life blows everything into a meaninglessness.<br /><br />...And that is too much to take. From then on... it's straight downward for Marcello who looses all his faith in truth, morality, hope and change. He allows himself to become a portrait of all the things he wanted to run away from.<br /><br />THIS IS ONE OF the most fascinating portraits ever put on celluloid. Everything is right in this masterpiece. The performers are top-notch with Marcello Mastroiani, Anouk Aimee, Anita Ekberg, Yvonne Furneaux, Alain Cuny, Nico and Lex Barker.<br /><br />Wardrobe (Oscar winner) and art direction by Piero Gherardi, cinematography by Otello Martelli, and music score by the legendary Nino Rota are more than perfect... and remind us about the few films who are lucky enough to have so many gifted professionals in peak form.<br /><br />The screenplay of La Dolce Vita is a masterclass in modern Cinema. The whole film is composed of episodes in the life of Marcello. Every episode follows a similar pattern: it starts as a promissing evening... develops Marcello's part in \\"the game\\"... add a sweet taste of a possible redemption (through love or honesty or truth)... goes on all night long...<br /><br />...and ends up by dawn with a bitter unexpected negative twist of fate, exposing the lies, disonesty, unsensitivity, coldness, humiliation, detatchment, death and all the evil that goes with Marcello's high life (and that's what makes the film title such a lesson in irony... the sweet life).<br /><br />That's how it is written: several episodes, each comprising about 15 hours in the beautiful/horrible life of Marcello - a man whose biggest enemy ends up being himself.<br /><br />One cannot say enough about the quality of La Dolce Vita and its importance to modern Cinema. The film remains today as it always was... an unsurpassed flawless gem that begs for a mature viewer... someone who can comprehend all its richness and detail... the wisdom and the irony. A viewer whose arms are big enough to get the whole thing... the whole film.<br /><br />Certainly it may feel difficult to follow for some viewers... but I think with a film like this... the problem lies with the viewer's ability to read all that's there. Like any great work of art, La Dolce Vita demands time and a close look. IT IS ALL THERE!!!  See it once, see it twice. A film like this comes once in a hundred years (next may be in 2060 - laughs!).<br /><br />AND NOW IN A 3-DISC EDITION!!!!!!!<br /><br />beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Fellini!<br /><br />We miss him so much!he game\\"... add a sweet taste of a possible redemption (through love or honesty or truth)... goes on all night long... <br /> <br />...and ends up by dawn with a bitter unexpected negative twist of fate, exposing the lies, disonesty, unsensitivity, coldness, humiliation, detatchment, death and all the evil that goes with Marcello's high life (and that's what makes the film title such a lesson in irony... the sweet life). <br /> <br />That's how it is written: several episodes, each comprising about 15 hours in the beautiful/horrible life of Marcello - a man whose biggest enemy ends up being himself. <br /> <br />One cannot say enough about the quality of La Dolce Vita and its importance to modern Cinema.

B0000042MY|5.0|I only recently purchaseed this score, and I LOVE it. It reminds of a bit of Hans Zimmer, and I'm not saying this ignorantly. I own Edelman, Jones, and Zimmer scores, so I would know the difference. The dramatic string-brass-synth mix reminds me strongly of \\"The Last Samuri.\\" Although The Last Samuri is a more emotional and dynamic soundtrack, this is pretty close to the same level. <br /> <br />Some tracks get your blood pumping, and others simply make you want to cry. This is one of the few soundtracks where I believe Trevor Jones outdid Randy Edelman, but hey, that's fine as long as the music is this awesome! <br /> <br />This is a great soundtrack, up there with, Gladiator, The Last Samuri, and Braveheart! <br /> <br />PLEASE VOTE ON THIS REVIEW :) <br /> <br />Media Lover
B000089RV6|5.0|Let's face it. If you are already a hardcore AC/DC fan, then you know how great this album is. If you are not an AC/DC fan, then all I can tell you is that this is the album which made AC/DC. Back in Black is to AC/DC what British Steel is to Judas Priest, what Destroyer is to KISS, or what Metallica (The Black Album) is to Metallica. This is simply their best album- every song ROCKS!!! When Back in Black was released in 1980, it revolutionized music. When I was 14, I bought the original LP album. When I bought my first car a few years later, I bought the cassette, and when the original CD version was released, I bought that too. I just purchased this remastered CD, and I have to say that it is excellent!!! DEFINITELTY 5 STARS!!!
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|There is at least one big misconception about BLOW-UP: it's not a film 'about' swinging 60s London, as it is usually characterized. It's not a critique or condemnation of that 'scene'. Antonioni--although his roots are in documentary--tends to use locations for their visual impact and whatever moods they may invoke and not, at least in his films of the 60s, to make political statements. He chooses the fashion scene of London because of its preoccupation with surface (literal surface, appearance) and with a primary-color palette. Thomas the photographer, (David Hemmings) seems to function as an 'artist' in this scene--recording the surface effect of what he sees--but he is very clearly not engaged with it artistically. It's something he does by rote, offhandedly and very importantly, without PASSION (as a number of famous scenes show. Ironically, these brief scenes of sexual titillation were exploited to sell the film as 'erotic', the very opposite of their intention within the context of the film).     The director had much of Thomas's neighborhood in the film repainted to intensify the bright, primary color scheme. A scheme in which red seems to dominate, but not symbolically. Red (as well as blue) just identifies Thomas's milieu. When the photographer goes into the park, he enters a world of green. Beautiful, almost intoxicating green (a real feature of the DVD transfer, by the way, is the brilliance of the color in this film). Green connects obviously to nature, even in a park landscaped by city planners. But, again, it's not really symbolic (Antonioni does not tend to use symbolism in any conventional sense, if at all, until perhaps the end of this film). Rather, green establishes this alternate environment where Thomas will make a significant discovery.    Earlier in the film, we meet Thomas's neighbor, a painter named Bill (John Castle) who introduces the notion of looking at a work of art and seeing something in it after it's complete (he demonstrates this inhis own painting). When Thomas develops his photos of Redgrave and her presumed lover in the park, he begins to notice other details that are far more interesting. This leads to an investigation that sort of encapsulates, or stands in for the long wandering segments of Antonioni's previous films: a gradual uncovering of some kind of knowledge or truth. What does Thomas discover? Perhaps that there's something under the surface of life that we don't want to think about, rushing around in our driven lives; perhaps it's mortality, or just something that SEEMS to be serious and important. When he pursues the investigation by going to see the actual body, the film takes on an almost sinister aspect. There is something primitive and slightly disturbing about the nearly silent scene of Thomas finding the body, accompanied only by the soft rustling of wind through the trees. He's shaken by it. But importantly, the whole experience has awakened a passion in him, not so much as an artist but as a human being. When the body has disappeared on his second visit, Thomas seems deeply disillusioned. Was any of this real? Does it matter if it was or not? But for a brief moment this jaded young man cared about something that did appear to be serious and important. The encounter with the mimes at film's end actually does seem symbolic, and it's a fairly obvious move on this director's part. Here's where it all gets so subjective. It's deliberately up for grabs: what, if anything , do the mimes stand for? Why does Thomas join their game and then disappear? To some, it's a surrender to the illusory nature of being, so complete that he no longer needs to even exist himself.     The DVD issue of BLOW-UP looks extremely good. The sheer visual beauty of the colors and images really gets its due. There is a critical commentary that leaves more questions than it answers and is among the least useful recorded for a challenging film of this kind.
B00005JOHO|4.0|I agree with a review or two preceding this one.  This film is an entertaining, enjoyable film however this film could have been much better by following the book more closely.  The film misses the much more interesting characterization of Vardon developed in the book.  It would have been nice if this film showed more of Vardon's life when he was young and what he went through as a young man. <br /> <br />I also wish this film could have shown the development of how Frances Ouimet got into the game of golf, where his \\"breaks\\" came from...more of his life.  For example, it would have been great for the movie to show that Francis and his brother first started playing golf on a makeship golf course behind their house.   <br /> <br />I think it would have been interesting, maybe more so to golfers, for the film to have incorporated more about the development of the golf ball and how Vardon resisted the new golf ball that was introduced towards the end of his career and how he resisted changing to the new golf ball. <br /> <br />I think the movie could have been much better by showing more of the clubhouse banter and spirit by the American players during the 1913 Open with the other professionals, particulary Walter Hagen, as depicted in the book and how one by one the American players fell back in the tournament until Ouimet was the only American with a real chance to win.  I also think that it would have been interesting to learn, in the movie, how professional golfers were treated back in the early 1900's, more of how Francis got into the Open, the nice way that his employer Wright and Ditson treated him, and particulary more true hole by hole scenes of the last round of the tournament and then the playoff. <br /> <br />Overall, a pretty good movie.  I'd recommened it without reservation, but as we may have often heard it said before.....the book is much, much better.  Go see the movie though....it is definitely worth seeing.
0307276902|1.0|Horrible, Horrible, Horrible.  Not only was it boring, but he doesn't know how to write.  He has no soul, gives no reason to care about him and left me feeling a little nauseated.  I've seen it all before, selfish people abusing people over and over again.  I was hoping he would just disappear and leave everyone alone.
B000002AT6|5.0|No music has ever touched me like this album--I have had it for years, and I think James Horner has written the most beautiful pieces of music--music that touches the nerves of your soul.  He brought this music from another place.   It makes me thankful for ears and  hearing--- and to be aware that there is a person who can pull this kind of music from his soul and have it so deeply and dearly touch mine--soul searing.
B00005TT77|3.0|... kudos to grandaddy for trying something different.  very very cool. <br /> <br />most of the rest are just shameful.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I had a blast lounging around the house in my PJ's watching this DVD series. I had missed a lot of episodes and this filled in the gaps. The show is hilarious, witty, intense and dramatic all at the same time! <br /> <br />The commentaries by Marc Cherry are excellent as are the other bonus features. Watching the DVD set gave me a new appreciation for the quality of the show's writing. Plus it's just plain fun because once one episode ends you can just pop in another! <br /> <br />This is a great investment even if you want to watch the DVD's once and then resell them.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Pearl Jam's fourth album \\"No Code\\" is perhaps the most underrated album in the legendary Seattle groups' catalogue. It was released in the fall of 1996, after the height of grunge, and after the heyday of Pearl Jam's mass popularity. Had it come out just a year or two earlier, it probably would have made more of an impact. As it is, it sold reasonably well, but failed to match the popularity of its three predecessors.<br /><br />Pearl Jam has never made an album quite like \\"No Code\\" before or since. Although it definitely sounds like Pearl Jam, \\"No Code\\" incorporated a world-beat sound into many of the album's songs. Neil Young's influence on Pearl Jam is also clearly evident on this album. If you were expecting a straight-forward rock album like \\"Ten,\\" or \\"Vs.,\\" you'd be disappointed with \\"No Code.\\" Although this album is highly regarded among the Pearl Jam faithful, it sort of slid under the radar and has never received the acclaim or admiration that it deserves.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes\\" starts the album out with a whimper rather than a bang. Although repetitive, it never gets monotonous. It's a rather off-beat eerie ditty, and Eddie Vedder's underwhelming vocals give the song the perfect effect. The album then jumps into an all-out assault with the blistering \\"Hail Hail,\\" probably the most old-school sounding Pearl Jam rocker on the album. The album slows down, without loosing momentum for the subdued \\"Who We Are.\\" It's simple, yet elegant, and has a really catchy melody that stays with you. It leads perfectly into the off-beat \\"In My Tree,\\" which although couldn't have been a radio staple or single, is essential to the overall flow and vibe of the album. \\"Smile,\\" is perhaps one of Pearl Jam's most underrated songs. This one is definitely very Neil Young-ish. The harmonica solos are a very nice touch. \\"Off He Goes,\\" is sort of like a follow-up to \\"Better Man,\\" (from Vitalogy, 1994). Although the former is more subdued, laid-back, and the guy is the jerk. The pace is picked up a bit with the hard-rocking \\"Habit.\\" The Neil Young-ish mid-tempo \\"Red Mosquito\\" features one of Eddie Vedder's best vocal performances. The intense \\"Lukin\\" is cool, but not one of the album's highlights, but its fast pace adds a little spice to the album. \\"Present Tense\\" is, in my opinion, the album's true highlight. It starts out very simple and serene, picks up, and then ends with a gorgeous outro. Its message, about moving on and not reliving past regrets is something that everyone can relate to, and this song helps remind us that we're all human. The infectious \\"Mankind,\\" sung by guitarist Stone Gossard is a really cool, underrated rocker. The mellow, semi-bohemian \\"I'm Open,\\" has some cool spoken poetry that works well for the song. It would be very easy for a song with open poetry to sound pretentious, but this doesn't. The album closes with the subdued \\"Around the Bend,\\" a perfect way to conclude the album.<br /><br />The band and the songs sound tight, yet there is certain looseness to them. The album is well-paced and thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.<br /><br />Among the general masses, Pearl Jam will probably be best remembered for their first three albums, but their fourth album \\"No Code,\\" might very well contain their finest collection of songs.

The intense \\"Lukin\\" is cool, but not one of the album's highlights, but its fast pace adds a little spice to the album. \\"Present Tense\\" is, in my opinion, the album's true highlight. It starts out very simple and serene, picks up, and then ends with a gorgeous outro. Its message, about moving on and not reliving past regrets is something that everyone can relate to, and this song helps remind us that we're all human. The infectious \\"Mankind,\\" sung by guitarist Stone Gossard is a really cool, underrated rocker. The mellow, semi-bohemian \\"I'm Open,\\" has some cool spoken poetry that works well for the song. It would be very easy for a song with open poetry to sound pretentious, but this doesn't. The album closes with the subdued \\"Around the Bend,\\" a perfect way to conclude the album.     The band and the songs sound tight, yet there is certain looseness to them. The album is well-paced and thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.     Among the general masses, Pearl Jam will probably be best remembered for their first three albums, but their fourth album \\"No Code,\\" might very well contain their finest collection of songs. Hopefully future generations of fans will discover \\"No Code\\" and it will be better appreciated, as it truly is a great album.
080012166X|5.0|This is a classic film, which refers closely to the original novel. If you love gothic romantic films this will be perfect for you. It is visually stunning with an evocative soundtrack that seamlessly engages your emotions. I absolutely loved the scene where the count(Oldman) first meets Mina(Ryder)in the picture theatre and almost immediately they are drawn to each other dispite the fact that mina tries desperately to resist the count. Francis Ford Coppella weaves a beautiful story, with tiny incisions of horror,breathtaking backdrops, and costumes. By the end he leaves us totally consumed by the romantic tragedy. The film was so wonderful I feel like picking up a copy of Bram stoker's Dracula and reading it again. And Gary oldman is totally charming in the Lead. A definitely must see movie!!
B00005QW5X|5.0|A popular off-Broadway cult hit in the late 90s, a motion picture version of John Cameron Mitchell's \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" finally saw a release in 2001. Only four years since it was released as of this writing, the film has already achieved legendary status. Along with \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\\" (1975) \\"Tommy\\" (1975) and the newcomer \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" (1998), \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" is regarded as a rock n' roll movie classic.<br /><br />Why has \\"Hedwig\\" achieved such adoration as well as critical acclaim? What is it, exactly; do people see in this movie? What's the appeal? Many other reviewers and sources have detailed descriptions of the plot, so I won't go into a detailed synopsis. Instead, I will state why I personally love this movie.<br /><br />\\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" has been labeled \\"gay camp,\\" or otherwise an empowerment of gay culture and identity. While this is true, \\"Hedwig\\" is much more than that. \\"Hedwig\\" transcends being a gay cult film. While it is a film that celebrates diversity and sexuality, it mostly celebrates being true to yourself, of accepting yourself for who you are. Hedwig (Mitchell) uses what she \\"has to work with,\\" just like everyone. No matter whom you are or what your sexuality is, there is a little bit of Hedwig in everybody.<br /><br />A major theme of \\"Hedwig\\" that so many can relate to is unrequited love. She spends her whole life, every waking moment searching for her \\"other half.\\" She thinks it may be Tommy, or maybe Yitzhak?<br /><br />The way in which the movie plays out is pure enchantment. The colorful cinematography, illustrations, musical score, anecdotes, and songs are a delight to all senses. From the gummy bear scene, to the food fight, to the singing in the oven, to the band of Korean housewives, to the grand finale, every scene is mesmerizing.<br /><br />As we witness Hedwig's formative years, to her failed marriage, to her preoccupation and obsession with Tommy Gnosis, we are taken on a journey. It is a ride through anticipation, melancholy, anger, joy, and ultimately self-discovery.<br /><br />\\"Hedwig\\" is a film that can be enjoyed on many levels. It can be enjoyed as camp and pure entertainment, or can be analyzed for deeper meaning. That makes it a film worth owning that can be seen again and again. Every time I watch this movie I pick up something new, or rethink a particular scene or line. This movie will make you laugh, make you sing, and make you think.<br /><br />Stephan Trask's songs are absolutely incredible. The songs in this film are as good as any of the bands they were inspired from (Lou Reed, David Bowie, Iggy Pop). As soon as I saw this film I had to buy the soundtrack and it remains a favorite of mine.<br /><br />The supporting cast is great. Miriam Shor gives an outstanding performance as Hedwig's lover Yitzhak, Andrea Martin as the dedicated agent, Ben Mayor-Goodman as a young Hedwig, and Michael Pitt as the bewildered Tommy.<br /><br />The DVD has a lot of cool extras that should please fans of the film.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|Absolutely superb CD!  I've always been a fan of Depeche Mode, but was very disappointed with their last album (Exciter).  This has some spunk to it and makes you want to dance!  I just love this CD and continue to play it over and over.  I enjoyed it right off the bat, but it grows on you more and more as you listen to it.  'Precious' is one of my favorite tracks from the CD, but altogether I can't find one song on this CD that I don't like.  Great job my fellow guys from Basildon, Essex (that's England, you know)!  I highly recommend this CD to any Depeche Mode fan.
B00068V384|5.0|The review of this live performance in 1995 expains it all: <br /> <br />\\"What fire, what enthusiasm has been kindled in two weeks of intense preparation under Celididache!....The unworldly transition into the 'Lacrimosa', the baroque joy of the 'Domine Jesu', the sweeping melodic power of the 'Quam olim Abrahae', and (in the Introitus) an opening that comes from another world, so definitive but so removed from all personal desires - what we experienced here surpassed all description.  We must suppose, indeed, that we will never again hear this work in all its perfection.\\" <br /> <br />Eventhough a recording can only transmit a small percentage of what actually happens in a live performance, we are fortunate that this performance reached such heights that a small percentage of still overwhelms any other record.  This is Celibidache's genius at its finest and you'll be hard pressed to find a better performance of a symphonic chorus on record than this one.

0425180638|4.0|The Scarpetta of The Last Precinct is a far cry from the irritably independent woman of previous books. Her often over-inflated musings are more tiresome than tantalizing. Cornwell's impressive track record makes this excursion a bit disappointing,but as a loyal fan I would still read the next, but I dont think she is at her best here.
0440234743|5.0|He does it again.  Somehow he keeps writing them and I keep buying them.  Grisham has a way of making you relate to the characters and feel their pain and suffering as well as their joy.  It's always good to see rich people squirm, but a welcome reprive to see people like Rachel could actually exist and live their lives for something more than just money.   <br /> <br />Anthony Wilbon, Author of \\"The Enigma of Njama\\"
B0006FFRW0|5.0|If you want the review of the music itself, you might as well check out the page for the regular copy. Everyone knows it's great. As for the surround, it's good for a change of pace, and it gives the songs a fresh feeling, but it doesnt take long before you're longing to flip it over and just listen to the stereo version. Maybe it's because my surround system isn't high-end, but the surround version just isn't quite as good for everyday listening. It's great for sitting back in the dark and immersing yourself in all of the little details that have been blasted into full audibility, but from what I've experienced, the songs lose a good deal of catchiness and listenability in the surround format. I enjoy listening to the surround version on rare occasions, and I think it's easily worth the small price increase, but for my everyday listening, nothing beats stereo.
0393327655|5.0|This is a terrific book about the dangers of religion in an increasingly threatening world of religious extremists. The author tackles more than just Islamic fundamentalists (and the entire Moslem culture), which he claims (not in so many words, mind you) are morally inferior, but also Christians, Jews, and just about every other religion. He goes on to describe why Christianity is against euphoria-inducing drugs and why the modern-day creation of Isreal is not about helping Jewish people establish a homeland but rather about ushering in the Day of Judgement. A lot of lucid, well-thought, well-written material here, even if it does get off the track at times. The author keeps a remarkable even tone throughout the book, and is fair-minded. It's not often you have a book that criticizes both Noam Chomsky & George W. Bush!
B00097A5HW|5.0|Listen to it... you will feel all the effort Shakira put into this beautiful record. My personal opinion, Shakira is a genius making her unique latin music. If you ever have the chance to see her live on concert DONT miss it!
B00005MIZU|5.0|I certainly disagree with the last review. Maybe for some people Muti's Schubert is at the first glance not 'deep' enough. But I have never heard the symphonies in such a joyful manner, with fast tempi all the way. And the Wiener Philharmoniker here clearly show why they are regarded as one of the finest orchestras of the world: their performance is close to perfection. -- Highly recommended!
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Even as I type this, I'm surprised at how decent this album is.   <br />A fan since '86, I've followed DM through their highs and lows, loving their albums upto-and-including \\"SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION\\", and then watching the bottom drop-out. <br />While I was able to find a few worthwhile songs on \\"ULTRA\\" (mainly 'HOME'), I could find little to celebrate in the bland, music-by-numbers \\"EXCITER\\" (ha! ironic title). <br /> <br />I suppose lowered expectations come into play here, but I must say this new album is a wonderful surprise.  Many of the songs feature those gooseflesh-inspiring minor-key changes that recall past masterworks like \\"BLACK CELEBRATION\\" and \\"VIOLATOR\\". The sound-production might be a bit over the top, but the songwriting is better than we've seen in a while. <br />Dave's voice, as well, is better than we've heard in quite a while. I had been very impressed with the quality of his singing on the single 'PRECIOUS', and sure enough that quality extends to the whole album. <br /> <br />SO in the end I'd give it 3.5 stars out of five - it isn't VIOLATOR, but it is much better than we've heard from the 3 remaining members (plus a giant production team!) in a while.  Wish the songs were a bit less 'busy' production-wise (not every song needs 1,000 industrial blips-and-bleeps in the background), and the album is sorely missing a beautiful, aching ballad.  But otherwise, my hat is off to the group -- welcome back. <br />
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|From start to finish I was completely blown away. I'm still not quite sure where to start. This CD may well be better than Whisper Supremecy and None So Vile! The drums are loud and upfront, with unbelievable speed and complexity. The guitars are unbelievable! This album is absolutely crushing. My jaw was on the floor the entire 25 X I played the CD in one day! Yes I actually counted. As we all know this album brings back the mighty Lord Worm to his rightful place as lead vocalist. This concept album is not another CD full of singles, this is a CD that you must listen to the whole way through, and even then you may not grasp this album! This is so good. Highlights on this CD is everything! This CD is as close to perfection as a band can come. They got heavier, more technical, and more insane. This is easily the best release of 2005. Buy this NOW!!!!!
B00030590I|4.0|^^That pretty much says it all.  The plot is interesting and engaging as well, but by far I just love the beautiful use of colors to portray moods and feelings in this movie.
B00005JNJV|2.0|It is an average action movie. People that give it 5 stars<br /><br />submit to mass hypnosis. Fight scenes are very choppy and<br /><br />ugly shot - Chris Nolan could learn a thing or two from<br /><br />movies like \\"Hard-Boiled\\" or even \\"Kungfu Hustle\\".<br /><br />Dialog is juvenile and boring. Parts of the plot are<br /><br />utterly ridiculous - as a boy Batman was scared of bats so<br /><br />now he travels to Tibet to confront his fears. Cinematography<br /><br />is pretty good - that and few SFX saves that movie - otherwise<br /><br />it is pretty empty shell of action movie.
0385510454|1.0|Too many holes - slow paced - hard to believe this is written by such a talented author.  Didn't buy this for lessons in Italian or travelogue.  Big disappointment.
B0009YA37W|5.0|A very solid debut album that ranks with the best of them - what I found interesting is that, just as other reviewers have noted, not only can you hear the early 80's influence of bands like Joy Division, The Cure, Echo & The Bunnymen, The Sound and The Chameleons but at first listen, a near forgotten band from 1990 came to my mind - Kitchens of Distinction - actually, I think the Kitchens vocalist was a greater influence on Interpol and the Editors then Ian C or Ian M - If there's anyone out there that agrees, I'd like to read it!
B00007KWI9|4.0|Here's a thought, a crazy, \\"THIS REVIEW WAS NOT HELPFUL TO ME\\" vote-garnering thought guaranteed to enrage devoted Yes fans: Yes was better as a COVER band than as songwriting group.     (Blasphemy!)    Okay, maybe that's over the top (I used to dislike 'high prog' Yes, but have since grown to really appreciate them), yet it taps into something that's desperately underappreciated by the ultra-serious true believer Yes fans who regularly meditate to \\"The Revealing Science Of God.\\" Something maybe visible only to someone who approached this group from an initially skeptical perspective.      And that's the fact that their first two albums are a heck of a lot of fun, and it's because the cover tunes are the best tracks on them. Have you heard their prog-defilement of West Side Story's \\"Something's Coming?\\" (It was originally the B-side of \\"Sweetness,\\" and now it's presented here as a bonus track.)  It's hilariously satisfying: genial, intentionally witty, and rife with crazy rubber-room arranging decisions. You know they're being completely tongue-in-cheek given the way Jon Anderson breezily dances through the fey lyrics (which fairly scream \\"SHOWBIZ!\\") while Chris Squire and Pete Banks take the originally dainty music and ruthlessly reshape it into a concussive, hammering display of pyrotechnical chopsmanship. (At least I hope to god they're kidding around...)    If you can get into this sort of playful-yet-showoffy vibe, then I suspect you'll enjoy this album regardless of what you think you know about \\"classic\\" Yes. The band-written tracks on the debut are mostly decent, but it's on the covers that the real charm of the early lineup shines: their jazz-rock deconstruction of The Byrds' \\"I See You?\\" I love it, especially because it's a really obscure - yet excellent - Byrds song that deserved greater exposure.     And man, even if you think Anderson and his Yes-men were a bunch of humorless bores after 1972 or so, I defy you to tell me they aren't enjoying the HIGH HOLY HECK out of themselves on \\"Every Little Thing.\\" Yes, that \\"Every Little Thing.\\"  The old Beatles song from 1964. I love the way they have utterly NO respect for The Beatles' \\"mystique\\" - they tear this sucker apart and reassemble it in a completely different way. You know that it's all in good fun after Peter Banks throws in that \\"Day Tripper\\" riff near the beginning. In fact, this might get me tarred and feathered in Liverpool, but I PREFER this to the original Beatles version: it's a stone riot, and easily the best song on this album.    As for the self-penned tracks here, they're pretty little things, if sometimes insubstantial. \\"Survival\\"'s whole evolution theme is a warning sign of things to come (to quote David Byrne), but it's a good song, while \\"Sweetness,\\" and \\"Yesterday And Today\\" are fun, inoffensive numbers with thoughtfully-written melodies. Aside from the obvious standouts like \\"Looking Around\\" and \\"Beyond And Before,\\" I find \\"Harold Land\\" to be a real shocker coming from Yes: lyrics that not only make perfect sense, but manage to move me a bit. As far as preachy anti-war songs go, this one has a very nicely observed lyric, something which you'll unfortunately never hear in a Yessong again.    Overawing instrumental virtuosity - which many critics of prog complained endlessly about back in the day - only becomes aggravating when you get the sense it's there merely for its own sake, an exercise in indulgent self-amusement. When it's put to benign use like this, however, everybody wins. Moreover, everybody wins with this fantastic Rhino re-issue, which is easily the most essential of the new bunch.  The sound is significantly improved over the older Atlantic remaster, and the bonus tracks are much more substantial and valuable than those on any of the other reissues.  The early versions of \\"Dear Father,\\" (in particular the \\"first version,\\" which is sequenced second) are markedly superior to the released one, while \\"Something's Coming\\" is, as I discussed at the beginning, an essential part of the Yes canon.    So this is Yes as they began. And darnit, it's Yes as I wish they would have stayed, for at least a little while longer. Don't get me wrong: I'm glad they eventually transformed into the band that gave us such fantastic (albeit lyrically indecipherable) albums as The Yes Album, Close To The Edge, and Going For The One.  But you know...I sure wouldn't have minded a few more LPs like this one as well.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|This CD musically shines from the first note to the final track. By way of this release, Williams artistically \\"comes out\\" and should be officially declared the first musical legend of the new millennium.<br /><br />Amazingly, his previous products were ignored by North American radio. However his masterful pop compositions such as ANGEL became major hits on North America radio once a \\"GRADE D\\" overexposed peroxide female vocalist butchered the song and placed it as an add on track to boost the weak sales of her poorly reviewed CD.<br /><br />This time, Robbie's product could become Robbie's first major global breakthrough CD.<br /><br />North America radio will have no option but to pay attention to the quality of the musical content found on this product.<br /><br />The CD bridges the \\"newglam\\" production value of Scissor Sister to a melodic sensitivity of Elton John compositions created during his glory days in the early 1970s.<br /><br />All songs on this release are produced as possible radio tracks making it very hard for the listener to select one favorite track, nevertheless, I remain partial to: Ghost, Spread Your Wings, Your Gay Friend and Random Acts of Kindness.<br /><br />If you really want to discover a CD that has listening power from beginning to end then I truly urge you to give this product a chance.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.
B00007KWHO|2.0|Hey, who spilled orchestra all over my early Yes?    So apparently somebody in the Yes camp decided that the band just wasn't substantive enough as a self-contained unit, and that what it needed to really take off was a generous slathering of strings, in order to...geez, I dunno, certainly not to bring out the rockin' side of the band. After all, everybody knows that what rock 'n' roll really needs to become an artistically valid musical form is classical music, right? (And then Emerson, Lake & Palmer came up with the even MORE brilliant postulate that what classical music really needed to make it respectable was rock 'n' roll. Prats.)    And well...the result is weepy twaddle like the all-orchestral \\"Clear Days\\" or fruity arrangements of otherwise decent songs like \\"Then,\\" which have all the subtlety of a nail-studded plank to the forehead. (Even worse, the orchestral call-and-response figure on the verses of \\"Then\\" is out of synch with the band by a few milliseconds, something which is - trust me -  quite noticeable and extremely grating).     On the other hand, I will grant that the orchestrations, for all of their utter garishness (in fact, because of them) work on \\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed.\\" Although I'm not familiar with the original, I'll eat my watch if it's 1/10 as exciting as this version, which is splendidly overwrought in the same tradition as their covers of \\"Every Little Thing\\" and \\"Something's Coming,\\" and an attention-grabbing way to open the album. I remember hearing this song for the first time, on the old Yesyears boxed set: Tony Kaye fires up that great crusty late-Sixties organ, and then out of blue comes...the STRINGS! Goofy, silly strings, ostentatious violins, brass flourishes and all of it pushed up in the mix, flailing around wildly, so unsubtle as to be charming.  So I'm listening to this circus unfold, thinking exactly the following words: \\"Cripes, I'm expecting 'How The West Was Won' to break out any minute here.\\"AND THEN IT DID.    No really, IT DID. The band tumbles into the instrumental break, Banks takes a muted guitar solo, and then suddenly it's Western Movie Night at the prog cinema in another one of those great early Yes moments that they just plain ol' forgot how to do later in their career.    I also enjoy the puppy-eyed \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and the Peter Banks how-do-ya-do of \\"Astral Traveller,\\" but frankly Time And A Word suffers in comparison to either its predecessor or what would follow. There's simply too much tripe like \\"Clear Days\\" and \\"The Prophet,\\" to say nothing of the thoroughly childish \\"Time And A Word,\\" which ruins a decent melody and a winner of a bass line with moron-simple lyrics (to quote Christgau: answer to title quiz = \\"now\\" and \\"love.\\") and orchestration that fails to do anything except accentuate their emptiness. After this album was recorded, the band got tetchy and dropped Pete Banks.  It's hard to say that Steve Howe's arrival didn't take the group on to bigger and better things, given the weakness of half of this album (my rating would be 2.5 stars if I could do it), but I miss this era of the group nevertheless.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Bob Dylan has always been a contradiction and this excellent Scorcese documentary connects the earnestness and depth of the songwriting Dylan with the playful and elusive public persona.   <br /> <br />If there were any criticism, I would say there was not enough music presented in its entirety (some musical cuts were too short; others were spoiled by voice overs).  However, the film as a whole is great.   <br /> <br />As someone who lived through the period designing posters and saw Dylan both at the Club 47 Mt. Auburn in Cambridge and at Gerde's Folk City in the Village, I especially enjoyed seeing Dave Van Ronk talking about the times.  It would have been nice to see Van Ronk in context - singing \\"St. James Infirmary Blues\\" or \\"He was a Friend of MIne\\" to further the connection. <br /> <br />But there is only so much time availble in a two-hour format, and I feel that this will be the definitive Dylan film for some time to come.  I hope there will be a sequel to bring \\"Zimmy\\" through the early years of this century as well. <br /> <br />Eric Engstrom
B000084T18|1.0|Consider the following: Marvin Gaye and John Lennon each get shot once or twice and they die.  This loser gets shot nine times...AND LIVES!!??  What has he contributed to the world?  Gaye and Lennon both wrote excellent music.  They wrote form the heart and...My God their songs actually had substance and a melody!  They did not believe in violence and while they did a few foolish things in their lives they were blessed and will always be remembered. <br /> <br />    This guy does foolish things everyday if not every second.  He writes from his underdeveloped and violent mind rather than his heart, or if he does write from his heart it must he must have a very black heart indeed. Sadly his beliefs that violence, gangs, drugs, sex, and the objectation of women are acceptable have gained him millions of followers who apparently find this stuff to be \\"cool\\" and \\"hip\\".   <br /> <br />    I am not entirely against rap.  Once upon a time rap music was a serious and major cultural influence.  It had many political and social vaules.  Just listen to songs like Grandmaster Flash's, \\"The Message\\", or Public Enemy's, \\"Fight The Power\\", and you'll get the idea.  Back then rap actually had substance and vaules.  Then it morphed into modern Hip-Hop and it's all been down hill since then.  Now rappers rap about how rich and dangerous they are and how they can kill and have sex with anyone they want but no one will care because they are so cool and, \\"in\\". <br /> <br />    At 18, I guess I suppose to like this crap because this is what the kids all listen to...WRONG!!!  Unlike Run-DMC or even Emimen, 50 Cent has no power when he raps.  He just mumbles and uses every slang and profane word he can think of.  But profanity and absurd slang is supposed to be, \\"cool\\", so that's why his songs top the charts.  The background, \\"music\\", is absurd too.  Its just the same video game music looped over six milllion times for the whole duration of the song. <br /> <br />    If you want real music, buy a Beatles, Elvis, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Michael Jackson, or even Madonna album.  If you want real rap, buy a Grandmaster Flash, Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, LL Cool J, or even Eminem CD.  Stay away from this like it were AIDS or some other STD.  Buy the way, whoever decided that the word, \\"pimp\\", should mean to be cool and hip needs to be dragged out into a street and shot nine times!!!.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|Wow this is a great CD.  He is definitely continuing to mature musically (which you could see on Love Somebody from Escapology).  I think it's very admirable that he is really trying to expand and grow and isn't attempting to pander to the teenybopper crowd.  I'm sure some of his fans may not be happy there isn't a real traditional pop song, but I am thrilled with Intensive Care, especially \\"Make Me Pure\\", \\"Spread Your Wings\\", \\"Advertising Space\\" and \\"Place to Crash\\".  He's really a great talent.
B000065VA1|5.0|Peter Gabriel took progressive rock to new levels when he was with the group Genesis.  He was no less lucrative when he went solo during the latter half of the 70's  His solo albums rewrote what pop music was and could extend to.  His genius, however, wasn't fully put into effect untill he released his breakthrough album, \\"So\\", in 1986. <br /> <br />The album combines the ambitions and artistry of 70's progressive rock with the commercial and popularity attributes of 80's pop music.  Gabriel's lyrical themes cover many aspects of life from love and romance to family vaules to career dreams to simple artistic beauty.  Not once does he fall flat or fail to express himself completely and honestly.    <br /> <br />The album opens with the track, \\"Red Rain\\", a haunting pop tune about the terror and destruction of mankind's wars and selfishness.  Red rain is the blood of those innocent lives that were destroyed because of it.  The next track is, \\"Sledgehammer\\", one of the more brighter songs that Gabriel has done.  The song is basically just Gabriel having fun with its nonsense lyrics and catchy pop melody.  The video to this song is a classic with its flashy special effects and timeless stop-motion animation.  Track three is one of the most heartbreaking song ever written by Gabriel or just about anyone else.  A duet with Kate Bush, the song is about one of the most important aspects of human life, family.  Gabriel tells how he failed his friends and family while Bush tells him that's its alright and not to give up on them.  The next track is the only other song about romance other than the closing track.  A simple tune about how his lover's voice is the only thing that keeps him going. <br /> <br />\\"Mercy Street\\", is about a girl named Anne who apparently lost everything and now dreams of how she can once again find mercy in her father's arms.  \\"Big Time\\", is about the dream of making it big in the city and becoming famous.  \\"We Do What Were're Told\\", is a very short and simple tune about a nation who thinks with one mind and has one goal (possibly about communism).  \\"This Is The Picture\\" is another simple number about finding artistic beauty in simple things like flying birds and falling snow.  The album end with one of the more intelligent love ballads to come out in recent years.  The song is about how complete and honored Gabriel is to be in his lovers eyes.  The song with its unfogettable bass line and world beat drums and chants has became an instant classic. <br /> <br />I cannot think of any progressive-rock albums that have come out since this one did in 86.  Sadly this very well may have marked the end of one of the most influential rock styles to ever appear on the music scene.  This is another album you cannot go wrong with.  If you like intelligent lyrics and artistic melodies you will love this album.

Named for original Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green's breathtaking blooze instrumental (he also composed BLACK MAGIC WOMAN), here's the album that rescued the entirely deserving Carlos Santana from endless classic rock tour pergatory. Not since Tina Turner's \\"I've still got legs\\" comeback in the 80s has the music world witnessed such an unexpected and satisfying resurrection, thanks to the Clive Davis notion of pairing Mexico's guitar guru with a half dozen young disciples. The catalyst was SMOOTH, a blistering, funk-fried Rob Thomas collaboration that knocked doldrums-drenched radio on its keister at the turn of the century, culminating in the Grammy's most decorated album ever. Since Santana has always employed a wide palette of musical styles and vocalists (from Journey's Gregg Rolie to Buddy Miles to John Lee Hooker), hearing him jam on hip-hop, jazz-rock, and rap in tandem with Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews, and Everlast is not such a far fetched notion. When the musical history books are written, SUPERNATURAL will remain proof positive that, yes Virginia, there really IS a Santana clause.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE FIESTAS

B000AYEIZY|5.0|I was one of the lucky ones who got to see the much anticipated CREAM reunion show at Madison Square Garden in New York City this week.  It was a night of spectacular music, proving that even though Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton are well in their 60's, the magic and flare of their career together sounds just as strong as it must have sounded in the late 1960's. <br /> <br />For myself, a man of 38-years old, who has only been able to follow Clapton's solo career, it was a rare change to see the harder, edgier side of his legendary guitar work.  Jack Bruce's voice definately sounded aged, but what can you expect?  He has aged.  He pulled off the songs beautifully, nonetheless.  Ginger Baker...where do I begin?  Neil Peart, Carl Palmer and Ginger Baker!  The rest of the world's drummers can all go home!  Although, I should add that Baker can't sing to save his life?  Perhaps that wasn't even singing he was doing during \\"Pressed Rat & Warthog\\". <br /> <br />As for this CD, the shows at the RAH in London pretty much matched the shows at the Garden, both in sound and in set list.  Those at the New York shows were treated to \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\", which is not on the RAH cd or dvd. <br /> <br />The concert is pure CREAM listening pleasure!
B00001U03Q|5.0|I keep reading negative reviews from fans or former fans who want  an artist to remain as they remember them in a certain time and place in their lives.  Well, there's this concept called evolution; and guess what, artists like the rest of us change and move on.  Yes, they evolve.  Personally, I like ALL of Clapton's work.  Whether it's his early stuff or his recent \\"balladeer\\" (some previous reviewer wrote that word) type music, I can still appreciate his superb and masterful guitar skills.  He still writes superb music and the fact that he can still get an album recorded and sold after four decades in the business speaks volumes.  If you don't appreciate evolution, just stay in the past or move on to another artist who plays the same stuff over and over again.
B000B5IPLK|4.0|Love this girl. Soulful, spiritually grounded, and all the way  live.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars, but 4 is just right. <br /> <br />Love Every Little Bit Hurts...If I Ain't Got You is sung with so much passion. A Woman's Worth better than original version. <br /> <br />I hope she gets back on the road so I can experience the magnificent wonder and genius in her. She might not have \\"8 octaves\\" but she is certainly here for the long haul and knows how to use what she's got. <br /> <br />Do the dayum thing Alicia!!!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Before I get into the review, I would like to explain exactly what is going on with this CD because a lot of people do not seem to fully understand. This CD is System of a Down's third CD, not their fourth. In addition to that, it has been almost five years since their last CD, so this is a long awaited release from them. Another interesting fact about \\"Mezmerize\\" is that it is actually part two of a two disk set, and not part one as some people had previously thought. Their fourth CD \\"Hypnotize,\\" will be released on November 22nd and is actually the first part of the two disk set. The band just decided to release the two in opposite orders. To further explain my point, \\"Hypnotize\\" leads into \\"Mezmerize.\\" The last song on \\"Hypnotize\\" has the same title as the first track on \\"Mezmerize,\\" although the one on \\"Hypnotize\\" is a full-length song, and the one on \\"Mezmerize\\" is merely an intro or transition into \\"Mezmerize.\\" Plus, the two cases containing the CDs can be combined to create one continuous case with the artwork linking together, and as far as I know, it is the first CD set to ever incorporate that.    Some people might wonder why they are releasing two CDs only six months apart from each other, and why those two CDs are being released as a two disk set. It is simply because they had around thirty songs written and instead of picking the best songs out of those thirty and throwing away the rest, they decided to cut it down to twenty three of the best songs because they felt that the majority of them were CD worthy. Also, they did not want to have an album that was too long to listen to all the way through and is why they have cut them down to around forty minutes each; which brings me to my review.    First off, I would like to say that this review is split into two parts. I have read too many reviews which contained information that I was not looking for, and I am trying not to do that. So what I'm doing is splitting them up into two comparisons. The first part compares the album to the band's first two albums and the second to other albums in its genre. This way the review will not be geared towards specifically System of a Down fans or heavy metal fans in general, but instead towards both.    Compared to the band's other albums, I would give this album four out of five stars for a few reasons. Their first CD simply entitled \\"System of a Down,\\" was very heavy and raw. It had an unmixed feel to it which built up its raw intensity. Their second CD entitled \\"Toxicity,\\" was more mellow and comical. It did have its heavy moments, but was no where near as heavy as their self-titled debut; which leads me to \\"Mezmerize.\\" First of all, it is an excellent album. It is really a combination of their first two albums, and more. The lyrics, as always, are brilliant and entertaining at the same time. They manage to use humorous or just downright strange things which actually end up being complex metaphors. The only problem is that although the lyrics are better, they are a little more repetitive than their previous releases. Second, it is unique from any of their other albums. It starts off unlike their previous two. Instead of abruptly starting off with a heavy riff right away, as \\"System of a Down\\" and \\"Toxicity\\" did, it starts off with a mellow and melodic intro, which then leads into a heavy second song. The rest of the CD, excluding the last song, manages to keep a very heavy feel while at the same time, incorporating a softer side of System of a Down, and the fast song transitions manage to help keep a fast-paced feel. In addition to that, they throw in some different styles of music such as dance, punk, and even polka. Yes, polka! It sounds odd but it sounds even better with those types of music in it. The strange combination of music that they use with their style of vocals just works, to put it simply. The final track on the CD is mellow, but unlike most bands, is not worse. In fact, it may be one of the better songs on the entire CD. It is a very good ending to a very good two disk album (with \\"Hypnotize\\" included). Any System of a Down fan should love this album. Their intensity manages to stay as high as ever, but at the same time incorporates a softer and more experimental side.    Now compared to other bands or CDs in its genre, \\"Mezmerize\\" deserves five out of five stars for the simple fact that it is unlike anything else in its genre. They combine heavy metal, polka, dance music, melodic harmonies, and humorous lyrics while all together keeping a deep and serious meaning and hard-hitting riffs. How many bands have done that? This CD, I think, will change the metal genre as we know it. A lot of bands will be following in their footsteps. Now for this CD, don't expect a non-stop scream fest with heavy riffs. Instead, expect something different and unique that still has that heavy metal feel, but is more experimental and has more depth and range. A lot of bands' songs on the radio are good, but the rest of their CD is not. The only good songs are the singles that are on the radio, and the rest just seems thrown together. Well, System of a Down is one band that will not fall into that hole. \\"Mezmerize\\" is just a great CD throughout, and its short running time of about thirty-eight minutes makes it easy to listen to and enjoy all the way through; but don't take my word for it, just look at the billboard charts. It was number one and had the number one single for weeks, and sold over 800,000 copies in its first week alone. That's more than most heavy metal bands can brag about.    So, whether one is a long-devoted System of a Down fan, or a heavy metal fan in general, this CD would be a part of their collection.
B0000508UN|4.0|If you like Grant Green's funky period, and you want to hear a live set, you can't go wrong with this one.  I think it is much better than \\"Live at the Lighthouse.\\"  This one's a keeper.
B000AL730O|1.0|I'm sure once I figure out how to get the songs on my ipod I'll start enjoying the music, but at this point, I feel like trashing the CD!<br /><br />I can't believe that EMI would choose a content protection format that is not fully compatible with ipods.  I didn't even notice the teeny print on the CD cover saying that it may not be compatible with ipods until after I was unable to load the songs into itunes.<br /><br />What recourse do I have?  I doubt that I can return the CD.  In the future, I'll be very careful when purchasing CDs and will only buy them if they are either returnable or compatible with how I want to listen to the music.<br /><br />Funny how in the paper today there is an article about the sad state of the music business: ie, not enough CDs are being sold.  As a person who currently does buy CDs, an experience such as this is only going to make me reconsider where I spend my money.
0307276902|5.0|This book should be read by everyone.  We all suffer from some sort of addiction and this book makes you look inside yourself in a very raw and honest way.  Although I am not a substance abuse user it gave me a new perspective on drug and alcohol abuse.   <br />This book is brutally honest and vivid.  James Frey puts you in the recovery process with him.  At times I felt physical pain, at times I felt anger, at times I felt sadness, at times I thought I don't know if I could have been as brave as he was and is to this day.   <br />This is a must read book for anyone who knows someone with an addiction or who is an addict or a recovering addict themselves.   <br />The words are powerful, moving and in some ways almost unimaginable.  I think all of us will come away a little better for having read this amazing story. <br />
B000AMPZGC|5.0|Well it's Danny Elfman so obviously I could never give him anything less than a five. Like most music he has composed for Tim Burton films, the Corpse Bride soundtrack has a wintery, eerie, and haunting sound; creepy angelic choir and everything. My only complaint is I wish there were more songs with actual lyrics in them, like \\"According To Plan\\", \\"Tears To Shed\\", \\"The Wedding Song\\"  and \\"Remains Of The Day.\\" The purely intrumental songs are great too but those are my favorites. \\"According To Plan\\" is exceptionally catchy. I wouldn't recommend listening to it at all unless you can deal with it getting stuck in your head for about three days afterwards.
0060920084|1.0|To quote Bryson himself (page 95): \\"It's not often that you see an idea that stupid brought to fruition.\\" <br /> <br />First page is simular to the last page, as is everything in between. Bryson has as many thoughts in a whole book as a decent writer has on one page.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|The first five songs are excellent but the quality drops off after that.  It's a shame because I feel Precious is one of the best singles they've ever recorded.  That's saying a lot for a band this talented and successful.
0385507755|5.0|This book pulls you in from the first moment you begin. Mr. Frey's descriptive writing allows the reader to feel along with the characters. The style of writing makes you feel as though you are an actual observer on the scene. Nothing has moved me so deeply or touched me so strongly in a long time. I have a whole new understanding of the life of an addict. I have found the ability to empathize and finally have a small level of understanding. Although one of the most successful programs there are, the AA Program's success rate is weak at best. I feel that Mr. Frey has allowed another option, something else that may work for those that AA has failed. This is a must read for EVERYONE!
B00003CXPD|5.0|I purchased the DVD \\"Billy Elliot\\" as a birthday gift for a friend.  She watched my copy and wanted her own.  It was not available anywhere in my city.  I am a great-grandmother who \\"is being dragged, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century\\" by my children.  Yours was my first experience purchasing anything online. Ordering from your site was easy, the product arrived before promised, and was in excellent condition.  Thank you for making this bold venture such a rewarding experience.
0307276902|5.0|It is a great book. I have a hard time putting it down. It is a very real to life book.
0061020680|5.0|I just finished reading this book and The Wee Free Men, another brilliant Pratchett novel from his young adult series, and I am thoroughly convinced: Terry Pratchett is a genius writer.  I have no idea how he manages to do such an amazing job developing his characters, settings, and stories, but every single Pratchett book that I've read is unfailingly strong from all angles. Not to mention that he inserts elements that make you think, long past the point where you've turned the last page. <br /> <br />Mort was no different -- a thoroughly engaging tale of adolescent love and an interesting internship.  Within the first few pages I could SEE Mort in my mind, so good was Pratchett's description.  Mort's journey as he goes from an awkward teenager to a more polished but still unsure version of himself as Death's apprentice is truly funny and laced with elements of real seriousness, just like life. <br /> <br />More than once I've found myself laughing out loud at Pratchett's writing, and I've decided that I can't start any of his books on any evening before I have to get up early, because I have yet to be able to put one down before it ends.   The way he can make a spare, simple sentence speak volumes constantly amazes me, and even in his most fantastic characters, you'll recognize little bits of people you know. <br /> <br />Brilliant.
1400031087|5.0|By conventional standards, this is not a well-written book. It shamelessly rejects syntactic, grammatical and punctuational proprieties. Even the paragraphs aren't right-justified. The point, however, was not to write a novel; the point was to tell a story, to communicate an experience. Like the book's name, the writing is fragmented and irregular, and so is the story, and so is the person telling it. It's told without pretense, like a rough draft, like an extemporaneous narration. No time is wasted and nothing is held back. The accounts and characters are vivid and piquant. The story is so compelling at times, that it penetrates right through to the gut. Yet it is told masterfully. <br />There were a few things I especially liked about the story itself. I liked how James stuck with his theology to the end. The story imparted a feeling of hope and courage and determination and triumph. I enjoyed feeling close to the characters. Probably most of all I am grateful for the opportunity to experience such a distant reality from my own, and through it to appreciate what I have.
1594200696|1.0|Look folks, read the publisher's blurb about this book.  Especially pay attention to the part where it quotes Whatshername describing herself, or her work, or some such thing.  Apparently she hasn't even learned that sentences are supposed to contain verbs.<br /><br />Seriously, this books is a travesty.  The publishers have taken one of the greatest books on writing in English and have trivialized it by adding illustrations that profit little and editorial changes that destroy the book's original integrity.  Please buy the original instead of this edition.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Thank you, Rod. As a very late age/stage college student who usually needs absolute silence to study, the music helps me along. <br /> <br />
B000B2YQX4|5.0|This is definitely a fan pleaser. I must say that I love all of their songs.  Martin and Dave are lyrical geniuses.  Cannot leave home without it and I find myself humming the songs all day long.
B0001I55SS|4.0|This film is so close to being a truly great, great sci-fi epic.  But the flaws are so painfully fatal...I have been fond of this film since I was a child and in later years realized just how close they came to greatness.  What's great: it is the most visually stunning sci-fi film ever made (the wayward Cygnus ship, while completely impractical for its supposed purpose, is a masterpiece of sci-fi gothic weirdness), inspired casting and performances (notably from Maximilian Schell as the mad Dr. Reinhardt, Anthony Perkins as impressionable science officer Alex, cowardly reporter Ernest Borgnine, and stalwart commander Robert Forrester), a fantastic premise, majestic musical score in parts (but not so great in other parts), a wildly trippy but nonsensical ending worthy of \\"Clockwork Orange\\" mixed with \\"Fantasia\\", and one of the most genuinely frightening villains ever in the mechanized Frankenstein monster created by Reinhardt named Maximilian.  With such a great premise and dark atmosphere, it is shocking at how cheesy and just plain bad the dialogue is.  Perhaps it is the fact that it was a Disney film, they couldn't fully commit to the dark masterpiece they almost had on their hands.  The cheesy robots Vincent and `Old Bob' are hard to take (clearly created to attract the kids, Disney tried to create another R2D2 and C3PO).  Some of the supporting cast falls off precipitously from the quality of the big names.  The action sequences could have been done a lot better as well.  A fascinating case study of an almost great film, but I love it anyway.  Of all of the remakes out there, this is the one that I think is most ripe for another look and to be done right.
B00008WG3U|3.0|I thought it was gonna be pretty cool when I heard the first song, but then it just got too poppy. It has some pretty good songs but, it just sounds bad, and I don't like some of their views like in \\"The Idiots Are Taking Over\\". The biggest reason is that they have way better albums like Punk In Drublic, WT2H&B, Ribbed, and Pump Up The Valuum. If you want a good NOFX album i'd get one of the ones I mentioned, not this one.
B000AARKOO|4.0|The greatest strength of Kingdom of Heaven is also it's greatest liability. Ridley Scott's expensive attempt at recreating one of the many great battles by the West over control of the Holy Land is magnificent in scope, stunning in it's presentation, and strong in it's telling. It's greatest problem, though, is that it tackles too much and thus is unable to fully flesh out the issues that are presented and then bring these issues to resolution.    As a result, the disjointed complexity which seems prevalent throughout the movie becomes it's distinguishing feature. There is not one overall message, but many which all require resolution in 2 and a half hours. These include:    1. a man's journey of redemption and salvation (never really resolved)  2. examining the nature of Jerusalem and it's inhabitants as a Holy City of 3 distinct religions: Judaism, Islam and Christianity.   3. exemplifying the harsh nature of life in the desert  4. profiling the diverse nature of the Crusaders and the task of the King to maintain this organized chaos.  5. Humanizing both armies and the leaders (Balian, Saladin)    On top of this, many of the characters are historical recreations with political events which are drawn from actual events which occurred in politically charged Jerusalem of the 12th century.    That being said there are many characteristics of this movie which are good.     The cinematography is simply excellent. When a person conjures a picture of the crusades in their heads the picture which Kingdom of Heaven portrays is perhaps as close as you're going to get to that mental image. Knights in armor baking and dying outright from exhaustion as they march to the approaching Muslim army, the salty Sicilean port of Messina, and finally, over all, the dusty walled city of Jersalem with it's eclectic, diverse population, it's massive fortifications and walls, and it's focus as spiritual home for so many people.     The acting is fanastic in some regards and falls short in others. Liam Neeson is portrayed in his typical mentor/father figure and excels at it despite having relatively short screen time. Eva Green's character seems to represent more than she is able to portray and, as a result, her character falls short. Edward Norton as the Leper King does a simply magnificent job despite being completely covered. Finally, there is the main character in Orlando Bloom. His overt stoicism and melacholy throughout the film just doesn't seem to carry over well. Perhaps it's because we have typecast him into more jovial/lighthearted roles or maybe it's because he simply does a better job when there's atleast a little fun involved (Pirates and Lord of the Rings comes to mind), but he just doesn't seem to come across as well as he has in his previous movies.     Overall, I give this movie 4 stars because it really is a monumental effort by Ridley Scott. I saw and understood what he was trying to do with this film, but trying to make a film on a topic as massive and culturally charged as the Crusades which requires historians many books to thread the true tale was simply too much even for this well respected director. It is a great topic, but as a movie it takes on more than it needs to chew.

B000ANVQ0K|1.0|So, they finally come up with a Expanded version of a great movie.  Pretty exciting stuff, but wait, there is a 4 disc version as well?  Why not release that in the U.S.?  Because we are suckers, that's why.  We all bought the first version when it came out on DVD, we will all buy it AGAIN in this expanded version, and then we can buy it a THIRD time when they add the \\"International Edition\\" in time for next year's Holiday Season.  Why sell something once when you can re-package and sell it again and again?  George Lucas proved this theory with all the different version of \\"Star Wars\\".
B0006A9FKA|5.0|The BEST movie I have seen yet. It is funny,scary,and it has drama and everything you would want in a movie... I can say Shaun reminds me of myself, one bad day after another..I love this film and I judge every movie( not just zombie movies) by comparring them to this movie...#1 by far
B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman is one of the greatest superheros of all time and yet over the years we have insulted him with crappy movies. Tim Burton's Batman movies were good but they didn't match. Gotham City and the overall look of the film from movie 1 to 2 is inconsistent. Joel Schumacher's  two Batman films were disgraceful . . . he tried to make it campy like the old TV show . . . we are just too intelligent for that . . . whoever got the bright idea to make Alicia Silverstone Batgirl was obviously Clueless (not to mention almost destroyed the series for good.) Let's move on and put all that behind us. Batman Begins is not only a rebirth for the Batman franchise but it is also one of the best superhero flicks to date. If you haven't seen this movie yet . . . you need to. Christian Bale is a great Bruce Wayne and a great Batman . . . unlike some of his predecessor who could only pull off one or the other. The new twist on the Batman myth is so well conceived. Great story, great cast, great acting, awesome special effects . . . I was totally satisfied.  I heard this is to be a trilogy like Spiderman . . . I hope the other two films will hold up to the standard of the first
B00011V8CW|5.0|I have issues with some of the reviews for this album, as I find them unqualified and misleading in reference to the work of David Bowie, when they criticize.  I particularly wonder at the fans who didn't understand the DVD edits.  Yea!  Sound+Vision.<br /><br />First, I am a fan since Hunky Dory (1971 when I was 17 years old).  And still, Hunky Dory is my favorite Bowie Album, because no matter what shape he assumes, this Bowie is always there in vocal styling and spirit.  Other manifestations of the chameleon seem fragmentary by comparison.  The simple melodies and strong lyrics (with the soul of an English bard) summarize all that I feel is best about Bowie.  Hunky Dory may be considered primitive to some, but it is simply masterful to me.<br /><br />Now about soul:  Is this a color?  or heart?  or feeling?  This man's soul is as real as Eminem's, Kenneth Edmund's, Sinatra's, Puccini's, or Mary J. Blige's, etc., etc.  None of these artistes are fakes, manufactured by a studio or management team.<br /><br />However, I believe David feels Black Tie/White Noise is his best work.  He says it was inspired by the 90s L.A. riots.  And that Caucasians deal with \\"people of color\\" by expecting them to \\"become\\" more white, or just completely ignoring them.  I live in L.A., and I agree with this assessment.  This city is very insular.  In contrast, Tampa, Florida (my hometown) is predominately Republican, but has stronger, truer racial integration.  Go figure.  David is trying to give back to black music, which he credits as his greatest inspiration.  Some \\"fans\\" who don't know that David's soul is not plastic but, rather, flesh and blood, probably have never accepted and can never accept his wife Iman, or their marriage.  She is definitely his black tie and proof of his soul.  He was wed to Angela for 12 or so months.  Wed to Iman \\"forever.\\"<br /><br />The DVD is edited in a way meant to seduce the viewer into the action, by means of rhythm, color, graceful elegance, and camera technique-----Performance Art. It may seem like a maelstrom, but give it time, and you'll go with the flow, and like it, or end with a migraine.  This is considered the MTV style of video editing, (meant to emulate/stimulate the minds of precocious 13 year olds), and it works for me.  Do you remember when you were thirteen (barring oppressed households).  How the world seemed like your oyster?  And you had imagination?  Black Tie/White Noise videos have this quality.  He is as good as or even better than Mick Jagger in being forever young.  Watching this DVD makes me feel extraordinarily young.<br /><br />I find the package to be a work of art itself.  It is a paper box that folds out and houses 2 jewel boxes. If you keep all your CDs in precisely measured slots, this box set will not fit.  It is the same height and length of a regular jewel box, but the depth is about 2.5 times larger.  Height, length, and width as follows: (126 mm x 143 mm x 25 mm) or  (5\\" x 5.625\\" x 1\\").  I have a CD tower whose slots each house 13 standard jewel boxes standing upright, as if on a bookshelf.  With this on the shelf, only 12 disks will fit in a slot.  This set is roughly the size of 2.5 boxes combined, not a big deal.  The set folds out in the center like a book, into 2-panels, with the original CD and liner notes (printed info on package) on the left, and the Bonus CD/DVD and liner notes on the right.  Then, it opens yet again on both sides to reveal a 4-panel spread that looks like a banner advertisement of the words \\"David Bowie: Black Tie White Noise,\\" in white/orange/black coloring.  While closed and held right-side up, both disks can be slid out the right side of the package, as if it were a regular sleeve housing a standard jewel box.  Hey, you can always just take the 2 regular-sized jewel boxes out of the paper box.  In my opinion, the total package is as idiosyncratic as the action in the DVD, and both are well designed.  Truly, a collector's item.<br /><br />To fans, Bowie is known equally a visual artist as a musician.  I was almost expecting not to like this DVD/album set based on some fan's reviews. He is an artiste no matter what.  Moreover, the DVD interviews cut from one to another rapidly so as to convey the mood of the album or the man himself, in a minimum of words.  Did you ever think that maybe this is how he lives?  Jet set, creative, international traveler; he is all this.  His and Mick Jagger's lives have the vitality of teenaged boys.<br /><br />It's like Beyonce asking in \\"Lose My Breath\\" from Destiny Fulfilled, \\"Can you keep up?\\"<br /><br />I'm so sure this man is extraordinary, and no regular guy is ever going to figure him out.  Maybe, we can study him, if our pride does not prevent this.  I did not need for him to explain every detail to me.  Thus, the style of  taking sentences from several different topics and splicing them together as a whole, will force you into using all your senses to understand.  Many will feel that he never quite \\"tells his story completely or clearly,\\" and they never fully come to understand the man, his repertory, or what he is trying to say/show.<br /><br />I say this, then, just look, listen, and look again, if need be.  Let your feelings do the explaining.  And if you still need for Bowie to tell you what he had for breakfast on March 3, 1999 (an arbitrary date), then the chameleon successfully escaped you, according to plan.  The nature of a chameleon is to escape danger.<br /><br />By accepting Bowie's art (practically unconditionally) without wanting to change anything, you might become a real Bowie fan, who can rock, swing, bump, and grind right along with him and never miss a beat.<br /><br />Fan, I say.  Not patron.  I'm forever a Bowie FAN-AT-IC.  This Limited Edition album is like a \\"rush of blood\\" to my head, and it renews my spirit for avant-garde music.musician.  I was almost expecting not to like this DVD/album set based on some fan's reviews. He is an artiste no matter what.  Moreover, the DVD interviews cut from one to another rapidly so as to convey the mood of the album or the man himself, in a minimum of words.  Did you ever think that maybe this is how he lives?  Jet set, creative, international traveler; he is all this.  His and Mick Jagger's lives have the vitality of teenaged boys.    It's like Beyonce asking in \\"Lose My Breath\\" from Destiny Fulfilled, \\"Can you keep up?\\"    I'm so sure this man is extraordinary, and no regular guy is ever going to figure him out.  Maybe, we can study him, if our pride does not prevent this.  I did not need for him to explain every detail to me.  Thus, the style of  taking sentences from several different topics and splicing them together as a whole, will force you into using all your senses to understand.  Many will feel that he never quite \\"tells his story completely or clearly,\\" and they never fully come to understand the man, his repertory, or what he is trying to say/show.    I say this, then, just look, listen, and look again, if need be.  Let your feelings do the explaining.  And if you still need for Bowie to tell you what he had for breakfast on March 3, 1999 (an arbitrary date), then the chameleon successfully escaped you, according to plan.  The nature of a chameleon is to escape danger.    By accepting Bowie's art (practically unconditionally) without wanting to change anything, you might become a real Bowie fan, who can rock, swing, bump, and grind right along with him and never miss a beat.    Fan, I say.  Not patron.  I'm forever a Bowie FAN-AT-IC.  This Limited Edition album is like a \\"rush of blood\\" to my head, and it renews my spirit for avant-garde music.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Obviously the original is a classic . . . but this one is more accurate to the book . . . and I love the book. I think it is a matter of preference . . . I know some people who saw this movie and totally hated it and others like me found it better then the original. Those who like Tim Burton movies and/or Johnny Depp are going to really enjoy this. I think the two movies are so extremely different that you can be a fan of both versions.
B00005N9CV|5.0|They may be old-style songs, but they are so gracefully done.  Picture yourself in a high class nightclub on a rainy September night in Atlanta.  The mood that is created is intimate and inviting.    What a musician.  Her rendition of \\"Look of Love\\" is outstanding.  Hard to believe she is not more well known. I plan to search out more of Diana's music.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A friend told me about this and I borrowed hers and then just had to get my own to watch them all again.
B00005JGAB|3.0|People with brain damage would love this music.  Only three chords, yah hoo.   I guess some people like to have 16 beers and slam dance to this stuff.   Ha
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|A GREAT MOVIE ALTHOUGH I HATE CHANGING DISCS HALFWAY THROUGH.I WISH THE MOVIE WAS DOUBLE SIDED BUT THE QUALITY IS WELL WORTH IT THE OTHER REVIEWERS SAID IT ALL JUST BUY THIS DISC.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I am a casual fan of Coldplay but I do own both their albums 'Parachutes' and 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head' on CD, but after hearing many of the songs on X&Y elsewhere I don't think I will be purchasing it. Why? <br /> <br />I agree with another reviewer who said that Coldplay's lyrics seem to be subpar than the ones on their earlier albums. Also there don't seem to be any real memorable melodies except for 'Fix You' and just (and I really do mean JUST) 'Speed Of Sound'. <br /> <br />If you are thinking of buying this album I'd wait until you can get it much cheaper on ebay.
B000AP04MO|5.0|THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE I GOT THIS MOVIE OVER ONE AGO ON DVD I JUST COULD NOT WAIT FOR SLOW US RELEASE,HOWEVER I HAVE ORDERED CURRENT US VERSION.IF THEY CHANGE THE RELEASE DATE I WILL STILL HAVE A COPY OF THIS GEM
B00005JM02|5.0|Ok I'm 19 years old and I've seen a lot of Disney movies growing up. I'm a huge fan of their work, since they have interesting stories and a wide variety of characters and plots. However, Finding Nemo stands out above all of them, for me personally. Visually, it's breath-taking. I was in awe as soon as the movie started, just watching the lighting and subtle movement of the ocean's current was AMAZING. The story is anything but mundane. It's very unique and it is absolutely the perfect movie for parent and child. It's about growing up and for the parent to be able to let the kid grow up and not be so sheltered. Also lots of laugh and great musical score. Great movie all around.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is such a great cd, with a wonderful retro feel that is still really hip. My boyfriend and I took a ballroom dancing class and this is really the perfect cd to practice to. \\"Home\\" is sort of a sentimental favorite of ours. Very romantic, very sweet, lots of fun - highly recommend it!
B000AL730O|1.0|Well... I had to edit my review of this album upon further listening. Initially I said it was rubbish but I was wrong. Most of the songs on this album are pretty strong. I especially like \\"Friends to Go\\" and the majority of the other songs.  One thing Mac has always had is a feel for is melodies and a good voice which at the age of 63 has not deminished too much.  The piano work in many of the songs is good and his own back up vocals also work well as does the mixture of different instruments. There's the familiar Beatle's guitar licks in the background which Harrison used on many Fab 4 songs. Overall it's an enjoyable album and the style remains faithfull to Paul's Beatles days and following solo works.  The one thing Paul is also consitent with, unfortunately, is the lameness of most of his lyrics.  That's the one point where Lennon probably helped him because on his own, McCartney's lyrics leave a bit to be desired. Overall I give this album a 3 1/2 stars.  I recommend it to anyone thinking about buying it with one recommendation : give it a bit of time before judging it.
B00005OWEG|5.0|I'll be honest.  I'm not much on Vietnam War films, but Apocalypse Now was a great one, and Redux was even better.  The sound and the picture is excellent.  I was surprised, the first time I saw it, about how many people were in it.  Marlon Brando WAS Col. Kurtz, but Robert DuVall steals the show as Bill Kilgore.  The fact that the movie took over two years to make is unbelievable, but what came out was also unbelievable.   <br /> <br />If I have any objections, there are two.  One:  Why can't the movie be in a wider aspect ratio?  It says on the Amazon DVD info that it's 2.35:1, but its actually 1.85:1.  And two: When will \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" and the underground \\"Rough Cut\\" of Apocalypse Now be available?  The \\"rough cut\\" is almost six hours long, but it wouldn't be bad to view it at least once.  I guess we'll just have to wait.  But until then, Redux will still be better than the original.
B000AGTPUA|4.0|I too saw the movie in 3-D.  It surpassed my expectations of an animated movie.  The special effects of 3-D added another dimension to animation: you feel the snowflakes falling, and I remember the reflection/image of viewing the character from below ice. Everyone falls in love with the Polar Express train as its engine appears bigger than life. <br />I would also give the 3-D version 5 stars.  Is it available?
B00005JO0J|5.0|If you thought you might have liked Firefly, or actually have been able to see it, probably on DVD as the network killed it, then this movie is a must.  It stays true to the show and the twists and turns you go on are amazing.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Neil Fallon & Co still rules when it comes to pure and solid rock n roll. With the heavy blues-rock-sound and Fallons thick and rough voice it doesnt get any better than this folks. The \\"Robot Hives\\" record has that little extra, that \\"Blast Tyrant\\" missed actually. Like the early \\"Pure Rock Fury\\", \\"Elephant Riders\\" and \\"Jam Room\\" - Clutch have done it again. They have a tendency to just rock your socks off.  <br />Beautiuful and heavy guitar jams with solid drum beats and skilful thick vocals, makes it a fast and good rhythm in a pure and true rock n roll spirit that only CLUTCH can achieve. <br /> <br />Buy it, belive me!! <br /> <br />/Crook
B00000K3D4|5.0|I loved this as a kid, and still do as an adult.  I can not wait until my daughter is old enough to watch it too.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I had never seen Firefly, and bought the DVDs based on the advice of the podcast EscapePod. I was not dissapointed; they were great. As so often happens, something too good for television came along, and got cancelled. If you haven't seen Firefly, it's a space western with a wry sense of humor. As with Whedon's Buffy series, the plot and characters are totally unbelievable, but that doesn't get in its way from being very entertaining. Theater, after all, requires the willing suspension of disbelief...
B00007GZR5|1.0|Visually the movie had its moments, but other than that this movie was pretty lame.  After the first half hour I was knocked out cold.  Skip this one.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I have already seen this movie about four times on DVD in the past week because it is amazingly good.  Not since Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando in SUPERMAN have I seen a superhero movie that captures the mythic subtext inherent in every great hero in a way that would make Joseph Campbell laugh like a child at play.  As such, for me, this even beats Spider Man by a country mile.<br /><br />Christian Bale has seemed to me well poised for becoming our Brando ever since he gave me the creeps in SHAFT--not to mention AMERICAN PSYCHO.  He does not disappoint by any stretch of the imagination here, giving Batman the dark yet human quality he so desperately needs; something missing since the Tim Burton/Michael Keaton/Jack Nicholson venture (that should have earned Jack another one of his Oscars as far as I'm concerned).<br /><br />The movie is chock full of the best character actors in the business:  Michael Caine as a brilliant Alfred, the loyal butler; Morgan Freeman as a scientist/inventor that is more like the techno master in the 1960s series MISSION IMPOSSIBLE than Q in JAMES BOND (though the comparisons to Q will be unavoidable); Gary Oldman as the young sargeant turned lieutenant (soon enough to become Comissioner) Gordon; Rutger Hauer, iconic bad guy and spy from the seventies and eighties as Mr. Earle, the well-intentioned but questionable agenda-ed CEO of Wayne Enterprises; and Liam Neeson playing a role he has come to master: mentor; to Bruce Wayne, who, in leaving Western Civilization and all of his wealth in order to find his soul after the murder of his parents before his eyes, becomes a lost soul that is saved by this Jedi-like follower of a mysterious guru in the Eastern mountains.<br /><br />And yet none of them outpace the magic and beauty of Christopher Nolan's direction--who also helped write the screenplay.  There is maybe about two minutes of the two hours of his work that I would change in the total picture; something I can only say from having been so riveted to it I watched it four times in a week (as I said) to notice areas where there could even be improvement.<br /><br />The musical score by Hans Zimmer is also nothing short of breathtaking--when you even register that it exists--further intensifying the character development, action, plot and dialogue: the sign of a master movie composer at the top of his game.<br /><br />This movie needs to be a part of the collection of anyone who loves movies, regardless of age or interest. My teenage son bought it for the house, saying, as I missed seeing this on  the big screen, that I need to see it.  He was right.nly say from having been so riveted to it I watched it four times in a week (as I said) to notice areas where there could even be improvement.   <br /> <br />The musical score by Hans Zimmer is also nothing short of breathtaking--when you even register that it exists--further intensifying the character development, action, plot and dialogue: the sign of a master movie composer at the top of his game. <br /> <br />This movie needs to be a part of the collection of anyone who loves movies, regardless of age or interest.

6305972591|3.0|The strange thing about this whole movie and its trail of sequels that I have never had the inkling to watch is that it was just a itty bitty short story in Stephen King's Night Shift. (Look for the book on the dashboard of the car in front of Linda Hamilton in the opening scenes....) Not totally unfaithful to the story, it still misses around the corners most of the time.  I saw this movie originally when I was like 13 years old and it was scary back then.  Now...well, we're all grown up...so the horrors have become tarnished with age.  But...it still gives a faint tremmor of the willies and that's pretty cool. Not a bad movie for the price...you could do a lot worse with such bile as 976-EVIL for instance.  Overall...decent.  Good watch when the lights go out.<br /><br />Dig it!
B0000020C4|5.0|TAC is best heard (not reviewed) as my literary skills won't give justice to the spectacle that is Les Miz. Nonetheless as a fastidious listener and theater-goer, this recording, by far is the best among the Les Miz cast recordings, bar none. Admittedly, this being dubbed as \\"The Dream Cast\\" may be highly debatable as every person has a different preference (and biases notwithstanding) with regards to certain actors portraying specific roles. Regardless, being a concert recording, this CD is just pure, unadulterated listening pleasure. For one, you have the original Jean Valjean, Colm Wilkinson, playing the lead with his powerful and high vocal range interspersed with sheer emotion as expressed in \\"Bring Him Home\\" and \\"Who Am I\\". Philip Quast of the Australian production lends his baritone voice as Javert rendering a commanding presence in \\"Stars\\". Michael Ball of \\"Starlight Express\\" fame  performs convincingly as Marius, tugging into the audience's heartstrings in his rendition of \\"Empty Chairs At Empty Tables\\". Judy Kuhn reprises her role as Cosette-- though much is to be desired with her acting-- she hits the right notes with \\"A Heart Full of Love\\" and \\"In My Life\\". Michael Maguire as Enjolras still stirs courage in his performance of \\"Red and Black\\"-- reminiscent of his Broadway performance. Lea Salonga, the original Kim of Miss Saigon, reinvents the role of Eponine with her heartfelt belting out of \\"On My Own\\"-- listeners will, for the first time, ENJOY listening to this song as opposed to the original Broadway cast recording. Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway as the Thenardiers portray their roles with zest and wit that is simply fun as intended in \\"Master of the House\\". Overall, this CD is a masterpiece as is the concert DVD, which is another must-own. Strong performances, beautiful voices and melodious score-- this truly is a marvel to behold-- a nostalgic memory of the now-closed Broadway production.
0151006903|2.0|This review will undoubtedly be unhelpful to most because I just can't put my finger on what it was about this book that I didn't like. <br /> <br />Baudolino comes of age in this novel set in the late 1100s.  Born a peasant, he finds himself taken in by Frederick, the Roman Emperor.  This advancement in his station in life allows him to grow up with relative wealth and travel to Paris for a formal education.  It is in Paris that he meets his lifelong friends and begins a fantastical journey through history.  This is a work of historical fiction that meets fantasy through Baudolino's storytelling. <br /> <br />Ordinarily I enjoy both historical fiction and fantasy, but this book was tedious to get through.  I never really found myself enjoying the story, but rejoiced that each chapter was relatively short and I felt like I was making slow, but steady progress.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure what it was about this book that I didn't like.  Maybe some of the flow was lost in the English translation?  Maybe the main character's ramblings were too hard to follow? <br /> <br />Overall it just was not enjoyable for me.  Possibly dedicated history buffs will enjoy the tale but it is not for the light reader or even the reader that enjoys this genere occasionally.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album is awesome. You can't really classify it except that it is in fact prog. After a few listens it really grows on you. Its now one of my favorite albums. One of my favorite songs is the last song, Cassandra Gemini, which is a whopping 30 minutes long. Just but it.
B0009WFF7M|5.0|This release is a two-sided disc with CD stereo on one side and superb DVD-Audio surround sound on the other. Of course, the real 'meat' on this disc is the surround-sound 5.1 DVD side which is simply stunning! If you have a DVD-Video player hooked-up to surround-sound home-theater system, then you'll get a great sound in Dolby Digital 5.1, or 24bit LPCM stereo. <br /> <br />However, very best sound experience possible will come to your ears if you use a \\"DVD-Audio\\" player with its six-analog outputs going straight to your receiver's \\"Multichannel Analog Inputs\\". (These inputs bypass all the receiver's digital circuitry to keep the high-resolution analog signal intact. By the way, the DVD-Audio surround-sound is presented in 96kHz / 24bit on the disc. <br /> <br />Some readers here may know that there is also a SACD version of this album, but be aware that the SACD has been converted from the DVD-Audio's 24bit studio master. So, in short, this DVD-Audio will give you the very best and truest reproduction of what was crafted originally in the studio. <br />
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I bought 5 Shark sweepers (some replacements, some gifts). I loved them and even saved parts to keep at least one alive. One is still good for 5 minutes at a time. I gave up on them because even the replacement batteries don't last.  <br />  I bought a Swivel Sweeper. The battery is much better, but the sweeper doesn't pick up larger items. It's great for bits and pieces. I do really like it, though. It's not that noisy and light and maneuverable as can be. <br /> OK, maybe the warrantee might be doomed with this, but I've been using both commercially in a restaurant. The Shark was absolutely great for this application. It would pick up glass, french fries, toothpicks, cigarette butts---anything. The swivel sweeper won't (more bending over!) but it's much better at getting in tight spaces under chairs (without having to move them).  <br />  They are  NOT vacuum cleaners. They don't suck dirt out of the carpet. The swivel sweeper is great for quick fixes and so far I haven't had a problem with it at all(4 months).I just wish they (both shark and swivel sweeper) would make a commercial product that would last. I would be willing to pay more. Maybe someone out there could create one that would combine all the good qualities.  <br />  I think anyone with a restaurant should check out swivel sweeper. Even if it isn't NSF!
B000063CPL|4.0|and the material from Brave New World is done well.  Doing the Blaze material was ok, but he could have left that off.  They can also get rid of Janick Gers.  He should have joined Deep Purple instead of Steve Morse, but that's another story.  Dream of Mirrors is the best song on the record.  Bruce's voice isn't too good on Number of the Beast, but he gets by.
0446577383|5.0|It's late. I should be in bed by now, but I couldn't wait to get a review started for this book. It's my first Baldacci, but it won't be my last. I was hooked on page one.<br /><br />The Camel Club is a political thriller that opens in Washington, D.C. (well, not quite. The opening chapter is not in D.C.), where we meet four eccentric, once-upon-a-time effective fellows who make up a group they call The Camel Club. Each has some kind of experience and/or brilliance that makes him essential to the small assembly; and each has been successful at one time or another in his life. Now, they are only reflections of what they once were. There's Oliver Stone (his assumed name), Caleb Shaw, Reuben Rhodes, and Milton Farb, conspiracy theorists all. They meet once a month in the middle of the night to discuss recent conspiracy theories and reflect/update those they've held for years. There are other interesting characters introduced in the early pages, including Secret Service agent Alex Ford who's on the downside of his career, and Kate Adams, a Department of Justice lawyer who works as a bartender at night. Go figure that one out! We are also briefly introduced to U.S. President, James H. Brennan, and to National Intelligence Center Director, Carter Gray, among others.<br /><br />Stone has a tent near the White House where he watches what goes on there. His goal is to find out the \\"truth\\" of things. He believes the American people have been denied that most desirous of tenets. On the evening of the beginning of this story, the Camel Club meets as arranged, but in the course of their meeting they unwittingly see a terrible crime committed on Theodore Roosevelt Island. Now, they must decide what to do about it...and I'm only on page 70! More later.<br /><br />October 29, 2005: It's later. Life sometimes gets in the way of finishing a good book, but it's been worth three nights up too late to do it in this case.<br /><br />The Camel Club members find themselves in the middle of a mess, having witnessed the murder of a Secret Service agent. Another Secret Service agent, Alex Ford, angers his superiors by deciding to investigate the death further than they had planned for this intended puppet. Stone and Ford end up working together to find out what's going on as a myriad of characters come and go, some with nefarious plans up their sleeves (there may even be a traitor in the club). It seems there are traitors everywhere and it's one of those times when one doesn't know who to trust. If you are into political intrigue, conspiracy theories, espionage, terrorism and/or assassination plots and all-around political paranoia, you will love this book. It is also very clearly and very well written. I can only say I hope there are many more Stones and Fords around than Captain Jacks and, well, others.<br /><br />Give yourself plenty of time to read The Camel Club. There are several subplots and lots of interesting facts about many things included in the story. The primary plot is very intense and you won't want to find yourself forgetting pertinent details leading up to the \\"game.\\" It's enough to make the reader want to bolt the door and never leave home.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|erm, \\"Shockmaster\\"......PLEASE tell me that review of yours is some kind of sick JOKE. PLEASE. If anyone doesn't seem do understand Batman, it's you. Read ANY Batman comic book before the 50s and after the 1960s, and you'll clearly see that Batman is NOT about buttcheeks, witty lines, and whatever the hell Shoe-smucker supported. Seriously, the guy's parents were gunned down in front of him as a child, and you expect him to grow up happy-go-lucky about it? I think not. The guy grows up wanting revenge. Of COURSE he's gonna be dark and broody about it. \\"Batman a villain\\", as you put it? Dude, who do you think was fighting the REAL bad guys, the tooth fairy? And your gripes about the presence of Qui-Gon Jinn and the Last Samurai guy? Dude, those are CHARACTERS in seperate films, played repectively by Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe. They're actors. As such, they're paid to act in movies, which is what Batman Begins IS. By your logic, an actor can only play ONE role his/her entire life and leave it at that. Seriously, pal, you need to take a look at the real world some time. Batman Begins is everything I'd been expecting in a Batman film. The Burton films were good, but the sets and costumes were too comic-booky and not believable. Batman Begins brings a whole new real-world feel to the legend, and should mark the beginning of a whole new, much grander franchise. Though I supposed one of your intelligence, Shockmaster, won't be able to grasp that, as you seem to be to fixated on fantasies of Batman in a homosexual relationship with Nick Carter. Get a life.
1594200696|1.0|Why have I been required to buy (let alone read) a poorly-illustrated book for a college class???  What a strange world in which we live.  Fifty years ago the very idea of this book would have been ridiculed; today it is lauded.  I yearn for the past.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|It's hard to describe how Sufjan has embodied Michigan and now Illinois in less than an hour and a half of music. I was first introduced to this album because of the track \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\" I listened to it, and thought it easily as haunting as the cover of \\"Mad World\\" by Gary Jules or \\"Adagio for Strings\\" by Samuel Barber. or perhaps a two-fold combination of them. but then I listened to the album all of the way through, and realized that I was completely unprepared for it. I had seen it in bookstores, and heard it hyped at local record stores, and avoided it as a direct result... but then after listening i realized that i had almost missed the best piece of recording of 2005 yet. It's an album best listened to while riding shotgun on a rainy day, listening through headphones and staring at the blur  of the raindrops on a window, or while hiking through the woods.    Take a chance occurance with an Unidentified Flying Object, and have musical epiphanies.    Listen to the title track, feel the breath of Carl Sandburg when he asks if you're writing from the heart.    Realize that on your best behavior, you are really just like John Wayne Gacy, Jr.    Go with your stepmom (you did everything to hate her I'm sure) to Decatur.    Go to Chicago, sell your clothes to the state, because hey, all things go.    On Casimir Polaski Day, Mourn the loss of your friend.    But be a Man of Steel and melt our hearts.    But most importantly, however you take your Illinoise, enjoy.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|I agree with most of the other reviews.  Stay away from this unless you care to see interviews with the principals. Granted the featurettes are pretty extensive but this release is very disappointing. I mean-1) Why not include the  original version of the film on a separate disc? I for one did not like the \\"comic book\\" cut-to scenes and just wish I could see the movie as it played in the theatre.  An example to me of where the comic-scenes really hurt the film is with the ending credits. In this new version, the Joe Walsh/Eagles \\"In the City\\" plays over a comic page.  The theatrical version shows the characters walking away as though they are moving on to a better life.  In this case, the comic book structure removes the emotion and feeling the original closing credits offered. 2) Is Paramount telling us that with all the people who sat down for interviews, not one of them was willing to do a commentary? The visual nature of this movie makes it perfect for a voice-over.  I know chances are the commentary would have repeated much of what the interviews said, but come on, a commentary option would not have hurt. Paramount probably did want to pay anyone for an extra 90 minutes worth of work.  3) I've been hearing about deleted scenes for years. Where were these?   <br /> <br />Paramount Home video does not care about fans who cherish a \\"cult\\" classic. This is the second \\"special\\" release of theirs I purchased which really shortchanges the fans who embrace every nuance about a movie.  I purchased the 25th anniversary edition of \\"Chinatown.\\"   What did we get? A bunch of short, been-there-done-that interviews, that's it. ABout 10 years ago PBS did a special on detective films and in 5 minutes told me more about \\"Chinatown\\" than all the shallow interviews on the DVD combined.   <br /> <br />All in all, I was excited about \\"The Warriors\\" being given it's just due on DVD and have enjoyed watching the featurettes, some more than once. But I am extremely disappointed with how Paramount decided to once again diss consumers and film lovers just to make a quick buck. Come on Paramount-we show you the money, show your consumers some enthusiasm!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I honestly don't know what else to say other than what I titled this. The acting is amazing, and the story is excellent. Oldboy is probably the best foreign movie I've ever seen as well. The story is woven so expertly throughout and it would've been easy for another director to have finished the movie with loose ends or plot holes. After seeing Oldboy, I was dumbfounded. Utterly dumbfounded. The movie is pretty powerful in certain spots and has scenes you'll be thinking about for weeks. Do yourself a big favor and see this movie knowing as little about it as possible. You'll be in for quite an emotional expierence. A scene near the end of the movie hit me over the head like a sledgehammer. The way that scene is done is phenomenal. Five stars, A-plus, ten out of ten... however you rate movies, it earns this distinction easily.
0525948023|5.0|After reading and listening to many of Tolle's works, I find that this one brings the teachings full circle. The Power of Now was very experiential for me, that is, I was pulled into the now moment by his words without trying. A New Earth is more intellectual and puts the concepts into a brainy form.  <br /> <br />Combined, the above mentioned works are synergistic to create a full circle of understanding which just blows me away. <br /> <br />I would also consider this book to be more rudimentary for the newcomer to Tolle, however it still holds my attention strongly. <br /> <br />A must read!!
0060763280|1.0|I bought this book thinking it would have some tips on how to become financially self sufficient but what I read was a marketing piece for the author's seminars.<br /><br />He had many tips on changing your mindset to a 'millionaire' by touching your head and saying it's so but he failed to include any ways to actually become wealthy.  His only hints were to become self employed and manufacture something that can be sold to many people, like pencils, or to produce something that can generate royalties.  But no where in the book does it say how to become wealthy.
B0000844IT|4.0|THE EVIL DEAD series is one of the more popular horror trilogies (one of the only too, besides SCREAM) that defined low-budget horror and campy shtick with creepy scares and a sense of pure dread. While the first was more of a horror film than the other two that followed, ARMY OF DARKNESS is indeed a very campy horror film in its own right, thanks to its comic and beloved star Bruce Campbell and some funny special effects, including the hilarious skeletons, which while creepy are also amusing. <br /> <br />ARMY OF DARKNESS picks right up where EVIL DEAD 2 left off, with our hero Ash transported through the portal to 14th century medieval times, where some believe a prophecy has been fulfilled with Ash's arrival. But some believe that he's only trouble, and hold him captive. He ultimately proves them all wrong, and indeed gains the upper hand. While being told that the countryside is being plagued by horrors from a curse returning, the only way to stop it is to find the Necronomicon (\\"Book of the Dead\\"). This book can ultimately defeat the evil threatening the castle and village, and it can also send Ash back to his own time (where he's a gun store clerk). The 20th century slang Bruce Campbell uses throughout the movie is absolutely hysterical, and even you can't help but chuckle once you hear it. When the evil king emerges and takes Ash's dream girl hostage, she turns evil. Then it's up to Ash to join the two warring factions and unite them for battle against the undead (namely, all skeletons). It's a funny movie, creepy in places, but ultimately funny more than creepy. I think that's one of the reasons ARMY OF DARKNESS is such a hoot. Bruce Campbell adds so much to the character he has defined, and you are always rooting for Ash (except for when he gets a little mean to the princess, now that's rude...but funny). The ending very much leaves the door open to the possibility of EVIL DEAD 4, but to this day no confirmed plans are in the works, though there is talk about possibly doing a 4th EVIL DEAD film.  <br /> <br />ARMY OF DARKNESS concludes (for now or forever) the campy fun that is the EVIL DEAD series. While leaning more towards dark comedy than the previous two installments and tending to lag in very few spots, ARMY OF DARKNESS is still a (subdued) horror movie, but a comic one at that. Raimi obviously put a lot into these films, and ARMY is no exception. Kick off your shoes, put your feet up, lean back and just enjoy the campy showcase of ARMY OF DARKNESS...(make sure you find the two-disc editions, which are coming out of print fast...you'll find the director's cut on one disc with over 15 minutes of unreleased footage not shown theatrically)
B00006RAKP|5.0|I know what you're thinking.It's missing this song,or it's missing that song.Okay,I agree some of that brown stuff that comes from a backside on disc 2 could have been substituted for something like \\"Empty Garden\\",\\"I Feel A Bullet In The Gun Of Robert Ford\\" or \\"Kiss The Bride\\".But oh well.<br />Disc 1 is stellar.It shows EJ at the peak of his powers in the 70's.<br />Disc 2 is okay,but it's weighed down at the end (the last two songs) by some songs that are not in the same league as something like \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\\".<br /><br />Overall this is still one great package though.Sure there'll always be songs that \\"coulda and shoulda been on here\\" but there was only two discs to work with.It's a wonder they(the record label) put what they did on here.In other parts of the world,it's a 3 disc set not a 2.Why the U.S. didn't get it like that remains a mystery.I guess it wasn't \\"economically feasible\\".
6305841861|5.0|THE EVIL DEAD was a cult hit when it came out on video, thanks to word of mouth and great camera work and special effects. It was also good thanks to the acting kitsch of Bruce Campbell and company, but Campbell made the cut. Now with the idea that another 'Dead' movie would follow, could it match up to the kitsch and scares of the first? You bet! <br /> <br />EVIL DEAD 2: Dead By Dawn is ultimately more a campy, funny, and scarier re-make of the first film (although it is a sequel, it's more a reinvisioning of the first film with better elements). It even approaches a sort of \\"looney tunes\\" type status with some of its scares, especially the moment where Ash's girlfriend spins out in front with her head popping off and then back on (this is after ash decapitated her and buried her out front).  <br /> <br />Back to the woods we go, for another round. Ash comes to the cabin (or cottage, whatever you want to call it) with girlfriend Linda (not the same one from the first) for a relaxing getaway, and ultimately finds an device and plays the tape in it and incantations once again summon our evil spirit fiends from the woods. The real beginning of the film is terrific, with the \\"force\\" plowing through the woods, the cabin, through the front door and, ultimately, to our hero, possessing him until the rise of the sun. A new group of people decide to visit the cabin themselves, and then the mayhem ultimately proceeds to ensue, with one of the funniest being mother locked in the basement (remember the creepy moments in the basement in the first movie? those are nothing compared to the moments in this one), trying to trick her daughter into letting her out. The best moments of the film come when Ash's hand decides to take on a mind of its own after his hand gets bit by one of the possessed newcomers, and Ash hacks it off and links his hand-less arm to a chainsaw (could that be an homage to Texas Chainsaw? Nah!). This movie has more laughs than the first one does, but it stilldoes have its very creepy moments, with the frenzied camera angles returning; the possessed woods capturing a woman and, near the end, ultimately coming to life to batter the cabin while Ash and one person struggle against the forces in the woods; the big giant scary, but really quite amusing, face that appears in the doorway before being sucked into the portal, which ultimately sucks our hero into another time, leading into the camp ARMY OF DARKNESS, which is by all means a true completion to this ever scary but truly fun trilogy. It, like its predecessor, has a great ending...you will truly appreciate the work Raimi put into this film, with Bruce Campbell (now one of my favorite actors) back in top form with his manic and frenzied performance.  <br /> <br />DEAD BY DAWN is the ultimate follow-up to a cult favorite, and the third and final installment of the series would very much end the series on a campy note. Would this be the last we hear from our buddies Campbell and Raimi? Definitely not. Was ARMY OF DARKNESS the last EVIL DEAD? Only time will tell. Is EVIL DEAD 2 worth your watch? Absolutely.
B00004LN16|5.0|This is a AC/DC album, they all sound alike meaning they all are just as good as the next. Some people dont know what they are talking about. NO album created by AC/DC is just \\"filler\\". People dont know how to respect and stay loyal to band. If your a AC/DC fan your gonna love this album just as much as all the others. AC/DC has sold the fifth most records with over 70 million, trust me its not \\"filler\\" there doing something right. and for everyone bashing, I have no idea whats wrong with you.
B00005R24K|4.0|I remember the first time I saw previews for this movie when I was little and never taking the chance to see it. I never even rented it and I wanted to, but I was worried about it being just one of those \\"by-the-numbers, just-like-every-other-horror-movie\\" type of film. I went ahead and purchased the DVD, hoping that it would unlock some type of reaction - some kind of glimmer of hope. What's the verdict on this low-budget shocker? <br /> <br />First off, let me be one of the first to say that the camera angles in this movie really make it quite terrifying. Raimi's camera work is pure genius...he uses the camera angles and frenzied shots to his advantage, and they add more to the film, making it ultimately more creepy. EVIL DEAD is a real treat of a low-budget film, and the atmosphere will give you the chills for nights after you watch this. One of the many reasons this film is great is actor Bruce Campbell, who plays Ash, the hero of the film. His comic turns; his sense of dread; his fear; his anger; every thing he is feeling, you're feeling ultimately more. The other actors in this movie, Betsy Baker, Ellen Sandweiss, Sarah York...all of them lend this movie a realistic sense of dread that can only permeate from a great horror film. Mind you, this isn't just a horror movie...elements of comedy and action also flow into this, but make no mistake, this is still very much a shocker. After five people set out to the woods of a remote part of Tennessee, they find not quiet but chaos after awakening evil spirits in the backwoods with the incantation played from a tape reading scriptures from the ancient \\"book of the dead\\". People start getting possessed one by one (all except for Ash); one of the ladies has a rather lewd encounter with possessed trees; a mysterious and angry force is after our hero in the final frame of the film (which is by far one of the best I've ever seen); and Linda (Ash's girlfriend) goes nuts and eventually, is decapitated by Ash, who really hadno choice in the matter. All the scenes at nighttime are chilling, no doubt this would be quite scary if it really were happening. Just be grateful that this is only a movie. The ending of the film is one of the strongest, and the sequel would perfectly pick right up where this low-budget chiller would leave us...hungry for more. <br /> <br />So if you're looking for a good scare this Halloween, you should look no further than THE EVIL DEAD. Though there are plenty of good fright flicks out there to enjoy, EVIL DEAD is a whole new experience, low-budget done right and done scary. You will never think of the woods the same way again after watching this...anyone rent a cabin?
B0009UC7H0|2.0|The sidekick whats-his-name is pretty funny, but the movie just sucks. If you have to even ask about the story, it's the same movie with a different name. I'm sure they're praying daily to the scientology God for a franchise, but I really hope it just dies.<br /><br />It's basically a chick-flick as well, because it's all about Matthew. He just adores himself.<br /><br />But hey, sometimes we want a stupid action movie to kill 90 minutes so it's got it's place.<br /><br />Wholly un-memorable.
B00006EXL5|5.0|I bought this album after I bought \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\". Yes, I admit it. Despite its all too distinct differences from MCR's latest release, I enjoyed it just the same. \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\\" offers MCR with more of an edge (not to say they've dulled in the sophomore release-- we all know that's not true), more of a consistent hardcore bite, whereas the tracks on \\"...Revenge\\" vary in that aspect. My personal favorites off of \\"... Bullets...\\" are: \\"Vampires Will Never Hurt You\\", \\"Headfirst for Halos\\" and \\"Cubicles\\".
B000AARKOO|2.0|There's a ton of bone-crunching, writhing of swordblades and shields a'clashin. No doubt, it's good action. BUT, Orlando probably wasn't the best choice for the role, and the story is just so bland. Liam Neeson is in it for a whopping 90 seconds.<br /><br />Your thinking \\"Ridley Scott; it's got to be awesome\\". But alas they gave him a budget for good production value but the rest just sucks. It's definitely worth a look, and good for some mindless action, but you'll have buyers remorse if you purchase.
0064407667|5.0|This book is pretty good. But I think too many good things happen to them,visit the neibourgh too much,have a chance to see Mr. Poe. Otherwise, the book is very addicting. It is very short indeed. There is lots of discription in this book as well. If you're kids can't find anything to read,then get them this series. But be careful,if you read these books too much,you might start to get nightmares,so take a day or two break every once in a while. Overall,this is a great book. Buy it.
B000784WMW|4.0|Despite the low production values (I think most of it was shot on video rather than film, which is entirely excusable given the budget constraints of older BBC productions), this is the best motion picture version of Jane Eyre I have ever seen. The credit for this goes, in my opinion, almost entirely to one person: Timothy Dalton. He portrays Rochester perfectly, and I say this because [enter lit geek] I actually watched this once while following along with the book, and Dalton matched Bronte's descriptions of Rochester's inflections, facial expressions, and emotions scrupulously and to great dramatic effect. (Seriously, anyone inclined to do this should look at the proposal scene. It's uncanny.) [exit lit geek] Dalton is able to convey the many contradictions in Rochester's character and actions--his world-weariness, his humor, his surliness, his kindness, his depression, his barely contained passion, his selfishness, and his subtle, somewhat sinister, manipulativeness. For example, watch the manic matter-of-factness in his face when he says \\"It's not because she's mad that I hate her!\\" Watching Dalton, you can see why Rochester poses both a great temptation and a monumental threat to Jane--why she is so attracted to him, and yet has to leave him. My only criticism of Dalton as Rochester is that he is a bit too handsome, but I'm not complaining.  <br /> <br />I must agree with those who said that Zelah Clarke looks a bit too old to play Jane (Physically, Samantha Morton--1997--looks the part more than any other Jane Eyre I've seen.), and I need to add that Clarke's enunciation kind of bugged me, but otherwise I think she does an excellent job. Whether trading barbed witticisms or exchanging painful confidences, Clarke and Dalton interact with humor, affection, and intensity.  <br /> <br />The one problem with this version, and it is probably a direct result of sticking so close to the book, is that some of the speeches seem to go on a bit too long. But then, this production is more like a play than a movie, so soliloquies don't seem out of place. People who enjoy theater productions (and by this I don't mean _Cats_ or _Beauty and the Beast_) will probably get a lot more out of this production than those who are primarily used to Hollywood films.
0307276902|4.0|This is a very raw account of overt drug and alcohol abuse and the giving over of one's self to it even though death is certain if the abuse continues.  It is amazing that the author is able to give such a clear account of this time in his life while attempting recovery, considering his state of mind and being at the time. Incredible reading and not for the faint of heart.
0071181466|5.0|Nice introduction book to basic aerodynamics principles and theory, however you will need the Solution manual[...]
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|I am shocked to read some of these reviews. I felt this movie was way better than Ice Age. Not only was it funny, it kept both my 18 month old and 5 year old glued to the screen, not to mention the adults. It's about time they came out with something fresh. Compared to Ice Age, Shark's Tale, Polar Bear Express...this is by far the best children's movie I have seen in the theatre in the past year. Please don't let the other negative reviews keep you from watching this...you won't be sorry. I have a feeling Santa Claus will be bringing this movie with a box of dominoes this year for Christmas!!
6305428220|4.0|Not a very deep, but still very interesting and engaging film. Good for all ages, I guess. There are a few scary moments, but this is certainly not a horror movie. The plot is subtle, keeps you interested and in tension all the time. Nice choice for a purchase, it's worth it.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|This movie was pointless, plotless, and non-sensical.  OK, he's a rebel geek, we get it.  Bad hair, bad teeth, no dance moves.  The other characters were also pretty much one-dimensional as well.  The material might have been suited to a skit on SNL, not an entire movie.  There were some funny parts in this movie like the steak to the head, the button throw, and the ill-fated ramp jump(hence the 2 star rating) but most of it was pretty boring.  Repeatedly saying \\"gosh\\" in a stuffed-nose tone doesn't really do it for me, and certainly not for $20.
B000AA305M|1.0|David Gray's first album, White Ladder, came crashing down like a brick of sound. Filled with raw emotions and a band that complimented his music. Though all young they looked like musicians who had paid their dues to be where they are and they wore their music on their sleeves. <br /> <br />Everything from Gray's lyrics to his voice, down to the guitar he played spoke of uniqueness, pain, and music that you hear from a band in a late night session at an Irish pub, and you think where the hell have these people been. <br /> <br />Almost every track of the first album will literally capture you. The music is simply beautifully painful. And it remains one of our generations timeless albums. <br /> <br />The second album, A New Day At Midnight, clearly showed it had promise but it was rushed. Its sound was evident that the band settled on sending out tracks that were still in the making. And thus it became a horrible failure for Gray. <br /> <br />It is sadly painfully clear that the record label blamed Gray for this and thus assigned him a producer for his third album. <br /> <br />The DVD side of the third album shows a brief appearance of Gray's producer, who comes across as an extremely cocky individual seemingly taking credit for the entire album. But it is after listening to the album several times when you decide you want to see this man and choke him with your bare hands for destroying Gray completely. <br /> <br />The album is so over produced with melodic pianos and strings that it makes the worst Elton John album seem deep.  <br /> <br />There is only one redeeming track in the album entitled \\"Ain't No Love.\\" And even that, which would have undoubtedly been a master piece if it had been done with Gray and his band alone, is completely destroyed by overdone violins and synthesizers coming and going. Even the beginning of the track is polluted by some horribly clichd synthesizer sound. <br /> <br />This remains the only track worth Gray's name on the album. And of course it is the only one written solely by him. This, at least lyrically, remains unpolluted by this completely talentless producer. <br /> <br />The pain and the beauty of Gray as a lyricist pours through on this track. His voice and poetry remind you of why he is one of the most talented poets of our time. <br /> <br />But as a die hard Gray fan, the more you listen to it, the more you become sick as to how this gem of a song is so utterly destroyed by the album's producer. And let me tell you, it is and no matter how many times you listen to it, remains infuriating.  <br /> <br />In the DVD section, Gray constantly talks about how this is \\"the new me!\\" It is painfully clear that this product is not becoming of him and he is over and over again trying to convince himself that it's O.K. <br /> <br />He quotes people telling him how they did not like what he had done before, but that this piece of work is perfect. I gather these are the producer's friend. Strange, I thought the success of what he had done before was what had brought him here. It is actually sad to watch him constantly trying to convince not the just the viewer but himself that this effort is worth its purchase. <br /> <br />I bought the album because I am a Gray fan. And as a Gray fan I have to admit it is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. Although I still listen to the one track worthy of Gray's name, I have to admit its production still makes me feel like I am listening to some awful over produced, over clichd Barry Manilow album.  <br /> <br />So for now the same ghost that has haunted someone like Elton John and took him from being one of the most powerful musicians of our time to one whose current music makes even the most pop radio stations feel embarrassed to play, is the same ghost that is haunting Gray. <br /> <br />I am hoping Gray will find \\"his\\" grounds again. That would be something to listen to, cherish, and wrap around you when fall comes. <br /> <br />I am sad to saythis is not an album worth purchasing at any price.
B00004UEIF|1.0|This is by far the most distorted piano I've ever encountered on a jazz recording. Nothing else comes close. The bass solos are consistently accompanied by a high-pitched clicking sound. I've never heard the original vinyl disc or the earlier CD version, but I'd be extremely surprised if they were anywhere near this bad. I'd really like my money back.
0141439688|5.0|Jane Austen never fails to surprise, delight, amuse and intrigue me.  Persuasion is no different.  It's fabulous, I love it...I can't say it often enough--buy every book by Miss Austen and devour them.

0375759174|5.0|Another fabulous story by Jane Austen.  This may be \\"lite\\" as another reviewer suggested...but I've never found anything heavy about any of Austen's works.  They are all delightful to read.  It never fails to surprise me how little the dealings between men and women have changed over the past 200 years.  This was truly a joy to read and I would recommend it to everyone.  The characters and the storyline are full of humor and mystery...with a touch of debauchery thrown in.  FABULOUS!
B000002N2P|5.0|This album is one Green Day's best albums to date. It is filled with catchy tunes like No Pride, 86 and Walking Contradiction. Some say that this album is not as good as Dookie but that is untrue. Insomniac is one of Green Days most rocking albums. It is heavy on everything all the way through and when your done listening to it you'll wanna play it over again.This album is highly recommended and is well worth the money. You won't be disapointed!
B000AP04L0|5.0|One of my favorite all time movies.  I watched this movie shortly after it first came out on DVD after countless recommendations from coworkers and my boss (worked at a large broadband ISP/web portal company).  Like most people have said here, if you've worked in an office environment you just relate to Peter:  the butthole boss, the memos, standard operating procedures, the mandatory happy birthday singing, consultants, etc.  So many classic lines in this movie, \\"I'm gonna need you to move...\\", \\"Don't you want to express yourself\\", \\"you know the nazis had pieces of flair\\", \\"it's called a 'Jump to Conclusions'\\", \\"I celebrate his entire collection\\", the list goes on.  I have ripped a copy to my work PC and watch it when I'm bored and it never gets old.   <br /> <br />I wish they had more of Drew in the movie...  I wonder how his date with that girl in logistics went....
B000002IOY|5.0|A stellar album, after the underrated \\"Under The Influence, killer production, Bobby's vocals really started to form on this one, but, I always liked his voice, definetly different and cool sounding, they started exploring epic/old MetallicaESQUE songs here, great variety on this album, theres fast paced, mid-paced and a few slower-Sabbath-Like-Songs, lots of tempo changes as well, it blends well, heavy as hell, thrashes as well!, even funny at times!...sort of like Exodus, in the comical sense that is, the bands sound nothing alike, the first time I saw the video for \\"Elimination\\" when I was like 17, it had me thrashing about, I was already into old Metallica/Megadeth and stuff, and wanted to expand, my first Overkill was \\"Horrorscope\\" though, the one after this, but the song \\"Elimination\\" found on here was the song that got me into them, killer riffs, very heavy/fast, Bobby's very unique aggressive vocal style, it all fits, you may not like his voice at first, but give it time, Bobby is a really good vocalist, and definetly very different from the rest, kind of reminds you of Bon Scott and Bruce Dickinson in a way. <br /> <br />Time to Kill 5/6, A VERY NICE OPENER, changes around, fast..then midpaced..then slow and sludgy, very nice <br /> <br />Elimination 5/6, Here it is, a very killer song, ONE of the best on the album for sure, it's destructive, mostly fast paced here <br /> <br />I Hate 5/5, LOVE IT, this is what you play to your ex-girlfriend, \\"But most of all...I HATE YOU\\"-great lyrics! <br /> <br />Nothing to Die For 5/4, Not much to say, doesn't stand up to the first 3, but still a good song <br /> <br />Playing With Spiders/Skullkrusher 5/5, A very nice Sabbath-Like-Song, very sludgy, with heavy riffs, be warned though, it's VERY slow, could be a bit overlonged, but still killer <br /> <br />Birth of Tension 5/6, Killer song here, listen to that bass solo! <br /> <br />Who Tends The Fire 5/5, Another SabbathESQUE song, but a little faster in spots than Playing With Spiders, pretty much midpaced, slows down for the chorus <br /> <br />The Years of Decay 5/5, A ballad-like song, very nice though, adds variety, very melodic intro <br /> <br />E.vil N.ever D.ies 5/6, RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE FIRST 2, GREAT WAY TO CLOSE OFF A GREAT ALBUM, it's thrashy, heavy, and quite great, DO NOT SKIP THIS!!! <br /> <br />A great album overall, not a bit overrated either, it stands up to the hype it got...which wasn't TOO much, deserved more actually, as far as I'm concerned, Overkill should have been part of \\"The Big Four\\" instead of Anthrax...but you could also say Exodus, and Testament belonged in there as well...oh well, not going to get into that, all bands are great, and so was Overkill, they should have gotten A LITTLE more known, but no, due to Anthrax (BAH, one good album...), but I guess, seeing that Overkill wasn't part of the Bay Area, that could be why, but if you like old school Thrash, which if you do, you should already have this album, but if you don't, get it also check out \\"Taking Over\\" \\"Under The Influence\\" and \\"Horrorscope\\" if you ended up liking this, LATER!!

B0009R1T7M|5.0|Okay, so I live in Illinois so this review may be slightly biased, but come on...  This is one of those records that once you hear it you start wondering to yourself how torturous it would be had you never discovered it. (shudder...) Sufjan Stevens is a singular talent with such a broad creative musical vision that it blows this mere mortal's mind.  From the opening bars of Concerning the UFO Sighting... to the last bars of ...Laugh of Mankind you cannot help but marvel at the creativity of the ordeal.  The music is soothing, emotional, heartbreaking, devestating, disturbing, but above all there is Sufjan whose softspoken innocence, humility and startling honesty belie the grandiose 78 minutes of gargantuan musical bliss.  What does this record sound like?  Here are some suggestions:<br /><br />1.)A 3rd grade school musical about the state of Illinois complete with choir.<br /><br />2.)A pastoral, banjo driven folk album.<br /><br />3.)A Classical symphony or string quartet.<br /><br />4.)Nothing you've ever heard before in your life.<br /><br />But don't let me or Rolling Stone tell you how great this record is - go buy it and see for yourself that we (even if only once) were right.
0452282152|5.0|Let me first say that Girl with a Pearl Earring is possibly the best book I have ever read. With that in mind, I do hope you will let me explain why. This book, by Tracy Chevalier, is the story of how a young, plain, maid came to be the subject of one of the world's greatest paintings. The story is told by the maid, Griet, so it gives real insight as to what goes on in a 17th century Dutch society. There are vivid descriptions all throughout the book, describing everything from paintings by Johannes Vermeer to the Meat Hall in downtown Delft. Tracy Chevalier mixes history and fiction to create this near-perfect book. Not only does Griet tell how this painting came to be, but she also mentions and describes other paintings of Vermeer's that are recognizable. When you recognize a painting being described, you will be saying to yourself \\"Hey! I know what she's talking about!\\" In this way, the author makes a connection to the reader. Another way Chevalier relates you to her book is in the sense that she created a variety of characters, some likeable, some not. There are the daughters of Vermeer, and one is Cornelia, the sneakiest of the bunch. There is also loveable Maertge, whom Griet becomes fond of. The patron Van Ruijven, who buys paintings, is the character that is most hated by Griet, and also by the reader. I believe the thing I disliked about the book *cringe-this is killing me* was the ending. I wanted more and was disappointed. It might have just been that I was disappointed that it ended altogether. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of historical realistic fiction, or anyone who just plain likes to read. I think just about anyone and everyone will enjoy this amazing book!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|If you like musicals, this is one of my all time fav!  You would be surprised that it can actually relate to people of all ages, and isn't just like the ordinary pre-Wizard of Oz that you would imagine.  I give you my word that this is amazing that I saw it bring tears and smiles to both guys and girls. <br /> <br />I know at first my CD got lost in the mail, but they sent me another one free of charge over night with apologies once I told them.  I was thankful for this, and know I can rely on future purchases from Amazon.l
079284131X|3.0|The original Child's Play was just a one-off shocker that put a new-ish spin on the slasher genre by having the killer be a kids doll possessed with the soul of a dead serial-strangler (though Don Mancini's original script \\"Blood Buddies\\" was more of a satire on kid's marketing and did not feature Charles Lee Ray). It became clear afterwards that the outrageousness of the idea could lend itself to more humor-orientated sequels and that Chucky himself had potential that stretched beyond just one movie.<br /><br />As a result, this first Child's Play movie seems to be a bit different from the rest. Don't get me wrong, the franchise is pretty good with it's continuity, but first time around the makers played it for straight, which gives it different edge from the rest. Obviously they didn't want to play their ace right away so for the most part, Chucky is rather quiet in this one. Later on, his star would shine brighter.<br /><br />Judging the film on its own merits it's not exactly the best shocker out there. There are only a couple of scare moments and a couple of those are badly timed and obviously telegraphed. The story isn't as tight as it should be and there's simply not enough kills. The sequels had bigger body counts and more interesting deaths.<br /><br />MGM did a great job with the Blu Ray though. Child's Play was shot on 35mm with a plain 1.85:1 aspect ratio that has never a proper release. It looks and sounds brilliant in 1080p with lossless DTS HD-MA, and way better than I imagined it could. There are plenty of extras too. The rest of the movies were made by Universal, and I do hope that they look at the great presentation of this film and put the rest of the Chucky films out there in glorious high-def.
140003180X|5.0|This book is a definite improvement from the 3rd of the series (Morality for Beautiful Girls).  Interwoven stories involving the standard detective work and a new typing business dominate this charming, easy to read book.  But there's also a new detective in town, and he's a man (gosh!).  Not only is he a man, he is a chauvanist to boot.  How will Mma Ramotswe survive?  I encourage you to read and find out.
B00007K02F|4.0|I had avoided watching this version of Jane Eyre for almost 10 years for one compelling reason:  the thought of William Hurt as Rochester gave me a physical pain.  I couldn't imagine a blond and pasty Rochester with a tendency to squint and whine.  Mr. Hurt's American-ness also seemed like a colossal drawback in portraying a staple character of English literature, particularly as he was the only American in the cast.  I had visions of another laughable outing ala Kevin Costner as Robin Hood.  Having finally viewed it on a night with nothing better to do, I'm pleasantly surprised-He didn't bollocks it up!  I saw the classic version long ago with Orson Welles, and while his portrayal is hazy in my memory, he remains my image of Rochester as he was physically depicted in the novel.  However, with Hurt's blond hair darkened & sporting unflattering mutton-chop sideburns, he is transformed into a much rougher-looking version of his usual somewhat effete self, and so his interpretation of Rochester is not as ridiculous as first imagined.  To his credit he did not attempt a British accent; Bronte's dialog is quite stilted enough in a straight reading and that would've only made things much worse.  Paired with Charlotte Gainsbourg, he makes a surprisingly effective, if unconventional, Rochester.  His habitual pained expression actually serves the part.  Charlotte Gainsbourg steps into the part of Jane with a near-perfect fit.  She embodies Bronte's heroine in every detail but one: her distinct French accent is rather jarring in this most English of English girls.  She is most effective when she is still, and the camera lingers on her austere yet compelling face.  She lacks the spirit of Anna Paquin as young Jane, who is excellent in her all-too-brief role, but she nails Jane's solemn watchfulness & pride.  The transition between the two actresses is cleverly and plausibly handled as they suggest one another physically, even if they don't look exactly alike.  Gainsbourg and Hurt manage an awkward chemistry together which is appropriate, though they fail to solve one of the greatest mysteries of English literature:  Why exactly is 20-year-old Jane, whip-smart & nobody's fool, so drawn to this moody, brusque lout who is old enough to be her father?  Bronte never really explains it, so a movie adaptation can hardly hope to.  The movie, as the book, ends with Jane in the arms of her scarred, misanthropic boss, and we cheer, I guess . . .even though the smart move for Jane would have been to take her newly-inherited money & move to the Riviera or some other less-gloomy place.  Director Zeffirelli has assembled an all-star cast of heavy hitters to lend support, including Joan Plowright as Mrs. Fairfax, John Wood as the cruel & Dickensian master of Lowood School, Geraldine Chaplin playing against type as a cruel headmistress & Maria Schneider, in a tiny & essentially non-speaking part, as the crazy wife in the attic.  She is notable for just how changed she looks from her ingenue days in 'Last Tango in Paris'. Also deserving mention is the charming little French actress who plays Adele. All in all, a successful rendering, even Mr. Rochester.. <br />
0743454537|5.0|Every time I stepped in a book store, this book called me.  Every time I logged in to a book club site, this book called me.  After picking it up and putting it down and putting in my basket and taking it out.  I finally purchased it and I must say I was not disappointed.  I read this book in a day.  Literally, I read it in 12 hours.   <br /> <br />This is my first Jodi Picoult book and it was great.  You are taken on this emotional roller coaster right along with the characters in the book.  I will not tell you the story as others do, but I will say this, the ending, as good as it was, was also not neccessary. It brought tears to my eyes that lasted quite a few minutes.
1400032717|5.0|Christopher Boone is a teenager like many others, although he has some peculiarities and a unique outlook on life. The reason for this is that he has Asperger's Syndrome, an illness that in his case includes symptoms like a strong dislike of being touched by other people, a compulsion to tell the truth, and finding comfort in patterns.<br /><br />As you read this book, you will learn more about Christopher and the way his mind works, because he is the narrator of a story that becomes unique not due to its content, but due to the way it is told. For those who don't know much about autism, like me, this is a very good way to start to learn...<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple. The dog of one of Christopher's neighbours is killed, and he takes upon himself the task of discovering the culprit. That is only the beginning of a series of incidents that would lead Christopher to the discovery of many secrets and to the adventure of a lifetime.<br /><br />\\"The curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" is likely to become a classic as years pass by. Its author, Mark Haddon, should be congratulated on having written a book that is entertaining, yes, but also brings home a lesson we all need to keep in mind: being different, like Christopher, doesn't mean being less. It only means having a different outlook on life.  All in all, highly recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat
0307276902|3.0|Yes it's a good story.  Is it believable?  The jury is still OUT!  I try to read all Oprah book club suggestions.  Some I made it through some I haven't.  All the hpye Oprah and her staff have generated, as to how it keep them up all night, and how it is a page turner, about this book left me so unfulfilled.  Yes, I wanted to know what eventually happened to James at the end.  And yes, I WAS ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN (It actually took me 2 weeks to read this one).  Good story, but Don't Believe the Hype!
0451169514|3.0|Where do I start.  It's not really a horror novel, but a coming of age novel about friendship.  I was never scared or freaked out by the book and the ending is just the worst.  I won't tell you about  the ending, but I could've wrote a far better ending then that.  It was almost like reading a Harry Potter kids novel...Disappointed.
B000002HRE|5.0|Actually, 4 1/2 stars.    This album, I'm assuming, is a companion to \\"Load,\\" a very good album with a bold new direction by Metallica. If heard together, definitely both albums deliver the goods as far as nuanced sounds, lyrics, and attitude to the all-new, all-different Metallica. As an album by itself, \\"Reload\\" is still a pretty good album. It starts off great with \\"Fuel,\\" an anthem for fast cars and just going crazy; and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with the seductive humming from Marianne Faithfull. And, of course, the ballad that is \\"The Unforgiven II,\\" one of my personal favorites. Though some songs escape me, like \\"Carpe Diem Baby,\\" \\"Prince Charming,\\" and \\"Fixxxer,\\" there are other lesser-known, but better sounding, songs like \\"Low Man's Lyric\\" and \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" to make up for it. The acoustical, gin-joint sound works for some songs, but for others tends to fall flat.     Still, Metallica never fails to rock and provoke a thought at the same time. And with \\"Reload,\\" their track record is still impeccable.
B000B9EY2U|4.0|I love that Depeche Mode have been around for 25 years and still put out consistently good music, however subdued on recent efforts. That their new album is as energetic and experimental as it is so late in the game, well, the electronic geek that I am is thrilled to the darkest recesses of my heart and soul. The band members have given statements reflecting their newfound invigoration and on _Playing the Angel_ it shows. Mixed within the dour, quintessential synth pop beats are loads of new sounds unheard on previous records. In fact, despite comparisons and nods to its predecessors, _Playing The Angel_ could just as easily be compared to the current trend from another industrial act; VNV Nation's latest _Matter + Form_ also utilized analog synthesizers for interesting wave-like effects.  For example, \\"The Sinner in Me\\" abrades with scraping synths on the edge of bursting distortion that still manage to facilitate the lift of the melody in the chorus only to cut that melody down even harder like some kind of morose joke. This is then followed immediately by the groove-ready, upbeat didjeridoo-ish percussions of \\"Precious\\" (a similar effect repeated again with lesser intensity in the background of \\"I Want it All\\") and its sullen and regretful first verse, \\"Precious and fragile things / Need special handling / My God what have we done to you...\\" And though the track sequencing may seem jarring at first, after hearing the album straight through for the umpteenth time, the pacing and versatility of arrangements makes for an enjoyably varied listening experience. Perhaps as much fun to listen to as David Gahan claimed of being in DM lately, from the horn blasted intro of \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" (seemingly borrowed from Exciter's \\"Dead of Night\\" - and thrilled to death to hear it, as I missed not hearing more of the same from that album) to the industrial romp stomp of \\"John the Revelator\\" to the looming gloom and echoing murk of \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" (a personal favorite) to the faintly familiar chorus in \\"Damaged People,\\" the matter-of-fact statement \\"pain and suffering in various tempos\\" printed on the back of the CD jacket is only fitting, especially for anyone who enjoys trolling the dark waters of the human spirit.
B000AL730Y|4.0|A new Paul McCartney album is usually approached with certain amount of trepidation, especially with Sir Paul's tendency to lean towards all things cheesy, and sometimes of the extra mature, vintage farmhouse type. But what's going on here? Is this really the McCartney we all know and love/hate?? Once you recover from the shock and give it another listen (preferably with decent speakers or headphones) you should discover subtle, and often beguiling elements in both the songs and the overall production.  Nigel Godrich certainly has a lot to be thanked for in his shaping of the album by not letting Paul get his own way, and exercising a greater sense of quality control on the material than usually observed on previous albums. Apart from 'Fine Line' - the only song that has single written all over it - the standout tracks for me are 'Jenny Wren', 'Too Much Rain', 'Riding to Vanity Fair' and 'At the Mercy', maybe because these explore an oft-neglected territory for McCartney, a deeper emotional statement than his usual head-in-the-clouds optimism, with no really 'big' choruses, but little twists and turns that will soon be nagging at your brain and demanding another listen. I'm not sure if I'll ever really warm that much to 'English Tea',(have a word, Nigel!) but who knows, maybe after a few more listens (I'm currently on my 4th) I will discover other layers that I didn't hear before, such is the nature of the production.   <br />So, can we expect more from this McCartney/Godrich team before Paul starts collecting his pension? I hope so. <br /> <br /> <br />

B0000TLA9G|3.0|Guns and Roses was one of the most influential bands of the 1980's and 1990's. Coming out of the L.A. scene with their debut album, \\"Appetite for Destruction\\", Guns n' Roses was a hardcore rock band. After the commercial success with that album, Axl Rose and the band, consisting of Slash, Izzy Stradlin, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum (replacing Steve Adler) started on their next album, Use Your Illusion. GnR LIES came out to hold the fans over between albums and is just their EP with a few more tracks. When Use Your Illusion I and II came out, the were met with a mixed reaction. With hits like \\"November Rain\\" and \\"You Could Be Mine\\", the albums were declared a commercial success. The Spaghetti Incident? came out 2 years later and flopped. Soon all members of the band left except Axl Rose, who declared that he was starting a new album called \\"Chinese Democracy\\", which has yet to be released. <br /> <br />\\"Guns N Roses: Greatest Hits\\" takes the commercial successes and puts them on one 80 minute CD. Beginning with \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and ending with a Rolling Stones cover \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\", Greatest Hits takes 3 songs from Appetite for Destruction, 1 from GnR LIES, 3 from Use Your Illusion I 4 from Use Your Illusion II, and 2 from The Spaghetti Incident? <br /> <br />My main problem with this compilation was the drastic amount of cover songs. 5 of the 14 songs here are cover songs. \\"Knockin on Heaven's Door\\" is a great cover and is the only cover that should be on here. \\"Ain't it Fun\\" and \\"Since I don't have you\\" should have been taken off in favor of \\"Estranged\\". \\"Live and Let Die\\" should of been with \\"My Michelle\\" and \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" should be for \\"Mr. Brownstone\\". <br /> <br />In all, if you own the 5 studio albums, then there is no reason to get this compilation unless you need \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" which is not such a good cover. If you have a friend who is just a casual fan and wouldn't mind a few missing songs here and there, by all means, get this album for them.
B00005JKES|2.0|I was looking at the Season 1 for awhile and then decided to check out the UK release of Twin Peaks. It was released by Paramount in 2002 and contains the pilot. So if you don't want to wait for paramount to release it in the US check it out. It's currently listed at slightly over 15, so not to bad. <br /> <br />Hope this helped, otherwise this release isn't to bad
B00006SFLV|5.0|I can't say much about this show. It's simply too difficult to express in words. It is THE BEST DRAMATIC TELEVISION SHOW EVER MADE! It has been said it applies only to depressed white teen girls, but I'm an upbeat white teen male, so I consider that remark bullploop.  <br />What makes this show amazing is its reality. I mean, how many shows before this one realistically depicted 15 year olds drinking, having sex, being gay, donig drugs, etc. Most media will not admit these things happen till final year of high school. But they DO happen. Young, young, teens do drink, do smoke, do have sex, and not in a ha-ha-it's-a-joke sort of way. When you watch this show it seems REAL. The characters talk realistically, the problems are NOT solved in the 55 minute confine of the show, and the problems are REALISTIC. I admit, the early episodes can seem fairly childish, but the show evolved into something SO MUCH more than the tale of Angela Chase. And it never seems to be preaching to you. It never seems after-school-specialish.  <br />I discovered the show recently, playing in reruns at midnight on the Family Channel, and was very displeased to discover that only 19 episodes were made. WHAT AN INJUSTICE! <br />While people are discovering the amazing actress known as Claire Danes in the movie \\"Shopgirl\\", MSCL fans have known how amazing she was for years.
B000002HH2|4.0|\\"Post\\" is one of the most amazing albums of all time because it is strangely alternative, yet very listenable. It's not too far musically from the dance/techno oriented \\"Debut\\", but it's much more mature and powerful. The opening track, \\"Army Of Me\\" sounds frightening at first, with it's bottom-dwelling bass and chilling vocals, but it's a very catchy song. It segues into the beautiful, shimmering \\"Hyper-ballad\\", which mixes lush strings, gentle keyboards and Bjorks' gentle, sorrowful voice. One of the most beautiful songs she has ever recorded. \\"The Modern Things\\" has un-used potential: it's good, but not that good. Basically it's kind of like filler. A lot of Bjork fans hate \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\", but it's simply a song that requires a broeader musical view. Her vocals are awesome in it. \\"Enjoy\\", a little rough around the ears the first time you hear it, but very catchy, just like \\"Army Of Me\\". \\"You've Been Flirting Again\\" is a beautiful strings ballad, but it's a shame it's only an interlude and not an entire song. Then comes the magnificent \\"Isobel\\", a stunning combination of hidden sexual lyrics, majestic strings and Bjorks' lovely, smooth vocal. \\"Possibly Maybe\\" is a very sad song: it tells the story of a relationship from its' beginning, through its' good and bad times, all the way to the end. The music and Bjorks' voice changes throughout the song, so it's very emotional. \\"I Miss You\\" is a very weird song (not as weird as the video for it) that mixes brazilian drums with trumpets gallore. It's not bad, but that's all it is. \\"Cover Me\\" is kinda creepy, spacey, that harp really makes your skin rise. Too bad it's so short. Last, but definitely not least, we have the enchanting \\"Headphones\\", a song about how music can influence a person's behaviour and make them float away into a dream relm. It's a beautiful song, one of Bjorks' many masterpieces. <br />All in all a fantastic album. If you think it's too weird and if you're not into alternative music, you should still buy it, because it's very catchy, sometimes really cooky and weird, but sometimes breathtaking and beautiful. And it's so ahead of its' time: it was released in 1995!?! Sounds more like 2000. or something! <br />Don't have doubts, buy it! You'll like it, more or less.
0307276902|5.0|I currently hold a position where I deal with clients addicted to cocaine, marijuana, alcohol, as well as those who only dabble in such habits. I decided that with my work, I would expand my understanding of being completely consumed and controlled by drugs and drinking. I searched Amazon and found James Frey's memoir.  <br />I quickly bought this book, and as drugs wholly enveloped James, this book sucked me in, kept hold. I would read this book at home, at work, whenever I had a spare moment. I applaud his bravery in writing such a candid tale of his recovery. I feel I can now understand my clients better and what kind of needs they have.  <br />My heart was so full of hope with the end of this book, not only for its author, but for those I work with every day. I may be the only one in my profession who takes her work home with her - thinking about the choices people are making, while I make my own. I hope that my clients who have been through Rehab can be just as successful. <br />I would highly recommend this read to anyone, including those closest to me in private life and profession. I have NEVER been so completely moved by a work of literature.  <br />I am glad Oprah got a hold of this novel and is sharing it with women all around the world. It is important that everyone be educated on the evils that exist and haunt so many.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There are two givens in life: the way things are and the way things ought to be.  Obviously at Fox, the road less traveled is the one taken where they wouldn't know a hit if it bit them in the ... The road of common sense. <br />I agree with the others that the show is done extremely well, great acting, good script (sometimes cheesy), but great, solid entertainment.  We too use to watch more TV until all the fast-paced, empty content shows took over.  <br />A big shame that it's canceled, perhaps, like the movie version \\"Serenity,\\" if enough fans rise to the occassion and shout their love of the show - we can resurrect it..who knows... I know that I'll be in line to pick up the DVD collection - a sure classic!
0307276902|2.0|Okay, admittedly, \\"nothing\\" may be a bit harsh but it isn't that far off.  This book was nowhere near deserving of the hype it has received.  After hearing Oprah's staff rave about it, I was expecting to have a life-altering experience.  Didn't happen.  Interesting?  Sure.  Well written?  For the most part.  But worthy of all the accolades it's received?  Hardly.  This may be my last book club read for a while.  And to all those who claimed that this is the most graphic, raw and brutally honest thing they've ever read:  try to get out more.
B000001FAO|5.0|This CD is the Cream of Cream. This is not only a great CD it is one of the classic albums of all time.  Eric Clapton on this CD becomes the legand he is known for now.  Cream were three musicians who were innovative and talented.  The songs of note on this CD are. Strange Brew, Dance the Night away, SWABLR, Sunshine of your Love, which is their signature song to this day and always be.  The Wah Wah on tales of Brave Ulysses shows the master doing a song that even rivals the late Jimi Hendrix.  Outside Woman blues is another song that holds up to this day.  If you like Cream or if you want to listen to Cream for the first time this is the CD you need to listen to first.  This is worthy of any collection, Cream or otherwise

B00004W510|5.0|Everyone knows this is a masterpiece. But I have never read that this music is actually PROGRESSIVE ROCK, American style. Forget Happy the Man or Kansas or whatever. They were imitations of European styles. But The Band is, indeed, very progressive. It is to America what Genesis was to England.  (Do I hear a guffaw?) First, just like Genesis incorporated traditions from Britain's culture (church hymns, folk music, and a very English humour), The Band drank deeply from all things Americana. They  speak with the voices of bluegrass, and soul, and the blues. Sure! The songs aren't that long, but many an Italian prog lp presented the listener with short tunes. Not only that, but Garth Hudson beats Rick Wakeman to the keyboard punch with every chord.  And is this music complex? Listen To \\"Rockin' Chair.\\" Listen to \\"Whispering Pines.\\" So...my diatribe is over. But think about it when mentioning the great prog bands of  North America (four of the band members were Canadian!). In my humble opinion, The Band is the prog masterwork from this side of the ocean. It is our Foxtrot. <br /> <br />
B00097A5HW|2.0|This CD really disappointed me.. I have been a fan of Shakira for a long time, I adore Donde Estan Los Ladrones and Piez Descalzos.. I was not happy with her Laundry Service album, either--referring to the Spanish songs--and I do not like this. Yes, her voice is beautiful, it has always been beautiful, and it always will be. She definately has a more American sound throughout the CD. I feel like she shows depth throughout the album, and she shows a range of voice, but it just does not have the fire of the other ones. None of the songs are very memorable outside of the lyrics themselves.. she sounds very soft and almost bored while she is singing in some songs. I feel like this is a different Shakira, one who has come of age, and mellowed a bit. I miss the guitar, I miss the fire, I miss the raw passion of the past. I am disappointed by her return to Spanish.
B000A6T1KE|1.0|I don't know what version of the film Jeff Shannon watched, but I'd certainly like to see it because it isn't the one I saw. \\"One of the best in the series\\"? Hardly. Try the other way around. This is undoubtedly the most difficult Star Trek film I have ever tried to watch. I've attempted to sit through it three times in the hope that maybe a shimmer of good would come through for me...alas, it is not to be I'm afraid. Everything \\"N. Stock\\" said is 100% true and on the money. This is, in my opinion, the worst of the entire series of films, O.S. and TNG combined. Most people seem to agree that Star Trek V: The Final Frontier was the worst, but at least there's a sense of adventure which is sadly lacking in Nemesis. Star Trek V also had, in my opinion, some of the richest character interaction between Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Jerry Goldsmith's score is a joy to listen to as always. Sadly, that is the only thing Nemesis has going for it. The characters aren't even fun to watch. These characters we had come to enjoy watching on ST:TNG are cardboard cutouts of their television selves. Rick Berman is either trying to save face or he's living in denial. I think it's time Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens took over the reins of the Star Trek franchise. It's a shame Enterprise was canceled just when it was actually getting interesting with them as writers, producers and story editors. Season 4 of that series is what season 1 should have been. But, I'm straying off subject...Nemesis is without a doubt my least favorite of all 10 films and in my opinion, the absolute worst of the lot.
B000AA302U|5.0|This offering by Jamiroquai is amazing.  From my first listen I was hooked.  Its unfortunate that there are people who will always believe that nobody will ever put out anything as good as their first however many albums.  You gotta grow with the artist!  If the artist put out stuff that was just like their last release, they'd be stagnant performers, not artists. <br /> <br />Anyway, listen to the samples and then buy the CD.  I just wish people in the US appreciated what Jay and his crew have to offer.  This will get you dancin' and feelin' good.  Check it out!
B000AARKOO|1.0|Enough, already! I'm tired, dog-tired, of the hackneyed, predictable and perturbing portrait of Christianity in general--and of Catholicism in particular--that movies like Kingdom of Heaven (or, take King Arthur as another disturbing example) foist upon the (presumably) ignorant masses.     In this film, virtually every historical Christian, i.e., Catholic, is cast as blasphemous, fanatical or, when showing any positive qualities at all, as decidedly anti-Catholic(!) in their sentiment--as those who merely endure their membership in the Church for simple lack of anything better to do at the time, but who actually march to the tune of their own, self-styled and flippantly proclaimed creeds. The crusaders, conspicuously bearing the Cross, are shown to be nothing more than lusty, greedy, bloodthirsty opportunists. The ecclesiastics (priest and bishop alike) are caricatured as self-absorbed, thieving, sniveling, cowardly buffoons. On the other hand, Muslims, given more popular press, are depicted as a people with an obviously higher and better strain of spirituality than those \\"dirty, rotten\\" Christians.     But the real hero is the ever \\"Enlightened Pagan\\" or, at best, the supremely \\"Syncretistic Pelagian,\\" who shows us that \\"real\\" men don't really need the useless trappings of the Church--or religion, for that matter--in order to become \\"real, good\\" men. The true hero is the man who, answering to himself and no one else--including God, forges his own faith; the man who promotes religious tolerance to the point of acknowledging no religion at all, and ultimately of having no religion himself. For it is then, and only then, that the world--rid especially of those problematic Christians--will be a far, far better place for you and for me and for everyone else.     In short, a sickeningly revisionist rewrite of the crusades, motivated by a deliberate and rapidly tiresome anti-Catholic agenda. The idea advanced in the film that crusading supposedly absolved one's sins is absurd. Or how about \\"Christian Jihad\\" in the cry from the crazy-faced priest welcoming the crusaders into the Holy Land: \\"Killing an infidel isn't murder! It's the gateway to heaven!\\"? Or the shot of the knight allegedly praying the Rosary two or three centuries before this devotion gained a foothold in popular piety? Those who will so desperately to rid their present day world of Christianity, but who desperately fail, then revert to trying to rid the historical world of Christianity. In the latter attempt, Kingdom of Heaven (along with The Da Vinci Code, King Arthur and others of its ilk) fails desperately--again.     If you want to know what really happened, turn off your TV, get a good history book of the Crusades and read it. If you prefer a fictionalized fantasy/action adventure, whereby you may absent yourself from using your mind while abandoning yourself wholesale to the propaganda of Hollywood film-makers, watch Kingdom of Heaven. Your willful ignorance is their obscene bliss.
0525948023|5.0|I have enjoyed Eckhart's books and this one is no exception. I was happy to see that Walmart is even carrying it. Maybe the world has a chance after all. As with all spiritual teachers, each one has a certain style, and people that resonate with the style and the teacher can really let the message in. If there is some resistance to the teacher or style, maybe it isn't right for you, or, scarier even, maybe it is right for you. When I first met some of my most effective teachers, my ego tried to come up with all the reasons why not to be with them. Luckily I didn't really listen to it because there was something deeper that rang true. If there is something about the teacher that bothers me, I really try to look within. Many times I realize that what bothers me is something I do that I do not like about myself. Interesting! <br />I really like Eckhart and have enjoyed his talks, books. I haven't been on retreat with him, but I have with other teachers that are teaching the same message. One that you may have heard of is Gangaji. She is the kind of teacher that just by sitting with her in the same room will bring up all your stuff to be seen. She has a new book out called The Diamond in Your Pocket. Eckhart actually wrote the forward in it. See her at gangaji.org. Her message is even more simple than Eckhart's. She simply says \\"Stop. Be Still.\\" Any strategies actually turn you away from the moment. This stopping reveals self deeper and deeper as it is trusted and one is willing to be still. It has been a blessing in my life. Eckhart is a support for this. It really is your own heart calling you home. Whatever form you hear it from is perfect for you. May all beings awaken to the truth of themselves.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|There's many instances of this happening: film/cd/tv show gets released, people rave about it, people check it out and call it overrated. I always think that people do this because either it was too hyped or they just hate it because it's popular. So is the case with Titanic and in some cases they're right. Love story needs work as it takes awhile for anything to happen then whoosh, some of the most intense and gripping action filmed. Back in the era of theatrical trailers and production notes listed as the only special feature, we finally get the tricked out version. <br /> <br />You pretty much know the story. In fact, there's not enough here to warrant a paragraph as it's simply this: old Rose tells present day treasure hunters who are looking for an incredibly rare and valuable diamond the story of when she actually wore the thing on Titanic the night it sank. This also ties into what is essentially her soulmate, third class free spirit Jack. This of course happens right before Titanic meets the iceberg. <br /> <br />Now, I will agree: the love story needed some more re-writes. It's a bit trite and some scenes should've been cut. But then the ship hits the iceberg and holy **** this film's great. The sound design and the production literally gave me goosebumps, especially certain scenes. Not to mention that the main theme(not the \\"ooh's\\" that you here during the main title and a key moment at the end), it's actually the \\"aah's\\" at the end when it does a big long shot. It starts when we see a picture of Rose riding a horse. It's so incredibly haunting yet beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br />The bonus features are quite nice but part of me wants more stuff. There's very little featurettes on the digital effects, only miniature shots or what they call ship extensions where they add to the set they had to make it match the real ship's length. There's a feature on the first 2 discs called pods which are kind of like the white rabbit featurettes on the Matrix disc or the Web-i-sodes on the Spiderman discs. There's an incredibly handy play all feature so you don't have to watch the film to access the pods. On disc 2 is the alternate ending which plays fine as a scene but doesn't fit(I'm not a director and even I think so). It does have a hilarious line by Lewis though. <br /> <br />On disc 3 we have the other featurettes such as video diary. A big feature is 29(!) deleted scenes, a lot of them exercised for good reason. The fight between Jack and Lovejoy(briefly seen in the trailers) is good but would've broke the film's pace. I have to jump back to the first 2 discs but James Cameron's commentary is a must-listen: it's informative on all fronts such as what a shot entailed, ad-libs and accidents and even some historical knowledge(and he also either agrees or shoots down things people had issues with such as Rose giving the finger or the infamous \\"I'm the king of the world!\\". <br /> <br />I don't know where he's going next after this. He's apparently working on an adaptation of the anime Battle Angel Alita so I'm looking for to that but as his last film from 8 years ago, this is a keeper. <br /> <br />FYI: I prefer the original cover better without Leo, Kate and Jim on the front.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Ok David Bowie is an amazing musician, songwriter etc. His music has paved a new road in rock history for the more bizarre and outgoing. From glame rock, pop rock, blues rock, jazz rock, dance rock, space rock, and even some industrial work with later stuff.<br /><br />Bowie is incredible and his music is very fun, impressive, different, happy, upbeat and quite moving. This album is amazing and every song is great \\"Soul Love\\", \\"Star Man\\", \\"Five Years\\" etc. Also get most of his other records like \\"Station to Station\\", \\"Scary Monsters\\", \\"Space Oddity\\", \\"Hunky Dory\\", \\"Outside\\", \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\", \\"Aladdin Sane\\" and of course \\"Ziggy Stardust\\". I love Bowie, at first I was a bit iffy on him for some reason, but man did that change fast, I now own 14 of his albums, and love them all. He is my favorite singer song writer next to Neil Young. I got big into Bowie and you should too, and with that said here are some other bands I got into that are similar to the style of Bowie in some sort of a way.......<br /><br />ROXY MUSIC: A band I've always heard of, but when I actually heard them, I thought they were great. Very cool glame rock band with tons of talent.<br /><br />TALKING HEADS: Iffy on them for a while as well, but grew out of that, because they are great! I'd say they are a cross between Roxy Music + a happier version of Joy Division.<br /><br />JOY DIVISION: Really cool, and a nice find. Very dark version of The Cure in my book, very cool mellow strange band. Dark and ahead of their time.<br /><br />THE CURE: Very moving inspiring band that girls tend to really dig. Very upbeat and at times very nice and mellow.<br /><br />NINE INCH NAILS: Inspired by Bowie, but sounds quite different, for fans of Bowies darker, hard rock, industrial, electronic approach. Try out Bowies album \\"Outside\\" underated, Trent Reznor and Bowie cover a Bowie song from \\"Outside\\", Hearts Filthy Lesson.<br /><br />Elton John: Has a sound like Bowies Pop Rock songs. Great classic piano rock artist that everyone should already know.<br /><br />U2: Great band, but only really great in the early 80s, U2 in the 90s didn't do it for me, they just don't sound like they do with \\"October\\", \\"Joshua Tree\\", \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", \\"Boy and \\"War\\".<br /><br />REM: Great band, I must say I pretty much like all of their albums almost equaly, well except for their most recent, its just decent. 80s and early 90s stuff is amazing.<br /><br />Billy Joel: 2 Disc Greatest Hits is all I really need, I grew up on him, all those hits on his 2 discer bring back old memories of my first house.<br /><br />Yes: Great band, well I like them anyways, even though they go a little overboard with some of their songs and make them really long, but very cool and fun.<br /><br />Bands David Bowie got inspiration from:<br /><br />The Beatles<br /><br />The Rolling Stones<br /><br />The Who<br /><br />Bob Dylan<br /><br />Anything else good before him<br /><br />David Bowie (The Man Who Sold The World)(Ziggy)(Rock Legend)<br /><br />Buy this masterpiece of an album, A huge step for him.reat classic piano rock artist that everyone should already know. <br /> <br />U2: Great band, but only really great in the early 80s, U2 in the 90s didn't do it for me, they just don't sound like they do with \\"October\\", \\"Joshua Tree\\", \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", \\"Boy and \\"War\\". <br /> <br />REM: Great band, I must say I pretty much like all of their albums almost equaly, well except for their most recent, its just decent. 80s and early 90s stuff is amazing. <br /> <br />Billy Joel: 2 Disc Greatest Hits is all I really need, I grew up on him, all those hits on his 2 discer bring back old memories of my first house.  <br /> <br />Yes: Great band, well I like them anyways, even though they go a little overboard with some of their songs and make them really long, but very cool and fun.  <br /> <br />Bands David Bowie got inspiration from: <br />The Beatles <br />The Rolling Stones <br />The Who <br />Bob Dylan <br />Anything else good before him <br /> <br />David Bowie (The Man Who Sold The World)(Ziggy)(Rock Legend) <br /> <br />Buy this masterpiece of an album, A huge step for him.
B000AADYYO|5.0|I must confess that I have waited for this album like a kid waits for his birthday presents. <br /> <br />I think 1988 was  the year that I had the same feeling when Slayer released \\"South of Heaven\\", Metallica released \\"And Justice for All\\" and Anthrax released \\"State of Euphoria\\".  <br /> <br />Tough Opeth and Opeth albums are pretty much different compared to the aforementioned genre, my feeling that Opeth is carrying the flag of metal - rock - prog metal - death metal - whatever- along with a few other bands, is growing stronger with each album.  <br /> <br />First of all I liked the new sound created with the addition of keys. Secondly I feel that this album is not only a combination of the previous albums, but also Opeth has brought something new to the table - again. They are evolving and progressing with each album, and that's what the concept of progressive music entails. Thirdly and surprisingly I feel that this is the most aggressive Opeth album - in spite of the fact that they now have a full-time keyboard player and using more progressive elements ever.   <br /> <br />The added keyboards really contributed to the overall sound without taking much from the original Opeth atmosphere. Only negative comment I can make is the drum sound. The drum sound in Deliverance was far superior. I think the snare was over-silenced in this one, and this caused the drums to sound too weak overall- which is a bad idea if you consider the fact that Lopez is not a hard hitter-. However I think Ghost Reveries is Lopez's best performance. There aren't many drummers out there who play ghost strokes over a double bass drum pattern.  <br /> <br />I liked all of the songs, especially Ghost of Perdition, The baying of the hounds, Reverie/Harlequin Forest and The Grand Conjuration. Others may favor different songs and I don't have a problem with that.  <br /> <br />It was worth waiting for. If this is the new direction Opeth is taking, then I am quite OK with it. However I am quitesure the next album will be surprising again. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|A must buy for those who loved this movie. When I first knew of the movie I thought to myself, ok theres been other Titanic movies, but seriously, being released in the time it was with or new use of special effects, I knew it would be an amazing visual movie to watch, especially with action director James Cameron behind the helm. Impressive movie, the epic scale and visuals blow me away, honestly the love story could have been stronger though.<br /><br />I enjoy Leo in a number of films, but James Cameron is not known for his romance portrayed on film, but the huge epic sets, action, intensity, sound and suspense put into his work like Aliens, The Abyss, True Lies, Terminater 1 and 2.<br /><br />Titanic is the best movie about Titanic you'll ever see, mostly for action wise. I saw an older version and the boat in that sank really fast and looked kinda funny. I just knew it would be done right this time, and oh man was it, especially the smoke pipe falling down and the boat breaking in half. Very mucho on the special features in a DVD set everyones been waiting for, even the people who laugh at the guy hitting the propellar. Admit it, it is a great film.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I have had this CD for the longest time...its a MUST BUY!  If you like rap, or even Eminem, buy this cd!  My favorite songs are Marshall Mathers and Criminal...the lyrics are just so insane!  You should listen to this cd (see above) and then buy it.  Im telling you, this is a great work of art!
B000A6T1KE|2.0|Someday, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga are going to wake up and realize just how lame this movie was.  I've read a ton of excuses on why Nemesis did so poorly.  I have yet to hear them say \\"We made a bad movie.\\"  Enterprise didn't kill Trek (shoot, half the country couldn't watch it, it WAS on UPN); this movie murdered it.
B00005JOI3|5.0|Psychiatrist Sam Foster (McGregor) is filling in for a co-worker when he meets Henry Letham (Gosling).  Henry clearly has some problems, and when he tells Sam that he is going to kill himself in a few days on his 21st birthday, Sam decides to try to save him.  As Sam begins to look into Henry's life, he finds the line between reality and illusion begin to blur.<br /><br />\\"Stay\\" is all of that and none of that at the same time.  Things are not what they seem, and it is interesting to watch things unfold.  What could have been a huge twist at the end is instead diffused by scenes early on the let the audience in on what is happening.  In fact, it is possible to know what is going on from the very beginning of the film.  What makes the movie great is the journey they characters take on the way to the inevitable end.<br /><br />Director Marc Forster does an amazing job of making all things tie together.  If something in the movie seems odd, it is there for a reason, and if you pay close enough attantion, you will see what I mean.  The acting is good as well, but is not what makes the movie so good.  \\"Stay\\" is an entertaining and thought provoking film that I highly recommend.
B000AARKOO|4.0|In my opinion I thought this was a really good movie, I agree with others in that this movie was unfairly judged at the box office.  <br /> <br />When I went it came out I could'nt wait to go see it, because these are my kind of movies....I love war/fantasy/historical epics types of movies. The movie from what I read before was cut short. I heard there was suppose to be an extended version of the movie. The theatrical was like 2 hours and 25 minutes and I read that the extended version is going to be 3 hours and 25 minutes.   You can tell because if you watch the trailer, you see that the theatrical is missing some parts.....but I don't know........I HOPE THEY COME OUT WITH AN EXTENDED VERSION!!!!. <br /> <br />The acting was pretty decent. Some real good acting came from Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Saladin, David Thewlis, The King of Jerusalem & Brendan Gleeson( He rocked in BraveHeart) <br /> <br />The seens are very well done. I remember I got really disappointed in the theater during the seen when. Balian's calvary charges at the Muslim cavalry and then he wakes up and talks to Saladin servant( I forgot his name but he did some good acting too) and he sees Saladin's 200,000 men marching down towards them and then they see the army of Jerusalem. It disappointed me because I thought they were going to fight right then and there and have a big battle........but they didnt :( <br /> <br />The siege of Jerusalem was a good battle it was pretty fast though, but It's not even in the same league as the Siege of Gondor or the Battle of Pelennor Fields or the Battle of Helm's Deep( Im a huge Lord of the Rings fan). Balian said \\"FIRE\\" so many times during those battle sequences... <br /> <br />But yeah overall the movie is a 4 out of 5.....It's a very good movie, its worth buying and I hope they'll have a Extended Version. <br /> <br />P.S. During the extras, I think it was probably Ridley who said that Kingdom of Heaven was bigger than Gladiator........Sorry Ridley....Gladiator was far better, it had a better storyline and better acting and action. But hey Kingdom of Heaven isn't that far behind.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|If you are an Eagles fan and enjoy all thier old 70's mega-hits, you need to purchase this fantastic DVD as soon as possible!  The DTS sound quality is exceptional.  It may be the best concert DVD I have ever seen...and I own 40+ concert DVD's! <br />The clear visuals and crystal clear music makes anyones stereo system sound like it cost $1 million bucks! <br />This is no hype...if you like the Eagles, this is the best way to see them sing....I just saw them live in Oakland CA, and this DVD kicks butt over the live concert experience!   <br />Put it in the player and turn up the volume...enjoy it and take it easy....
1593975635|1.0|This book is so riddled with inaccuracies and unrealistic that it was unreadable for me. I'm certainly no cryptography expert, but I've been developing software professionally for over 10 years. Spoiler warning, everything discussed below is revealed in the first (of 9) CDs, which is about as much as I could stand. <br /> <br />- In general, it seems that the author is trying to emulate Clancy when describing technologies, but they come off as a high-school sci-fi writing. For instance, the concept of any computer with three MILLION cpu's is breathless hyperbole. It reminds me of Carl Sagan's \\"Billions and Billions\\" catch-phrase, or for something more current, Dr. Evil's ransom of \\"One MILLION Dollars!\\". The description of the computer itself being five stories tall is straight out of the mainframe era of the 1970's too. <br /> <br />- Somehow the embedding of carbon fibers in a clear polycarbonate dome renders it resistant to a multi-megaton nuclear explosion. <br /> <br />- The description of public-key cryptography is wrong, possibly because it is completely glossed over, but why let facts get in the way of the plot.  <br /> <br />- The character development is right out of a first-year college course on fictional writing. The description of the Japanese \\"villan\\" is overly melodramatic, as he was born to a woman who died during childbirth and witnessed Hiroshima. Clearly with a background like that how could he not be justified in hating the US, yet we are to feel sympathy for him because he is disfigured? \\"He's bad, he's good, he's bad, he's good! I like him and hate him. Oh, I'm so conflicted!\\" Please.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for a REAL book on crypto, check out Neal Stephenson's book _Cryptonomicon_. It's not as easy a read but still approachable for non-techies, the characters are better developed, and a much better book overall.
B000AL730O|5.0|A rather bold statement I know but really, I've heard them all (disappointed by most) and Chaos and Creation is simply Paul McCartney's best solo record. I can't wait to see some of THESE songs performed live!!!    Many of the songs on this record will be considered McCartney classics real soon.  Jenny Wren, English Tea, How Kind Of You, Riding To Vanity Fair are highlights but the entire record is enjoyable. Great job Paul!!!
0307276902|3.0|I picked up this book because I saw my wife watching Oprah and everyone on the show was saying that it was an absolute must read, that they could not put the book down.  Although I did find that the book was extremely \\"real\\", I did have a problem with the attitude of the author throughout the book.  He comes across as very anti-authority, even when he is at death's door. That part of the book was hard for me to adjust to. <br /> <br />Overall, I think the book is worth reading.  It takes you into a world that few see and makes you aware of the desperate lives that addicts find themselves leading.  It doesn't pull any punches.  Don't look for a feel good story in this one.
B00005JNJV|4.0|I did like this Batman movie a lot! I now own all of them (except for the Adam West movie). But there are a few holes in the story that left me wondering. <br /> <br />In this first movie, Bruce's parents are killed by the Joker, that's why he wants Joker dead! But in this movie, they are killed by someone else completely. <br /> <br />The story keeps changing about how he fell into the bat cave as a boy. In one movie, he falls into the cave while running in angst over his parents death. In Batman Begins, Bruce falls into the bat cave while his parents are still living, and while he's playing around at Wayne Manor. <br /> <br />There were a few other things that led me to believe that keeping to the same storyline isn't that important to different directors. But overall, a good film to add to your Batman collection.
B0000584V3|2.0|Not as much variety in the songs as I would have liked.
B00005QIPH|5.0|First off you could probably go through this entire reviewing section on the strokes and all the five stars would say something along the lines of the strokes are gods or whatever, and if you read the bad ones they would either compare this to the velvet underground, talk about how great kurt cobain is, or try to convert you to the mtv/music corporation to infect us with terrible music idea. Whatever. In my own oppinion i like the strokes, i like the sound. The way that Julian Casablancas sings is amazing to me, it doesnt sound like some blink 182 song. Sure the guys are rich, so what, if you want to use that excuse for hating the strokes or that they have such great looks and date fashion models, go ahead, but i advise you the careful reader to listen before you buy and make your own decision on the strokes. whether you like it or not, dont buy this because somebody says its great, even if its me, or somebody says it ridiculously bad, just make up your own mind on the strokes.
B0009S3HI0|5.0|I've been waiting so long for this release. Finally we have all the videos in a crystal clear format that are official and not downloaded or burned. The videos are nice and have an epic, dark, moody and emotional atmoshere. I do wish that they had more behind the scenes kind of stuff and some live performances, but it's all good. <br /> The cd is great and has some real gems. The only song that kind of gets on my nerves is the Teenager song that has the singer from Idiot Pilot singing with Chino.Don't get me wrong, the guitar is nice and Chino is awesome but that guy from Idiot Pilot totally murders the song. It wouldn't be as bad if he hit the same notes as Chino did in the original version, but instead of singing the original way he sings higher and it just sounds strange. He's not a terrible singer, it's just that the notes are wrong and that's why it makes me cringe to listen to the Idiot Pilot singer on the track. <br /> Don't let that discourage you from purchasing though , because the cd really does contain some awesome songs. My favorites would have to be Simple Man, Change, Be Quite and Drive, If Only Tonight We could Sleep, Savory, and Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want. <br />  The cover of the Cure's \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\" is great and better than the original. It is a live version and still sounds great, but I really hope they record it in a studio and release it.I think it's that good of a version to do so.  <br />   I really respect the passion and emotion that is put into the Deftones music. Give this CD/DVD a chance, You will find that you have made the right choice.
B0002TRSO0|5.0|I have had this CD in constant play in my car and home for the last 6 months.  My sister got me hooked after hearing Ray Lamontagne at Bonaroo Festival in 2004.  I saw Ray play a small club in Indianapolis and I'm even more enamored with the music.  Its beautiful and I can't even begin to compare it to anything else I've heard.  Just buy it, you won't be sorry!
0307276902|2.0|I wouldn't have much of a problem with this book if James Frey hadn't rediculously presented it as non-fiction. How stupid does he think the average consumer is?? The blatent and absurd lies and ego-stroking in this book are an insult to his readers' intelligence.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I waited for this documentary in the same way that Joan Baez waited to hear Bob Dylan for the first time; the hype was too good to be true, she said, and so she went to see him only to find out it was as good as portrayed. That was my hope, that it would be as good as it was hyped to be, and I was not fully satisfied. <br /> <br />I was more than satisfied with Part One (late 1950's-63) - very little psycho-babble on his childhood; merely shots of his face as a kid fading into the music which influenced him. The arrangement of the old footage from Woody Guthrie to Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers(they even had the legendary John Jacob Niles!) was genuinely exciting; it was Dylan without warts (the guy stole 45 invaluable records from a generous folk music collector, justifying it by claiming to be a musical expeditionary, and with a straight face); and Dave van Ronk was a genuine character, stating that Dylan was comfortable with the Left, but not really a man of the Left. Yet the Left cottoned on to him, seeing him in terms of an activism which was not fully there (compared with Baez or the courageous Pete Seeger). This told me far more about the wish-fulfilment of the US Left in the early 60s than any other programme. The Dylan performances were gems. So - Part One was excellent, with the music and the historical contexzt reinforcing each other. <br /> <br />But - Part Two (1963-66) did not live up to my expectations. The great performances by Dylan were there - they even had the legendary British concert where someone called out 'Judas' as he began Like a Rolling Stone, leading him to spit back 'you're a liar' and to use the song like a gun against the critics in the crowd (they had been partly organised by the British Communist Party, who were angry at Dylan's withdrawal form political folk music). The historical context was there at the start, but then suddenly stopped. It became one-sided - a chronicle of his performances, at its best a recognition that Dylan's breath-control in the 1964-66 period was an expression of beat poetry set to electronic sound (Whitman and Ginsburg used breath as a more natural means of organising the poetic line than the artifical iambic pentameter).  <br />But the historical context was missing - what was Dylan's attitude to the Vietnam War? The angst in his music of 1964-66, looking for the desperate and desolate in an age of affluence, was to my mind a reflection of the angst troubling American society as the Great Society was being proclaimed.  <br />Worse, the musical context was missing. What about the Beatles, whose own music was transformed by Dylan, and who helped to transform Dylan (\\"that's nothing; it's just something I learned in England\\")? Dylan didn't stop listening to music in 63; he continued to evolve, and the musical influences on that evolution are missing here. So we are left with the performances, magical as they were. <br /> <br />So - Part Two was not excellent. It was merely very good.
0792837614|5.0|\\"West Side Story\\" remains one of the most powerful, compelling and exceptional musicals ever brought from the stage to the screen.  It has it all.....for starters, the music is great and stands the test of time.  It has beautiful love ballads (\\"Maria,\\"  \\"One Hand, One Heart,\\" \\"Somewhere\\"), star-crossed lovers (Maria, a young Puerto Rican girl, who has connections to the Sharks, a Puerto Rican gang and Tony, a young Polish boy, who has connections to the Jets, a Polish gang), fiery and passionate dance numbers (\\"America\\" is a wonderful example of the beautiful choreography, transferred directly from the stage to the screen, by the legendary, late, great Jerome Robbins) and a compelling message about the cautionary effects of hatred in the face of love.<br /><br />This film was definitely worthy of the ten Academy Awards in 1961 (one being for Best Supporting Actress, Rita Moreno--a historical night for Latina actresses).  I really feel this film is timeless in its universal story of love, tragedy and life.
0307276902|2.0|Frey is a good storyteller, and the first 150 pages are gripping, but after a while you get tired of his macho crap. For all his talk about the \\"shame\\" he dealt with caused by his abuse of drugs and alcohol he spends very little time on the details of his shameful acts as a substance abuser. What he does spend a lot of time on is how tough he is, how much pain he can withstand, how he can intimidate the hardest criminals in the treatment center, and on how he's not a whining, whimpering 12-step 'addict' like other people in the treatment center.<br /><br />This \\"memoir\\" always seems to make him the hero and any one who opposes him a wimpy, pathetic villian. It's hard to imagine all his conflicts were that black and white in terms of who was right and who was wrong.<br /><br />Lastly, his prose is irritating. He seems to think that repeating something 3 times is the secret of poetry so he does it all over the book. He tries to find symbolism in his description of the lake and fields around his treatment center, but it falls flat.<br /><br />As an artist he reminds me of Oliver Stone or Joe Eszterhas.
630522577X|5.0|\\"My Fair Lady\\" should be a part of anyone's movie collection for several reasons.  For starters, the plot, adapted from \\"Pygmalion,\\" written by the great author, George Bernard Shaw, is wonderfully engaging and truly timeless.  The notion that a man handpicks a street urchin of the street, only to mold her into a dignified lady provides an example of the tendency, on the part of human beings, to want to mold and perfect one another at any cost. This is a stark look at a part of this world that is made all too apparent in fashion magazines, relationships between men and women, and even in our own critical self perception.  What's more, this musical has a beautiful score, written by the team of Lerner & Loewe. Some of the most beautiful pieces from musical theatre are showcased here.  (\\"On the Street Where You Live,\\"  \\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly,\\" \\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,\\" among others)<br /><br />Although it saddens me that the magical, mesmerizing Julie Andrews (the original Eliza Doolittle), was not used in this film version of the stage musical, we must give Audrey Hepburn credit for her \\"loverly\\" interpretation of the role.  It is definitely a credit to the judgement and vision of director, George Cukor, the he chose to use Rex Harrison, who truly WAS Dr. Henry Higgins on the stage, and decided to keep in the movie, as well. The chemistry between Hepburn and Harrison is real and believeable, as the complexities of their relationship, as pupil and professor, carry into something of a more personal and (possibly) romantic nature.  This is, of course, left to the interpretation of the beholder.  Though, the legendary song, \\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,\\" crooned toward the end, by Higgins (Harrison) definitely insinuates that their relationship was more than just one of the an academic nature.<br /><br />This is a film that has stood the test of time, does not come off as dated, and is totally \\"loverly.\\"  Check it out!
0743201140|4.0|I liked this book. It will not solve all of your life's problems, or make you an instant success. But, it provides useful information  derived from polls, interviews and a lot of refining that helps you to realize that if you are to succeed, you need to do what you do best and \\"manage\\" your weaknesses. This can be accomplished through a solid staff that complement one another with their strengths. If it's not good for anything else, it sheds light on other peoples' tendencies and their root causes. I gave the book four instead of five stars because a few more \\"how should you use this everyday\\" examples would have been helpful. But, again, if you expect to get anything from the book, you should plan to work.
B000BCE918|5.0|\\"Jurassic Park\\" is one of the top 10 movies of all time on any sane list.  Steven Spielberg took filmmaking to a completely different level with this masterpiece. In compilation with the outstanding work of Stan Winston, and the wonderful music of John Williams, you can't take your eyes off of the screen.  Although Jurassic Park II and III aren't up to par of the first film, they provide good, edge-of-your-seat entertainment that will keep you watching them again and again.  It is good to see all three of these films put together in such a nice package.  My opinion as a DVD collector is that this is worth the upgrade.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm not american, but in the UK we hear a lot of politics raised in regards to the US. <br /> <br />The point of this album is about truth. Green Day as a band are telling YOU the buyer what they think. You may all have your low opinions, but those low rated opinions just make you part of everything they are against. <br /> <br />If you are one of those people then don't bother buying this. <br /> <br />The album is a well written story. Its slightly political yes. But i don't think you understand this album AT ALL if you don't rate it. If you are an average pop junkie and you enjoy songs about love then you might as well get off this page right now. <br /> <br />Green Day are the post punk of the younger generation. The inspire the kids and elders of today to express their opinions freely. <br /> <br />If you are an old Green Day fan like myself and have stuck by them, then the words \\"Sell out\\" pop up excessively. Excuse me if I'm wrong but if you started out where Billie, Mike and Tre did as young kids, trailed around the toilet circuit for 5 years trying to break through i think you'd take that wad of cash. Green Day ARE NOT YOUR BAND they are their own band and always have been and they would be considered stupid if they stuck by you old fashioned down and outs. Get over it because we no longer care what you think. <br /> <br />This is an album of progression, of a band that have grown and produced 9 albums of brilliance. If you are a new Green Day fan i can't garuntee you'll like them. This is an entirely new Green Day. And for those of you who don't know your facts and think they sold out because of this album, their so called selling out happened in 1994. <br /> <br />To those who love this album as much as i. I salute you. To those of you who do not like this album purely because its not your average so called pop, then thank you for expressing your opinion. And to those who think this album is pointing the finger at you for supporting your government, you are a true AMERICAN IDIOT.
B00004ZBVG|4.0|Gene Hackman is Lt. Colonel Iceal Hambleton.  In real life Lt. Col. Hambleton was flying as a navigator on an EB-66 electronic countermeasures plane, call sign Bat-21.  When a surface-to-air missile hits the plane, Col. Hambleton is the only man able to eject from the aircraft, landing in the northern portion of South Viet Nam.  For the next eleven and a half days Col. Hambleton evaded capture by the North Vietnamese Army until he was rescued in one of the largest and most complex rescue missions of the Viet Nam War.  These true events, for which 234 medals were awarded, inspired this movie.<br /><br />In the movie Col. Hambleton is nearing possible rescue by a Jolly Green Giant rescue helicopter when Viet Cong destroy the helicopter.  The Viet Cong, who are using the people of a nearby village to protect themselves from American attack since the Viet Cong know that Americans typically attempt to protect non-combatants, kill all the crew.  However, this time the rage of Col. George Walker (Jerry Reed, in one of his best roles) causes the village to be destroyed by napalm bombs.<br /><br />Col. Hambleton is on the run for his life, both from the North Vietnamese Army and from an impending air strike by B-52 bombers.  Using the call sign Bat-21 and his URC-64 survival radio, Hambleton follows directions from forward air controller Captain Bartholomew Clark along a path based on golf courses that Col. Hambleton has played.<br /><br />What I find amazing about this movie is that while there are events that illustrate the tragedy and inhumanity of the combat in Viet Nam, much of the movie focuses on the people in the movie.  There is a touching moment where Col. Hambleton passes a boy on a bridge, and the two exchange gifts, forgetting for a moment the ideologically generated conflict going on around them.  It is also apparent to me that Col. Hambleton had nothing against the Vietnamese people; he was just a soldier with a job to do.<br /><br />Movies typically do a poor job portraying any war or combat, with few exceptions.  Similarly, this movie misses much with respect to the true story.  This movie also invents things that never happened, or misrepresents other events, likely all for the sake of pace and action.  However, this movie does catch the spirit of one man surviving incredible odds in war to not only do his job, which was to fight an enemy, but to get himself rescued in the process.  From that viewpoint this movie is a winner.o a poor job portraying any war or combat, with few exceptions.  Similarly, this movie misses much with respect to the true story.

B0002JJBZE|5.0|Although I would never pay this kind of money, I have to <br />recognize the fabulous Star Trek, a show that was light years <br />ahead of the rest of T.V. in it's philosophy and moral vision. <br />Although it's all true about the special effects, costumes, and over-acting; this show had heart and soul and provided space fantasy, science (or the semblance of), and creativity for us trapped in the 4-5 channel world of tv existence in the mid-80s.  Long live the voyagers and seekers.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|** CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br />The following brief critique refers to the \\"Ultimate Director's Cut\\" edition of \\"The Warriors\\" dvd, released in Australia late October, 2005.  <br /> <br />Pros: <br />* Suburb sound (Dolby Digital 5.1) and picture quality (1.78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen) considering this film was released in 1979. <br /> <br />* Interesting new documentary split into 4 parts (each of approximately 15 minutes duration) includes Walter Hill, Michael Beck, David Patrick Kelly, James Remar and Deborah Van Valkenburgh. <br /> <br />Cons: <br />* Addition of comic-style frames and freezes slows the action, diluting the tension in parts, especially The Warriors' initial sighting of the Baseball Furies outside the subway.  I always liked the line at the end of the scene when Alax is captured in the park when a policeman says \\"Put that slime in the back\\" - this line is not in this version, overridden by a comic frame introducing the next scene.  Also the ending where The Warriors are walking along the beach has been cut drastically, instead opting for the comic frames with the closing credits.  I much preferred the long walk. <br /> <br />* No deleted scene of the original daytime Coney Island Boardwalk opening.  Whilst I certainly agree that the movie is more effective beginning at night, I was annoyed that there was reference to this original opening in the documentary but it was not included as a separate deleted scene.  I was under the impression that this would have been included.  A couple of people have criticized us \\"anal-retentive\\" fans to \\"get over it\\" but one must take into account just how much numerous people enjoy this movie.  If you are really into a particular movie, you are interested in any deleted / alternate scene, and to have that not included on the supposedly \\"Ultimate Director's Cut\\" was a real missed opportunity. <br /> <br />In summary, I would choose the traditional (non-director's cut) copy of the movie (sans Greek Mythology introduction and comic book frames) if I was introducing someone to this movie. <br /> <br />Thank you.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|... and then Spanish Bombs about made me cry and I immediately identified with Lost in the Supermarket.  Of course a lot of these songs were never much good (album #2 is largely a waste), but the overall effect of the album is larger than it's flaws.  A punk band with heart that made every outcast feel relevant and understood.  Oh, and of course told the system to go \\"bleep\\" themselves.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I actually just viewed this movie a couple of nights ago and was suprised that I actually enjoyed it. Dark and demented, this movie actaully plays on a scientific and psychological mind that is very unique. I have to say, I was not familiar with the \\"Butterfly Effect\\" Theory and background, but I decided to research the material and had fun doing it! So I learned something new and I watched a curious and great movie as well.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Exciter was a pretty 2.5 star album, but this one blows the doors off of that.  As others have mentioned, I don't think it's better than Violator by any means (their best, IMO), but this CD is great.  Depeche Mode has a knack for pulling off an aesthetic, and this CD has a good grasp of adding little touches that make even the least brilliant song shine a little brighter.  If you are a fan of the 80's DM, I recommend at least giving it a listen.
0156711427|3.0|I first read this book as a gauch 16 year old high school kid. This was a \\"must read\\" book for our Lit course in high school, and I remember that we had a hard time comprehending the contents of the book. All the nuances of the book were lost on us! We were puzzled on why Dr. Aziz was treated the way he was. We did not fully comprehend on  EM Forster approach to India, and the British in India. Forster liked to visit India if I recollect correctly. <br /> <br />A few years later, I watched the film, and many of the loose strands came together in my mind. Sometimes, a visual interpretation of a book helps, and it certainly did for me. But, my confusion never really went away because of the way in which the novel ended. It was left to the readers to decide what had happened to Miss Quested in the caves, and having Dr. Aziz along on the trip certainly did not help him. <br /> <br />This book might be a difficult read if the reader is not informed about India, and how the nature of the colonial rule went through some fundamental changes in the early 20th century.  <br /> <br />EM Forster writes well, and it might be worth reading because of that. Hopefully, you will not be confused like I was when I read the book. I have not had the heart to read the book again. One of these days I just might, and then maybe I shall post a revised review of the book.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|even anyone who hasn't ever heard of dylan or anyone who disregards his work and his music will be totally enchanted by this masterpiece. I highly recommended. I don't quite know anyone as fan of him as me, and after seeing this film, i still love him a thousand times more
B0007DAZW8|4.0|Depending on what mood your in, this album ranges from a 1 star to maybe a 4.5 on a very good day.    Is it repetitive? YES  Is it catchy? YES  Can you sing along? \\"Rock, Robot Rock\\"....of course you can  Driving music? Really depends on the driver  Club music? With the right mix, this stuff is intoxicatingly good    If you've heard Robot Rock (I think the best song on the album by far) then you know what your getting into. This song is like an 80s Miami cop drama intro on loop...but BETTER. I do, however, wish the guitars in that song were a little more prevalent on the rest of the album.    Conclusion: If you don't like electroclash/electronica (Fischerspooner, etc.) you probably won't like this. If you enjoy a catchy groove you can dance in your head to, this is an album you will enjoy.

B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against the Machine are now band of the past,but their mark on music still remains and might remain for a long while. One of only a hand full of bands in the nineties that were strictly about the music.  <br /> <br />  Where as other groups fuse the sound of  Metallica and the sad lyrical imitation of Tupac, Rage steps away from that crowd.  Rage chooses older bands like Led Zepplin, MC5 and the message of Public Enemy and the anger of N.W.A. <br /> <br />    All four members of Rage shine at what they do.  While I am no Mozart, it is obvious that each member is very talented.  The group chemistry is very strong as every song makes sense. Bombtrack lights the bomb and never looks back.  Every song is filled with emotion and energy.  Killing in the Name and Bullet in the Head are classics as well. Freedom is the best closer ever for me.  You may know Wake Up as the main song from the Matrix. <br /> <br />  This Rage album is like every other Rage album.  No trying something new, no trying to attract mainstream, nothing fake.  They made music that people either loved or hated.  This is complex like every album by Rage.  Once it makes sense, it is the closest thing to perfection you will hear. <br /> <br /> If you are looking to get into Rage, you should start with Battle of Los Angeles. If you want more Rage, this is the album you should buy second.  Rage is not for teenagers,not meaning that the music is too obsurd, but too complex for some young music lover that is into the hardest thing MTV gives them.  On your first listen, you may like 2 or 3 songs, but remember once it grows it just makes sense. <br /> <br /> Rage albums will only become more rare in the future.  You should definately get into this band.  If you love listening to music this band will turn your world upside down.  Lyrically, Musically in every way and form.

1573223085|4.0|Daniel Pink has an interesting view on globalisation where he argues that the world is moving from the Informational Age to the Conceptual Age. Abundance, Asia and Automation are identified as three forces that are changing the future.     The first force, `Abundance' refers to the state of our lives in developed countries and increasingly we want products or services that are aesthetically pleasing. The second force, `Asia' refers to outsourcing. The third force, `Automation' is self-explanatory. Pink reasons that if we are not creating aesthetically pleasing outcomes (experience, service or products) at work, or if our jobs can be outsourced or automated then we are in danger of being redundant.     But fret not, as Pink also states the six skills or abilities that will help us thrive in this New Economy and the six antidotes are as follows:    a) Design: This is related to the factor of abundance hence, design is a skill that is vital to produce experiences, products or services that appeal to the consumers' senses. For example, even government housing (in Singapore, at least, called HDB flats ) nowadays are being designed to please our senses and it is not merely functional blocks that serve as shelters.        b) Story: Increasingly, it is being seen that stories are being used by companies and individuals for purposes of selling, inspiring, communicating and persuading. Pink gives a number of tips to improve our story-telling and states `mini sagas' as one of the way by which our story-telling skills can be honed.        c) Symphony: The ability to see the big picture and put the disparate pieces together.      d) Empathy: The ability to understand other people and their feelings. Not sympathy but empathy.     e) Play: This is a skill of understanding games, humour and laughter. It helps us balance our lives. Remember, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.       f) Meaning: The search for meaning or purpose of life through spirituality, charity or othermeans. This is a vital element that is possibly the most important among the six to live a meaningful life in this day and age.       Remember, 9 is the magical number to thrive in today's environment i.e. awareness of the 3 forces and the mastery of 6 skills.
B00004Z459|5.0|I happened to love this CD.  I know that Linkin Park has been bashed as crap nu-rock dispite their MASSIVE following.  I really have the Lamb of God lovers who have to review bands that DON'T FALL INTO THAT CATAGORY and piss and moan about how these bands aren't hard enough.  The fact remains that if you can't appreciate anything but one style of music then your dence and need to expand your narrow mind!!!  I happen to love Lamb of God or Demon Hunter and bands alike.  I also like Linkin Park, Staind and Disturbed.  I also listen to Lil Kim, Eminem and Snoop Dogg, Ashanti, Justin Timberlake and even the ocational Tim McGraw.  You have to be able to listen to a balance of music to truly appreciate what everyone brings to the table.  Linkin Park brings quite a bit. <br /> <br />1: Papercut: This is a great start.  The rap in this CD is not to overboard like Limp Bizkit...it fits perfect and doesn't feel out of place. <br /> <br />2: One Step Closer: First single and still just as good as when I first heard it.  The riffs are great and even though the video was weird, it was still pretty neat... <br /> <br />3: With You: LOVED this song when it came out, but if you want a treat, the version on reanimation is ever better <br /> <br />4: Points of Authority: Worst on the CD...I skip it... <br /> <br />5: Crawling: The best on the CD by far.  Video was freaking amazing and the lyrics are really haunting if you think about it. <br /> <br />6: Runaway: I liked this song alot.  Great intencity. <br /> <br />7: By Myself: Similiar to With You, just not as good. <br /> <br />8: In the End: This song is good, just not as great as everyone makes it out to be...it gets old after a while <br /> <br />9: A Place For My Head: If it weren't for the video for Crawling I may like this song better.  it was the first song that I downloaded by this band and it was the song that made me run out and by the album. <br /> <br />10: Forgotten: Decent <br /> <br />11: Cure for the Itch: DJ workhere...good, but session on meteora is better <br /> <br />12: Pushing Me Away: AWSOME closer here...great breakup song...worth every penny right here... <br /> <br />Linkin Park came onto the scene full steam ahead and proved they had what it takes to stay for a long time, blowing acts like Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach out of the water.  Thank god fort he later (papa roach) they redeemed themselves by setting the rap/rock image aside and settling on standard rock/nu-metal and with their latest release \\"getting away with murder\\" proved they are a force to reckon with... <br />
0393327655|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Not only was this a very interesting book, well researched, and at times horrifing, it spoke to me the way only a philosopher can.  After enduring years of PC bullsh#t at universities Sam Harris cuts through to the trouble with the Abrahamic religions (none of my professors could) and why 'Faith' kills.  Sam Harris has turned the field of philosophy, what was for me dead letter into vibrant postmodern philosophy and a new look at spritual life.  I can't recommend this book enough.
B000AARKOO|4.0|This movie, unduly BASHED by critics, was not half bad.  I enjoyed the storyline, and the acting as a whole was decent.  The battle scenes as well as the scenery itself was breathtaking and even rivaled those in Troy.  I have to say, to me the strongest charactor was Marton Csokas who played husband to Eva Green (who also did a great job with what she had to work with) and subsiquential heir to the throne.  Orlando Bloom who I will say is a fine actor handled his role well, or as well as can be expected.  Although I feel that Colin Farrell did a far better job in Alexander (my opinion) I was surprised to see him buff out for his role here.  He's got nothing on Crowe, Bana or Pitt for that matter but he did decent.  Edward Norton as the leper king was a treat...he's a great actor who can tackle anything spendidly.  It's a story to be told and thats a great thing.  I love epic pictures and this is one I will watch again and one that I am happy was made.  It's not like it couldn't have been better, but the point is that it's still really well done.  Just because he's no Crowe doesn't mean he's not good.
0385338686|2.0|Never having read a Sophie Kinsella book before, I delved into this one with much anticipation.  What a disappointment!  It started off promising enough.  Samantha was a fairly accurate portrayal of many working women today, although I do know a fair number of  women who seem to manage just fine in regard to having a personal life.  However, once Samantha becomes a housekeeper, it's all downhill from there.  I know  the reader needs to suspend disbelief when reading most fiction, but you would have to be incredibly gullible to buy any of this.  Where to start.  Samantha can't even do the most basic of cooking, and yet she is making gourmet meals and cooking for charity lunches within a month or two, all with skills that were learned on the weekends only, no less!  She also falls madly in love with Nathaniel, for no other reason than that he is there.  At the end, the book really falls apart - when offered a choice between her old life and new life, it's so black and white.  A woman who is a top legal mind, and yet she never thinks to ask about flex time, or work out some other sort of arrangement?  If that were true there wouldn't be a married lawyer in the world.  The final nail in the coffin for this book was the whole media fiasco.  Page after page of reporters following around a character who isn't the least bit interesting.  It rates up there as one of the most disappointing endings ever.   <br />
B00004RFFS|5.0|I have never watched a film so beautiful, so in- depth, and so mature on vampires. Anne Rice did a great job on picking the right people to make this film. And unlike the film version of Queen of the Damned, a very disgrace to the Chronicles it came from, Interview was very faithful to the story Anne wrote a long time ago. A thing or two was changed, but nothing that affected the movie from it's original storyline.  <br />The actors were amazingly strong and believable and I don't care what anyone says Tom Cruise was the greatest as Lestat. That guy on Damned didn't even take the time to color his hair blonde, for he refused to even look the part of Lestat, while Tom Cruise did everything he could to act and look like him and Tom Cruise poured on Lestat's charm while the guy on Damned was dull and wooden. Tom Cruise did a great job on Lestat, Anne Rice even said so. Brad Pitt was fantastic as Louis and so miserable, exactly like Louis. Armand was played beautifully in Antonio Banderas and yes he was older than Armand actually is but everyone has to admit Antonio did a great job playing the seductive and manipulative Armand. Kirsten Dunst...wow was she a strong character for someone so young. I thought she would hardly be anything, yet as a child she was strong in this film surprisingly. She played Claudia flawlessly. Rea only had a short time in Interview but indeed he stood out as a great actor and of course Slater as the ever curious boy taping the entire story of Louis' held good ground.  <br />Aside from the actors who all did a superb job there was the excellent job on scene and costume and music. All of this was done very well and made this one unforgettable film. The one thing I love about this film though is how it respected the work of Anne Rice's and obviously worked hard to put it in the right mood and put the right actors in to protray the certain personalities. I really respect everyone for doing that, for Interview is a great story that deserved a great film. Anne Rice said she wept when she saw the film, and I didn't weep but I certainly am moved by it. It's my favorite vampire film, and none other has matched up to it for me.  <br /> <br />You want cheesy teen fluff you watch Queen of the Damned, but if you want a serious, moving and grown- up look at vampires this is your movie: Interview with the Vampire. It's about a vampire who tells a human a story, about his own life, right at the time when he was born into his life as a vampire. The rest of the film is a rollarcoaster of the vampire's ups and downs and the interesting people he meets along the way with his never ending question: What is the meaning of it all? Sit back and watch a truly amazing tale; if there are vampires, this I believe would be the reality of their lives.

B000002IKR|5.0|Testament are fairly successful, but not as successful as bands like Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, or Slayer. This is really unfair, because, even though Metallica paved the way/opened the floodgates for many thrash bands in the 1980's (and Testament were inspired by Metallica), they weren't just another copycat. Testament's music was much more commercially accessible most other thrash that debuted in the `80's (especially Slayer's \\"Show No Mercy\\"). This is partially due to the band's un-Satanic lyrics. Also, the vocals are usually on the somewhat melodic side. Unlike Tom Araya, Chuck isn't screaming as fast and loud as possible; he goes at his own pace (plus, songs like \\"Alone In The Dark\\" even have somewhat melodic vocals.) .<br /><br />Testament's first album, 1987's \\"The Legacy,\\" is largely considered the group's best effort. This is mostly due to axeman Alex Skolnick's blistering riffs, powerful leads, wailing solos, and all around great guitar work. \\"Over The Wall\\" and \\"The Haunting\\" both have two amazing guitar solos which have several parts to them, and \\"Apocalyptic City\\" features arguably Alex's best solo. Elsewhere, \\"Raging Waters\\" has a propulsive rhythm which is powered by fast, cascading riffs; \\"C.O.T.L.O.D.\\" shoots by with scorching, almost machine gun guitar work; and \\"Do Or Die\\" is so fast, the riffs almost sound like a buzzsaw.<br /><br />It may not be as great (or groundbreaking) as, say, \\"Master of Puppets,\\" but when all is said and done, \\"The Legacy\\" is a great and important chapter in the history of thrash. A must for metalheads.
