B007SYWFRM|5.0|for me this game is a little additive. it is really fun and the graphics are cool. love the cartoon with Scrat and the Ninja Scrat game... really fun....
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I just don't get it. The free version is just like the paid one!!!! Except the paid one has no ads.... so who cares?!?! I recommend just getting the free version.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|This is a must have if you are into special effects and you love blu-rays. It's nice to add to my collection along with the 20th anniversary edition original which I have. It's cheaper and easier to find now that the sequel is out. I got the blu-ray/dvd combo set.
B005P59ANS|1.0|The claims are WRONG, this product leaked from just wading in the water. Now i need to buy a whole new iphone! Their warranty only covers their product but wont buy me a replacement iphone. I also had to invest in several charging jack extenders and 3.5mm audio extenders that would fit in this case because the plugs are so recessed.
0439023521|5.0|The product arrived quickly at minimal cost. The novel is excellent. My students fight over it. I suspect I will now need to be the rest of the trilogy.
B00786XVOG|5.0|What can I say, I just love Yanni. His music, his arrangements, the awesome variety of instruments he uses in those arrangements, and in every performance (well on his DVD concerts, anyway) the talent playing those instruments is unbeatable. The productions, in exotic sites and in front of such different national audiences, are half the experience, and a great reason to get his concert DVDs! Watching is almost as much a treat as listening. And this DVD is classic, pure pleasure and fun. I am so glad I got it!
B0000691U1|5.0|The Remastering and Mixing from the 3 track master is noting  short of  Spectacular.  The sound stage is both deep and holographic.  There is nothing bad to be said about the quality of this recording or the music itself.<br />Contrary to Mr 1 Star.  Even the cover screams BUY ME!!

B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I had read this mega-bestseller when it was first published and was among the legion of fans who then rushed to see it made into a movie, hoping it would translate adequately.  Well, as everyone including Mario Puzo now knows, it did that and more: the movie eclipsed the novel and become for many the best American film ever made.  Its images are so iconic that one can hardly imagine a different Don Corleone than Marlon Brando or, indeed, any of the rest of its superb cast.  So it was with a certain expectation of disappointment that I decided to return to the written page and see how well it met the exceedingly high standards of the film.<br /><br />Somewhat to my surprise, I was glad I did it.  The movie still occupies my mind's eye and is something I will watch over and over.  But the book also is well worth reading, or rereading.  I admit that I tired of reading about the \\"Cupid bowed\\" mouths and faces of Puzo's gangsters, and a few of the characters are not exactly as remembered.  Fredo, in particular, is a more physical type whose breakdown in the face of his father's presumed assassination is supposedly made thereby all the more striking.  Those are minor things.  Enjoyably, there are many more details about virtually all the characters.  Lucy Mancini (the bridesmaid who memorably trysts with Sonny at Connie's wedding) is a far more important figure, as is her Las Vegas boyfriend, Dr. Kennedy, who was written out of the movie altogether.  We know much more about Johny Fontane and his pal Nino; more about the background of Luca Brazzi; and even about Paulie Gatto, the Don's driver who helped set up the hit by calling in sick.<br /><br />This is a book I might not have returned to in pre-Kindle days.  I am very glad I did.
145162445X|5.0|It is not everyday you can pick up a book that was composed by a physicist and be excited, intrigued, and entertained. Lawrence has done this in some of his previous books however he hit a home-run with this book.<br /><br />The question of \\"How do we get an astounding universe from nothing?\\" finally has an answer, a reference to turn to.<br /><br />Even if you aren't a science buff or religious debater you will enjoy this book just for the fact, \\"where did we come from?\\" and \\"what caused the beginning of the universe?\\" are questions every intelligent human asks their self and now we have some start to finding these answers.<br /><br />My sincere thank you to Dr. Krauss for this book.

0345803485|1.0|I am writing this review whilst biting my lip. I do hope Mr. Grey doesn't catch me.<br /><br />I hate to come on here and be so negative, but surely I am not the first among the 2,700+ reviews and imagine I won't be the last. I purchased this book due to its rather high placement on the Amazon bestselling book list. I did option to \\"look inside this book\\" before buying it, so seeing the dialogue, why did I still buy it? I'm not sure. Curiosity, I imagine.<br /><br />The \\"erotic\\" S&M theme might surprise the more reserved reader, which I suspect is part of the reason this book had so much buzz about it. Sadly, it is so poorly written that no amount of shock value (although to me, an avid reader, there was nothing that took me aback) could save it.<br /><br />Anastasia 'Ana' Steele is a childish, naive, way-too-innocent college student. At the age of 21 and still a virgin, she is inexperienced in the ways of love and relationships. This is evident by the way the author has her speak (and lots of thinking to herself). It's not so much Ana's naive nature that I have a problem with... it's her stupidity and child-like ways. If I had a dollar for every \\"Holy Cow\\", \\"Holy Crap\\", \\"Oh, My\\", \\"Oh, boy\\", \\"Oh, No\\", I'd be richer than Christian Grey. The first time she sees him naked in front of her (she'd never seen a naked man before), she thinks to herself \\"Holy Cow\\". WTF? Who does that?<br /><br />As the book plods along like a drugged elephant running down the street, Ana's vocabulary doesn't improve at all. She is still stuck with the mindset of a twelve year old. For example, even after she's had numerous sexual encounters with Grey, she speaks about him like an avid teenage fan who finally got the chance to be with her celebrity crush (\\"I am naked in a bathtub with Christian Grey. He's naked\\"). Mature women in mature, adult sexual relationships don't behave like that. After a while the juvenile thinking and speaking grates on your very last nerve and you really don't care one way or another what happens to her. If she's too naive and stupid to act like an adult, she loses her likeability. And if you don't like the lead character in a book, generally there's nothing left.<br /><br />Christian Grey may have been a better character if the writer had any real skill. Sadly, he was a bundle of contradiction, arrogance, confusion and all he ever did was \\"frown\\" about something. In fact, the majority of the characters in this book frowned every minute or two. It was like their default facial expression. I guess they are as unahppy with the subject matter as I, the reader, was every moment I spent reading this silly thing.<br /><br />That being said, I think I'm going to stick with my old standby mystery/thriller writers... Harlan Coben, Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Andrew Gross, Lisa Unger, just to name but a few. I always know what I'm getting there, and that is interesting adult content.one way or another what happens to her. If she's too naive and stupid to act like an adult, she loses her likeability.

0553573411|4.0|This book is the second installment of The Farseer trilogy, which begins with [[ASIN:055357339X Assassin's Apprentice (The Farseer Trilogy, Book 1)]]. This review does not contain (significant) spoilers for Royal Assassin, although the events of Assassin's Apprentice are discussed here.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />My reaction to Assassin's Apprentice was confusion. I wasn't quite sure what I read, because it was a fairly erratic. Perhaps intentionally, the tone of the book shifted around many times. This was perhaps because we were seeing the world through the eyes of a young character, and his perceptions change drastically as time passes.<br /><br />Luckily, Royal Assassin is more stable in tone. Hobb also breaks off her tumultuous love affair with her thesaurus, much to the improvement of the book. While Assassin's Apprentice had a nonstop barrage of extremely obscure words used, apparently, just for the sake of having obscure words, Royal Assassin does not suffer from this problem.<br /><br />Likewise, Assassin's Apprentice had issues finding its plot. Really, it served as a prologue for the series and little more. Royal Assassin focuses in more detail on what seems to be the true heart of the story: the Red-Ships and the power struggle between Prince Verity and Prince Regal. To be frank, more things happen in this book, and that is a good thing.<br /><br />The strong points of Assassin's Apprentice are kept in this book. The magic system is still quite interesting, and in this book we hear more about the Wit and less about the Skill. The world is still compelling, and the heightened focus on the Red-Ship plot line makes it even more gripping. The characters are still well fleshed out and compelling.<br /><br />The Neutral:<br /><br />The first third to half of Royal Assassin seems like it is just a meditation on honor, sacrifice, and duty. Almost every single important character in the book gives something major up for the sake of a greater good. Literallythe only main character who does not do this is the primary antagonist of the book.<br /><br />Other reviews have talked about how the main character in this book is powerless, cowardly or indecisive. I disagree with that interpretation. Instead, I feel like that is an element of the theme of sacrifice in this book: Fitz sacrifices his autonomy in service to his king. He certainly could use his assassin training to go on a poisoning spree and stand up for himself, but to do so would be a betrayal of everything he swore in the first book. Instead, he simply accepts that he is honor-bound to live his life however he is commanded, regardless of how he feels about the commands.<br /><br />If that sounds like a horrible protagonist to you, then you're going to have a bad time reading this book. However, once I realized what was happening, I appreciated the inherent conflict it presented.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />There are conflicts between Royal Assassin and Assassin's Apprentice. I'm not sure if I would call them continuity errors, but there were several points in Royal Assassin that seemed to slightly retcon the previous book. Overall, I was left with the impression that the last chapter of Apprentice was added at the insistence of the editor or publisher to give it a more satisfying ending, and Royal just ignores everything that happens in that chapter.<br /><br />The ending, which I will not spoil, is anti-climactic to say the least. I won't discuss this in detail because it would require spoiling things, but suffice to say that the end of this book would give Neal Stephenson's early work a run for its money in terms of stories that just randomly stop. It's the middle book in a trilogy, so that is to be expected to some extent. It just seems like in this book, the ONLY significant events that happen at the end are to set up the plot of the next book.<br /><br />Finally, and this is a matter of personal preference, I did not find the romance subplot of this bookenjoyable. Again, I don't want to spoil anything, just suffice it to say that I found it more annoying than anything.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Royal Assassin is, to me, a vast improvement over the first book of the series. It has all of the charm that kept me reading the first book, and did away with many of the things I found annoying. It has flaws of its own, but it's still a solid step up.<br /><br />Like the first book, it was compelling enough that I continually forced myself to make time for reading more of it. At the end of the day, that is more telling than any analysis I could perform about the merits of the writing or the story. I would recommend this to anyone who isn't completely put off by my caveats and complaints in this review. Hobb's work is definitely not for everyone, but I found it enjoyable.
B001L4NJIO|2.0|Holy excessive over the top loudness! This thing isn't turned up to 11....more like 15!? WTF?! Another case of an audio engineer that shouldn't have a job doing it. The Dolby True HD 5.1 mix is so hot that even on a good quality reference system it's hard to get it under control. I thought my subs were going to implode when it first came on. Other good quality Blu Rays get to -15db or so when I really want to crank them up. This is hard to push past -30db with out thinking I'd be doing serious damage to my system. The 5.1 mix is pretty lame too. Not much at all going on in the surrounds. Picture quality is great. Though some times there tends to be a bit too much cut / pan.<br /><br />As for the show, if you're a Police fan then you will enjoy it a lot. They preform a whole bunch of classics and even change them up enough to make them fresh. It's good to see them all together again as it will probably be the last time. So from a document / nostalgic stand point this blu ray is great. The performances themselves are pretty good. Though I've always appreciated Andy Summers solo stuff better. Sting is...well...a mediocre bass player but his voice is great here. Stewart Copeland is by far the highlight of the three. An outstanding drummer that gets no where near the recognition he deserves.<br /><br />If you find this cheap. Buy it for the reunion alone. If you want a good sounding reference Blu ray...look elsewhere.

B000NMY7CM|3.0|Good film! Sandra Bullock did an amazing job at one of her earlier films as an actress. 28 Days\\" is one of the most accurate movies about alcoholism and drug addiction I can remember. The film does not glamorize or poke fun at its thematic content, but instead shimmers in truth depicting the problems in which a nowhere life can lead.This movie teaches us lessons through its characters. And the lessons are well taught. Recommended to all.<br /><br />After getting into a car accident while drunk on the day of her sister's wedding, Gwen Cummings is given a choice between prison or a rehab center. She chooses rehab, but is extremely resistant to taking part in any of the treatment programs they have to offer, refusing to admit that she has an alcohol addiction. After getting to know some of the other patients, Gwen gradually begins to re-examine her life and see that she does, in fact, have a serious problem. The path to recovery will not be easy, and success will not be guaranteed or even likely, but she is now willing to give it a try.

B000002NJS|4.0|I'm not a big fan of Madonna's music as I once was but Ray of Light remains my favorite album she has put out. A lot of the credit goes to producer William Orbit who provides a killer sonic background to her lyrics. I think it is Madonna's most mature effort she has put out and it shows in her lyrics. I like how subtle the dance beats are and how they allow Madonna's vocals to be front and center. The ballads on this album are the best that Madonna has ever done especially \\"The Power of Goodbye\\", \\"Frozen\\", and \\"Skin\\". Ray of Light is not a perfect album.There were a few tracks that I didn't care for but most of the album I love.

0451232577|3.0|OK, I admit it, I keep buying these huge Follett doorstops.  If this is book one of three....<br />Now for my rating system.  It took a long time for me to read this book as I put it next to my bed.  I'd read some before I went to sleep and if I woke up, read a little more.  Some nights, several pages, other night; several sentences.<br />I never took this book out of the bedroom which says a couple of things:<br />1.  It was interesting enough to keep me going until I finished it.<br />2.  It wasn't good enough to make it to living room or my chair on the porch.<br />In other words, I liked it but not enough to make it something I had to finish right away.
0345472322|5.0|I get frustrated when people divide the world into the talented and untalented. Life is too short to wait around to be noticed by imagined talent scouts. When people assert their fixed-mindset at me, I used to have trouble coming up with a polite response. And I didn't want to be rude so I would bite my tongue and suppress an eye-roll. Now, I will just tell people to read this book.<br /><br />The action step is simple: instead of comparing yourself to superstars and feeling bad, compare yourself to yesterday and feel good if you are a millimeter ahead. You can feel good about that every day. Why not? It's free. It has no calories. And those stars aren't happy anyway; if you don't believe it, read biographies.<br /><br />Mindsets hard to change because they're not conscious. You don't know you have a mindset until you know there's an alternative. Then you are free to choose, but life is so much more pleasant with the growth mindset. This book helps to make the alternative clear enough for your unconscious to absorb. I found it very uplifting. Anyone interested in the growth road might also like my book, [[ASIN:1463790929 Meet Your Happy Chemicals: Dopamine, Endorphin, Oxytocin, Serotonin]]

B00782O7NE|1.0|After all of the hype for this film, before the academy awards, I was very disappointed. When movie makers produced black and white films early on they painstakingly considered the light and gradients of white, gray going into black, working with the lighting techniques. This made scenes more intense and created the mood of the movie. I did not find this to be true in this \\"The Artist\\". The movie was in black, gray and white. The characters in the story were very shallow so why was this even considered best actor material? It was no stretch for veteran actors. Movies like \\"War Horse\\", \\"The Descendants\\", \\"Hugo\\" and \\"Midnight In Paris\\" were far superior in cinema photography, story and acting. Every once in a while Hollywood goes crazy and latches on to something different and unexpected and they did it again at the expense of the four dynamic previously mentioned films.

B00013RC66|4.0|This film has not made it to Blu ray as of this writing, but I was anxious to see it again.  My only copy is on the nearly extinct laserdisc so I decided to rent the DVD.  This isn't the only movie or character with the black widow in the title.  There is one from 1954 that has nothing to do with this iteration.  There's even the most recent Black Widow character in the new \\"Avengers\\" film.  That character, played by Scarlet Johansson does have something in common with this film's invented name.  Here she is played by Theresa Russell.  What do they have in common?  They are both beautiful and are very good actors.<br /><br />In 1987 Debra Winger was the superstar however and plays a geeky FBI agent who works in a building with green windows.  Alexandra (Winger) stumbles upon a series of mysterious deaths involving wealthy men dying in their sleep.  With help from a flirtatious co-worker and an ancient IBM computer she draws a bead on the widow played by Russell.  She uses numerous names but for now we'll use her last alias, Catharine.  Alex gets the OK from her boss (Terry O'Quinn) to do some field work.  This leads her to Hawaii where Catharine has taken up with her next victim, Paul (miscast Sami Frey) a hotel baron in the state.<br /><br />Alex and Catharine meet and become friendly although Alex is ultimately trying to save Paul who she has quickly fallen for.  If you're seeing this for the first time you might think Alex and Catharine might be right for each other.  I would have liked for the plot to follow that interesting twist, but another turns the film in the direction of the more traditional.  Director Bob Rafelson gets some excellent performances from Winger and Russell and a few of his usual tribe (Dennis Hopper, Lois Smith, and Diane Ladd) but almost blows it with Sami Frey who is a real dud as Paul.  I don't know if it is his French accent, his mannerisms or just his acting style but he isn't very convincing and certainly develops no chemistry with either actress.  I will admit this is certainly a sexy guilty pleasure and yet a worthy, if imperfect, member of the genre.ther actress.

3551354014|5.0|I am learning German and bought this on a whim.  I like it.  It seems to be a good contemporary idiomatic translation of Rowling's text.  For my purposes, the emphasis is on idiomatic and so I find it necessary to have Rowling's original at hand.<br /><br />On further consideraton, perhaps I should have used the word \\"register\\" rather than \\"idiomatic.\\"  All languages have registers and as a native English speaker my own translations from German to English always seem to have a poetic and archaic register.  Klaus Fritz's translation of J.K. Rowling is a very good translation of the original and everybody seems to agree the register rings true to contemporary native German speakers.  There is really no higher praise for any translation.
0345803485|2.0|I purchased this novel because I'm always interested in best sellers. I debated whether to give it two or three stars, but decided it's definitely below average. It's pornography, pure and simple - soft-porn, but gratuitous sex. The strange thing is that it isn't sexy or arousing, or it wasn't for this male. I tried to analyse why, because there are numerous sex scenes, most of them graphic. I decided that one reason is that the characters are so one dimensional and not really believable.<br /><br />It's quite difficult to write about sex - speaking as a novelist. I have a book about the subject - not sex, but writing about sex - which is illuminating. It's perhaps even more difficult when writing in the first person, because the reader has to believe in the character.<br /><br />This book somehow misses the mark, and scenes that ought to be exciting or titillating become rather tedious. There's a lot of repitition as well, including some unlikely expletives that I've never heard. It gives the impression of having been written by a high-school student who has researched bondage and stuff on the Internet - I know that isn't the case, but that's the standard of writing.<br /><br />It's really a sad reflection on the taste of our readers that they buy books like this, to the degree that they generate equally trashy sequels (judging from the reviews). As they say, there's no accounting for tastes. 'Twas ever thus.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|I've been a fan of Star Trek for decades;  I expected to be disappointed by a pre-quel. Instead, I loved it.  Completely captivating.
0756405890|5.0|So good it's hard to know where to start.<br /><br />By luck, my sister-in-law, who knew I'd just come off of the Song of Fire and Ice series asked if I'd heard of Patrick Rothfuss. The short story is she claimed he was as good, if not better than George R.R. Martain. The hell you say! I'm listening...<br /><br />What do I think? Is it true? Is Rothfuss better than Martain? How can I say. What I do know is that Rothfuss is an exceptional story teller, and unlike Martain, Rothfuss doesn't attempt a story on multiple fronts. Maybe this is why, if I need to compare, I prefer Rothfuss. A single setting in first person is an intense undertaking.<br /><br />Partick Rothfuss' Kvothe is one of the most compelling characters I've met in years. He is brilliant, but when we meet him, he is a child, and as a child he makes profound mistakes. We agonize for young Kvothe as we watch him struggle, sometimes for his very life. He is innocent, as children are, and in that way he is take advantage of. But young Kvothe grows, and with age comes wisdom, if we have the wherewithal to heed caution. Unfortunately, Kvothe is often reckless as teenagers are. Again, part of our love for him comes from his imperfection. He is human, and Rothfuss never let's us forget it.<br /><br />In addition to a hero worth adoring, Rothfuss has built a story that bends and sways. It is an unpredictable story, which makes it all the more real. Characters act the way that real people behave, which is vital in fantasy, as the world in which the characters inhabit is only slightly familiar to the reader.<br /><br />The language alone is reason enough to read this book. Line upon line will lift any poet or story teller's heart. You know you're in for a treat when the prologue's title is Silence in Three Parts.<br /><br />If you love fantasy, I highly suggest you pick this one up.<br />flag

B0080N6AVC|4.0|Supernatural is moving toward the conclusion of Season 7 and the defeat of the Leviathon. In this episode, the tablet that Sam and Dean found last week turns out to be the writings of Metatron, an in case of emergency note, as the newly awakened prophet, Kevin Tran, informs Sam and Dean. Poor Kevin, he is an honor student preparing his college applications and obsessing over his SAT scores when the latent prophet within him is awoken by Sam and Dean. It seems that Castiel is awakened by the tablet too as are various angels, demons and leviathon.<br /><br />The episode sets up the ultimate defeat of the leviathon and telegraphs a possible way in which Bobby will play his part. The leviathon storyline has been mishandled in many ways, set up as an invincible enemy and then left to sit for weeks at a time narratively speaking and then the means of defeat fall into their hands. Even the cliffhanger that ends the episode leaves the viewer a little unmoved. I am a long-time Supernatural fan and am quite forgiving but can only rate this episode as fair to good. I did like the character of Kevin but feel that introducing him earlier and having him and the boys work harder to discover the means of defeating the Leviathon might have made for better story-telling rather than giving it in a few wrap-up episodes. Required viewing for fans of the show but adjusted expectations are key.

0451457994|5.0|2001, in both film and book form, has had a profound impact on our culture. It has helped shape our relationship with technology, our search for other life forms, and our views on our evolution.<br /><br />The story of where we came from dovetails nicely here with the story of where we're going. In between is the story of HAL, both a cautionary tale about our reliance on technology and an exploration into what it means to be human.<br /><br />The story of humanity's origin gets a thoughtful treatment here as the notion that maybe homo sapien, a pathetic species which is poorly equipped for survival, got some outside help to not only survive, but thrive. That thread comes full circle at the end when the beings who provided that assistance again provide a boost to launch mankind to a new level of existence, one unhindered by the limitations of a mortal coil.<br /><br />As compelling and influential as these plot lines are, it's HAL's story that has served as a touchstone of our culture. His designers strive to make him human and that means building in frailty. Does that mean he thinks? Does he feel? He is capable of experiencing guilt, insecurity, and fear as part of the effort to match the human ideal. But it is these very characteristics that lead to tragic consequences. This poses important questions about what kind of reliance we should have on technology. It serves us, but what is the risk of that reliance?<br /><br />Since the movie is so widely known, someone considering reading this probably wants to know if the book fills in any gaps in the visually oriented but enigmatic film. The answer is \\"yes\\". The narrative voice and the inner voices of the characters fill in much that is left unexplained in the movie. Even the star gate sequence at the end is relatively clearly explained.<br /><br />The book was written at the same time as the screenplay, but differs on some points, usually for technical reasons. Kubrick was unable to create a convincing model of Saturn, so the voyage in the movie goes to Jupiter instead of Saturn, as it does in the book. The monolith at the beginning is clear in the book, but that proved difficult to film, so Kubrick made it black. Other differences are harder to explain. For example, in the book Floyd is a single father.<br /><br />2001, by almost any measure has had an enormous influence on our culture. The film pushed back the boundaries of what we can expect from visual entertainment. But the story is no less influential, providing an important backdrop to the driving force behind our civilization for the past forty years. The technology that fuels our culture and our relationship with it has been profoundly influenced by 2001. As such, it is important to understand 2001 to understand our modern world.

1439152799|3.0|I loved Kate Morton's first two novels and was very keen to read her latest offering \\"The Distant Hours\\".<br /><br />So it is with a tinge of disappointment in reviewing this one that I have to report that her plot and characters just didn't get me in this time. The plot was way way way too simliar to what she has done before and I found the character of Edie in particular very hard to like. The lushness of the settings, along with the suspense and intrigue, that Morton has created before just wasn't there.<br /><br />Maybe it's time for something new.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a novel set in the future. In this book, the goverment has a capital city and controls 12 districts. The author gives a good discription of how awful life in the districts, becuase of the capital, are. To make sure they stay under control, the capital takes two tributes, girl and boy, once a year to play in the annual Hunger Games. This is a fight to the death with only one winner.  Since it life or death, there is violence and killing. The chilren are put in an area and expected to kill. Even if they win twenty three other people have to die. It is brodcast on live television for everyone, including family members and friends, to see.  In the first chapter the author will grab your attention from the day of reaping. Who will be chosen? How will it affect their families?  This book will keep wanting to read to the next chapter. It is very discriptive. I have to say it is for older readers because of the violence and sadness of being forced to kill. I enjoyed reading about the main charater, Katniss Everdeen. The book tells the story from her eyes.  I loved reading this book through all of the twists and turns. Overall I would highly recommend it.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|I'm an artist and can definitely appreciate something different and new, but this movie totally sucked.

It was just too much, even with fast forwarding some scenes, it just kept draaaaagging on.  My husband fell asleep a few times, but I was determined to know that this movie was not a waste of time and money, but IT WAS.<br /><br />If you really have to see it, go rent it from REDBOX, but don't say you haven't been warned about how much this movie really sucks.

B000MRA5NS|5.0|I have to admit up front that I have a strong bias about the way I think James Bond should be portrayed. I like the old Ian Fleming style of Bond who is true to the books. We are talking a very serious Bond who is macho, resourceful and more than a little bit vengeful when he feels like he has been wronged. At the same time, the classic Bond of the Ian Fleming novels that I look for also sets the ladies on fire and is soo unafraid of his enemies that he literally laughs at them even as they appear to have his life in their hands. This guy never loses his cool and is the epitome of the word. He used to go by Sean Connery when off-camera but I feel very comfortable now saying that he goes by Daniel Craig these days.<br /><br />  In Casino Royale, we have a nice, modernized take on the very first of Flemings' Bond adventures. To summarize without giving away more than just basic plot devices for those who have not yet watched this movie, Bond is on a mission to smoke out a powerful money launderer who takes money and invests it for terrorist groups and other criminal organizations. Basically he demonstrates classic Bond wit by tricking his rival into losing all of his money in a game of chance which makes him a marked man by all the organizations he is a front for, rendering him an easy target for capture and use as an informant. Bond succeeds and in the process he manages to get into quite a few fights on the side. Despite being injured, again in classic-Bond style, he manages to get back to the table in no time flat and even clean up as if he never left his martini. The ladies fall for him and Bond himself, breaking one of his own rules to never fall for a lady, falls hard for his assistant, fellow MI6 agent Vesper Lynd. When she turns out to be a double-agent (not by her own choice), Bond goes on a rampage and is left scarred in the end. I should say more scarred as Bond is always a man who has a chip on his shoulder.<br /><br />  Craig hits the ground running in this his first journey into the BondVerse. He pulls off the character with a nice showing of suave but also with a serious dedication to dark justice right out of the novels, a cross between Connery's smooth demeanor and the more violent Bond of the Timothy Dalton years. The atmosphere, the music, the story and the acting is amazing and all seem to fall into place right where they belong. This is instantly one of my favorite Bond adventures.<br /><br />  The video and sound qualities are quite good, this being a recent hit release. I found no trouble here whatsoever- everything was crystal clear. I have read some reviews elsewhere of people having trouble watching this movie and others on certain players but on the PS3 it was just like at the theater as far as I was concerned.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />  In short, buy this movie. If you like James Bond at all you will enjoy it. If you are like me and enjoy the more serious Bond of Connery and Dalton over the somewhat more comedic and slap-stick Roger Moore years, you will absolutely love it. I never knock anyone who played James Bond and for good reason- Double-O-7's shoes are very hard to fill.

B00005NNMJ|4.0|Since there are plenty of reviews that cover the music well enough, I'll address the sound quality issue itself.<br /><br />The latest remaster with the 2 live bonus tracks is a horrible mess of dynamic range compression that crushes the life out of this metal masterpiece.<br /><br />There was a remastered version issued in the mid-90's without bonus tracks, but what you DO get is a top notch disc remastered by Sony's Vic Anesini. If you know your audio, then you know who he is & his talents are comparable to Steve Hoffman. The sound has the full dynamic range that makes this album sound so good & reveals how well produced it was. It gives the original vinyl a run for it's money & is worth seeking out. The original catalog number on the disc is: EK 39241.<br />He also mastered Restless & Wild at the same time, but it's this album that shines as one of the best sounding metal albums of the 80's. It's this version that allows you to hear it the way it was intended.
B002QE3CTY|1.0|This book has already lost one star. There is no text-to-speech.<br />***<br />I struggled and actually read into the fourth chapter and realized how many books (thousands) I have that I want to read and how this was torture as it just isn't my cup of tea, I am not the target audience, boys, so I don't think I can judge this properly. Bullying starts up right away. I read for fun, or to learn something. I don't like reading about, giving any credence to, bullies in any form. Even if the young man somehow triumphs over these guys, I don't care. Sorry.<br /><br />BTW, this was a library loan for Kindle. That was the only plus for me.
B000002JKA|5.0|Awake is perhaps their greatest work with Images and Words at a close second if not tied. If i could only to listen to one of their albums his would be it hands down. The musical chemistry is simply mindblowing on this piece.  I love how thereisn't so much \\"wankery\\". Yeah there are some moments, but it feels right. Ever since Kevin left this band has never been able to create work on par as this. I know they always want to progress and try new things, but nothing beats this album.  It pulls you in for more. This is the era of DT when their creative minds were most ripened. Now they are getting a little moldy...
B005K0HDGE|2.0|Stephen King might have chosen to write a time-travel romance, or he might have chosen to write a time-travel picaresque, or he might have chosen to write a time-travel thriller.  Unfortunately for the reader, he didn't choose.  Instead, he just threw all of this stuff against the wall to see if any of it stuck.  As a result, by the time I got the middle of the book I no longer cared whether the hero's attempt to change the past succeeded, failed, or killed him in the attempt.<br /><br />Parts of this novel are exciting and even satisfying, but the mind-numbing filler material in between makes getting to those parts a chore.  There's a fine novel in here somewhere, but unfortunately it's buried under a tedious, boring one.

A silly superhero version of the three musketeers that completely loses sight of the original story, but used the title for something completely different and oh so much less. If you didn't think that story and character matter much, then this is the kine of movie you would make. A string of action vignettes with no heart or soul. Nice.<br /><br />We couldn't finish it.

The pictures are great and form a nice foundation for the dialogue (almost the complete opposite of Arkham...another great book, just a completely different way to approach the material)<br /><br />The quality of the issue is very good.  Quality stock, nice gloss, great colouring, all in all, a very nice book.<br /><br />This one is also a keeper, and I'm very happy to own it.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Pop culture annoys me typically so when I saw how popular the upcoming movie was I was sure that I would be uninterested in the movie and especially the book - until I read about the plot and inspiration for this novel.  And then I kept hearing about it from co-workers who had read the books when originally released and my interest grew.<br /><br />It's good obviously - there are plenty of reviews here that will tell you that dating back 4 years!  My fear was the romance angle - was this just turning into a political version of the \\"Twilight\\" series? I am happy to report that the political and human interest angle of this was not drowned out with a romantic triangle in hopes of keeping any particular type of reader appeased!  You are in Katniss' head the entire time - a young woman who has not just these games thrown upon her, but extra responsibilities she never saw coming.  You get to see how she has to learn to deal with these as well.<br /><br />Many people told me the book was slow in the beginning, but it never seemed so to me.<br /><br />I know there are many right-wing American's who view this as a way of seeing how govt can go too far and get too large.  I see that as well when I read this, but not just in the 12 districts and their \\"tributes\\".  I see it as well in the people of the \\"Capital\\" who are kept distracted and somewhat immune from their leader's cruelties by an abundance of food, entertainment, and other material items.  And remember that it is the poor who are kept down and slaves to the rich in this book - sound familiar?  But I guess it's easy to overlook that oppression when you are given so many toys.
0345803485|1.0|I read this book because of the hype that has surrounded it, but honestly, it was just horrible.<br /><br />The Ana character is completely one dimensional.  If I had to hear about her inner goddess one more time, I was seriously going to throw my Kindle out the window.<br /><br />Christian couldn't decide if he wanted to be a dominant male or not.<br /><br />The author was repetitive.  Same basic premise for every situation, which causes Ana to flip out.  And then they have sex.  That's the basic formula for the book.  I also felt like the author would come up with a phrase and then she would use it repeatedly.  The inner goddess thing, and then the \\"fifty shades of\\" thing, which started half way through the book and continued on.<br /><br />The book was just really really bad, and not worth the hype.  I wish I hadn't of spent $9 on it!

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The book was recommended to me prior to the release of the movie. I purchased the electronic version for my Kindle. It was an easy read during my vacation. It's an action packed story, slightly horrific... but I believe that is the point. The ending was very satisfying. I haven't seen the movie yet to see how good they did representing the book. Not sure I want to.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Totally captivating. The characters come to life.  After reading about sheriff Holston I was totally shocked.  I always figure out books mid way.  Great job Hugh. You may have been a nobody yesterday...but today your on my list of favorites.  FYI I would have paid almost anything for book 5.  Once hooked.  I have reccomended to several people that are reading it now.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very fun app! It causes the competitive spirit to come out. :) It's not an app for little kids. That's the only down side.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I use it on mjy Kindle Fire. Wish I had an ipad, but oh well. This app is awesome. It keeps up with your location and comes back to it when you open it. I hiighly recomend it.
B006YW6KX4|5.0|Excellent 1950's 'Scope film by the usually weak director Joshua Logan filmed on location in Kansas. From the opening train whistle to the quilted farmscape ending this one is really well done....not as stagey as some of the director's other films....well worth it for Novak and Holden....beautifully framed by the great James Wong Howe.... Twilight Time did a fantastic job on this blu-ray....the nighttime scenes are exceptional....especially under the otherworldly Moonglow of the Japanese lanterns....
B0050R0YB8|5.0|If you are both a LEGO and Star Wars  fan you do yourself a disservice by passing this on this one. I know $400 is quite a chunk of change to cough up for a LEGO set but it is well worth it and like the other LEGO ultimate collectors series sets it will only go up in price so it's a investment also. You don't want to regret not getting this now when your looking at this in a few years with a $1000+ price tag.<br /><br />I found building it to be easy and enjoyable. It took me about 12 hours total to get it completely assembled (4 hours at a time over three days). The finished product is quite an impressive specimen to look at, it is nicely detailed and is 4'1\\" in length. It is also surprisingly sturdy and easy to move around because the underside of it is a solid piece so you don't have to worry about where to put your hands when you need to move it.<br /><br />Get it, You'll love it!
B001JNNDGA|5.0|The quality and the direction of this movie is Awesome !!! Even if you are not Christian this is a super movie!
B00003CXWV|5.0|Good movie about the rise of drug selling in the USA and I would recommend it. It is based on a real life story you must see the ending.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Deceptively simple puzzle game. Works well, though the level seems to refresh itself a lot, but it doesn't actually reset anything. Music is very relaxing as well.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|no glitches awesome game but need different type of music and faster loading your gun when hunting get it get it get it! ! ! ! ! ! !
B007Q476KU|3.0|The bad points first: This movie has a very slow start, is very contrived with \\"flat\\" human characters (with a couple of exceptions) and has some abrupt scene changes, all of which have raised a possibly 5-star film to 3 stars. However, it is very watchable and deserves a second viewing as well to appreciate it. It is BEAUTIFULLY filmed, it's almost as if you ARE there among the violence, cruelty of war--and bravery too. It's a wonderful story of kindness to and love of animals, and a joyful ending. It is (as might be expected) violent and dark, though not gory.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|I love this book. I found it very riveting and engaging. I can't wait for the next installment to come out.
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|I thought it was well done.  Best role Banderas has been in... since he was trying to not be american.  Best fight seens I've ever seen in a movie, better than any of the Bourne movies as far as realism.  It was too short and too simple overall but I thought it was excellent and I don't normally write reviews but I feel like the star rating thus far is way too low.
0345803485|4.0|First few chapters in I was already getting bored, but I kept going to see if the book would pick up. I did not expect the pseudo-BDSM erotica that was contained in the book. But, it was humorous. And while I quickly tired of the hundreds of 'sex' scenes, I was attracted to Christians broken character and couldn't stop reading. Was disappointed when the series ended, I wanted more.
0307593525|5.0|i am compleatly satisfied with these books julia child is a must have in every kitchen bottom line i hope everyone gets these books
0307591549|5.0|i had already bought the audio book and loved it so much i wanted to have the hard copy to make notes!
B005UBNL0A|5.0|The AMD FX 4100 is an absolute fantastic buy. At $110 it is one of the best bang for your buck processors on the market, i would put it only behind the other fx processors. It can handle any game today on the highest settings, and doesnt bottleneck my 6850 what so ever, and i believe it wont bottleneck any single gpu solution (accept MAYBE a 6990 or NVIDIA equivalent). It does all of this, and today's software isnt even optimized for its architecture yet. I would imagine that once it becomes optimized come windows 8, we will see a 10-30% increase in overall performance.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I will write a simple, quick review on how awesome this keyboard is for online gaming. I have very small hands. Ridiculously small. While it is built for an average sized male hand, I still have no problem using it. I often take the role of healer in games, and because of the keyboard, I have no need for healing add-on software, it responds that quickly.<br /><br />The software that comes with it to program the keys is ridiculously easy to use. All the macros are pretty much built in for you. Whatever isn't is easy enough to create. As an added bonus: it has not once lost my settings.<br /><br />I have used it for two and a half YEARS of unending, uninterrupted workability. It doesn't crash. It doesn't glitch out; especially during crucial game-play. The only reason I am buying another is because my four-year-old spilled an entire glass of soda on it -- and I lost the function of one (only) key. Sadly it's one of ten keys I use the most. But being it is in a house with four children that are tough on everything, not to mention hours of my gaming, and my children . . . this is one awesome keypad in a world of far too much \\"throw away/disposable\\" electronics. I can't even count how many regular keyboards and mice I have been through since owning the G-13! Thank you Logitech -- great product, well made.
B000V1Z8KK|1.0|I read the book \\"Point of Impact\\" before seeing this movie. The truth is if you don't read the book you will probably be OK.  I can't say because I did & therefore hated everything about this movie. The actors I have liked in other movies so I'm gonna guess most will also like them here.<br /><br />I remember having read the Stephen King novel Cujo  before seeing the movie (we won't even talk about the Shinning).  It was actually pretty well done getting a St. Bernard to become a totally evil antagonist. But like all who read the book at the end of the movie was shocked & I actually mean literally shocked when the boy in the end turns out to be alive. It was almost audible in the theater how those who read the book were saying \\"yep the boy is dead\\" to all who came with them to the movie. The boy who dies in the end of this book dies in this movie also but, during the course of his mother shaking him & crying he suddenly winds up being alive. Now some will say bogus, rip off, or typical happy ending crap from the typical movie types who always put out typical stuff anyway. BUT the truth was I actually thought it was done well. The boy was dead so long it gave us King fans a smug feeling of being able to state \\"yep that is right he is dead\\" & an ending that was a shocker like Point of Impact. If you watch the flick & see how long he stays dead you would probably get it. The fact that it was intentionally done & even aimed at the King fans that came made it that much more of a gotcha moment by the creators of this film.<br /><br />The point here is simple I don't mind some poetic license from movie makers but Shooter is just plain agony for Hunter fans! But the worst part is that some books just are perfect as they are, have not movie makers learned this simple lesson from the Godfather? I look at Shooter & wonder what they were thinking & as hard as I try the best I can come up with is NOTHING - NOTHING AT ALL....

B0013FDM7E|4.0|I know we're conditioned by the most action movies to expect a never-ending sequence of fights, explosions, and chase scenes.  This movie has few of these.  In fact, Will Smith's character is essentially alone (well, along with his German Shepherd) in a post-apocalyptic NYC wiped out by a mutating virus.  You might think this would make for a boring movie.  Some have found this movie to be that, but I did not.  The silent, self-reflective stretches of this movie give Dr. Neville (Will Smith's character) time to think, and we have time for that as well.  This makes for a richer experience, and makes me wonder if I've missed important thoughts or details in more action-packed movies, as I was carried along willy-nilly by the plot.  Obviously Will Smith's acting makes or breaks this movie; many could not carry a movie single-handedly the way this one requires.<br /><br />What I liked:  Will Smith strikes just the right balance between courage in the face of danger, and self-deprecating humor.  You would have to be comfortable in your own skin if you were, literally, the last man on earth.  The CG images of a NYC destroyed and overgrown by decay were mesmerizing and realistic.  I also liked the many small details of what he would have needed to do to survive.  Yes, fight the zombies; but you've also got to eat, and take care of your stuff.  Suspense of battling the inhuman night-creatures was riveting.  Some did not like the ending (no spoilers) but I was fine with it.<br /><br />What I didn't like:  In some ways not faithful to the book; but this was not a huge issue for me.  Others have felt that the plot got bogged down or derailed at times.  And extroverts would be disconcerted, and perhaps even bored, by the solitude of it all.  Most of the main character's witty dialog was with himself or his dog; not everone's kind of sci-fi movie.<br /><br />It's true that it was not what many of us have been conditioned to expect from the Hollywood movie assembly line.  Maybe that's why I liked it.
B00006I53S|5.0|I travel frequently, but do not have the space to carry a full camera bag. I travel to areas where anything of value in checked luggage will be stolen. So for a camera, I am limited to what will fit in my carry on bag. This means that I can take one lens with me. So the challenge is that with all the lens available, what do you take when you can only take one lens.<br /><br />For me, the Canon EF 28-135 is that one lens. It takes great shots, has image stabilization, and is relatively compact. I have used this lens all over the world, and have never been disappointed.
B00005JL78|5.0|Taut, well-paced sci-fi thriller set in the year 2054, where murders are prevented by visionary crime-fighters called \\"pre-cogs\\" who can see murders before they happen, and prevent them.  A cut above the usual science fiction fare, in the sense that this film relies on plot suspense, rather than being overly dependent on CGI, robots, spaceships, etc. to keep our interest.<br /><br />What I liked:  acting, plot, and dialog all first-rate.  Great story line.  Having that kind of power as one of the \\"pre-cogs\\", then having your own organization turned against you, is a chilling premise.  Nice special effects, but not overbearing.  Suspense is intense (hey, that rhymes . . . )<br /><br />What I didn't like:  Not much.  Some may find the plot confusing at times, with shifts between past, present, future.<br /><br />I don't do many reviews with five stars, not for films or books that are just OK, or just deliver the minimum of what you would expect.  But this futuristic thriller is so well-crafted, I can't think of what I would change.
B00006GO99|5.0|The seven-song Unique Thelonious Monk (1956) platter was the pianist's second during his remarkable five-year tenure on Riverside. His debut for the label was the aptly titled Plays Duke Ellington (1955) and once again, on this disc, Monk's song selection did not feature any original compositions. Rather, the well-chosen standards included exemplify and help further establish the pianist and bandleader within the context of familiar melodies at the head of a trio -- consisting of Oscar Pettiford (bass) and Art Blakey (drums). Regarding the personnel, while Pettiford had also accompanied Monk on the Ellington sides, Blakey replaces Kenny Clarke. The pairing of Monk and Blakey cannot be overstated. Immediately, evidence of their uncanny instrumental interaction is the rhythmic focal point of \\"Liza, All the Clouds'll Roll Away\\" as the two play musical cat-and-mouse. They cajole and wheedle atop Pettiford's undulating undercurrent as it sonically corals their skilled syncopation and otherwise inspired mile-a-minute interjections. This is starkly contrast to the haunting, lyrical piano solo on \\"Memories of You.\\" Monk infuses the piece with such profound ingenuity and integrity that his re-evaluation and innovative arrangement are singularly and undeniably his own. Fats Waller's \\"Honeysuckle Rose\\" reels with a frolicking and ever-so-slightly inebriated gate. It is likewise highlighted by Monk's dreamlike single-note runs up and down the keyboard and the stride piano-style chord progressions that preserves a fluidity within the tune. The advanced score maintains a guise of almost goofy abandon within Monk's highly logical and well-sculpted musical structure. The juxtaposition of \\"Darn That Dream\\" is another study in the vacillating moods of The Unique Thelonious Monk. The sophisticated performance is understated, yet remains loose and limber and perfectly in keeping with the album's leitmotif of exploring Monk's skills as an arranger and musician. As if he were testing his audience, the manic and atonal opening to \\"Tea for Two\\" -- briefly featuring Pettiford on bowed upright bass -- rollicks with a youthful visage, rather than being a simple reworking of this well-established classic. This LP concludes with one of Monk's most memorable pieces on the fun and freewheeling \\"Just You, Just Me.\\" The trio struts and glides as Monk's intricate fingering simultaneously displays his physical dexterity as well as his ability to play so deftly in the moment. Both attributes would resurface ten-fold once Monk began to animate his own compositions on the genre-defining Brilliant Corners (1956).audience, the manic and atonal opening to \\"Tea for Two\\" -- briefly featuring Pettiford on bowed upright bass -- rollicks with a youthful visage, rather than being a simple reworking of this well-established classic.

B001OQCV2E|4.0|I realize the Hollywood literati will look down on this movie, for its over-reliance on special effects (Las Vegas strip falling into a massive earthquake crevasse?  cool!) and predictable dialog.  But I never really felt this movie was trying to be more than it is; namely, a tremendously entertaining end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it roller coaster ride.  Same with Steven King or John Grisham:  they'll never be Nobel Prize contenders . . . . but we like them, because they know, just as we do, that they're not the next Shakespeare, and they don't try to pretend otherwise.  Same with this movie.<br /><br />What I liked:  Characters were an excellent cross-section of society: ex-spouses sharing custody, Russian mafia, self-serving politicians, and my personal favorite:  the off-the-grid survivalist radio host played by Woody Harrelson. I thought the last scene (no spoilers, but it involves some big structures inside a mountain) was really cool and interesting, made me wonder if we could really pull that off.  Some people are not fans of John Cusack, but I thought he was authentic and believable in this movie.  And special effects were off-the-hook, as many other reviews have noted.<br /><br />What I didn't like:  Not much honestly. As I said, I did not expect Out of Africa or Citizen Kane, so I wasn't disappointed that it didn't change my life.  OK, some of the subplots were cliche (the Russian bimbo and her dog, the lone politician with a conscience), and some of the dialog was less-than-brilliant.<br /><br />But the over-the-top CG, the quirky characters, and the what-if scenario of how the connected & powerful go about saving themselves as the world goes down the drain, all these were worth the price of admission.  I'm adding this one to my movie library.

B005EWDA9M|5.0|The more I read of this the more I loved it.  1Q84 is a challenging read, but once I got going I worked straight through both books.  The most frustrating matter upon completion was that the final book in the series was not available on Kindle.<br /> 1Q84 has been widely reviewed and lauded, so I won't repeat the words of many.  I will say that I think you would have to have an inclination for fantasy and a visual mind to enjoy this very contemporary work of imagination.

0345803485|1.0|If you are somebody who appreciates plot, character development, interesting and witty dialogue, or giving a rat's \\"behind\\" (as Ana would say) about what happens in the books that you read, don't read this book. If you just want to get your jollies, download some porn. I promise you the dialogue, plot, and sex will be better than it is in this book. I am having the hardest time getting through 50 Shades of Grey and I'm about ready to give up. I'm about 60% through and I don't know how much more I can take. It is taking me so long to read because I keep getting sidetracked by my daydreams of screaming at the idiot characters. I don't want to give details in case you are brave enough to give the book a try, but suffice it to say I wanted to punch every single freakin' character in the face.<br /><br />It's beyond repetitive. It has absolutely no plot other than will or won't Ana consent to be Christian's sex slave. I still haven't gotten to that part, but since there are two more books, well geez, I wonder what happens?  The characters are two dimensional (if that) and completely maddening. Considering the subject matter of the book, the language used insults my intellect and maturity. I mean, she can talk about butt plugs, but refers to her genitals as her \\"sex.\\" I don't know anybody in real life who uses that word in that way. It's beyond stupid. Also, it's supposed to be shocking that an unbelievably good looking and rich man who has never had a girlfriend and has been sexually active for 13 years has had a whopping 15 sex partners in 13 years.  Gimme a break.<br /><br />I didn't know it was Twilight fan fiction until tonight when I read the reviews. However, I have been thinking all along that Ana is Bella, Christian is Edward, and Jose is Jacob. And since the Twilight books are also amongst the worst books I have ever read, this is not a compliment. Ana may be the worst female role model since Bella, for much of the same reasons. Her entire life is about a dangerous guy who sweeps her off her feet and who makes her realize, for the first time in her life, that she is attractive to men. And I'm sure that just like Bella, by the end of the trilogy Ana will have been the one woman (girl) ever to win the eternal love of Christian Grey. So girls, just hang in there and put up with whatever crazy crap a man throws at you because even the biggest jerk in the world can change if YOUR'RE worth it. *gag*
B007IXWKUK|5.0|As much as I loved Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades #1), this book is where the series hooks you.  We begin not only seeing but also becoming angry over every childhood tragedy behind the darkness plaguing Ana's beloved Christian.  Believe me, it doesn't get much darker.<br /><br />Christian was born and raised for the first four years of his life by a drug-addicted prostitute (left with her dead body for four days before being discovered), beaten and burned by his mother's pimp, and sexually abused as a teenager by one of his adopted mother's best friends.  Man, who wouldn't be fifty shades of messed up after living through all that.  (All of this comes to light in book one and pretty early in the second book. so I don't really consider this information a spoiler.)<br /><br />Through Ana's non-stop probing, we find out all these things gently and gradually so that not one of them is too overwhelming.  With his responses and her reaction to them, we understand completely how she can fall in love with such a domineering man.  Like her, we accept 1) the fact that he still believes he is the little boy who was put in uncontrollable situations, 2) the reasons he never wants to go back, and 3) how difficult it is for him to understand that he must evolve if he wants kind, sweet, and gentle Ana to stay with him forever.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't mention the slap heard around the world in this book. There will not be a reader who regrets the way E.L. James masterfully embeds it into the storyline.<br /><br />One of the reasons this series is great is because there is always so much more to everything than that which meets the eye.  There are reasons behind every action and reaction.  I, as a lover of great books and an author, I adore books like this.  I appreciate how difficult it is to write people, scenes, and settings that are this layered and complicated.  This series is more than an erotica.  It's a romance (which makes your heart race with love).  It's an action and adventure (which makes your heart race with excitement).  It's just plain amazing.<br /><br />I'm left feeling pity for those who are superficial and can't appreciate the masterpiece created by E.L. James.  It would be comparable to someone saying that they hate Pretty Woman because Julia Roberts was a prostitute.  I promise you that if you say you like Pretty Woman...no one automatically assumes you want to be or bed a prostitute.  It means that you like a good love story.  That theory holds true with the entire Fifty Shades series.  Take it for what it is and don't hate yourself for liking it.<br /><br />I've said it before, and I'll say it again...I'm in awe of E.L. James and her ability to make this villainous man not only human but a lovable human.t's an action and adventure (which makes your heart race with excitement).

B000002VCQ|5.0|Thats right, \\"Whitty Huton!!\\"  I know the correct spelling, but you can't forget that episode of Martin (and you the rest..).  Now its a privilege for me to review the debut album of the late Princess of pop with a voice of a songbird and a beauty that captures the universe.<br /><br />The albums' first single, \\"Hold Me\\" (released in the spring of 1984 and originally released on Teddy Pendergrass' Love Language album) was very sentimental and sung with much heart, soul, and emotion by she and Teddy.  It reached #10 on the R&B charts, but it was'nt until a year later of which Arista Records releases Whitney's first single under her name which would be the Kashif produced top 5 hit (and first of its many), \\"You Give Good Love (#4 pop, #1 R&B)\\"  It was also noted to be the biggest hit single produced by multi-instrumentalist and super R&B producer, Kashif, who always mananged to produce many top 5 (and a handful #1) R&B singles by the faces of Melba Moore and Evelyn \\"Champagne\\" King, but never scored at least a top ten (or 20) pop hit until Whitney sang, sealed, and delivered this ballad.  She scored another top single with Kashif (peaking at #10) with the club hit, \\"Thinking About You\\" with him sharing part of the chorus with the 21 year old songbird.  Its my favorite Whitney song and her chemistry with Kashif is almost as great as it is with Evelyn.<br /><br />As the album was stalling to reach the top for the first half of 1985, Arista started to market her more into a pop artist by releasing the jazzy-lovelorn \\"Saving All My Love For You\\" (her first pop #1 and first grammy award - Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female); the Narada Walden produced clubber, \\"How Will I Know\\" (second #1 single); and the internationally awareness ballad, \\"The Greatess Love of All (third #1 single, by the wake of 1986)\\" and the rest is history.  All of Whitney's #1 singles (either pop and/or R&B) had videos, but the \\"How Will I Know\\" video established her status as a MTV icon (only a few black female artists had graced the rising station prior to Whitney).  The non single, \\"All At Once\\" is one of my favorite Whitney ballads and it blew up Adult Contemporary airwaves in 1985 and 1986 and would have been a treat if there was a video for the song, but Artista did'nt want to go crazy.  Labelmate, Jermaine Jackson produced three songs including two of which he sang with the songbird like \\"Nobody Loves Me Like I Do\\" and midtempo R&B number, \\"Take Good Care of My Heart\\" (the latter was previously released on Jermaine's 1984 self titled album in the summer of 1984, but never released as a single).  I love how the album established her as a pop princess (thanks to producer, Michael Masser) while retaining her R&B roots (with Kashif and Teddy Pendergrass) while mixing soul vocals with a pop/contemporary sound (with Jermaine Jackson and Narada Walden).  The album was a clean shot for \\"Whitty's rise to the top and shes just getting started.  R.I.P.
B0080CL0HM|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, I don't usually like period drama's but I was really taken in by this story.  Robert Pattinson totally proves himself as an actor, and the supporting cast is perfect.  Loved it!
B002Y4Z4UQ|5.0|This 1973 release solidified the Jackson 5 as full fledged adults  - in particular of Michael's full development as a full-fledged tenor - that the Jackson 5 could no longer sing the bubble gum soul songs hits that made them stars a few years back.  Still singing covers of selected Motown artists, The Jackson 5 and producer, Hal Davis put some more funk in these psychedelic soul numbers - \\"Hum Along and Dance\\" and \\"You Need Love Like I Do\\" - that they surpassed the success of the versions released by The Temptations and Gladys Knight & The Pips (although they were'nt singles).  My dad still has the vynil of which he purchased in 1973 (ten years before my birth) and told me that he partied hard on \\"Hum Along & Dance\\" as well as the infectious title cut, of which hit #2 on the soul charts and #28 on the pop charts (The J5's highest charting hit single since 1971).  This album was the origin of their biggest selling hit in years entitled \\"Dancing Machine\\" of which created much buzz when Michael first introduced the robot on a 1973 episode of Soul Train, just months before the single reached the top spot on the charts.  The single alone did so well that it was re-released on their next album, Dancing Machine one year later.  \\"Don't Say Goodbye Again\\" and \\"Its Too Late To Change The Time\\" were also performed on the same episode of Soul Train and these relaxed soul numbers balanaced out the Temptations-Larry Graham influenced funky stuff that dominated the album.  As well as the album has done and as more mature the group has become, they still were'nt satisfied with the fact that Motown did'nt allow them to take any control of their music, of which will lead to their departure of the label in less than two years.  I guess Motown not letting them do their thing may have been a blessing in disguise because Michael would later on become the World's Greatest superstar in the next 10 years after doing much of everything Motown had much denied of him.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There isn't much to add to the almost 600 five star reviews Wool has already received - just one more of them.<br /><br />While it's a ridiculous non-word that should lead to cleaning, 'unputdownable' is apt in this case.  In the last few days I've neglected everything I should be doing.  I've avoided work, drinks at the bar, the laundry and phone calls to finish the omnibus.  I don't have any clean clothes left, my partner is a little annoyed with me, a friend of mine thinks I'm avoiding him and I have several days of work to catch up on.  I was almost relieved to finish the omnibus, as it means I can rejoin the real world.<br /><br />That's how good this book is.  Just read it.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|Not just this one episode, but the entire series is one of the best things ever on TV.  The concept, the cast, the situations--everything is just right.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Anyone who enjoys a puzzle game will love the game Quell. This app is engaging and will keep you busy for hours!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this series.  An easy read that kept me interested the whole way through and made me think along the way.  How far away from this are we really?!?!?
B007VGXS8M|1.0|I thought this game would be a cerebrally engaging leisure activity like the books, it is not. The game has a frenetic time limit and sketchy controls. Just finding the objects is not enough, you need to find them rapidly to earn coins so you can advance in the game. Many times I would replay levels trying to remember where items were located to get coins. Not fun at all.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|cool for playing around and actually bright I would definitely. recommend. this to someone lastly it keeps little kids entertained
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I like that we can draw like a sharades but I found only one downside. My kindle fire after I have drawn something I will get out of the program and it leaves indentations of what I drew in the background. it shows up as a shadow in the background when I'm in the home page. I have to clear the data for it to go back to normal but then I have to sign in again. very annoying.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some games better than others, not a bad time killer. Ads can be annoying but it's free so can't complain too much.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|such a great idea ......lots if games some challenging some a piece of cake!! definatly a must have game fir kindle fire .. very addicting and fun and while playing it feels like it passes a lot of time!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ITS ADDICTING. lol I love this app. you'll be able to play for hours! ITS SO FRICKEN FUN OMG LOOVVVVEEEE THIISSS AAPPPP!!!!!!!!
B00000ADG2|5.0|I purchased this album, when I probably needed it the most. The music from The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is perfect, when you are at a crossroads in your life. Transitions are inevitable, in life, as is change. What better way to celebrate and explore this fact, than through music? Ms. Hill's brilliant and Grammy Award winning album sheds light on numerous topics. Lyrically deep and melodically intrinsic, we learn about what makes this amazing artist tick.<br /><br />One of my favorite cuts (of all time) is \\"Lost Ones.\\" She proceeds to knock her haters, with style and grace. It verges on scripture. The mean hip hop hook and smooth raps/vocals seal the deal for me. I could head bop to this, all day long, as I work out or do just about anything. My second favorite song is \\"Tell Him.\\" This is her love letter to God. Just smooth, makes me feel like I am at a revival. The interludes, between the songs, are wonderful. A teacher/speaker proceeds to lead young people through a series of guided discussions about life. The students are engaged, funny and insightful.<br /><br />What makes this album so exceptional is the smooth transition from genre to genre. Lauryn Hill blends them, like a pro. Hip hop, reggae, soul and samples are melded into a sound painting. Glorious.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Similar to bejeweled blitz but much deeper and so much more fun.  Highly recommended.  Best 2 bucks I spent since the half priced frappucino sale (that was this afternoon)
0345522478|5.0|This was a laugh out loud on the bus book about a 2000 year old druid named Atticus O'Sullivan, his wolfhound pet with whom he has a telepathic bond, and a broad collection of gods and goddesses from different cultures from Norse to Irish to Polish to Native American-even Mary and Jesus- and beyond, all whom seem to intermix in this series of exciting and funny novels.<br /><br />Written along the line of Neil Gaiman's American Gods (but with a lot more humor), author Kevin Hearne has created a great plot with several good hooks to keep the reader entertained.<br /><br />I've read the first 3 books in the series and for the most, they all have the same good writing and plotting.  I listened via audio file to a couple of the books and enjoyed those even more, especially when Atticus meets Jesus and they share a couple of shots of Irish Whisky with a beer back while Jesus gives Atticus advice on dealing with Thor.  This is the kind of clever pan theology writing that rings my chimes....Especially when Coyote steps into the picture on the side of Jesus-but still being coyote-not quite trustworthy.<br /><br />I suggest this series for older teens-there is some fairly graphic sex a couple of times, and a lot of violence with gods beating up on gods, druids killing gods and so on.<br /><br />I enjoyed it a lot and am looking forward to the next book in the series..I'm pulled between reading the books and listening to the excellent narrator.
B00785P2QC|4.0|_the game is fun if you have nothing else to do and its nice that it keeps running while you're away
B00407PNY2|4.0|\\"Bullitt\\", based on the novel \\"Mute Witness\\" by Robert L. Pike, is a police thriller directed by Peter Yates in 1968. Police Lt. Frank Bullitt (Steve McQueen) is asked by local politician Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) to protect a witness named Johnny Ross who is scheduled to testify before a Senate subcommittee on organized crime. Bullitt assigns his trusted Sgt. Delgetty (Don Gordon) and another officer (Carl Reindel) to take shifts with Ross, who is holed up at a cheap hotel, but the mob's hitmen get to Ross anyway. Bullitt is determined to find the killers, but the deeper he digs into the case, the more it seems there is more to it than meets the eye. Meanwhile, Chalmers blames Bullitt for losing his witness and makes a nuisance of himself, trying to obstruct the investigation.<br /><br />Steve McQueen plays the laconic tough-guy anti-hero that he was so good at here. The actor, an avid racecar driver himself, must have appreciated the 10-minute car chase on the streets in and around San Francisco that earned \\"Bullitt\\" a place in the cinematic canon. In 2008, Ford released a dark green Mustang Bullitt in honor of the film. William A. Fraker's stylish, fluid camerawork is also memorable. For a film with a measured pace and introverted characters, it has a lot of energy, because the camera, itself, is often on the move. The jazz-inspired score by Lalo Schifrin adds to the 1960s cool. And Robert Duvall has a small role as a cabbie with a good memory. After 45 years, \\"Bullitt\\" still conveys a sense of cool detachment punctuated by high emotions and harsh realities.
B007NYODBS|3.0|Good actors. Some witty dialogue. But I just didnt like it that much. Jody foster goes pretty over the top.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Can a reviewer give a \\"zero\\" star review of a book?  This was the worst book I never did finish!  The plot was confusing to say the least, the sex was boring, and the characters very forgetable.  I can not believe that it has created such a furor in the book world and that there are so many people trying to get a copy.  Save your money, folks!!  I am rereading PEYTON PLACE -- the book was written in 1954 and is a very enjoyable, well written piece of \\"women's\\" fiction that is still great to read after 50 years!
0671027344|5.0|I don't really know why I decided to read this book, but it was great. Charlie's letters are amazingly honest and are far from predictable. One of the better young adult books I can ever remember reading. I can't wait to see the film adaptation of it this summer.
0553801473|3.0|Ok. I jumped on the bandwagon of reading this series after the HBO series. The first three books were spactacular. Book four started to drag. This one more so with long chapters while the stories stall. It's losing it's charm and not sure if I'll wait eagerly for the next few books. Also the violence is increasing and getting a bit much
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|The first time I heard Wolfmother I was blown away. The distinct sound of their music is amazing, and the great depth to each song is incredible. Love the album, and all their songs, especially Vagabond, Dimension and Woman.
0307352145|5.0|Very deep insights about life as an introvert. Potentially life altering as it allows introverts to accept who they are and why is it they behave in such manner. Powerfully debunks the overrriding societal myth that one has to be an extrovert to be successful in life and in career. Masterful arguments coupled with concise language render it a page-turning sensation for any reader.
0345803485|5.0|After reading the first chapter on Amazon and hearing about this book for months, I finally broke down and got it.  WOW!!  I was  not disappointed.  I got pulled into the story right away.  I think it is a great romance.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The banter between the main characters is so witty and funny.  They had me grinning at their comments and laughing out loud.  If you are looking for a good romance that will get you hooked right away and keep you hooked, this is it!<br /><br />After looking at the reviews, I'm surprised so many people didn't like the book.  I enjoyed Ana's inner goddess and the e-mails back and forth.  James may not be the strongest writer, but she has strong characters, an intriguing story and some steamy sex to boot! I read this book in a few days and couldn't wait to read the next book.  I've finished Darker and I'm looking forward to starting Freed.  I love trilogies so you can see what happens next to the characters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I hate that it is over. The book was great! The whole series was wonderful. I can't wait to see what she writes next!
0345803493|5.0|I enjoyed this book even more than I enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey.  Once you start reading, it is hard to put down.  Ana still isn't afraid to question or challenge him.  They learn to compromise and she has a better understanding of why he is the way he is.  I enjoy their relationship and how they grow to trust each other more, their dialogue in their conversations and their e-mails to each other, and their sex scenes, which are as steamy as ever!
B004KA9UXO|5.0|In my opinion the Dune series of books by Frank Herbert are the best and most believable series of Science Fiction books ever written! I have read and re-read the series many times and find new details with every exposure to them. Quite definitely a must read for any fan of science fiction literature.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|We are addicted to this game.  The tile patterns and graphics are interesting without interfering with the game play.  Progessive levels of difficulty are fun.  The lower levels sometimes are insurmountable!  FUN!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I play this game nonstop it is so fun. I go to sleep at night and your town works. you wake up and you have 100000 more money.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies. Peter Sellers is amazing playing three very different characters throughout the film. George C. Scott is animated, funny and, well, believable. Slim Pickens seems to be playing himself which is perfect. Kubrick created a comic masterpiece and this DVD version has to be the next best thing to seeing it on film, projected through the darkness of a cold war movie house.
0439796644|5.0|While this book was written for children, it is a great read for all ages! Told from the view point of Joey, the horse, it makes the narrative unique.  I loved it!
157421327X|5.0|These books arn't very thick but there are a great many doodles and tangle ideas.  I'm really happy with this purchase.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a fun game I love anything Irish. reminds me some of Mario. kept me playing for hours. fun!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Can't recommend this highly enough. Imaginative, well written and filled with edge of your seat action. Have not had good luck with many self published books, but this one is the exception.
0739352962|5.0|This has been one of the best audio book collections i have ever listened to. The narrator is amazing and he makes this unabridged audio book set come alive.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|With so much buzz around the Hungar Games I decided that I had to give in and read it for myself. It was sepll binding!  This is a must read for people of all ages. It is the perfect combination of action, drama, and romance!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have read most of David Baldacci books and have never been disappointed.<br /><br />Whenever I see or hear of a new book by David Baldacci I reserve it right away.  He is an awesome writer.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its great I love this game :)) I think that some of the games are kinda dumb but there great :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fabulous quick read!  Looking forward to the 2nd book in the trilogy! Better than the movie!  Highly recommended for mental escape!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are cool. I haven't had any problems yet. It would be more fun with older games. Also if it should you how to play the games.
B007RJUHB4|5.0|This Unplugged album makes me even more determined to see Florence + The Machine in concert one of these days. They are amazing and sound just as good live as they do on their studio albums. I really like the Unplugged CD, which features a lot of their top songs and some new ones as well.  If I have any complaint it's just that there was nothing super mind-blowing on the album...a couple of new covers, but that's it. Nothing bad about any of it, though. Add it to your Florence collection.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|My daughter (14 years old) read this book in one day. She really enjoyed it and she would recommend it to any friend.
0762434260|1.0|This is our second wand, the first one broke in a matter of minutes, the only spell it can cast is the one that breaks itself in two.... Read reviews and post your own experience, if my wife would have done that I would not be spending the time to ship this back, twice........ DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU WANT IT TO BREAK!!!!!! Sticker book, it's just cheep stickers....
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I enjoyed playing until the item timers started resetting to extremely long times. An item in the infirmary that should be ready to pick up now has 174 hours to go. I could try to wait it out or sell the broken houses/buildings and build new ones, but it keeps happening. I'll probably delete this from my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Update: Nov. 1, 2012. I was playing, as I've played this game for months. It closed and when I went back into the game, it started over from the very beginning. Not a happy camper.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|&agrave;I like this game a lot but I wish you could control how the samurai attacks other than that I like it
B005DOL0R0|4.0|Nice and good price. Fullfills what it was made to: protect the Kindle. Would be better if there were other colors to choose.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love reading my books on my Dell Streak android tablet. However, I have accumulated lots of books and there appears to be no way to organize the books in categories or collections. It appears that you can do that with the actual kindle reader. Why isn't this available for the app? I want to keep the books that I  have read away from those that I haven't. That is the only thing keeping this from a 5 review!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely love these books! I don't usually read books, so it's amazing when I can find books that I not only like, but can't stop reading! Just absolutely amazing and breathtaking books!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is an awesome series and would recommemd it. It keeps you wanting to keep reading to see what is going to happen next
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its a pretty entertaining game. I wish you didn't have to wait for energy to build up but other than that I love it!
B007MU85D0|5.0|This album is amazing.  I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it. The harmonization of the two singers is incredible & the songs addicting.  I gave it to 3 of my friends as presents & they all immediately loved it.  I highly recommend it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really enjoy this game on my kindle fire. the only thing I'm annoyed about was that I bought extra dollars and had to restore my fire and my progress and dollars disappeared. besides that its very fun and addicting.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I really love the new stripped down mix of Double Fantasy.  It sounds more like John and what we loved about him from the earliest Beatles recordings.  I wish they would do the same stripped down mix for Milk And Honey!!!
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|Like many people I know the story of Edward and Wallis.  And unlike many people I always saw it as a romanticized tale.  Edward VIII gave up a throne he never really wanted, but this film asks us to consider what Wallis Simpson surrendered.  Most histories see her as having gained advantage by her position, this film suggests otherwise, and rightly so. As for Wallis and Edward, watching him ask her to dance for his amusement, even in old age, says it all.<br /><br />I had heard some of the negatives, but wanted to see Madonna's interpretation, and I found the film quietly effective. I'm not a Maddona fan, but as a director she was foreign territory.  She did well, intertwining the two stories, the overlay of emotions and the gentle stripping away of a veneer that's been so frequently painted over the story.  I followed the modern narrative with more interest than expected, and overall found the film very satisfying. The attitudes of George V and his wife are speculation, (they're portrayed as weak and shrewish) as the film overlooks how much they were forced to sacrifice when Edward VIII abdicated.  After all, the stress and pressure of the throne were serious factors in George V's early demise.<br /><br />Perhaps Madonna is saying something about her own misery with fame (albeit, self inflicted) perhaps not, but forget she's there and enjoy the film.  It is fair enough to say that she has more talent as a director behind the camera, than as an actress in front.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|good game.  love it.<br />the gameplay is pretty straightforward but there are lots of options for you to choose.  upgrade your skills or upgrade the others with you...  which will help you the most?
B001VZY4M8|1.0|I can sum it up in one sentence: The mix is so poor, you can barely hear the french horn solo in the title track! Find someone who has the original disc, burn it and listen to this wonderful gentle simple album.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|This was well-written - thank you!-and a thoroughly enjoyable read. Engaging and entertaining, I found myself caught up in the emotions and world created in the story as well as the characters. I had a slight annoyance with the characters' reactions, particularly the heroine, in running away instead of asking questions and talking to each other, but that is an admitted personal thing I have with stories of this nature and was only a minor distraction. Recommended for a sexy, hot, good read. I'm looking forward to jumping back into their world and seeing their journey together unfold.
0307165485|5.0|If your children like Busytown Mysteries, they will LOVE this book!  This is a hardback book with a ton of stories in it.  My boys who are 3 and 5 years old LOVE this book.  They are excited to listen to a new story every day.  Our family loves to read and this book is perfect for our boys.
0385342063|5.0|This was a fun and very quick read, as always with a Sophie Kinsella book!  Poppy is about to get married, but as the wedding gets closer she loses her engagement ring!  This leads her to a cell phone that connects her to Sam.  Now besides all her wedding plans she finds herself drawn into Sam's business world and a life that may just be better for her than her fiance, Magnus.<br /><br />I enjoy all of Sophie's books but after reading this book I am excited that a new character may be getting a sequal! Poppy is a much more immediately likeable character than Becky, in my opinion, and I hope Sophie will tell us more about Poppy in the near future!<br /><br />The footnotes were the only part of the book that I really could have done without after the initial point of them, but not enough to take a star away. :-)
B004XDYJRU|5.0|TRP allows me to listen to my favorite radio stations whether they be local or across the country or world. Absolutely fantastic at home, work and on the road. Cannot recommend it enough!
B005QMOZOO|4.0|I know in the depths of my mind that Jane Austin would say that liking this is akin to liking reality TV, but I don't care! Death comes to Pemberley gave me a voyeristic glimpse into life after the end. It is a great read, and adds a modern spin to well known characters.
B007J7LFTW|5.0|Now this is what music should sound like. The 5.1 audio on this disk ran through a high end player sounds like nothing I have ever heard before. It sounds as if the musicians are in your living room with you playing live. I have never in my life  heard music sound this good. And I have listened to hi fi music for 30 years. Your ears will not believe what you are hearing. Well done Ian and co. And Steven Wilson for the mixing kudos as well.
0817439390|5.0|I have come to love Bryan Peterson and his books and video's. This book has some great photographs but most importantly it gives insight into how Bryan was seeing the subject of each photo and how he adjusted his camera as he approached taking the image. I have taken photos for years but am just now trying to learn to be more creative with my photos rather than just taking snapshots in auto mode. This book has been very educational as well as enjoyable to read and study.
0545091020|5.0|I watched the movie first, then had to get the book or the cd's. It is very much like the movie. Just a few small things changed. So naturally I had to get the other two books to this series. I did get the audible on the other two, it was just handier for me. It was great and worth the money.
B007SSEBCU|1.0|The most predominant image left in my mind after watching this film is of an aged Thatcher (Streep) staring ahead looking bewildered & weak, again & again & again (like this point wasn't made the first time).  I knew very little about Margaret Thatcher before watching The Iron Lady & was hoping for a much better historical account of her place in Brittish & world politics.  Politics aside, she was a strong & remarkable woman. I feel terribly sad for her that a film maker chose her dementia to be the most intriguing tale of her life.<br /><br />To be honest, I wish I had never watched this film.
0393088774|5.0|Nobel-laureate Dr. Krugman's book is very insightful and readable. He lays out his sensible arguments very clearly and very succinctly. He outlines what nearly every economist believed 20 years ago - that austerity is exactly the wrong tact to take in slowing or recovering economy. Even today only a few idealogically-driven economists believe the opposite. In the \\"on the other hand\\" news media of today that cut-government-spending fringe gets too much attention, too much funding from the greedy portion  of the  wealthiest 1%, and of course support from the Republican  in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail who are almost wholly funded by those billionaires who feel they don't have enough.<br /><br />The cut-taxes-on-the-rich-and-cut-benefits-to-the-working-poor-and-middle-class-in-a-recession crowd is simply wrong. They are just being mislead by the self-serving, loud-mouth part of the wealthy class. History shows it. Hoover turned a recession  in the Great Depression. That recession was caused by a burst investment bubble caused by wealth concentrations caused by a GOP tax cuts on the rich ... Sound familiar?<br /><br />This is the time for government to compensate for reduced lending and spending, even if it runs up the national debt. Even those who deny that the New Deal government spending helped get us out of the Depression say that World War II got us out of it. WW2 caused government spending and debt to reach the levels (as %of GDP) that we are at now. It worked out well  with the 1950's bringing us the best economic times the world has seen.<br /><br />It's during those good times that the debt should be reduced and even small surpluses run to prepare for the spending needed during the next recession.<br /><br />Want to see some tax plans that jump-start the economy, cut the chances of future recession, slash the debt in good times, and save the working-class and middle-class thousands of dollars in taxes each year? Google \\"Fair share taxes\\" to see a variety of plans that put Dr. Krugman's ideas into action.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great for people like me that just do not seem to find time to read God's word or that stumble over it. So many of the names are hard to read it is nice to have someone reading along with you.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Plays great on my Kindle Fire. Nice soundtrack. Puzzles are challenging, but not impossible. Worth more than $1 for sure.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|It was a heartwarming story of a boy and his horse.  The movie was uplifting, and moving with a great ending.
B000KFTWIG|5.0|Christopher Wallace (aka The Notorious B.I.G.) gave a retrospect to his people in Brooklyn and becomes a lyrical-talented rapper with one word to describe him: Legend. He is the King of New York. The King of Hip-Hop. And no other rappers that can't stop his reign was his undeniable voice that revolutionized the 90's into an era of decadence. \\"Ready to Die\\" was one of the greatest hard-hitting albums of all time. One of my favorite songs on the album were \\"Juicy\\" and \\"Warning\\" because when I first hear the album on Itunes, Biggie changed the game and how he's living from a former drug dealer to a rags-to-riches larger than life megastar that dominates chart after chart and every day I started listening to KDAY in Los Angeles, every B.I.G. song comes on and everyone is still showing some fanatic support for the good memories that he shared with Diddy and make a couple of records. Back in Coachella 2012, I was shocked when I saw a performance by Tupac in a hologram and I was like \\"What the {beep]? Is that really 2Pac? Is he alive?\\" I was thinking out of my mind when I started tweeting with my brother and he saw it on Youtube a couple of times and wow. I wished someday real soon, I hope they could make a hologram of Biggie Smalls. Why not tell the people who you truly represent and let the world know 'Where Brooklyn At'? Maybe at the next Coachella or at an award show like the Grammys or the MTV VMA's, anything. And for 15 years after B.I.G's murder mystery, the police still didn't capture or find more evidence on both 2Pac and Biggie's assailant. I still need some answers and it's time for justice for Biggie and his beloved mother. The case will not be forever solved until this masked gunman is behind bars. Biggie will forever and will always be a loyal and heroic figure in the hip-hop community. God bless you, Biggie. Rest in Peace! I still can't believe Street Fighter II was in the \\"Juicy\\" music video.
0345803485|5.0|It might take a few chapters to really get into this book....but then you are hooked!  I had several friends who were reluctant to read it based on the negative reviews they read on this website.  After some prodding from me, they gave it a try.  I can't begin to tell you how much they ALL ended up loving it!!  Out of 6 of us, 5 read it in one weekend.  I have not passed this book to a friend yet who hasn't raved.<br /><br />Don't let the 1 star ratings sway you.  Give it a try for yourself.  Numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the New York Times Bestseller list can't be wrong!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good way to waste a lot of time. Ads are only on the start up page, big deal. Unfortunately I missed this on the free app of the day, but got it for half price anyways. Well worth it. I've played a lot of Mahjong games and this is one of the most entertaining. Not traditional, but super fun.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was unsure about this book when I purchased it. I actually purchased the print version as it was slightly cheaper and although I have a Kindle, I still enjoy reading a print book. As I read the book, I found it to be an entertaining read, though definitely intended for mature audiences. The biggest problem that I had with the book was the ending. I did not like how it ended, though perhaps that was the intention of the author as I have since ordered both sequels. Overall it was a good story and well-edited. I would recommend, but only in conjunction with the other two books (the ending really sucks for this one!)
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I probably wouldn't even have thought of watching this film, but somebody suggested it to me, so I figured it might be worth checking out.  It is Ghibli, after all, and they're usually pretty exceptional.  Still, I was a little surprised by just how much there was to enjoy.<br /><br />Firstly, this film is not at all like Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away, or other Ghibli films (in fact, really, no Ghibli film is quite like any other.)  It's more adult.  Not as adult as Princess Mononoke, but pretty adult nonetheless.  I'd say late childhood-early teens at the earliest.  There's a lot of adult references and remarks.  There's name-calling, the main character smokes, there's plenty of alcohol in this movie, and illegal arms trading...  All that stuff you see in adventure anime.<br /><br />I loved it.  This film kind of reminded me of a cross between the story of Beauty and the Beast and Casablanca.  It takes place between the first and second world wars, and the main character is a fighter pilot, who retreated from Italy to get away from the fascists (and yes; they use the word \\"fascist\\" in context in this film.)  He was also somehow cursed, and now he has the head of a pig and is rather overweight.  However, there's no more information given about the curse than this.<br /><br />There's action, adventure, high-flying air battles, drama, romance, suspense and great escapes in this film, as Porco is shot down by a rival and has to get his plane repaired, so that he can settle the score.  Porco himself is something of an anti-hero, but the film treats him with respect, and in the end, he...  Well, the ending is a bit ambiguous, but if you're a regular viewer of Ghibli films, you may have come to expect that.<br /><br />If you're wondering whether this film is right for you, or for your children, just ask yourself this; would you sit your children down in front of Casablanca?  If the answer is yes, then this film should be fine for them as well.  I really don't think there is any film that makes a better comparison with this one than Casablanca.  They're both film noir, they're both drenched in 1930s terminology, speech patterns, character dynamics and scenarios, and they both contain most of the same things that modern adults don't like kids seeing.  Guns, cigarettes, liquer, etc...  No foul language in either case, but that was expected in the 30s.  This movie isn't any tamer than Casablanca, despite being animated, but it's also no less tame, despite being made in the 90s.<br /><br />Still, Casablanca was one of the greatest classic films of all time, so the very fact that I'm comparing Porco Rosso with it repeatedly is probably a sign of something good.  I just know I loved this movie, and I hope you will too.

Done in epistolary format, it showcases a delightful friendship over the years. Humor, kindness, life, and books. Trust me, try it.<br /><br />Also, I wish books still were this inexpensive...

B000002WPI|1.0|Wuzup ya'll? I love hip-hop to the fullest.. my favorite rappaz are Fred Durst, Kid Rock, Lil Wayne, Vanilla Ice, Young Jeezy, Ja Rule, and Soulja boy.. but these Wu-Tang fellaz are WACK!  These guys can't rhyme to save their life and they have no real undaground feel.... The Song \\"bring da ruckers\\" makes no sense and doesn't have a catchy beat at all!  These posers should take a few lessons from Lil Wayne and Pitbull if they want to be successful in the music world!<br /><br />Be sure to avoid stupid wanna-be rap groups like Run DMC, Wu Tang, Public Enemy, NWA, and those annoying Beaties Boyz!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It's pretty clear that Marvel's entire film-making machine was leading up to this effort, a movie that nobody thought could be made because it involved Hollywood putting aside egos, directors joining forces, and intellectual property being leveraged in such a way that everyone plays nicely together behind the scenes, even if the characters don't play nicely together on screen.  Somehow, God bless them, Marvel actually pulled it off.<br /><br />Picking up where \\"Captain America,\\" \\"Thor,\\" and \\"Iron Man\\" left off, the Strategic Homeland, Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (SHIELD) led by Nicky Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), commands a ragtag band of agents that just happen to work on a flying aircraft carrier: Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders, unfortunately miscast), Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner, not quite as sarcastic as he should be) as Hawkeye, and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johnannson) as Black Widow. Their mission is to retrieve the Tesseract (AKA the Cosmic Cube) from Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his Predator-like race of alien soldiers known as the Chitauri.<br /><br />There are so many ways this film could have gone wrong, and part of \\"The Avengers\\"' success is that Marvel took its time building up to this moment with its previous releases. Asgardian god-hero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) could easily become a walking caricature, but he's such a tower presence that he demands to be taken seriously. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) as Captain America is slightly diminished here, but he settles comfortably into his role as a brilliant tactician out of time but not out of his depth. All these serious characters are just banter-fodder for Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) as Iron Man, who shamelessly stirs things up when things goes down.  The one worrisome character was Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) as the Hulk. With two tepid films under the character's belt, the Hulk was potentially \\"The Avengers\\" weakest link.<br /><br />No need to worry.  The Hulk is one of the best parts of the film.  Ruffalo plays Banner as a scruffy Doctor Without Borders, a brilliant man who gives off a zen vibe because you wouldn't like him when he's angry. Joss Whedon, master director of all things geeky, knows how to build up anticipation.  Whether it's the massive firepower that's never brought to bear against Banner or the trembling lip of the deadly Black Widow, we're always reminded that at any moment \\"The Big Guy\\" might show up. When the Hulk finally does arrive, he does not disappoint; the Hulk's rage is exhilarating and terrifying to behold, a green King Kong. Also, the Hulk's got a great sense of humor, embodied by his rivalry with the only guy who can stand up to him, Thor.<br /><br />Whedon does an excellent job of balancing the weaker characters, notably Black Widow and Hawkeye, against the superbeings who stride amongst them. Black Widow has two scenes that demonstrate how deadly she really is even against god-like beings, and Hawkeye's archery is unparalleled. There are not one but two tracking shots in which every character struts their stuff.  If you go to \\"The Avengers\\" film to see them duke it out, against each other and alien monsters, you've come to the right place. This is going to be hard to top.<br /><br />And oh yeah...shawarma is a real food.  Stay to the end of the credits.rts of the film.

Him and Lil Wayne have paved the way for the music of the future.  What would the world be like without such genius entertainers like Drake!?  He teaches old school posers like 2Pac and Biggie how to rap and he does it with style.  I would have given this album a few more stars but Drake didn't include a duet with Justin Bieber :(
B0080CL0HM|4.0|The quote used in the caption for this review is form the writer of the novel on which this film BEL AMI is based - Guy de Maupassant, whose stories are characterized by their economy of style and efficient, effortless d&eacute;nouement. In many ways that quote summarizes the plot of this story.<br /><br />BEL AMI  is set in Paris in the upper-middle class environment of the leading journalists of the newspaper La Vie Française and their friends. It tells the story of Georges Duroy (Robert Pattinson), who has spent three years of military service in Algeria. After six months working as a clerk in Paris, an encounter with his former comrade, Forestier (Philip Glenister), enables him to start a career as a journalist. From a reporter of minor events and soft news, he gradually climbs his way up to chief editor. Duroy initially owes his success to Forestier's wife (Uma Thurman) who helps him write his first articles and, when he later starts writing lead articles, she adds an edge and poignancy to them. At the same time, she uses her connections among leading politicians to provide him with behind the scenes information which allows him to become actively involved in politics. Duroy is also introduced to many politicians in Madame Forestier's drawing-room. Duroy becomes the lover of Forestiers' friend Clotilde Marelle (Christina Ricci), another influential woman. Duroy later tries to seduce Madeleine Forestier to get even with her husband, but she repulses Duroy's sexual advances and offers that they become true friends without ulterior motives instead. In a few months, Charles Forestier's health deteriorates and he travels to Cannes to regain it. Soon afterwards, Duroy receives a letter from Madeleine imploring him to come to join her and help her bear the last moments of her husband's life. As Forestier dies, Duroy asks Madeleine to marry him. After a few weeks to consider, she agrees. Georges now signs his articles Du Roy (an aristocratic style of French name) in order to add prestige to his name. The married couple travel to Normandy, the region of Georges's childhood, and meet his peasant parents. Finding the reality different than her romantic expectations, Madeleine feels very uncomfortable with his parents and so their stay with them is short. In the newspaper office, Duroy is ridiculed for having his articles written by his wife, just as the late Forestier had his articles written by her. His newspaper colleagues call him `Forestier', which drives Georges mad and he suddenly becomes heavily jealous of Madeleine, insisting that she admit having been unfaithful to Forestier, but she never does.<br /><br />In order to suppress the stings of jealousy, Duroy starts an affair with Mme Virginie Walter (Kristin Scott Thomas), the wife of the owner of the newspaper. He especially enjoys the conquest as he is her first extramarital lover. Later on, however, he regrets the decision, for he cannot get rid of her when he does not want her. Duroy's relations with his wife become chillier, and at one point he takes a police superintendent to a flat in which his wife is meeting a minister. They catch the two in the act of adultery, which was then a crime punishable under the law.<br /><br />Duroy's ascent to power continues. Duroy, now a single man, makes use of his chief Rousset (Colm Meaney) daughter's (Holliday Grainger) infatuation with him, and arranges an elopement with her. The parents then have no other choice but to grant their assent to the marriage. The last chapter shows Duroy savouring his success at the wedding ceremony at which 'all those who figured prominently in society' were present. His thoughts, however, chiefly belong to Mme de Marelle who, when wishing him all the best, indicates that she has forgiven him for his new marriage and that their intimate meetings can be taken up again.<br /><br />Directors Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod are novices and the pacing of the film could use some polish. The sets and costumes are the stars and the musical score by both Rachel Portman and Lakshmam Joseph De Saram and cinematography by Stefano Falivene mange to creat the atmosphere of La Belle Epoque well.  The cast is strong, though the title role of Georges Duroy (aka Bel Ami) feels undercast: Robert Pattinson lacks the depth of subtlety in his current acting skill to be convincing as the poor cad of this rags to riches via abuse of women role.  It will be interesting to see if this film will last once it is released in theaters.

1576875776|5.0|Vivian Maier is a treasure. Earthy, gritty, insightful, real. The reviewer whining about the quality of the photo reproduction forgot to look at the price tag. The overall quality of this book is EXTRAORDINARY for the price. If you've never seen a $100 photobook, the quality of this one will seem fabulous to you. My guess is that John Maloof wanted to make Vivian's work accessible to the masses because her photographs are of the masses. Look at her images and you instantly feel what she felt. That's art.
B00005J6T1|4.0|Released in 1983 and taking its' own sweet time to catch on, Madonna's self-titled debut album is still a fun collection of light, fluffy early '80s tunes including the hit singles \\"Holiday\\", \\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Borderline\\" as well as some great lesser-known material inspired by her days at Danceteria.<br /><br />The infectious cowbell-and-drum-machine driven \\"Holiday\\" remains a dance-floor favorite nearly 30 years later and is known by heart even by non-fans, but the hypnotic \\"Everybody\\" surpasses it for sheer dance-floor intoxication. The bland \\"Borderline\\" never really grew on me--it sounded a little dated even then. The non-hits \\"Think of Me\\", \\"Physical Attraction\\" and \\"I Know It\\" feature fun, synth-heavy '80s arrangements and even in this early stage Madonna shows range. When she goes from pouting \\"Tell me what I did to you to make you treat me so badly\\" to scolding \\"You better, you better\\" in \\"Think of Me\\" or sexily and brazenly challenging her undecisive lover (\\"What are you gonna do?\\") in the delightfully futuristic, celestial \\"Physical Attraction\\" her delivery is perfect.<br /><br />The real showstopper here is the scorching ode to female horniness that is \\"Burning Up\\". In one of her most convincing performances Madonna proclaims her sexual frustration by first simply stating \\"I can't quench my desire\\" then in a final desperate confession \\"I have no shame\\". Nasty little guitar licks underscore Madonna's heavy panting in this lust-drenched dance-rocker. While the original album cut is the best thing about \\"Madonna\\", make sure you get the remastered CD with the Bonus Tracks because the 12\\" version actually improves on it. Though the guitars are missing, the extra frantic keyboards make up for it and Madonna's vocals are more in the forefront.<br /><br />Madonna's fate was already sealed with this album--she would quickly become and be forever known as the Queen of Dance Music. Still a fun ride all these years later.

0375413405|5.0|I first read reviews on French Amazon, where most reviewers appear to have come to this volume through the movie Julie and Julia, and seem to find it a minor contribution to their knowledge base.  I guess my age is showing, but I first heard Julia on TV in the early 1960s when I was a California teenager, and I had never in my life heard about cooking like this. I bought this book then (and I still have that same copy).  Actually I bought it originally to give to my mother, who was frankly a terrible cook who hated being in the kitchen, but she was insulted at the implication, so I kept it.  Julia introduced me, and America, to accessible French cuisine.  Before Julia, US cuisine was a wasteland, and those who first come to cooking today clearly don't realize how great an influence she was then.  Much has happened in the culinary world since Julia, and today her book perhaps does seem a bit dated...we already KNOW this and that...but then we didn't, and she was a revelation.  She changed my life. This is a brilliant book, despite all the butter.  There is no other like it.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|My husband and  I agreed to watch \\"The Avengers\\" due to previous good experiences with watching both \\"Ironman\\" films, \\"Captain America\\" from last year, and \\"Thor\\".  In my opinion, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, and Chris Evans all gave strong and convincing performances in their roles as Ironman, Captain America, and Thor.  It was also entertaining watching Scarlet Johansson's Natasha Romanoff character holding her own when confronting Mark Ruffalo's Dr. Bruce character.  My husband's favorite character was that of Loki played by Tom Hiddleston. I can understand this because Hiddleston plays a powerful and complex being who proves to be a strong challenge for Thor.  For me, it is a tie between Downey's Ironman character and Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury persona.  Downey plays the role of being the braintrust in deciding how to defeat Loki.  Meanwhile, Jackson projects strong leadership and encouraging skills when gathering the appropriate forces to battle Loki.  \\"The Avengers\\" is best for anyone who has enjoyed any of the previous films: \\"Captain America\\", \\"Thor,\\" and either of the \\"Ironman\\" films.

0385344228|4.0|This book held my interest from the first page to the surprise ending. It's a terrific, thought-provoking story. However, just a few weeks after finishing this book, I saw a 1996 movie called \\"Before and After.\\" The two stories are so similar I can't believe it's mere coincidence; looks like out-and-out plagiarism by William Landay, I'm sorry to say. In the movie, a son -- whose name is Jacob! -- is accused of killing his girlfriend. The father (Liam Neeson) destroys incriminating evidence. The movie and book have different endings; and in the movie, the dad isn't the son's defense attorney -- but the stories are essentially the same. The movie is based on a book, which if I remember correctly, was authored by Rosellen Brown and published in 1992. In any case, \\"Defending Jacob\\" is a book that grips the reader and doesn't let go until the last page. I thought it was a terrific read, but my respect for the author dropped dramatically after I watched the movie and got that \\"deja vu\\" feeling!
B004SIPAJG|5.0|It's been a favorite for years in our home, and to finally have it on DVD is GREAT!! I watched it again last night...it's just a really cute, funny and FUN movie!! Highly recommend this for strictly family entertainment!!! No/very little cussing, no nudity, just pure carefree fun!!!

0345803485|1.0|So far I'm about halfway through this book and nothing has happened.  It's as if the author wrote one chapter, then copied and pasted it a bunch of times.  The writing is just so bad and beyond repetitive.  If I read that one character murmurs something to another one more time I think I'll buy a thesaurus and mail it to the author.  It's getting to the point where I'm excited when I read they are whispering to each other just for a change of words.<br /><br />The other one star reviews are spot on with the writing and the story in this one.  It's like it was written for teens but the author threw sex into the mix.  Since I've heard the second book in this series is better than the first (and I made the mistake of buying all three at one time) I'll keep reading but I wish I'd known all this ahead of time. I sincerely hope all other erotica is better written than this and geared towards adults...

Being a Rob fan, I couldn't wait to see it. I loved this movie. I think it is probably his best work yet. I liked that it didn't have much down time. It was a pretty fast paced movie and it kept my attention. I have not read the book, but seeing as I liked this movie so much, I can see it in my Kindle library soon. $10.00 well spent and I can watch it as much as I want in the 48 hours I have it. That's much cheaper than the theater.

It is a little pricey, but really it is worth the money. I got her 2 years ago and she's been through a lot (washing machine, a full bathtub, lots of dirt, etc.) but she still looks good as new. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a Peach that looks realistic and isn't afraid to go a little higher than $15.

This should be the movie of the year!<br /><br />Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) returns home after fighting in the war against Iraq.  He has changed his last name to his deceased mother's maiden name and he goes by to see his father.  His father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) was an alcoholic and abusive husband and father.  Tommy ran away with his mom 14 years before to get away from the torture.  Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) stayed behind as he had a girlfriend and he wanted his father to pay attention to him now that his favorite Tommy was gone.  They all grew up hating each other for many reasons!<br /><br />Tommy joins a local gym and quickly volunteers to fight the number one contender for the World Martial Arts middleweight belt!  In 20 seconds the fight is over and Tommy has completely destroyed the contender.<br /><br />Brendan is about to go bankrupt and lose his home as they are buried in medical bills from his youngest daughter's heart ailment.  He and his wife are working three jobs to still become further behind in debt. Brendan hasn't told his wife that he is street fighting again as he can make more money in one night than he can in a month on a second job.<br /><br />A billionaire promoter sets up a cage Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) gala titled Sparta!  Both brothers make it into the group of 16 scheduled fighters and are quickly considered underdogs.  Tommy is the brute and brawler and Brendan is the finesse and tactician style of fighter....<br /><br />I cannot express to you how good this movie is.  It makes every fight movie you have ever watched pale by comparison to this movie.  The actors did a wonderful job depicting their characters and I really enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />Not only are the fights good but the storyline about the family and their relationships is well written and acted out.  This is a dramatic drama about a family perhaps finding some solace in each other after many years of hatred and isolation!<br /><br />If you like action movies and fighting movies that also have a good story then this is the next one you have to watch!and acted out.  This is a dramatic drama about a family perhaps finding some solace in each other after many years of hatred and isolation!<br /><br />If you like action movies and fighting movies that also have a good story then this is the next one you have to watch!
0061906220|5.0|We were first introduced to Pete the Cat at a story time at our local library. My younger kids loved it, so I purchased it at the school's book fair. Now all of my kids and my husband and I all love Pete the Cat and enjoy reading it at bedtime and other times during the day. We downloaded the song and sometimes listen to it as we turn the pages. My 3-year-old twin boys can literally tell the story by themselves without the book present. I think they really \\"get\\" the moral of the story to keep on walking and singing your song. That sort of tells them that maybe they don't need to cry or complain about every little thing. This book has a very positive feel to it, which we all need. The song is catchy, so the message stays with you. I would recommend this book for any age!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great way till kill time.  Many different games so it never gets old.  Highly recommended.  Download and do not look back.

B005LAIGYQ|1.0|I think the other one-star reviews of this \\"Act of Valor\\" make good points.  It's appalling how this film advances the Russian propaganda of framing the resistance in Chechnya as the terrorists, while the systematic violence of the Russian government that Chechnya's people have suffered is ignored [[ASIN:0226674339 A Small Corner of Hell: Dispatches from Chechnya]].  It's exactly the same manipulation that takes place here in the U.S., where our long history of state violence is ignored, while the blowback is totally removed from the context in which it takes place [[ASIN:B001HWCNCI Blood and Oil]].  Chalmers Johnson, a veteran of the Korean war himself, wrote the classic book on the topic of selective outrage and how governments have a blind spot a mile wide [[ASIN:0805075593 Blowback, Second Edition: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire]].<br /><br />Another one-star reviewer made a good point about the military cultism he saw in this film.  I imagine that reviewer, like so many people here in the U.S., doesn't have access to much independent analysis (like the radio show, 'Democracy Now!') that further confirms his point.  Most of our elite establishment media feeds the cult-like idolization of the military; but, here and there, a person can find resources that expose the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about [[ASIN:0805089195 The Complex: How the Military Invades Our Everyday Lives (American Empire Project)]].  Eisenhower also warned us about how the military complex would affect our spiritual lives as well.  His warning, and the workings of the warfare state, are brilliantly presented in the film, [[ASIN:B000FBH3W2 Why We Fight]].<br /><br />We desperately need to stop the Big Government and Big Business collusion that is bankrupting our country through the endless waste, fraud and abuse of Pentagon spending; and end the suffering caused by our perpetual warfare.  Our best defense, and the best way for citizens to act in a valorous way, is to seek honest critiques of war-mongering and the propaganda that makes it possible.  To that end, I'd recommend the following movies.<br />[[ASIN:B00118SUHU War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death]]<br />[[ASIN:B003JUINFM The War on Democracy]]<br />[[ASIN:B004C39E3K The Tillman Story]]<br />[[ASIN:1893521931 Peace Propaganda & the Promised Land: U.S. Media & the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict! Media Education]]<br />[[ASIN:193286900X Reel Bad Arabs How Hollywood Vilifies A People. (DVD)]]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this novel. I thought Collins is a great story-teller. I picked up the book after watching the movie, and I wasn't disappointed by either. I was shocked that there has been online turmoil about the selection of the characters for the movie. Collins created great characters that were easy to envision.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this book is that it is geared towards young readers. I thought that the ideas and descriptions of death were too mature for children. Collins took out sex and curse-words, but the violence may give young minds nightmares.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|We are always on the edge of our seats with this series. Can't wait for season 5! We are hooked on this program (well, maybe I shouldn't say that considering the subject matter!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think that you should have your Bible where ever you go and now this being so portable this makes it much easier. I also love the reminders that pop up and say &quot;five minutes with God can change your life&quot;
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I heard Dana Perino mention this & the other 2 books on  \\"The Five\\" on FoxNews.com that I thought I'd take a look at it.<br />I only read what Amazon lets you read as a sample. i can not comment on the story because I didn't read it. What I didn't like was the style of writing. I am not a fan of someone talking to themselves and that is what I read in the sample. I don't know much about editing, but I have read many many books in my life time, and found that the story did not flow smoothly. So I am afraid I will pass on reading this trilogy regardless of it's popularity.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game. wish there were more levels. wish it did not make you go through main menu every time you have to go back to the home screen.
B007FH9GT2|2.0|I loved the plot, but the movie flow and production was disappointing.  The acting was only fair despite an all-star cast.  Two stars...
B003G4W49C|3.0|I purchased this book having seen all the positive reviews. I've read a fair amount of SF books but always skipped over this one for some reason. Overall I agree that it is well written and generally held my interest, but I don't personally view it as a classic of sci-fi. Maybe it would have resonated with me far more if I had read it at the age of 12 or 13, rather than 25. While Ender does deal with some hard-edged stuff like murder, genocide, and family issues, much of the plot revolves around his anxieties about making friends, bullies, and dealing with school pressure. Worthwhile topics for sure, just not as relevant to some audiences as to others.<br /><br />Aside from that, my only major issue with the book is the side story of valentine and peter transforming into political demagogues. This is where the book drags, badly. I suppose it was necessary to include something to break up Ender's often repetitive scenes, but unfortunately these side vignettes add little of interest or value to the overall story. In more than one case I found myself skimming through those sections.<br /><br />In any case, the story is decent and the ending was satisfying; I just didn't find the book to be all that memorable.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Was there ever a Paris more exciting and beautiful to an American than the Paris of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Stein? What better way to escape the unbearably dull and shallow modern world! In this delightful fantasy, Woody Allen fulfills our deepest wish--and makes us laugh! Reccomended for all, with a special nod to literary nuts and Paris lovers.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is one of the best games for the kindle. I can play it for hours straight! and its not like other glu games where advancing is impossible if you don't spend ur own money!
B007UXTG8M|2.0|With the exception of copious amounts of nudity, there's nothing particularly visual about this film and given that most of the drama is internalized for the characters, the material lends itself to a play much more than a film. The writers struggle with where to locate scenes - an endless series of 'talking heads' pieces are set in restaurants, bars, offices and literally any of the locations are interchangeable because this is a dialog driven movie. And there's really not much dialog.<br /><br />Rarely the fan of 5-minute camera shots with zero editing and long stares that rely on the audience to work out the narrative, I find it hard to recommend a story that truly has no plot. The hero is an sex-addicted sketch of a character who can mysteriously stare any woman into bed. His sister sings dreadful depressing songs in bars that would drive any sober clients away and anyone intoxicated towards jumping off the nearest high building. There a strong hint of incest in their past but nothing in their history is ever shown so you have to conclude:<br /><br />- The sister started an incestuous relationship that pushed the brother into a life of meaningless one-night stands.<br />- The brother started an incestuous relationship that destroyed the sister's subsequent romantic relationships and the brother is so ashamed he can no longer have meaningful relationships.<br />- The sister wants to start a relationship with her brother.<br />- None of the above and these two people just need some therapy.<br /><br />The whole setup had the capacity to deliver an interesting story but its a damp squib and instead I have to watch Michael Fassbender walking around naked and going to the bathroom. In terms of the editing, or lack of, there are countless scenes that just go on forever with no sense of pacing whatsoever, including:<br /><br />- A 5-minute performance by Carey Mulligan of \\"New York, New York\\".<br />- A multi-minute jogging sequence through the city, which is also incredibly poorly lit.<br />- A torturous single-cut restaurant scene that could have come straight out of a first year film school project. (Remember the screenplay rule of avoiding scenes in restaurants?)<br /><br />The other weird thing is that the accents are all over the place. Anyway, there is something to the idea of the movie but it's not in final draft format and would have been more suited to a play. In terms of a review, there's not a single person in my circle of friends or family who would enjoy this, and the only reason my wife didn't stop half way through was because I'd hidden the remote.dibly poorly lit.<br />- A torturous single-cut restaurant scene that could have come straight out of a first year film school project.

0312641893|5.0|My thoughts:<br />Take the story of Cinderella, add in some androids and cyborgs, a plague and oh, evil moon people trying to take over the world. Doesn't sound like it would work? Wrong! Cinder is all of these things and more and it's fantastic!<br /><br />Somewhat dystopian, somewhat hard science fiction, Cinder tells the story of Cinder, a cyborg (part human part machine) living in New Beijing. Her life is not entirely her own as she is under the control and ownership of her stepmother who in true Cinderella fashion, pretty much hates her.<br /><br />I really loved this retelling. It's unlike anything I've read in a long time and reminds me of the science fiction stories my father use to feed me as a kid. Cinder's world is amazing. The cyborgs and androids (fully robotic machines) were enough to keep me engaged but this story has so much more to it. There is tension and well done, not over the top romance. There's a scary as hell plague and a mysterious legacy that may hold the key to everything. And a lot more I'm not going to talk about because you should really just read it for yourself :)<br /><br />Final verdict:<br />I pretty much loved this story from beginning to end. The first of 4 books that I'm pretty sure I will be devouring as soon as they hit the shelves! Marissa Meyer's debut is a fantastic science fiction / fairy tale retelling / dystopian explosion of awesomeness! I highly recommend this book to fans of these YA genres.<br /><br />**I received a copy of this book for review**
B0073ODRKG|5.0|Simple put, this is an incredible amount of quality music at a fantastic price.  And, like the review title says, this is perfect if you've only had a taste of Madonna and would like to dig a little deeper than say \\"Celebration\\" or any of her other hits compilations or, like me, you're an all out Madonna geek and you try to snap up all of her output for your collection.  The five star rating for me is, again, based simply on this amazing body of musical work, but, no matter who you are, this packaging is somewhat disappointing.  The compact size of the case is an absolute plus and no doubt contributed to the low cost of the final product, but Warner Music could've absolutely put a hair more effort into this particularly given that M is an artist who has consistently put a lot of thought and design into her album art.  The clamshell case is a matte finish heavy card sleeve which can get damaged and scuffed a little too easily and the print quality on many of the card sleeves is a bit muddled looking.  Funnily enough Warner Music Europe's repressing of her first 5 studio albums on vinyl have the same substandard print quality on their sleeves so perhaps in their rush to capitalize on the release of \\"MDNA\\" a few corners got cut.  Personally, I would've preferred a more substantial outer packaging, and then perhaps glossy finish card sleeves, but, hey, that's just me.  As most other reviewers have mentioned, there is a lot of important Madonna music not included here, including \\"Vogue\\", \\"Crazy for You\\", \\"Into the Groove\\", \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", and the Oscar winning \\"You Must Love Me\\" from \\"Evita\\" just to name a few.  But considering the staggering number of hit songs that are here and given that we're in the digital age where these missing pieces can be downloaded in the blink of an eye these omissions aren't deal breakers.  So, A+ music, but C+ for the packaging, and all in all an excellent value.  As to the albums themselves:<br />1.  MADONNA (1983) still sounds relatively fresh all of these years later and includes such modern pop classics as \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\" and her enduring dance anthem \\"Everybody\\" which launched her career in April of 1982.<br />2.  LIKE A VIRGIN (1984) has sold over ten million copies in the U.S. alone but remains my least favorite of her records.  Yes, the title track and \\"Material Girl\\" are trademark Madonna anthems, but, singles aside, the rest of the album is mediocre.<br />3.  TRUE BLUE (1986) represented an absolute shift in her music towards a more adult sound beginning with haunting lead single \\"Live to Tell\\", and continuing on with tracks like \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" and \\"Open Your Heart\\", plus the mid-tempo Latin flavored \\"La Isla Bonita\\".  On the negative end of things the arrangements and synths fairly scream mid-eighties which dates the material considerably, and when she indulges in almost cute-sy, pop throwback songs like the title track and the percolating \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" things get a bit saccharine for my taste.  Bonus points for the shoulda-been-a-single track \\"Where's the Party\\".<br />4.  LIKE A PRAYER (1989) was an absolute pinnacle at the time, and remains a high watermark not just for Madonna but for pop music in general.  It spun off 5 U.S. singles and an additional sixth single released internationally.  Her collaboration with Prince is a bit odd but intriguing, and funnily enough she recycled a few of the lyrics to their collaboration for 2005's hit \\"Hung Up\\".<br />5.  EROTICA (1992) was consciously, over the top, in your face, and this turned off some fans and instigated a major backlash following the almost simultaneous releases of her book \\"Sex\\" and notorious film flop \\"Body of Evidence\\".  Still, there's some great music here that's not to be missed including the title track which samples Kool & the Gang's \\"Jungle Boogie\\", the dance anthem \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", the mid-tempo \\"Bad Girl\\" and the beautiful ballad \\"Rain\\".<br />6.  BEDTIME STORIES (1994)  marked a shift into a moreR&B, hip hop influenced groove including collaborations with Dallas Austin, Babyface, and Nellee Hooper, and in retrospect making a perfect bridge between the previous record and her next, \\"Ray of Light\\".  Lead single \\"Secret\\" went gold and the gorgeous ballad \\"Take a Bow\\" remains her biggest hit in this country spending 7 weeks at number 1 on the Hot 100.<br />7.  RAY OF LIGHT (1998) was another benchmark and worldwide critical and commercial hit that combined the introspective songwriting she achieved with longtime collaborator Patrick Leonard with cutting edge electronica provided by techno wizard William Orbit.  A truly superb album.<br />8.  MUSIC (2000) Do you like to boogie-woogie?  The title track remains one of the most influential sounds of the new millennium.  Here she collaborates with Frenchman Mirwais Ahmadzai to create a techno sound combined with an almost folksy, acoustic influence.  More bonus points for yet another shoulda-beeen-a-single cut, the stunning dance floor stomper \\"Impressive Instant\\".<br />9.  AMERICAN LIFE (2003) Like \\"Erotica\\", this one went too far for some fans, and, admittedly, it is one of her more challenging records.  Musically the sound is very similar to \\"Music\\" as she works again with Ahmadzai, but here the folk influence is even more strongly felt on both the melodies and lyrics.  She covers much of the same subject matter as \\"Ray of Light\\" but without those songs' polish and finesse.  Still, it's a highly underrated album with many good qualities, including the hardcore dance track \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", the beautiful \\"Nothing Fails\\" which plays like the musical love child of \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"Like a Prayer\\", the mid-tempo \\"Intervention\\", and the simple, stripped back ballad \\"X-Static Process\\".  As for her Bond theme \\"Die Another Day\\", you probably already either love it or hate it.<br />10.  CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR (2005)  Working with Stuart Price she creates an absolute masterpiece here.  Sampling Abba lead single\\"Hung Up\\" was a record breaker the world over and managed to go top ten in the States despite a lack of radio support, second single \\"Sorry\\" references The Jackson 5 hit \\"Can You Feel It\\", and \\"Future Lovers\\" is a kick butt dance floor filling homage to the sound of 1970s disco maestro Giorgio Moroder.<br />11.  HARD CANDY (2008)  She worked here with her highest profile collaborators since '94 with mixed results, although after the euphoric high of \\"Dance Floor\\" almost anything would've been something of a let down.  \\"4 Minutes\\" was big hit, but for many Madonna fans was not representative of the album as a whole as it made Madonna sound like a guest star on a Justin Timberlake/Timbaland collaboration rather than the other way around.  Happily her work with Pharrell Williams and the Neptunes are much more satisfying including lead cut \\"Candy Shop\\" and second single the fierce \\"Give It 2 Me\\".  Her \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" cuts it musically much too close to comfort to Timberlake's own earlier hit \\"Cry Me a River\\" but works nevertheless, and album closer \\"Voices\\" remains haunting.
B0063IH60K|4.0|cool game. I have always liked solitare. hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
B001HN6922|5.0|I saw so many things that I recognized. It probably means more to me because I love car shows. I identified the European makes and the American models. There were many corollaries between the performance of those cars and the characters they represented. I felt like I was revisiting cities in Europe where the races took place. They were brilliantly drawn and the depth of field was excellent. The many references to the Bond movies helped. For me there was a lot of humor in the portrayal of the human emotions of the cars.<br /><br />I liked the storyline and the animation a lot more in Cars 2 over Cars 1. This was a rare case where the sequel was better than the original. I read a lot of the negative reviews but I was thoroughly entertained and not offended by the dialogue that touched a lot of people's nerves.

B007549W62|4.0|I won't rehash the plot. I thought the story was very believable. I can understand people going insane under those circumstances. The great divide seems to be between people who hated and loved this movie. I'm on the fence. Wish I could give it two ratings. 5 stars for the acting which was top notch and a lesser rating for the depressing plot which left a few glaring holes--for me. I'm sure the idea was to create the same fear and uncertainty in the audience as in the characters in the movie. It succeeded in doing that, but I would have liked to know a little more about the enemy. 4 stars for a thought-provoking look at the break down of desperate people.
B004FOA84A|4.0|its a great game. worked great on kindle fire. one thing though if it wasn't for the hints I wouldn't of finished the game. thanks for the hints.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I picked these up for a nice discount at 21$, and after reading a couple of reviews, I only saw a few complaints. So I picked them up, and for the most part, I'm not disappointed!<br /><br />There are a few design issues, however. So I'll just list em' off:<br /><br />1. Alot of people were complaining about the set being a little too tight. While I don't think this personally, I can see where they're coming from. The cushion inside the headphones aren't enough to keep your ears from rubbing up the inside of the set, which can cause some discomfort. I've found myself pulling the cup from my left ear away a bit just to get it a little more comfortable.<br /><br />2. For me personally, the wire could be a bit longer. While I have no issues with it, I can see how I could have had some. While I don't have a specific measurement for the wire, I'll just say those sitting a bit farther away from their actual computer, and have their monitor and such set up somewhere else, you may find yourself needing a longer wire.<br /><br />3. The cups aren't adjustable. By that, I mean they can't 'turn' left and right, which makes the set seem rigid. Though, it's nothing major. Ironically, my old headset's issue was that I accidentally had the wire caught under my chair, and when I pulled the headset up from off my table, it broke a piece of plastic that allowed the cups to turn in those directions. When that broke, the left cup was incredibly flimsy, so maybe this isn't really a design 'flaw' as much as it is a 'choice' from the makers of the product.<br /><br />4. The audio wheel seems like they were trying to go for looks over function. It's this odd wheel, which you can see in the pictures above, where it's laid out horizontally, rather than vertically on the wire. The issue with it, is that I've had times where I'd mute the headset using the wheel, but I'd still be able to hear sound a bit inside the cups. It's nothing major, but trust me, I wasn't TRYING to hear the sound. You can hear it just fine even with the wheel turned down.<br /><br />I havn't tried the microphone, but the set for listening is quite nice, especially for it's discounted price. If you can look past it's flaws, it's a pretty good headset to get.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|there is no exit option without completely shutting down and it also freezes good concept but a lot of glitches.

0142419400|5.0|I have to say I loved, loved, loved, this book! I've wanted to read it for quite a while, and just never found the time.  But after getting to meet Stephanie in person at a convention, I bought the book and had her sign it for my daughter and moved it to the top of my tbr list.  I'm so glad I didn't put it off any longer.<br /><br />I loved having Paris as the setting for this story, and the wonderful descriptions made we want to hop on a plane and go there.  It was like getting to go on vacation in my mind!<br /><br />The characters were all well written and refreshing.  I could see each of them in my mind as I read, falling in love with their personalities and characteristics along the way.  There was a good amount of teen angst, which I always love in a teen book, as well as fun protagonist and a swoon worthy guy! Swoon worthy guy is an absolute must, of course! I loved that St. Clair wasn't too cliche of the normal swoon worthy book hero too.  He was just himself, as were all the characters, and that's what made them both real and loveable.<br /><br />I really liked the way Stephanie writes, with her living in the moment, present day style.  I am definitely a new fan, and I already have my copy of Lola and the Boy Next Door sitting on my night stand.<br /><br />This book is a homerun, hit out of the park! Fantastic!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a really fun game.  only thing that sucks is you have to unlock all the games. other than that its somehing to do to pass time.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|If you are looking for a great series please start here. The entire series is great. R.A is my favorite Fantasy author, and I think he has the best story line involving elves.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|I just finished this series in just over a 24 hr period. It could easily have been a trilogy, except for the fact that Mac had to do a lot of growing up. I won't be recommending this series to anyone, simply because I did feel there was so much filler in the middle books of this series. I have to say the sex scenes left me uninspired. There were many things that bothered me about these books: Barrons like Mac to have a different hair colour, the story was difficult to follow and extremely vague at times ( a technique I've seen Stephen King use is his lesser works), and that most of it didn't make any SENSE whatsoever. It was totally spaced out a lot, and I would always be looking for dialogue so I'd know where I was in the story. It's like thought streaming any old thing to pop in your head and so much FILLER!!!!<br /><br />I did like the Dublin worldbuilding and sense of the entire town. I never really knew what Mac was at the end.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I love this group, and I think this was their best CD. I liked this CD much better than the newer Cd's. All of the songs were good.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is addicting and interesting. it is kind of entertaining. it is fun I guess. not amazing but not boring either.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought this was a good book, so good and interesting that I bought the 2nd book of this trilogy on my Kindle Fire.  I'm reading it every night (which is a rarety for me), so you can say this book has my attention.  I also saw the movie as well, but the book goes into more detail.  I would recommend it.
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|The Innocent is a fresh new start for David Baldacci. After some earlier classics like The Winner and Absolute Power he lost his way a bit with The Camel Club series but The Innocent is one of his better attempts in a while. Will Robie is a great character and hopefully more of this series to come!
B004LWZW8I|2.0|Basically this movie sucks! Henry Cavill is, as always, awesome. He makes an excellent Theseus, looks fabulous shirtless and can act. Micky O'Rouke is wonderful, impressively evil and scary. Luke Evans is good as Zeus. And the visuals, colors, composition, are excellent. But the story and dialogue are ridiculous. Why did they used the names of Theseus, Phaedra, etc., when those characters have over 2,000 years of their own powerful, meaningful legends, mythologies, books, poems, movies? And Steven Dorf, second billing, was out of place and looked bad next to the godlike Cavill, Theseus.
B005FISC52|5.0|For those of you who are sad as I am about One Tree Hill ending, don't give up before watching the 9th season! This has potential to be one of the greatest seasons yet! Mark Schwann really brought OTH back to the beginning, tied up loose ends and brought the return of familiar faces. So wonderfully done, it was over sooner than I wanted!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game and play it all the time. my only dislike is having to do the visiting and share stuff!!
B005TBWN0K|5.0|Draw/Writes better than so-called handwriter apps.  It auto-smoothes, unlike writing apps. ,Too bad it's meant only for pics.  Otherwise, I'd be able to use it a lot more.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is fantastic.  bringing the Word of God to the world.  it may be the vehicle for this church's greatest legacy

B007MDB71O|5.0|I'll make this short John Carter was a excellent movie! Unfortunately the critics panned it before seeing it,also Disney didn't promote it they way they should of. It's hard to believe it was written 100 years ago. Before the movie came out I down loaded a copy of \\"A Princess Of Mars\\" and was really impressed how well it was written and the imagination of Edgar Rice Burroughs,and you will be very impressed by the stunning visual effects, the acting and the film score. I believe the Movie captures that spirit of the original novel completely. I hope down the road there will be a sequel or hopefully sequels to this well crafted film.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very very very addicting.LOVE IT!!!! and whenever I'm bored I'll go straight to this.Also I like that there's a bunch of different animals that you don't see in your everyday lifetime
B002QRWJA4|4.0|The most interesting thing about this is it's not the normal on-stage actors but everyday Hollywood actors and as little training they had in singing, they were very good.  I enjoyed it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is great! I love it! the game is fantastic if you know the controls. I suggest you download this RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
B00729GQ0A|4.0|Let me begin by saying that Rebecca Hamilton is a relentless marketer.  When I first heard of this book, I did not believe it would be interesting to me.  However, after the onslaught of guerilla marketing she has unleashed upon the world (and I say that as a good thing), I decided to give it a try.  To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.  This was an excellent story.<br /><br />I will spare you a synopsis of the book as the book's description handles it well.  While it only scratches the surface of what the book truly contains, I think to reveal anymore would do a disservice to those who have not read it.  It is a story that must be experienced to be believed.  Instead, I will hit on what I feel are the most important things that someone deciding to read this book should know.<br /><br />I have been reading Sci-Fi and Fantasy for many years and so one of the first things I look for is the world building.  Because I have read so much, I have a tendency to believe I have read it all.  However, I must say that Hamilton has surprised me with some very interesting concepts.  She has taken some different concepts and weaved them together into a world view that is pretty unique.  Her treatment of Wicca and the Salem witch trials proves she did at least a little research.  There were some other creatures of myth I recognized, so she must have done a little more research.  Having done a fair amount of research into many of these things myself, I really appreciated the effort.  Obviously this is a work of fiction, but I think some maybe surprised as to where the line between truth and fiction actually lies.  Ultimately, it is the way she blends vampires and shape shifters into these other concepts that is just brilliant and quite unique.  Like many, I suffer from vampire burnout but she manages to make it fresh and interesting again.  She has created a mythos in her world to serve as a backdrop for her characters that is a little bit like a lot ofthings but in the end is wholly different from them all.  For this reason alone, I enjoyed the book.<br /><br />The second thing I look at are the characters and hers are well written.  From the main characters to the supporting cast, all of them were realized enough to add to the story.  I found the main character of Sophia to be very authentic.  She reminded me of people that I have known and I found most of what she did to be quite realistic and wholly endearing.  The supporting characters were well done.  Not overdone nor underdone, they served the overall story.  As additional main characters were layered in, they blended into the story perfectly.  I thought the relationship between Sophia and Charles to be extremely well done.  At time I found some of their exchanges annoying but in a very real way.  If they bothered me at all, it was that they were sometimes too real.  It's sometimes hard to speak of realism when discussing fantasy novels but the overall realism of the characters is what really struck me.  The story and characters evolved naturally rather than just having the characters dive right into mortal peril.  Though it made the story advance more slowly, it made for a more convincing tale and I appreciate that.<br /><br />Finally, I look to the story itself and the writing.  Hamilton's writing style is very easy to read and connect with.  It is effective at engaging the reader and pulling them in to the story.  I was able to get into her style quickly which made it easier for her to grab my interest early.  The plot evolves at a nice pace and while it is impossible to not be able to predict some things, I can say there were a few surprises.  There is a flashback sequence that is a little lengthy for my taste given its location in the story, but it is full of important information so it was necessary.  The plot flowed nicely with its ups and downs.  There is high emotional content in many places including an ending that will cause some mixed feelings.Overall I was satisfied with the story.  Knowing this was going to be a series, I was pleased to see the story definitely ended.  Yes, it is also obvious it will continue but this part of the story was definitely resolved which was well done in my opinion.<br /><br />The only reason that I gave this book 4 stars is that in the end I was sort of right in the beginning, this isn't the type of story I would typically get into.  However, I can say that I was quite impressed with this book and when the next one comes out, I will read it.  If Rebecca can maintain this momentum, she will have a bright publishing future.  I, for one, can't wait to see it.
B007BRJYF2|1.0|ok wished I could play this game but all I can do is keep installing over and over it will not open. wish it would hope it gets fixed soon was looking forward to playing it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this installed on my phone &amp; my Kindle Fire. It is easy to use; finding text is quick &amp; simple. The reading plans are a great addition &amp; all the translations to pick from make comparing texts s breeze.

B006L4MX0Y|5.0|I watched this after watching hunger games and I can officially say that I enjoyed this more than the hunger games movie, the only thing good about HG is Jennifer Lawrence. This movie is more action pack and is not afraid to show death to get the message across of the dangers of being hunted by your peers. All in all I enjoyed this film.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this app is easy and handy to use. i wish more versions were available offline.  I still need to dig around and figure out all the features.
0345803485|4.0|I loved this book.  It got so much hype and I expected to be glued to the sex scenes.  I would not say that this was the case.  I think the sex scenes were a bit overrated and didn't do all that much for me.  However, I enjoyed getting to know these characters and I desperately wanted it to turn into a love story.  Overall, it was a good, fun read.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|It is too bad that the author is deceased.  I would love to have read more in the saga.  Page turning material.  A great read for Kindle!  I have recommended the book to everyone, including my wife and 16 year old daugther.
B003X897D2|5.0|This album marks a first for many reasons: first Coltrane recorded for Atlantic, first where all of the tracks are his compositions, and the first where his \\"sheets of sound\\" phrasing was prominent (it was not new, but came to the forefront with this album.)  In a way, Coltrane is finally 'discovered' on this album because he is neither in the shadows of Miles, nor is he displaying his abilities on standards and compositions of others.<br /><br />Everyone - every jazz aficionado and all musicians regardless of genre - should own this album. It broke new ground when it was released in January of 1960, and continues to this day to exert a major influence on musicians as well as listeners.<br /><br />I could blather on about changes and progressions, but that does not describe the music to the non-musician listener who has every right to enjoy this album on its own merits without some snob implying that its too sophisticated. The samples on this page give a hint, but that should be all you need to make a purchase decision. For musicians I highly recommend augmenting with album with [[ASIN:1562240536 Giant Steps: A Player's Guide To Coltrane's Harmony for ALL Instrumentalists]]. For Everyone else, I recommend purchasing it without further thought.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is much then one of those 'find the hidden object in a picture' game. You actually have to use your head. The story. line I admit isn't completely there but I still loved playing it and the graphics are out of this world.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|This watch is very frustrating.  The touch bezel has a mind of it's own if you do sports that require flexing wrist (SUP, pushups etc).  Locking the bezel is an option, but is hard to engage while in GPS mode, you normally end up turning off your timer.  I have had to do complete resets at times when the watch is rendered completely unusable.  The spring that holds to the charger broke after 5 months of use and is a pretty cheap solution considering the cost of this watch.  I love to have the feature of GPS and tracking my distance in land and water in multiple sports but it doesn't come without its frustration.  I would not recommend this watch
B00005YW4H|3.0|My favorite song in this album was \\"Come Away With Me\\" - that was the specific reason for the purchase.  The song was one of the best that Jones has ever done.  The rest of the music is mediocre.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it mostly because it has lots of different games to chose from and its a good way to pass time.
B00018D44U|3.0|Good - not great music collection.  Jones' voice is sometimes compelling and sensual, sometimes just weak.  I probably would not buy this CD again.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|pretty good so far but it does get a bit hard into the game but worth the challenge so download!
B007V9YF5E|1.0|Boring, music weird, awful, story line haywire, Truly bad except for a couple scenes.<br />Entire movie a dud! Will put you to sleep.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|this game is fustraying to figure out is very limited and is crape the other 5 star reviews r fake dnt listen save ur money on something better
B004SOR4H6|5.0|deleted &uuml;bersocial for kindle fire for this.. much easier to use.. &uuml;.s. had tiiiiny icons hard to tap even on a tablet. twitter app is just much better all around.. I run two accounts on mine as well. BIG +!!
B000066744|5.0|This is one of those European movies that were not marketed in the U.S. market properly, thus was not seen by many viewers when it was first released. Writen and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore from Italy with an American and English based cast of actors, it's cinematography, superb acting and beautifully scripted storyline, its an intelligent film that leaves you spellbound.<br /><br />I read numerous reviews on Amazon with regards to this film before buying it, and as one customer previously wrote...\\"I remember having a guest over one evening who was seeing it for the very first time. His reaction (after wiping a tear from his eye) was to exclaim \\"what a wonderful movie! How did anyone even get a film that quirky made?\\" There is no Hollywood 'formula' to this film. It proceeds without any of the usual conventions: no good guy vs. bad guy struggles, no sex, no violence, and no crude jokes. It is like that really good book that you start reading one night when it is already too late but are unable to put down until you have turned the last page\\"... So in summary: It is that good!
0763644765|5.0|My 22 month old loves this book! She continually brings it to us to read to her. She also loves to read it on the potty. The book is very simple, but it does the job.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|There's a lot to like about the [[ASIN:B000KKPN5C Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash]]. It may be small and compact, but that's where the beauty of this small wonder starts. It's the beginning, entry-level unit of the Nikon Creative Lighting System (CLS), and though limited in many functions that the larger Nikon Speedlights offer, such as the SB-700 or flagship SB-910, this unit make up for it in size and surprisingly good results for an on-camera accessory flash unit.<br /><br />If you look at the product description, this SB-400 is listed as being made \\"for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras\\" but there's more to it than that: it also works quite with the [[ASIN:B005IGVXJS Nikon Coolpix P7100]] along with a number of other Nikon digital cameras, as verified on Nikon's website.  I've personally used it with my P7100 and D5000, along with the aging D200, and the performance has been excellent with each of these, primarily because of the i-TTL mode. The SB-400 was made to work with contemporary Nikon DSLRs made since 2004.  It's small and it's not cheap, but its performance is surprising.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Excellent construction quality; the SB-400 has a metal hot shoe<br />* Uses just two AA cells; excellent battery life<br />* Fast recycling, about 2 ½ seconds<br />* Shooting range 2 ft. up to 66 ft.<br />* i-TTL fill-flash with CLS-compatible cameras<br />* Bounce capabilities: 4 steps, to 90 degrees<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* No sideward head tilt<br /><br />In Use:<br /><br />The first thing that you'll note about the SB-400 when unboxed is the precision feel to the unit. I was surprised to see that it had a metal hot shoe, as so many flashes today have gone to plastic.  There's also a lock lever on the rear, and it has indicators so that you'll know if you forgot to lock it.  There's an excellent little zippered soft case that will store your flash and keep it from getting dinged up in your camera bag.  The flash uses only two AA batteries that can be purchased almost anywhere, and though I'm not carefully measuring it, I get about 200 flashes per pair of batteries.  I'm getting a recycle time of just over 2 ½ seconds with a pair of Sanyo eneloop Ni-MH 2000 mAH rechargeable batteries.<br /><br />The tilt head is excellent, and if you're using your Nikon in horizontal (landscape) mode, it offers four vertical positions of 0, 60, 75 and 90 degrees.  But if you're holding your camera in the vertical (portrait) mode, then you'll have to shoot with the flash straight on or bounced off of a wall.  It's a tilt head, and doesn't have a swivel head like the more costly Nikon SB-700 offers.<br /><br />The angle of coverage on the SB-400 is 18mm (DX-format) and 27mm (FX-format).  For reference, this is the equivalent of about a 28mm lens on 35mm film camera.  The flash coverage is excellent and generally well distributed.  Tinting the head for a bounce effect will give you a softer effect, but if you need more, using a bounce card or the [[ASIN:B000PH1DL8 OM-400 Omni-Bounce Flash Diffuser for Nikon SB-400]] will work, and there are similar devices.<br /><br />Suggestion:<br /><br />For many, the SB-400 may be all that's needed as an excellent step upwards for Nikon DSLR owners who need more than their built-in flash offers, but some may be perhaps looking for more.  As stated earlier, this flash is the beginning, entry-level unit of the Nikon Creative Lighting System (CLS).  It supplements my aged Nikon SB-600 in that respect, but in truth I use the SB-400 far more on a day-in, day-out basis.  For those wishing to explore Nikon CLS and what can be done with it, I might suggest the [[ASIN:1118022238 Nikon Creative Lighting System Digital Field Guide]] by photographer Benjamin Edwards.  This well-written guide offers an excellent overview of the creative control of flash at the photographer's command, and with Nikon's Creative Lighting System, flash control can be almost instinctive, and the possibilities can be endless and limited to the users own creativity.  And there are enough creative tips, along with excellent full-color images and diagrams that can make use of the SB-400 even easier to understand.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The Nikon SB-400 is an unpretentious, high-quality flash with all the features that many will actually use.  But do you actually need one of these, considering that the built-in flash on contemporary Nikon DSLRs (and the P7100) are so good?  Maybe not, but consider the SB-400 if you want an easy-to-use bounce flash, if you want faster recycle times than your camera may offer, and excellent coverage with your ultra-wide lenses.  You'll also get more shots per camera battery charge, since your camera's built-in flash uses 2-4 times as much power; using the SB-400 means you don't use the built-in flash. Other flash features can be gimmicks that may even interfere with taking pictures, and will slow you down rather than get the job done.  Considering all that this small wonder does, it's a 5-star recommendation.<br /><br />5/6/2012ted to the users own creativity.

B005EGXTEE|5.0|This book makes me want to go to bed at night for a reading session. Very well written and takes you on a journey that you will want to keep going back to. Definitely worth every cent.
B007K3JCAE|2.0|Guy Ritchie's take on Sherlock Holmes is fast becoming formulaic.  All the elements are there to make it entertaining - but as in the first installment, this escapade isn't very thrilling.  Sherlock Holmes has been reinvented to become this zen taichi master with an uncanny sixth sense (watch the Chinese film HERO to see where Ritchie got his inspiration).  Which is fine for a moment, but then becomes the entire formula for every action sequence in the film.  Stop.  Rewind.  Flashback.  Explain how Sherlock anticipated / fixed something so that the \\"threat\\" to him/Watson/everyone else has been cleverly defused.  Assassins; bullets from guns; exploding trains - everything gets the same deconstruction, I-told-you-so treatment.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, superbly casted and styled, witty repartee - Sherlock Holmes is just lacking in one critical area: Suspense. It would be nice to have a plot that at least gives more of a homage to the original sleuthing of Holmes.  He's become a parody or mutation of the original idea - which is fine, but Ritchie and team could do better plot-wise.  All smoke and bluster and little to show for it.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan should be doing Sherlock Holmes...it needs a lot more danger and less posing.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It was great and lots of fun until my timers started resetting.  Now I'm waiting 105 hours for this, 244 hours for that. It takes away from game play. At first I tried repurchasing buildings but that really isn't a permanent solution. Creators, please fix it ASAP!
B0073U2F2Q|3.0|The United States is known for creating their fair share of alien invasion films but this time around, with producer and filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov (\\"Wanted\\", \\"Night Watch\\", \\"Day Watch\\", \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\") involved, his goal was to create a Russian alien invasion film through a perspective by Russians.<br /><br />But to make it a global film and with only a budget of $30 million, Bekmabetov would enlist Chris Gorak (art director for films such as \\"Minority Report\\", \\"Fight Club\\", \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\") to direct and Scott Kevan (\\"Underworld: Awakening\\", \\"The Losers\\", \\"Fame\\") as cinematographer and the film woud utilize Bekmabetov's studio and filming would take place in Moscow.<br /><br />The film would star American talent Emile Hirsch (\\"Milk\\", \\"Into the Wild\\", \\"Speed Racer\\"), Olivia Thirlby (\\"The Wackness\\", \\"Juno\\", \\"No Strings Attached\\"), Max Minghella (\\"The Social Network\\", \\"The Ides of March\\"), Rachael Taylor (\\"Transformers\\", \\"Shutter\\", \\"Bottle Shock\\"), Joel Kinnaman (\\"The Killing\\", \\"Easy Money\\", \\"Safe House\\") and Russian talents Veronika Ozerova and Dato Bakhtadze (\\"Wanted\\", \\"Crash\\").<br /><br />\\"The Darkest Hour\\" would earn $64 million in the box office and is now available on 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Darkest Hour\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The cinematography definitely showcases the beautiful structures of Moscow, there is a good amount of detail when it comes to structures, clothing and because of the CG extra-terrestrials emitting this glowing orange, there are times of beautiful vibrant colors and for the most part, a good balance of digital cinematography with CG effects.<br /><br />Black levels are nice and deep, skin tones look natural and I did not detect any banding or artifacts during my viewing of the film.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Darkest Hour\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Espanol Dolby Digital 5.1.  When it comes to audio, although this is not directed by Timur Bekmambetov, because it was produced by him, you expect a lot of action scenes and immersive audio.<br /><br />The film utilizes the surround channels and LFE throughout the film, may it be the music and its bass, the sounds of disintegration courtesy of the aliens or even the many machine guns or shots at the aliens to the collapse of structures, the biggest positive of this film will be its lossless audio track.<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Espanol.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"The Darkest Hour\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Survivors - (8:10) A short film showcasing survivors from different countries using radio broadcasts from Tokyo in destroying the aliens.<br />  The Darkest Hour: Visualizing an Invasion - (12:09) A featurette about the visual effects of \\"The Darkest Hour\\".<br />  Deleted and Extended Scenes - (4:48) Six deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary by director Chris Gorak.<br />  Audio Commentary - Director Chris Gorak talks about the cast, shooting in Moscow, using CG the challenges involved in the making of the film due to the Russian Wildfires of 2010.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"The Darkest Hour: Special Edition\\" comes with a slipcover.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />As a sci-fi fan, especially fan of alien infestation films, there have been films that captures the horror of an alien infestation, may it be the 1996 film \\"Independence Day\\" or the 2011 film \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\", part of the reason why these films succeed is the use of star power and a large budget dedicated to the films visual effects.<br /><br />While there are alien infestation films that have been shot in a low budget and without star power such as the exciting 2011 UK film \\"Attack the Block\\", at least the pacing of the film was consistent, it was funny and it was going somewhere.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"The Darkest Hour\\" doesn't seem to be goinganywhere and the characters don't grab you at all.<br /><br />Part of the challenge that filmmaker Chris Gorak and Timur Bekmambelov had when making this film were scheduling delays (due to the Russian Wildfires), a budget of $30 million and the lack of major star power.  While Emile Hirsch has received attention for his roles in \\"Milk\\" and \\"Into the Wild\\", unlike American alien infestation films with American bravado, this Russian film focused on survival of weak Americans who survived thanks to the Russian people.<br /><br />The film is supposed to be a Russian perspective, a Russian version of an alien infestation film and while I didn't mind the weakness and whining of the American characters, the film had forced dialogue that made things seem too unnatural and thus produced spotty acting.<br /><br />But where the screenplay fails the viewer is that the storyline and its characters are not really going anywhere.  It's a survival film that seems more like \\"Cloverfield\\"-Lite and because the characters are not so captivating, you just wonder to yourself of \\"how they will die?\\".<br /><br />There are also some problematic issues such as a blast that throws Sean and Natalie, who were standing next to each other, could have kept everyone within the same vicinity but for Natalie, somehow she has ended a half mile away.  There are scenes that showcase the relationship between Natalie and Anne and why they went to Moscow.  There are times you think the two are hiding something but yet nothing is ever mentioned.<br /><br />Where the film does work well in a Russian perspective is showcasing the beautiful structures of Moscow, showing the CG devastation of Moscow, showing Russian heroes who will do what the can to help these Americans get to safety. If anything, the Russian characters seem to be much more intriguing and personally, \\"The Darkest Hour\\" could have been a much more enticing film if it was a full-on Russian alien infestation film utilizing an all Russian cast.  It's one of the things that I have loved about Timur Bekmambetov's \\"Night Watch\\" and \\"Day Watch\\" films, it's Russian sci-fi with Russian talent.  It seemed more plausible, much more exciting.<br /><br />But I can understand the producers wanting to make their money back by making this film more International by using an American cast with English dialogue.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, \\"The Darkest Hour\\" no doubt looks wonderful on Blu-ray and the lossless soundtrack is fantastic!  There are a few special features including the short story \\"The Darkest Hour: Survivors\\", showcasing people of other countries fighting against the aliens.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Darkest Hour\\" is a popcorn alien infestation film with uninteresting characters, spotty acting and lackadaisical pacing.  There was too much sacrifice into making this film set in Russia to appeal to an American or International audience that the film would have been best being an all Russian film, as the characters and the us vs. them storyline would seem much more plausible and exciting.<br /><br />While I can recommend this film to those who love alien infestation films, it's simply not one of the better alien infestation films to be released in the U.S.anywhere and the characters don't grab you at all.<br /><br />Part of the challenge that filmmaker Chris Gorak and Timur Bekmambelov had when making this film were scheduling delays (due to the Russian Wildfires), a budget of $30 million and the lack of major star power.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|The British Dramas and Romances are my favorites.  The Brits know how to bring these period pieces to the screen like no one else can.

B0072GPQ72|5.0|In 1982, Michael Morpurgo wrote the children's fiction novel \\"War Horse\\", a story set during the outbreak of World War I.<br /><br />The book received its film adaptation courtesy of filmmaker Steven Spielberg and screenwriters Lee Hall and Richard Curtis and was released in theaters on Christmas day of 2011 and would earn over $173 million in the box office and in April 2012, the film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD.<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" would reunite Steven Spielberg with the top talents in the film industry such as cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (\\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Schindler's List\\", \\"Minority Report\\"), editor Michael Kahn (\\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Schindler's List\\", \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\"), sound designer Gary Rydstrom (\\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Minority Report\\", \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\") and also reunited Spielberg with legendary composer John Williams (known for creating the soundtracks for the \\"Star Wars\\" films and \\"Harry Potter\\" films).<br /><br />The film marks a new beginning for Steven Spielberg.  One, this is the first film in which Spielberg directed a film about a horse as the main character and portraying him at various stages of the horse's life.  The film also marks Spielberg's first time cutting the film digitally.<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" would go on to earn six Academy Award nominations including \\"Best Picture\\" and would win the American Film Institute Award for \\"Film of the Year 2011'.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:40:1).  When Steven Spielberg brought in cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, you get one of the best in the business.  A man who knows how to capture the shot and in this case, to capture the beauty of Dartmoor but also to capture the essence of peace and serenity via pre-war but also the darkness and fear during the war.  There are wonderful, breathtaking shots that are seen throughout the film with vibrant colors to lush greenery of the area.<br /><br />There is also wonderful detail when it comes to the closeups of the horses and black levels were nice and deep.  I didn't catch any banding, artifacts or any problems with the overall video.  If anything, picture quality for \\"War Horse\\" is outstanding!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHZ/24-bit), French 7.1 DTS-HD HR and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  Dialogue is crystal clear and there is amazing use of the surround channels.  From the beginning as Joey is plowing the field to the use of music courtesy of John Williams.  But the film shows how wonderful it could sound via lossless once we get to the war.<br /><br />As one would expect from a film with war scenes, the film is absolutely immersive as you hear machine guns, tanks, cavalries and their horses marching and stomping to bomb blasts via LFE.  There is good use of the rear surround channels and panning through the surround channels and I was quite impressed by how the overall mix was.  \\"War Horse\\" has an amazing lossless soundtrack!<br /><br />Also, the musical soundtrack is wonderful.  The music is inspired by the serenity of the British landscapes and manages to capture that feel of adventure but also the horse as it goes through its adventures.  John Williams approach was to utilize brass instruments.<br /><br />The brass is the key to the music of \\"War Horse\\", creating emotion and feeling of the horse trough the ages.  Steven Spielberg said in the booklet notes of William's composition, \\"I feel that John has made a special gift to me of this music, which was inspired not only by my film but also by my many of the picturesque settings of the poet William Wordsworth, whose vivid descriptions of the British landscape inspired much of what you're going to hear.  I'm not sure what I can give John in return, other than a promise of more films to come...for as many more years as we both can imagine!\\".<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  War Horse: The Journey Home - (19:35) Featuring interviews with Steven Spielberg and the cast and a second roundtable interview with the creative team and crew.<br />  An Extra's Point of View - (3:06) A featurette about extra Martin D. Dew and his involvement in the film.<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />  A Filmmaking Journal - (1:04:13) A more in-depth featurette on the screen adaptation of \\"War Horse\\", the casting and shooting on location.<br />  Editing & Scoring - (8:53) Editor Michael Kahn and composer John Williams discuss their involvement with \\"War Horse\\" and their longtime collaboration with Steven Spielberg.<br />  The Sounds of War Horse - (7:13) Gary Rydstrom talks about the sounds of \\"War Horse\\" and his goal to make the film sound authentic.<br />  Through the Producer's Lens - (4:04) Producer Kathleen Kennedy talks about the photos she took on location during the filming of \\"War Horse\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" comes with a slipcover case, two Blu-rays (one for the film and the other for the special features), the DVD version of the film and a digital copy of the feature film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" is a film that captures the human spirit but most of all, Steven Spielberg ability to capture the relationship and emotions may it be an animal to an extra-terrestrial, it's one thing that Spielberg has been wonderful in doing.<br /><br />We have seen Spielberg create a heartfelt film with \\"E.T.\\", we have seen him recently capture human and animal relationships through adventures with \\"The Adventures of Tin Tin\\", but \\"War Horse\\" is a challenge that the filmmaker was ready to take on.<br /><br />How would you be able to create a film based on a horse?  It's one thing to get the actors to be emotional and caring towards a horse but you have to capture the horse being interested as the actions must seem natural to the viewer.  And sure enough, with amazing trainers, the reactions by Joey the horse as it goes through a lot during its adventures is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" is no doubt a collaborative film.  In order to make this film work, you would need a wonderful location, wonderful cinematography, costume and set design, music, sound design and talent and many extras in order to create this sense of dire during World War I.  Characters who come across the horse Joey and eventually are touched by it.  And of course, the trainers responsible in making the horse meet its mark (there are possibly over a hundred of horses used in this film, especially during the war scenes).<br /><br />For one, \\"War Horse\\" is a gorgeous film.  Spielberg brought in his top guns for this film, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and editor Michael Kahn.  They have had a long working relationship with Spielberg and part of the believability of this film is its look.  From the peaceful pre-war landscapes to the muddy trenches during World War I.  You have the cinematography and editing there, you have the look courtesy of Lee Sandales on set decoration and Joanna Johnston via costume design.  Every soldier on opposing sides have a uniform and you eventually get the sense of how grand this film is.<br /><br />And of course, when it comes to emotion, to help tie the characters to Joey, you have the wonderful music of John Williams.  And also the sound courtesy of sound designer Gary Rydstrom is absolute amazing.  If you are an audiophile, you will literally hear how immersive this lossless soundtrack truly is on Blu-ray.  It's one of the best lossless soundtracks that I have heard on Blu!<br /><br />For the most part, everything came together for this film and I was quite impressed.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, the video and audio is absolutely magnificent.  There are many special features as well on two Blu-ray discs and you also get the DVD and digital copy version of the film with the 4-disc combo pack.<br /><br />Overall, \\"War Horse\\" is a beautiful, moving and wonderful film capturing a horse and its ability to bring out the human spirit with the many people it comes across.  While it may not be as emotional as Robert Bresson's 1966 film \\"Au hasard Balthazar\\" nor do we see the cruelty the horse must go through from owner to owner, the film is not about the cruelty of man towards horse.  Nor is \\"War Horse\\" a war film.  It's about a horse that brings out the human spirit no matter who the owner is or whatever side the horse is being utilized.  The hope of one young man being reunited with his horse and that hope and even a bit of luck exists, even during dire circumstances.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg and his crew once again has done a wonderful job and for those contemplating on this Blu-ray release, it really is magnificent.  Not just the film itself but its presentation, its picture quality and its fantastic lossless soundtrack.<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" is highly recommended!ed as the actions must seem natural to the viewer.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool Omnibus is the best thing I have read this year. It is not just a good story, it is a well written good story. All too often authors try to tell a good story with crap writing. It is also true that there are well written books that have drab and boring stories. Wool is awesome. The best of both worlds. Literary fiction that doesn't put you to sleep. Science fiction that doesn't kill your brain cells.    Rarely have I approached the end of a book with such sadness. Not because the story was sad, but because I didn't want it to end, like the final days of a great vacation. I even ordered an autographed copy of Wool, not just for posterity, but as an investment. I think it will be worth something someday. It is that good. I am now converted, a Hugh Howey fan. Read his books, check out his blog, [...], and support this great new voice in fiction.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|It all began back in 1954.<br /><br />A high school student named Jim Henson was working at WTOP-TV and creating puppets for a children's show known as \\"The Junior Morning Show\\".  Henson would continue making puppets as a Freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park as the teenager would go on to create the financially successful show \\"Sam and Friends\\" for WRC-TV.  The five minute show would feature a prototype of a character known as \\"Kermit the Frog\\".<br /><br />This would lead to Henson working on a public television children's shown known as \\"Sesame Street\\" in the late '60s where Kermit the Frog would appear as a news reporter.<br /><br />This would lead to Jim Henson creating a British/American television show known as \\"The Muppets\\" which premiered in 1976 and a total of five series were produced until March 1981 and lasting 120 episodes.  The show known for its parodies and slapstick would feature many celebrity guests and through the series, Jim Henson and Frank Oz would create additional characters to join Kermit the Frog such as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Scooter, Gonzo, the Swedish Chef, Rowlf the Dog, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Beaker, the band Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, Camilla the Chicken, Sam the Eagle, Statler and Waldorf, Link Hogthrob, Rizzo the Rat and many more.<br /><br />Although the television series ended, \\"The Muppets\\" would continue in the big screen with \\"The Muppet Movie\\" (1979), \\"The Great Muppet Caper\\" (1981), \\"The Muppets Take Manhattan\\" (1984), \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\" (1992), \\"Muppet Treasure Island\\" (1996) and \\"Muppets from Space\\" (1999).<br /><br />While a musical telefilm was created in 2005 titled \\"The Muppets' Wizard of Oz\\", the masses have not seen \\"The Muppets\\" for a long time and the last film was back in 1999.  Many have felt the characters have run its course and it was over, while others felt that without Jim Henson (who passed away in 1990), it would be difficult to continue \\"The Muppets\\" legacy.<br /><br />In 2008, actor Jason Segel (\\"How I Met Your Mother\\", \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\") and writer/filmmaker Nicholas Stoller (\\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\", \\"Get Him to the Greek\\", \\"Yes Man\\") wanted to bring back the Muppets and so the two pitched the concept to Walt Disney and next thing you know, the film would be greenlighted and filmmaker James Bobin (\\"The Flight of the Conchords\\", \\"Da Ali G Show\\") would directed, while Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller would be responsible for writing (Segel would also star in the film).<br /><br />Cast alongside Jason Segel would be Amy Adams (\\"The Fighter\\", \\"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian\\", \\"Julie & Julia\\", \\"Enchanted\\") and Chris Cooper (\\"American Beauty\\", \\"The Bourne Identity\\", \\"Adaptation\\") as the antagonist.  The film would also feature talents such as Jack Black, Rashida Jones, Alan Arkin, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, Jim PArsons, Kristen Schaal, Eddie Pepitone, Sarah Silverman, Donald Glover, Emily Blunt, Leslie Feist, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patric Harris, Judd Hirsch, Kohn Krasinski, Mickey Rooney and more.<br /><br />The film would receive positive reviews from film critics and would be a success at the box office making over $158 million.  And now, \\"The Muppets\\" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in March 2012.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Muppets\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The film looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray.  You can literally see the detail in the fur of the Muppets, to the skin pores of the human talent.  The clarity, the detail and the beautiful colors featured throughout the film are vibrant and because the film utilizes a lot of color, reds and greens really do pop.  Skintones are natural and black levels are nice and deep.<br /><br />I didn't see any banding or artifacts, if anything, videophiles should be happy with the overall picture quality is flawless!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />I absolutely love how Disney is focusing on 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtracks.  As expected from this film that utilizes so much music, dialogue and music is crystal clear coming through the center and front channels.  There is good use of surround channels as well from the audience of the live show to the music being utilized.<br /><br />The soundtrack is absolutely immersive, especially panning from varying sides coming from the surround channels (especially during the fireworks scene). Also, the LFE is used during scenes of accidents and there is also a good amount of ambiance that utilizes the surround channels as well.  I was pretty impressed as even when the scenes are shown backstage, you can then hear the audience still in the background from the rear or surround channels, you can hear the flickering of the lights to even when one gets on the stage.<br /><br />Like the video, audiophiles will enjoy this lossless soundtrack because it is equally flawless and no hissing or any audio problems were detected at all.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"The Three Musketeers\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Disney Intermission - Groundbreaking Blu-ray feature. Pausing a movie will never be this much fun, as the Muppets take over the screen every time you stop the disc!  Whenever you pause, you get an intermission with music, audio from the Muppets, or the Muppets themselves showing up on screen or even a theater like look at the special features.<br />  Scratching The Surface: A Hasty Examination of the Making of Disney's \\"The Muppets.\\" - (15:56) Hosted by unit production manager monster J.G., the cast and crew take a behind the scenes look at making Muppet and movie history.<br />  The Longest Blooper Reel Ever Made (In Muppet History--We Think) - (8:33) Featuring funny gaffs and gags from behind the scenes of making Disney's \\"The Muppets.\\"<br />  A Little Screen Test on the way to the Read Through. - (3:19) This hilarious footage follows the Muppet gang as they go to their first table reading of the script.<br />  Explaining Evil: The Full Tex Richman Song -(2:38) This is the longer rap sequence featuring Tex Richman which goes into details of why he dislikes the Muppets.<br />  Deleted Scenes - (10:01) Featuring eight deleted scenes: \\"Walter's Nightmare,\\" \\"Life's A Happy Song Missing Verse,\\" \\"A Hero in Hollywood,\\" \\"Credit Card Club,\\" \\"Muppets in Jail,\\" \\"Bowling for Beaker,\\" \\"The Strip Mall Awards\\" and \\"The Complete Muppet Telethon Opening & More\\".<br />  Theatrical Spoof Trailers - (9:00) Featuring seven spoof trailers: \\"Rise of the Muppets,\\" \\"Never\\" \\"Green with Envy,\\" \\"The Fuzzy Pack,\\" \\"Being Green,\\" \\"The Piggy with the Froggy Tattoo\\" and \\"Green with Envy, the Spoof Spoof Trailer.\\"<br />  Audio Commentary with Jason Segel, James Bobin and Nicholas Stoller - A not-so-serious audio commentary by Jason Segel (executive producer/co-writer/actor , executive producer/co-writer Nicholas Stoller and director James Bobin.  The three discuss the movie but also joke around a lot during the commentary as well.  It would have been great to feature another commentary track with the puppeteers and crew, to give a more in-depth commentary on the making of the film.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack\\" comes with a Blu-ray, DVD version of the film, Digital Copy and a code to download the film's soundtrack online.

In fact, back in junior high and my earlier years of high school, watching the show every Monday through Friday was like an addictive ritual before heading off to school.<br /><br />But like many children who grew up with \\"The Muppets\\", I got older and \\"The Muppets\\" became nothing more but a memory of my childhood and early teenage years.<br /><br />So, when I first heard of \\"The Muppets\\" making a return to the big screen and that Jason Segel and Nick Stoller were involved in rejuvenating the franchise, I have to admit that I was a bit of a skeptic.<br /><br />In today's society, Saturday and Sunday morning children shows are a rarity, even during the afternoons, you can't find anything.  Today's children to young adult series have been replaced by real characters and if there was any form of puppetry, it has long since disappeared from television and video games and the Internet have now become sources for children's entertainment.<br /><br />\\"The Muppets\\" have become nothing more but a memory for those of us who were able to watch the series while younger.  So, I had no idea what I would think about the film.  Especially having seen a variety of shows that I grew up with such as \\"The Transformers\\", \\"G.I. Joe\\", \\"The Smurfs\\" all receiving movie adaptations, \\"The Muppets\\"...how can they attract today's audience?<br /><br />So, I watched this film with my nine-year-old son.  His familiarity with Kermit the Frog would probably be from our Christmas ritual of watching \\"Emmet Otter's Jugband Christmas\\" (and due to licensing, Kermit the Frog has since been removed from later DVD releases) but together we watched and I was touched by the storyline of Walter.<br /><br />The character represents the child inside many of us who grew up and was captivated by these characters, but unlike Walter, I stopped watching the series and for the last 20-years, I forgot about them.<br /><br />So, I was touched by seeing the character of Walter wanting to reunite the Muppets but also captivated once again by the camaraderie and the music.  From the opening song of \\"The Muppet Theme\\" and even hearing \\"Rainbow Connection\\", I had nothing but a smile on my face because it was like returning to the days of my youth.  I admit, I probably laughed much more than my child because of my familiarity with the characters but we both enjoyed this film immensely and the additional cameos also added to the excitement.<br /><br />Also, Jason Segeland Amy Adams brought a warmth to this film that was enjoyable, humorous and so much fun!  Sure, the musical segments may seem corny to some, but in the sense of how things relate to \\"The Muppets\\" and the quirkiness and craziness of the show, the musical numbers were perfect.  In fact, I have to say that I really enjoyed the music and the overall soundtrack.  For me, having grown up with the film, just to hear \\"Rainbow Connection\\" was quite sentimental as I have not heard Kermit the Frog sing that song since I was a child.<br /><br />Also, another positive that I found with this film is that it's a childrens film that doesn't have to utilize the latest in technology.<br /><br />In this day and age of CG graphics and technology, despite the characters being puppets, each character still retains their personality and watching them today, it still hasn't grown old to me.  I've read that Pixar helped out in the storyline department, and if that is indeed the case, you do get some of that Pixar-style sentimental scenes included in the film.  From brotherly relationships, dysfunctional relationships and of course, those who may have wondered what happened between Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy is featured in this film.<br /><br />And while Jim Henson is no longer with us, nor is Frank Oz involved in voicing the characters any longer,  it does help that the voices today don't sound too different from the original voices.  Eric Jacobson, David Goelz, Bill Barretta, David Rudman and Matt Vogel do a wonderful job with the voice acting for this film.<br /><br />But everything came together for this film, a script that touches upon nostalgia but also an appealing, captivating story for the young and old and a wonderful film that will entertain the multiple generations who experienced \\"The Muppets\\" on television and film.<br /><br />As for this Blu-ray release of \\"The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack\\", you get a Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy plus a downloadable soundtrack.  But for Blu-ray enthusiasts, this film looks absolutely fantastic in HD, and the immersive lossless audio soundtrack is equally impressive.  This is a magnificent Blu-ray release if you are fans of \\"The Muppets\\".<br /><br />Overall, \\"The  Muppets\\" is a film that I enjoyed a lot.  For so long my friends have told me to watch it, but part of me rolled my eyes and felt, it was a part of my life a long time ago and I don't know if I can get into talking puppets ever again.  I was wrong.<br /><br />I watched this film with my son and we both enjoyed it a lot.  For him, it was because of its crazy characters, the crazy antics and storyline.  For me, deep inside...I was happy because I can easily remember those times of watching \\"The Muppets\\" everyday and it was one thing for me to enjoy this as a child, but now to enjoy it as a father with my children and knowing friends who are also sharing it with their children or grandchildren makes me happy, because it's one thing from our past that a newer generation of fans can enjoy.<br /><br />\\"The Muppets\\" was definitely a crazy, entertaining and fun film.  The musical elements, the characters and the overall storyline worked perfectly.  Was there anything I didn't like?  Not really, but aside from the quacking chickens to the music of Cee Lo Green's \\"Forget You\\", I felt the film was entertaining and fun!  Granted, It all depends on one's appreciation for \\"The Muppets\\", otherwise if you never liked them to begin with, not sure if that's going to change your opinion today.<br /><br />While I don't know what will happen to \\"The Muppets\\" from here on in, I will say that the James Bobin, Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller got this film right.  Looking back at the past Muppets films, a lot of them were kitsch and really going downhill.  Because the familiarity of the Muppets are primarily with its older viewers, Segel and Stoller realize that, as they are fans themselves and wanted a film that can appeal to both young and old, like Pixar films.  And they succeeded.<br /><br />So for those who are wondering about this film, what I can tell you is that \\"The Muppets\\" is a fantastic family film that the younger generation and the older fans can really appreciate. And with this awesome Blu-ray release with wonderful PQ, AQ which is bundled with plenty of enjoyable special features (plus the Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy) plus an entertaining soundtrack, makes the \\"The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack\\" release worth owning.<br /><br />\\"The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack\\" is highly recommended!ick Stoller were involved in rejuvenating the franchise, I have to admit that I was a bit of a skeptic.<br /><br />In today's society, Saturday and Sunday morning children shows are a rarity, even during the afternoons, you can't find anything.

From the opening song of \\"The Muppet Theme\\" and even hearing \\"Rainbow Connection\\", I had nothing but a smile on my face because it was like returning to the days of my youth.  I admit, I probably laughed much more than my child because of my familiarity with the characters but we both enjoyed this film immensely and the additional cameos also added to the excitement.<br /><br />Also, Jason Segeland Amy Adams brought a warmth to this film that was enjoyable, humorous and so much fun!  Sure, the musical segments may seem corny to some, but in the sense of how things relate to \\"The Muppets\\" and the quirkiness and craziness of the show, the musical numbers were perfect.  In fact, I have to say that I really enjoyed the music and the overall soundtrack.  For me, having grown up with the film, just to hear \\"Rainbow Connection\\" was quite sentimental as I have not heard Kermit the Frog sing that song since I was a child.<br /><br />Also, another positive that I found with this film is that it's a childrens film that doesn't have to utilize the latest in technology.<br /><br />In this day and age of CG graphics and technology, despite the characters being puppets, each character still retains their personality and watching them today, it still hasn't grown old to me.  I've read that Pixar helped out in the storyline department, and if that is indeed the case, you do get some of that Pixar-style sentimental scenes included in the film.  From brotherly relationships, dysfunctional relationships and of course, those who may have wondered what happened between Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy is featured in this film.<br /><br />And while Jim Henson is no longer with us, nor is Frank Oz involved in voicing the characters any longer,  it does help that the voices today don't sound too different from the original voices.  Eric Jacobson, David Goelz, Bill Barretta, David Rudman and Matt Vogel do a wonderful job with the voice acting for this film.<br /><br />But everything came together for this film, a script that touches upon nostalgia but also an appealing, captivating story for the young and old and a wonderful film that will entertain the multiple generations who experienced \\"The Muppets\\" on television and film.<br /><br />As for this Blu-ray release of \\"The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack\\", you get a Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy plus a downloadable soundtrack.  Butfor Blu-ray enthusiasts, this film looks absolutely fantastic in HD, and the immersive lossless audio soundtrack is equally impressive.  This is a magnificent Blu-ray release if you are fans of \\"The Muppets\\".<br /><br />Overall, \\"The  Muppets\\" is a film that I enjoyed a lot.  For so long my friends have told me to watch it, but part of me rolled my eyes and felt, it was a part of my life a long time ago and I don't know if I can get into talking puppets ever again.  I was wrong.<br /><br />I watched this film with my son and we both enjoyed it a lot.  For him, it was because of its crazy characters, the crazy antics and storyline.  For me, deep inside...I was happy because I can easily remember those times of watching \\"The Muppets\\" everyday and it was one thing for me to enjoy this as a child, but now to enjoy it as a father with my children and knowing friends who are also sharing it with their children or grandchildren makes me happy, because it's one thing from our past that a newer generation of fans can enjoy.<br /><br />\\"The Muppets\\" was definitely a crazy, entertaining and fun film.  The musical elements, the characters and the overall storyline worked perfectly.  Was there anything I didn't like?  Not really, but aside from the quacking chickens to the music of Cee Lo Green's \\"Forget You\\", I felt the film was entertaining and fun!  Granted, It all depends on one's appreciation for \\"The Muppets\\", otherwise if you never liked them to begin with, not sure if that's going to change your opinion today.<br /><br />While I don't know what will happen to \\"The Muppets\\" from here on in, I will say that the James Bobin, Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller got this film right.  Looking back at the past Muppets films, a lot of them were kitsch and really going downhill.  Because the familiarity of the Muppets are primarily with its older viewers, Segel and Stoller realize that, as they are fans themselves and wanted a film that can appeal to both young and old, like Pixar films.  And they succeeded.<br /><br />So for those who are wondering about this film, what I can tell you is that \\"The Muppets\\" is a fantastic family film that the younger generation and the older fans can really appreciate. And with this awesome Blu-ray release with wonderful PQ, AQ which is bundled with plenty of enjoyable special features (plus the Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy) plus an entertaining soundtrack, makes the \\"The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack\\" release worth owning.<br /><br />\\"The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack\\" is highly recommended!
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I began watching this movie. I hadn't seen any of the trailers or really knew anything about the plot except that it starred Rachel McAdams and Owen Wilson and was set in Paris. Already being a huge fan of the 20's, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and Hemingway, this movie was so much fun! The plot was anything but disappointing! I kept wanting Owen Wilson to go back into time and was excited to see the notorious characters he had already met and to see what other figures he would meet next. The element of irony is very present and is what ties the plot together. Aside from the storyline, the Paris scenery is beautiful and the cinematography and soundtrack fit perfectly with the tone of the movie. I loved this movie and found it to be very entertaining. It had a happy, satisfying ending. Not only do I want to visit Paris now, but I want to visit Paris in the 20's and meet Fitzgerald and Hemingway! Only in my dreams I suppose! I rented this movie from Redbox, and I loved it so much I am planning on buying it from Amazon.
B006P0FICE|4.0|Since the 1800's, the tale of \\"The Three Musketeers\\" has entertained generation after generation.<br /><br />Beginning with the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the 17th century tale would feature a young man named d'Artagnan leaving home to join the Musketters of the Guard which consisted of Athos, Porthos and Aramis.<br /><br />And within this last century, there have been musicals, films, games and animated TV series based on the characters featured in the novel.<br /><br />But as the story has been retold countless times, there was no doubt that the story of the Three Musketeers would receive a film adaptation and for filmmaker W.S. Anderson (\\"Death Race\\", \\"AVP: Aliens vs. Predator\\", \\"Resident Evil\\" films), in order for the story not too be to banal or boring, and attract a new generation of viewers, it was time to change things up by tweeking the storyline and also modernizing it.<br /><br />And so, screenwriters Alex Litvak (\\"Predators\\") and Andrew Davies (\\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\", \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\") would be responsible in giving audiences a new fresh storyline featuring the Three Musketeers and the characters created by Alexandre Dumas.<br /><br />The 2011 film would feature cinematography by Glen MacPherson (\\"Rambo\\", \\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\") and music by Paul Haslinger (\\"Underworld: Awakening\\", \\"Death Race 2', \\"Crank\\").  And while this big budget film would utilize modern technology for CG, Paul W.S. Anderson also wanted realism and that was to create actual sets of the airships, to shoot in Bavaria for its use of French and Italian architecture and also for its talent to undergo swordfighting bootcamp.<br /><br />The film would earn over $135 million in the box office worldwide and now the film will be released on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Summit Entertainment in March 2012.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Three Musketeers\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and as one would expect for a big budget action film, the film looks absolutely beautiful.  For one, there are a lot of vibrant colors featured in the outdoor scenes, but it's the location of shooting in Bavaria that lends to the film feeling it's 17th Century and most importantly, CG that helps compliment in the recreation of that world.<br /><br />The production and set design, along with costume design is magnificent and on HD, you are able to see the detail of the clothing, to the sparks flying when the metal swords are striking each other and also seeing the clarity and detail of the surroundings of the area. The CG work is quite impressive and for the most part, this is a vibrant and well-detailed film.<br /><br />I didn't notice any edge enhancement, artifacts or banding while watching this film.  Colors are vibrant, black levels are nice and deep and overall, this film looks beautiful on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Three Musketeers\\" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Espanol Dolby Digital 5.1.<br /><br />As one can expect from an action film, not only do you get immersive sound during the action sequences, the music composed by Paul Haslinger sounds wonderful.  First, the action sequences.  From the clanging of swords, cannon balls being shot from airship to airship, explosions galore and wonderful panning from right to left, left to right.  And while the second half does feature most of that immersive sound during the action sequences, dialogue and music is crystal clear as well.<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English SDH.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"The Three Musketeers\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by director and producer Paul W.S. Anderson and two other producers as they dissect the film, why they modernized the film to what they were most impressed by the making of the film, finding the location and the performances by their talent but also what the crew was able to pull off.Overall, an in-depth and enjoyable audio commentary.<br />  Access: Three Musketeers - While watching the film, you can have access to \\"making of\\" videos, cast and crew info., factoids and also a body count meter.<br />  Paul W. S. Anderson's Musketeers - (2:29) Director Anderson talks about modernizing the film, location of where to shoot and more.<br />  Orlando Bloom: Takes on the Duke - (1:59) Orlando Bloom and Director Anderson talk about the character of Duke of Buckingham.<br />  17th Century Air Travel - (2:20) Director Paul W.S. Anderson talks about modernizing the air ships and having sets built rather than creating it all on CG.<br />  Uncovering France in Germany - (2:14) Shooting in Bavaria and why they chose the location.<br />  Deleted and Extended Scenes - (14:38) Featuring 12 extended and deleted scenes.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"The Three Musketeers\\" come with a slipcover case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"The Three Musketeers\\" have entertained generation after generation for over 150 years.<br /><br />But for those of us who grew up watching \\"The Three Musketeers\\" in cinema or cartoons, while the swashbuckling swordsman storylines were great decades ago, for this society use to immersive video game playing, big budget special effects and heroes that have a \\"cool factor\\", bringing \\"The Three Musketeers\\" to a new generation is rather tricky.<br /><br />Bring in director Paul W.S. Anderson, known for action films such as the \\"Resident Evil\\" films, \\"Death Race\\" and \\"AVP: Alien vs. Predator\\" and a person who is willing to modernize and give a refreshing perspective to the storyline but also targeting this new generation who may have passed on reading or watching anything that would have to do with \\"The Three Musketeers\\".<br /><br />And while listening to the audio commentary by Paul W.S. Anderson and him describing a scene which was inspired by the video game \\"Assassins Creed II\\", I knew immediately that he's going after an audience who loves their popcorn action, an audience who loves special effects and of course, having the beautiful Milla Jovovich in another action role does not hurt at all.<br /><br />But with that being said, Anderson is known for popcorn action films and in no way or form was he going to recreate the films that were made in the past.  This was going to be straight-up action like his previous films and for those who are familiar with his work, you know what you're going to get.<br /><br />First the positives.  What I enjoyed about \\"The Three Musketeers\\" was the fact that Paul W.S. Anderson wanted to make D'Artagnan as he was in the original book, an older teenager.  I also liked the fact that he shot in Bavaria and instead of sets created or CG buildings, we are seeing the actual architecture of long ago featured in a film.  Granted, to recreate popular buildings in Paris, there was CG used but still, there is no denying that this film looks good, from its design, set design and even the costume design.<br /><br />Another positive is the fact that Anderson wanted to achieve realism by having the talent undergo bootcamp and learn how to use a sword.  This went for several months and it shows in the film.  Another is building sets, especially the airships and then using CG when needed, but not use CG to completely build the airships.  So, that was a positive touch.<br /><br />Also, the characters seem rather fun, especially having Orlando Bloom and Milla Jovovich as the antagonists.  It was great to see everyone also belittle the servant Planchet and if anything, this was a good popcorn action film that delivered in action and special effects.<br /><br />The bad news which may be bad for those familiar with the series is that this is not the same Three Musketeers that many people grew up with.  While the Three Musketeers are featured in the film, this is a story primarily focused on D'Artagnan and some may feel the ego and bravado was a bit too overbearing.<br /><br />Some mayalso roll their eyes of the modernization of the film.  With people battling with airships, yes...17th century wooden ships that are flying in the sky with blimps using Leonardo da Vinci's blueprints.<br /><br />And last, a storyline that is driven to action scene after action scene while the storyline is there, it's more to boost its action sequences.  Swordfights, airship fights, etc.<br /><br />And for those who want a cinematic experience with strong characters with awesome character development and a deep, intellectual storyline, this film is not it.  Once again, look at Paul W. S. Anderson's oeuvre and you know that he is a director that specializes in action films and he rarely deviates from that.<br /><br />I personally have enjoyed Anderson's \\"Resident Evil\\" films and I usually know what I'm going to get with his films and with \\"The Three Musketeers\\", it was what I expected, a popcorn action film set in the 17th century with modernization and plenty of action and I enjoyed it to the point where I hope there is a sequel.  I never came to this film expecting anything deep or cerebral because I was familiar with Anderson's work and in a sense, his storyline does play to a new generation of audiences who enjoy popcorn action films with plenty of special effects and fighting such as \\"The Pirates of the Last Caribbean\\", \\"Resident Evil\\", \\"Alien vs. Predator\\", \\"Transformers\\", etc.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is fantastic.  Colors are vibrant, detail is amazing and the film looks great on Blu-ray and I can say the same about the lossless audio. Great use of panning of audio from the surround channels, plenty of immersive action sequences that fill up the soundscape and dialogue and music is crystal clear.  And also you get plenty of special features, although I tend to not like \\"making of\\" being offered by watching the movie a second time.  I prefer to have these separated.  But it is subjective and that is my own personal preference.<br /><br />Is it keeper?  One may want to rent it first to see if it's for them, but for those who enjoy Paul W.S. Anderson films or action films in general, it may be an action film they may want to have in their Blu-ray collection.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Three Musketeers\\" is an action-packed film that features impressive special effects, wonderful costume set design and a fast-paced storyline.  It's definitely not the same \\"Three Musketeers\\" that many have grew up with in the past but a modernized, reboot of the characters for a new generation of moviegoers who love popcorn action films.loves their popcorn action, an audience who loves special effects and of course, having the beautiful Milla Jovovich in another action role does not hurt at all.<br /><br />But with that being said, Anderson is known for popcorn action films and in no way or form was he going to recreate the films that were made in the past.

B0079R8KXG|5.0|This cover feels so soft like good leather.  And the Fire installs very easily and securely.  It also holds it at the right angle for reading.  I had my screen locked in the wrong position and it took me a minute to realize I had to unlock it, adjust the position and then relock.  But it was easy to do.<br /><br />If you want a holder that looks and feels nice, and adds little bulk or weight, give this a try.  I like it much better than the one I had before.

1449305172|5.0|I obtained a review copy of Running Lean from OReilly, and this is one of the most interesting and useful books I have read in a while. I had a software consulting business for 17 years and stumbled upon a few of Maurya's ideas in the literature on Lean. Now I am writing two books, one commercial software product, and recording a library of eLearning videos. I have already enlisted all of Maurya's recommendations. Starting with fielding your concept and sharing your Minimum Marketable Features is central to Agile software development where you a) deliver value and b) obtain feedback. His Lean Canvas appeals to me in its economy: one sheet of paper with just the essential ideas. Again, in Agile we strive to \\"do the simplest thing possible\\". As a techie like Maurya my first impulse has been toward the technology, but as a business person I know the technology is not the goal: value for my customers is the goal. Running Lean is one of the most succinct statements I have found of how to find the right value that I should be creating for my customers. Thank you, Ash for an advanced book that makes being an entrepreneur and techie a whole lot simpler.

B004EPYZV2|4.0|The Blu-ray edition on MI: Ghost Protocol is a visual spectacle.  It takes a fantastic and well executed film and makes it look and sound as spectacular as it did in the theater.  IMHO, this is the best installment of the series.  MI 1 was good, not great, especially wiith its destruction of the Jim Phelps character.  MI 2 was the better of the films with the less convoluted plot, tighter storyline and great action.  MI 3 was the weakest ans what I thought would be the final entry in the seriers.  Thankfully, Cruise and his production company decided otherwise.<br /><br />Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, and finds himself paired with a new team of operatives as he tries to prevent global nuclear war.  The action sequences are top notch, and Cruise handles the part well.  He sells Hunt and the issues that drive him convincingly. This story is also the best in terms of well rounded and fully developed stories.  Cruise also displays an easy chemistry with his new team, particularly Paula Patton.  If there is a fifth installment tot the franchise, which Cruise is still young enough to effectively pull off, I hope the new team and Ving Rhames are on board.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Am hooked on this series, a great read.  The way each chapter is based on a certain character keeps you wanting to read more and more.
0545403359|3.0|War Horse is about World War I according to Joey, a literary, contemplative horse. The anthropomorphism itself is rather amusing. The horsey details are minimal. The horse's relationships with other horses and humans are sweet. His emotions--from friendship to fear--are touching. His eloquence rubs off on the humans who cross his path, such as a farm-boy-turned-soldier, who exclaims at the sight of another gorgeous horse, \\"There's a nobility in his eye, a regal serenity about him.\\" (!) The same is true of the main horse-character's wisdom: anyone who strokes his nose--poof! turns into a philosopher. The whole cast is bent on speech making and rather good at it, if you like long-winded speeches. The book does a good job showing that there are good people on all sides of a war, but not as good a job showing that there are people of all types out there (including kind or mean).<br /><br />Yet this is a pleasant, quick read with an old-fashioned feel.

0345803485|2.0|I guess this book was ok. Really, it's trying too hard to follow a Twilight-style character archetype list. You have the creepily controlling, stalker-like male lead, and the boring, almost too ordinary to be believed, pseudo-strong female lead who falls head over heels for the tortured soul. The only thing missing is the supernatural element. This is all understandable, I suppose, given that this began as Twilight fanfic. It's not extremely well written. The writer does what too many amateur writers do, and simply throws in a whole slew of large, obscure words that sound intelligent, to mask the fact that the whole story is lacking. I truly wish that writers would learn that using a thesaurus does not make you a great writer. If you are writing for the masses, then you should be using words that people could stand at least a snowball's chance in hell of encountering in the real world. I'm not saying a person would necessarily need a dictionary to read this, it's just that the strange word choice (coupled with the Stephenie Meyer signature style of OVER descriptive writing) makes the whole story seem strange, and even less believable than it would already be.
0345803485|1.0|I'm not a big fan of \\"romance\\" novels (I hope this book isn't the new definition of romance) ... but was hitting the beach for a week and decided to try something a bit new.  Exceptional marketing is what is selling this book, and that's all.  If reading about a physically and emotionally abusive, mentally deranged man (who is, of course, a billionaire) who is incapable of any type of meaningful attachment to humans is your bag, this is your book.  And if that blockhead girl that dated him (using the term \\"dated\\" loosely) bit her lip one more time in one of the fifty shades of crappy pensive moments in this book .... argh .... I didn't make it through this book.  I got to the second act of physical beating and quickly went to the last chapter to find out if the chick would finally get a brain and leave this relationship.  Then I left the book on the beach for birds to make a nest out of.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|One of the best MI movies to date. Good story line and lots and lots of action. Worth waiting for.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Hey you know what? That new Van Halen album kicks ass.<br />I came into this expecting to find washed up rock and roll pop and found a sound explosion. I can only say \\"wow!\\" It's about time. All the songs are fast paced but not monotonous. The lyrics are fun and inventive (updated for the middle-aged with lines about soccer moms and housewives), and Eddie's guitar has become more refined, with better phrasing and more variety of tone. David Lee is clearly pushing his range but in a way, that's good because his voice has a gravely tone now that adds some depth to the passages where he talks. Alex still bangs away, and Wolfgang easily holds his own with Michael Anthony.<br />There are no slow songs on this album. There is none of the cheese pop of 1984 or OU812. All of the songs are headbangers, and there's only one I don't listen to -- won't say which.  Occasionally the band sounds like Judas Priest, Motorhead, and other incarnations of itself with Hagar. Favorite songs: outta space and honeybabysweetiedoll (love the dog bark!)<br />I say this album is up there with the first album, maybe better. Yes I did say better, and I realize I border on sacrilege in saying so, but consider that the person writing this review was 13 when the first album came out and last saw the band live back in 1980. He's earned his VH merit badge.<br />I keep trying not to like this album and keep finding myself referring to song lyrics or humming riffs, so it must be good.  How come no airplay or promotion?
0307165485|5.0|Usually my 4 year-old only goes toward \\"all-boy\\" books ... anything with cute animals or families just doesn't cut it. But he really enjoys this book, even the stories that I think he would normally not tolerate, perhaps because most are super-short and there is usually an element of humor and/or sarcasm in them (eg., \\"would we feed Hilda Hippo a table?\\" etc). I hope he continues to enjoy it as he gets older and learns to read, because there are so many good word-learning opportunities throughout the book. Lots of different stories, interactive activities, etc. Never a dull moment. It is interesting to see the influence of the 70's, however (papa smoking a pipe in several stories, record players, telephone booth -- none of which my son could recognize, lol!) Highly recommend. I may actually get rid of about 10-20 of his other books that we hardly ever read and are just taking up space, since this one covers so much ground.
0345803485|1.0|Ug. Where to begin...<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book. I am in my early-forties, educated, and was looking for a little something spicy to read when I heard some brouhaha about this book. Unfortunately, this book is almost unreadable. The writing is burdened with an excessive use of adjectives, rendering it ineffective and trite. The lead character, Ana, is un-relateable if you are the least bit empowered yourself. I know she is inexperienced at the beginning, but her lack of self-awareness and naiveté are annoying. To then have the writer make her \\"successful\\" on her first romantic experience is ridiculous and actually serves to disempower women readers. The male protagonist is one dimensional being a \\"powerful, yet wounded\\" billionaire, pretty boy-type. The whole story makes me cringe. So disappointed I spent money on this book. Blech!<br /><br />To be fair, I am not a romance book reader. I thought this was a piece of popular fiction that was also a little bit racy. So, perhaps if you enjoy romance novels, you may enjoy this book.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Fast paced and works great on the Kindle Fire. Takes a bit of thought if you want high scores but you can also go less quickly if scoring isn't important to you. Great fun!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I've tried several. of the town/builder/zoo games and this one is the best of them. it contains in game ways to earn the prime stuff through mini games.  Many of the builder games you get stuck with no way to get the good stuff without spending lots (and i mean Lots) of real money which I refuse to do.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am sure that everyone reading this review has also read \\"Hunger Games\\" and I am pleased to say that \\"Catching Fire\\" is a worth sequel. While I did not find it is a fast paced as \\"Hunger Games\\" it does replace some of the action for intrigue.<br /><br />Now that Katniss has won the74th annual Hunger Games her life becomes easier, but not necessarily better. Her relationship with both Gale and Peeta has become much more complicated, but now she has an entire nation following her romance. President Snow makes an appearance and lets it be known that he needs Katniss to go along with the program. From there... things only get worse.<br /><br />I found \\"Catching Fire\\" to be a bit more sophisticated than the Hunger Games, and to some extent it can be read without having read \\"Hunger Games\\" (although it is not something that I would recommend). However, it certainly needs to be read with \\"Mockingjay\\" since the two books are completely dependent on each other. This may be biggest criticism, since these two books should have been combined into one, longer, novel.<br /><br /> I mentioned this in my review of \\"Hunger Games\\", but I think it deserved mentioning again, Collins writing has received some criticism for being too simplistic and having overly contrived dialogue. I think this is unfair. Collins writing may not approach Rowling's skills, but she is far from being a hack. What Collins may lack in terms of literary skill she make up for in pacing and the ability to pull the reader into a story that seems realistic. In this way she reminds a little of Jules Verne.<br /><br />Final Verdict - While I preferred \\"Hunger Games\\" I can say that \\"Catching Fire\\" is a worthy sequel that will leave very few fans disappointed.<br /><br />4 Stars
B006LEHOL2|4.0|Sinead O'Connor has a one of the best most versatile voices ever: she can sweetly sing a warm love song and then spew bile with equal aplomb - sometimes in the same song, no less.  While nearly all of Sinead's albums have their moments, she seems to put out a great one every ten years. Easily her best since 2000's \\"Faith and Courage,\\" \\"How About I Be Me\\" allows Sinead to crucify the Catholic Church, Reality TV, and, best of all, an errant Lover. She also has gentler moments  - especially in \\"The Wolf is Getting Married,\\" one of the best songs on the album. The soaring backing vocals and Sinead's impeccable lead vocal recalls the excellent \\"Hold Back the Night\\" from \\"Faith and Courage.\\" Even better is \\"Queen of Denmark,\\" which Sinead turns into a 5 minute exorcism, complete with profanity and crashing guitar chords. Though this is a cover song, it was made to be sung by Sinead.

No bullsh-- this song is a throwback but oddly enough it's very 'today'as in the same way mariah carey's vision of love was when it hit the airwaves back in 1990.Thier harmonies are on point and a melody that you will find creeping up on you out of nowhere through out the day.You see THAT's WHY GOD MADE THE BEACH BOYS so that they can give us the gift of beautiful music!
1455510319|4.0|OK, I got taken for a ride in the Lincoln this time.  I so did not see the ending.  But, said ending<br />was cool and good.  I really enjoyed the book with the intricate characters and the excellent story.  As always, the story makes the book and this one is very good.  In fact, I'm not sure that the book should not be 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|variety of games. some easy others hard. fun for anyone! even better, its free! a must download for anyone who loves games!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book!!! I felt like I was on the journey with the author!!! Such memorable characters..<br />Definitely one of my favorite books!!! I want to watch the movie but I'm afraid it won't be nearly as great<br />as the book!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game. easy to play. only problem I am having is it wont update. keep the updates coming.
B005MMJ84K|3.0|I love a good series.  I love following characters on their journey and seeing them develop.  When I first started reading Delirium I wasn't completely sold on it.  But the more I read the more I got sucked in!  So I was really looking forward to the second book of this series and man I was disappointed.  Lena was pretty annoying in this one.  She just seemed so whiny.  I guess I expected that since she had been through this crazy, life-altering experience she wouldn't be your typical whiny teenager and she was.  And the love \\"twist\\"?  Not so twisty.  Saw that coming a mile away.  And I hate when that happens.  However the ending was great!  Definitely did not anticipate that plot twist!  So while I didn't hate this book, I didn't love it either.  I'm just hoping the third book will be as good as the first.
0765324857|4.0|Wow this is cool! The story is a prequel to the videogames ([[ASIN:B000VKC6LU BioShock Xbox 360]], [[ASIN:B0016BVYA2 Bioshock 2]]). The games are great, and I recommend playing both of them BEFORE reading this book.<br /><br />If you've played the games it's very interesting to see the origins of Rapture and how the characters came to vie for power in their utopia beneath the sea. It's such an interesting world, and to read about its decline is captivating. Why not listen to the soundtrack at the same time ([[ASIN:B003MOJAGQ Official BioShock Soundtrack: I Am Rapture, Rapture is Me]])? Makes me want to play the games all over again!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have nothing snarky to say here.  I loved this book.  Is it the best written book?  No.  Do I care?  Nope.  Read the entire series in under a week and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Of course I also love the Twilight series so maybe that is why.  I had never read a book like this (erotica) and probably won't again but this one for me is a keeper.
B001TODOCM|5.0|Intimate knowledge of The Three Musketeers is a major prerequisite before you can enjoy this book. It's referenced all over the place, along with mentions of Moby Dick and other swashbuckling stories of the time. If you are familiar with such things I don't see how you could help but love this modern mystery.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games was a quick and entertaining read. The author takes you to The Games giving you the stress of actually being in them. While the first book is captivating,  the bigger struggle between The Capitol and The Districts doesn't get going until book 2 and 3 of this trilogy. Even though the original audience was a younger age group, it's no surprise that all generations are getting into it.
159102594X|4.0|I really enjoyed reading The First Law trilogy and getting to know the characters created by Joe Abercromie.  I admit that when I began to read The Blade Itself, it took a couple of chapters for me to become absorbed by the story, but I appreciated JA's writing style and wit and found the Bloody Nine to be as interesting a barbarian as I had ever encountered.  Logen is a hero... for the most part.  He is feared by many, he is practical and amusing, he is intuitive and he is a relatively decent man.  He is also deeply flawed and at war with himself, as many of us are, so one may relate to him as he experiences both triumphs and tragedies.<br /><br />The story itself provided enough action and intrigue to keep me entertained and interested in what might come next.  I found myself cheering for and supporting different characters at various times, disliking most of them at one point or another, then resuming my cheering at a later point.  I appreciated the fact that not every story arc was obvious and easily predicted, and that the main characters weren't perfect, but they each showed growth throughout the series.  I liked that most of the characters were alternately fascinating or repulsive.  I loved Glokta's sarcasm and sadism, West's intelligence and noble attitude towards' things HE felt were noble, Ferro's ferocity and Bayaz's twisted and manipulative nature.<br /><br />Of course, there were a few things I didn't like.  For example, I wasn't a big fan of the Logen/Ferro \\"romance\\".  It seemed bizarre and awkward, at best.  I liked them individually, but when they were together in any way besides as warriors, I found it annoying.  I didn't like that at the beginning of the series I had no idea what the heck was going on and couldn't read comfortably for around 100 pages.  I wasn't impressed with some aspects of the story that seemed to drag, ie: The Contest, wherein Jezal and other swordsmen compete for a title.  However, I really don't feel that these issues detracted much, if at all, from the trilogy as a whole.<br /><br />I definitely liked the way in which the series ended, as there are many directions that JA can take the story if he chooses to continue writing about these characters.  I'm glad that he didn't write himself into a corner when ending the trilogy.<br /><br />All in all, I thought that the First Law was enjoyable and creative.  It is not fantasy a la Jordan or GRRM (as well it shouldn't be); it is unique and gives the genre a little push in an interesting direction.  I recommend all three books.
B0018D4SHY|5.0|I found myself singing along with most of the songs on this CD.  It will be a CD that I will be glad to have in my collection.  I would recommend that if you are into the history of rock and roll, that you should purchase this CD.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am rereading all three books again for a thrid time. I enjoy the story between Christain and Ana. When i first read the book i never once thought of Twilight. I think they are a like in some ways but that the storys are different. I like how these charactors grow and learn from each other.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|When I listened to it, I was not disappointed in it.  I got one special surprise with it though, the CD changed its look after it was played. It was the first time I have ever seen this happen with a CD and was quite amazed.  I cannot wait to get another Black Keys CD.
B0055SWM08|1.0|Not useful to me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome book!!! It's utterly amazing! I found my self going through the entire set in a week...Unfortunately, I had to work, otherwise I would have finished them sooner! :0P
B000HB2DR0|5.0|The use of language - word choice, sentence construction, metaphor - is to be savored.  As a record of the deterioration of a privileged and powerful class, it is a compelling history.  Reading the story now, seventy years later, it offers a cautionary view of a class - antagonist, at the time, to privilege - that began its vibrant rise in the 1930s and, in its turn, has become privileged, unadaptive, and precarious.  The television production of the early 1980s - available on DVD - is rich, compelling, and among the great dramatizations of a novel.  In both reading the novel and in viewing the television production, \\"A Companion to Evelyn Waugh's Bridesherad Revisited\\" by David Cliffe, available on the web, is greatly illuminating.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great. in stead of buying a whole bunch of games on your kindle you can have them in one.
B00799L3OM|5.0|Some old and new songs.  Smaller group of musicians.  But still great to listen to and relax. Love it. Has a few words songs. I will continue to buy everything ihe puts outs, and go to every concert I possible can.

B005HSL626|4.0|Fruit Ninjas Free is an awesome app. Sometimes, though, the screen turns black and I have to exit out and get back on. Also, for some reason, I can't open Feint. All in all, great app and I reccomend it.

B0040ZPLBY|5.0|For anyone who was wondering, the person responsible for putting up a preview image of the current British TV series Merlin apparently put up an image from another Merlin TV movie / miniseries. But the episodes themselves are the correct ones from the current TV series, and all other information associated with each episode is correct as well.
B005FITIGO|5.0|A financial company is set to sell to customers who did not realize they were buying junk. This would cause the whole country to go into a stock market crash. Great acting to portray individuals annually making 6 to 8 figures with severance packages in the millions. There are a few moments where the financiers reminisce about when they used to actually make things (bridges, airplanes). They realize that with their new job, they are just inventing financial products that produce nothing except money for Wall Street.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I really enjoyed this game until it went bad.  Come on people you know what the problems are.  Its very irresponsible to put faulty games out there.  Please fix so I can give this game a 5.  I certainly would hope you're taking steps to correct the issues.

So good I bought a second one for a friend who had been picking up tips off of the internet.  After reading the book he modified his approach to his Aquaponics set-up.  If you are interested in Aquaponics this book is an awesome help to get you moving in a successful direction.

0345803493|1.0|I read all 3 of these books mainly because I bought all 3 at once, (big mistake!) oh and my inner goddess agrees with me on this... I just couldn't get into this book mainly because the main character Ana was just an awful lead I found her to be very immature, pathetic and just mousy. She wonders why Christian loved her so much... Well so did I! Christian seemed well enough at first, but then he became bi-polar and extremly jealous and over protective to the point of stalking, but Ana forgave him everytime he was her messed up 50 her poor baby... right any guy who did that kind of stuff to me we wouldn't be together anymore, on the other hand maybe if he was a hot billionaire I might change my mind. The same things are on repeat like the blushing/flushing, eye rolling, the oh my's and holys. And the sex is just the same pretty much everytime, it kinda bugs me that Ana refers to her female anatomy as DOWN THERE & He cupped my SEX! I mean really? Just call it a P*ssy ok?<br /><br />I wrote another review on this book and someone who also read the book told me that I was wrong in my thinking this book was garbage, well I am sorry but when you compare it to the classics, even new books like The Help and The Hunger Games this book is garbage. She also told me that this book helped spice up her marriage and that it was a story about Love, acceptence, forgiveness and blah, blah umm? did I read the same story as this reviewer? Because I didn't really get that vibe.. Did anyone else? Also any man who essentially dates/sleeps with women who all resemble his crack whore dead mother and then marries a woman who looks like all his subs is really creepy! I dont know about you, but that is a Hard limit for me or a deal breaker! Hey if you liked Twilight you might dig this too its like Twilight on Viagra! I wouldn't pay $30 bucks though! You have been warned!
B007549YM4|5.0|Xavier Gens does it again, this film is awesome. Very dark and depressing. Solid performances all around. I recommend this!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was my first purchase for a book using the Kindle App on my iPad.  The book itself was a great read and compelling story.  It was easy to read in the app, with easy to use features such as bookmarks.
B0006B3UEQ|1.0|Sorry I can't review this product.  It was designed for another region; not the United States.  It wouldn't play.  These manufacturers of dvds need to start putting the region on their labels.  I don't know what to do with it.
B0050JN88M|5.0|Decent concert and the only one with Tommy Bolin actually on video. Too bad his arm was messed up as he only seems to be able to play bar chords. The extras are nice but its kind of sad overall. A great video nonetheless.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire when I'm bored or if I don't know what to do! I reccomand you get it!
0345803485|1.0|I heard this book referred to as \\"porn for women\\" so I was expecting something very hot and explicit.  My expectations were not met.  To me, this book was no more explicit than a typical Jackie Collins novel, and the story wasn't even as involving.  Plus the ending was lame and chopped off.<br /><br />Worse yet, the Kindle price is higher than the regular book price.  What is up with that?
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Short enough to consume over the Easter weekend. Thoroughly enjoyed the escape to the future and the stark contrasts between the Capitol and The Zones. Interesting array of characters and relationships. As soon as I finished book 1, I downloaded the next two!
B003VB5E2E|5.0|This purchase was worth every penny. Definitely the best show we've ever seen. The picture, sound, meeting. Wow! Incredible!<br />If you are thinking of enjoying a good presentation with phenomenal musicians, do not miss this experience.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Insomniacs rejoice!!!  Better than those PM medications that are OTC (over the counter).  Not only can you play up to 3 different sounds at once, you can vary their levels independantly!!!!  And by plugging your phone/tablet into a speaker(home theater or portable system) you can fill the whole room with the sounds you want/need to fall asleep. The quality of the sound are good--better than what i expected at the listed price.  The part that I like the best is that it helps me fall back to sleep quikely after i have to use the bathroom or letting the dogs out, or whatever woke me up in the middle of the night/day.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book against my better judgement because of all the hype.  Big mistake, learn from me, do not waste the purchase price.  If you want to kindle some romance in your life, spend that money on a cheap bottle of wine or a can of whipped cream, do not buy this tasteles, badly written excuse for a book. It's porn pure and simple and trust me, there is better written porn in the pages of the men's magazines.  The characters are shallow and one dimensional and entirely predictable in everything they say or do.  The plot is largely non existent.  It makes my blood boil to think of all the talented undiscovered authors in the world (and I am not one of them, in case you think this is sour grapes) while this author is making millions with this trash.  If I could have given it zero stars, I would have done. Do not buy it!!!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I waited a long time for this movie, and the pay-off was definitely worth it. I saw it 3 times at the theater. Measly words like 'epic' or 'awesome' are not even close to describing this brilliant film. This movie is jam-packed with action, explosions, fight scenes, and comedy. There is never a dull moment, and time just flies by during this 142 minute extravaganza. The agency of SHIELD accidentally use the Tesseract to open a mysterious portal and unleashes Thor's evil brother, Loki. Loki brainwashes Dr. Selvig and Hawkeye to help him bring his army, the Chitauri to Earth. Nick Fury assembles Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow and the Incredible Hulk to help stop him. Thor joins the group later. (Thor is my absolute favorite Avenger and he had some decent action scenes and funny moments. I wish he had a little more screen time) Tony Stark and Steve Rogers often clash with each other, but they must all work together to defeat Loki and become....THE AVENGERS!!!!!

Second, it's just like Super Mario Bros, and who doesn't. love Super Mario Bros on a kindle?!!! Last, the graphics and sound effects are adorable! Not to mention the jazzy techno music! I adore this app. It is addicting, fun, and has just the right difficulty level. Please buy this game; YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!
B006UIUJ2A|5.0|Riveting, unusual, spooky novel that stays with you while you're reading it and after. It's purpose and style changes as the story unfolds, but it remains fascinating to the end, and you would be a very jaded reader if you didn't find it fresh and exciting.

B000GCFY0I|5.0|I wasn't too sure about this book at first because I don't real a lot of dystopian books and things like that, mostly fantasy like Eragon and things. Joey Graceffa was the one who got me interested in them! I had a gift card from Easter and decided, why not buy it?<br /><br />When I started reading it, it was actually really interesting and I could hardly put it down! I just wanted to read all day in school! I would definitely recommend!
1451627289|5.0|Stephen King's newest novel, 11/22/63 was released in November of 2011 and debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Sellers list. It spent many weeks in the top 10 positions of this list and as of today it is being prepared as a paperback. This is the author's 50th novel and in my opinion one of his best works.<br /><br />For anyone who has never read a Stephen King book this would be a great book to start with. As with many of his novels, Stephen King uses this book to take a normal citizen, in this case a teacher, and throw them into unusual circumstances. The author captures the naivety of the character through his amazing gift of prose. While reading this book I was able to feel as though I was the protagonist of the story.<br /><br />Not only was this book a great example of Stephen King's fictional writing abilities but it was also the first time I have ever seen him take on historical facta in such depth. Being as a lot of the story takes place in the past, the author must have done a tremendous amount of research in order to capture that setting. Intertwined with the main story arc were many side stories that captured the feelings and emotions of the people of that era. For anyone that is interested in the history of the 1950s and 1960s and also likes a good story this book is a must read.<br /><br />As with many of Stephen King's books this one is packed with a lot of suspense. There are so many twists and turns that you are never sure if the protagonist will complete the task that he set out to accomplish. These twists are what make this book a compelling read for people of all ages. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to be engrossed in a very satisfying story.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Assemblage<br /><br />There have been many reviews written about The Avengers, the latest Marvel Comics/Disney film for 2012's first summer blockbuster!<br /><br />The film is really a sequel to several other films and though the film does a good job of catching up the audience, really seeing the other films first would really help - Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man and Thor.<br /><br />The film is part science fiction alien invasion, part team-making, part knock down drag out fights with Thor, Captain America, Iron Man and Hulk beating each other up, and the non-powered characters with issues of their own - Black Widow, who fakes being helpless to gather intel and Hawkeye, who has worked with B.W. on many occasions (this part of the film was a weakness - there was not enough expository reveal regarding their relationship - minor quibble).<br /><br />The best part of the film really is the writing.  I've always liked Josh Whedon's television programming from Buffy to Angel to Firefly to Dollhouse.  The snappy writing and silly banter was real, not forced.  The characters were real, too!<br /><br />Captain America, a man out of time.  I saw the first film and clearly Avengers was a sequel to Cap.  What happened after the big freeze?  What's his relationship with Nick Fury and SHIELD?<br /><br />Thor - his film ended with a Jane Foster crush and a beat-down by a very large villain, as well as an apparent loss into space by Loki.  Again, a sequel of sorts - Thor as I have imagined him, he is torn between a brother who kills indiscriminately (Thor:  \\"Loki's my brother.\\"  Widow:  \\"He's killed 80 people.\\"  Thor:  \\"He's adopted!\\") and has the sly deceptive character that the actor brings out so well.<br /><br />Philosophy:  Yeah, always some of that.  Loki prefers to think of Freedom as an aberration, that mankind was made to be ruled by strong rulers and gods.  Great scene of an old man, no doubt a Holocaust survivor, at the Stuttgart, Germany orchestra scene, where the man stands up against Loki - and Cap makes an appearance, makes a speech alluding to the Nazis, before beating up on Loki.<br /><br />Heroes and Villains:  As with other Marvel characters, you have to have some heroes with something to hide, some inner agenda.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My co-worker and I were reading the book at the same time and we couldn't put it down! We were racing to see who would finish first!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun and exciting.will play it until the end.cant wait to unlock the rest of the games at the end.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Been wearing the black Seiko 5 daily for 2 months now, I'm glad I made the purchase. gains around 30 seconds/week, not bad for a mechanical watch. It is worn about 12 hours/day and has never stopped at night. My daily job is not very active, mostly sitting in front of PC, but it's enough movement to keep it wound.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Concert: 5.0/5.0<br />The concert is great, they are excellent singers and entertainers. The concert is very entertaining, they have a short video segments between set changes and whatnot, if you a fan of One Direction this is a must have and they are excellent live singers. The thing I find most disappointing is that the concert is very short, the concert is about an hour and ten minutes long, I think it should be a bit longer maybe an hour and half with a few extra songs for the encore instead of the one, but anyways, it's a great concert and I can't wait to go see them perform live, if it's as amazing as it on the concert DVD.<br /><br />**DVD REVIEW**<br />This is a review on the DVD's video quality and audio quality.<br />VIDEO: 3.0/5.0<br />I honestly think the Video quality isn't great, I think it looks a bit fuzzy and it's not as good as it should be, but anyways, it's still very watchable.<br />AUDIO: 4.0/5.0<br />The DVD includes both 2.0 Stereo and 5.1 Surround, the 2.0 stereo sounds a bit funny in my opinion, but it's still clear. I prefer the 5.1 surround, it sounds excellent and is well balanced and the surround is excellent.<br /><br />DVD Overall Rating: 4.0/5.0<br /><br />***BLU-RAY REVIEW COMING SOON***

B0041OT9W6|5.0|This book was very very good. At first, when I heard about Hitler, I thought he was just some bad criminal guy. But now I know just how much he hurt Anne Frank, her family, and thousands of other Jews as well. I think the reason people like her diary was because: 1,  You can learn about how some of the Jews's lives were and 2, how honest Anne was in her entries. Although, at first, I didn't want to read Anne's diary, I am so glad that I did now. I don't particularly like reading in the diary format, but knowing that these entries were true, and that all of those things happened made it worth it.  I recommend that people actually read this, because it is such a great book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book and the other two books! So addicting!! I will say it is pretty erotic but it definitely gets your blood pumping and you cannot wait to find out what happens next!
B000JQUMPI|4.0|I really liked Little Women... the only problem was that in some parts the book got a little boring and wordy. I read this book as a school assignment, and had to read it in one week. I'm eleven, so it wasn't too hard to finish it before the due date ,but it was really good, and some of the parts in the book made it worth it. I liked Jo the best because she was really tomboyish, which was nice and different from all the other characters. For all of the people who read Little Women I recommend reading The Diary of Anne Frank, because it.... well, actually it doesn't  really have to do with Little Women at all. I guess it's just a really good book. The part I liked most in Little Women was when, at the end, everyone got married and was happy! Well, almost everyone. Beth didn't.
0345803485|4.0|Is the story compelling? Yes. Are the sex scenes hot? Yes. Should this be a bestseller? Probably not. As a reader, I loved the story, though the present tense can be a little jarring and I thank my Kindle every day for the dictionary feature because the author must have gotten bored and dragged out a thesaurus in some areas.<br /><br />As a writer myself, I can't get past some of the cardinal mistakes that are made. The repetition gets to be overbearing by chapter 3. She bites her lip, we get it. What else does she do? The descriptions in the bedroom are good, but it's hard to get a clear picture of anything else.<br /><br />Some of the other reviews are a little harsh, though. Some of the language is a little British - you can move past that. The character names aren't traditionally American - who cares. Christian would never fall for a girl like Ana - he's damaged and that's what makes the story interesting. By book 2, this is covered a little more as his issues are explored a little more.<br /><br />On that note, I'm heading into book 3 because the characters have captivated me. I don't buy Ana and her whole virgin-before-Christian lifestyle, but I moved past it. It's a good story, though it is not without it's flaws.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it has cool graphics and its realistic. poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poo poppy.

0439023513|5.0|This book was really a page-turner.  I found it hard to put down, and thought it was a perfect ending to a great series.
0345803485|5.0|This is one of those books that gets you into the story and the characters. An absolutely great read but definitely not one to read to the kiddies ;)
0345803485|1.0|What shocks me is that people think this is ok?  He manipulates a young inexperienced naive woman playing to her inexperience and desires and needs and then physically hits her.......um, how is this not abuse???????  Wrap it up in any package you want, but abuse and abusive controlling behavior of a Narcissist is still just what it is!  I get that consenting adults may do what they like, but this isn't two people of the same desire, rather a man manipulating and controlling a woman to get his way.  I had to put it down because once I got to the first spanking, I nearly had to throw up.  How can you read that and get turned on by it?  It's filth and why our country and world is falling around us the way it is!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was a great way to end the series.  Many twist and turns, so many that in my personal experience of reading my own thoughts and predictions got in the way of reading the book in a shorter amount of time - gets the reader emotionally involved!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This has been one of the best books I have read in a long time! I am a big animal advocate and lover. I have an amazing dog who I believe can truly understand things as Enzo did. This book was real, heartfelt, and it taught me as it will teach you that crappy things happen to great people but it is how one handles them works through them and overcomes them. But all this happens with the help of the one or ones that truly love you unconditionally and a lot of the times  they happen to not be human on the outside but have more love and soul on the inside than any human I have ever known! I recommend this book to everyone who needs an awakening that their life might truly not be as bad as they think, that yours or someone elses pet or animal truly has a soul and would give their all to the ones they love NO MATTER what! Now that is unconditional love! This book will bring you from joy and laughter, to anger and surprise, to tears and it might just might make you believe. I loved this book and I am sure that most if not all who read it will too! Enjoy! You will never look at your pet as a pet again. Why? Because they are not just a pet they are your family!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Well written. A fantastic follow-up to HG1 and a great introduction to HG3 (Mocking Jay) I know it was originally aimed at teens but it is a good book - makes you think and rethink every move made by every character and every word spoken or otherwise!
0142000655|5.0|I \\"discovered\\" Steinbeck at age 13, thanks to a great English teacher, but only now have I read this marvellous book.<br />His writing style, his humour, his pathos, his characters, his occasional philosophical asides, all combine to make a rivetting and superb novel. Ordinary and extraordinary people populate these pages, you will love them and you will hate them, you will laugh and you may cry.<br />If you like a good story - or stories, for there are many stories here - read this. You won't be disappointed.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Game of Thrones, Season 1, met all my expectations. Good and Evil clashing head on,treachery,lust,murder, mayhem and betrayal all played out by a superb cast--hey it was just politics just like today.
B005H0YP7W|3.0|Emeli Sande is an amazing songwriter, and a superb performer. Having seen and heard her on TV, I was anticipating a brilliant album. However, while most of the songs are outstanding, the production is unbelievably intrusive: the musical arrangements are excessively percussive and distracting.<br />I note that various producers were involved.<br />It seems as if each of the producers felt that they had to make a statement of their own on this album, rather than letting Emeli's wonderful songs speak for themselves.<br />\\"Heaven\\" and \\"My Kind Of Love\\" both suffer from over-production, while the very beautiful \\"Where I Sleep\\" has an intrusive bass drum which has been mixed far too loud; \\"Suitcase\\" and \\"Lifetime\\" are similar with busy, electronically-muffled rhythm sections.<br />\\"Next To Me\\" could have fallen into the same trap, but the arrangement is in fact superb; previously Emeli had sung this song on TV with no band, proving that this is a magnificent song no matter how it's performed.<br />I look forward to other artists and producers mining this album for some of it's great songs, but perhaps treating them with more sympathetic arrangements, and the respect they deserve.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show!!! The Hunky Nathan Fillion and the Sexy/Beautiful Stana Katic. These two have the kind of chemistry I haven't seen on Television in a very long time.  But, I don't think the show would be where it is without the two leads. I don't think I would watch the show if Nathan or Stana wasn't in it...They are that good.  I don't mean to take anything away from the supporting cast because they are excellent as well.  I Love Lanie, Esposito, Ryan, Alexis, and of course Mama Castle,lol. They all play there rolls perfectly. If you've never seen \\"Castle\\" start with Season 1 and watch their journey...yes, at times it has been frustrating,irritating...but patience will prevail! I'm a major \\"Caskett\\" Shipper and I am sooooooo ready for their hookup!

B0079XNWQA|4.0|I am a great fan of Jason. However, I was a bit let down by this release. Does this descent into mediocrity happen to all Grammy winners? This album is missing the fun of Mr. A-Z and the artistry of We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things. As a side note, I found the theme of the album to be a bit depressing... yes we have all had our ups and downs in our personal lives, but I have always looked to Jason for happy, cheerful and uplifting tunes!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK.  IN FACT I WENT AND BOUGHT THE SECOND IN THE SERIES RIGHT AFTER I FINISHED THIS BOOK.  GREAT READING
B006OAB3ME|3.0|I was holding off buying this cd because it's not really my type of music.  I am a Beatles & a Paul McCartney fan, so I eventually gave in.  It will be one of my least played McCartney albums.  Diana Krall's band is in top form and Paul's voice is mellow and good.  Perhaps when I have some 'older' friends over, I will put this on as background music.  Let's see if anyone asks who it is.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I hate that this series is done.  It was the best book/series I've read in a long, long time, maybe ever.  I even created a file on my Kindle called KEEPER BOOKS and these are the only ones in it after having read over two hundred books on my Kindle.  Kudos to the author for creating such a memorable story/characters and giving them a happy ending!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Why would the publisher think that EVERYONE would want to see on line dating ads?  All of the ads between every game are just plain annoying, but the on line dating and others that require several clicks to get out of are ridiculous.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just have to say I loved this series.  After readng all the hype on this book/series, I purchased book one.  While it started off a little slow at first, I found myself drawn into this story to the point of not wanting to stop reading it.  I purchased and read all three books in this series within a week.  The author did a fantastic job creating characters I wanted to cheer on, smack in the head(or spank in this case), cry with, love, etc.  I am so thrilled the movie rights have been purchased for this story.
0345803485|4.0|Here is the bottom line: this is not some well written, destined to be a classic book. It is a very quick read that is sometimes tedious in the repetitive sex but still entertaining. Yes we all know that Ana is not going to have fifty mind blowing Big O's in a row but you stick with it because you want to see how it turns out.<br /><br />It's a little hot and a lot silly but who cares! Everyone needs to stop being literary snobs and just enjoy the book for what it is.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two was every bit as good as the first.  I kept on reading, anxious to see where the main characters ended up and wasn't disappointed.  Sexy, but emotional as well.  Love this series!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|First, I am not sure why I'm even writing a review on a book that has over 2k opinions. Second, I really should rate Fifty Shades with 3 stars.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, Fifty Shades is in need of an editing pencil. And, yes, James is shockingly repetitive in her use of actions, non sequiters, and dialogue. She tries too hard to get her point across with repetitions of action and thought that the reader really gets -- and no reader wants to think that the writer believes them to be stupid. Take the beginning, when protagonist Ana Steele constantly refers to the antagonist, Christian Grey has a \\"control freak.\\" We got it the first time, Ms. James ... we especially get it because we know going in that Grey is a BSMD kind of lover. Each of these can be irritating, but they're also easily forgiven. You should already know that the strength of the book is hardly because it's highbrow fiction.<br /><br />Fifty Shades is a compulsive read. No Tess of the D'Urbervilles to be sure (which is definitely NOT a compulsive read), but the novel is is fast-paced and easy to read. I flipped the pages quickly in anticipation of what would come next. (Um, no ... that would not be for the naughty bits, but the progression of the story and character development. The naughty bits, I must say, appear too often and aren't particularly interesting ... it's really kind of like reading a the letters in a well-known \\"gentleman') magazine. I began to ho-hum after the 3rd scene. There really are better devices to acknowledge a continuing passionate sexual relationship, and it doesn't have to be detailing each intimate moment. But this is James's weakness -- repetition, ad nauseum. Repeating word for word the \\"agreement\\" -- 3 times I think, was also a bit of overkill.)<br /><br />I *cared* about these characters. I was especially drawn in by Christian Grey ... why there are 50 shades of him. He is one of those enigmatic men: tender and kind, demanding, controlling, sweet, and totally messed up. I'm curious as to what makes him tick, and I hope that when I read the subsequent books, it's worth my time. Ana's own struggles to understand him are compelling, but in this, too, the stream-of-thought storytelling -- which isn't bad -- tells far too much than the narrative has already shown. Fifty Shades of Grade is strongly about the sexual awakening of a young woman and it does a decent job of working through it.<br /><br />Part of the book is written via emails between Ana and Christian. I found this to be clever and enjoyed what they would say to each other. While I would hardly call Fifty Shades funny or humorous, there is enough within the email and repartee between characters to bring on a smile or even a chuckle.<br /><br />Why the 5 stars, which I usually reserve for well-written literary fiction? Because, quite simply, Fifty Shades is like candy ... yummy, irresistible, and a complete escape from reality. While stylistically cumbersome, it's quite good enough.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The story which closely forms the plot for the beloved musical 'Le Mis'  \\"Les Miserables\\" now the longest running Musical in Broadway History, is extremely readable, the characters memorable, the plot and story of a man, torn down by his society, who refuses to give in, and spends a lifetime fulfilling a few promises; to God, to a dying woman, and mostly to himself is excellent.<br /><br />The sheer humanity this book reveals, of decisions that can haunt you for years, of persecution for and of living with those decisions is still as powerful now, as when first written. A must read for anyone who considers themselves compassionate, or well read. (Especially if you are going to see the musical.)

1423113381|4.0|***NOTE MY REVIEWS OFTEN CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />When Carter Kane arrives with his father to visit his sister Sadie in London, he expects it to be like any of the other one day visitations he has with his sister twice a year.  He doesn't expect to find himself at the British Museum watching his father blow up the Rosetta stone using magic Carter had never known existed.  However that's what occurs and it leaves Sadie and Carter with no one left but each other.  Deported from England they arrive in New York at the House of Life's 21st Nome in New York City and begin a journey neither of them could have ever imagine.  Set, an Egyptian god that neither believed before was real wants to kill them.  The House of Life thinks they're godlings and wants them dead as well and their new guardian their Uncle Amos disappears.  Are they the unwitting hosts of gods?  And will they manage to stay alive long enough to discover what really happened to their Dad and while they're at it save the world before Set turns the earth into a barren wasteland?<br /><br />I gave this book less than a perfect rating for one reason and one reason alone.  It wasn't the way it was written because in fact Riordan has presented a thrilling page turner from beginning to end in The Red Pyramid.  My issue with this book is that too many readers in the target audience will miss out on a great story because they're daunted by the massive length of the novel.  All three of my children are middle grade readers and I've been trying to convince them to read this since right after  I read this book the first time, which was within the first week it was released.  Even my oldest who actually really enjoys reading won't touch this book because she looks at the size of it then looks at me like I'm insane.  Her student dictionary is not as thick as The Red Pyramid and she doesn't enjoy reading that.  Kennedy, my daughter, is quick to devour books that are around half the length of this one which for an eleven year old fairly respectable, but she looks at this book and sees its size and concludes that it must be boring because only text books and dictionary compare in length.  Obviously many adult novels also compare but I'm quite certain my children believe that adults enjoy reading the dictionary and don't mind boring books.  She considers that a part of growing up, becoming boring.  And of course she's not ready to be boring yet, so no matter what I say she won't even attempt to read this book.  It's disappointing because all three of my children are missing out on a truly epic story.  So I can't in good faith give this novel a perfect rating because it doesn't matter how great the story is if the target audience is afraid to read it, then the journey isn't traveled and it's kind of like that tree falls in the forest idea.  Does it make a sound?  Well in some ways I say no because how is there sound if no one can hear it?  If a second edition of the novel were released in two or even better three parts making them an appealing length to average middle grade readers I would say the book deserved a perfect rating because then the target audience would be enticed to read it.  Riordan may write middle grade fiction at the moment, but I'd venture to guess that probably more than half of his readership, even of his middle grade fiction, is adult readers.  Adults aren't daunted by a long novel if it promises a good story, most children are.  So what I'm saying is I think the publisher should consider releasing a serialized version of the first novel in the Kane Chronicles so that the target audience won't be afraid to take the journey.<br /><br />The plot of this novel is a page turner from beginning to end and features an interesting point of view.  It's a first person novel, but it alternates between Carter and Sadie's points of view and separates them by chapter, labeling each chapter with the narrator so as you're clear on who is telling you the story. What's even more interesting is that the story is sandwiched between author letters than kind of set the personality of the story. In his letters, which are just as much fiction as the story itself Riordan claims to have received an audio recording of the story within and does not know whether the story enclosed is fiction or fact.  It seems to unreal to be fact, but the amount of factual detail included means that either the narrators are incredible well researched or their outrageous tale is true.  I was hooked on this story at the beginning of the letter from the author.  It reminded me a lot of how Elizabeth Kostova's Historian opened, sending chills down the spine as you look over your shoulder for the mysterious danger that comes of reading the tale.  After setting a wonderful feel for the novel you begin reading the double first person narrative which is filled with rich and vivid description and a roller coaster fast pace that leaves you devouring the pages from beginning to end.  In addition to offering an excellent story, the book is filled with educational information about Egyptian mythology and history.  The main plot is an adventure tale steeped in mythology and filled with magic, but the book also features a couple of subplots in which Carter and Sadie learn to be what they haven't been since Sadie was six, a real family.  They learn how to deal with the changes in their lives, the pain of the past and each other.  The book also features a semi love story for both the hero and heroine though neither of these are dramatically played up it's enough to snag interest and make you wonder if there's more to come for the siblings.  This is one of those stories that I'd deem a must read, don't miss it tale.<br /><br />Riordan as always has created impressive and intriguing characters.  He begins with the hero and heroine, siblings Carter and Sadie who come from a mixed race family where each of them favors the opposite parent so they don't actually look related.  So in that alone the characters are intriguing because they deal with multiple prejudices which only a person of mixed race could really understand in the way they can.  And we can see how this affects who they've become as we get to know them.  Carter's Dad has drilled into him that he has to always be impeccable if he wants to be treated with any respect, he doesn't dress like an average teen because when he isn't well dressed people look at him as if he's a criminal because he's of African American descent.  Every time anyone asks Sadie about her family she somehow becomes an outsider or outcast, she's always different, never normal, so she gave up trying to fit in and streaks her hair with crayola colors, wearing combat boots with even her school uniform.  Carter has always felt like since he's the child with his father, a man who's lost not only his wife, but his daughter, he has to do his best to make his dad happy.  He follows orders, listens to directions and you see how he bites his tongue and does his best to be accommodating because of the hand life has dealt him.  Sadie feel resentful of being left to be raised by her grandparents instead of staying with her father so she's outspoken and rebellious.  Each of them is envious of the other's life but neither of them understands what that life was really like, nor do they at the beginning understand each other.  Even without the whole magic and Egyptian god twist these would be interesting characters.  But when you add that to the mix the characters become more, the kind of characters that stick with you and seem larger than life.  Carter and Sadie display excellent emotional depth and are very easy to relate to feel for and root for.  What's more both leading character show an extreme amount of character growth throughout the course of the novel.  It's not an instantaneous thing.  You can see with each scene and each experience how it is both shaping them and changing them. Additionally the secondary character presented in this novel are at the very least distinctive and for the most part well developed.  No character introduced here lays flat on the page, they each come alive in a way that goes beyond your average book and shows Riordan's rare talent for character creation.<br /><br />Overall I would definitely recommend this book to pretty much everyone.  Again the only thing I can think to note in a negative manner is that the length is daunting to many middle grade readers, but those willing to take on a book so lengthy will be rewarded with a journey unlike any other.  Highly recommended.alone the characters are intriguing because they deal with multiple prejudices which only a person of mixed race could really understand in the way they can.  And we can see how this affects who they've become as we get to know them.  Carter's Dad has drilled into him that he has to always be impeccable if he wants to be treated with any respect, he doesn't dress like an average teen because when he isn't well dressed people look at him as if he's a criminal because he's of African American descent.  Every time anyone asks Sadie about her family she somehow becomes an outsider or outcast, she's always different, never normal, so she gave up trying to fit in and streaks her hair with crayola colors, wearing combat boots with even her school uniform.  Carter has always felt like since he's the child with his father, a man who's lost not only his wife, but his daughter, he has to do his best to make his dad happy.  He follows orders, listens to directions and you see how he bites his tongue and does his best to be accommodating because of the hand life has dealt him.  Sadie feel resentful of being left to be raised by her grandparents instead of staying with her father so she's outspoken and rebellious.  Each of them is envious of the other's life but neither of them understands what that life was really like, nor do they at the beginning understand each other.  Even without the whole magic and Egyptian god twist these would be interesting characters.  But when you add that to the mix the characters become more, the kind of characters that stick with you and seem larger than life.  Carter and Sadie display excellent emotional depth and are very easy to relate to feel for and root for.  What's more both leading character show an extreme amount of character growth throughout the course of the novel.  It's not an instantaneous thing.  You can see with each scene and each experience how it is both shaping them and changing them. Additionally the secondary character presented in this novel are at the very least distinctive and for the most part well developed.  No character introduced here lays flat on the page, they each come alive in a way that goes beyond your average book and shows Riordan's rare talent for character creation.<br /><br />Overall I would definitely recommend this book to pretty much everyone.

B004HO6HWA|5.0|Jason Stathom never fails to please me with his action movies! Another one, The mechanic is full of action and intense graphics! A great movie!<br />I could watch it again and again. Recommend for those who like action and shooting movies.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. It surprised the heck out of me and left me going \\"Oh My Gosh, I can't believe that happened.\\" I would recommend to anyone.
B000002NHN|5.0|I love her voice and the melodies. There is a harmony in her music. One needs a calm, open, and receptive mind to be able to understand and experience her music fully. If you're reading this now I would highly recommend this album to begin with. This is one of my favorite albums. I also have 3 of her other albums as well. Near future I like to have all her albums...yes its that good! If you have a taste of this kind of music then you will not like it but LOVE it!!
0345803485|1.0|I just finished reading this book & feel like I was robbed.  I was hoping to get much more out of it since everyone has been raving about how great it is. Really?  Who has been reading this book?  Teenagers?  The characters are unrealistic, immature and just plain silly.  The sex gets old after a while because it's SO repetitive. The female character has an orgasm on almost every other page.  The male character is a sex charged 27 year old control freak billionaire with an insatiable appetite for kinky sex.  It's like a horny teenage fantasy. Not worth the time spent reading or money spent purchasing it.

0525478817|5.0|Up until reading this book I never understood the hype behind John Green. The only other book of his that I had read was Paper Towns, which wasn't bad I just didn't jump up and down about it like other people. I just wrote it off as an over-hyped book that just didn't do as much for me. I honestly wasn't even going to run out and pick up this book right away, although ALL my blogger friends were pre-ordering it and all pre-orders were signed which lead me to purchase the book soon after its release date. I decided because everyone was reading it, that i'd read it right away, and this book honestly made me understand the hype behind John Green. It took me a few months to wrap my mind around writing this review simply because I knew I wouldn't be able to formulate words that would do this book any sort of justice.<br /><br />The relationship between Gus and Hazel was phenomenally crafted. They were witty and snarky and had a great outlook on life although both of them were terminally ill. This book can't even recieve enough justice from a review. So i'm going to keep this short and just tell you that you need to go out and pick up this book if you haven't yet. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll be able to relate if you've ever lost anyone important in your life that was taken away way too soon.<br /><br />Hats off to you John Green!

030746363X|4.0|There are a lot of interesting concepts in the book, but the most important one is that personal experimentation with before and after measurement will tell you what works for you. Some of the negative reviews are making blanket complaints either about particular statements (starch metabolism, protein effects, etc.) or blanket condemnations that some of it just couldn't possibly work (nothing is this fast, particular routines didn't work for the reviewer, etc.)<br /><br />This misses the point, people. Ferriss is recounting his experiences, and suggesting that they may work for you as well, but his main suggestion is for you to try and evaluate things for yourself. I don't see any way to prove that Ferriss is lying about his personal results, fantastic though they seem to be, but absent a third party lab test I also have no reason to say he's not telling the truth. Bodies are notoriously variable in their response to exercise and diet, so even if every one of Ferriss's experiments is true as expressed, the sample size of one doesn't offer a lot of confidence that they will have the same effect on you. However, for the experimentally inclined, this book provides a lot of starting points for trying to shortcut the traditional body building grind en route to various strength and appearance targets.<br /><br />This is a fairly quick read, and I personally found the ideas interesting enough to try a few out (with results at least as good as any other effective exercise book). Hyperbolic subtitle notwithstanding, I'm glad I read it and that Ferriss seems to be willing to do and recount extreme experiments on himself for the rest of us to consider without going first.
B004V2AWKG|5.0|This is a book that I cannot wait for my children to get old enough to read.  My husband, father and I all read it at the same time because a friend of ours who is a school teacher asked for our opinion.  We were all in unanimous agreement that this is a fantastic book that everyone should read.  Lois Lowery does a great job weaving a story about a different kind of society in which everything seems okay - at least until about a third of the way through the book. Once she's reeled you in she lowers the subtle boom and shocks you with the way in which this \\"okay society\\" isn't so okay and leaves you wondering if it ever will be.<br />Respectfully - CB Anderson
B00753MBHA|3.0|Generally agree with other 3 star reviews.  This CD has one outstanding track, \\"Shadow Soldiers\\".  The other tracks are not bad but do not nearly have the hooks of \\"Blood for Nations\\" (which I rated am enthusiastic 5 stars).  When I listend though this for the third time I thought that this album was largely the \\"B sides\\" left over from the \\"Blood of Nations\\" production.  A significant disappointment to me after the outstanding previous work.

044024630X|4.0|...we are often reminded throughout this novel. Things were different back in the day, prior to 9/11.  This is the prequel to the first in the Jack Reacher series of novels that started with The Killing Floor, in 1997.  The Affair takes us back 6 months prior to that, so we readers that have been following the series, are finally privy to the circumstances that drove Reacher from the Army back then, where he was a Major in the military police, with an exemplary career and the medals to show for it. In the following novels, his strong, kiss-ass character prevails, as an ex-military MP with a strong need for righting wrongs, wherever his travels may lead him. He travels light, just a portable tooth brush in his pocket, but he's always ready for whatever crosses his path. This series is one both my husband and I enjoy, recommended for either gender.<br /><br />After the last couple of slower-paced installments in the series, this was a great jump-start. Author Child shows us he's still got it. Lots of action and plot twists, with just enough steamy sex to keep things interesting.  For those that want to know, there is hardly any vulgar language, just enough to get a point across a time or two. It moves along swiftly. He reels us in from chapter one, keeps the reader engaged throughout the journey, and the ending us just as good as the beginning.<br /><br />I easily picture Jim Caviezel as Reacher, (of \\"Point of Interest\\") as he is physically described much like this, even down to the previously long hair, such as Reacher has in this novel.  Maybe Tom Cruise will somehow be made to look larger for the movie-in-progress than he actually is.<br /><br />Don't miss this one. Followers of the series \\"need to know\\" and new readers will be hooked into the series.
B006YC74E8|5.0|Great app, honestly! It fulfilled it's purpose, and I think it is fabulous.<br />I, however, only gave it 4 stars because it is a tad bit boring, with only a few options.
B007IQX1G4|1.0|Did not like this film at all.  Unable to finish the movie.  Wish I could get a refund.  Very disappointed. Ugh.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Not so bad.  Gets better with upgrades.  Doesn't seem to be so real money driven like other Glue games.  I'm tired writing this review but I need more words.
B00723NWJE|4.0|I think I will like and enjoy this new CD.  It did not \\"grab\\" me the first time through but each time I listen to it I enjoy it more.  That was my experience too when I picked up her previous album.<br /><br />I really do not like the oversized packaging.  I don't mind a cardboard case but this one does not fit on my shelf of CDs.  I plan to trim the artwork down to the traditional size and insert it within a normal CD case.
B002ZG99G8|4.0|THE LOSERS is one whale of a fun flick.  When a group of CIA black ops specialists get betrayed and then are presumed dead by the American government, it's time to kick some serious bad guy arse.  And the villain is Max (Jason Patric is a hoot), a maniac who will stop at nothing to sell a new doomsday weapon to the highest bidder.  The specialists pair up with a mercenary named Aisha (Zoe Saldana is worth a couple of wolf howls), whose motives for stopping Max aren't quite clear, and the group hatches its plot and goes into nonstop action.  Of course the action is over the top and approaches cartoon proportions, but again, it's so much fun.  When shoot-'em-ups really let the lead fly it's cinematic bliss for this immature hombre.<br /><br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Chris Evans (who is another memorable character), Idris Elba, Columbus Short, and Oscar Jaenada play the wronged CIA specialists attempting to restore their reputations and even the score; this group has terrific chemistry and the locker room interactions are worth chuckles galore.  Yes, THE LOSERS is predictable and occasionally lame, but it's well done and the plot moves and the action is pedal-to-the-metal furious.  And the ending is entirely open, meaning a Losers II might be coming to a theater near you.  I'm game.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I was disappointed by the first Mission Impossible, however, as the sereies goes on the films seem to get better and better, I LOVE this one, full of action, suspense, death defying stunts I would NEVER try even if you paid me and an all out shoot'em up of a good time, I especially love how they included Paula Patton (Deja Vu) in the cast and other actors you seldom see or hear about, along with Tom cruise of course, who does a great job of pulling off his own stunts and keeps from dying on set somehow.<br />All in all a great film ALOT of fun, not disappointing in the least and always expect the unexpcted from Mission Impossible films, this message will self destruct...
B004T4LUPW|5.0|After reading mixed reviews I thought I'd give this a try. My whole family uses Google Calendar to coordinate our busy schedule and although Cozi Family Calendar looked nice (color codes for individuals and all), unless you pay $5 a month, you will have to prepare yourself to put up with popping ads not to mention it does not sync with Google Calendar.  And I wasn't ready to re-enter all our recurring and other items into any new calendar.  Once I downloaded Calengoo, synchronizing both Calengoo on Kindle Fire and Goodle Calendar was intuitive and a breeze!!!  If you are a  Google Calendar user and have Kindle Fire, I don't see any other reason not to use Calengoo.  I'm a busy Mom always on-the-go, and this was an answer to my frustration!  You won't be disappointed.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Moneyball by Michael Lewis is a great read and enhanced both my enjoyment and appreciation of baseball. I was interested in reading the book after seeing the movie. The movie by the same name, staring Brad Pitt, is a good movie that was nominated for an Academy Award. This book, like all books, is many times better than the movie.  Moneyball is well written, insightful and often inspiring. Having read Moneyball, I am now interested in reading other Michael Lewis books.

B000003TA4|5.0|In 1991, a great album was released, entitled Nevermind. Let's do a track by track dissection of this masterpiece.<br />01. Smells Like Teen Spirit- decent, played to death and back<br />02. In Bloom- surprisingly heavy for a somewhat poppy record<br />03. Come as You Are- soft, but good<br />04. Breed- not so sure<br />05. Lithium- popular, one of my favorites<br />06. Polly- easily the best song on the disc<br />07. Territorial Pi**ings- very good, likeable for fans of \\"Bleach\\" [[ASIN:B000YN351Y Bleach]] link<br />08. Drain You- Rock Band 2. Good song...<br />09. Lounge Act- Krist's bass is very audible here.<br />10. Stay Away- hmmm...<br />11. On A Plain- just fine<br />12. Something in the Way- very relaxing<br />13. Endless Nameless (hidden)- Weird..<br />All in all, I would give this album a 10 if I could.<br />Peace.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I  just really love this cd.. it's been one of my favorites to listen to in the past few months. The lyrics are to be taken with a grain of salt, and I think they're kinda funny. Just catchy, sultry, and nice all around :)
B000BM6AVA|1.0|I just completely despise this album by System Of A Down. System is good, but this album sucks. I do not like this album, it System's worst ever. I can't belive it was released.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a book that will live on for generations. Absolutly incredable. Words can't describe how amazing it is!! Praise The Hunger Games
B00005NNMJ|4.0|I would never go so far as to say that this was Accepts crowning achievment I liked Restless and Wild, Metal Heart, and Russian Roulette much better. But I will go on to say that once you get pass the album cover which I still hate and some of the lyrical content you will find some of the best metal of the day. Accept was indeed a force to be dealt with I and love the way that they sound. Of course Im a huge Saxon fan and the two are similar in alot of ways. Especially with the twin guitar attack.<br />  It drives my friends nuts but Id pick any of the above Accept albums over anything Metallica anyday, simply due to content but especially attitude. Their heads are so big they drove each other nuts.<br />  Anyway now we have Blood of The Nations and Stalingrad to deal with. Talk about achievement !
B00006G8K0|5.0|Some of the really old, and classic movies are hard to find. Amazon.com and the many companies that they work with to help old movie buffs, such as me, find some of these classics is great. I'm really looking forward to finding some more old classics!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very hot book. It was so off the charts, but I had to finish reading. At every turn there was a reason to finish. At times it was romantic but most of the time this book was just plain hot and sexy. I had no idea what I was getting mysel into when I read the reviews. You will not be disappointed!
B003MC5N28|4.0|I wonder why utopias are so frightening.<br /><br />Jonas has a childhood many people would wish for. He has structure, order, purpose, affection. He is never hungry or frightened. He knows his place in the world, and he is content with it. Then, as he turns 12, he is selected for a special job, one that destroys his world by making him look deeper into it, to understand why it happens the way it does, what the moral cost of his comfort is.<br /><br />I should have read this book years ago. My mom finally gave up and bought it for my Kindle because we were talking about THE TERRORISTS OF IRUSTAN, and bounded societies.<br /><br />The Sameness reminded me of the dys/utopia in Madeline L'Engle's A WRINKLE IN TIME, where all the children bounce balls at the same time, and all the mothers call the children in at the same time. There is obviously this thread of fear and horror in both books about being required to be regimented, or pay a terrible price. I wonder if it's a coincidence that THE GIVER and WRINKLE IN TIME were written by women  at a time when women were fighting to get out of the regimented and nicey-nicey world. To go on one's own, beyond the boundaries of civilization and rules, is fearful and dangerous and you don't know how it's going to end, but sometimes you have to head for the woods, or the giant throbbing brain, whichever is relevant. Interestingly, Lowry's character, Jonas, is male, and I would perhaps have found the story less interesting if he were female, because the choice he made might be considered traditionally feminine. The gender roles were actually pretty interesting through the whole book.<br /><br />I thought the characters were sketched in lightly, but the plot and problem were compelling, and it almost makes sense that personality was not something Jonas thought a lot about. Lowry did a great job of capturing the incuriousity some children have about adult things.<br /><br />Read if: You want to think about what you are used to and the value or lack thereof in compliance and equality.<br /><br />Skip if: You are horrified by utopias, your issues are not about fear of being the same.e value or lack thereof in compliance and equality.<br /><br />Skip if: You are horrified by utopias, your issues are not about fear of being the same.
B00005S6K8|5.0|I remember watching the original Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn and loving it, so when this newer version was on the TV, I watched it and loved it as well. Unlike some, who either liked the older or the newer version of it, I'd have to say that I liked both equally. Yes, they each have their own negative/positive moments (ie: the comment where Hepburn's \\"grown up\\" Sabrina was more childish acting, whereas Ormond's was more adult-like and sophisticated) I do have to agree with. HOWEVER, it is the storyline itself that captured my interest from the start, and I belive that both actresses played the role convincingly.<br /><br />Possible SPOILER alert:<br />In my own opinion, Sabrina doesn't entirely \\"grow up\\" after she leaves for Paris, since one of the reasons for her going is to get away from David, the womanizing younger brother of the millionaire family her father chauffeurs. As a child/teenager, she is (pretty much) obsessed with him, while he doesn't even see her as anything but the chauffeur's daughter. But when she is in Paris, she cant seem to forget him, while he is now finally planning to settle down and marry. When she returns home, she is a very beautiful woman, with the touch of Paris elegance, and yet she is clearly not over David. He has now noticed her as a woman and is paying her the attention she's always wanted him to.<br /><br />David's older brother, Linus, always looking out for the family business and money, is none too pleased with the attention David is now showing Sabrina, because David's fiancee is the daughter of their biggest business client, and one mis-step could put a halt to the contract. Therefore, Linus decides to step in and distract Sabrina from David before things go too far and ruin the merger. Long story short, they both unintentionally fall in love with each other. I think after spending time with Linus, and actually BEING in love rather than infatuated, NOW she is grown up. Which things matter more than just a silly girlhood crush. Only, Linus has always had the business-side at the forefront, and knows he may have to break her heart. Ah, the decisions he must face! What's more important, Money or love? Which does he choose?<br /><br />I love this movie and I just *had* to buy it...
0345410025|5.0|I am only half way through this book and wish it found its way into my hands 20 or 30 years ago when I was going through school!  The bottom line is this is a short, simple, AMAZINGLY EFFECTIVE way to memorize just about anything.  I was \\"horrible\\" with names - and now I can memorize any name, maybe not in an instant, but in less than a minute.  My wife and I did some experiments to test me for fun and after her reciting a random list of 10 things just once, without me writing them down, I was able to memorize them all in order (and still remember them weeks later). I was also able to memorize and repeat a 10 digit random number last night in under 3 minutes.  Practical applications are abundant (social security numbers, phone numbers, names, to do list, etc.).  Application is surprisingly easy to do if you can form a mental picture.  MUST READ FOR ALL AGES!
B0080KHWJY|5.0|While similar in many respects to Pillars of the Earth, including most of the same flaws (though usually to a lesser degree), World Without End is a much more mature work.  It is simultaneously more Romantic and less romanticized, in the best and worst sense of the terms, respectively.  The plot is somewhat tighter, the characterization is a bit deeper, and it's all integrated around a central theme: independence, in all the major aspects of life---intellectual, economic, and romantic.<br /><br />The story centers around the love of a man who wants to build the tallest structure in fourteenth-century England and a woman devoted to medicine.  The latter storyline is especially compelling, as she tries to cope with outbreaks of the plague as well as she can, without simply acceding to the authority of the Ancients (such as Hippocrates).  She follows her own mind, even when that brings her into conflict with the Church and gives rise to accusations of heresy and witchcraft.  Follett does a much better job here than he did in Pillars of the Earth showing, in keeping with his theme, that religious authoritarianism is fundamentally opposed to the independent mind.<br /><br />(Unfortunately, Follett undercuts his theme of independence somewhat with the explicit suggestion toward the end that moral character is inherited from one's ancestry just like, say, the color of one's hair.  But that idea is somewhat, though not entirely, mitigated by the actual events of the story, and in any case is a minor flaw in what is by and large an excellent piece of work.)<br /><br />There is a lot else going on in this epic story as well, and the whole thing is a very good read.

Computer can't recognize the device; worked fine one morning and then stopped that afternoon.  Tried new cable, tried different PC, etc.  It is just a piece of junk. There is a reason it has as many 1 star ratings as 5 star-- if I could give zero stars then I would.

A classic tribute to TAAB and just about everything else Tull has ever done - even A!  Ian Anderson is an accomplished genius. Please, please bring the tour to Oregon.
0060899220|5.0|I've never worked in any food service industry, and this book makes me want to, yet NOT want to be a part of it. Bourdain's ability to write makes you feel like he is communicating directly to you. You can hear his voice and mannerisms as you read. I absolutely LOVE this book and look forward to reading all the others he has written!
B007R41E8O|4.0|Fun game. I've found myself too easily relying on the hint button though. And sometimes hitting it without trying to.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is a great app that I use every day. you put it in and find it from anywhere. try it out.
B005OZE9SA|3.0|I am being generous by giving this 3 stars, and I only do so because it is low latency, sound quality is good, and the drivers work great on w7 64 bit. But this device has a huge flaw. It clips like crazy when using a guitar on the instrument setting.  Active and passive pickups both clip even with the input volume all the way down. I suppose the problem could be fixed by using a DI between the guitar and interface but that just requires more money. You can switch to line and use the guitar without clipping but that affects the tone in my opinion.<br /><br />If you need an interface to use your guitar with, look elsewhere. otherwise this is a good unit at a  very affordable price.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I just love this game. I can pick it up and put it down whenever I please. The graphics are very nice.  I play it on iPad and Kindle Fire. Thanks for a fun game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|as soon as I got this I could not put it down. it became very addicting. I highly recommend it<br />very addicting
B005AKFXZW|5.0|I wasn't so keen on reading this book but a friend raved about it and when I started reading I was drawn in.<br />It is so clever and unusual.  Well written.
B0063IH60K|5.0|You can get annoyed by the ads every now and then, but that's ok for the free version, isn't it?
B004TI5N38|5.0|Really good read- Couldn't put it down. Fast paced with a suprise ending. However if you are a Baldacci fan you know they are usually suprise endings.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The \\"Wool\\" Omnibus (books one through five) makes a fascinating read.  Hugh Howey creates people, not just cardboard characters, and they face problems, not just plot elements.  Howey creates lots of suspense in his books, but it feels genuine, never contrived.  The people, their problems, and the suspense of what they might choose to do, kept me reading for hours and hours, caught up in his thoroughly believable and well imagined universe. I recommend this book, and this author, highly.<br /><br />After six decades of reading fiction, I seldom discover anything new, or even find anything worth reading anymore; maybe after a point, a person may just have read too much.  But this set of five books is a great find! (I have found only one other book in the past year which I truly enjoyed: \\"Ready Player One\\" by Ernest Cline.)<br /><br />I loved the five books of \\"Wool.\\"  Hugh Howey is an artist at work, and I look forward to more of his writing.
0307887960|1.0|This diet sounds good in theory, but it's AWFUL to follow!!! TOO MUCH MEAT!!!! Talk about feeling like CRAP!!!<br /><br />I felt so sick after the first day of the attack phase that I didn't continue the diet.  It was just too much meat.  It's been several day's since and I still can't stand the thought of eating most meats.  I felt so terrible, I really don't see how this can be healthy. Duh! I should've realized before I started this diet, but of course I was looking for a quick fix.<br /><br />I've come to the conclusion there is no quick fix.  The best way to loose weight is to make healthy eating choices and exercise more.  I know that, but it's just so tempting to try these quick weight loss diets.  Shame on me....
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I LOVED this book from page one! I stopped reading it after the first couple of chapters only long enough to phone my son in order to tell him that he must get this book immediately or sooner!  Then I went back to reading nonstop.  My son got it, started reading the book, then realized he had the original Dungeon Module, Tomb of Horrors, by Gary Gygax, in his possession.  He read the rest of the book side by side with the module.  Then he mailed the module to me.  I read it, then reread Ready Player One.  What fun!  My son and I have shared a love of gaming for many years now. (Can it really be a quarter of a century? Zounds!) We are definitely \\"target audience\\" for this book.  I loved the creative storyline.  I admit I giggled, laughed, snorted, yelped, and grinned many times, reading the book. Just a blast!  Loved it, loved it, loved it!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it's a really addicting game, so far i havent had any glitches, but it definitely gets hard. haha. but a very fun game

B0067R0APK|4.0|this app is great! but on my kindle fire, the icon *only* shows up in the carousel. on the various shelves (favorites, apps, etc.) all you see is a grey square. i tried un- and then re-installing it, but the problem persists. fix this, and i'll give the app five stars!
0802473164|5.0|While most of the techniques for improving marital and romantic relationship are things that have been utilized for years, the concept is effective.  The concept of love languages makes it very easy to understand for everyone.  I like that this book does not make attempts to make certain aspects gender specific much like the famed \\"Men are From Mars, Women are from Venus.\\"  This book gives concepts that transend gender and focus on how the other person can fill their partner's needs or \\"love tank\\" and do so while understanding the oh so important \\"why\\".  I think this is a very important piece to this book.  Not only giving the reader some ideas on how to foster a good solid relationship but also helping them to understand why these actions are important.  This is where this book shines for me as opposed to others that just tell you what to do and very little on telling the reader why they should do it.<br /><br />This is a book I will be recommending heavily.
B00812W9QM|5.0|caveat: although only a minute or so of any action in the episode is described below, some may nevertheless wish to know absolutely nothing before viewing the episode so may consider some of the below a spoiler.<br /><br />creator matthew weiner never just drops something into the script of this show without its having far reaching repurcussions. here we find out that don's wife has left the agency for loftier acting heights but has left the new, poor jewish copywriter in the hole for lunch money.  fifteen dollars is a lot of lunches in the mid sixties. that she just used him like this from her position of wealth and privilege does not speak well about her character.  this scene takes all of five seconds but i can't help feeling it is very important.  there are far longer scenes with meagan in this episode but it is the lunch money one which bothers me,<br /><br />peggy has a fair amount of professional quandries in this episode.  she has fairly meaty scenes in each episode so i think she is of increasing importance in this show. no matter who else is dropped from this show, i expect peggy will stay and grow.<br /><br />pete campbell just keeps wading into the deep water of trouble.  i also feel his gift of skis from roger sterling has not just been idly dropped into this episode.  that too is a scene of about twenty seconds but i can't help feel more might flow from it than peter's romantic yearnings which are explored far more deeply. peter's sense of entitlement just grows and grows, much like roger sterling's did.  it fits since they are the two partners who did not come up from nothing. neither is ever satisifed with anything since they feel they are due everything, which makes them perfect enemies.<br /><br />betty has not reappeared again but i expect that she, sally and her mother-in-law have something good in store for us before the season closes. i am expecting major fireworks with this trio.<br /><br />jon hamm does a truly extraordinary job as don draper.  i have seen him in other things, SNL, 30 Rock and Bridesmaids.

0800177363|4.0|The acting in this movie was fantastic on all counts. The ultimate message of the movie... hopeless unfortunately. Despite the best of intentions, man's efforts fail - except the doctor gets a girlfriend. Folks, don't let the ending fool you. There is room for the reality of the miraculous. Treating people everyday, I can't imagine myself relating to them without acknowledging them as spiritual beings and not merely patients. The movie - the story - was empty of any reference to God or spirituality - just pure (human founded) science. Another instance of Hollywood leaving God out of the picture. Yet, with God all things are possible, and that is the basis of hope and healing. So, 4 stars for a well acted movie; minus 1 for a movie that would leave people with an non theistic message lacking in hope.
0439023521|5.0|This is an incredible story of an alternate civilization following something cataclysmic to our present world. Each year, a government organized event, somewhat similar in theme to the gladiator spectacles of old, called the Hunger Games are conducted, complete with a full onslaught of 24/7 media coverage. Participants falling in a specific age group are selected at random, two from each of the districts that comprise the new country. It's a fight to the death and the last one standing is the victor.<br /><br />I was struck by the extraordinary rawness of this story but at the same time, the complexity of the tale. Katniss Everdeen, the 16-year old heroine, is wise beyond her age and chronicles the games from her perspective. The concepts of this new society are provocative and disturbing but somehow, you find yourself considering the possibility as it taps into the baser aspects of the human condition. I found this book fascinating and am bound to finish the trilogy.<br /><br />This isn't your typical young adult story so if you're not a fan of books directed to this age group, don't let that be a barrier to reading this story, as it was for me. I just wish I'd read it earlier.
B007M6P01O|5.0|This season definitely was much more captivating. I especially liked how some of the characters have developed. Usually when I watch a show with more than 1 season, the future seasons never meet my expectations but this show... is something else. This show isn't just action packed with zombie slashing and head shooting; it is also packed with a story and character development which in my opinion, sets it apart from all the other zombie themed shows/movies. I can't wait to see where they take this! I'm especially curious about how they left Season 2 off with the finale. I will definitely be getting the third season!

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I watched a couple of video reviews of this amplifier on youtube before buying. It is very impressive for what it does. It even has a bass boost, which works quite well. I used this for riding a motorcycle, along with a cheap mp3 player. The sound was plenty loud enough to hear while riding at interstate speeds (70mph+). I like that the battery is rechargeable. I took it on an 8 hour ride and it performed the whole trip.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|I've come to expect good things from Aardman Animations, and this lives up to my high expectations. The story itself is kid-friendly and amusing, but with plenty for the grownups to enjoy. The generally gentle tone avoids aggression and darker themes, so will probably work well for all but the most skittish of kids. Best of all, production values are of the best quality. The stop-animation figure have just the right goofiness, beautifully animated. The sets are spectacular, too - each one is actually constructed and decorated as you see it on screen, and there are dozens. And, in a few places, it seems that modern technology enhances this most classic of animation styles. Clouds, flame, and water effects work well, adding a touch of realism to the whimsical figures and props. Like the Wallace and Gromit tradition before it, Pirates is a hoot!<br /><br />-- wiredweird
1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani's description of her NDE  is  clear, intelligent, comprehensive and full of human interest - the best I've read.She describes  states of consciousness experienced in an advanced stage of meditative practice and along the spiritual path which tally with an esoteric understanding of the soul. She experiences the soul state, its freedom, love and wisdom. This was what I was looking for in a book about the NDE, i.e. an actual experience which verified the teachings I promote. She has now a knowing which has transformed her life and brought together, medicine, psychology and spirituality in a fresh and profound way.

0345803485|5.0|This book is shocking, exciting, erotic, and well written. That is a very hard combination to achieve, especially for what is essentially a romance novel. I made my husband read it as well, and even he found it was impossible to put down. Have fun ;)
B000NTPDSW|1.0|Complete rip-off. Sound quality is enhanced while video is grainy much of the time especially in dark places. And lots of video noise especially when you look at the sky. I wanted to replace my Laser disk set....not worth the expense. I went back to look at my Laser Disks and the viewing experience was much more pleasant on the Laser Disk. At times the Blu-ray will be clearer but not often...and they did something with skin tones making them look less natural sometimes blotchy. I am shocked by this restoration....and will not be so eager to replace perfectly fine Laser Disks or older DVDs transferred to Blu-ray.<br /><br />If directors cannot improve the picture and sound quality they should not release on Blu-ray. They only reason is greed,

0345803485|1.0|Any writer who has studied the craft (or even Googled \\"how to write a book\\" for ten minutes) knows this: Start with action and hook the reader.<br /><br />The opening scene shows this woman brushing her hair. Yes. Brushing her hair.  It's too bad we didn't get to read more along these lines.  Maybe she could show us how (the ridiculously named) Anastasia Steele flosses her teeth, or picks lint off her jacket.  Maybe in the sequels we get to find out how she washes her hands or puts on her makeup.  I'm not saying the book should have opened with a Michael Bay series of explosions, but come on.  Give us something a little less pedestrian.  Since the book is so provocative, maybe she should wake up from an erotic dream.<br /><br />Everything that follows reads like filler, like she's trying to fill the space before we get to the sexy part.  I lost interest.  Maybe I'm not the right audience for this.  Do you have to be a desperate housewife to find this appealing?<br /><br />One other tip: adverbs (those stupid words ending in LY) are the hallmark of a poor writer with no imagination.  Once you realize this, you see them everywhere and you cringe.  \\"She smiles kindly.\\"  Gripping.  How about \\"She smiles out of habit, like the cameras are watching her every move.\\"<br /><br />It reminds me a lot of \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", another over-hyped, mediocre book, full of one dimensional boring characters in their 20s.<br /><br />And like the author of that book, this one is going to have to cash in quick, before the rest of the world catches on to how boring she is.

B0067R0APK|3.0|it has some limitations.  First, there isn't an intensity gauge so you don't know how intense the rain is.  Second, the app only works in portrait view, not in landscape.

B003V1WTMM|4.0|The mystery surrounding Milderhurst Castle and one girl's determination to find the truth kept  my interest in reading to satisfy my own curiosity as to what happened years ago.I found the different personalities in the three sisters to be especially interesting and was relieved to finally find out what really happened to Tom.I was happy to see that Edie and her mother Meredith became closer in their mother /daughter relationship as a result of Edie's digging into the past.The final destruction of the castle and the sisters was a sad ending to this whole saga but the renewal of relationships and the very structure of the castle itself leaves the reader happier in this new beginning.
0345803485|1.0|Certainly one of the most tedious and boring books I have ever attempted to read. Like many have said, it was not very readable and the character development was lacking. Not worth the paper it was printed on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have never got addicted to a book or series like this. I am not even an avid reader, but I got hooked with this author.
0307956350|3.0|In the spirit of the atypical James Bond novel, [[ASIN:0141045051 The Spy Who Loved Me]], this debut effort is as much about the dynamics of romantic relationships as it is about secret agents. Chris Pavone's The Expats also offers realistic descriptions of European domestic life--the author lived in Luxembourg. Better than another recent spy thriller, [[ASIN:0670023213 The Spy Who Jumped Off the Screen]], The Expats finds similar inspiration from the genre's leading men, in particular, [[ASIN:B000W07EKW Jason Bourne]]. There's a covert meeting in Berlin (\\"Same time tomorrow, north end of Kollwitzplatz, Prenzlauerberg.\\") plus another scene on the Pont Neuf, just like in The Bourne Identity. There's even an assassination gone wrong, complicated by an unexpected family member, just like in The Bourne Supremacy.<br /><br />Pavone offers some nice descriptive turns: \\"Snowflakes began to flutter, drifting softly to the street lined with eighteenth-century &lt;&lt;hotels particuliers>>, massive arched doors leading to courtyards, a matching suite of three imposing buildings leaning against one another, like fashion models posing for a homoerotic shot, skin-on-skin-on-skin.\\" (p.174) Sometimes, however, he can't help but go overboard on the similes: \\"A train traversed the gorge on the high aqueduct-style bridge. On the semi-frozen river below, a duck quacked insistently, sounding like a grumpy old man arguing with a cashier.\\" (p.296)<br /><br />My main gripe is that the action jumps around too much, both across time and scene settings. Furthermore, the final three chapters resort far too much on exposition. And a few period pop culture references will not age well: \\"Like Travolta, near-dancing in Pulp Fiction.\\" And yeah, maybe it's not believable that a wife could keep her fifteen-year CIA career a secret from her husband. Overall, however, this was an enjoyable read.<br /><br />3.5 stars<br /><br />[The reviewer was provided with a complimentary copy of the book.]
0312330537|5.0|Shantaram is a gripping tale that holds you glued to the next page.  Expertly written, it's author holds your hand and guides you along a journey of much pain,and intermittent joy.

B004VRK436|4.0|Zathura is a great book-to-film adaptation to come out in this past decade. The idea of a board game coming to life has always been a fun idea to bring to life. First done with Jumanji we now have Zathura. Zathura successfully ponders many tensions in our daily lives, such as sibling rivalry. The two brothers in this film are very dysfunctional and are both full of pure hatred for one another.  Don't worry, there is a fantastically satisfying ending. The divorce of the parents had destroyed the relationship between the two. The little brother is always living in his brother's shadow. Desperately trying to get his father to be proud of him. Zathura offers a engaging story with a great balance of everything. The special effects are extremely believable and the sets and props are outstanding. They definitely look alien for sure. The film offers some brilliant photography and dazzling lighting. Suspense is abundant in this film, so I don't recommend the movie for younger kids. Many life and death situations happen in this film, this can be scary at times. This was a first for a couple stars that today, are now some of the biggest names on the silver screen. Being one of Kristen Stewart and Josh Hutcherson's first movies. It never fails to deliver excitement. I'd give this movie a 4.5 out of 5. Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! youth critic, Blake H.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|I quickly downloaded this novel to my Kindle before jumping on a five hour flight.  By the time I got to my destination, I had read nearly three-fourths of it - even with all the interruptions.  Thank goodness for a three hour time difference, because that gave me three more hours to finish it before my eyes closed. Rarely do I have the opportunity to read a book in one sitting - and rare is the book that compels me to do it!<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the complicated plot and the characters.  It's difficult to love an assassin, but you'll be rooting for this one.  Amidst the many twists and turns, Baldacci stays on course - and it's tough to figure this one out until the very last pages. An assassin with a heart is a bit different, but, given the circumstances, you'll be glad he has one.<br /><br />This novel is Patterson-esque in that it has short chapters which deliver the facts and move on quickly.  No time for messing around or superfluous stuff.  That's refreshing when you're trying to get to the \\"meat\\".  Everything has a purpose even if it's just to lead you off in the wrong direction!<br /><br />This is a good read - and I can sure recommend it for long flights!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I am, as usual, very pleased with my order.  It was delivered in a timely manner and in in excellent condition. If you like the serious I would recommend adding this one to your collection.
B001PP9ALY|2.0|The reviews of this movie seem to be roughly divided in two categories: 1. I like the action of the movie and 2. I think it's stupid. For me, despite some funny ideas and decent action (I liked the train scene close to the end), the movie certainly fits into the second category. Because there is just too much stuff going on where I didn't want to follow (mild spoilers ahead): the main characters believe that fate is written in a loom, bullets can fly in circles, some men can accelerate to 200 m/h by foot and slow down their subjective time but don't see crosshairs on the floor, etc., etc.<br />My suggestion: save your time and money for better superhero movies like Spiderman, Batman, The Incredible Hulk, X-Men, etc., etc.
B005LAIIS0|2.0|An infuriating movie, full of some fine moments and at times, brilliant filmmaking. BUT it's still a pretentious half assed bore at times as well. For every great scene or moment, there's three more frustrating, unfinished scenes that are mired in self concious twaddle.<br /><br />It's almost as if the very talented Joe Carnahan started with an unfinished story and has blown it out with brooding, contemplative moments that only occasionally work. Ironically, had this been the man battling wolf thriller it was promoted as, it really might have been something.<br /><br />Thank God for Liam Neeson, it's his strong presence and natural gravitas that anchor this otherwise muddled experience, in fact without him it would be almost unwatchable.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I absolutely loves this game and would even pay for the app if some problems get fixed. I had to delete the app when I got to level 20 and start over cuz my timer reset on everything to over 200 hours!! That's insane and impossible to play. After starting all over I'm back up to level 25 and crossing my fingers tightly that my time doesn't reset itself like before. Also, I can't befriend anyone. My husband and I really enjoy competing with each other at this game but if these problems don't get fixed we will have to find another game.

I'm not even sure if I'll make it to the end as the new characters and plots don't hold much interest for me and the remaining portion is lagging as well.<br /><br />I hope book 5 is better than this...<br /><br />bah!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|honestly it was very boring. everything is real time based so to do anything you either have to wait forever or buy their pretend currency.  typical &quot;free 2 play&quot; game.
0345803485|3.0|As someone who has been actively reading fanfiction since high school (remember this book started as a fanfiction), I understand why this book is popular. It is very high-end among fanfiction...but the standard of \\"high-end\\" in fanfiction only means there's little to no grammar mistakes and the author actually finished the story.<br /><br />The tale of Christian and Anastasia is very unrealistic to take seriously if an average reader tried to base it on reality. It's acceptable in fanfiction because the standards are LOW but as a NY times bestseller? NO.<br /><br />If you like this kind of story, that's great! There's tons of these stories online for you to enjoy for free! For everyone else...DON'T BOTHER!!
B000JQUZCI|4.0|Took a few chapters to get into the book however certainly worth it. Good character development and enjoyed the build to the end.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I am about halfway through the Jack Reacher series and, in my opinion, this is by far the best one the author has written. I've been a little disappointed with a few of them because the identity of \\"who done it\\"  was so obvious to me early on in the book. Thus, the subsequent additional clues and mounting \\"drama\\" had me  screaming (silently) \\"oh, come on, this is so obvious\\"...<br /><br />Not with this book. I did think early on I probably knew who the bad guy was, but I was wrong this time. And although I did figure it out before the big reveal, I wasn't as sure of myself as I was in some of the other books.  The whole mystery element was much more cleverly woven into the story this time, I thought.<br /><br />Also, the dialogue in this book, i.e. the verbal interplay between characters, was far superior to any of the other Reacher novels I have read to date. Much more entertaining and had me chuckling several times.<br /><br />All in all, I loved this book...  highly recommend.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This Japanese animation about the afterlife, is truly a very OUTSTANDING MOVIE.  I won't write about the plot because many have already done so.  I just wanted you to know that if you really want to watch something different from a far away culture that is both beautiful and like a living colorful poem, well this movie is for you.  It is now part of my most precious movie collection.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|Not a bad movie and not very exciting either. But how many movies are based upon the same madman concept. A lot. There is some good acting with the exception of wooden Cruise. For $4 it's okay.

B001H1SW4M|5.0|I'm a fan of SAW. Not really scary to me but gross and bloody. Those are the best kind of horror movies. Great suspense too. Definitely a must have. I already have a copy of SAW but I purchased one from Amazon as a gift. Love the price.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|This movie was OK. It wouldn't come anywhere near my list of favorites, but I couldn't say I hated it, either. I like disaster movies, and science-fiction, and it may have been the Planet of the Apes knock-off cover art that helped draw me in. It wasn't that bad, but... I was turned off from the very beginning. I really don't care for the Blair Witch type style of filming, but I think it worked a little better for this movie. In any case, it didn't make me quite as dizzy. The other problem with the beginning was that it was just, well... pointless. I think it was supposed to make us get to know and care about the characters, but it didn't. At least not for me. To me, they came across as college-age brats who do nothing but drink and party.<br /><br />Oh well. The movie got better once the action started. I have the normal complaints, like the biggest one: nothing was ever explained, even by the end. I didn't think that was too bad, though, because of the whole \\"perspective\\" thing. (Although I would still like to know! After all, we are viewers, not participants.) How about when they went to save the girl and climbed 57 stories? No one does that and still speaks in complete sentences when they reach the top! If they even make it to the top. They were breathing hard at 37, but then at 57 they were all just fine. Well, maybe they were avid hikers, right? Haha. Overall, not too bad, but not really a movie I would recommend.

B007V5CF5K|5.0|Bought this game first time and was unable to download it.  Second time was more luck - maybe they fixed something, I don't know.  The game is absolutely amazing.  Requires a lot of thinking at times, but still lots of fun. I stuck on the machine code and had to use a cheat.  The catch is that you have to add or deduct \\"corrected numbers\\" to the original given by the \\"ancestors\\" and then enter them on the machine.  Also with safes in  the final episode, you need to try 3-digits code on each of the safe.  Once you found the right one for the one, move to next one and try the rest 2 codes.  The safe should be open.<br />great grafs, great story line, very witty and amusing.<br />2 thumbs up!

YES!(Shouty capitals) that would be the perfect Mr. Grey.<br /><br />There is so much MORE to the story than the sex, a must read.<br /><br />Have a glass of Champagne, nibble some Godiva and ENJOY
B000GFLE1S|5.0|The cast is super. The idea was a little predictable, but as the movie moves, you can really relate to the employees. The comedy is spot on and a lot of fun. I love this movie. I tell everyone about it. I let them watch my copy, and they all come back LOVING it! Great British comedy.
B003Z4JQGW|3.0|Keen Newport sandals are great for the most part. Good fit, comfortable and versatile.<br /><br />I purchased one <6months ago and used it twice - a beach trip and a hiking trip and i followed the care instructions afetr both the trips. I noticed yesterday that the stitches seem to be coming off on the backstrap. I am definitely going to contact Keen to let them know and see how they can help me.(i will keep you posted)<br /><br />I am disappointed with the quality of stitches. A footwear designed mostly for rugged outdoor type of usage should not have this issue.

B000TEUSJK|3.0|This is by far one of the most deranged films I have ever watched. It's hard to believe that Malcom Mcdowell and many other popular actors agreed to be in this movie. Unlike many other films about Caligula, this one is not afraid to hide the facts about the psychtic disorders, sexual lunacy, and violence towards innocent people.<br /><br />Caligula exclaims at one point, \\"If only all Rome had just one neck!\\" (in referecnce to be-heading).<br /><br />Seriously, this movie is over-the-top sexy, downright violent and twisted, yet at the same time, tells a brilliant story of the rise and fall of one of the most notorious riulers that ever lived.
1591844096|3.0|I agree with most of what Godin says, although not for reasons he makes clear.  To begin with he seems to be arguing that it todays economy if you are not a creative problem solver then you will not likely prosper. This is good advice; when a $ 500 nail gun can drive 43000 nails per hour, no one needs run of the mill hammer swingers on a construction site anymore, and computers have created a similar situation in many white collar jobs. But Godin is urging us to be more than just creative problem solvers in the workplace. He wants us all to be true to our personal artistic urges and finally use our humanity to make a difference in the lives of others.  When we do this we become a lynchpin and life will be great. The subtext is that we can all become Steve Jobses or Bill Gateses.  However, I see three diferent types of lynchpins in the book each with different rewards. The creative problem solver in the workplace is the first type and it is definately usefull for career sucsess these days. However, probably many such creative problem sovlers also helped design Auchwitz. The second type of lynchpin is true to his art. This is just as likely to bring poverty and obscurity as it is to bring fame and fortune, and many great artists and philosophers were never recongized in thier lifetimes. And the third type of lynchpin is true to thier humanity, and this can often lead to death. For every Nelson Mandella, Vaclav Havel or Tuva Belski, thousands or millions of brave and noble soals perished in obscurity.  I believe it is worthwhile stiving to by a lynchpin in all the senses described by Godin and have often strived to do so. But to expect that being a lynchpin in the second two senses will bring fame and fortune is to court bitterness and disapointment in life. Indeed there are times when life calls on us to be a moral lynchpin, such as when careing for an elderly relative, helping a child through a learning disability or saving a broken family from collapse, that will never bring us any tangible reward, and sometimes the people who benefit most from these instances will never even know what we did for them.  Such efforts can even draw us away from the more glamourous artistic and career pursuits often described in Godin's examples of the lynchpin life. These efforts however are still worth it, simply not for reasons Godin makes clear.  If Godin wants to become a moral philosopher, and with his tallent I am sure his contributions would be welcome,  he needs to put more emotional work into his art.

B007549W62|2.0|I gotta hand it to little known Director Xavier Gens...He got great performances from his skeleton crew cast in The Divide. Unfortunately, the vision that Gens had his cast acting out was a very pessimistic view of human emotion and behavior. So while the acting and direction were really good, the plot was so over the top with such unbelievable scenarios that it made the movie one of the worst I've seen all year.<br /><br />Nuclear bombs are raining down on The City, and you hastily make your way down from your apartment flat to the basement of your complex. You arrive at the basement door just in time to stop the building super from locking himself into a shelter and you out. You make it into the shelter with about 7 or 8 other building tenants. And...you would have been better off letting the bombs get you. Because it turns out that the other people who were neighboring with you in the building are mostly insane, irrational and incapable of a decent moral thought.<br /><br />What's that mean? Well just ask yourself: Would you like to be locked in a small shelter indefinitely in a group of almost a dozen with even just one person that was mostly insane, irrational and incapable of a decent moral thought? Let the inhumanities begin: Murder, torture, rape, mindless cruelty...just awful. Like an apocalyptic [[ASIN:B000EHRVP6 Hostel]]. Then to top it all off, during about mid-movie we learn that some sophisticated military lab has been built above the basement (When? How? What!!!) in place of the nuclear bomb devastated apartment building, and the military unit running the lab are as hostile (no pun intended) as some of the nuts inside the shelter.<br /><br />I will say that the decent acting and the suspense of what crazy, atrocity would happen next kept me watching. As I said earlier, the cast took their parts very seriously. But, I mean, for a small room of people to resort to a such violent, [[ASIN:B003ZD9DUC Mad Max]] dictatorship from practically the first shout of \\"action\\" by Director Gens was beyond extreme and completely unbelievable to me. And this unnecessarily took away what could have been done in a much more believable way.of \\"action\\" by Director Gens was beyond extreme and completely unbelievable to me.

B003PIUC02|5.0|I discovered this show about a month ago when watching an episode from a STARs preview.  I chose to watch season 1 through Netflix.  Loved it so much that I bought it on Bluray before I finished it.  Andy was the perfect Spartacus and it was a major loss for the world.  He would have been beautiful in Season 2 and gone on to do so many other things.  I watched the prequal which introduced Gannicus.  That is definately worth watching too and reveals some interesting details about the characters.  I have preordered Season 2.  I have seen a few clips and since the first episode I saw was the last episode I saw, I know that Season 2 will be intriging.  Again, whether you like the new spartacus or not, it is worth watching from the beginning.  No show has ever interested me enough to actually buy it or want to buy the second season without seeing it entirely first.  In one month, I have watched the first season 3 times and learn more each time I watch it.  This is definately money worth spent.  I only wish that Andy had lived long enough to show the world his talent.  But there are always plenty of men to dream about in this show.  I enjoyed the visual effects as well.  The writers are very creative and the actors are fabulous.  I hope this series continues for awhile.  It is the best show that I have seen in a long time.  I have to admit....this is not a show that I would have been drawn to normally.  It definately holds my attention.

B001QL5MAA|5.0|This is my first venture into Alistair Reynolds and I will buy every book he has written or will write.  But some things just struck me as hilariously funny.  Far into the future they still use glass?!  Leather?!  They still smoke cigarettes, the most inefficient way to get chemicals into the blood stream?  C'mon Mr Reynolds.  These are not believable.  We can swallow all sorts of futuristic weapons, cyborgs, etc. but some of the details like the above need attention.  Anachronistic in the extreme.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didn't want to see the film because I don't like the fundamental premise of kids forced to kill kids.  I decided that reading the books might Not be so graphic, so bought them for my kindle.

B000LN7HUC|5.0|I have been doing research and building all kinds of stoves for the last year. As far as weight, simmer ability, being compact, and total cooking speed, this is the greatest since sliced bread. In one small package I have the ability to cook at least 2 meals or even simmer a meal for up to an hour. I even tried to go with the wood gas stoves but this is as good as it gets. I wish the lifting handle would have been stronger but this one works.
0143121006|5.0|Midnight in Peking is a well written and interesting book.  It's also a quick read at 240 pages or so.  The publishers have a website where you can go get additional information about Peking in the 1930's.  The author has done an outstanding job of condensed writing.  Many of his references will lead the curious to ask, \\"Where I can learn more about that?\\"  And the website is there with maps, charts, lists of books etc.<br /><br />There was only one  howler in the text which almost put me off.  Early on the author describes the \\"Legation Quarter\\" in Peking as \\"2 acres\\".  The story then goes along and you've got a couple of hotels, a train station, several roads, multiple embassies etc.  Well a proofreader/editor living in Manhattan may not have the slighest concept of what an \\"acre\\" is.  Those of us living in suburbs out in flyover land  know that a 1/4 acre --sometimes slightly more--sometimes slightly less is the size of an average residential subdivision lot.  So 8 homes in Levittown sit on 2 acres of ground.<br /><br />A little research on the website showed that the Legation Quarter (the foreign compound in Colonial Peking) covered two square miles of ground.  For you Manhattan apartment dwelling editors, you were only off by a factor of 640 (the number of acres in a square mile).  Put another way, the Legation Quarter occupied about 150% as much space as Central Park (843 acres)<br /><br />Still read it--that howler aside, it's an excellent well researched and completely believable book.
B005LAJ22Q|3.0|I love all things zombie and thought season one of the Walking Dead was good and showed a lot of promise for the series. Then season two came out and the creators seemed to forget this was a horror show and made it a soap opera. They camped at the farm for the whole season and you had to wade through episode after episode of painful whining and dragged out emotional scenes like you would on a daytime soap. What saved the show from being a complete snooze was the last few episodes where things started to pick-up.<br /><br />Something snapped in the writers heads and they remembered that the zombies are the real stars of the show and they were brought back into the fold. So instead of an episode where they toss in the token zombie to wake up the viewers and remind us that a zombie apocalypse happened, the dead started springing up and became the driving force for the characters decision making.<br /><br />No spoilers here, but the final episode showed some promise and introduced a really eerie/cool looking character that perked my interest. So I will stick with the show and see how season three plays out. I really hope they drop some of the drama and make the characters actions and behaviors mimic how they would act in the aftermath of an extreme supernatural apocalypse. I'm sorry but watching Glenn after everything he has been through clam up like a whimpering little kid when a woman wants to kiss him just doesn't fly. If anything he should be saying, \\"Give me some sugar baby!\\" This is what made Shane's character so awesome, he had depth and you saw him transform into a person hell bent on survival, he realized the situation and tried to change to match the new way of life.<br /><br />The Walking Dead is worth watching. It does have some pitfalls (mainly American writers trying to plug family values and human emotion on a milquetoast level instead of making cutting edge terror/horror, something American Horror Story does well at), but the show does have a lot of potential and I think they ended season two on a positive note. I'll give it another season to see if they can deliver on that. If it doesn't, I'm such a zombie junky I might watch it anyways, but without very much enthusiasm. Basically TiVo and view it when there was nothing else to watch.

1576875776|5.0|I recently received the first book regarding the work of the virtually unknown street photographer, Vivian Maier.  She did this as a hobby and after going through this book, she definitely had talent far beyond just another person walking around with their camera taking candid pictures.  She amassed over 100,000 photos in her lifetime - which is mind boggling to me.  This first book, of which I hope there will be many more, is a gem!  There has been some criticism over the overly sepia tone of the photos, but in my version it has been toned down considerably.  It's almost a neutral gray or black and white, but not quite.  Unless of course my eyes are going bad.  This is an amazing book of her work and a thousand thanks (ok, a million thanks) goes out to John Maloof for rescuing her negatives and presenting them in this book

I have bought 4 of these including the red one and while this one does a better cleaning job and has a better battery life than the red, they both die way too young! None of the 4 have lasted more than a year. That's enough money down the drain. Their lifespan is anywhere from 1 month to 9 months and this is with light use! Right now I am using a rubber broom on my wood floors. I am hoping to find a quality electric sweeper that works great, is affordable and lasts more than a year.

1402770006|4.0|I enjoyed the matte full color artwork of the story.  Certainly, it was obvious the author had stayed true to the Doyle work and did not give into temptation to modernize the dialog or settings. That dedication is both the best and worst part of the grapic novel: the book, when shorn of the imagination when the brain translates everything from page, tends to become very dry.<br /><br />The artwork felt very 1940s Dick Tracy: a lot of small eyes and square jaws. I'm not quite sure that film noir type of artwork suits an Edwardian storyline.  I would have much preferred to see the sinewy art nouveau motif rather than the strong 1930s/40s deco drawings.  It feels too anachronistic and takes away from the setting of the story for me.<br /><br />In all, it's well done and is a neat literary introduction to a classic book.  The soul and inspiration of Doyle's book is there in the writing - I only wish the artwork (which isn't bad at all) had also stayed true to the milieu.
B00812W9QM|5.0|This is Mad Men at its finest. I've always admired the episodes that are more philosophical in nature and this one, besides being gripping and entertaining, has so much depth in the storytelling.  I had a visceral reaction to the longing of several characters.  And the portrayal of more open emotions Megan's youth and approach to life elicits from Don was just stunning when you recall the Don of several years back and his complete blindness to Betty's inner plight.

B007CBX61U|1.0|I purchased this movie after a long search for a compatable region.  Upon receipt, I attempted to run the Blu-Ray movie but the blu-ray player identified it as having \\"the wrong format\\".  I then called Panasonic, who walked me through the firmware update and said that the player was designed to play in region A or A/B/C and that it should now work if the movie is as advertised. It didn't.  Another movie I just purchased this week having been released last week, plays just fine. Panasonic said it was the disc that was faulty or the format was not as advertised.  I will just have to wait until the US decides at some point to release Miss Potter for a local audience.  I have returned the item for a full refund as \\"not as advertised\\".

So I was redirected to here from Sony's website when looking for an extra controller. I was worried that it would be a clone or copy due to the packaging being different but it arrived with the standard Sony blue box packaging not the white and blow mold plastic ones you see pictured.

B005S9EJ14|3.0|The easiest way to describe this film is by saying it's about a group of British old people making a fool of themselves in India. That's essentially the film in one sentence, but also doesn't really seem fair in the long run.<br /><br />Seven retirees from Britain all decide to travel to India for different reasons. Muriel (Maggie Smith) is having hip surgery, Douglas (Bill Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton)'s daughter invested their life savings into a get rich quick scheme that still hasn't paid off, Evelyn (Judi Dench) is looking for a change in scenery after her husband has passed, Graham (Tom Wilkinson) grew up in India and is looking forward to returning there, Madge (Celia Imrie) is looking for a rich suitor who can make her feel like a desirable woman again, and Norman (Ronald Pickup) is just lonely and looking for that particular someone to make the last few years of his life worth living. With the low cost and exotic scenery of India enticing them, they all decide to stay at the newly restored Marigold Hotel. Unfortunately things aren't as advertised and the hotel is still undergoing massive renovations when they arrive. While the trip they wind up taking doesn't end up being the one they planned, it evolves into something they never could have counted on and are forever affected by their stay there.<br /><br />The most unique thing about The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is that everyone has different personalities. Everybody seems to be so different from one another on the surface, but are much more alike underneath than they could have ever imagined. Muriel is the most surprising, especially if you've only seen Maggie Smith in the Harry Potter franchise. Her ignorant racist comments result in some of the most memorable scenes in the film. Douglas felt like the character I related to the most (I'm sure it'll probably be different for everyone). His tendency to stay quiet the majority of the time, but then blow everyone away with his sarcastic wit reminded me quite a bit of myself. Graham seemed very private at first, but the film immediately becomes more sentimental once he reveals why he actually came back to India. Evelyn's journey is the most emotional.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. At first it was a little hard getting into it - its written from a 5 year olds point of view - but once I got adjusted, I couldn't put it down. Really interesting and good read.
0345803485|2.0|Disclaimer: I typically do not read books in the romance/erotic genre. I will admit that this is a rather quick, engaging story, but reads like a draft instead of a final, polished novel. Other comments as listed:<br /><br />- It seems implausible for a 21-year-old girl with no strong religious beliefs to be so sexually inexperienced.  She has never even held hands with a boy until Christian.<br />- It seems implausible that a grown woman would fall twice (once into his office, once almost in front of the cyclist)in a short period of time, but seemingly not have any other accidents after that (is she clumsy or not?).<br />- It seems implausible that a man like Christian Grey would become completely smitten with a girl like Ana.<br />- The names are throwing me off as well. Anastasia, Elliot, Kavanaugh, and even Christian are not very common names in the US.<br />- It is unbelievable that a woman would have graduated from college in the US without a computer/email address/online presence (Facebook, etc).  She writes about emailing as if it is a novelty.<br />- The writing is repetitive, as mentioned above - the inner goddess, the subconscious, biting the lips, quirking, referring to her body parts as \\"my sex,\\" clambering, envisages, crap, holy hell, holy crap, etc, etc -- it's like the author thinks of a word and then keeps on using it.<br />- The comparisons with Twilight are unavoidable.  It is almost the exact same story.<br /><br />It makes me sad that Ana would be considered a heroine or even a character that modern women would relate to. Why are inexperience, weakness, desperate neediness and clumsiness characteristics that are presented in a positive, endearing light?  Very confused about this. Ana would likely get on my nerves in real life.  A few chapters in, I actually had to do an internet search to find out what the deal was with this book.  I honestly cannot  believe this is a final draft that that it has become so popular.  Clearly I am not the target audience.

B007DIQC90|5.0|The XX meets Arcade Fire with a little Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes thrown in.  I like!  The radio-played \\"Little Talks\\" isn't even the best song in the album (though it may be the funnest).

B007BLCGNU|3.0|John Edgar Hoover was a fascinating, powerful, complicated and compelling figure. He was one of the most powerful--and certainly longest serving--high position agency heads in US history (and considering his power over time, arguably the most powerful American in the 20th century). He was a closested homosexual who persecuted others for being gay. He also lived with his conservative religious mother until he was in his 40s (while perhaps being a cross dresser). He was also an innovator, bring modern science to the FBI. He also mixed his personal ambitions with those of the agency and US. He was considered a master in blackmail, aiming his skill at eight presidents. In short, he was a seriously fascinating and twisted guy. So why isn't this film better? Hard to say.<br /><br />Leonardo D does a fine job--though it's a little distracting to not see him overlaid on J Edgar. But something didn't quite work about the film. Best I can say is that somehow we don't get real or deep insight into what motivated and moved him. Worth viewing for getting glimpse of J Edgar, but don't look for great art.

B00280LYHS|4.0|We start where we left off, and we abruptly are shaken from the attempted 'normal' summer that Percy is trying to have and thrown into the epic ending, and we finally get to find out the entire prophecy. I will tell you, there are surprises, but as well written as the series is you know how it's going to end...right...well generally. I am a little sad to see this series end, but happy still that there's another series that has started that involves our favorite demigods. This book is a must if you've read the first 4 books. I means you've read four books, you should find out how everything ends. I loved this rendition of Greek mythology, I think it's a clever way to get younger kids into the myths and history. I like that Riordan made kids with 'learning disabilities' (ADHD & Dyslexia) into hero's, after all everyone has something special about them and they can impact the world greatly, even if they have difficulties in some areas. I like how we wrapped up this series, and I hope to read more of Riordan's books in the future.
B00536OCZA|3.0|Simply put, why would one purchase a remastered version of DSOTM if it is remastered digitally and put on vinyl? Is not the whole point of a vinyl album but to encompass the original state of the art production that existed at that time and being able to enjoy that on virgin vinyl? I think it goes way too far a degree to accept remastered music, like Pink Floyd, when there was plenty of reasons why the original mastered recording was what it is. So, give me an original mastered recording on vinyl and I'd be quite happy to replace my old warped worn one. With respect to Original Mastered Recordings, superb, but how do they compare to a digitally remastered recording that is put on vinyl. Someone explain this to me, please.

0307592731|5.0|I finished this book in two days and was disappointed when it ended. Any author willing to put their life \\"out there\\" so honestly really shouldn't be judged for it. I was surprised at some of the harsh reviews. Cheryl didn't candy coat her life and I found that really refreshing. I admire her courage in not only undertaking such a journey to begin with, but sharing it with the world.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a very useful app. It comes handy for when you want to do something on your computer but your not there, just log in with your gmail account and boom, your looking at your Pc through your tablet or certain cell phone. I currently us this app on my kindle fire and it work great.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|This sequel was fantastic. Robert Downey does a great job of the logical and even sometimes bumbling nature of Sherlock Holmes. The graphics and grittiness if the film were captivating. Incorporating some steampunk was a nice touch.  While I do agree with other reviewers that ultraviolet isnt seemingly a digital copy, YOU DO HAVE THE OPTION TO DOWNLOAD A FULL DIGITAL COPY OF YOUR MOVIE THRIUGH FLIXSTER TO YOUR MOBILE DEVICE,PC OR LAPTOP AND ACCESS IT ANYTIME. To avoid cost, simply download this from the Airports wifi, starbucks, or other free Internet location. Don't knock the product when you don't know the full capacity if ultraviolet options. This movie was terrific and to deny it financial success because they want you to stream or download via an app is ridiculous. It may cost them more in bandwidth to have it streamed and downloaded from their server then to print you label and make a disc just to redeem it from itunes. I think ultraviolet is nice. You can retrieve a movie from wherever (yes very much like the cloud). Give this movie its due. Thanks!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is a great way to get all 8 of the Harry Potter films for an incredibly low price. The case that the movies come in is not made of the sturdiest materials, but that is hardly even worth mentioning. The movies themselves are perfect, and I love that they take up less space in our DVD stand. If you want a collectors item or a lot of extra features, you probably will want to purchase a different set, but if you just want to be able to enjoy the movies, I wouldn't pass this one up.

B0060D08JO|3.0|We love this movie!  My son watches it all the time.  After the DVD got scratched, I decided to buy the digital version so he couldn't scratch the disk again.  I am so disappointed.<br /><br />The volume is ridiculous.  In order to have it loud enough to hear the dialog, there is a buzzing sound in the background.  It also makes the sound effects louder than I would like.  I'll probably end up buying it on disc again.<br /><br />Buy the DVD or Blu-Ray for a great movie experience.  Avoid the downloadable version!<br /><br />Movie:  5 stars.  Version:  1 star.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|I really enjoyed Sister and was looking forward to the author's next book. I found the first half of the book a bit slow but I loved the second half - fast-paced and very moving on an emotional level. You have to be willing to go with the fact that it's spirits of some sort narrating the novel, if you can do that then I think you'll enjoy this novel.

B000MGVCFO|1.0|Note, this one-star rating is for the product, not the artist/music.<br /><br />Hoping that I would receive one from a previous production run, I placed an order anyway.  No such luck, mine does not play in standard or SACD players.<br />It looks to me like the bad ones started showing up just this year.  If you can be assured that yours is from an older production run, you are probably safe.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Ladies, Gentlemen, Boys and Girls,<br /><br />  I own over 10,000 LP's and 5,000 CD's.I am a collector. But not because, I want the big cash kill after years of hoarding the sweet rarity. I am a collector because I \\"listen\\" to a lot of music. I love music. I am studied, learned and very aware when I have a secret favorite album that doesn't really add up to the greatest record ever made. I have favorites purely for the sake of the fact that the music is played passionately played. Recorded truthfully, and performed with a sincerity that is undeniable.<br />\\" A Different Kind Of Truth\\"\\" Is a better Van Halen album than anything that was released by the Van Hagar lineup. Or the Gary Cherone fronted, \\"III\\".<br /><br />This album is also an album/CD that holds a power that I haven't heard from these guys since \\"Women And Children First\\".  Why?<br /><br />Well, G*U*I*T*A*R!!! Edward Van Halen is, as we all know one of the greatest guitarists in the history of Rock music. Robbie Kreiger from The Doors recently said that he was one of the only \\"after Doors\\" guitarist he truly admired.<br /><br />This album shows me that Eddie is in full throttle, \\"Look at me now\\" mode. He is incredible. The solos are raw, natural, original, tight and filled with pure Van Halen rhythm section power.This band is a 3-piece band with a front man. This album is an absolute, complete powerhouse of beyond Van Halen classic, rock.<br /><br />The irony of all of my praise is that I first saw them in 1980. The \\"Invasion 1980\\" Tour. Watched a few concert videos, etc. Never considered myself an \\"all worshipping\\" Van Halen fan.<br /><br />But out of a somewhat sentimental curiosity, I bought this album. I realized, I liked it. Then loved it. Like an epiphany. I got goose-bumps and totally was drawn in. I have listened to it constantly and feel that it is the Best Hard Rock Album of 2012. I feel it is deserving of extended notice, listen, and appreciation.<br /><br />At the end, I feel it deserves every award it is eligible to receive. Including a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Album. Or at least a nomination.<br /><br />I was 13 years old when I first heard them. I just bought a copy for my 12 year old nephew and he loves it.<br /><br />That holds up.<br /><br />So, Buy it. Listen to it. Don't worry about Michael Anthony not being on board. My nephew doesn't know about him. Though, I'll probably get him Chickenfoot to dig, for kicks.<br /><br />I prefer this album over those guys by far...and wide.<br /><br />Turn it up!!!! The Different Kind Of Truth is that this is great. For greatness sake.award it is eligible to receive. Including a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Album.

1609611543|2.0|I got this book to help with some issues I have suffered from wheat. I found this books scientific evidence a little over-sensualized. I was also very dissapointed to see tofu and fake sugar substitutes in the recipie section. As someone who had suffered from the effects of too much soy and its effects on estrogen I am surprise someone who has done research would advocate for this substitutes. This book completely lost my trust after this.

B000093BDX|5.0|\\"Sounds of Summer: Very Best of The Beach Boys\\" will bring back a flood of memories for those listeners who enjoyed The Beach Boys during their heyday.  For younger listeners, this CD should provide a fun, light-hearted glimpse into the music of their parents' or grandparents' youth.<br /><br />All The Beach Boys'familiar songs most familiar and most popular songs have been included on one CD.  Sound quality seems to be very good; there was no noticeable, to us, loss of depth in the vocals or instrumentation.  Some of the singles versions are not quite the way we remembered them as being, but that could be due to our memories rather than a difference in those songs.<br /><br />You will find yourself singing along while \\"Sounds of Summer: Very Best of The Beach Boys\\" is playing and reminiscing about the days when your biggest worries were schoolwork and whether the person you \\"like, liked\\" like, liked you back.
B004G600A4|5.0|My little grand-daughter loves this movie. I had it on TIVO in my bedroom and she would come in there and watch it every night.  I got to watch no TV, she has a DVD player in her playroom so I bought her the video for Easter.  Now she can watch whenever she wants and I get to watch my TV.<br /><br />This is a great movie.
0345803485|5.0|I just finished the 2nd book and I can't wait to read the 3rd book.  I am shocked at all the negatives reviews on this book.  It's a book if you don't like what the book has to offer then don't read it. Yes it is a \\"Erotic Romance book\\" and if you can't figure out what Erotic means then don't read it.  I think the author did an amazing job with this and I can't wait for more of her book to come out.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|First off, I love Britney Spears. She's my favorite artist. Now, Onto the review. To me, I love all the album but one song. (I'll get to that in a minute) even though most of the album is auto-tuned, I love the album. It's got dance, and pop mix. Now, to what I think of each song...<br /><br />1) 'Till The World Ends - Second single! I like this song, It's dancey and you can't get the verses out of your head. It's about enjoying the music until the world finally ends. The only thing that either ruins the song or becomes annoying to me, Is when she says \\"Whoa - Oh (6x)\\" Over and over. That's why I gave it a 9. 9/10<br /><br />2) Hold It Against Me - Album's first single. I love this song, It's my second favorite song. The song is about wanting a guy basically. I One of Britney's best to me. 10/10<br /><br />3) Inside Out - Third favorite track! I love thing song and it's mid tempo beat and the lyrics \\"Hit me one more time, It's so amazing/ How you shook my world and flipped it upside down/ You're the only one who drove me crazy/ 'Cause you know me/ Inside Out\\" Obviously it's about an ex hard to forget and hard to let go. 10/10<br /><br />4) I wanna Go - Third single! Overall I like this song. The song is about wanting to do your own thing and not what people expect you to do. even though there are outrageous and crazy expectations. I like the verses very much, But the chorus is okay. I wished it coulda been a bit longer. After while, I got bored with it. I still like it though 8/10<br /><br />5)How I Roll - This one is.. Ehh, It's alright. Not my cup of tea but it's okay. I like how it starts though but that's about it. Not the greatest song on the album but it's good. It's about going out on the town, with friends and partying. 5/10<br /><br />6) (Drop Dead) Beautiful - Fourth favorite. I love the song. It has spunk, and a new singer named Sabi. Sabi's part is overly auto-tuned. That's why I'm going to give it a 9. Obviously, this song is about liking a guy. And he's \\"Drop Dead Beautiful\\" 9/10<br /><br />7) Seal It With A Kiss - Pretty good song. I have to be in a mood to listen to this song though. But overall, Good song, Good vocals, Good verses and chorus. Again, about another guy she sees at a party or some gathering. and She wants him. 8/10<br /><br />8) Big Fat Bass (Feat. Will.I.Am) - I can SO pass on this song. I don't really like it. I mean, sure Will.I.Am is featured but it's not.. Awesome. It's kinda annoying. Some people like it, and that's their opinion. :) But it's not for me. I tried, but I couldn't get myself to like it. Good vocals though. 3/10<br /><br />9) Trouble For Me - Another okay song. At least I can listen to this song better than B.F.B. Verses are good. Chorus.. Alright. It's about liking someone who is trouble but for everyone else, he's not. 7/10<br /><br />10) Trip To Your Heart - Nice & Pretty. Kinda a ballad, but yet it's not. Get what I mean? It has Britney's pretty vocals except when they go all auto tuned on us in the chorus. 7/10<br /><br />11) Gasoline - I was in love with this song when I first heard it, Then over the months, I got tired of it. I love the song though. \\"Spark/ And it's like gasoline/ I start/ Pumping like a machine/ My heart/ Only runs on supreme/ So hot/ Gimme your gasoline/\\" Again, auto tuned. 8/10<br /><br />12) Finally!! My FAVORITE track. Criminal - I love Criminal. I can still listen to this song over and over again. I love Britney's voice in the song. Not that much auto tune. Is it just me or am I the only one who likes to hear Britney's ACTUAL voice. Not computer altered. This song is about loving a bad boy and telling mama, It's alright, I'll be fine. \\"Mama I'm in love with a criminal/ And this type of love/ Isn't rational/ It's physical/ Mama, Please don't cry/ I will be alright/ all reason aside/ I just can't deny/ I love the guy/\\" Great song. My favorite on the whole album. Criminal closes the standard edition 10/10<br /><br />*Bonus Track review*<br /><br />13)Up N' Down - My favorite bonus track. It's a sexy song. I think we all know what this song means here. Great beats, Great chorus, And awesome vocals. xD 10/10<br /><br />14) He About To Lose Me - This song is nice, I like the whole song even though it's auto tuned frequently. It's about a lover who doesn't see her needs and she's getting tired of it. So He's about to lose her. 9/10<br /><br />15) Selfish - A cool Song! It's about taking reversed turns and taking control for a night. My favorite line out of the whole song and most people agree is \\"Boom, Boom Baby/ Pick you up in my Mercedes/\\" I like. 10/10<br /><br />16) Don't keep Me waiting - Like another reviewer stated, It's an oddball song. I wouldn't know how to describe this song.. It's pretty good. 9/10<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this album. Some people didn't. And some people did. It really just depends on what you like. I hope my review helped.Up N' Down - My favorite bonus track. It's a sexy song. I think we all know what this song means here.

0439023513|1.0|First of all, let me say I am a huge fan of the first two Hunger Games Books. However, this book is the worst conclusion to a great story that one could imagine. The entire book focuses on the inner thoughts of a whinny, self-centered, weak minded alter ego of the once great character that was Katniss Everdine. Panem becomes the scene of a completely lifeless story. Spoiler: Prim dies suddenly and for no good reason. Gale goes off to who knows where. Petta becomes a, I don't even know... a mutt. Haymitch is worthless. Nothing is realy explained very well. I lost interest about half way through the book but kept reading in hopes it would get better. It doesn't. Everything fizzles out. All the characters loose their appeal, Katniss in particular. The story goes nowhere for 90% of the book. How can someone write that much about nothing? In the end, I was left angry and unsatisfied. This is a worse let down than the last three Star Wars films combined... might as well throw Indiana Jones in there too. I wish now that I had never read the books and just watched the movies. I hope for everyone's sake that the screen writers for this last book just make an entirely different story line. Really, this is a terrible book.
B003D8KH9A|4.0|Enjoyed the pool and cover. Good Quality. But it has no drain plug so I had to use a bucket to empty it out as wasnt in a spot where I could just push the water out to drain it.  Lesson learned.
0345803485|1.0|I fell for the hype and purchased all three of these books. Big mistake. They are thinly veiled ripoffs of Twilight (also awful) and Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse books (awful but more entertaining than these). I don't understand why so many women are swooning over these poorly written, trite stories. The main character has no identity of her own; she is defined entirely by the way men want her. So frustrating!
B007SGM084|5.0|I started out just buying the first book to see what the hype was all about. I was intrigued by it. I will admit that it was very intense and leaves very little to the imagination when it comes to sex but that doesn't bother me. I just fell in love with the \\"love\\" between Christian and Anastasia. I think it turned into a wonderful love story. Unraveling the past of Christian Grey was so intense. I just could not put this book down. I bought the first and then I had to immediately buy the second and third. I am actually in the process of reading it again b/c I was that moved by it. I think the ending was great! I am not much of a reader but I just got sucked into this book and it consumed me. I know everyone has different opinions on what is good but my opinion is this book is just amazing. I give it 5 stars all the way!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I purchased this game for my kindle fire and my iphone. It's very easy to use and very addicting. I highly recommend it.
0735327793|5.0|My daughter loves the very hungry caterpillar and loves to do this puzzle. The colors are very beautiful. My daughter is 2 1/2 and has a little trouble since the pieces look very similar. Very good for a child a little bit older or for a young child with a little guidance from an adult.
B001AOKA3W|2.0|The director does a facile job of creating tension. That's really the only positive I can assign to this movie. Most of our time was spent by a bunch of stereotypically irresponsible twentysomethings partying and then screaming, \\"Oh my God,\\" \\"What was that?\\" and \\"What's going on?\\" We didn't really see anything gelling until, oh, the last fifteen minutes. IMHO, Cloverfield ranks up there with The Blair Witch Project in the \\"much ado about nothing\\" department.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I'm a newer runner, but this watch has completely changed my running attitude. This watch, or AT LEAST a GPS watch, is a must have for all runners. I never realized how helpful a watch like this would be.<br /><br />This watch is quite accurate when it comes to measuring out your runs. You will see how far you have run displayed on the screen as well as your total time, and your current pace. The current pace feature is life-saving. It helps me keep a constant pace when racing or helps me improve my pace time when training. This watch is very simple to set up and if you like playing with technology there are a lot of details you can adjust. You can pick what all shows on your training display screen. If heart rate is important to you, you can set your heart rate on the screen. Other options being things like current pace, average pace, calories burned, and distance. I have definitely improved as a runner due to this watch and would encourage everyone to get it. It is totally worth the $200.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'd heard a lot about Hugh Howey's \\"Wool\\" stories and finally decided to check them out. I'm glad I bought the omnibus edition, because if I'd read the first on its own I wouldn't have continued--not because it's badly written, but because I don't \\"do\\" bleak well. Perserverance paid off. This is one of the best modern books I've read this year (I read a lot of classics). Howey's writing is clean, he knows how to move a plot right along, he keeps you guessing, and he gives you a payoff at the end. Fine storytelling.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Its fun to play with friends and family.<br />It gets very addicting! I can't stop playing.<br />I highly recommend this game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|luv it and so does my before this game is just like mario it is so much fun and u know
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Beware! This series is addictive. I started with the first book and then couldn't rest until I had downloaded the entire series and read them one after the other. It is full of blood, sex and death, so much death. Reading about what these characters go through from the safety of your home makes you so grateful to be alive. The characters are so finely drawn, the scenes so beautifully rendered that one can imagine the smell and run with the Stark wolves. Even the fantastical elements seem quite gritty and real and never veer into that uncomfortable territory of fantasy. These books span genres and carve out their own place in literature. Don't miss them.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This was a super easy install.  Take out the old, drop in the new.  I have a Gigabyte GA-MA790X-UD4P motherboard.  I was surprised at how loud the fan is, but I've gotten used to it.  Oh another nice convenience was that the thermal adhesive was already on the heatsink.  In all it took me about 5 minutes to install and 5 minutes to clean the old CPU and heatsink for re-use elsewhere.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great so far. hopefully the freemium stuff doesn't get too intrusive. but definitely worth the download. give it a go. its free!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game it is got great graphics and u can get all of the main characters.  it also gives u great goal to keep u interested.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good read, still reading through it. Not going through it like I was the first one. The first Hunger Games book I couldn't put down, but this one I close up when my eyes get tired. Some of the things that are happening are predictable. Not sure If I'm going to read the last one.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app. its good to play with friends on fb and its great on of:)<br />u must get this app
B007SGM084|5.0|I have now read this trilogy twice and plan to read it again. The books are so detailed I felt like I was part of every moment. It is intense, hot, romantic, and just plain sexy. My only downside has been trying to find any book after that could match up ;) E. L. James has gained a loyal fan of her work.<br /><br />I can understand people thinking this trilogy is expensive but trust me when I say it is well worth every penny.
0887431453|4.0|I am a stay at home Mom (SAHM) of 2 and we took my son out of private preschool because we were literally paying for him to get sick.  It was not cost effective for us.  He is very smart and I have taught him a lot using unconventional methods.  Now that he will attend public Kindergarten, I needed him to learn the way he would in school.  He enjoys this book but he isn't the type to love the coloring part and there is too much for him.  Other than that, he really does like it.  I bought another one for my youngest (22 months) and will let her use it when she gets a bit older.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a very fun game...the kids.love it!!!  they sit for hours at a time and take turns playing it.  great entertainment for free!!!
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I was disappointed to receive this case.  It's just a plastic shell with a layer of bifolded plastic over the top.  The plastic layer doubles as a cover and a back stand.  It would allow crumbs and dirt to enter. The back stand is not stable.<br /><br />I'm returning it for another case from another manufacturer.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I am a new proud owner of this album. Gotye is a unique talented artist. His music is true art and refreshing. WARNING...wearing headphones during this album is eargasmic.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I love it when I read a new sci fi and the entire concept is new and somewhat believable. Great read.
B0054EZ6JM|5.0|This particular story and history of the Doctor carried the episode... and mind you with double the fun this episode it didn't fail to please.
0345803485|1.0|Boring, poorly written, and a total waste of time ... and money. UGH!I honestly don't understand the hype. The characters are boring, shallow, and OMG - Ana is soooooooooooooooo annoying. Seriously, if you want steamy sex scenes, read erotica. At least you know what you're getting.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Makes finding and downloading books so easy. Great selection and very reasonally priced. Lots are free. Includes magazines, too. Best source for reading I've found.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|One of the best mini series made of all time.... This show result his home and it isn't made up in a cops tongue. Someone with true hands on experience.
B004I744AS|5.0|I tried this app and absolutely love it's ease of use.  I also enjoy the extras it offers like what happened on this date in history. I appreciate that the extras sre present but that they don't get in the way of getting the definition of a word quickly and concisely. I really love this app!
1594484805|4.0|I completely agree with most of the information presented in this book. It should be an obligatory reading for all company executives and anyone wishing to lead or use the work of others.<br />The reason for giving 4 stars is that in my opinion, the author should have spent some time explaining or giving some examples, on how the \\"autonomy\\" principle can work with the employees who do not have the type of education and knowledge to be able to work completely independently, and 'own' their ideas. For example, an engineer or a scientist may develop a creative idea on how to build a new product or a technology. He needs to pass this onto people who are his technical assistants, to help put the devised model into practice. I cannot imagine how you can give a technician a map or a scientific protocol, and then tell him \\"this is just an outline, but feel free to experiment and come up with idea on your own on how to do it\\". This can work only with highly trained and/or educated people, who you can fully trust will be able to deal with the task. But having someone less experienced and qualified, play around and learn by making mistakes, while you are waiting for the results (and have other people on board who can do it faster), is probably not the best option for the companies with a competitive business strategy. Maybe the answer is in matching task level and the autonomy level with the work experience, education and the right talent? Maybe this should be the material for the Pink's next book.
1401937268|3.0|I really enjoy many of Doreen Virtue's books and card decks. I was looking forward to this deck for awhile, as the two Tarot decks I currently use are great, I was wanting something a bit different. The cards themselves are absolutely beautiful! LOVE the artwork! I'm not a big fan of having \\"meanings\\" printed on the face of the cards though, as I feel for each reading or each individual, the cards can have different interpretations and this tends to confuse, or sometimes worry my clients if my interpretation is a bit different than what they are seeing on the card. My BIGGEST dislike of the cards is just that...they are so BIG! I guess the cards themselves really aren't all that huge, but the deck together is extremely thick for a tarot deck. If I want to use the deck fully, with all the cards, both the major and minor arcana, as I normally would, they are very large and cannot be shuffled easily. Sadly, these are not cards I am able to use on a regular basis with my clients. Thank you Doreen for the beautiful cards, but please consider sizing on future decks. The few other oracle card decks of Doreen's I have are not as awkward in size.
B00723NWJE|1.0|I've listened to this album three times start to finish.  It is terrible!  I take it she's airing her dirty linen in public as it is a revenge work against some former lover (Lee Alexander?)<br /><br />First, her producer ruined her voice with excessive and oppressive reverberation bordering on echo.  Her sweet voice is what people buy her works for - why hack it? There's far too much synthesizer in the accompaniment too.<br /><br />Second, some of the lyrics are over-the-top hostile - \\"Miriam\\" has her fantasing about murdering her romantic rival.  Her piece \\"She's 22\\" is nasty bitter about losing to a younger woman.  And Jones is, what?, 32?<br /><br />A poor choice of producer who hides her greatest asset and a bileful set of lyrics, bitter to the point of indigestion makes for a huge letdown and a waste of money on my part.<br /><br />What the heck happened to the sweet ingenue of \\"Come Away With Me?\\"  Frankly, if you're going to start acting that hateful, I can't blame the guy for dumping you.  It will take an emotional turnaround before I buy another Jones product.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it love it love it!!!! itdoes have a couple messups like it sometimes freezes but hopefully they will do an upgrade soon.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game to play. reminds me of a game we would play in grade school! Brings back some fun memories.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|5+3=8 divided by 2 = 4. If you're looking for a fun, fast paced, action adventure, comic book superhero movie, then The Avengers is the movie most definitely to see. Recommendations are to see it in IMAX 3D or just regular 2D. Some people told me the regular screen 3D wasn't good. I don't know, I'm just relaying. I can say the IMAX 3D was absolutely amazing. Crystal clear, in your face, you felt like the whole theatre was moving 3D. By now most of you have heard the big plus of this movie is they finally got the Hulk right. I can most certainly attest to that. The 2003 Hulk was too regular guy looking (In the face that is) and the 2008 hulk had the better physique, but looked like a pretty boy. This Hulk looks as he should. Another thing I was impressed with was the massively improved CGI effects and what appeared to be the use of stunt actors in as many scenes as possibly instead of over using the CGI to the point where the characters look like video games like in previous Marvel movies. SPOILER WARNING: Now I'm not going to write spoilers for what's in this movie. I'm going to write spoilers for what's lacking in this movie. So If you haven't seen The Avengers yet STOP READING NOW! Or continue at your own risk. The one thing this movie failed to do was give me a sense of nail biting, on the edge of my seat, nervous suspense, rapid heart thumping \\"This villain is so evil, where are the heroes to save us excitement\\" Like they did in Superman II (Still The greatest comic book superhero movie champion) with General Zod and his two hench persons. Fans of that movie know exactly what I'm talking about. You see, even though a threat is mentioned early in the movie, the audience never gets a chance to experience any sense of impending doom before the Avengers start to assemble. Because of this the excitement of The Avengers was based on the action you were seeing moment by moment on the screen, but never really had that intense build up of anticipation.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Very addicting, but I feel cheated by the game flaws resetting my buildings to unrealistic production hours.  Also experienced the products disappearing, and cash suddenly lost $2 (only a big deal because that is 66% of what it was!). Even when energy is fully recharged or you pay $10 to buy energy, it only lasts about 10 minutes.  That's pretty expensive game play for a wild west version of Farmville. Hoping for updates fast to fix problems.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this App is more!!! love it!! absolutely love everything about this App. the versatility With all of the options as far as which Bible form you want to read or which plan youvwant to fallow.  It's just simple and yet works fluidly.
0385335482|4.0|This is a fresh entertaining read, especially for someone who is a lover of shopping to read about someone who is much worse and has it totally out of perspective. It is like reading about a hilarious SNL skit that is hysterical and makes you laugh out loud with a plot behind it you can follow. Great read!  Loved it, and will read more by her for sure!
B005HESLNW|5.0|Just watch it!  Great Questions!  Excellent performances.  Maybe I'm a snob, but I feel like this episode (and the series in general) makes me feel pretty bad about what is currently broadcast via television.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing Oregon trails this is one game I can let the kids play with me. I just wish there was a way to get more cash and energy.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I cried off and on throughout this movie, and I am not usually one to appreciate that (I prefer movies that offer escapism) but in this case it was worth it to me. This movie is just so well-written and acted that I was willing to go through the experience. And in a way it is about anti-escapism, set as it is in Hawaii, with George Clooney's character bitterly noting in the opening voiceover that his friends on the mainland think his life must be heaven, living in paradise as he does, but don't they realize that people still suffer, and break each other's hearts, and die?<br /><br />For those who don't know, the plot of this movie (although 'plot' is not quite the right word) is that Clooney's character's wife is in a coma, and soon to be dead. He has to deal with this, and the reality of their troubled marriage which he will now never get to save, along with explaining it to his troubled daughters, ages 10 and 17, other family members, and friends. There is also a backstory involving valuable land his family owns, and is considering selling. I don't want to give everything away, but the essence is that this is a rich and quirky cast of characters, where no one is perfect and everyone is struggling to understand what is happening and how to connect, and forgive.<br /><br />The writing, the acting, the tone and the filming are all exactly right. It's a real film about real people, with no special effects, and grounded in the realities of life - both the harshest and most beautiful realities - and that makes it very special, and well-worth the praise it has received.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter saw the movie with her friends and then asked for the book for her birthday! I thought I'd read the sample book and that would be it! No I could not put it down. Would read it every chance I got..Then had to get the next two books!! I have finished all three and my daughter is still on the first one!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love to waste time playing this game. Most of the games are not hard at all. Great for all ages. also very fun
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Great carry case that protects my headset.  I liked it so much that when I lost the first one, I purchased the same one again!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its cool to have so many games on one app. I like the challenge that some of the games have.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was much more predictable than the first book. There were a few surprises, but it was nothing like the continual surprises and building excitement of book one. I still love the characters, still am dying to know who (if anyone) she gets together with and what will happen.<br /><br /> I have to say that for me, finding books to get lost in is tough. Little things usually annoy me like those \\"oh isn't this a bit too convenient\\" moments. But I let the rare few in this book slide because I like Katniss so much.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|well worth the wait its another must see horsey movie well executed with a fine unknown cast except for john malkovich of course who is superb as a goodie for a change
B004QOB8SO|1.0|Sherlock Season Two, 2011 film<br /><br />Writers with lesser talents shouldn't try to modify these classic stories about the beginnings of criminalistics. Part of the appeal of the original classic stories is their world that is just before modern technology. Horse-drawn transport and steam locomotives, a world lit by fire (candles and gas lamps), no telephone or electricity, etc. make these stories a travelogue into the past. Even fingerprints or ballistics are not in use! These stories seem to have been written by someone with an artificially enhanced imagination.<br /><br />\\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" begins by an immense swimming pool. There is a meeting between Sherlock and Moriarity; the latter walks away. [The opening scenes jump around.] Updating these classic stories takes away from the appeal of the originals. Sherlock uses the Internet to inspect a crime scene. [Besides looking silly, is that legally and scientifically sound?] We hear the name of Irene Adler and what she does for a living. Sherlock uses a ruse to get into her house. Irene is not surprised by this. Three armed men enter this room to rob the safe, but find what they don't want. There is action. [Is this confusing?] They communicate with cell phones. Sherlock recognizes a body from the neck down. Watson is lured away and gets a surprise! The story continues with intruders in Sherlock's rooms. They leave. The woman returns to hide in Sherlock's rooms. [Who wrote this confusing story?] Is this story designed to disgust the viewers? \\"Nicely played.\\" Sherlock figures out the combination to that cell phone so he can get its information. Irene no longer has her protection. But she will be safe. Or will she? \\"What shall we tell Sherlock?\\" A witness protection program? \\"Goodbye, Mr. Holmes.\\" Can there be another ending? Are they playing with their viewers? Or being deliberately stupid? Its like a comic cartoon.<br /><br />\\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\" begins with a young boy running at night. A nightmare? Sherlock Holmes is nervous and edgy, like from a physical ailment. Then he gets a case, a man's father was killed by a big black dog! A government experiment gone wrong? [No mention of private experiments!] Sherlock observes his client. [His \\"bedside manner\\" needs improvement.] They go to Dartmoor and learn about local beliefs and the hound. One man made a plaster cast of a dog's paw print. They tour a Top Secret government post. \\"Blue Bell\\"? [Is this padding?] They go out on the moor at night. [Unarmed?] They hear a strange noise. \\"A gigantic hound\\"? Sherlock notices a couple at the inn. Events continue. Will they make sense? Did a local businessman create a stunt with a big dog to attract tourists? Watson explores the laboratory by himself for scary events. Did he see what he expected to see? There are scenes that suggest hallucinations. A secret project? There is a call about Henry. Where is he? Can he remember what really happened twenty years ago? Sherlock explains the effects of fear and stimulus. Shots are fired! The old murder is solved! [Do you find any of this credible?] There are more explanations about the laboratory.<br />What a horrible pile of scrap! The original \\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" was a subtle criticism of a hereditary aristocracy that used a clever attempt at murder. Its background told of life in the late 19th century in a small rural village. What is the value of this movie? Can't the writers create their own drama instead of modifying a classic story to create a counterfeit? Do they need to stop smoking?<br /><br />\\"The Reichenbach Falls\\" begins with a meeting between Dr. Watson and his psychiatrist. Sherlock is dead! The story begins with the return of a kidnapped banker to his family. Sherlock welcomes publicity! Tourists visit the Tower of London. They are scanned by machines. There is a break-in where the Crown Jewels are kept. The police find an intruder on the throne. \\"Get Sherlock!\\" Sherlock meets a woman reporter in the men'sroom and diagnoses her condition. Sherlock corrects a lawyer as to the law. He diagnoses the jury! \\"Don't get clever\\" advises Watson. Moriarity chews gum. The jury says \\"not guilty\\". [A comedy?] Moriarity visits Sherlock to talk, uses a riddle to threaten him, then disappears. Mycroft warns about four assassins who moved next door to Sherlock. Sherlock investigates missing school children, one left a clue. Bread crumbs in an envelope? Sherlock locates the children. A man who helps Sherlock is shot dead!

B004TTZHBK|4.0|I love this app but it sure would be nice to be able to use all the videos.  Turning my kindle doesn't work just like other users. What is up with that?  Is there an update for this?  There should be soon if there isn't.
0345803507|1.0|This book was so boring, I found myself speed reading through it just to get finished with it.  I read so many positive reviews and couldn't wait to read it especially with book two being so good.  Ugh, this one was such a waste of time.  I didn't cry at the end as so many others did because I saw the end coming a mile away.  She eluded to it with every other chapter.  You knew it was going to happen.  Plus, the frequency of the sex scenes was ridiculous.  They had sex every time they went into another room.  They'd fight, they'd have sex.  She would get mad at him, they'd have sex.  When I'm mad at my husband, he'd better not touch me.  Also, the things she'd get mad at seemed so stupid.  I couldn't understand why she went so crazy, but I had to keep reminding myself she's 22 and immature.  This book doesn't get good until chapter 20, and there are only 25 chapters in it.  Even when it gets good, it's short lived.<br />I believe the popularity of these books is only because people want to know what the big deal is all about.
B0000B3B95|2.0|this movie sucks it is not good at all the incrediable hulk is way better the only thing i like about this movie is that the game for it is good but overall this movie sucks i would not recommend this.
0345803493|4.0|This book was way better than book one and three.  There is actually a story, romance, and some intriguing plots.  I didn't like the first one or the third one.  Basically, these books are horribly written using the same repetitive phrases way too frequently (flushed, impassively, biting her lip, etc.).  I almost didn't get the second book because of the first, but finally purchased it after some persuasion from a friend who was reading it.  It was much better.  I flipped past all the sex scenes which, luckily, weren't as frequent in this book as the others.  I wanted to just read the story.
B006R1T40I|5.0|This CD is excellent. I've been a Bonnie Raitt fan for over 20 yrs. It is well worth the 7 yr wait. Her voice sounds wonderful
B007X15GRQ|2.0|2 stars. The amazon crowd has got it right. This is clearly a hastily made money flick. I was surprised to read about great acting and \\"gritty\\" feel. There is no grit whatsoever in Contraband. In fact I abandoned the movie about 15 min before the end, exactly because there was no engagement or grit. There are few things which are working against calling this a good movie:<br /><br />1. Boring dialogs. I guess nobody read the script or what? 50% of all dialogs are different characters asking Wahlberg how he is going to pull off his smuggling. He always responds something like \\"have faith in me\\". The other 50% is Wahlberg invariably asking for more time when on the phone with his accomplices.<br /><br />2. No attention to details. This is the primary reason why this movie has zero grit. They are pulling their stunts in hot and humid Panama City. Yet nobody is even break a sweat.<br /><br />Overall, instead of spending money on relatively expensive aerial shots, producers would have been better off spending on better script and actually waking up Mark Wahlberg. Because Mark looks very stiff in this movie. This is a borderline flick which could have gone straight to DVD release bypassing big screen.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was being bombarded with so many people talking about this and being an avid reader, I thought I would give it a shot. I have never read any type of erotica novels and am not a prude, I just usually prefer Patricia Cornwell & James Patterson type of suspense novels or the easy summer reads. With that being said, I was instantly sucked in. You want to hate Christian Grey and tell Anastasia to run but also feel bad for him at the same time. You want to know why he is \\"fifty shades of f*@#ked up\\" and can't let go. The book hooks you and you will instantly want to start the 2nd installment of Fifty Shades. I would suggest this to any adult female reader!!
B001KTVVZS|5.0|I had seen an interview of Ishmael Beah on television and was struck by his testimony .  Some years later, I saw the book on the shelves and bought it immediately. It's the story of young Ishmael who flees rebels attacks in his village in Africa at the age of twelve.  He is picked up by the government army and made a boy soldier. He runs away from the army with a friend trying to go back home and during this long journey he witnesses unimaginable horrors. He finds his village but his family has perished in the hands of the rebels.<br />What makes this book a must  is that it's a real story and you come to understand the ununderstandable.  Those who know nothing about what happened in Africa and is still happening today will be shocked by the atrocities committed by these children of war who are picked up at a very tender age, and don't last long. Ishmael is saved from this world of horror and drugs at the age of sixteen by Unicef, which doesn't happen to the majority of war children who are condemned to die a violent death or of drugs.<br />A long way gone is a very powerful and well written book. It's also the honest account of what children are capable of doing in a world of violence, horror and drugs.  You need some courage to read it but you'll never forget it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had to start reading this immediately after finished the first book. (Definitely wouldn't make sense without reading the 1st.) Knowing the basics, you start to really delve into Christian's history and get a better feel for him and why he is the way he is. I finished this book in less than 2 days. I can't wait to read the 3rd now :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book! Can't wait to read the others in this series! I love being able to get books like this on my Kindle!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very. good game n its free can kill a lot of spare time playing excellent game<br />I would recoomend it
B005IF5H2S|4.0|I thought that the product was very good and I was able to find it and go through the check out process very quickly without any problems. They also emailed me my conformation very fast. I was very pleased.
B000FC10QG|5.0|Read this while I was doing my MBA Corporate Finance course. The course had a case study on the RJR Nabisco LBO/MBO, and reading this book added fantastic color and history to the case and class discussions. Besides the truly excellent penmanship of the authors, this story gives a superb glimpse into the the private equity industry and the entire ecosystem that makes it function. Finance students or enthusiasts - I would deem this a must read.
B004EN8KE2|5.0|This is the Second Book in the series of three.  Read the first \\"Hunger Games\\" was hooked.  This book is just as good.  Can't wait to listen to the third \\"Mocking Jay\\".  I recommned these books highly.
B0062P32V6|4.0|Rock'n'Rolf strikes again. The album is good but it looks like Rolf tried very hard to implement some of the old ideas into this album. You can hear the \\"Conquistadores\\" and \\"Port royal\\" era in the album beside \\"Pile of Skulls\\". But I do believe that he needs to reflect on \\"Death or Glory\\" album charracteristics before he could come up with an awesome album. I classiifed this album as a good album but still not one of its highest levels because I know ROLF can produce something better.
0545091020|5.0|Decided to listen to this book before watching the movie.  My husband and I drive 90 minutes a day and this really helps pass the time in traffic.  Purchased all three stories, finished two and and can't wait to get into the third.  Awsome stories and was read very well.  Hope this Author will continue writing these Stories.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is so much fun! its just like Mario bros except with a leprochaun . I highly recommend it! :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Those of you who just cannot get into the book, please I beg of you, continue reading. It does get better. The books are amazing and take you on a wild journey. Actually, if you take out the completely mind-blowing, S&M sex scenes and look at it from a realistic point of view, you may actually relate to some of it. Be honest, how many of us have been in a relationship and have had to bend a little for our partners? I'm not talking about sex, I'm talking about real life situations here. In the book, both characters \\"bend\\" for each other. Christian tries the relationship thing and Ana tries to the whole BDSM thing. It's a give and take, compromising essence of this book that drew me in, not just the steamy sex scenes.
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|I must admit that I am not in the intended target group for the book. That being said, I'm sure I am not the only 30+ mother who enjoys the occasional young-adult fiction novel.. On to the review:<br /><br />I found Crossed a bit boring. There were entertaining, \\"happening\\" bits in there, but for the most part not a lot was happening and I kept wondering \\"is this it?\\". Seemed like the book never reached any sort of high point or climax. The reader didn't get a lot of insight into neither Cassia's nor Ky's thoughts.<br /><br />I will read the third part of the trilogy, as the ending of Crossed left me curious, but this book overall felt like a filler.
1409116328|5.0|Set in 1986, Eleanor & Park is funny and sad, sarcastic and sincere, and above all geeky. The title characters are both 16-year-old misfits in their working-class Omaha neighborhood. Park is half-Korean in a mostly-white part of town, and is into alternative music and comic books, unlike his brother and dad who are into sports. Eleanor is big (she thinks of herself as fat) and awkward and poor, the oldest of five kids with a painfully difficult home life, and defiantly flaunts her crazy red hair and weird clothes.<br /><br />They find themselves sitting together on the school bus every day. Over time they're reluctantly drawn together by sharing Park's X-Men and Watchmen comic books. Despite their friends' derision and their families' dismay and disapproval, they fall in love over mix tapes featuring The Cure and the Smiths. A larger, more dangerous threat looms over one of them, skillfully woven throughout the story and coming to a climax in a way that will have you reading faster and faster to find out what happens.<br /><br />This story of first love---how it's almost always intense and heart-breakingly doomed, how you feel desperate and hopeless and wildly hopeful all at the same time---will take you right back to those thrilling stomachache-y days when you felt like you would suffocate under the weight of the love and lust you felt, and just holding your beloved's hand was enough to make you walk on air for weeks.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy using this app. It has easy to challenging games to choice from once you gather enough points to unlock new games. I hats the excessive ads that pop up. Overall I'm pleased. I haven't had any problems with the ad.
0307888908|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo6GOTWWZ2ANOE]]This book expands upon the ideas first described in Daniel Pink's 2002 [[ASIN:B002NSLN5I Free Agent Nation: The Future of Working for Yourself]]  This new book is informed by the great transitions that have occurred in the economy since Free Agent Nation was published.  These days people need less convincing that they need to be nimble or face stark economic prospects. This book includes some good tips that I hadn't thought about before. I hope this book is adopted in some high school classes because by the time students reach college, they may be too set in their ways to understand and adopt the always-learning, always-in-beta  lifestyle recommendations of this book.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I've never really read anything that pertained to Wiccans, and this was a perfect book to start with.  It explained the purpose of the rituals and all that goes into them.  That's great for a reader like me, that wouldn't have known otherwise.<br /><br />Sophia is a character that believes she can take care of herself.  She finds it hard to trust others and ask for help.  Most of this has to do with her relationship with her mother.  My only complaint is that we didn't see more of her father.  I would have liked to see her interact with him.  But, wow, her mother is something else.<br /><br />Charles is such an interesting character.  Half the time I didn't know if I wanted to slap him or kiss him. I did secretly love his arrogance. Nothing is sexier than confidence. Just sayin. I also love the fact that he is so protective of Sophie regardless of whether he thinks he should be.  He takes an interest in keeping her safe.<br /><br />There were a ton of twists that I never saw coming.  People I thought they weren't who they turned out to be.  It also explains why Sophie has such a hard time trusting others.<br /><br />Forever Girl is a book for those between YA and adult urban fantasy.  It's not raunchy or anything like that.  There's just a few cuss words, and creative writing when it came to overwhelming feelings. ;)<br /><br />This is such a unique look into the world of vampires, shifters, and witches.  It's not what I expected, and I'm extremely happy about that.  The book was creative and the perfect length.  I can't wait for the next installment.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Please add me bridgettb. I love how you can make it your own. I didn't think it would keep my interest, but it does. I have neighbors that are up in levels. I love the items that you can buy to decorate with.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its a fun little game with good graphics. only downside is the timed exhibits and slowness of acquiring some things. Payment system similar to Farmville, not necessary but game play is slow without.  not my favorite game, but again,  graphics are awesome.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|all good except friending which is not working... keeps closing. prompts me to restart.  not a good part of the program.  unreliable cant get hearts.............
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|Good movie. Whitney is a doll. She's adorable. Acting is great. Kevin is fantastic actor. The story is not super strong but good enough. Music is nice.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Am very satisfied with product and delivery by mail, all just as promised.  I give these as gifts, and my mother-in-law is impatiently awaiting here Season 2 of Downton Abbey, a birthday gift this summer!!  Thanks!
B0060D11OU|5.0|This is a fantastic movie and music for kids!  these classic tunes and funny dialog had my 7 year old laughing and singing all week.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good game bit it takes a while to unlock everything bit its worth it so try it out for yoirself
B0063GORYU|5.0|this app is great dnt listen to anyone else!it can b played from every angle on the kindle! u can either slide or tap the cards!
B001AQR3JY|1.0|The first time we watched the movie it worked fine.  We just got a our Blue Ray a few days ago and so we decided to watch the \\"Lion King\\" again.  It ran for a few minutes and all of a sudden it just stopped.  A message appeared \\"can't read disc\\".  My son said I can't return this because we already opened the package.  Very disappointing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't at all sure what this book would be about but I guess I'm now a fan of adult erotica. LOL
B002GHHHO2|5.0|Great movie the first time I saw it and when I finally bought it and was years since I've seen it. It was like watching it for the first time again. The case though is worn out a little bit, but as long as the cd isn't scratched I've gotten nothing else to say.
B003B02O14|1.0|Very slow moving and uninteresting, does not hold my attention. I have read only 40% and can not wait for it to end. I do not recommend it.Purchased through Amazon.com.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|I liked the movie it goes along with the story and they even brought back the original terminator \\"Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\" A lot of action and destruction so if your a guy like me which loves vilence then this a good movie to see if you haven't seen it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|thanking youversion for allowing me a quick way to view the Bible whenever! I like that if any reason I don't have time to read I can also listen.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I don't really work out and this DVD really kicked my butt. It is 20 minutes of intense strength, cardio and abs - but I'm telling you, will be thinking \\"I'm gonna faint, I'm gonna faint\\". She motivates through the whole thing, counting down, telling you to push through it. At the end of the 20 minutes you will be so glad it's over, feeling amazing that you did it, and super sore for the next two or so days.<br /><br />I'm not sure how one is supposed to do this workout for 30 days straight because of its intensity, so I'm doing 1 day of \\"Shred\\" and 1 day of \\"6 week 6-pack\\" for now.  Will work up to it I'm sure.<br /><br />Make sure you get some dumbbells and a mat - they are required for the workouts.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My son got me hooked on this story line.  So much so that once I started reading I couldn't stop.  I cannot wait to see what happens next!
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|I think this is the best steadicam available for under 200 bucks.<br />The merlin2 is clearly better, but costs more than 3 times as much.  If I had money to burn, I'd buy the merlin.<br />Maybe someday I will be able to buy a merlin, but until then, I can get great results with the opteka steadyvid pro!<br /><br />I created a video review on my youtube channel => panofish<br />I hope you find it useful!
B005VR91UW|5.0|I'll second everything that my fellow Amazon reviewer, Hyperbolium, said in his review. (I certainly can't add any more details to what's included in this package, except to point out that this is a SINGLE CD, which has the \\"Enhanced\\" video feature, meaning it will show the two \\"Girl Can't Help It\\" vids on your PC. It will not play in a DVD player on your TV.)<br /><br />But I want congratulate the producers of this reissue on doing such a great packaging job on a mid-priced CD reissue. The Specialty label is now owned by Concord Music Group (best known for it's jazz reissues) and they've given the Father of Rock and Roll a nice tribute with this package. I'm also hoping that folks who get this album, and are intrigued by the two video clips, will then check out the DVD of the film \\"The Girl Can't Help It!\\" and see the other great rock and roll stars that Director Frank Tashian (who directed Looney Tunes as well) added to the film. (And, hey, Jayne Mansfield is not too hard to look at either!)<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B007UXSPK2|2.0|Usually I don't bother watching Mission Impossible movies, since they're all terrible. However, this one got good reviews at a site I trust, so I gave it a go.<br /><br />Bad idea. The effects and the action and the gadgets are all great; it's when the actors stop shooting and start talking that you realize that every non-action bit of the movie is sub-par window dressing. The only bright spot in this movie is Simon Pegg, but he doesn't do enough to warrant spending any money at all to see it.<br /><br />One word: Netflix. And only if you're really, really bored.
B004US4K2C|5.0|I've tried several different Android Launchers since I adopted the platform a few years back, mostly because unlike iPhone and Windows Phones, Android allows virtually endless customizable home screens. Sure, you CAN customize the other brands, but compared to Android, nowhere to the degree I personally like.<br /><br />Before I tried Go Launcher, I was very partial to Launcher Pro, but I was won over by the larger number of options available with Go--or at least the kinds that appealed to ME specifically. From home transition effects (which are really clever, look great and in general are awesome) to specified apps and widgets designed just for Go Launcher--all of which I have found to be 100% free of charge (at least all that I've seen at this point), its getting more and more impressive--and easier to see why the customer is--in the end--the winner. As each app developer works hard to out-do all the others, more options arrive, with less or no cost whatsoever and consumers everywhere enjoy the benefits.<br /><br />Before checking out Go Launcher (or any other out there) I encourage you to check out YouTube videos demonstrating them to get a better idea of what would work for you personally. Seeing as most of them are scott free, you can download them and play to your hearts content and delete if you choose to--which is another way I personally believe Android trumps apple and Windows. Everyone is different, though, so keep that in mind. What works for one may not work for another. I don't mean to down-talk Windows or iPhones, because they both have great OS and personal preference is the only reason why I went with Android. For those that love iPhones, grab one and talk it up and don't let anyone tell you different and soforth. A lot of it is truly in the eyes of the user, and that just about does it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game works great and my 5 year old son is addicted! It plays similar to mario bros. which is his all time fav. Great graphics too.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is a fun diversion! running, jumping, gathering coins, throwing acorns and jumping on bad  guys. Don't forget to smash from below the shamrock blocks for possible extra lives!

B001E45XT4|2.0|It's a pretty good pair of headphones with a very, very short lifespan. I bought these because I saw they were at a decent price and had good reviews. However, mine began to malfunction in less than a month, with adjusting the volume of the headphones causing scratching noises, and eventually adjusting them can make one of the speakers stop working unless you fiddle with it. If you buy it, be prepared to replace it in less than a month's time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is an awesome game. I think that gameloft is awesome and based on ice age,that makes it more awesome. keep making more games like this one please!!!!
B007G5GYHA|4.0|The family really enjoyed this HD download.  The video quality was excellent and the movie is a cute addition to the \\"Shrek\\" franchise.  Only complaint is that the download for instant viewing took longer than we had expected compared to other downloads we have recently viewed.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I just don't understant why can't use Kindle reader in my country. I'm an Australian. Before I always buy books from Amazon they ship to me. Now I specially bought a Sumsung Tablet for reading books. But very sad to know the Sumsung Tablet can't download Kindle reading because I'm not in America. I just don't understand what the reason. Does that means Racial Discrimination?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is one of the best books, that I have purchased. It is non-stop reading. You will have to buy the next book before you are finished with the first book. I could not stop thinking about the characters after I finshed the trilogy.
B005SFR7YE|3.0|I missed this when it aired in the theaters and it aired on PBS right after I had purchased it and it was on its way to me.  I wish I had seen it on PBS as I would not have bothered ordering it.  In a few words, I don't really care for it.  I won't elaborate but suffice to say I much prefer the movie version with Gerard Butler.  I've seen the live musical 5 times and each of those times were much better than this version.  Didn't like the performers nor the sets.  The orchestra was the only redeeming facet.  I'll keep it I guess for the heck of it but can't imagine ever watching it again.
0345803485|2.0|I awarded this novel two stars because the quality of the writing is severely lacking.<br /><br />The love scenes, however . . . as the narrator would murmur, Holy Crap.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|I'm not sure why ppl keep saying its not free. After trial it STILL works. This app plays any format video you can throw at it.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|i got in trouble at school b.c i could not put it down. this book is the reason i started writing!
0345803485|1.0|Hated this book! I would never recommend anyone read this trash! I am ashamed to say that I bought this book. It is nothing but porn and unrealistic at that. I don't think housewives daydream about being whipped or tied up! Very disappointed.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Read this strictly for entertainment. Its not the sharpest written piece of literature you'll see.... but its a GREAT story. I found it very hard to put down. Very imaginative for sure and ok for older kids to read (it really is considered a kids book but probably a preteen book is more correct.)
B0071T5PN0|1.0|I couldn't even get past listening to the samples. I listened to the samples and not one song sound like something I wanted to listen to all of the way through, now this either means that the samples are not the best parts of the songs, which would be stupid or this album is not worth having. I'm not writing this review to guide other would be purchasers, but to just explain why I will not be purchasing this album. I'm hoping others will back up my opinion.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and relaxing. very nice graphics.  all in all, a great game.  I have not purchased acorns and don't need to.
B003K16P3M|2.0|it was a good story, however it it lacksfocus and is poorly written. i think tha a book like this should start strongerand should end stronger. i am a publisher so this story did not get my attetion wha so ever i advise you not to read this  my real name isnt that above fyi
0345803485|1.0|I've never written a review but am making an exception in this case in order to boost the negative ratings. 50 Shades of Grey is quadruple crap. Unbelievable premise. Cardboard characters. Ridiculous plot. Boring dialogue. Truly bad sex scenes.  And much more! All written in a puerile style.  Truly abysmal in every way.  Stick with Jane Austen and/or de Sade.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A very well written trilogy, a must-read before watching the movie.<br />I read it on the Kindle app on my iPad 3, and font-size sometimes changed erratically as well as pages jumping forward or backwards by 2 pages.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I highly recommend it!! I finished it five times now and it still is AWESOME!!! get it NOW!!! it only has nine levels... I am sad.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I work at a middle school and was wondering what all the hype was about, so when my curiosity got the better of me, I caved!!! Once I started reading the books I couldn't put them down!!! Fortunately, I previewed the first book and bought the trilogy. I found all three books imaginative, and engaging and I couldn't stop reading! When I finished the set, I was disappointed because I was done. The characters were well developed and for a teen book the plot was intense. I can't wait for another set of books like these to come along. I didn't want to spoil it by going to the movie!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game. some games are more challenging than others but once you get the hang of a game its easy to get points. liking forward to completion.
1565234243|5.0|This is an excellent little book.  Hopefully I can now become a Michaelangelo in carving.<br />This book gives an entrance guide to achieving realistic works of art.  If used properly<br />this can make a person's efforts in carving worthy of entering art collections.

0374275637|5.0|I am still reading the book, but the first 100 pages I read it in 24 hours and I consider it fascinating, easy to read, and even thoough is scientific oriented, the book is light to read, examples are clear, you do not have be a psychologist to be interested in this type of information.<br />This book is very interesting about how the mind works and processes information, it has a lot of concepts and theories based on several studies by psychologists and other key experts in the area that support how people make decisions, why people is attracted to certain things \\"uncounciously\\", when people use the \\"intuition\\" versus de councious analytical mind to process certain type of information, etc.<br /><br />If you are ne of those persons who are fascinated about how human being operate and how the mind works, this book is for you!
B007BT0RKG|1.0|I downloaded this App and deleted it within the first 5 mins.  It doesnt allow you to put addresses, it just lets you scroll.  Not worth it, even though it is free.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|THE FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS..<br /><br />I was beyond intrigued with the synopsis and downloaded the sample, by the 2nd chapter I wanted more! The author did a great job creating two strong characters (Travis and Abby) that compliment one another (in their own twisted and crazy way). This story line is not your average boy-meets-girl love story, what compelled me the most was the 'raw' component of falling in love and each other's companionship. Yes, there is unnecessary violence and others may have viewed Travis as a psychopath/stalker, but who doesn't like to read about the troubled-badboy-with-persistent-charms that'll-do-anything-for-that-one-girl-despite-all-the-odds?? With characteristics like Travis and Abby their obstacles were inevitable. There were rises of different plots and events that shook the story a bit, so it wasn't always about drama, breakup-and-makeups. There was a bit of action and comical scenes. Overall, the book made me cry, made me smile and giggle, made me want to slap Travis sometimes, then made me want to hug him afterwards.. After finishing the book, I felt empty as I always do from reading a great book. So the next day I read it again and I felt every emotion just the same.<br />I recommended this book right away to my sisters and friends. Definitely worth it!
0307352145|5.0|i originally heard about susan cain from a talk on TED. i thought it was a wonderful talk and something america needed to hear. but when i found that she had written a book on the topic, i thought the book probably wouldn't be an important read since it'll probably just be an elaboration on why introverts are important in society and why we need to make adjustments in school and work for introverts. the reason why i picked up the book (actually got the audiobook) was because a co worker had recommended it to our ceo. me in all my quirkiness, i believe that when someone recommends a book it's most likely a really good book; so i bought it.<br /><br />she goes through a lot of research, giving the possible biological reasons for introversion and extroversion. she's extremely thorough in her research and very even headed about it's presentation. one thought that lingered as i read the book was that she might try to swing the pendulum too far the other way, demonizing extroversion, but she didn't. she saw and understood the benefits both types of personalities brought to society and the need for balance between the two.<br /><br />i could write for pages about the qualities of the book, but it's just something you have to read for yourself. especially if you're the type of person who wants to understand the nuances of people. be it yourself, or others.

0061733199|5.0|Purchased the book several years ago and wanted to have a second copy for the car.  A lot of the info in this book can probably be found on the internet, but it's nice to have it in a small and nicely organized book.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I am so glad that I purchased my Kindle Fire from Amazon and now am building up my library collection with their help. \\"The Lucky One\\" Nicholas Sparks again wrote a tender and touching book.  This one was so beautifully written so that each person was seen by you and each personality was open so you understood why and how that person thought and felt.  Sparks paints such a colorful story that no one has problems following the story line.  I will go see the movie but I know it will not stand up to the book.....enjoy everyone for the read is remarkable![[ASIN:1455508977 The Lucky One]]

B00127RAJY|5.0|These workouts are perfect for someone like myself who has limited time and lack of space. I do this DVD right in my bedroom. Most of the moves only require about four feet of space.

B004TSXUWY|5.0|Wow ... what a story. Once of the few that I have read cover to cover in a day and late into the night. Whilst I had seen many people praise this book, I hadn't actually read anyone's review of it so had no idea what to expect so when i friend at work lent it to me at work and said \\"you've got to read it\\" I took it. I'm so glad I did. Brilliantly put together, creepy, thought-provoking and totally unexpected.<br /><br />I wondered at the start how someone who only remembers things whilst awake and then the memory put back to zero when she woke the next day could be explained but SJ Watson does so in such a clever and believable way... obviously I won't be giving anything away.<br /><br />What I will say about this book is that it's not a light easy to read sunday afternoon type book .. this is the sort of book that will grab you and not let go until the final chapter. It has more twists and turns than a corkscrew ride at Alton Towers but in such a way you just don't see them coming - guess you are on the ride backwards!!<br /><br />If like me you try to shy away from the books that have the huge \\"hype\\" may I suggest you give this a try - You won't regret it I promise! One word of warning - my suggestion is not to read it late at night on your own just before you try to go to sleep!!!<br /><br />Fantastic work and certainly an Author I would look out for again. If you loved Sister by Rosamund Lupton, you'll love this too.
0345803485|4.0|It seems like everyone knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who whispered in their ear about a delectably kinky new novel called \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\".  Of course, none of these friends could answer any of my plaguing questions about this work by E.L. James, so I was forced to do some \\"personal research\\" - and I am quite glad that I was.  The questions that you want answered - I've got the goods.  Is \\"Fifty Shades\\" the jaw-dropping, outlandishly kinky romp that it is proported to be?  Not really.  Unless you're a soccer mom living in the Bible Belt, I'm going to assume that you've probably heard most of this stuff before.  (The safe word is \\"red\\", okay?)  There are no whips, no actual chains, and no one does anything with any goats, so you can relax now.  Should you let your fifteen year-old daughter delve into the world of E.L. James?  Probably not, but she's going to anyway.  Deal with it!  Is this a well-written piece of literature worthy of becoming a 'Modern Classic'?  Absolutely not!  James' writing is elementary, at best, and her editor should probably be shot. While James greatly lacks, what she does provide is a deliciously quick read that will light the fire in your loins and leave you begging for more (bad but so good) sex.  In short, toss this little temptation into your beach bag and you won't be sorry, but delve into it with few expectations.  This is not the poetic, intelligently emotive prose of Toni Morrison or the elaborate, fantastical stylings of George R.R. Martin: it's just sex, people.  Enjoy it!
B004NJC0B6|5.0|I've traditionally not been a big fan of concert films.  \\"Let There Be Rock\\" is the exception to the rule. Simply put,  this is a masterpiece.  It's Bon's masterpiece.<br /><br />The film has interview and back stage segments in between the songs, but unlike many concert films, you enjoy these parts. As a matter of fact, when Bon is being interviewed, you don't want it to end. He was just such a down to earth and likeable guy, and it shines through in the interviews included here. There's a segment where Phil Rudd is driving a Porsche on a frozen field on a cold gray day, while Cliff Williams is buzzing above in a biplane. The plane lands, and Cliff gets out wearing the coolest jacket and shoes you've ever seen, and gets into the Porsche, and speeds off with wheels spinning. The scene then cuts to Bon dancing on a frozen river.  He then walks over and sits on the hood of Phil's Porsche,  all to the tune of \\"Walk All Over You.\\"<br /><br />The picture quality is top notch for a film that was made over thirty years ago. This day and age, it's become vogue to \\"update\\" older productions. Thankfully, this isn't the case here, and the whole film is the original, including graphics. I have the bare bones version of the DVD, not the special edition. I prefer the basic DVD because it's just the film, not any filler. The basic version does allow you to skip to the songs you like, but you'll want to watch the whole thing from start to finish most times.<br /><br />Of course the band is perfect in the concert,  and the song choice is great.  The camera work is good, and doesn't suffer from the dizzying editing that has been so popular in the last 15 years. I do have to complain that the concert part of the film is a bit Angus focused. The camera is on him a little too much. But, we do get to see the other guys too, including Phil playing while his drum kit is being repaired by a roadie. There's a wild scene where Angus rides out into the crowd on the shoulders of a road crew guy. This is standard AC/DC stuff, but watch the poor roadie's face as he gets pummeled in the audience! This is an AC/DC concert, complete with the Angus \\"strip show\\" routine, and pretty much what you'd see in one of their shows today, but it's different because it's a more intimate setting than the huge performances they do now.<br /><br />If I had one gripe, it'd be with the DVD package. It's horrible. It's a generic design not fitting for the best concert film of all time. You'd think that since this is Bon Scott's grand finale, he'd be featured prominently on the cover. Sadly that's not the case.<br /><br />If you're an AC/DC fan, or you just appreciate good rock music, I would highly recommend \\"Let There Be Rock.\\"
0553801473|4.0|Like a great game of cyvasse, George R.R. Martin is yet again arranging his key players for another epic showdown in Westeros...and beyond. Sellswords, plague, dragons, OH MY! In \\"A Dance With Dragons\\", the key elements are set forth for the tensions that will be necessary to bring about further wars across the Seven Kingdoms and beyond. Martin's writing always flows beautifully, though this time around the plot is a bit slower than previous editions (think more the speed of its predecessor, \\"A Feast For Crows\\"). But that's okay: we've come to know that when it comes to George R.R. Martin, the very best explosions of chaos come to those who wait!

B001HNE3NO|1.0|The main character was unbelievably flaky, I found it hard to believe that a normal person would actually act like that. She claimed she loved Paris, her husband and her inlaws, but ultimately, she had nothing nice  to say about them.  She felt like a complete outsider, and was uncomfortable with her surroundings in every way. And then theres the whole \\"sarah\\" thing. We know who Sarah was and what happened, but she was completely infatuated with just a name. She knew absolutely nothing about this girl and had no logical reason to figure out what happened to her, other than selfish emotional ones. She gambled with her future just to meet the son of some girl she new almost nothing about. Do women really act like that? And then, she gives up her husband, that she didn't seem to like anyways, for a child that I didn't even know she really wanted... I don't know. I normally don't have negative things to say about books, I love them all. But this one made me sorry for women everywhere. If I ever become that flaky, I'd want someone to tell me I was acting stupid.

B0054JELS4|1.0|After receiving this product and went to watch them they are made about as cheap as they can be made. I have only tried to view season one. The disc first comes on with subtitle in Chinese. After I got the subtitle turned off. Started watching the show the screen becomes pixilated, can't understand what the people are saying. The disc skips,stalls and moves on the the next show. I have changed out my DVD player to one just out of the box and it does the same thing. one of the discs has the wrong titles on the disc cover. All the discs in season 1 did the same thing so I tried the first disc in season 2 and it does the same thing. If I knew before I ordered these I would not of bought them. These were not worth the price I paid in fact they are not worth having even if someone gave them to you.

B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|Steven Soderbergh doesn't always make critically acclaimed movies; yet, he remains a critical darling.  I think it's because he takes chances with his films.  He's willing to try his hand at new genres and to push at the boundaries of those genres.<br /><br />Haywire, at its core, is a straightforward revenge-driven action thriller.  Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) did a job in Barcelona.  Shortly after, she finds herself betrayed by her agency and pursued by assassins.  But the movie begins after that, with Mallory's first contact post-betrayal with former coworker Aaron (Channing Tatum).  The Barcelona and Dublin jobs fold out in flashbacks.<br /><br />There are moments when Haywire shines.  The script is lean, allowing the images to carry the story.  Most of the action unfolds wordlessly to a jazzy electronic score by David Holmes.  At Haywire's release, critics made a big to do over a female action star who looked like she could actually carry out the action.  Now, Carano did her time as an MMA fighter.  She's got muscle, and it shows, especially in the rare scene where her bare arms make an appearance.  But she's not particularly Amazonian.  Her muscle is more toned than bulky.  But Carano carries the physicality of the movie wonderfully.  She can do her own stunts and the choreography is quite wonderful.<br /><br />Carano's acting is not up to par with her stuntwork.  She does good at playing cold, which is necessary for most of the film, but she's less convincing when having a touching moment with her father.  The role of Mallory suits Carano well, and she might certainly have a future as an action star.  Most of the acting is carried off by the very able supporting cast, which includes Michael Fassbender and Michael Douglas.  I adore Ewan McGregor, but his Kenneth didn't always work for me.  (It may be because I associate blond Ewan McGregor with [[ASIN:B002ZG9800 I Love You Phillip Morris]] and thus think blond Ewan McGregor is the sweetest thing ever.)<br /><br />As much as I loved the flashbacks, the framing was somewhat awkward.  Mallory explains her story to a preternaturally calm kid.  I'm not blaming the actor.  It was a strange part, and it's for the best that the end of Haywire forgets that he ever existed.<br /><br />If you like action movies or any of the actors involved, I'd buy or rent Haywire.  It delivers heavily on stylish, brutal, and realistic action.  The story isn't ridiculously stupid and the long interlude with Mallory and Paul (Fassbender) is delightfully tense.  But don't go in expecting more than a fun movie.  Being slightly more clever than the average thriller does not a masterpiece make./>As much as I loved the flashbacks, the framing was somewhat awkward.

1589946634|5.0|This is a pretty good game. Randomization keeps things interesting and sometimes makes the game harder. The strategy is to shoot the enemy while moving through the ship. Utilizing the various terrain can help a lot. I bought a few expansion packs for this game and they make it even more fun.<br /><br />Overall, it is a decent game to play. Wear and tear on the cards can get old, though. Luckily, most of the cards sit on the table as you play. Only a few cards are in your 'hand'.<br /><br />This is a challenging yet fun game to play.

0345803485|5.0|Oh.My.God. I don't care what anyone else has said about this book. I loved it. I will admit that I had a bit of trouble with the first couple of chapters of Ana's dialogue and it dragging on, but pushing past that and really getting into the story.....oh. My. God. Break out the fans, the ice water, the pool....anything to cool off! E L James has created one fascinating start to a fantastic series filled with so much more than erotic scenes and kinky romance. She's filled it with amazingly complex characters, humor and deep meaning.<br /><br />Right now, I'm trying to decide whose character spoke to me the most and became my favorite. I loved both Anastasia and Christian in ways that were different. I loved Ana with her witty self. Her inner goddess and her subconscious often spoke to her and left a smile on my face. I found myself smiling and cheering Ana on as she deals with her feelings and inner turmoil about choosing whether or not to become Christian Submissive.<br /><br />And Christian.....wow. I absolutely adored his character. Not because he was a Dom, but because he had so much inner turmoil, and secrets from his past, that I wanted to reach out and play the ever caring mama role and hug his past away. Don't get me wrong, though. He's controlling side is out of this world wowza! I loved it. But, you can really see the inner struggle he goes through, especially after meeting Anastasia in the meeting. That being said, I did hate Christian and his bossiness and stuffiness at first.<br /><br />Together, these two characters flow perfectly to bring out a complex, meaningful story of facing fears, learning to trust and relinquishing control. It really pulls the reader to the center of the story and keeps them planted until the very last page. With a mix of humor with some really laughable emails between the characters, your never left for wanting with this novel.<br /><br />I can definitely say that this is my favorite book of 2012 by far. I didn't think that I would like it after reading and hearing about the issues people had with it, but it's more than the BDSM and control....it's about finding your true self, about facing fears, and learning to let go. I definitely recommend this with 5 Books and I've already got book 2 sitting on my Kindle and am looking forward to finding the chance to read it as well. This a series that is sure to stay on my reader and I'll go back again and again. A bit of warning though.......make sure you have lots of uninterrupted reading time to devour this book.
0345803493|3.0|(be sure to read my review of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" as this is essentially an extension of that review)<br /><br />In this novel, Christian is dealing with adjusting his life to avoid losing Ana and she is attempting to meet him in the middle. He's struggling to get over his demons and she's simply struggling to regain some of her footing in reality and get back some of her independence. The sex scenes are still pretty hot & steamy, but they're lacking the intensity of the original book.<br /><br />It was decent but didn't quite compare to the first. But it's still a good read, just the same.
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|This is 4th entry into the Underworld franchise, and certainly the sequel we were waiting for more than Rise of the Lycans.  Not that Rise was a bad movie, it was a prequel when I wanted a sequel.  Nevertheless, this movie has all the hallmarks of the franchise, and then some.  Plus, it sets it up nicely for the next movie should there be one.  If you enjoyed Underworld 1 and 2, you will certainly enjoy this entry in the series.<br /><br />A side note: The digital copy you get will be only accessible through the Ultraviolet platform.  In my opinion, the far inferior method of delivering digital copies.  Too many steps to get to your digital copy, plus you don't actually get a digital copy of your product (as in the file), you just get access to it in Ultraviolet's cloud.  At least with iTunes, if Apple goes kaput tomorrow, I still have my digital copy that will run on any number of platforms (Media player, DivX, etc.) whereas Ultraviolet and Flixster have encoded the copies so they can only be played by their programs.  Lame to the 9s!  I was tempted to give the product a lower rating b/c of this, but this ridiculousness regarding the digital copy is not the movies fault, but the distributor's.  BAD move Sony, bad move...
0345803485|4.0|After reading all of the crap reviews, I was pleasantly surprised by the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy.<br /><br />What may have started out as fan fiction of Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" saga has taken a very edgy and adult turn. While there were many similarities (the innocent but intelligent heroine, the overbearing and self-loathing hero, tragic pasts, unusual familial situations, etc.), there was enough different about it that I was able to continue reading to see what happened next.<br /><br />In answer to some of the biggest critiques of this series:<br />(1) It's a \\"Twilight\\" knockoff: yes and no. Stephenie Meyer created a series that stirred up a lot of emotions (and imaginations) of people all over the world. And while hers was very chaste and innocent, Ms. James took it to the next level and then some. How often is there a legitimate \\"original\\" idea? I haven't encountered one. And who hasn't been so stirred by a novel or a piece of music or a movie that you find yourself daydreaming about your own version? As I said above, there are enough differences between the novels that you can distinguish two separate stories.<br /><br />(2) Annoyance over Ana's references to her subconscious and inner goddess: while there were many mentionings of them (sometimes too many, especially in the first book), we're dealing with the classic reference of the angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other. Ana is in a situation that is both enthralling and scary. And she's trying to balance between what she's always known and how her feelings towards Christian are changing that. It's essentially just personifying the internal conversations everyone has.<br /><br />(3) The PG descriptions & references in the sex scenes: if you want hardcore erotica, go buy some. This story is told from the perspective of a virgin with minimal experience who is basically thrown into the BDSM scene. She's anxious, excited, & nervous. I think it would have been less believable if she were talking like a porn star. Perhaps my viewpoint is a bit skewed, but we're taking a willful but innocent woman and throwing her into the sexual gladiatorial ring with a seasoned expert.<br /><br />Now that I've said that, this was probably my favorite book of the series. The story was sexy, believable, and intriguing. While I loved the \\"Twilight\\" series, the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy is different enough to be a stand-alone series in its own right.e a porn star.

0345803507|2.0|(be sure to read my review of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and \\"Fifty Shades Darker,\\" as this is essentially an extension of those reviews)<br /><br />Out of the three novels, \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" is the least believable and the ending was anti-climatic. The fact that Ana was given the editorial position (after working there a month or so and being 22...despite the fact that Christian purchased the company!) was simply too unbelievable for me to get my mind around. While I understand giving her something that re-establishes her independence, this was unheard of and unrealistic.<br /><br />The steamy scenes from the first two novels were pretty much repeated in this one...I was bored and was hoping for something new/exciting. But nada.<br /><br />***spoilers below***<br /><br />The \\"battle scene/big reveal\\" = ARGGGHHHHH!!!! The suspense build and ended with 50-ish pages left in the novel. And the unnamed financial \\"benefactor\\" of the villian behind all of the accidents turned out to be such a minor character, he/she was referenced so minimally in the previous novels it just seemed stupid.<br /><br />And finally...the end of the book/series made me roll my eyes. While I love happily ever after's, this book started out on emotional scars and BDSM. It ended with a happy, normal family with one more on the way, with some tied up sex hidden away from the kids. Ugh. The end was sucky. I felt like the readers were the ones who had been tied up and left hanging at the end of the book. Perhaps I'm jaded.<br /><br />Overall: decent series, glad I read it.

0439023491|2.0|I liked hunger games (first book) even though it had some flaws but this book is not as good and is poor enough that I've decided to skip the third book. I rarely stop reading a series once I get to the second book so you get some idea of how poor this book was for me. I won't give away spoilers but just need to note that Katniss is such a fool throughout this book that I started to wish they'd kill her off even though I knew that would never happen. The reader figures out what is going on at least 200 pages before Katniss which makes most of this book annoying. The support characters are better but first person narration limits exploration of these characters. That is a shame since some of them seemed to have stories and personalities at least as interesting as Katniss and perhaps more interesting that her story.
0345529057|5.0|One of my favorite fantasy series, great book. Martin is a great author and i would recommend these books to just about anyone, especially if they like fantasy at all. I just hope he finishes the series before he dies
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This movie is a classic.The set contains great information about the making of the movie. One of the most interesting parts is how the movie related to our entrance into WWII.  Gary Cooper as always is great.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Just dreadful. After all the hype, I finally purchased this book and I want my 2 days back. It's a porn with no subject, completely boring, and no meaning whatsoever. Save your money.
0393088774|5.0|Everyone should read this book. It is written in a comprehensible language. It is the voice of reason. We can no longer afford the neoliberal policies (the dogmatic religion of privatization and deregulation) that have created this financial crisis.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|My two stars are strictly for Streep's wonderful performance; the movie itself is a confused, annoying mishmash that sheds little actual light on Thatcher's long political career. Instead, we are treated to the \\"memories\\" of a pathetic old woman, with dementia, who once was a significant historical figure.<br />I will admit up front that I am a long tome admirer of Lady Thatcher; if that colors my review, so be it, but I am trying to be objective.<br />This awful travesty  of filmaking seems to revel in it's emphasis on Thatcher as she sadly is today, rather than exploring her difficult rise to the top of the Conservative Party , being not just a woman, but the daughter of a grocer! Quelle horreur! Her triumphs seem to be portrayed grudgingly, but her failures almost celebrated.<br />Obviously, Lady Thatcher was, and remains a divisive figure, both in the UK and elsewhere; most historic, transformative figures are as well. Yet this film fails to answer both the how, and the why of it's subject.<br />Thankfully, this was a Red Box rental, and not a purchase, so only $1.28 wasted ( plus tax).
0345803485|2.0|I read these books cause of the high reviews! But all she does is complain about him and then talk about how hot he is!! We get it hes hot and your a jealous bitcher.. I read the first book and it was ok. I had to force my way thur the second and I got the third cause and i thought well maybe it will get better the rating say soo..This man who is suppose to be so rich and sooo smart marries a women he knows less then 3 months and knows nothing about not even if she wants to keep her last name after marriage.\\"really\\" But if i have to hear anymore about her inner goddess or how he is like a teenager anymore I might throw my kindle out the window. These books are not worth the $10 that they are on the kindle and I would not recommend them to a friend. This is my first review and Im only doing this one so I can try to stop someone else from wasting $30 and about a week of your life you cant get back!
B005QUQRE2|4.0|Another Earth was a thoughtful and reflective movie on how to a person can compensate for causing pain to another human being. I felt that the movie showed in a sensitive way how rendering service to the one harmed can help heal the wounds caused to them. I felt the movie was very open, honest, uplifting and positive.
B004EPYZV2|1.0|I really liked the movie, but the Ultraviolet Copy is TERRIBLE!  Instead of it being a simple download to my computer, it's a complicated sign-up after sign-up to make new accounts for paramount.com and also with Ultraviolet.  Then after all of that, I still can't download it to iTunes.  In order to watch the movie I have to be connected to the internet and use the Paramount Application.  Totally inconvenient.  If you are an iTunes user, just download it from there.<br /><br />Now if there is a way to download it straight to iTunes, will someone please let me know?  Thank you!

B0073J9SGS|2.0|Not sure where Rufus was going with this one. His other albums are much better. This one just seems a little cheesy to me both musically and lyrically. What happened to the feeling and passion from earlier albums. my advise to Rufus would be -- on your next ablum -- Be yourself. Take me back in time, on a trip to Venice, India, 16th century England, Barcelona...<br /><br />Each one of Rufus albums take you on an adventure -- this one stays in the same place. I'm left waiting now for the next album.

0345803485|3.0|I purchased the book after hearing that several book clubs in my town were reading it together. At first, I kept asking \\"why in the world are they reading this crap?\\" but I found myself wondering if Ana would accept the terms or if Christian would change his ways. I got sucked in and HAD to purchase Fifty Shades Darker which I am currently reading.<br />The intimate scenes between Christian and Ana didn't bother me as much as they bothered other readers. But remove the sex scenes and the constant discussion about the contract between the main characters, there isn't much of a story. Basically - a rich good looking man falls in love with a recent college graduate. They both have different ideas of what they want in a relationship. 500 pages later, they are no longer together.<br />I would recommend the book to someone who need a book to read at the beach. It's a quick read and I would categorize it as realistic fiction.

B002AF4Y96|4.0|First off the film itself is amazing on so many different levels, so I wont go into that right now.  It's a classic.  Watch it.  There.  OK.  Now...about the blu ray transfer & the \\"shaking\\" stated from other reviews.  I DID notice the bottom half of the picture moving up & down through the opening credits...but then it stopped.  I'm not sure but I vaguely remember another copy (old VHS tape) that I had doing the same thing.  I also vaguely remember Stone saying that he put that in there intentionally to draw the audience in with a feeling of unease or unbalance, right away.  But...yeah...like I said, the picture only did that for the first few minutes of the film.  Other than that...the transfer itself is average at best.  I had to mess around with the settings on my tv (turned the color temp to \\"cool\\", and upped the sharpness level).  After I did that it had a pretty clear & focused picture.  The sound was good.  Crystal.  No distortion.  Special features are kinda lame.  Only new to blu ray feature being a short documentary on how the film would be if it were released now.  Kinda interesting, worth watching once I guess.  Then you have all the deleted & alternate scenes from the other versions.  Director commentary (also from the other versions), Charlie Rose interview and the chaos rising doc (also from the other versions).  There is also a fat booklet with some cool facts & pictures in the blu ray case.  Not a bad purchase, but they could have done so much more with this given the format.
0451205766|5.0|Mario Puzo's novel, the Godfather, is truly a great novel. It is an exceptional portrait into the lives and minds of its characters and it is an excellent study of Italian-Americans in both the legitimate and \\"illegitimate\\" world in the 1940s and 1950s.<br /><br />As several reviewers have noted, the Godfather traps the reader from the begining. It has a very interesting and one that you probably already know from the movies ([[ASIN:B000NTPDSW The Godfather Collection (The Coppola Restoration) [Blu-ray]]]). More than that, it takes inside to understand what motivates the characters and how they respond to the world around them. Strange as it may sound, reading the book helped me to understand on an emotional level a lot of the current thinking about social capital, which was pioneered by Putnam's [[ASIN:0691037388 Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy]]. Much of the story deals with Michael Corleone's attempt to merge his American values with his responsabilities to his family and his father's values. His father, Don Vito Corlone (the Godfather), also had to make a similar transition when he entered into the \\"olive oil\\" business as the novel outlines.<br /><br />The novel is obviously the source material for the movie triology and since Mario Puzo was the author of the screenplay as well as the novel, the movie and book are quite consistent. While there are some minor differences between the book and the movie (for example, Lucy Macini does not have a son and Michael Corleone has two sons), these are not important. More importantly, the book explains what is going instead the characters' head and fills in a lot of the backstory. Do you want know why Al Neri wore a police uniform when he gunned down Barzini? The book explains....<br /><br />The only negative comment I have to say about the book is that it is too long....not too many pages, but just too much material. The whole (largely absent in the movie) story about Johnny Fontaine, Lucy Mancini,and their friend Nino seemed a bit too long. But I guess it added to study of Italian-Americans' minds in the \\"legitimate world.\\" Highly recommended.
B0073PZIYI|5.0|I'm not sure why this movie doesn't have better reviews because it was a great show.  There is a life lesson this film is trying to portray, and they do it in a very exciting way.  Timberlake did great in this movie which suprised me because the last show I saw him in was terrible.  Very recommended if you like sci-fi and altered control society shows.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|I have enjoyed Mission Impossible since it was a TV series many years ago and the movies with Tom Cruise have been action thrillers.  The most recent movie Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol has added more comedy and I must say I enjoyed it even more. Simon Pegg was a good choice to add to the MI team.  He can be serious or add comedy to lighten up the mood. My wife, that hasn't cared to review the previous versions, actually said she wouldn't mind seeing this one again.  As always should you accept to watch this movie you should expect lots of action and plenty of stunts.  Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton know how to act and pull off some great scenes. All the cast played their parts very well but Cruise and Pegg will definitely make you want to see it more than once.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: The story centers around a nuclear terrorist that wants to have a controlled nuclear war to weed out the less fit so that we may improve the natural selection.  In other words another insane arms dealer at least a couple bricks short of a load.  It's too bad they kill off Josh Holloway (Lost) as I think he would have made a good asset to the MI team.  Or is he really dead or just badly injured?  Anythings possible in the movies even if you get six bullets to the chest from a female assassin.  Is Tom's MI wife really dead?  You'll have to see it to the end to know for sure.  Only a few things are certain besides death and taxes when it comes to Mission Impossible. You'll see incredible choreographed stunts, excellent impersonations, hear the Mission Impossible theme, and see a lit fuse before the credits.  If you enjoyed this, be sure to catch [[ASIN:B00274SIUG Echelon Conspiracy]].<br /><br />CA Luster
0345803485|3.0|I admit that I am a \\"book snob.\\" I love Austen, Bronte, Fitzgerald, and Rossetti. However, I sometimes get a craving for \\"junk.\\" For example, Persuasion is a Filet Mignon with all the trimmings while Twilight is a snickers bar. Wuthering Heights is Roasted Red Pepper soup and a Grilled Cheese made with Muenster and Pancetta while 50 Shades of Grey is the gummy worms I buy in the Dollar General before I see a movie. Yet, I enjoyed the books. This is not great literature. This is a fun read for people who were \\"Twilight\\" fans and wanted to see Bella and Edward have awesome sex. I will definitely re-read the books. The other 1 star reviews have said it all; poor writing, weak characters, and making a selfish, domineering, control-freak a hero. I read this book because they said it was \\"erotic lit on training wheels.\\" I enjoyed it, but it also showed me that erotic literature is not my thing. Sometimes a book is a good read because it is so terrible. Same reason I read Twilight. Sometimes something is so bad that it is good.
B001CT877Q|4.0|The 2-year gap between True Lies and Eraser forced some action fans into thinking that Big Arn had retired. He had delivered at least one action movie per year since Terminator. Eraser had an awesome trailer, to the tune of Enigma's wonderful \\"I Love You, I'll Kill You\\", that rocked my world in the summer of 1996. I saw virtually every blockbuster that year, and the Eraser trailer was attached to every one of them. It came out out in the UK in the very last week of summer (and my first week back at school). I saw it at the now demolished UCI cinema in Edinburgh with a sold-out audience, mostly filled with guys out for a \\"lad's night\\". The movie was rated 18, and even though I was 3 years below that mark, I still got in, which was fortunate since the cinema version is the only uncut version of the film that has ever been released in the UK. For its VHS and DVD release the mad BBFC saw fit to cut 4 minutes from Eraser, turning it into an incomprehensible mess. It capped-off an awesome summer season (or so my 15-year-old self thought), and put to rest any fears that Big Arn was slowing down (although he has only made 5 action movies, to date, since then).<br /><br />Arn is John Kruger (an amusing choice of name since director Chuck Russell also made the 3rd Nightmare on Elm Street Movie), a Witness Protection Program Agent who is tasked with 'erasing' and protecting a high-level informant who can prove that there are traitors within the US government who are selling weapons to Russian terrorists. Naturally the informant is the lovely, and wide-eyed, Vanessa Williams, who involves herself in a subdued romantic subplot with Kruger. James Caan and the always great James Coburn provide respectable support as Kruger's antagonist and mentor, but the best support is no doubt Robert Pastorelli (an actor who I really liked who died of a heroin overdose in 2004), who plays a previous witness who is eager to please Kruger in his latest, impossible quest.<br /><br />Overall, it's hardly revolutionary, but what makes Eraser stand out from the crowd is the utterly breathtaking (literally) scene in which Kruger escapes a jet, mid-flight, without the comfort of a parachute on his shoulders. It's definitely one of the best action scenes in the last 20 years and, let me tell you, when that scene climaxed in the cinema, the packed audience of 'lads' totally sucked the air out of the auditorium. A massively exciting, and completely exhilarating, scene that never fails to get your heart racing.<br /><br />Alan Silvestri's score is one of the film's more underrated features. Silvestri scored Big Arn's Predator, a famous score in its own right, and while Eraser is not as famous as Predator you should not rule out the integrity of the score. When separated from the movie it is still one of Silvestri's best efforts.<br /><br />I guess the only complaint I could have about Eraser is that it's kinda anti-climatic. The best scene occurs at the end of the second act, leaving the final act pale in comparison. There's no iconic imagery to the film and it seems kinda forgettable when compared to other Arn characters who have endured the test of time. Nonetheless, it's at the top of the bottom of Arn's best movies, but make sure the version you watch has not been butchered by the BBFC.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is in 2.40:1 1080p with Dolby TrueHD sound. Extras are non-existent.hardly revolutionary, but what makes Eraser stand out from the crowd is the utterly breathtaking (literally) scene in which Kruger escapes a jet, mid-flight, without the comfort of a parachute on his shoulders.

0553386794|5.0|I've now read all five books that have come out so far in this series. A Game of Thrones is the first book of the series, and a wonderful introduction.<br />You will begin to care about each character and even develop favorites and not-so-favorites.<br />The Song of Ice and Fire series has really paid off so far, do yourself a favor and don't miss out on this!<br /><br />I am an avid fantasy reader and the prose of George RR Martin's ASOIAF is by far the best
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I recall the 2002 season quite well with the Angels victory but the A's 20 game streak, not so much... Billy was right about only the last game counts.... the way the players are traded so easily like their card counterparts created compassion as well as how underrated athletes were used to average team weakness, amazing insight for a simple fan on the cold hard statistics to finely tune a winning team...  I craved more coverage of the details as they only hinted at the complexities, i.e. one simple equation in initial report and smash cut scans over 2D tables, just a few more discussions citing correlations for player selection would provide compelling insight into the significance of changing the game forever...  the crazed phone trading scheme was over the top to appreciate, can't imagine this scene represented much difference in negotiations but perhaps an omage to the old ways? not sure if this information improves my appreciation for a game that has drama, personalities, surprises, etc.  hence, to optimize sabermetrics may lose that intrinsic love of the game and move inherently towards a more robotic emotionless competition, trying to compare with another sport, oh yeah pro football...

B003L77G6K|4.0|You can read all about the show in the other reviews - I'm sure you can tell that the show is pretty funny, the actors are very comfortable in their roles by season 4, and they bounce off one another nicely.  I won't belabor the greatness of the show.<br /><br />The picture/sound quality of the blu ray offering of season 4 is top notch, the menus are easy to navigate.  I will say however, you must update the firmware on your blu ray player.  This set would not play on my setup until I managed to patch my blu ray player into my home network and get it updating over the web.  Even then, this set seems to tax my blu ray player unlike any other discs I've ever played.  Its like I need a newer player with a faster system or something.  Be warned.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|What a refreshing surprise! I had no expectations going in, and I ended up wanting to give a copy of this movie to everyone I know--young and old. It is a beautiful movie, and it uses its quirky premise to shed light on some of the most fundamental questions of human existence. And it does it all with grace and wit.
0345803507|5.0|I was hesitant to read this with such a touchy subject matter. Then I got drawn in by the great characters within. I am not so sure there are in reality many 22 year old virgins in today's world, and was pleased to find this very romantic in places and the intimancy portrayed went so deeply into the peoples innerselves. Though I thought at times there was just too much sex and detailed sex at that, I found the communication between the couple and the minor charachters intriguing.<br /><br />The writer did something I have often wanted from so many other stories. The epilogue was almost better than the book! We saw into the past in varies ways and as a writer I so loved that. Have always struggled with where to begin as well as where to end; this did all I wanted to know and more. The POV of the child was priceless and so insightful. Skillfully done, and I am a fan. I shall be looking into this authors portfolio for more indepth prose.
B0059XTUXQ|2.0|I was extremely disappointed with this movie.  While Streep's performance was amazing I just shake my head at the approach of the filmmakers.  A looming historical figure like Margaret Thatcher deserves a better film depicting her life.<br /><br />Like many other reviewers I grew weary of the hallucinations and would have preferred a simple telling of Lady Thatcher's fascinating life and politics.  I never felt as if we got a chance to know anyone in the movie, including Thatcher herself.  The only version we see consistently is the Thatcher suffering from dementia.  I find that insulting.<br /><br />The movie glosses over most of her time in office as Prime Minister.  Where was the Cold War?  I believe the Falkland Islands got 5-7 minutes of screen time.  Shocking!<br /><br />A sad telling of an incredible story.

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|An outstanding book to read as a family.  The story and lessons in this book are valuable for any age (including adults) but will be most beneficial to 4th-9th grade students. Teachers looking for a new read should highly consider this one.  The book creates some fascinating discussion points and it literally moves character to character to give the reader a sense of \\"walking a mile in someone else's shoes.\\"<br /><br />Beyond the lessons, the book is engaging, entertaining, and very well written.

0345803485|2.0|I am a 44 year old mom of 4 from Florida who has little time to read. I enjoyed the Twilight Books, as well as the Dragon Tattoo books, so some friends recommended this series. I read all three books in a week. The only reason I forced myself to finish them was because I had already wasted the money and I held out hope that something exciting was actually going to happen!  The main character Ana is a complete Idiot.  I had absolutely no sympathy for her and kept hoping that Christian would beat the @#*! out of her.  If Mr. Grey was poor and had no helicopter would Ana take crap from him?!  Hell no! It was incredibly repetitive. The verbal sparring between the two was cliche and revolting. These two never had a plausible conversation in the entire series. People in love do not talk that way to each other and have sex as many times as they did!  Sometimes you are just not in the mood!  No man is THAT irresistible that this twit would steam her panties from one brush of his finger!  Come on. Did the guy ever have bad breath?  No. I'm not buying the love. I forced myself to finish reading because I kept hoping Ana would discover bodies buried in his basement or some other really disturbing thing that might have provided some suspense and an actual PLOT. What  WAS the plot? Can somebody tell me?  Anyway, I never write reviews but these books left me so wanting and frustrated intellectually that I needed to vent. Don't waste your money. Don't buy into the hype... wait for the movie!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I have been eagerly anticipating this album release since stumbling across the YouTube video of You Ain't Alone (Live at Stubbs).  That video gave me goose bumps and I have built up this album in mind waiting for its release.  I was not disappointed. These folks are not one-trick ponies.  Their LP is diverse and rich and honest.  Can't wait to see what they do next.  I hope the Shakes hit Louisville so I can see them live.
1469984202|5.0|As someone who normally does not read science fiction, I still put WOOL as one of the best books of the decade.  Incredible story that will let your mind imagine a new world and picture yourself in it. At first readers will take pride in their superior knowledge over the characters in the WOOL silos, but eventually you begin to wonder if perhaps similar ignorance controls our own world as well.
0307716546|4.0|Immediately after reading Sister, I knew I wanted to read Afterwards. I even contacted the publisher to see when they would be releasing it in the US. That is how much Ms. Lupton's writing and storytelling affected me. When I read the description for Afterwards it reminded me a bit of Lisa Scottoline's Save Me but after a few pages I knew the only thing they had in common was a mother trying to rescue her child. There is so much to say about this book but yet so much I can't say because it will truly ruin the experience for you. It is unlike any other book I have ever read because of the manner in which Ms. Lupton unfolds the story. We are quickly introduce to Grace Covey as she's attending the Sports Day at her 8 year old son, Adam's private school. Not only does Adam go there but her daughter Jenny is acting as school nurse for the day. It is the picture of serenity until Grace sees smoke billowing into the sky coming from the direction of the school. Grace doesn't even think to hesitate as she runs into the burning building looking for Jenny.<br /><br />Of course Grace's actions have repercussions as both her and Jenny are sent to the hospital fighting for their lives. What happens next during the investigation into the fire is a roller coaster ride until the very end. I had so many theories all of which turned out to be very wrong. I wanted to them to look at the family for some reason. I felt that Jenny was hiding something by trying to prove she is capable of being an adult. Was she hiding something, yes but it wasn't anything like I assumed.<br /><br />What this novel makes you acutely aware of is that things aren't always as they appear. Sometimes you think you know someone, then you find out something that hits you over the head and then you wonder if you ever even knew them. Not only that but at times we all make assumptions and when our assumptions turn out to be wrong, either good or bad, how do we deal with that? How do we process it and move on from it?<br /><br />At the end of the book, I felt that all of the characters had grown, particularly Grace who discovered somethings about herself that might not have been easy but they were truthful. Her husband Mike also grew. He grew into the father he needed to be to Adam and the father Adam needed. I am hopeful that this experience also changed Jenny. That maybe she'll be o.k. in the end.<br /><br />The only thing that kept this from being a 5 for me was the ending. I felt that all in all it was a little too neat for me. A bit too bow tied on nicely especially given the ordeal. I'm not saying I didn't appreciate the ending because I most certainly did since it had me up late and bawling like a baby, but it didn't seem like something that might happen in real life.<br /><br />I really hope that one of you reads this book quickly because I'm dying to discuss it with someone who has read it. It is a book that will spawn plenty of discussion in a book club or amongst friends. I can't say enough about Ms. Lupton's writing. She is an author that I highly recommend to anyone and I look forward to any novel she writes in the future.

0393088774|1.0|Mr. Krugman as a faithful follower of Mr. Keynes,  leverages a set of logical fallacies to hide his agenda.<br />His agenda is simple - justify taking money from the earners (via taxes or inflation) and spending these money on whatever the ruling elite wants.<br />Yes, some crumbles will be given to the voters, but the majority will go to corporations, banks , unions and other friends of the government.<br />Then Mr. Krugman will explain away the total failure of this to revive economy by crying wolf and claiming \\"not enough money were taken from producers and given to the government to waste\\".<br />he never mentions that the money NOT extracted via taxes (or the purchasing value not stolen via inflation) would be still spent, but by people who earned the money on something they value.<br />This is how economy directs resources to the right locaiton - by having millions of people vote with their owns wallets. What Mr. Krugman proposes (central planning for how to spend expropriated resources) is known to be super inefficient and immoral.<br /><br />Stopping for a second and thinking about what Mr. Krugman is saying will expose complete lack of logic and common sense. Borrowing to generate demand misses the key point - this demand is impossible to sustain, since it is not backed by production, just by borrowing ; so his suggestion just paves the way for much more painful crash. We saw this in housing, and will see that in wherever these artifitial bubbles created by money printing will find there way this time<br /><br />It is truly scary how many people are duped by Mr. Krugman and other court economists.

0345803485|5.0|I am not into reading BDSM normally, but this book had my attention. It was so good that I couldn't put it down. Now I'm dying to read the next two books in the trilogy. I recommend this read.
B005B0QYMM|4.0|I actually thought this was gonna be a funny film making fun of Zak and the boys on the Ghost Adventures show. It opens with the premise of a guy who narrates our way into the \\"recorded footage\\". You see them pay off some guy to say there were ghosts, the theatrics they place to make the non-happenings as exciting. As the film progressed, I had realized they were not spoofing the show at all, but it starts to really get creepy. I think thats what made it scarier for me was that I was expecting to laugh.<br /><br />But whats starts as little incidents of rappings, lights going on and off and the usual \\"what was that!?\\" hysteria. But then the s**t really starts to hit the fan and it becomes unrelentless. Some of the logic gets thrown askew for scare tactics, and if you are critical of the human response factor to a situation such as this, then it might take away some of the appreciation of the scares. The one criticism I have of ALL found footage film is the inability to let go of the camera for any reason. So much so that people will die holding it. I dont get the impression is used only for a light source.<br /><br />It takes place in an abandoned mental hospital (of course!) And like all abandoned mental hospitals, bad things have happened there and have left an indelible scar upon its psyche. So, now the ghosts who were once patients run the asylum and are more mad than they were in life.<br /><br />There are lots of cameras and I must have missed some of the set up, but there seems to be lots of angles besides the single camera.<br /><br />The \\"apparitions\\" manifest are not really ghosts, but seems physical and demonic beings of a sort. So I am not sure what they are. Despite these logical loopholes, there are some very good special effects and a bigger budget is at hand than it might appear.<br /><br />Overall, I found this a very good scare film in the vain of Paranormal Activity and the like, but I actually find this one scarier and unsuspecting. .Recommended!!!

0345803485|1.0|It is completely beyond my understanding how anyone could possibly give this book a 3-4 star rating; I wanted to give it a zero but that isn't an option. I don't think I've ever read anything more poorly written and the idea that this author has been able to write two more novels with the same characters, and probably the same vocabulary, boggles the mind. The first thing she needs to do is get herself a good thesaurus; there really are other exclamatory remarks beyond \\"oh c**p\\" & another fecal reference, which Amazon has forced me to edit out although it was a direct quote from this incredibly awful book. It's not that I find them offensive, just that I got tired of reading the same thing over & over. Her characters are not the least bit interesting & their gasping all the time made me wonder if they ought to be on some kind of medication.<br />Today I paged through the next two volumes in my local Costco, the vocabulary looked to be pretty much the same - definitely not worth my time or money.<br />The worst of it is that I paid $10.00 for the kindle version & can't get my money back!

0439023491|3.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" explores the political ramifications of Katniss and Peeta surviving \\"[[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]]\\" a couple months later.  Valuable details about the other Districts and some political maneuvering intermix with the strange three way love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale.  The President and his extreme regime create many troubles for District 12.  The story may be disturbing with the additional violence.<br /><br />As the duo tour the other Districts and the Capitol, they experience the bitter sweet emotions having outlasted the other tributes and begin to understand Haymitch's struggles as a previous winner.  All their lives become more intense as the upcoming annual event takes a turn for the worse.  A side note following the prior novel, I am unclear what ever happened with the tracker implanted into their arm.<br /><br />While entertaining, I felt the plot lacked a little originality like it's \\"The Hunger Games Revisited\\" or should have been an expanded edition onto the original.  There are instances of great surprise but for the most part the premise and predictability didn't keep me as engrossed as I hoped.<br /><br />I recommend the series to any fan of the survival action genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
B005HP2J66|4.0|This movie was recommended to us by our guide at Mammoth Cave National Park (thanks, Joe!).  Because of the need to record the cave quickly and then seal it again to preserve it, the entire movie was shot in a matter of weeks from a narrow catwalk through the cave, and the participants were walking about in single file.  The constraints of making the film in this way don't detract from its magic -- the images within the cave, and the descriptions of Cro-Magnon technology delivered by the scientific team were top-rate.  Many parts of the film were obviously shot with lots of background noise, and those parts have a musical score imposed over them.  Its atonality -- dare I say screechiness? -- was often painful to listen to.<br /><br />Interestingly, a flute found from this time period has been reconstructed and scientists have discovered that it was pentatonic -- that it used the same musical scale as Pythagoras described and we still call \\"musical.\\"  One of the scientists played it on camera, in fact!  Why the pentatonic scale was left behind for the music of the film is more than I can say... must be a French thing.<br /><br />If you watch the bonus material, you can see the World's Whitest Band recording the music.<br /><br />I would be very much interested to know about the skull of the cave bear placed on a shaped rock.  Was it put there as a landmark or a ritual object?  Something like, \\"leave your water bladders at the cave bear skull and turn left to the deeper cave\\" sort of thing?  Or even to mark a particularly acoustical part of the cave?  I also wonder how many of the designs were painted as landmarks or to denote interesting echoes/sound effects.<br /><br />Very interesting.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really liked the game however after making it around level 40 it glitched.  I couldn't collect,  crops stopped growing and I couldn't craft anything in the infirmary or workshop.  Also, I am not willing to pay real cash for play money; there should be a way to earn cash in the game or have a coin option.  Besides, when I did try the purchase button, the deal in the game didn't match what Amazon offered; less bang for the buck.

B003XCVQ3C|2.0|Be warned everyone. This product has stopped working on me. I used it lightly for several months then my screen started flickering. I would have to have something pressed against the cable for it to work and keep a signal then eventually nothing would get it to work. Look at all of the reviews on Amazon and Apple's website and notice how many people have had the same issue with this product dying unexpectedly. Some people, like me, have gotten it to work for several months but some people only get one or two uses out of it. BE WARNED!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This was fun, until all of my timers reset. I'm waiting to hear back from customer service, so I started building new houses and businesses. Well, my timers were down to 100 hours, then it force closed and reset my timers to over 500 hours, including all of my new buildings! It also reset my full energy bar to zero. How can you even play when you have to wait two weeks to collect anything? Awful awful awful. I know I'm not the only one with this problem and I cant believe it hasn't been addressed yet. Get it together, Gameloft!
B006QKJQM6|1.0|First off let me say I loved the movie. Loved it so much I purchased a digital copy to download and keep on my Kindle Fire. The problem came when according to Amazon tech help, DreamWorks decided they were not making enough sells in the DVD area, and blocked this from the streaming content on what they called a blackout period. Which in return caused Amazon to remove my purchased copy from my Kindle and block me from the streaming version. Amazon did return my money but it has made me very cautious about making future digital purchases. Just a warning to any buying digital movies from Dreamworks.

0307949486|2.0|I wanted to find out what all the fuss was about. Larsson's debut novel and the two sequels that were published either simultaneously or else in rapid succession have topped Best Sellers lists for what feels like forever. As happened previously to me with the first Harry Potter book and The DaVinci Code, curiosity won out. I was unable to let the cult phenomenon pass me by. As you can tell by my 2-star rating, I was not overwhelmed when finally getting around to reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I think it's worthy of a 2.5 star review, but that not being an option I chose to round down rather than up. If the series of books had not each sold a gazillion copies perhaps I would have rounded in the other direction. But bottom line is that I've given 3-star reviews to many books that were superior to this one. The character this novel is named after is its strength, even if the story is not primarily about her. Her distinctive personality and outlook set her apart from cookie cutter characters to be found in many genre titles. But the writing was mediocre at best and as for the plot, it's engaging but by no means tremendously original. This is a whodunnit, but the ending is not especially difficult to guess at least partially if not completely. I don't even consider myself a particularly strong follower of clues in mystery novels, but one does not need to be Nostradamus to make accurate predictions here. I'm by no means trashing the book. It's fairly engaging and certainly easy to read. But my verdict is that unlike many, I don't feel compelled to read parts 2 & 3. I can wait until the inevitable movie adaptations hit cable.

B00777ZCYI|2.0|I was very unhappy today when my order had arrived.  I had been waiting very patiently for my LP to arrive from the UK.  I had ordered a new copy of Michael Kiwanuka's Home Again LP and when I opened the box, I was astonished to see a vinyl that not only was not shrink wrapped but the sleeve was not even in the cover and it was very torn up.  The vinyl even has a small scratch on it.  I have never written a review before but I was so upset that I needed to vent.  I understand that if I had ordered something used but I ordered something new and it was not new at all.  I can't believe that this has happened.  It took over a month for my order to come and when it showed it was not even shrink wrapped.  I manage an independent record store and I understand that things can be a little worn from being in a retail environment but this was not shop worn at all.  It should have never been sent in this condition.

B0055EAJ7A|2.0|The filming and shots in this film mostly do not lend themselves to project 3D.  Not exactly sure why it is just not that impressive.  And the story is really weak. Not even remotely close to as good as Ironman. The love interest that develops between Thor and Natalie Portman makes no sense.  There is nothing that happens to explain it other than they are attractive specimens.  Had high hopes for something with Anthony Hopkins, Renee Russo and Natalie Portman in it but it was not to be.
0312576463|4.0|The pluses. Franzen is a fantastic writer and towards the end of this rambling novel I was absorbed, truly felt I knew and understood the main characters, and found myself caring and hoping for the best. The minuses. I think Franzen could have accomplished just as much with not nearly as much. He gives a great deal of detail about areas that I frankly did not care all that much about. I am marginally interested at best in bird migration patterns and the environmental politics of overpopulation. Even if I found these subjects to be fascinating, when reading a novel I'd still want less data and more story. A good novel is often one that is well researched, but there's sharing information in a way that's interesting and advances the narrative, and then there's oversharing every bit of knowledge acquired on a topic whether critical to plot development or not. Some readers will be strongly tempted to skim certain parts of this novel, and if they do I can't say they'd miss all that much. They certainly wouldn't lose track of the storyline, which considering the bulk and page count of Freedom is relatively straight forward despite not being told in linear fashion. It's the story of a marriage, the two people within it and the loved ones closest to it. The couple has two children, a boy who a considerable portion of the book focuses on, and a girl who is really just a secondary character. Had it been the other way around the story would have been minimally impacted. The most significant person in Walter and Patty's lives is Richard Katz. Walter basically has a guy crush on the college roommate who ends up becoming a rock star, and Patty has romantic/sexual interest that eventually is acted upon. Walter eventually gets a romantic interest outside of the marriage as well, the much younger Lalitha who works with him and basically lives with them. Patty is jealous of Lalitha from the get go even though Walter is about as loyal a guy as you can find. This is just one of many ways that she has managed to become increasingly overbearing. Good old Walter trusts both his wife and best friend completely until he finds out that they have betrayed him, which is especially overwhelming since their relationship got started in the first place when Patty didn't screw Walter over by screwing his best friend, though this is due to Richard's restraint, not Patty's. The latter part of the book, after Walter finds out about the affair his wife finally allows herself to have along with the rather poor opinions she's held about him throughout their relationship, is by far the strongest section and ultimately made it worth reading through to the end. I'm glad that I overrode my impulse to quit on account of waning interest in the lives of rather self absorbed people. Franzen writes about these characters rather than through them, which makes it harder to care about them, particularly when what they're doing and going through is not all that riveting. But he writes so well I held fast to the belief that if I kept with it, I would eventually be rewarded for my perseverance. And so I was. I know there are people who think more highly of this book than do I because Franzen received much public praise for it. I also know people who gave up on it rather than pushing through, and I see their point of view as well. Hence this mixed review. But since more credit is given for finishing than starting strong, I'm generously giving Freedom 4 out of 5 stars. His prose earns my upmost respect. The ultimate thing a novel should accomplish though is not achieving a certain rating, but making readers want to read the author's next book. I'm not sure if that will be the case with Franzen based on how hard he needlessly made me fight to make it through this one.
