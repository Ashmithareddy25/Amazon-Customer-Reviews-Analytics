B004ZNA5JO|3.0|Let's face it: After The Wall, Pink Floyd as a unit were never the same; one could even argue they weren't the same after Wish You Were Here, and the Final Cut, to me, will always be considered a Roger Waters record with two members of Pink Floyd being present. After much wrangling through lawyers, contracts, courts and countersuits, Gilmour and Mason were granted permission and awarded the right to continue as Pink Floyd confirming once and for all, that Waters had simply exited the group(even though his ego may have alluded otherwise). And so, with Bob Ezrin in tow with co-production and also instrumental aid, David Gilmour cultivates HIS vision of moving forward with 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason. Learning to Fly would be culled as the single and is definable and successful as an updated fascimile of late 80's era Floyd. The first half of the record shows Gilmour writing with collaborators such as Ezrin, session Keysman Jon Carin, Anthony Moore and Pat Leonard including another definable and beautiful gem in On the Turning Away. Dogs of War has a tendency to be a bit &#34;by numbers&#34; here and smells of self-parody while One Slip is a strong track but serves better as a solo piece that would've fit well on Gilmour's prior About Face record.  The second half of Lapse is really where the appeal of this record lies, starting with Yet Another Movie and on through an instrumental Round and Around, these tracks consolidate and give relevance to this current aggregation led by Gilmour, despite the number of session player credits(albeit some very talented ones, i.e. Tony Levin, Carmine Appice, Tom Scott and Bill Payne to name a few). Then begins an even more Floydian flavor with The New Machine segments split into 2 parts with the blissful and tuneful Terminal Frost instrumental as its centerpiece. This track is drenched in jazz/rock and is driven by the soprano and tenor sax arrangements by Tom Scott and Scott Page respectively. Despite the fact that the albumdoesn't properly give track by track personnel credits, thereby making one wonder how true of a comeback release it is, Ezrin's production and Gilmour's arrangement values are impeccably contemporary, innovative and seamlessly cohesive enough to see this recording through, and ultimately Momentary Lapse is a success, for the most part. The record closes with Sorrow which has a bit of darkness about itself, but is a most strong closer to a record that offers up Gilmour's vision of Pink Floyd mach III in a most convincing manner. I give Lapse 3 and a half stars because while I feel the musicianship is very good and professionally played, along with a strong production and arrangement value as its other solid point, its still not a true Floyd record without the involvement of Roger Waters. Just as I had criticized the Final Cut in not having Wright or Gilmour involved within the songwriting process of that record, the same applies to this one from the other side of the coin, as it were. Although Wright appears in the credits to this album, it wouldn't be confirmed of his actual studio contributions to this phase of the group until 94's Division Bell, which were much more realized and complete there. 3 and a half Stars.

B008JH5FZ6|4.0|The movie follows a plot similar to \\"Escape from New York City,\\" but other than Guy Pearce as Snow, it lacks memorable characters. In 2079, Guy is convicted of murder and espionage. In order to beat the rap he must rescue the President's daughter from an orbiting space prison...apparently built after a crazy ideas man gets elected president. I started making a list of the science flaws and quit after half a page. My other column for absurdities was equally as long. Clearly this is a \\"leave your brain at the door\\" movie.<br /><br />Guy is a wise cracking individual. His humor is enjoyable, even if corny at times. Of course the President's daughter (Maggie Grace) objects to being the only hostage being rescued. Good comedy-action sci-fi story.<br /><br />F-bomb, no sex, no nudity.

B008EEWN6I|5.0|I never liked System of a Down...maybe a song here and there, but never bought more than a song or two from them. I also wasn't thrilled with Serj's first two solo projects. But, this one? OMG, what an awesome album. From pure, rockin metal to thought-provoking alt-metal that leaves you feeling like you just got slapped with the truth! Serj really knows how to get a message across, and his musical genius is allowed to blossum on this release...a complete 180 from the SOAD days. I love this album!!!

0375869026|4.0|Wonder is a book about a boy who is not deformed but has a very rare birth defect. The defect is that his facial features aren't like a normal boy. This book is good for kids going into middle school because it is saying that you should be yourself. And that to not let bullies or other kids ruin your life by making fun of or by doing something else mean to you. At first the book is sort of weird but gets more understanding as you read. I liked the book and it helped me look at other people i a different way. What helped me most with this was the charter Via (August's sister) she has always been protecting him and helping him for his whole life. This book wasn't as exciting as the other books I have read but it was still a good book.
030758836X|1.0|I just finished Gone Girl and am left shaking my head. Although the foundation of the story could have been interesting, the writing was so tedious and, I'm sorry, childish, that the idea got lost. I don't understand the rave reviews, and I don't understand how it has topped book charts for so long.<br /><br />Maybe this is what modern writing has become. Flynn may be an author, but she is not a writer. There is nothing unusual in her word choice. There is nothing compelling about her pacing. Most authors who are not real writers are at least good storytellers, like John Grisham. Flynn is neither.<br /><br />If you want to understand writing, REAL writing, read Pat Conroy's \\"My Reading Life\\". He talks about the great writers who influenced him and very specifically why. He has notebooks of interesting words, turns of phrases, ideas. Then he masterfully, like an artist with words, creates vivid writing that absolutely leaps off the page. That is what writing should be.<br /><br />If writing like Flynn's becomes the standard, count me out.

B0036OS3MO|5.0|I purchased these boots 3 years ago and I am in love with them.  They are so comfortable and warm.  I have worn them for 2 winters now and I am looking forward to another winter in them.  They are not slippery and my feet never get cold wearing them.  I walk outside for 60minutes every day (even when it is bitterly cold) and I have always relied on these with very little problem.  They are really cute too and I get a lot of compliments on them from people who are shocked that they are crocs.
B004OC07N0|4.0|I liked the focus on the first 90 days in a new managerial role: tips for building credibility quickly, and tips for embarking on fixing what needs fixing while preserving what needs preserving. I liked the idea of breaking the first 90 days into 30-day chunks, with subplans for each stage. I liked the STaRS model as a way to characterize the situation: Startups where the whole group is creating something new; Turnarounds where you've got a fixer-upper and they know it; Realignments where they need some course corrections but not everyone knows or agrees; and Sustaining success where they're doing well and need to maintain it and grow. It was a useful model for comparing the likely challenges, opportunities, and areas of focus. I liked the insight that the STaRS model can apply at multiple levels: from a single project to a divisional unit to the whole company.<br /><br />One aspect of the STaRS model struck me as needing elaboration. Different STaRS situations were, in part, characterized by whether the people involved agreed on how well things were going and what direction to take. That seemed unrealistically oversimplified. There'll often be people who are on board and those who aren't. The question is who. Maybe senior management has a consensus, but your staff doesn't. Maybe your staff has a consenus, but it's not the same as management's, and then your key customers have yet another view. Sometimes you've got overall consensus in one group or another, but one or two key people within the group see the situation differently. With each of the four situations in the STaRS model, it should be important to know where you have agreement on status and directions, and where you don't.<br /><br />The book had its weak spots. Sometimes, the advice was overly simplistic, to the point that it felt like padding. I should set realistic goals? I should ask good questions? No kidding, really? I wouldn't think that anyone in a new managerial role would consciously plan to setbad goals and ask bad questions. (Their goals and questions might turn out to be bad, but they didn't go into the situation wanting to do the job poorly.) Also, the author's advice sometimes strayed quite far from business. Talk to me about the different challenges facing startups and turnarounds, sure, but I don't think he's qualified to tell me how to maintain a work-life balance (Chapter 9).<br /><br />I had hoped the checklists at the end of each chapter would offer practical steps toward creating and implementing a 90-day plan, including good tips on when to do various things. Instead, the checklist items were rather nebulous and non-directive. The \\"checklist\\" label was a misnomer, compared to what I normally expect from a checklist. With each new chapter, I spent less and less time reading the checklist.<br /><br />The anecdotes that started each chapter didn't do anything for me. Every one of them fell into one of two forms: a) Jane Doe succeeded by doing what I'm about to tell you to do, or b) Jane Doe failed by not doing what I'm about to tell you to do. They felt like simplistic self-justification, not insightful explorations of the advice being offered.<br /><br />I would have liked some summary comparisons, for later reference and reminder, of the different STaRS situations, and a summary structure for the elements of the 90-day plan. This is all stuff that was strewn throughout the book, but some reference summaries would have been helpful.<br /><br />All in all, though, there was good advice in the book, especially in comparing different aspects of the STaRS model. The book is suitable for anyone in a new leadership role. I don't see why some people are saying this is for senior leadership only. A new front-line supervisor could benefit from a 90-day plan too.<br /><br />The Kindle version worked pretty well. I saw that some older reviews of the Kindle version complained about badly formatted tables and so on. That appears to have been resolved. The tables and figures are intact. However, you can't resize them and they don't use your chosen text size, so you might find them hard to read. The table of contents was pretty good, covering the chapters and the front and end matter, but not the subsections within chapters.

I think it is better than her other books by this author and by the end I had to finish the book as fast as I could because I absolutely had to know what was going to happen.  The last entry of the book was amazing, such a perfect way to end it.  Definitely recommend it.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|First I want to say this is a really classic collaboration between Beck and Stewart and every track is great. I will resist the temptation to say neither man has done anything better since. I love Jeff's later fusion stuff (for example, check out What Mama Said with Jennifer Batten, Rollin and Tumblin with Imogene Heap, or Cause We've Ended as Lovers with in the group with Tal Wilkenfeld) and of course Rod went on to do a lot of great stuff where a flashy guitarist would have been a distraction. But the collaboration here works perfectly. Unfortunately Rod was too good to be in somebody else's group for long.<br /><br />I want to take issue with the fellow who criticized the inclusion of Ole Man River. I had this album as a kid and considered Ole Man River one of the highlights. It's a perfect vehicle for Stewart, who loves to ham it up on these slow spiritual-like numbers (check out their glorious cover of Curtis Mayfield's 'People Get Ready' in a similar vein.) It's a perfect vehicle for Beck too, because the song gives him plenty of holes to fill. Interweaving with Rod's hoarse-voiced, melodramatic posturing, Jeff sets off roman candle riffs bursting with melody and whiplash electronic flourishes while the tympani thunder away in the background. It's just magnificent and if you don't like it what are you doing listening to Rod Stewart? The man is basically Broadway from tip to toe. And there's no shortage of theatricality in Jeff's betcha-never-heard-THIS-before guitar work either. This disc is not for Robert Johnson fans, at least not when they're (we're) in a somber, worshipful mood. It's for people who think playing and listening to blues should be FUN! - a politically incorrect thought. It's no accident that Beck went on to collaborate with members of Vanilla Fudge, a band known for incredibly bombastic covers of other people's two-minute songs, which sounded fabulous but were too over the top to be taken seriously by critics. I think Jeff was drawn to the Fudge by their deliberate excessiveness and opulent sound. Rod and Jeff are a dynamite combo but there's a playfulness, sometimes bordering on self-parody, in their work, which is as it should be. If you believe in sound for sound's sake and don't care whether they lyrics contain profound insights into the human condition, you're the right audience.

0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games has some flaws, many of which are pointed out in these reader reviews.  I found it difficult to follow the first person, present tense narrative for the first 50 pages before my mind and eyes settled in on that writing style.  It has been accused of plagiarizing Battle Royale and Collins' character development skills have come under question.  The totalitarian society lacks definition and there are some amazing twists that solve pressing plot problems.  All this is true, however...<br /><br />Not every book needs to be perfectly done.  Not all books define characters in a satisfying way and most books take thoughts and ideas from other works.  To define a \\"good read\\" one only has to answer the question \\"does it take you away from the day-to-day for a few hours and interest you in a different world?\\"<br /><br />Good books provide an escape and maintain a level of anticipation that keeps the reader wondering what comes next.  How will our protagonists get out of this mess?  On these accounts, The Hunger Games is a good book and I'm confident that the second and third books will have the same positive attributes.<br /><br />It has the additional benefit of being wildly popular with young readers.  Middle and high school students have embraced and devoured these books in unprecedented numbers.  Before the admonishments on the brutality and cruelty exhibited in The Hunger Games, I'm sure our teens have seen much worse on cable tv and video games.  The fact that it has attracted a veritable army of teenage \\"readers\\" only bodes well for the future literacy of our young ones.  Sure, its not Shakespeare, but reading anything at this age is way better than reading nothing at all and it may just light a spark of interest which someday may become a raging fire.<br /><br />If you doubt me, read it yourself.  It's worth the price.  And while you're at it, buy one for your teenage child, niece, nephew, grandkid or neighbor.  That is, if they haven't already read it.<br /><br />John E.

0451228375|4.0|I read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" many years ago and had forgotten almost all the details. If there was a connection to that in \\"World Without End,\\" I missed it. This novel takes place in 14th century England, over a 30 year period. It is a plot-driven novel filled with political intrigue with the church and royalty at the center. There are clear villains and heroes with few shades of gray. While not believable, Follett manipulates the reader in obvious ways, but he does it in such a fun way, I was happy to go along for the ride. The language and personalities seem more like 21st century people transplanted in the 14th century. That makes for much less realism, but an easier novel to read. This is escape fiction, and not a serious historical novel, but it is escape fiction that entertained me for 1000 pages. I should say that the first 100 pages were a little slow, overwhelming me with background info, but the next 900 pages made up for that.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love the way that the story is written. Its very different but also very easy to get into. I wish I would have bought this book sooner!
1476712042|5.0|I was so excited to get my hands on an advanced reader of Beautiful Disaster, as I had heard so many different thoughts on the book. I wanted to read the book so that I could form my own opinion of the story. I have to say, this book is a roller-coaster ride, and will leave you with very mixed emotions.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy has a secret past, one that she has run a long way from. A new school with new friends, a new beginning is exactly what she needs. All is well, until she catches the attention of the school bad boy, Travis Maddox, who is completely blown away by her resistance to him.  Never one to be rejected, Travis does whatever he can to get Abby into his life. But can Abby live with the dominating Travis in her life?<br /><br />Abby, the main character, was both headstrong and also extremely frustrating. I love that she stood up to Travis's crazy ways, for the most part, especially when there were red flags going up all over the place. However, it was insanely frustrating that she used other guys just to hurt Travis. It really made me want to shake her and tell her to quit playing games. But other than that, I found her to be a likeable character.<br /><br />The thing I love most in male characters is the tortured hero. I don't know what it is, but I can't get enough of them. Travis is definitely a tortured soul.  My heart broke for him multiple times, but I also found him infuriating at times as well. He was such a completely complex character; I still haven't completely figured him out. Yes, he was overbearing and quite dominant, but he also had a completely different side to him as well, and that's the side that I fell in love with. He broke my heart more than a few times with his emotions. I love this man.  (On a side note; I totally picture Travis as Channing Tatum! Check out his movie Fighter, and you will see why.)<br /><br />The secondary characters were interesting as well, with my favorites being Shepley, Travis's cousin and America, who was Abby's best friend. America was a really great friend to Abby. There was also Finch, who Abby and America met on their first day of school, who was a loner just like Abby. I love him!<br /><br />If you love a good love story, full of emotional angst and drama, this is definitely the book for you. I loved the storyline as well. That kept me hooked, and flying through the pages faster than I expected to.<br /><br />There were a few small issues that I had with the book, however. As an adult that knows the difference between right and wrong, I found this book to be a fascinating read. As a mom to a teenage girl, I have many issues with the book. I can't imagine a teenager reading this and understanding how many things were wrong with relationship. For that one reason, I wouldn't recommend this for the younger YA crowd. (I had this problem with Twilight as well. While the story is romantic and understandable by most, younger girls that are easily swayed may not see the problems with the relationship; the possessiveness, the codependency, etc.) This book also contains a great deal of violence, sex, underage drinking, and vulgar language.  As an adult, this doesn't make me love the book any less, but as a parent, it makes me cautious with my extremely sheltered child. (That's just me though!)<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book, so much more than I expected to. This is a book that will stick with you long after you've read the last page. I can't wait for my finished copy to arrive so that I can read it again!  Also, we will also be getting a book in 2013 that is Beautiful Disaster from Travis's perspective; Walking Disaster. I SO can't wait to get my hands on it!<br /><br />Happy Reading!bby's best friend. America was a really great friend to Abby.

The athlete that performed the feats for the picture wore \\"convict clothes\\" instead  of normal ones (ski cap, wife beater, baggy jeans, and dark socks and shoes). The athlete has nothing to do with jail and coach wade couldn't have gotten someone to wear normal clothes. In summation the book is very informative but the whole jail/convict thing is stretched way to much and excuse my language  its bullshit.

0061452068|5.0|Three Views of the Future<br /><br />In general, worldwide has man's quality of life been improving or worsening in the last 100 years, or the last 20 years?  And is the future a bright or troubled one?  Many who bother themselves with such concerns  see a threatening future; there is concern about environmental damage,  unsustainable consumption of resources, and institutional failure.  In the latter case the nature of the perceived failure depends on an individual's ideological inclinations.  Matt Ridley (R) in his book,  \\"The Rational Optimist\\",  Thomas Homer-Dixon (H-D), his book- \\"The Upside of Down\\". and Richard Heinberg (H), in \\"The End of Growth\\",  provide three different scenarios for mankind's future.  Ridley' s  optimistic assessment of the future is based on mankind's past success, the overall upward trend in man's quality of life, including especially the recent dramatic improvements due to technological innovations. In contrast, Homer-Dixon and Heinberg imagine a more difficult future which will require substantial changes in the way we manage our affairs, but they have different emphases and scope.  H-D's view is through the prism of societies' occasional failures.  H-D. especially and H. in some particulars are more concerned with institutional structures and operations of societies: government, business, financial, etc. while R emphasizes progress in technology, medicine agriculture, etc.  Heinberg predicts  a dramatic change in the trajectory of the world's economies due to increasing cost of exploiting  the world's  natural resources.<br /><br />Ridley's book's subtitle frames his narrative: \\"How Prosperity Evolved\\". . He argues that the history of cultural and technology innovation that led to the remarkable achievements of the past 200,000 years  provides reason to expect a continued upward trending path despite the incidence of incompetent governance, dysfunctional institutions, and bureaucracy, both public and private.  An example of  his supporting evidence: between 1955 and 2000 wealth per capita tripled worldwide.  Ridley's prescription for future success-maximize the opportunity for innovation and promote growth which is necessary for the improved welfare for all. The important thing for Ridley is that barriers to innovation be minimized and that this will be accomplished by encouraging the creativity of individuals and entrepreneurs acting particularly in small and flexible organizations and freeing up markets to facilitate such activities.<br /><br />Thomas Homer-Dixon's approach in \\"The Upside of Down\\"  uses a historical perspective to examine the mechanisms that lead to societal failure illustrated for instance by the Roman empire and he draws parallels with those situations and now.  More than the other two authors he pays attention to the operation of societies'  institutions, their decision making strategies and mechanisms for coping with challenges  Although he views future challenges as daunting, as can be seen from his title, he doesn't foresee inevitable decline, rather he sees the challenges as opportunities whose confrontation can lead to new heights of achievement for mankind.  Homer-Dixon along with Ridley stresses the need to promote innovation but H-D's major concern is institutional structures while Ridley's emphasis is on technological development  H-D sees the need for more collective action but not necessarily government action which often serves the desires of economic elites.  For H-D a basic problem is that institutions naturally would rather deal with failures incrementally than attempt fundamental reform and restructuring.  Generally the coping process involves denial first  and then when a situation is sufficiently threatening incremental repairs are attempted including added bureaucracy.  Society's cultural structures: bureaucracy, urban systems, the military, economic arrangements, and the legal system tend to grow more complex.  The result is prolongation of the tried and true  with the expectation of minimizing harm in the short term usually while protecting the interests of the powerful.  The problem is<br />that such development is accompanied by increasing rigidity, instability, and inefficiency.  Often managers and \\"experts\\"  are poor at prediction and fail because they don't understand the complex, dfficult-to-manage systems that they've  created.  Our tax and financial systems, and the bureaucratic response to 9/11 are examples that come to mind. Such behavior is characteristic of all of man's institutions. Homer-Dixon relates this process to the thermodynamic concept of entropy- the more complex the system the more energy required to maintain it's organization.<br /><br />Heinberg focuses more narrowly on two topics:  the first,  economic and financial policy and performance and the second,  the impact on the economy of growing constraints on  exploitation of natural resources-especially energy. For Heinberg (as for Ridley) the foundation for the spectacular improvements of the last 150 years is consumption of cheap-to-reclaim but ultimately limited nonrenewables. But fossil fuel production cannot continue to Increase indefinitely.  The cost of exploitation- the \\"low hanging fruit\\" or \\"diminishing return\\" concept applies to fossil fuels, valuable ores, water, land, etc. which experience increasing marginal costs of exploitation as they are depleted.  For instance, deep-ocean oil is more expensive than oil produced on dry land.  The concept of \\"Peak Oil\\" -when discovery of new fields no longer keeps up with the increasing consumption driven by economic development and an increasing population (and declining per capita share) derives from this reality. For renewables, the rate of replenishment controls the consumption rate  And while substitution of nonrenewables helps with the supply issue,  its also true that  they're generally more costly and they have their own substantial environmental impacts. Given this reality he argues that  there will be increasing downward force on economic growth.<br /><br />A second harmful factor is the proliferation of negative environmental impacts. As do many others he sees increasing future risk caused by population growth for at least the next 60 years, citing the environmental destruction seen, for instance, in the Amazon basin and S.E. Asia. He argues that it will be difficult for financial systems to adjust to reduced resource availability and increasing environmental real costs.  Again this will be a drag on economic growth.<br /><br />Like H-D but less broadly he considers political and financial factors which are not central in Ridley's narrative.  Regarding economics he sees our future put at risk because of the accumulation of unsustainable levels of debt.  This is the result of the failure of individuals, their political representatives, and business organizations to concern themselves with  long-term consequences and fiscal integrity.  He doesn't see cause for optimism given voter's incapacity to deal with the increasingly complex issues they confront, the role of media in reducing the quality of civil discourse, and the corruption endemic in systems where those possessing great wealth may use it to advance their own interests at the expense of the rest.<br /><br />Ridley stresses that he is not a Panglossian and doesn't ignore the \\"bumpy\\" nature of the upward slope. Referring to current political and economic issues, he refers to  \\"rent-seekers and influence-peddlers\\" and the need to combat corruption and inefficiency, damning both corporate and  government disfunction.  He is clear when extolling the efficiencies of markets that they are useful for providing goods and services but that unregulated markets for financial assets are dangerous.  He remarks on the danger resulting from the increasingly  integrated nature of the world which makes possible the impact of \\"foolish  ideas\\" on large populations.  It's clear he doesn't fit into the right-wing ideological slots generally associated with his optimistic outlook.<br /><br />He refers specifically to the time between 1100 and 1150 when three great nation states simultaneously followed reactionary paths and discouraged innovation that led to long term<br />decline. The Ming Dynasty pursued retrograde policies for several hundred years that put China on a downward trajectory and Mao's policies extended that trend.  But  there remained enclaves that didn't follow along and progress resumed.  A recent example was the US action after W.W.II when it had the foresight and resources to promote rebuilding in Asia and Europe.  He asks what would have happened had all  succumbed to reaction.  He doubts that a large-scale or universal catastrophe could happen now; he imagines that even if Europe or the US falters there will remain progressive islands in the sea of decline that will find ways forward.  He suggests that perhaps China, India, Brazil, or some other could be that island.  His conclusion: regardless of setbacks, by almost any measure our trajectory in general through time has been upward, that although the doom sayers have always been fashionable at least as far back as recorded history, in fact their predictions of final decline clearly have been wrong.<br /><br />Ridley argues that progress requires creative destruction;  culling the old and outdated while creating the new and improved.  He refers to \\"catallaxy\\"- a term coined by Hyak signifying the production of spontaneous order from the flux of change. There is a chapter in his book- \\"Catallaxy\\" in which he describes future changes that he views favorably.  For instance he predicts that large corporations, political parties and government bureaucracies will \\"crumble and fragment\\".  Small is better and more dynamic with more fluid aggregations of people .  H-D has a similar view regarding the effectiveness of relatively informal bottom-up decision-making and initiative.<br /><br />How can we choose between these narratives; or to what extent can one or another be discounted?  All three are plausible and the authors' data and interpretations are persuasive for the most part. They share many of the same concerns,  acknowledging the challenges we face: the corruption of society's institutions, political and economic dysfunction, and the need to resolve the problems of the poor and the third world.  There is no explicit contradiction between Homer-Dixon's and Ridley's positions given their different starting points- the one concerned with specific failures, the decline of Rome, the initiation of W.W.I and the resulting Nazi and Bolshevik catastrophes, in contrast to the other's focus on the overall direction of mankind's progress.  H-D views history at higher resolution and despite the general  trend, all nation-states ultimately fail.<br /><br />H-D focuses attention on governance and decision-making. and H. and H-D  see danger arising from financial and political dysfunction.  R. implicitly assumes that institutional failures that are of particular concern for H-D will be remedied by future innovators, that resolution of such problems can be expected because until now mankind  has overcome them.  But regarding man's future in the political and economic context,  the historical record is less supportive of faith in the upward trend in all but the very long term.  By making the achievements following the renaissance- the scientific and technological revolution- medicine,  agriculture,  and manufacture the major focus of his narrative,  R. has picked aspects of man's culture that would most likely feature successful behaviors; achievement should be easier in these arenas for even modestly functional societies.  H-D and Heinberg undoubtedly would agree with most of R's narrative regarding technological progress.  As for Heinberg he sees a future for which history provides little precedent because of increasing restrictions on resource supply. Thus there remains the major contradiction between Ridley's view on one side and Homer-Dixon and Heinberg's view on the other: namely the desirability and possibility of future robust economic growth.  Ridley asserts that  future economic growth is not only possible but is a moral imperative given that it is a necessary condition for continued improvement in the human condition, particularly for developing countries and the poor everywhere.<br /><br />All three authors are unpersuasive in some particulars.  From my perspective some of R's enthusiasms should be characterized as Panglossian. One quote: \\"Politicians are increasingly corks tossed on waves of public opinion\\" which he finds encouraging.  His view of voter sophistication is unsupported by most of the research of which I'm aware.  He extolls the advantages of people assembling their own news sources.  Will this further enable confirmation bias and herd-mentality?  Electronic media, the internet, etc.  exercise increasing political influence.  Has the result been better informed AND more analytic citizens employing critical thinking skills, or are we now more subject to manipulation, group think, and increasingly enabled to find support for cherished beliefs untested by exposure to alternative views encouraging comparison between one's own reality and others'?  H-D  addresses this concern.  There is increasing distrust and a rejection of many of our institutions- governmental and others including the scientific establishment.  I imagine that , one thing more counterproductive for citizens and decision-makers than uncritically accepting views of experts is to uncritically reject them.  Another difficulty with R's narrative is his focus on aggregate wealth and failure to credit wealth distribution trends.  One environmental impact he discounts is ocean acidification and resulting risk to marine biosystems, maintaining that ocean water is highly buffered and whatever the impact, the results should be mixed.  It's fair to say that most workers in this field don't agree with his ideas.<br /><br />Heinberg's  arguments concerning economic policy are compelling but his prognostication concerning resources- Peak Oil, etc. is less so; resource constraints must assuredly have an increasing impact, but the time line for such developments seems uncertain.  He doesn't convince me of it being crucial in next 20-40 years especially with technological advances in transportation, conservation, developments with renewable energy including nuclear, and extraction of natural gas.  His arguments are an example of the \\"now syndrome\\" -whatever the problem, now is \\"the turning point\\", coincidental with a book's publication.  For one glimpse of a less restricted future go the the web site:  \\"passiv haus\\".  Another difficulty for me:  he sees a return to a kind of version of the past; where more people will  sew and sow- be involved in producing the food and other goods that they require. as was the condition before the industrial age.  This is certainly counter to the view of progress as seen by Ridley.  While such basic activities should be pursued by those who find them rewarding,  hopefully there will be increasing possibility to choose one's life/work style;  that there will be even more specialization with more choices to create and recreate.  Hopefully  educational resources will be increasingly utilized to allow for personal achievement on and off the job.<br /><br />There are two issues barely noted by the three authors. They all apparently favor free markets, but given the centrality of profit and related  labor  cost,  there is an inherent conflict between the aim of maximizing citizens' economic welfare and opportunity for rewarding employment and maximizing return on capital.  Perhaps the last two hundred years has been featuring a singularity- the scarcity of skilled  labor relative to demand.  Developments in electronics and automation will result in increasing productivity in many lines of work; assuredly there will still be rewarding engagement in agriculture, resource capture and reprocessing, many service sectors- medicine, food service and sales, and  R & D,  but overall,the trend is a decreasing labor input.  What is the expectation for the size of workers'  piece of the economic pie?  The challenge will be to decouple work from maintenance of a satisfactory living standard;  our economy will only function at a high level if there are economically capable consumers.  Obviously this is a moral issue as well as one simply of supply and demand.  An observer, especially a wage-earner living through the years 1938-1970 might have a different view of inevitability of economic progress than one living through the time from the 70s until now.<br /><br />Everything considered, I believe that all three authors provide a useful bases for thinking  about our future and what we can do to make it a more rewarding one.  Heinberg's no- economic-growth scenario certainly impliess a radically new course for mankind.  For those who are inclined to a philosophical mindset  Ridley will be encouraging.  Then again if you were a small landowner in the 30s Russia,  or a Roman citizen in the year 400,  or an American laborer today you might buy Ridley's premise but nevertheless feel more doubtful about your future and \\"the future\\".  It' seems to me that H-D's analysis might be more useful for decision makers who are looking for tools to formulate possible paths into the future.

B005LAIHPY|3.0|2012 already racked up a few blockbuster box office disasters. Many times the failure to bring in the audiences and money studios expected is warranted. Other times it's a lack of promotion and unexpected disinterest in the project. One of the films I was hard on before I saw it was \\"Battleship.\\" I'm glad I got another chance to see it on Blu-ray now that it's coming out through Universal Studios Home Entertainment.<br /><br />It appeared Hasbro and Universal were just trying to cash in on the success of the \\"Transformers\\" and G.I. Joe\\" movies. Could lightning strike three times and another one of their other popular lines garner as much attention? The dismal domestic box office numbers answered that question with a loud, \\"Not in America!\\" The negative response to the film gave a whole new meaning to the famous phrase, \\"You sank my Battleship!\\"<br /><br />Naval officer Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) is assigned to the USS John Paul Jones after being forced to join the military by his older brother who also serves. When the Earth is attacked by alien forces, a fleet of battleships are sent to engage them. They must also thwart the aliens' plans to send a message to their home planet seeking reinforcements.<br /><br />Writers Jon and Erich Hoeber and director Peter Berg should be commended for at least attempting to give \\"Battleship\\" a story the audience could identify with. A couple of the characters are developed enough to where we care what happens to them. Unfortunately, most of the supporting cast is just warm bodies propped up for looks or to fire guns or push buttons.<br /><br />The visual effects and CGI in the movie look good. One of the most impressive scenes is when one of the battleships goes down. It's reminiscent of the sinking of the Titanic in James Cameron's hit; just with way more explosions. The aliens aren't the usual lizard-like type we've been seeing lately. They are humanoid and uniquely creepy.<br /><br />I feel sorry for Taylor Kitsch after seeing this movie. The guy can act and did his best in both \\"Battleship\\" and \\"John Carter.\\" The movies definitely didn't fail at the box office because of his performances. Liam Neeson is completely wasted in the film. He is onscreen a total of 15 minutes. He goes between looking like he cares and appearing indifferent. I'm not sure why Rihanna is in the movie. Why go to all the trouble to get a famous singer in your movie and then waste her character? She has hardly any lines and just blows stuff up while looking tough.<br /><br />The main problem with \\"Battleship\\" is it gets tedious. The excitement of ships shooting at each other in the water only lasts so long. A feeling of repetition hit me about an hour into the film.<br /><br />One thing I'll give the writers is credit for coming up with ingenious ways to use the different concepts from the game. The red pegs were utilized in the film as alien missiles. The crew also had to guess where the ships were in the water through eliminating areas on a visual computer graph.<br /><br />The high definition transfer of the movie is excellent. The picture is clear and the colors are vibrant. The 5.1 surround sound throws explosions and sound effects at you from all directions. They're excellently mixed with the dialogue and musical score. There are plenty of special features to get consumers excited.<br /><br />They include featurettes like \\"Preparing for Battle,\\" \\"All Hands on Deck: The Cast,\\" \\"Engage in Battle: Shooting at Sea\\" \\"All aboard the Fleet,\\" \\"The Visual Effects of 'Battleship',\\" \\"USS Missouri VIP Tour,\\" and \\"Commander Pete.\\" An alternate ending previsualization is also included. We get all access with Peter Berg as well.<br /><br />Maybe the release of \\"Battleship\\" on Blu-ray and DVD will garner the attention of people who didn't want to fork over the cash to see the movie in theaters. Hopefully, they'll give it a chance in the comfort of their own home. Now that I've seen it, I realize what a spectacle I missed onthe big screen and how unfair I was to judge a game by its box (I know, that was cheesy).the big screen and how unfair I was to judge a game by its box (I know, that was cheesy).
0345803485|1.0|Everyone was talking about this book, so I tried it out.  I WAS APPLAUDED!!!  I got through 9 chapters, went to the reviews to see if it was just me, or others too, read that it wasn't just me and threw it out.  I do not understand the S and M community, and to me this book was solely about an insecure rich kid abusing a woman and taking away from her as much free will as possible.  I found nothing romantic about the sleaze ball, and didn't like the female role who willingly agreed to beatings because this scumbag was just so 'god-like'.  Not buying any of it- found it utterly disgusting and demeaning to women.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I was very unimpressed with this book. In fact, I struggled to get halfway through it and, after some weeks of hardly reading at all because I really wasn't liking what I was reading, I gave up and started something more entertaining. It wasn't offensive or shocking, I just felt that the storyline was there only to string some \\"titillating\\" stuff together.  It will take a while before I contemplating reading any more of this author.

0316098329|4.0|I read \\"Room\\" because my rising 9th grade child was assigned to do so.  While I have a very high appreciation for the novel, I immediately questioned its appropriateness for a rising 9th grader (and rising 8th graders in our school district).  It is an adult novel.  Yes, my rising 9th grader can handle the adult conversation around this book, but I'd rather an assignment coming from the school focus on other equally good and important books.<br /><br />That said, the tenacity of the two main characters is noteworthy.  Written from the child's perspective, the novel brings a unique voice to how such a tale is told.  I appreciated having to think along with the child's voice as I read.

B005LAIHPY|5.0|My expectations were pretty low when I went in to see this, but I left very pleased. The story was easier to follow than any of the Transformers films, and I'm a sucker for summer movies that take place on or around the sea. The movie has great atmosphere, and the aliens aren't your typical bad guys. Sure, they're bad, but they also have a purpose. That's a cool twist I wasn't expecting. Overall, a fun summer ride.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|This is a good movie. It moves along and does not get boring. I think the story itself has issues convincing the viewer that this society sentencs 12 year olds to death and 74 years after this started the people are still putting up with it. But if you ignore the logic and just get into the movie it is pretty good. I know in the next movies there is an uprising but I cannot see any modern society allowing this to happen.

B0050AWMUQ|5.0|Many people may be solely aware of the album's title track thanks to deceased rocker Kurt Cobain and his performing it on Nirvana unplugged.  The album itself is Bowie's hardest rocking album in his back catalog.  To kick off the album we get the 8 minute rocker 'Width of a Circle'.  The album quickly establishes itself as quite heavier than Space Oddity.  To say the album is dark is putting it mildly. All the Madmen, Running Gun Blues, She Shook me Cold and the Supermen all flirt with themes of paranoia, post traumatic stress, sex and Nietsche.  Sound like a good time?  Well it is.  If you are a fan of early 70's metal than this should definitely be in your collection.  A bombastic album that you put on and leave on till its thru.  Take a journey with David Bowie through Black Country Rock and find perhaps a Bowie you never knew. A constant chameleon, this album captures Bowie at one of his earliest creative peaks without a clever character to sell you the album.  Great stuff, if you get the out of print Rykodisc edition you'll be treated to several extra tracks.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|i was deciding between this bag and the one from Canon for nearly the same price<br /><br />i ordered this one because it's a bit smaller and looks more decent with black color<br /><br />i was happy with what i got. still using it - for canon 7D with 50mm and 24-70mm lens + lots of accessories.
0761169253|5.0|I love reading books on creativity and have gained a lot from the books by Keri Smith. I LOVE the conciseness and simplicity of Steal Like an Artist. I immediately put many of his ideas to use, such as \\"Don't Throw Any of Yourself Away.\\" I felt re-affirmed with his suggestion, \\"Step Away From the Screen.\\" I have been doing this for the past year, \\"creating\\" on my analog desk with pens, papers, colors, various materials, and product mockups--and then moving the ideas to my digital station to refine them.<br /><br />After reading this book, I took down a lot of stuff from my huge bulletin board. Much of the material had been up so long that it all seemed dead, but in case I should change my mind, I put the items in a \\"Bulletin Board\\" folder so I'm not throwing any of myself away. I'm having so much fun playing with a lot of the new items on my bulletin board.<br /><br />I was also re-affirmed with his thought, \\"Don't Worry About Unity From Piece to Piece--What unifies all of your work is the fact that you made it.\\" Already, I'm incorporating ideas from the inspirational anthologies I compile into inspirational gift products. And a children's picture book is making its way toward a screenplay.<br /><br />A crucial point is a quote from Steve Jobs: \\"You can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards.\\"<br /><br />I'm thrilled to see that Steal Like an Artist made the NYT bestseller list! It well deserves it and I look forward to Austin Kleon's next book.

B001HBAPC4|1.0|I had been wanting the dark knight movie for awhile. I found it on amazon and saw that it was the one that had the slip cover that goes over the blu ray the inequality that i wanted so i bought it. Now it said it was the blu ray two disc special edition and came with the digital copy. Well when i got the movie it didn't have the slip cover the package was open when it said it was brand new. There was only the blu ray and no digital copy when i contacted the seller they told me that there not goin to give me a replacement one the right one that i paid for. I contacted amazon and they did the a to z form and they gave me my money back so i would rate this not even one star

B008AWBQGW|2.0|After listening to this album and trying to convince myself that it's good, I just can't. It feels incredibly forced. It seems that the band is trying way to hard to appeal to the rowdy, beer drinkin, bar fightin country crowd. They do a good job of that, but that's not what Skynyrd is about. A couple of the songs are of pretty good quality with \\"Ready To Fly\\" being the best of the bunch and the title track not too far behind.<br /><br />The music on the album is right in line with the other output of the \\"post crash\\" Skynyrd, but leaning a little on the country side. The RVZ led lineups could toe that line between Hard Rock and Country perfectly, but that's a quality that this lineup can't seem to achieve. The lyrical content on many tracks is trying to be deep and meaningful and it just comes off as rather cheesy. When the lyrics are not meant to be deep and just rock they come off as hokie as can be. Songs about the tough times and working hard, callouses on the hands and it just comes off as amateurish at times.<br /><br />I really think it's just about time for Skynyrd to be put to bed for good. If this band wants to keep on touring and recording albums, fine, but it just shouldn't have the Skynyrd name attached to it. With Gary Rossington being the only \\"pre crash\\" member left, it just doesn't feel the same. When Billy Powell and Leon Wilkeson were still alive it at least felt like Skynyrd beings there were three originals.<br /><br />Bottom line is the album is not bad, but it's really not that good either. If you like modern country that leans a little towards the harder side, then this album is for you. If you like the \\"classic\\" Skynyrd sound, this ain't it. If you really want to listen to \\"new\\" Skynyrd, stick with \\"Vicious Cycle\\". It is a far superior album.

B0058YPL66|5.0|Itinerant bounty huntress Emma Swann had just wrapped up bagging a bail jumper in Boston on her birthday when the son she gave up for adoption as a teen mom shows up on her doorstep to tell her that the central Maine backwater town he lives in is populated by all the fairy tale characters we've grown up reading about as kids, transported there from a parallel universe out of sheer spite by his stepmother/town mayor the Evil Queen, and only Emma--who is the long-lost daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming--can restore everything to what it was.<br /><br />The fun of this show is rooted in both how all those fairy tale characters are fitted into our world (Cinderella as a teen mom, Little Red Riding Hood as a rebellious and vixenish diner waitress, Rumplestilskin as the richest guy in town) but also how those characters came to be with new and interesting twists on their backstories, such as a reworking of [[ASIN:B003DZX3SA Beauty and the Beast]] to give Rumplestilskin more depth of character, or the exact reasons behind the Evil Queen's vendetta against Snow White, why Prince Charming is called \\"Prince Charming,\\" and even a surprise angle on Little Red Riding Hood you would never have considered.  Plus the [[ASIN:B004KPLVV8 Tron]] that occasionally pop up are good for a laugh.  It can drag a little, but it definitely keeps you locked in all the way through.
030758836X|2.0|Gone Girl was recommended to me by the clerk at a local bookstore, who saw me stocking up on Stephen King and Philip K. Dick and vehemently insisted that if I like \\"those kinds\\" of novels, I would love this one. She really talked it up -- the intriguing mystery, the sociopath character study, the shocking twists and turns; she even went so far as to call it \\"the most f___d up book\\" she had read in a long time. Sold.<br /><br />Listening to her was my first mistake. I had just finished reading King's Misery, one of the books I picked up at the same time (now there's a real sociopath character study), and I couldn't wait to get started on this one. Finishing the book, despite my instincts, was the second mistake. It was then that I accepted that I had been had, both by the clerk and the author. The story goes like this: Nick and Amy Dunne's marriage is on the rocks. From finances to romance, there's trouble everywhere. On the morning of their fifth anniversary, Amy goes missing, and signs point to Nick. As the police and public are closing in, Nick insists he is innocent, but who are we to believe, and look out for that plot twist! and blah... blah... blah.<br /><br />Cliche to be sure, but at the risk of sounding bitter, let me just say that the first part of the novel starts magnificently -- so much so that it's enough to believe, to hope, to pray that you won't be let down. The first part focuses on Nick and the peeling away of his rotten layers as the conflict fully develops. In this first section, the characters are fascinating, the imagery is rich (the taste of bile in Nick's throat, the sun pointing an accusatory ray-finger), and the story is believable. During part one, Flynn succeeds at getting the reader to accept what she wants them to, and it makes for an engrossing start. Thank you, savvy bookstore clerk!<br /><br />And then comes part two. And three. And this is where the entire thing falls apart. The old bait and switcheroo. Reading Gone Girl is akin towatching some blockbuster movie that all your dim-witted neighbors just adored, only to find yourself sitting in the theater feeling completely cheated. By the second half of the book, everything that made the first half great has now grown tired -- the characters and their preposterous actions are more and more banal, the imagery takes a backseat to boring dialogue, and the plot development becomes less believable. It's not a page-turner. It's not gripping to the point that you can't put it down. You only want to finish to just see if you're right, that it will indeed end disappointingly. And despite the hopeful start, Flynn backs herself into a corner and is unable to write herself out, leaving the reader with a ridiculous, predictable, and unsatisfying ending that leaves much to be desired. And believe me, I \\"get\\" the ending -- I get the greater comment it's making, I get the absurdity of it all, I get the point, I get that there could be a sequel, I get it; it's just glaringly obvious and terribly boring.<br /><br />So, a great start, moments of clarity, but overall truly disappointing. Typical bestseller rubbish. Like my movie analogy earlier, I have no doubt that there are plenty of bored, obtuse people that will find Gone Girl absolutely thrilling -- I can imagine a number of people in my life who will think this is the greatest drama ever played out on the page -- but then again, people like a lot of stuff. Like monster trucks. Or Applebees.<br /><br />And to think, that same clerk had the audacity to say, \\"And if you like this -- be sure to check out Dostoyevsky!\\" Uh, yeah, thanks.

B005OV1MX4|5.0|Amazon often aggregates reviews in a wrong way. Depending on what production you are viewing, here are my reviews:  (Wiener Staatsoper, Zubin Metha). 5 stars. I must disagree with the previous reviewers! OK, there are often strange elements in today's staging of operas. Opera audiences have to live some curious and often annoying conceptions of stage directors. But this production isn't bad! The singers are really world class, and they both sing and act well. Apart form the scene featuring cowboys and indians, I think that the production is coherent and well staged, not least the set design. Picture and sound is beyond praise, as is the playing of the Vienna State Opera Orchestra under the direction of Zubin Metha. To give this disc only one star is a depreciation. My wife and I enjoyed it a lot.  (Teatro Regio di Parma, Gianluigi Gelmetti): 4 stars. Even though the first scene is very dark (black clothing, black scenery), and the sets are modern and austere, I quite liked the production. The mass scenes and the dancers are excellent. The singers are generally good, but no more. I liked Roberto Scandiuzzi (Padre Guardiano) best. He has a strong deep bass voice, Vladimir Stoyanov (Don Carlo) is also good, but I've heard better performed &#34;Urna fatale&#34;s. Aquiles Machado (Don Alvaro) may be a fine tenor, but his voice seems somewhat sharp and uncomfortable. This may be due to the recording, which is dry and lacks ambience. Dimitra Theodossiou (Donna Leonora) does her job OK, but I sometimes found her vibrato too emphasized. Not my favotite Leonora. Marina Pentcheva (Preziosilla) is definetely too wobbly.

030758836X|2.0|The first half of the book was well-written and engrossing. It reeled you in as promised. The second half began well, building on the first and still beckoning you on. But, the last quarter of the book became offensively histrionic, even hysterical. The ending itself was...just stupid. It went from suspenseful thriller to Ladies Home Journal social commentary. So, after staying up too late 3 nights in a row to finish it, in the end, I felt I had wasted my time.
B000FCKIFU|3.0|I have been trying to read the book on an Android Kindle app and it's giving me fits! When I touch the screen to go forward or back or to bring up the options it might do the expected, or it might just jump to the index! Then I have to figure out where I was and navigate back to that page and then wonder what will happen the next time I touch the screen!
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Joyless, predictable, and silly!  A rehash of what's come before in different forms from comic books, movies, television, and even video games etc. THE HUNGER GAMES is depressing and not fun to watch. This reviewer just didn't care for any of the characters either. Just put on the superior THE RUNNING MAN with Arnold Schwarzenegger and enjoy the ride.  At least there's humor without a bunch of whiney brat-packers running around, and it doesn't take itself too seriously!
B008XCF7Y6|5.0|Amazing!!!!<br />This should have been made into the real movie. The best CGI film Ive ever seen with an actual noteworthy plot, characters, guns, ships, and bugs bugs bugs!!! All the gore and nudity you can expect from a SST film buy this, its that good!

0374275637|5.0|Nudge, Blink, The Invisible Gorilla, Redirect - if you liked any of these books, you'll like this one.<br /><br />Aside from sheer quantity and quality of information, this book exceeds others by disseminating information without raging about others (well maybe econs and stock-traders get a hard time but they deserve it!)<br /><br />While heavy going at times, this book is entirely worth the effort (and easier than an entire psyc degree)

I would like to buy a Blu-ray DVD of it to update my collection but living in New Zealand, it would have to be a Region or Zone free one, American Zoned Blu Ray DVDs don't work on our Blu-Ray DVD players. This film is not available in New Zealand and is not on any one's future release lists here.<br /><br />John D

1603429999|5.0|I have been knitting for over 45 years and figured I knew it all, but this book had some great tips and techniques I had forgotten about.  The format is easy to follow and the pictures and illustrations are super helpful.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First off, I am not going to beat a dead horse on how badly written this is. That is a matter of perspective and honestly as an author myself, I don't feel right in mocking another authors abilities.<br /><br />But I am going to approach this from a different angle. This series and its success disturbs me. 1st from the perspective of someone who is in the lifestyle, this book is a horrible misrepresentation of BDSM.<br /><br />James did no research whatsoever here and all you need to know that is the fact zip ties are used. Zip ties can cut off circulation and cause scarring and permanent injury. There is a reason terrorists use them. Secondly? It sounds funny, but is a good point. No Dom worth his salt would allow Ana to say \\"down there\\" they would be making her say a much vulgar word over and over and over again. To him, to strangers in a club. She would be denied bathroom privileges until she said it. Sounds rough, but all in the game.<br /><br />Christian Gray is not a dominant or a master. He is a petulant spoiled child, but worse a domineering bully and an abusive man. This frightens me. In the BDSM community this book is reviled for this reason and if I had a dollar for every true member of the community who said \\"I hope any girl reading this never meets a real Gray\\" I'd be retired.<br /><br />Ana disturbs me. She is nothing short of pathetic and so needy and naive and willing to be abused by this man she sets the woman's rights movement back 50 years. She should have a copy of the \\"Housewives\\" handbook with her.<br /><br />I find it truly frightening that millions of women are glorifying this abusive thug. I realize this is fiction, but this book is being touted to the point it really is pushing abusive behavior and telling women its okay, cause he is really a nice guy somewhere in there. That is not true. Men like Gray do not change and those relationships end in pain and sometimes worse.<br /><br />This book makes light of that. There is nothing in Gray that resembles a true BDSM dominant and Ana is not a sub, but a victim.<br /><br />I will conclude with commenting on the sex. \\"Bondage\\" does not equate BDSM and his playroom is a joke. The sex is repetitive and flat out boring. I find it amazing this book is still selling so well with now barely a 3 rating and almost as many one reviews as fives. Then again I never remember a book being shoved so far down people's throats either.<br /><br />I do not recommend this book to anyone and if you see a young coed reading it, take it away from her. You'll be saving her a restraining order further down.
0316017930|4.0|I cannot but replicate 'The Times' note on the book cover, this book was really revelatory, from the history of success of men of great renown to how a certain cultural substratum is at odd with another in terms of communicating apparently simple instructions. Then the very first chapters about athletics skills and birth dates is a must! In the end those birth dates are really something to think about, seems like that 'carpe diem' and success have a lot of things in common.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|when I can use this app, it is wonderful! but it has to have wi-fi in order to use it. if it didn't require wi-fi it would be perfect and I could actually bring it to church.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|The transfer of the Amélie Blu-ray is jaw dropping.  Don't let the modest price fool you, the domestic release from Lionsgate is everything you could ever want in a Blu-ray.  The overall greatness of the film aside, this release will let you re-live what you thought you had already seen.  Colors burst out at you in every scene and the soundtrack is incredible.  I owned the DVD years ago and it looked amazing then too.  However, the blu-ray release made something great even better.  You need this in your collection.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a vibrant adventure that left me exulted and exhausted.  The story captured me immediately, and I was tears within the first half hour. Maybe I have not read enough of Stephen King's books to realize his skill with pathos or perhaps it is newly learned, but he has perfected it. He \\"nods\\" to his new baby granddaughter Zelda in the afterword and his care for her is evident in the sensitive descriptions of all the little girls  throughout: Princess Summerfall Winterspring, baby June, jump roping Sadie, Bevvie-from-the-levee, and Rosette with her Crayola girls.<br /><br />The amount of research that was done is evident in the descriptions and texture of the story. The book is extremely long (852 pages!) but necessary to encompass the magnitude of the plot.<br />I would not change a thing to this epic story, and enjoyed it beyond measure.
B0073XV2W2|3.0|Overall I liked the book and it's a fast read.  The single thing that I came away with was the fear factor never built like it did in Daemon.  This book seems to get too mired in the details of the technology of the drones that it never really builds that fear factor of the drones by ordinary citizens.  There's never a feeling of despair that the drone problem is getting out of control.  I would have liked to see more of the ordinary citizen feel to the book.  The characters are fairly shallow and not really developed much, especially the antagonists.  The ending really doesn't leave you understanding who's behind the drones.  A good book, but not great.  Expected more from the author.
B007BZM30M|1.0|I wish I could give this song negative stars. Me ranting doesn't even begin to describe how god awful this \\"song\\" is. It is SO repetitive, the fake violin in the background of the chorus is unbearable to take after the 50th time you hear the chorus. When I first heard this song(well actually I saw the music video on Fuse), I thought to myself, 'Please god, let 2012 be real'. Because if this is what music has deteriorated to, then god save us all. I don't understand how so many people can think this is a \\"cute\\" or \\"fun\\" song, it seriously scares me to think that this is what music is accepted as. I'm 18, and long-live the genres that are made with actual instruments, not auto-tuned little girls.
B000VWKJFS|5.0|This album is from what I consider the best age of Elton John... I am a real fan of his early stuff (up through Captain Fantastic) and find this album to really shine from the Elton/Bernie Taupin era when they were really cranking out great music. This album has some great deep cuts besides \\"The Bitch is Back\\", songs like Dixie Lily could have easily been on Tumbleweed Connection, but are an interesting break here... The nonsense song \\"Sola Prestige a Gammon\\" is interesting, but one of the real gems is \\"Ticking\\"... Definitely one of his better early works!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I love how E.L. James brings the story to a close. Book three is not as great as one and two, but well worth the read. Will wait patiently for more.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have an iPhone 4 with an Otterbox Defender case on it and this fits perfectly in the opening. I have both an iHome and an off brand dock and they both work wonderfully with this adapter. Someone said they didn't support charging on their dock (don't remember who), but mine works fine as long as the dock was made for iPhone. My off brand dock is older (from before iPhones) and it still charged my phone. Someone also said it's a little flimsy, but when your giant Otterbox covered phone is sitting an inch in the air without any support, it's to be expected. I found that it works fine and as long as I'm not constantly touching my phone or moving the dock, the iPhone stays on fine all night. I have not tried it with any of my other cases, but they have about the same or larger dock openings so I'm not worried about them.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't seem stop reading this book over and over again. The details are great and very well written. E.L. James is a great writer and I can't wait to read more of her books. A definite page-turner and highly recommended.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|I'd say that this film, a sequel to the \\"Clash of the Titans,\\" starring Aussie Sam Worthington as Perseus, bastard son of Zeus & a half-god, is competant action/fantasy.  Not stellar, as compared to Lord of the Rings, but engaging.  Fills in a lot of holes in the original stories of the Greek Gods with some creative writing.  But the \\"I'm your father, he's your brother, he's your son\\" line does get pretty tiring after a while.  It seems as though that's the main emotional catch that the writers use to try to get the viewers interested in these capricious, violent gods and their ever-shifting allegiances.  That, and the certain destruction of the world by some nasty super-gods (Kronos, held captive in the Underworld.  He looks kind of like the Balrog in Lord of the Rings).<br /><br />By the end of the movie, you're saying, \\"OK I get it!  Be loyal to your Brother!  Be thankful of your Father!  Always love your Son!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!\\"  The wife of Perseus conveniently died, so the whole family thing is pretty much confined to the males.  Hades, brother of Zeus (Liam Neeson), double-crosses him in order to free THEIR father, Kronos, from the Tartarus prison in the Underworld, until Hades (Ralph Fiennes) repents and becomes loyal to HIS brother again.  And then Perseus' half-brother, Ares, fights Perseus and likewise double-crosses Zeus, HIS father, until Perseus is helped by Helius, HIS son, to fight Ares the half-brother and free Zeus the father so that their Grand-father, Kronos, doesn't escape and destroy the world.  Get it?  And throw in Agenor, the son of Poseidon, cousin of Perseus, and you have some even more father/son/cousin/brother combinations going on there.  The only relief from all this hairy male familial angst is Rosamund Pike as Andromeda, who thankfully provides some female eye-candy, albeit the swaggering soldiering type.<br /><br />The movie does actually provide some engaging fantasy scenes, particularly when Perseus, Andromeda and Agenor (\\"the navigator\\") have to navigate the labyrinth.  Also when they fight some realistic-looking Cyclopses.  And of course, much similar to Perseus fighting the Kraken in the original, is the final scene in which Kronos comes out and threatens humanity.  (Hint: it involves Perseus on the Black Pegasus again!)  So it's entertaining, and you do wonder if/when our macho Aussie Perseus is going to fall for the lovely Andromeda (and if he's going to clean up all his blood & sweat before kissing her!).

Whether good or badly written, i think they all are beneficial to read.<br />Generally, any self-help book, business or otherwise, i read to 1)get ideas 2)to become motivated  3)to learn, not of whats possible, but to learn small steps here and there, to steal and to get my creative juices going.<br /><br />This book tells you about a-lot of stories, but it doesn't really tell you how the people have done, the obstacles, the steps they've had to take to even start these succesfull business.  By half of it i was just skimming through the pages.<br /><br />Not the worse but far from the best
B006MVJ2L4|4.0|Catchy: Cuckoo, Shady, Trespassing, BTIKM, NCOE, Map, Chokehold, Pop that lock<br />Emo: Outlaws of love, Underneath, Broken English, Nirvana, Runnin, Take back<br />Yikes: Kickin in, Naked love, By the rules<br />I loved Cuckoo, Outlaws of love, Shady, BTIKM, Map, etc.<br />I didnt get Kickin in and Naked love at all. They are meaningless to me.<br />Rest of the songs are listenable, sticking to the FYE style, pop/dance/rock, emotional/howling. But FYE was listenable in its entirety, but on Trespassing, I always end up skipping Kickin in and Naked love, and sometimes By the rules.<br />All in all, value for money for Glamberts (including me).<br />Nothing exceptional on this album to attract non-glamberts.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|The English Patient is visually gorgeous and unforgettably tragic. Ralph Fiennes portrays a Hungarian nobleman who has lost his memory as the result of an airplane crash while transporting the body of his beloved Catherine Clifton to...God knows where. He is a survivor of a mapmaking expedition into the Sahara just before World War II, and he and the married Catherine fall in love with each other against their better judgment. Her husband attempts to kill them both by crashing his plane; only Catherine survives to die in a cave while her lover is gone in search of help.<br /><br />In few words, Fiennes if elegant and desperate as Count Almasy, and Kristen Scott Thomas as Catherine is at first elegant and cool, then wonderfully passionate. Colin Firth is suppressed and furious as the betrayed husband, and Juliette Binoche is the Canadian Army nurse who cares for Fiennes in his final days of loss and recovery via flashbacks. And there is Willem Dafoe as a vengeful and agonized thief who lost his thumbs because the Count betrayed war secrets to the German in exchange for a biplane to get him back to Catherine.<br /><br />Okay, I've dropped plot spoilers. What I have NOT given away are the scenic views of the desert and the incredible music of Gabriel Yared's musical score, which is luscious. Anthony Minghella was one of the great directors who got the best from everyone involved. Fiennes, particularly, deservedly remembered for Amon Goeth, the fiendish commander of the Plaszow slave labor camp in Schindler's List, here performs as a romantic but never mawkish Count Almasy. His eyes and voice sears the memory.
B007IUBU86|5.0|this is a kick a s s album hard throttling killer metal album excellent for those of us so tired of this pop s h i t that dominates the popular airwaves.  good ballads too .pick me up after a hard days work. omerta on pop. i declare vendetta on pop and most modern hiphop rap. a cool tour would be adrenaline mob and lamb of god. since when did most of america becomes p u s s i e s i like uncle ted and alot of true rockers and metal enthusiasts am a patriot just like my forefathers and heroes . america was discovered by vikings and brittish and irish whats more metal than that.rock on patriots unite.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Because books are always better than movies.  And this movie was absolutely great,  The acting was top notch, and to see acting royalty like Cicely Tyson and Sissy Spaseck take relatively small parts, says a lot about just how good this movie is.  The story is rich and complex.  It takes a very awful situation, segregation, and shows how there were sometimes real bonds between the white people and the black people!  It's good to see that at least a few of the white people come off as decent!<br /><br />And while I can't condone the black woman who served doo-doo pie, I can't really blame her!  As an abused, disabled, woman, of low income I tend to identify with others who are also downtrodden!  You see, those of us who are persecuted tend not to like our persecutors!
B0008ENHUI|4.0|This film is well made,great location scenery,though somewhat disturbing also,Steve Mcqueen who plays Papillon, goes through tremedous hell,making things worse is the fact, that Papillon is really innocent,he must endure starvation,islolation,and maybe even worse..the fact he realizes through halluicnation dream that his life was wasted,this is a point in the movie that makes a person take notice,don,t waste your life,however the character is not totally a (waste) as Mcqueen,s character demonstrates his resilents,peresistence, and human spirit,despite the odds,that brings him and co-star Dustin Hoffman to somewhat epic ending.
0345803493|5.0|I read to escape into different worlds and this book is definitely on a different planet from my typical reads. However, I fell in the love with the characters and the story continually moves along and keeps you guessing. The sex was a bit excessive in parts, but overall I would say that the plot and characters held the storyline together and made me rush out to buy Fifty Shades of Freed. I was pleasantly surprised by this trilogy.
B004LROMWU|4.0|Other reviewers have covered a wish for more action, though most agree the writing and special effects are good, and the subdued presentation is in keeping with the premise that unspectacular \\"average folk\\" are forced to resist alien invasion or simply accept extermination.  But Season 2 really takes off with plot points I should not spoil here, and has enough of a solid audience that TNT has ordered Season 3 to be made.<br /><br />So yes, buy Season 1 now, add Season 2 to it when it is finally released on DVD (broadcast tv showed the season 2 finale just a week ago)and collect a very worthwhile sci-fi series.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I also ordered this movie for my father as a gift (as he loves movies). I ordered this movie on a Friday and recieved it on a Monday, so the shipping time as standard I was extremely impressed with. The movie was nicely packaged and brand new, so no damage. I was also extremely amazed at the price of this movie, so of course I had to order it. I also got an extended edition of this movie, for the great price, which places like Walmart or others don't offer, so I was extremely happy. Thank you! I will surely come back and order again!
B00003CXAA|1.0|This product is simply amazing!! the only problem is it is severely overpriced, we\\"re talking 250% mark-up overpriced.<br />I use to own this exact Godfather collection a few years ago until my sister lost all the movies. I then bought the Blu Ray Coppola collection from best buy. I spent about $35 the first time i bought this collection and the blu ray is valued at $57, without tax, brand new.<br />I hate to see people getting ripped off, my advice is to shop around instead of buying the first item you see, save that extra couple bucks and buy some more classics!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read all three of the 50 Shades books - they were spellbinding!  I couldn't stop reading.  I haven't read a book in years, but finished all three of these in no time!  Great reading and attention keeper.
B00280LYHS|5.0|totally stinking awesome! love the books. i especially like the flying pig. i can just imagine the whole book. better to get it on kindle than at a bookstore. it is definitely worth the price. everyone will love it. much more adventurous than the other Percy Jackson series except maybe The Battle of the Labyrinth. both of them are the same. presently I am waiting for the Mark of Athena
B00846REIS|5.0|Totally loved this book and its so hard to wait for the second one. I am a HUGE fan of the 50 shades series and well SYlvia Day is holding right up to that.  Great read and great story!! hope there will be more after the next release!!!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Make sure you clean all prints off of your phone before you put this case on!<br />I love these cases! After purchasing an otter box and the rubber getting loose on our iPad and phones we wanted something better! This is it! I have dropped my phone many times and my mom uses hers in the pool all the time with no problems!
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|Honestly i do not get scared by anything and therefore my expectations were not for something that would make me scream like a little girl, which it seems is what some people have intended to find. We are no longer children and therefore do not fear like we used to and those who expect this are foolish. This show is original and tasteful and i love everything about it. I have never seen a show like this in my life and i am honored that it would come by in my generation. I am 19 years old and would recommend this show to anyone who is in the mood for some unique eye-candy. Each actor and actress surprised me and i fell in love with them all. A story concept like this does not come around often and the fact that the setting changes every season is even better. This concept has been used by shows that are fluid with who you see on television but i have rarely seen it done with a show that has a true plot line that deepens throughout. It gives the audience a chance to envision new elements of horror from different themes. I applaud FX for green lighting the show, the directors who have done so well with Glee and Niptuck, the actors who truly immerse themselves in their roles, the set designers, makeup artists, editors, and all those many many others responsible for creating such a dramatic and eery appearing show that has won my heart.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|awesome.games are free as we'll as fun.  well worth downloading and playing hours of fun for all ages. great product
034580404X|5.0|I had heard a lot of bad reviews on this book before I read them. My best friend actually convinced me that they weren't what people were saying. I went in knowing that it was going to get a little kinky, but I kept an open mind. I am SO glad I did! It's a love story! And such a great one! The author keeps you wanting to know more and more of their background and what makes Christian Grey the way he is. I won't give anything away, but I couldn't put the books down. I read the entire trilogy in 4 days, then I missed the characters so much, I turned around and read them a second time! I love them! Can't wait until the movie comes out!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|It is a really fun game. If you like Where Is My Water, you will like this too. The Phineas and Ferb tie in makes it more fun if you know the show, but it is a good game on it's own too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the different versions available and the devotionals offered! I use. this everyday on my kindle and iphone. its become part of my daily time in the word.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Mars and monsters on the cover. I wasn't really expecting much. But I'm surprised at how much I loved this movie! Action, romance, surprise twists! This is a keeper!
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game...inbetween searching the web and reading on my kindle I love to pull up a kick game of solitaire..always relaxing easy and fun!
0345803485|1.0|There are times when I finish a book even if it is not very good.  Twice in my life I have stopped reading the book because it is so bad.  This is one of those times.  So badly written the editor should be fired.  If I didn't believe it was my own fault for buying the book, I would want my money back.  Don't believe the hype.  This book is really bad. One star is about ten too many.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its collude are gorgeous. and its faboo plus it has everything a battery thingummy should it tells u what ive wasted ur time doing Wichita j think is cool
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I simply love this app! It helps me keep focused on the Word using a daily reading plan. Even when I get side tracked, I can use the &quot;catch me up&quot; function. It doesn't bother me that it's always running, for me, I think it should be!
145162445X|5.0|If you like science in general, especially physics, there's a lot of good reading here. Saw the author on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart pimping this book, glad I got it.
B00003CWTI|5.0|In my opinion this is a great film; a must see for true movie fanatics! From the opening narration, the movie explores the possibility of how lives interact and often without the connection being recognized. This movie has great acting, tumultuous relationships and phrases that are still embedded in my brain (\\"you might be done with the past, but the past is not done with you\\"). This film may not be for everyone but anyone who enjoys film, true cinematography should appreciate the art that is this film.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game to waste time with. not to easy not too hard.<br />wont beat entire game in one sitting. recommend to others.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I thought this app would be good for roadtrips that you have no wifi on and you could save your videos to your kindle fire. well you can't. and that's why I  give it 1 star. its good for something if you don't have an Internet option, but most of us do. and that's also why I uninstalled. so don't download this app because it ducks.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it tells you everything you need to know, how long you can play 2d games,3d games when you should charge next... just get it!
B0088O11NU|1.0|this game is glitchy and hard 2 control sucks and anyone who gets it will feel the same way a waste of space on memory
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addicting game, I play it everyday and complete at least 10 rounds! It gives my brain a workout, I usually get puzzled by these things but this app is just Awesome!
140053271X|2.0|This is an easy-to-use basic ebook reader.  My wife especially likes it because of its simplicity of operation.  However, right now it is totally frozen.  I cannot turn it on or off.  This is not the first time either.  We have had it refuse to connect to wi-fi before and had it freeze up before.  I will take it in to a Barnes and Noble store when I get the chance, however that is about a 2 1/2 hour trip for me.  What I have been told is that software upgrades are often buggy and create these types of issues.  It seems oftentimes when they have buggy upgrades it then takes several days or weeks to fix them.  While I like the Nook when it works it gets frustrating to deal with the issues.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great remote control app. I use it on my phone for whenever i need to get something I left on my pc. Great for forgetful folks like myself. I even use it to walk my wife through computer problems.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think this is the best stratagy game, I've ever played. I love the whole city building concept, and watching all the little trucks and buses driving around the city.

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is funnn i love playing it and the only time it ever does glich is when i have little enternet so maybe thats the prob with thos people! thanks for creating this game its my fav. :p
0345803485|5.0|OK PEOPLE LET'S GET A GRIP.... THIS BOOK IS CLEARLY FICTION!  YES, IT IS PROBABLY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT AT THE AGE OF 26 CHRISTIAN IS A BILLIONAIRE THAT CAN DO WHATEVER HE FEELS BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE. I FEEL THIS BOOK IS GETTING THE WRONG REP ON AMAZON (BY PEOPLE WHO ONLY READ PORTIONS OF THE BOOK) BECAUSE THE AUTHOR (WHO DID A GREAT JOB BY THE WAY) USED SOME WORDS REPEATEDLY. I AM AN EDUCATED WOMAN WHO READS ON A REGULAR BASICS AND I HAD NO PROBLEMS FOLLOWING THE REASONS FOR THE REPEATED WORDS. I ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT ANA OFTEN SPOKE TO HERSELF OR IN HER MIND. THEN THERE IS THE FACT THAT SOME THINK THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A WOMAN OF 21 TO BE SUCH AN INNOCENT (BECAUSE I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS THAT INNOCENT)!!! I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MOST BUT FOR ME AND MY BOOK CLUB (MY FRIENDS) WE ARE READING THESE BOOKS AS A CHANGE FROM THE NORM..... AN ESCAPE FROM REALITY.<br /><br />NEXT IS THIS RIDICULOUSNESS ABOUT ABUSE.... I KNOW FIRST HAND WHAT ABUSE IS AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE (FIFTY SHADES OF GRAY ISN'T IT)<br /><br />ABUSE IS<br /><br />1. to use wrongly or improperly; misuse: to abuse one's authority.<br />2. to treat in a harmful, injurious, or offensive way:<br />3. to speak insultingly, harshly, and unjustly to or about; revile; malign.<br />4. to commit sexual assault upon.<br />5. Obsolete . to deceive or mislead.<br /><br />SO WITH THAT BEING SAID THERE WAS NO ABUSE, HE TOLD HER EVERYTHING ABOUT THE TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP HE WAS LOOKING FOR, SHE THEN MADE A DECISION, A CHOICE AND IT'S WRONG FOR PEOPLE TO USE \\"ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP\\" WHEN TALKING AND ANA AND CHRISTIAN'S RELATIONSHIP!!!  THIS REALLY BOTHERS ME BECAUSE I WATCH MY MOM BEING ABUSED REPEATEDLY OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS... AND SHE WAS NEVER ASKED HER PERMISSION, OR PAMPERED, TAKEN CARE OF OR PROTECTED IN THE WAYS ANA WAS..... BUT LIKE I SAID BEFORE THIS IS ONLY FICTION!!!!!!!!<br /><br />ANYWAY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPEN MINDS I LOVED THIS BOOK, I LOVED THIS TRILOGY. IT REALLY IS A GREAT READ (MUST READ ALL THREE) AND IT WILL TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY! THE AMOUNT OF HURT, CONFUSION, LOVE AND ATTRACTION BETWEEN THESE TWO IS PALPABLE! IT'S EARTH SHATTERING!!<br /><br />I'LL LEAVE YOU LADIES WITH ONE QUESTION (AFTER YOU'VE READ THIS BOOK)<br /><br />WOULD YOU SIGN THE CONTRACT?????D IT WILL TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY! THE AMOUNT OF HURT, CONFUSION, LOVE AND ATTRACTION BETWEEN THESE TWO IS PALPABLE! IT'S EARTH SHATTERING!!<br /><br />I'LL LEAVE YOU LADIES WITH ONE QUESTION (AFTER YOU'VE READ THIS BOOK)<br /><br />WOULD YOU SIGN THE CONTRACT?????
B007KZY1YY|5.0|This is the first time I have reviewed a book so bare with me. I loved reading Fifty Shades Darker, I endulged my liking for LBP (lady book porn as I like to call it) and finished in two days. I was so envolved in the love story that was unfolding between Chistian and Ana I almost forgot it was fiction. EL James has certainly honed her writing skills between Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker which is reflected in the fleshed out characters and a deeper look into why Christian is the way he is. Ana is evolving and it was good to see that she now has more depth than we first thought. I do believe I will be reading this book for a third time just to relive the love and oh yeah the white hot sex!! EL James -please make me a happy lady and keep writing LBP.
B005H9B44A|2.0|Too much emphasis on action scenes and no real acting done for the actual story line. Saturday morning cartoons have done a better job.
B00722ZIBA|2.0|Wow, I truly love Incognito, however, while I enjoyed some of the music on this lastest offering, I found the cuts to be short in duration and rather bland.  I suppose that the shortness wasn't so bad because I had less time to listen to the uninspiring lyrics.  It was great to hear Maysa singing because I love her voice, unfortunaely her superb vocal skills weren't enough to redeem this project for me. Unlike the songs and music on the other eight or so albums that I have from this group, NONE of this CD's songs stood out for me.  I wish that I'd have brought another of their albums.  I'm really glad that I only paid for a used copy at a reduced price.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its so great. I love it. omg. this is such a good app. I don't know what I would do without it.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I have, actually, really enjoyed this app. Then today, I opened it to work a puzzle & all the packs I recently downloaded, including the one I paid for (thank goodness I didn't pay for more than the one) were gone. I noticed some changes but I didn't start a puzzle so I don't know about all the changes. This is the second time there was an update & I lost my downloads. I never had a rotating problem because I figured the orientation was correct to start with because rotating wasn't possible. I wish the puzzles had contrasting backgrounds, sometimes the pieces are almost impossible to see. And the carousel where the unused pieces are stored is sometimes difficult to use. And once the frame is constructed, I think it should be anchored to the background instead of moving around every time it is touched.
1419703692|5.0|Recieved this wonderful book today on time and in excellent condition.<br />This is a must own for any fan of the batman or his movies,Or a fan of<br />Great Film making period.Amazing and should be a part of every true Fans Library.
143911000X|5.0|Yes, I am a girl. I bought this for my guy friend and he loved it.  I also read it before handing it over.  It is hilarious.  I clearly heard Barney's voice inside my head as I learned the Bro code.  Definitely gained some props with this gift.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Looking a for a new book to read and I stumbled across this book. I fell in love with the book the moment I started reading it. It really is a must read. Don't hesitate just buy it because you won't want to put it down after the first chapter. I love how the characters are developed and how the book just kept unfolding more secrets.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this is a much better version of angry birds. shows wear you will go before you go knew bird. upgraded powers. awasome.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I wasn't sure because the description of the book didn't sound amazing. Without a doubt it was an amazing book and I highly recommend it. This book was an emotional rollercoaster with lots of highs and lows but you fall in love with the characters immediately. You must read this book, you won't be disappointed!
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|Great cast, I also liked the cinematography. Im suprised that this movie is not better known. Great movie, I definitely recommend it.
B00846REIS|5.0|Move over Fifty Shades of Gray there is a new man in town! I loved this book and I am counting down the days till book 2. At first this was a hard book for me to get into but once it got rolling I could not put it down after the 2nd chapter. If you liked Fifty Shades of Gray then you will love this book. Don't download the sample just buy the book you won't be disappointed!
B00005QCVT|5.0|Requiem is definitely a very different film for the common movie goer. This film displays masterful filmmaking top to bottom. Cinematography, acting, directing, editing and soundtrack are all top notch. Not for everybody though. This film can emotionally pull you in many directions, not many movies go to the dark depths that this movie goes to, while also being achingly beautiful, and these polar opposites are also what make the ending all the more tragic.  I would suggest this movie to anybody that is interested in something different.
B00701L5XS|3.0|Shows how to tie knots, but could have a little better platform for looking them up. Also could use a better \\"how they are used\\" section.  Still fun to watch.  Get some rope and tie away!

B001QB9H1A|4.0|No one should ever go to a Luc Besson movie expecting brain power. But for anyone who wants a good action fix, his movies always deliver. \\"Transporter 3\\", the third installment of the Besson-penned \\"Transporter\\" series starring Jason Staham, not only provides the fix but also a suggestion that one should leave their brain out the front door for a piece of the fun.<br /><br />The first two \\"Transporter\\" movies were run-of-the-mill action movies that had some impressive fighting sequences but generic storytelling. \\"3\\" is easily the most inventive and enjoyable due to the fact that it takes implausibility to a whole new level and is aware of it. For example, how to make of the incomprehensible plot where the sharp-suited baddie (played with irresistible oiliness by Robert Knepper) kidnaps a Ukrainian minister's daughter named Valentina (Natalya Rudakova) to persuade him to bring eight toxic container ships into the Odessa harbor? Even if he did, what makes one think that he can get away with it, with not only so many ships but so much substance lingering on board? For some reason, this involves the Transporter (Jason Staham), who is blackmailed into traveling halfway across Europe with Valentina until the baddie can succeed in persuading the minister (why they can't just have her locked up in a basement or a building instead of hiring an experienced killer to travel across Europe I have no idea?). But here's the twist: Staham and the girl are forced to wear bracelets that will explode if they walk past 75 feet from the car.<br /><br />Yes, as you can see, the plot makes no sense. But who cares about the plot when you want some action? The incomprehensible plot is all just an excuse to see Staham kick some a--, drive cars at 200 mph and get lovey-dovey with the Ukrainian hostage. The car chases are entertaining enough (particularly the one where Staham has to drive in an angular position to avoid getting sandwiched by two trucks) but the explosive bracelet element adds greater pleasure (and silliness) to the fun. One of my favorite scenes that would never happen in real life is where Staham is fired from his driving service and is forced to ride a conveniently placed bicycle to catch up to the car before he explodes. Then in a really great scene that has to be seen to be believed, Staham and his car take a plunge in the water. To avoid drowning AND blowing up, Staham takes out two rafts from the trunk and fills them up using the tires' air to cause the car to ascend to the surface. Moments later, the car works fine and he drives off after the baddie.<br /><br />To accentuate the pacing and make the action more exciting than it is, Besson and director Oliver Megaton rely on fast-cutting, unconventional angles, flashbacks, dissolves and whirling camera movements to create a kaleidoscope of visual eye-candies that are pleasing, even if implausibility is obvious. In an early scene, when Staham checks on a transporter after crashing through his house, the mere mention of \\"Malcolm\\" causes the movie to flashback to the scene where Staham rejects a job by Knepper's accomplices, leading to a frantic melee. Besson may not be a smart storyteller but he and his crew are gifted in using visuals and editing to take a potentially disastrous product and turn it into a lean, mean fighting machine.<br /><br />The characterization, as usual in a Besson movie, is two-dimensional but serves its purpose. Knepper makes a nasty villain; Rudakova looks good, even when she mangles English; and Jason Staham is a cool, reserved badass, never laughing but always kicking butt. François Berl&eacute;and, who plays Staham's ally Inspector Tarconi, provides appropriate comic relief and support for our main hero.<br /><br />There are moments in the movie that leave you wondering how that's even possible but \\"Transporter 3\\" doesn't care what you think; it just wants to entertain. In that sense, it does its job. Sure, it's mindless fun but it's mindless fun done with style.<br /><br />Recommended.e.<br /><br />Recommended.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app all the time.  It helps me plan for the week.  I love how you can look at the weather in other places for travel purposes.
030758836X|2.0|I don't see what so many people like about this book. It was an easy read and I liked the idea of it (thus the two stars), but I figured out the twist very, very early on. The characters are the worst people in the world and I hated them so much. I wanted everyone to just die horrible deaths at the end of this book. I always finish books, and I got through this one fast because I didn't want it to take longer than it needed to. Maybe this isn't my type of book, but maybe it's because I like to read something that is half-way interesting, a little likeable and didn't make me want to toss it against a wall all of the time. This book came recommended by three people I know, and now I'm wondering if they were all playing a cruel joke on me. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Praise is often lavished too readily but for \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" all the accolades are justified. This film owes its place among cinema's greatest achievements because of a quality which occasionally emerges when talent combines to create something special.<br /><br />It's impossible not to admire the grandeur of the sweeping desert scenes, photographed by Freddie Young in Super Panavision 70 (no CGI here!), blending with Maurice Jarre's majestic soundtrack; the imaginative transitional editing which so inspired the likes of Steven Spielberg; Robert Bolt's provocative screenplay with its ironic twists and character complexities; the spectacular battle sequences full of swirling colour; and not least the mesmerising Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, superbly supported by Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins and the rest. All these elements were moulded under the hands of director David Lean into a film that has become an enduring masterpiece. His vision, understanding of the subject matter, mastery of technique, eye for detail and uncompromising standards present us with a riveting desert saga based on the exploits of enigmatic British army officer, T.E. Lawrence, during the Arab Revolt in the First World War. Lean's work is now restored to its original pristine state, the transfer to blu-ray injecting it with a refreshing vitality.<br /><br />Some find it difficult to accept western actors in Arab roles and the film is indeed a product of the early 'sixties, when such things were common practice. But it should be remembered that Alec Guinness as Faisal was mistaken for the Prince on the set by people who knew him, and that Lean himself did not recognize Anthony Quinn when he first arrived made up in Arab costume. To my mind both actors appear perfectly natural alongside Omar Sharif, an ethnic Arab, in their scenes together. O'Toole's portrayal of Lawrence has drawn criticism also as too egotistical. The truth is that T.E. Lawrence was a difficult man to understand and that cinema by its nature must distort to some degree in order to create the illusion of reality. Where the film unquestionably succeeds is in its depiction of a character with divided loyalties struggling to reconcile personal demons amid the horrors of war. Although the real Lawrence comes across as a more subdued personality in his book \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\\"--which Bolt studied for his script--it's clear that he was a tortured soul.<br /><br />Such issues are, anyway, superfluous because this is not an historical documentary. It is an epic adventure story staged in a landscape of austere and perilous beauty. For newcomers to the film I should do no better than to quote the Lawrence character: \\"It's going to be fun.\\" To say they don't make films like this any more may be a cliche but in the case of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" they really don't.\\"that cinema by its nature must distort to some degree in order to create the illusion of reality.

B008JH5CVS|1.0|Good prison scenes--the rest--pretty poor writing and acting (dialogue will literally aggravate you, terrible), crap CGI. If you are looking for an action movie, it will let you down.
B00000J7SS|5.0|So:  back when this album came out I thought I was this clever, progressive kid, all of 14 years old, and full of wisdom and, hey, I knew all about music because I'd worked through Arbans with my trumpet and my guitar teacher had taught me more theory than anyone in my high school jazz band knew.  I played trumpet in an orchestra and knew my Brahms and my Wagner and my Beethoven.  I was oh, oh, so clever.<br /><br />Then one night, in my pretentious, faux-cool 14-year-old way I was listening to the old KQRS in Minneapolis (those from that era in the Twin Cities will remember when that station actually played great music) -- and they played the lead cut in &#34;Bitches Brew.&#34;<br /><br />I was completely arrested.<br /><br />I'd never heard anything like this in my life.  It grabbed me somewhere in the depths of the heart and it stirred and shook me in a way James Bond would never have taken his Vodka Martini, and then it poured me out on the floor to dry up for a bit.  I thought I knew music.  That experience (along with subsequent listening to this and more Miles from the same era) taught me that I didn't know diddly.<br /><br />It was my privilege a few months later to see Miles live at the Guthrie in Minneapolis, playing with Goodman, Coreira, Airto, and (I think) Williams.  No Maupin or Mcglaughlin, and no bassist (Dave Holland was said to be in a holding pattern over Chicago).  Didn't matter -- amazing night.  Everything I thought I knew about the trumpet, and about music theory, and a lot of other things, well, I learned I was wrong.<br /><br />Miles Davis is a tragic figure in American life -- a world-changing genius with terrible habits and a sad end.  But I'm still glad he was part of my life, and that he offered me a brave, new world.

B008GOAFBQ|3.0|for what's supposed to be a release celebrating the 35th anniversary (well, technically it's been 36, but who's counting?) of 'destroyer', not a helluva lot has been brought to the party.<br /><br />honestly, all in all it's an interesting remix, particularly for the \\"side one\\" songs, \\"god of thunder\\" benefiting the most. after that, it's touch-and-go the rest of the way. there's an inexcusable editing gaffe on \\"flaming youth\\" that's quite obvious, and only the staunchest of kiss apologists will be able to rationalize such a mistake appearing on a major-label release.<br /><br />it's also pretty much a bare-bones release in the \\"bonus features\\" department, the lone extra being a second version of \\"sweet pain\\" with an alternate solo. so basically, if you're looking for demos, outtakes, and/or live versions---you know, stuff that you'd expect on an \\"anniversary\\" reissue---then keep on walking, 'cuz you won't find it here.<br /><br />'destroyer' is greater than a 3-star rating, but the bottom line is 'destroyer resurrected' is sort of anticlimactic....it's probably worth a listen, but it's not an essential buy if you already own the original version....
0345803493|3.0|I purchased this book because of all the hype.  I have to say Darker is better than the first.  I couldn't stand Christian & his attitude in the first book.  He seem to mellow out in Darker.  The writing still isn't the greatest.  It's either improved or I'm getting accustom to it.  I began to notice that I started eye rolling after all the repeated eye rolling, her inner goddess, her fifty, hard line, hair grabbing...  The first book I as able to put down even in the middle of a sex scene.  Darker had me pulled in a little bit more.  Possible because it seemed more realistic.  Although willing to get married within a few weeks isn't so realistic.  There was actually a decent story line to this book.  If you can get past all the times they are mad at each other & having sex, which is pretty much daily on both, you can enjoy this book.  I wouldn't rush out & tell all my friends this is a must read.  But I would say it's decent & you might as well read what all the hype is about.  I do plan to read Freed.  I have a feeling it's going to be beyond realistic.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game hooked me right away. I couldn't put it down! I suggest starting with level 1 and working your way up to get the hang of it.  I have referred it to others and they have also found it to be very fun too. I definitely. recommend this game!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I usually hate touchscreen games because the controls block the screen.  But this game only requires you to touch 1 spot.  Super fun side scroller.
0143120581|4.0|This was a very interesting, entertaining book. The book was not what I expected - I thought it would be more of a parenting guide, a \\"how to\\", rather than a personal reflection, but useful nonetheless. Well done to the author - very honest and open book
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app helps you engage in the reading. I love reading the word everyday and it has really changed my life just by picking the word up and getting knowledge. and being one step closer to GOD.
B001AG52AG|1.0|I can't believe the lack of integrity in this film. Even putting aside how incredibly untrue the film is to the book, it's just a very poorly made movie. Ichk.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|The song is a song that i like from phil collins. i purchased the item  and had no problem downloading the song.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Okay, I did pay to read ALL three. I loved the story line. The actual writing wasn't that great. Some parts seemed to repeat throughout the book. I did think the series got better with the second and third books. All things considered, I don't regret the time and money I spent. It was okay.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the game it keeps you entertained I like the idea but the games can be hard I would revoked it if you dont have a lot of time
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|Everything about this DVD and CD is amazing! in the DVD (which is the live show) they are in Long Beach, California and since that's their hometown they seem to have tried more to put out a great show. From the beginning to the end It had me exited to see how they played the next song. The DVD is amazing and just for this alone I would recommend you buying this.<br />The CD comes with  11 songs, and they are all really good. These songs aren't live, in case you're wondering. I heard the CD after I saw the DVD and I still was exited to hear each song they play. Every song from Demons to Afterlife (Alternate Version) were great. Overall I have to give this a 5/5. I love it. I recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am on fifty shades freed. I must say the first book was ok but the end made me want to read fifty shades darker. Excellent book and it made me want to read fifty shades freed. I can not wait to finish it!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this trilogy. I couldn't put them down. Very erotic! Nice love story. I am actually reading this a second time because I enjoyed it so much the first time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is one of my very favorite games. I find it challenging, fun and relaxing. Very addictive. So glad I decided to get this one.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I LOVED this book.  The characters sucked me in very quickly and I was emotionally vested in Lake and Will.  There are surprises, so it is NOT your typical predictable romance novel.  It is a young adult romance, but I'm 33 and married with 2 kids and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Also loved Point of Retreat and can't wait for the third novel.  My only regret is that I have to wait for more Colleen Hoover novels!! I will automatically buy all future work.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|As a disclaimer I typically enjoy terrible horror movies. The cheesier and lower budget the better. This film however, was neither. A well thought out flick with a twist on the teen slasher / hill billy genre. The tale chronicles two well meaning country boys as a group of teens believe that locals are trying to kill them. Hilarity ensues as the group of youngsters self destruct, much to the amazement of Tucker and Dale who try their best to stop the students from hurting themselves. A highly underrated film and a must see for anyone who enjoys a splash of comedy with their gore. Great acting and high cinematic production values only add to the plots appeal.<br /><br />Just watched it again for the third time. I can't even begin to express how hilarious this movie is. It only gets better with every view!! I can't recommend this movie enough.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|Excelente edición blu ray de secret world de Peter Gabriel. Imagen y sonido espectacular, alta definición, este video es una joya
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really fun and addicting game.after I played one time I could not stop.and the games are extremely fun they have super fun games like hockey, darts and race car driving. I recommended it to 3 people they all got it and loved it. I highly recommend this game to many people.
B002SG8A56|4.0|I love flight of the conchords! And I love that it came with a CD of a few of their songs. Love it!
145162445X|5.0|I have read multiple books that are generally related to the topic covered by Krauss, but WOW, this book is simply incredible.  The book walks the reader through how essentially a Universe or even a Multiverse could have arisen from essentially nothing.  Of course we also learn what \\"nothing\\" really means on the quantum level which, at least to me, was the most mind inflating part of the book and there are a lot of mind inflating topics.
B004QPUGRW|4.0|I received a different version of the book than was advertised, but it's basically the same thing with a different cover so no big deal.  Everything else was great.
B00884GR0W|3.0|It's an engaging game, to be sure, but its technical difficulties make it not worth buying. The game will freeze often, requiring the user to return to the Fire home screen. Of course any progress made between the last save and the game locking up will be completely lost.<br /><br />A better tutorial in the game would have been nice; the interface is good but there's little explanation of what the various elements do.
0763644765|5.0|Absolutely adore this book!  It is very well written and ever so delicately handled on such a subject as potty training.<br /><br />The illustrations are top notch and catch the eye of the child as he/she focuses on just the baby trying to figure out how to go potty.  No background distractions or bright colors to keep the child focused on what the subject matter is.<br /><br />The book keeps the child's interest till the very end and yet the child knows what the author is talking about.  Very nicely done!!
B000CNFC76|5.0|At the time of this writing the DVD and the Blu-ray versions are the exact same price.  If I was buying the movie for the first time, given that choice, I'd get the Blu-ray.  But, if the pricing changes, know that the difference in the transfer onto the DVD and the Blu-ray is absolutely minimal.  I have switched back and forth viewing scenes between the DVD and the BD.  The only noticeable difference between the two is that the faces in the distance have slightly more definition on the BD.  The closeups are virtually identical.<br /><br />As others have said it is a great Disney family movie that also happens to be about an iconic milestone in golf, the 1913 US Open and the people involved.  Hollywoodness aside, it is a great golf film too, one that belongs in every golfer's movie collection.
0312330537|5.0|Wonderful, awesome book.  I really hope it becomes a film.  Highly recommend.  Great way to learn about india and to understand more of that wonderful culture and history.  It is a big book and in this case Bigger IS Better !

B0084IG7KC|1.0|This is nothing more than propaganda to corrupt our children. After 30 mins into it, I just turn it off and went out to get some air as I found this film utter trash. Jerky camera, worthless plot, just skip this garbage.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy was a great trilogy. It can really grab the readers attention. I love how the author is so descriptive of everything that goes on in the book. For the price that I got these books for on Amazon was a steal. I would really suggest it to everyone to buy this trilogy from Amazon.
0307346617|4.0|I wavered between a 4- and 5-star rating for this book; it's that good. This is my second time to read World War Z, and it was just as enjoyable the second time around.<br /><br />This story poses as a future history, chronicling the lives of those who have survived \\"the crisis,\\" a worldwide zombie plague. Several of you are probably already mousing toward the next review, assuming this is yet another zombie story, but let me promise that you're wrong. You'll have to suspend disbelief to the same extent you do in the works of Tolkien or Lucas, but Brooks does a nearly-equal job of captivatingly portraying the human experience in a unique situation.<br /><br />Brooks tells his tale by following a journalist across the world, as he catalogs true stories from survivors. Through that lens, Brooks is able to delve into fascinating ideas of how various nations would handle an apocalyptic crisis. Israel shuts down its borders and employs guard dogs to sniff out the infected, whereas China begins by assuming it can throw bodies at the incoming horde to slow their progress, until leaders realize that those bodies are reanimating and becoming yet another foot soldier for the opposition.<br /><br />One of the book's strengths lies in Brooks' ability to write in a variety of voices. The tale is really a collection of short stories, as the journalist interviews survivors, and remarkably, each survivor speaks uniquely. Brooks was able (generally) to write outside himself, providing a new voice and new emotions to each character. You'll read of heartbreak and loss in one chapter, and the next page will throw you into an interview with a mercenary whose bloodlust has long since rendered him unfit for normal suburban society.<br /><br />Ultimately, I give this book four stars rather than five for Brooks' few failure to step outside his own American ideology. In one chapter, a Cuban interviewee describes how the arrival of American refugees on Cuban soil slowly led the island nation to a transformation, the result of which was a national embracing of capitalism and democracy. Later, Brooks writes of an immigrant from El Salvador who had been deported before the crisis, but upon learning of the zombie outbreak fought his way up through Mexico and back to America -- not because he had any friends or family there, but simply because he loved the country so much. I don't mean to suggest that Brooks is a flag-waving American, but those two passages are illustrative of a few other places where the author lets national stereotypes cloud his writing.<br /><br />Outside of that solitary criticism, I highly recommend World War Z for what it is: a significant addition to a growing collection of zombie stories, a great work of fiction, and an often thought-provoking look at how the world would handle an international crisis of unprecedented proportions.to a transformation, the result of which was a national embracing of capitalism and democracy.

0307341577|3.0|This was a good read. If I could I would give it 3 1/2 stars. A very dark book where you have to read a couple chick lit books in between. It was more predictable than Sharp Objects and Gone Girl. I give both of those books 5 stars. I just finished Gone Girl tonight and was again amazed by Gillian Flynn's \\"awesomeness\\".
067170608X|3.0|This book's cover proclaims And Then There Were None to be the world's best-selling mystery and quotes one publication as naming it \\"Agatha Christie's masterpiece.\\" Christie wrote an author's note preceding the story, in which she notes that she was really pleased with this book because only she knew how difficult it was to write.<br /><br />Difficult to write because Christie set out to tell a murder mystery in which ten people were killed without the story becoming ridiculous or the killer becoming obvious. Christie accomplishes that task cleverly as ten men and women are lured to a lonely island off the coast of Devon, England. Once there, each of the ten is immediately accused of past crimes for which they were never committed. For those evils, each must now die. As the ten learn they cannot escape the island, they race to uncover the murderer's true identity, knowing it must be one of their own number.<br /><br />Darkness permeates every page of this tale, as you likely guessed from the plot synopsis. Each character struggles with their sordid past, while outwardly justifying themselves and denying guilt. The ten attempt to socialize and dine with one another, despite the fact that they know one of their number intends to murder them all.<br /><br />I appreciated the book's epilogue, in which Christie explains (from a voice within the story) the entire scheme and how it was pulled off. These 300+ pages flew by as I hurried to uncover the killer's identity, but I didn't guess the solution before Christie wrote it out for me. This is a great, fast-paced mystery, although its dark subject matter and dialogue wouldn't make the best bedtime reading.
030758836X|5.0|If you enjoyed Sharp Objects, you will LOVE this book. This is my absolute favorite book by Gillian Flynn. A must read!
B007NESBK2|5.0|Been a fan of Sade since Diamond Life, remember being mesmerised by her as a kid only 4 years old and loving the track, YOUR LOVE IS KING and SMOOTH OPERATOR, I had practically given up on the return of SADE, 10 years seemed to long, when she returned it was with full force, and this concert will blow your mind. Sophie Muller her long time collaborator, has taken the live aspect of SADE to oblivion, the opening, Sade appears on stage through a stairway under the stage, absolutely stunning, she starts the show with the incredible song Soilder of Love, she sings all her classic hits, from Paradise, No Ordinary Love, By your Side, plus her incredible tracks from her current Soilder of Love, another favourite is the track LOVE IS GONE, the visuals are stunning, SADE looks stunning, her body still amazing, her band still looks hot, incredible, I wish she came to South Africa, because I know that if she ever comes back it could be another 10 years, I may never see her with my own two eyes live, but this is the next best thing.
0307341550|5.0|This book is a quick read packed with a lot of punch. I also give Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn 5 stars.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I just finished 'Wild' in record time (2 days for me, which is very fast!) and I have to write that it was one of the most honest, heart wrenching, and \\"beyond brave\\" books I have ever read.  There was every emotion depicted in this book.  Coming from somone who is not inclined to be emotional, especially from a book, I have to say that I was thoroughly enlightened and touched with almost every single page.  I could never in a million years imagine setting out on that soul searching journey that Cheryl took alone in the wilderness, but I'm so grateful that she found the bravery not only to go on that journey for herself, but also to share her journey with the world.  I live in California and travel up to Tahoe a few times a year and now every time I cross over the Summit (even though detours were taken around the snow ridden sections of the PCT when Cheryl was on her journey) I will think of Cheryl and how brave she was throughout her PCT experience.  Bravo to her and her honest, brilliantly written story.
034580404X|5.0|I really thought these books would be boring because everyone around me were saying they were good books.

B007STBUIW|5.0|Jaws on Blu-Ray Disc is great and the remastered 1080p transfer is a amazing experience in High Def. Jaws remains one of my favorite films of all-time. It's the movie that jump started Steven Spielberg career as a filmmaker.Universal Studios Home Entertainment did a great job at restoring this film on Blu-Ray. The 7.1. DTS HD Master Audio mix is great but I like the mono mix better because that is the sound mix for Jaws that won the Oscar for best sound. Jaws on Blu-Ray Disc is awesome and is a must buy.
0425263908|4.0|I felt this book was too quick to jump into a steamy sex scene.  She meets him one day and the next day he's dry humping her in his office. I felt this book was a little quick on the sex with very little character building until after they had sex for the first time.  Once she started giving a little more info on these characters, it got a little more interesting.  I did feel that all of them were just a little too beautiful.  Not one Of them had a insecurity of themselves.  I will get the next one and read that to see how they develop.<br />Overall, this was a decent read for a fifty filler.

B0034G4OVS|5.0|This movie was very intense and kind of disturbed me (couldn't get certain things out of my mind afterward).  My palms were sweating through most of it (kind of like when I watch a movie and someone is hanging from the ledge of a skyscraper).  I also felt really bad for the kids.  Definitely a terrifying story.  It's kind of like how the plot of 127 Hours sounds like it could be slow and boring, but is actually intense the whole time.  That's how I felt about this one.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love the sleek style. It looks and feels like an actual book. Perfect for any book lovers with an Amazon Kindle Fire.
B008ETOSYI|3.0|Wow, I don't think the reviewer who said,\\"Great acting\\" knows what great acting is.  This was seriously a \\"B-flick\\" movie.  Story was cheesy and predictable.  Acting was terrible, thus the B-flick statement.  The main male character, Logan, played by Zack Efron, was too young for this role.  He looked too much like a 19-yr old hitting on a  27-yr old woman with a child.  Seriously, this is a cheesy movie for those who love Zack Efron and Nicholas Sparks.  Sad.

B0041B785Y|5.0|\\"I'm the great Leviathan, insatiable colossus. Titanic engulfer of lives, I reward you, absorb you...\\" And so begins Meshuggah's latest sonic assault. And assault it is - don't try getting your paperwork done with this one coming through the speakers; bench pressing a small car maybe, as this offering is 55 minutes of pure, precise, thunder. I've been a Meshuggah fan for many years and I found this to be the most accessible album they've ever released. Don't get me wrong, the mind-blowing musical precision and timing are still there, but the lyrical content (a healthy dose of rage at many of the manifestations of those in \\"power\\" )and...dare I say, groove, make KOLOSS a near perfect study in power.
030758836X|4.0|I generally don't buy hyped books because they rarely live up to the billing.  This was the exception.  Well-written, good pace, hard to put down.  Where it went from 5 to 4 stars for me, though, was when it lost believability.  She did an excellent job of making believable characters which made the story good, but a little more than 60% in the belivability was lost and it was disappointing.  But still glad to have read it.

0812993292|5.0|This is the first book I actually have written a review about which stands to attest to my enthusiasm about it.  It is a story about humanity, the perseverence of the human sprit,  the longevity of true love and the failings of mothers, fathers, children and people in general.  I smiled often in reading this book and cried at times and ultimately fell in love with Harold.  What a gifted writer Joyce is and how I look forward to reading more by her in the future.

B008GOAFBQ|5.0|I will say, i wish there would have been live tracks, songs not used, but I have to say, i love the sound of this cd. its full, rich and i am glad to have it. I have been A big Kiss fan from the time I was 8 years old. I love this band, and when you hear the 1978 version and this new 2012 version, who could not love it. The remix, if you wanna call it that, I was hoping it was gonna be more drastic, and while old fan feel there is no need, I love having 2 versions of this classic cd. If your a big Kiss fan, you will love it. I am happy to have and get new music from this band. I wish they would go back and do this to every one of there cds. its great fun.

B004LWZWGK|4.0|Director Christopher Nolan helped legitimize the comic book hero Batman, as grounded in the real world in Batman Begins and its landmark sequel, The Dark Knight.  Many trilogies fail to maintain the promise of the superior sequel (Spiderman II, The Godfather Part II, and Road Warrior), but in rare cases, there have been great third acts like Toy Story 3, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, and now The Dark Knight Rises.  Though it fails to surpass its predecessor, as an ambitious film with grand designs and elaborate themes, it mostly succeeds.<br /><br />Several years after the events of The Dark Knight, the legacy of Harvey Dent lives on as crime has been stifled in Gotham City and the wealthy and elite hold sway.  Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a hobbled recluse whose masked hero, Batman, has been hunted and banished under false pretenses.  Gotham is pristine and ready for a new age, and relics like Batman and even Commissioner Gordon are not needed anymore and obsolete.  A mysterious masked villain named Bane (Thomas Hardy) begins a calculated reign of terror which paralyzes the city.  But what is his motive and what does this have to do with Batman? As Gordon (Gary Oldman) pleads for the return of the caped crusader and the city cries out for salvation, Batman must overcome a very powerful Bane to save the city.  He is aided by his servant Alfred (Michael Caine), technical wizard Lucius (Morgan Freeman), and a young cop, John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and bedazzled by two mysterious women, Selina (Anne Hathaway) and Miranda (Marion Cottilard).  But first, Bruce Wayne must return from the abyss to confront his past and battle for Gotham City's future.<br /><br />The briskly paced 2 hour 45 minute film is always engaging with memorable moments.  The opening sequence is a marvelous midair hijack right out of a Bond film. (Come to think of it, Nolan's got the Bond thing down as in the snowy climax of Inception.)  A scene where a doctor gives Wayne failing marks in his physical is amusing.  The climactic action between the forces of good and evil recalls the finale to Metropolis and the face off of its protagonist and antagonist are right out of Enter the Dragon.<br /><br />Nolan likes intricate puzzles; witness Momento and Inception.  He takes previous storylines including the convoluted ending of The Dark Knight and serves some nice twists here.  The film is a cleverly built trap, and Batman's fall from grace is a rapid decent into the depths of hopelessness and despair. To be great again, he has to literally and figuratively climb his way back; in a sense, the fates of the masked avenger and Gotham City are linked.<br /><br />The film is able to explore some interesting relationships both past and present, and duality of key characters is a recurring theme. For Wayne, Commissioner Gordon and Alfred are fatherly figures through his orphaned childhood and adult life.  Selina and Miranda are women with different backgrounds and agendas.  Blake, the idealistic, honest cop shares a common bond with Wayne.  Even Batman, the tortured, self sacrificing hero has a counterpart in Bane, the ultimate, super terrorist, who is intelligent, cunning, and ruthless.<br />With so many characters, it is remarkable how Nolan and screenwriter/brother Jonathan Nolan are able to weave together storylines featuring each role prominently.  In particular, the paradoxical Selina is a `cat burglar' and a survivor who has to learn how to trust another person.  Her interaction with Wayne always intrigues as they play out a kind of dance, and we wonder her true motives.  She is a kind of outsider and observer of the events that will determine the fate of Gotham City.<br /><br />The film boldly tackles major themes adding layer upon layer.  It's about past sins and morality: the great deception over Harvey Dent for the greater good presents risks and has severe consequences here.  Amid complacency there is class warfare: as Bane incites the masses and bolsters his numbers, the city faces a dichotomy of the proletariat versus the bourgeoisie.  The film also tests the concept of trust and faith: sometimes the ones we trust betray us while others may surprise us with their loyalty.<br /><br />There are minor missteps e.g. immaculate streets when the city's infrastructure is at a standstill.  A brief moment at a cafe at film's end reveals a bit too much of a truth when subtle reactions could have sufficed.  The film's tone is dark, angst filled with rare moments of humor. That's not a knock on the film but don't go expecting Avengers type of laughs.  There's also an amusing cameo in the role of President and a macabre return of a key villain.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer's minimalist pulse keeps the mood humming along.  Visuals are technically outstanding with minimal use of computer generated effects, and this is where it deviates from the more colorful, super heroes of The Avengers and X Men.  Here we have a hero and backdrop that is set in a believable world which heightens realism and credibility.<br /><br />Brimming with ideas as it challenges us in ways most action films movies don't, The Dark Knight Rises is a strong conclusion to the trilogy.  A deeply allegorical film that demands repeated viewings to truly appreciate its intricacies, it dares to bend and reinvent the mythology of the caped crusader, and although it doesn't quite trump The Dark Knight, which set the bar impossibly high, its vision at times carries its audience to wonderful, lofty heights.

0345803485|5.0|( This review shoud be read after reading all 3 books although dont' think there are any spoilers if you read now.)<br /><br />50 Shades of Grey is surely about hot steamy sex as it is entwined completely through all three books, but it is about much more. For the many that snubbed this book because it was too shallow most likely didn't get very far.<br /><br />After one reads the first 25 love scenes really way before that, you realize how amazing the two main characters are. The delicate layers of their relationship gradually open up to the intense complexities of love relations and commitment in general. The pain ensued after each long revealing talk is mirrored by the full dimensions of their love making.<br /><br />You put together one very screwed up guy with a very damaging and hurtful childhood with an intelligent yet clumsy and naive young lady also with some childhood baggage and within weeks that type of relationship would normally be doomed. But through constant and wild communication through intense sex AND talk you see how two people gain the courage to really find one another. Their layers of anxiety, fear, and desire for understanding keep getting peeled away layer by layer with deeper knowledge of one another's psyche.<br /><br />The sex really becomes a metaphor for how two people both learn about their own needs and desires as well as their mates in ways that most couples rarely explore. But just like any learning experience it seems to take each one moving baby steps forwards or backwards before they move on and grow and change or stay the same. The pain inflicted during some of the sexual acts seems to accompany the pain inflicted because of taking emotional steps backwards. The dance of pain, joy, peace, love, excitement, climax and sheer exhaustion reflect the way they and people in general feel when exposing their emotional and physical selves.<br /><br />It seems that each sex act in the book was a rumination of how one sees oneself and their mate from every angle physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. The guts and grit by which they tackle one another's issues over and over is played out in every sequence of talk and sex or sex and talk, over and over and over again.<br /><br />The book keeps \\"grinding\\" its way through to what seems like a more peaceful place for both of them by the end. However, if the author is trying to demonstrate that life is not a bowl of cherries unless you really are present each minute with those you love, I expect if the author decides to continue their story there will be continuing questions of commitment and how to gain trust and faith in those you love as well as the world one confronts each day.<br /><br />So enjoy the steamy sex throughout the book but also take the time to think about how the lives of the main characters and events surrounding them are a reflection of what we all cope with each day. Christian's character is a testament to how someone who was damaged early on and developed a negative coping style was able to stretch his emotional capacity in a positive way with the guidance of a loving partner and significant others. Anastasia was guided by her own desire to grow and find sexual and emotional maturity through her scrappy and sometimes annoying persistence. Her growth was helped tremendously by Christian's strong commitment even while fighting his own demons. It would have been a very dull series of books if only about sex and didn't include the constant struggle between the two of them which slowly blossomed into understanding and love.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I LOVE this book.  I have never heard of any of this Paleo diet stuff but now I have read the book cover to cover, I really believe in it.  It all makes sense and is easy to read.  The book's idea is why not try this paleo lifestyle for 30 days and see what the effect is?  That certainly can't hurt.  So I have done a lot of preparation and am into Day 3 of my 30 day programme and I am psyched.  There is a great website and forum that go with the book.

B00846REIS|5.0|If you like 50 Shades of Grey then you will love this series!!  Bare to You was a great read, quick, and highly entertaining!!  Because Silvia Day is a write of erotica she just got to the point not such a build up to the dirty parts which I loved because it took 3 attempts with 50 Shades before I was hooked and with this it was immediate.  Cannot wait for the next one!!  Highly recommended this to anyone looks for a fun distracting read!

I must be a masochist because I am bound and determined to finish the book. Pretty much everything that is wrong with the books has been said...the characters are frustrating and all they do is fight and make-up through all the books!! It's so freaking boring to read and found myself skipping the sex scenes just to find out if anything interesting was going to happen. Nope...never did...maybe the movie will be better.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|That's quite a message to receive in your Amazon suggestions, and not knowing from Whom this directive came, I had no intention of being defiant.<br /><br />I didn't love the app, because it got too in-my-face with daily interaction. I really wanted it as a reference app for when I need to do church work and for general theological inquiries. So I learned I'd have to limit its notifications, but if you want daily readings brought to your attention, this will provide nicely.<br /><br />But I like the Bible itself, so I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />I give zero stars to those who use it as an instrument of torture and hate, resting upon it as a crutch they misinterpret as some divine approval of their narrow-minded, misanthropic needs to have everyone do everything exactly as they do (or more accurately, exactly as they ADMIT to doing, especially under eyes they fear to be as judgmental and bile-filled as their own).<br /><br />As a reference tool, this app does quite nicely.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|The lag is a deal breaker. The game itself is great, but all the repeated pauses on kindle fire make it damn near impossible to actually do well. Hopefully Halfbrick will fix this issue. This is the only reason it gets 3 stars, fixed will get 5.

0812993292|5.0|This is one of the most charming, poignant books I have read in years.  I should make it clear that I am in mhy 60's and have a lot of life experience.  Readers who don't may find it hard to grasp the true beauty of this book....relationships between children and their parents, long term marriage, facing tragic loss, forgiveness and the kindness of strangers are all themes throughout the book.  Cannot recommend it highly enough.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|...Skip it.<br /><br />Burdensome, instruction-less games and ad after ad after ad.<br /><br />If the games were fun, easily picked up or stimulating on some level, I'd say it was worth the advertising because let's face it: it's a freebie.<br /><br />But this doesn't satisfy on any of those levels, and I'm being rather charitable and diplomatic giving it two whole stars.
B003U53GK8|5.0|Really this is like a soap opera but with an ending. On and on it went. Where it stops nobody knows. Except we do know. Unless Ben says he is lying again. I mean they staged an airplane crash so who knows. Seriously, people sleeping around and falling in love and then so and so dying etc. Everyone has been kidnapped at least once. Kate sleeps around. Sawyer sleeps around but his real name is James. Almost everyone on this island has commited a crime before coming to the island. I mean what are the chances of that many criminals on one plane? You have a con artist, a couple murderers, a drug addict, Korean mafia dude, Thieves with diamonds, kidnappers, ex-torurer,a rebel from uganda,a cop who is a murderer, and I am sure I am missing something else. But overall it was entertaining. I kept telling my husband I couldn't wait for it to be over. Just like a soap opera but with a light at the end of the tunnel. I was so thankful for it to be over. In a good way. Like the end of an addiction. I would reccomend this if you just want to be lost in front of the tv. It's a well structured story and good acting.  Annoying though because it takes 6 seasons to find out anything hardcore. I think Richard's story was much revealing. Anyways 5 stars for laying the story out. They really put a lot of planning into it.
B007BZM3HK|1.0|Please, enough with this ridiculous song.  Sure it had its 5 minutes of fame but seriously, who likes listening to something so repetitive?  Apparently most of you who only listen for choruses and do not buy any albums.  I bet you have your most recent purchases in your library but cannot even name the album/CD it came from.  Think about it and once your surprise wears off, how about you support your favorite artist by buying the entire album and learn the full spectrum of musical ability instead of letting radio/videos decide whats popular.

B0055MI8K2|1.0|This is the second pair of Teva sandals that I've owned. And this is the second pair that wore out in less than a year. Granted I wear them almost every day, but at the prices the Teva sell for, you should get more than just a few months out of them. The old Nike sandals that I used to get, which unfortunately were discontinued, were 1/3 - 1/2 the price of these and lasted much longer.

B007I2BZIE|3.0|Like most new Rush CDs, I had to listen to this several times before I could form an opinion.  This is a good Rush disc.  The music sounds great & there are many good songs.  Geddy's voice sounds more mature.  However, his vocals sound tired; that is the only way I can describe them.  While I am always happy to get new Rush material, I can't really point to a specific song/highlight on the disc.  There is just something about this disc that disappoints.  I can't put my finger on it.

B00822KWME|2.0|OK what is here is a hodge-podge of stuff, sequenced in reverse order (sort-of), some of their best stuff (sort-of), some new stuff (sort-of), large booklet (sort-of), what a half-a**ed effort here (sort-of)...  The booklet is HORRIBLE with no useful info at all.  And this just shows how BAD the Bob Welsh years were!!  Although they don't even have the best stuff from those in-between years here - where are Emerald Eyes and Future Games????  Wow the stuff from those in-between years is unlistenable (except for Hypnotized).  Even Christine McVies songs are pretty bad although hers are the best of the bunch from those years.  Sorry Bob - but you didn't deserve the Hall of Fame - very mediocre career.  Why not do it right???  It's not that hard people -- one disc for the best of the Peter Green blues years, 1/2 disc for the best of the in-between Peter Green and Lindsay Buckingham years, and 2-1/2 discs for the best of the Lindsay Buckingham and after years.  Throw in a few new songs/unreleased stuff and you've got it.  I'll even help pick out the songs!  Who ever put this together is a fool!

1573228737|5.0|Affinity is my favorite of Waters' books, perhaps because it's one of her most subtle and atmospheric.<br /><br />The book juxtaposes three Victorian \\"worlds\\": the world of working spiritualists, the world of women's prisons, and the world of upper middle-class Victorian lives. The first two are dramatic indeed, full of colorful theatrics in the first case and punitive logistics in the second. As always, Waters' research is impeccable, and allows her to craft a solid and convincing story around what could in other hands be difficult material.<br /><br />All three worlds are successfully evoked in the two intertwining first-person narratives that tell the story. The result is rich in emotion and detail, yet also bleak. Whether rich or poor, these are women with limited choices, who make the best moves they can given the restrictions that face them; in the end, both protagonists have made a difficult bargain, for all that one is even bleaker than the other. I've had friends call the book \\"depressing\\" for this reason, but I didn't find it so; the story arc feels right for these characters yet very different from the kind of life narratives we can craft today.<br /><br />Though the love story of the novel is one between women, the book's basic premise--an affluent young London woman makes charitable visits to Millbank prison, where a young spiritualist of complex if not dubious character is imprisoned--precludes virtually all physical intimacy. Perhaps for that reason, the story reads as human rather than lesbian per se, centered around a longing for love and recognition with which virtually any reader can identify.<br /><br />Margaret Prior's relationship with her repressive mother, Selina Dawes' varied relationships with her jailers: Relationships among women are explored in a variety of ways in the book, not only in the growing connection between its two protagonists. Power is always the issue at hand. Who has the power to choose a woman's life story? What must she do to redress the power imbalances to which her gender consigns her? How do women liberate each other, and imprison themselves and others? These questions sound dry, but Waters' many gifts shape them into compelling fiction.o to redress the power imbalances to which her gender consigns her?

B008BIN9EW|5.0|I've been playing this game for quite awhile from the Google Play store.  It consists of turn based strategy (TBS) gameplay utilizing one of three factions each of which have unique units.  The factions are similar to StarCraft, with the bugs (Khraleans) being weak but numerous, humans (Sapiens) evenly balanced jack of all trades but masters of none, and robots (Titans) powerful but expensive.  The single player campaign is essentially an extended tutorial so if you are unfamiliar with these types of games and have trouble learning from the basic text in the \\"How To Play\\" section, feel free to dive right into the campaign.  In fact, I recommend this as the campaign in my opinion was a much better teacher than the text only section.  It will slowly introduce you to each of the core concepts and through the course of the campaign will also introduce you to all three factions so you can get a feel for their differences.<br /><br />Once you are finished with the campaign there are options to play solo versus a single computer opponent or online versus computer bots or people.  The online modes have 1v1 all the way up to 4v4 or FFA.  There is also a map editor to create your own maps.  Maps can be posted online for others to play so there is a wide selection of maps to play from.<br /><br />In my opinion this is by far the best TBS game on Android at the moment and is quite polished as the game has been worked on consistently for years now.  As the game is mature, there is already a community of players and the developer has forums setup for any questions you might have.
0812992792|4.0|I really enjoyed Adam Johnson's \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\".  It's not an easy read, but not overly difficult either and worth the effort.  There's a lot to enjoy and even be amazed and appalled at and I'm certain I missed plenty more.  Protagonist Pak Jun Do (John Doe) is raised in an orphanage by his orphan master father in North Korea.  His mother's gone missing (taken to Pyongyang) and it's clear from the onset Jun Do struggles with who he is and where he comes from.  This struggle only increases once he's pulled from the orphanage to be a tunnel soldier (tae kwon do in the dark!).  Jun Do has it rough and the author spares no punches.<br /><br />Johnson does a great job describing the difficulties of being adrift without identity and what life in a regime such as North Korea can be like.  Things are very unpleasant for Do and some of the reading can be difficult if you're squeamish.  Do rises in the ranks and becomes a kidnapper for the regime (one with a heart, but one who does what it takes), an English translator on a fishing vessel (the best writing in a story full of good writing), a prisoner, and a murderer.  At each turn, brutal realities are revealed and the identity struggle within Do continues to fester.  This is made perhaps too obvious--or maybe not enough so--with the shift to Commander Ga (the book's Martin Guerre moment).  This is a fantastic novel full of adventure, great writing, understanding of human nature, and a glimpse into a brutal dictatorship.  A worthy read for certain.

It's science-based and incredibly informative. Dr. McDougalls' conviction, passion, and accessibility rooted from his desire to help others is truly surprising. I have personally emailed Dr. McDougall about a question in the past, and despite his busy schedule, he wrote back to me within an hour and a half. This is a lifestyle change I never plan on deviating from. It's helped my family and I so much.<br /><br />And for the guy in the review section claiming that the majority of these positive reviews are fake, just go to Dr. McDougalls' free website and visit the discussion forums. You can talk with the 'Star McDougallers' yourself and the growing list of people who participate on the forums daily who advocate this way of eating as vehemently I do.

B0076NKNLA|4.0|Most people would say Marilyn Monroe is synonymous with sexuality, but for me it was definitely all about her ability to draw you in and suspend you in her special magic where all else seemed to dim and fade away.  Somehow all the baggage one's collected and all the weight on one's shoulders can just fade away in captivation of the star singing \\"I want to be loved by you alone, Boop-boop-a-doop, boop-boop-a-doop!\\", \\"Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend\\", and \\"Happy Birthday, Mr President.\\"  Although Michelle Williams was awarded the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy Motion Picture and earned Best Actress nominations from the Academy Awards and British Academy Film Awards, for me she just didn't shine like a star but many other actors and aspects of [[ASIN:B0076NKNLA My Week With Marilyn]] did starshine and transport me into that special magic making it an enjoyable and memorable movie to view.<br /><br />The cinematography and costumes were wonderful transporting me to 1957 London including locations such as Saltwood Castle and Windsor Castle.  Many of the actors in the film did exude the same special Marilyn magic star quality including Eddie Redmayne.  Eddie Redmayne gave a fascinating performance in this movie speaking volumes with a mere expression and for me, he is the one who carries this movie depecting the week in which Monroe spent time being escorted around London by him.  Judi Dench also carried the movie by exuding the Marilyn special magic in her role as Dame Sybil Thorndike.  Julia Ormand and Emma Watson also shone and delivered the Marilyn magic to the viewer.  The American Film Institute in 1999 ranked Marilyn Monroe as the sixth greatest female star of all time.  While Williams does not demonstrate that quality of stardom or specialness and magic of Marilyn Monroe, [[ASIN:B0076NKNLA My Week With Marilyn]] did deliver transporting the viewer back into that special magic with the combined efforts of Redmayne, Dench, Ormand, Watson, costumes, cinematography, and  script.  By watching this one movie, one can taste again the specialness of that one star that shone so bright and was snuffed out too soon.<br /><br />Says Clark of his week with Marilyn, \\"here's what I remember most:  her embrace, her belief in me, and the joy she gave; that was her gift.  When I think of her now, I think of that time when a dream came true and my only talent was not to close my eyes.\\"tumes, cinematography, and  script.

Now that it has been pointed out to me I can see where the \\"Twilight\\" series and this series could be similar... I feel the addition of more sex scenes was a attempt to reach a older audience.

I found myself so caught up in their journey together and became emotionally involved!  It's a wonderful story that stays with you for a long time after finishing the book!  Can't wait for the movie!  Charlie Hunnam would make an excellent choice for Christian!  Would love to see the series continue; or read more from Christian's point of view!
030799029X|1.0|I don't like offering a review without having experienced the entire book but I made it only a third of the way thru the audiobook. Nothing of any importance happened. What little I learned about the characters was uncompelling and, if not trite, then on its way there. Still, I might have been able to finish this book if it hadn't been read in a perpetually flat monotone. Sorry -- I tried, I really tried but it just wasn't happening for me.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Come on Son, if you're going to offer a game on the ANDROID platform, at the very least take the word(s) iPHONE out of the description. :)<br /><br />Edit: I was preserving my final review. I will give it an extra Star (because I can't give it a half) for the nice graphics. With that said, unless you're into these types of games, the game play has a somewhat steep learning curve.<br /><br />For those who are critical of my simple review (before the edit) I'm pretty darn sure if you went to a FedEx store, I'm sure you wouldn't want to hear about UPS, correct? Someone had to call them on the use of iPhone in their description. Just saying!

0345529057|2.0|Don't get me wrong the books themselves are a great read, well written, and full of memorable characters. My problem is with the poor quality binding. I'm far from rough with my books, but while reading the first book pages began tearing lose from the binding. I could understand it happening if the book was forced all the way open, or maybe even if it was dropped and landed unluckily, but I was simply  reading it as I had assumed it, as a book, was meant for. In conclusion, the box set is a good value, but don't expect these books to last forever, because they likely will not last through the first or second read. Treat them very gently if you want them to last.

B00846REIS|2.0|This is the most pathetic rip off I've ever read.  Anyone involved in this novel (author, publisher, even Amazon)  should be ashamed of themselves.  It is a complete rip-off of 50 Shades.  There is nothing new here; just tired, already done characters (with the same issues and personality traits)  and plot.  Save your money.

I notice that there is a split second delay in the picture being clicked and the flash going off; hence the pictures are dark frequently. Some pictures come out ok. I am disappointed with this purchase and do not think that the money spent was worth it.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I found this to be a very good adaptation of the book.  While true there is one could never make a movie long enough to cover all of the background info that the book goes into, there was nothing left out that was important to the story line.
B001RTSPVY|3.0|Okay, I am going to go against the grain of other reviewers here and (without spoilers) give you the true scoop on Season 2.  As we all recall, Season 1 was more than riveting, it was groundbreaking storytelling at its finest.  Season 2 starts off this way and then takes a sharp decline.  It is almost as if the first three episodes and the last three episodes of Season 2 were written by someone else.  The middle episodes (while still better than most other schlock on television) seemed to drag on forever.  I cannot help it, I find Walt's wife to be the least likable, least interesting, and the character I would most love to see killed off in the entire series (with Hank a close second, but he gets better developed in Season 3).  Season 2 spends a lot of time focusing on Skyler, her pregnancy and Walt's medical condition.  Yeah, I am aware that these are central to the series, but enough already, we get it, can we move on to the more interesting aspects of this series?  Maybe it was just me, but I found the finale to be less than climactic and could see it coming from the second to last episode.  Maybe I am just jaded by how great Season 1 was and Season 3 is (which I am watching now - hint: Much more like Season 1 - AMAZING).  Again, I am not bashing this show, I find the entire series to be superior to most all others I have watched, however once you set such a high standard, it is imperative to live up to it with each episode and not throw fillers in mid-season just to drag the story out longer.  Tell your story clearly and concisely.  No, this is not a short-attention span thing, it is a classic storytelling rule that should be adhered to.  Admittedly, I watched the entire season in about 3 days, so maybe I was just overwhelmed by everything that was going on, but you would think that (given that short span of time) I would not have felt that the show was moving along too slow. Now, the haters can hate and bash this review, but if you are a true fan of this series, you must admit that I am right on at least a few points.  And for those comparing this series to THE SHIELD...come on!!!  THE SHIELD jumped the shark the minute they killed Lem.  The rest of that show was a jumbled mess.  THE SHIELD does not even deserve to stand in Breaking Bad's shadow.  Final thought: Breaking Bad is still one of the finest series ever. Period, full stop, end of discussion.

1402790546|5.0|I have just finished reading Bomber which is the first non-fiction work that I have read of Len Deighton. Like many other people, I have grown up after WWII and my impressions of war are mainly due to the Hollywood version. There is no glamour in war and this book shows its horror in unrelenting detail.<br /><br />The book encapsulates war by illustrating 24 hours of the air war taking place over Europe in 1943. The protagonists are the British for it was our Royal Air Force that was doing the bombing and the Germans who were doing the defending.<br /><br />It is ironic that only recently, records have been published which reveal how inaccurate and noneffective our mass saturation type bombing instigated by 'Bomber' Harris really was. Most bombs missed their target by distances of nearly a mile and the main storyline of the book relates how an 'innocent' rural town was eradicated by the chance event of one of the RAF's pathfinders being shot down.<br /><br />That single event caused the other bombers to mistakenly release their bomb-loads on the town rather than on their target several miles away. The moral dilemma is an acute one. Whose fault was it? Of course it must have been the bombers' fault, but if the pathfinder had not been shot down then it might have illuminated its intended target and the innocents would have been saved.<br /><br />What is certain is that all of the people who died in Deighton's masterpiece were either innocent and blameless or just doing their duty irrespective of which side they were on. Our society, raised on images of Bhagdad suffering Shock and Awe should read 'Bomber' before we plunge headlong into another war. It is a frightening yet sobering read.[[ASIN:1453713700 That Will Do Nicely]]
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This game brings me back to old school tactics games as in back to famicom. The game is easy to play and features all the things I look for in a pay game. Personal favorite right here. I think this is by far the best game on the android devices. But I only say that because I like these games specifically.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great summer read! Took this book to Hawaii and once I started it, couldn't put it down. Love it when there are twists and turns in a novel - not your generic story line by any means. Would recommend this book for anyone looking for an intriguing story line.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Purchased this box set for my husband, and it's great, lots of little extras, and getting the whole show in one set (on sale, too) was so much cheaper than buying the seasons individually. The box is bulky, but nothing that you absolutely have to keep if you don't have the space for it.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I bought this headset based on the positive reviews on Amazon, but I did not once read about a problem with the wireless connection on this headset.<br /><br />My headset is constantly loosing its wireless connection and then picking it back up while in use.  When this happens you hear a Beep in your headset and then the sound goes silent.  About 3-5 seconds later, the unit will reconnect to its wireless adapter.<br /><br />Not only is this defective and annoying.  It's a real problem if you are in the middle of your gaming session, barking orders in vent and trying to listen to your teammates.
030758836X|5.0|loved this book, took it to the pool with me this summer, and I did more reading than swimming. Thought the characters where great, with lots of twisty turns. was not a big fan of the ending,, but so many possibilities I think Flynn picked the wrong one.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I updated my review of this.  The full version is now available!!  It came out around 8/27.<br /><br />The graphics are great.  I'm on level 147 and the description says there are 130 levels.<br /><br />It's a lot of fun decorating your aquariums (you have 3 to use) and 'buying' fish and equipment with points you earn playing the match 3 part of the game.  It's like SIMS for aquariums.<br /><br />Like all great match 3 games, they become more difficult as you move through the levels.<br /><br />The fish swim in your aquarium.  It is so neat to see them.  It looks real.  Every once in a while a fish will have a bubble over its head to show you it wants something, such as another fish or a decoration.  Watch for this.<br /><br />You also need to balance your fish purchases with aquarium supplies, such as food and light, and environment items such as plants.<br /><br />Highly recommended but beware its very addictive.  Well worth the $5.

B000E5N62U|3.0|Let me start by saying I love Kamikiriad and Nightfly which I listen to regularly to this day.  This is NOT either of those two.  MTC sounds like it came from the same sessions as TAN which I was not a fan of.  Becker's guitar playing just doesn't do it for me for more than the rare contribution.  There's also only so much of that upbeat tempo of Brite Nitegown a person can take.  A few songs are pretty good....you'll know which ones I mean.

B005F82X48|5.0|I really like this album, the music and what the band stands for. These days it is so difficult to find music that is not corporate rock made from some formula (e.g. nickelback, bush) that I can feel good about allowing my 12 year old daughter to listen to. The music has an edge and the lyrics are positive and relevant. My wife and I listen to this as well as my daughter. I highly recommend this album.
B005J7K964|5.0|I have just about worn out the vinyl LP of Georgio Moroder's Metropolis I bought almost 30 years ago - fantastic music by some 80's legends.  And I haven't seen the version combined with this music since our local VHS store finally closed down in the 1990's.  To me, the Moroder music is the only soundtrack for Metropolis - the other vintage or classical soundtracks released over the years, just don't do it for me.  Can't wait for it to be shipped!!  I may have a retro silver pants, lava lamp and fondue party to celebrate !!

B004LWZW6U|5.0|One thing you will have to take in mind is that reviewers dont seem to take into mind that some movies were ment to be seen as awful and cheesy fun. Piranha 3DD does that and I thought very well. They had some great cameos like they did in the first one. The plot while very plain and bland was still enough to keep the movie going for me atleast. I saw this on the PS3 network in 3d and i have to admit I really dont know what some of these reviewers are talking about. This movie had a lot of fun 3D in it. I can think of atleast 15-18 scenes that has some really great pop outs and felt there was a good natural depth through most of the movie. Trust me when I say that I am a 3D nut and in no way will you be disappointed getting the 3d verson of the film.<br /><br />If you like cheesy horror movies like I do and love a fun 3D playground with it, i really dont think you can go wrong with Piranhas 3DD, Ofcourse I would also recomend you see the original  Piranha 3d as well.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Watchmen is the ultimate comic and its well directed by Snyder. I highly recommend to read the comic book first. Snyder arranged the actors just perfectly so that there is no missing points. If you like this type don't miss it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Ok, I admit it. A lot of laughs were had. This was probably one of my favorite reads of the year. The blunt honesty makes you want to shake her silly and hug her all at the same time. I honestly can't say much more because I will only keep saying how wonderful it was. As with all book there were slow parts, but that doesn't weight on my feelings for this story.
B002AFX52S|5.0|As always Kurosawa made something more beyond than any other directors. This one deserves this remaster by Criterion and I'm happy to see that. I highly recommend this as its very valuable and have a point of view the way you never see before.
B007MJ9LA2|4.0|First the good news: this is the best Santana album since Supernatural.  Of course Supernatural cannot be compared to the classic first three albums, but it is the album that brought Santana back in the spotlight and to a new generation of listeners, and allowed him to put out instrumental projects like Shape shifter.  Of course, comparing anything to the awful Guitar heaven album is not saying much...<br /><br />The bad news: the current Santana band line up is the weakest to date, especially in the area of drums, bass and keyboards.  Considering the shoes that they have to fill (Michael Shrieve, Leon Chancler and Graham Lear for drums, David Brown and David Margen for bass, Gregg Rolie and Tom Coster on keys), it is not an easy job, but it has been done countless times before without missing a beat.  These current guys play like sidekicks afraid of stepping on Carlos' toes.  The bass mix is so muddy that you can hardly pick it out, just this rumbling in the background.  And then the bass lines on most songs is SO BORING (single root notes) that it feels like some amateur, even though Benny Retveld is certainly capable technically of doing better (I saw him live).  Dennis Chambers is incapable of putting out the polyrhythms that his predecessors were churning out (listen to Graham's\\" heads hands and feet\\" solo).  What Carlos should do is just fire Dennis and hire his wife Cindy Blackman instead.  I saw her live and BOY can she put out some fine drumming from a very stripped down set.  I don't even know who is on keyboards nowadays, but all he can do at best is faithfully reproduce his predecessors' solos, not much imagination otherwise.<br /><br />If you listen to classic Santana, you will hear this ongoing interplay between bass, drums and keys layered upon the percussion bedrock that is the Santana sound.  This is mostly missing in this album except for maybe Canela, the 12th track.  Percussion does not even show up until Macumba, 2/3 of the way into the album.<br /><br />I do not think it is an ego thing, since throughout his career, Carlos has always surrounded himself with excellent players, and he thrives on what the other musicians put out and then takes it a step further.  Listen to the album by Abraxas Pool, which is essentially the original Santana band minus Carlos, and you will not hear much difference between that and what Carlos puts out.  So I would put the onus on the current band members to step up to the plate or get out of the way.<br /><br />The Native American theme is pretty idiotic because Carlos cannot pull off something like that.  Carlos can do Latin, he can do Jazz, he can do Inspirational but he can't do World Music even though he keeps trying on stage and failing.  Listen to him play reggae in tribute to his idol Bob Marley and you know what I mean.  The opening indian chants would have offended me if I were a Native American because it is so dreadfully cliché.<br /><br />So what this album could be is Santana's Adult Contemporary Album.  If you give it a chance and listen to the latter half of the album with a date, if you haven't scored by the end of the night then either she is tone deaf or you are butt ugly.  Hey the guy is getting old, Carlos is allowed to have a mellow album if he chooses to do so, and let's give him a break and encourage him to continue putting out his own music instead of these crappy hip hop collaborations.  What Carlos needs to do is start a new band with musicians that can also write and then he can take us to the real guitar heaven...

B007J4T2G8|2.0|After hearing all the hype about this book on TV, seeing it in magazines and plastered elsewhere in the media, I figured this couldn't be TOO horrible of a book. It is. The main characters are very shallow. Christian Grey - disgustingly arrogant, unrealistically good looking, rich, cocky, controlling hunk. Anastasia Steele - clumsy, plain, self-conscious girl who throws herself - and her virginity - at the feet of a man she just met. Why? Because he's just oh so dreamy, of course. I gave up on the book when my Kindle told me I had read 33%. To me, if a book is still so unbelievable uninteresting 33% into it, it's not worth my time when I could be reading Stephen King. I would recommend watching porn over reading 50 Shades of Grey.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|For anyone interested in acting as a craft, Philip Seymour Hoffman as coach Art Howe steals the show, with Jonah Hill as Peter Brand doing an amazing job of creating Brad Pitt's statistical analyst and assistant. Brad Pitt as the Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane gives an excellent performance but, like any Hollywood superstar, he never really stops being himself. Hoffman by comparison plays the Oakland A's coach to the point of losing himself in his character; we don't see Hoffman playing Howe, we see Art Howe. (Or at least a film character called Art Howe. The real life Howe doesn't like how he is portrayed in the film or the book.) The film offers a good example of the difference between excellent performing (Pitt) and excellent acting (Hoffman) and this would be enough to really like this film.<br /><br />But for a film lover there's more. Most of the dialogue is natural with very few dramatic one-liners; for tension, the director relies more on understated exchanges filled with the empty words that make up the conversations all of us have in daily life. There isn't much incidental music to artificially create moods, again the director relies on natural effects. If French director Eric Rohmer had ever directed a commercial American film, this is what he would have done. But don't let this scare you-- Moneyball isn't an art house film, it's a commercial film made with a few techniques borrowed from minimalist avant-garde directors.<br /><br />Another pleasant surprise is that I liked the movie better than I liked the book, even though I loved the book and read it years before seeing the movie. Maybe it's because I had no expectations this would ever be made into a movie, or if it did that it would be made into a documentary. Instead, director Bennett Miller did what Philip Kaufman did with Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff: he took a factual book and turned it into a dramatic film.<br /><br />One word of warning: sport fans might find themselves disappointed at seeing players and plays relegated to the background of a story focused on numbers, statistics, and economics. But that is the point of the movie; where traditionalists argue that baseball is a human game involving hunches, intuition, performance and tense dramatic field plays, the film argue that results come from more abstract considerations. Baseball is really about thinking.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Montrealeeing players and plays relegated to the background of a story focused on numbers, statistics, and economics.

1469984202|5.0|Wow!  What a great story.  I found Howey's Wool Omnibus after I read and reviewed [[ASIN:161218362X Containment]].  Amazon's \\"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\\" is to blame! The price for the five Wool books (as an Omnibus series) was way too low for the quality of science fiction provided.  In the same spirit and classic theme of dystopian stories like Orwell's 1984, and moving forward, modern and recent stories like The Hunger Games, Wool is the story of a world gone wrong.  A world where people know little and continue their lives both in that ignorance and hope for the future.  A world that is both expansive and confining, providing both mundane routine and mysterious details as the story progresses.<br /><br />The writing style and descriptive language is very readable and focuses on character development backed with simultaneous individual stories which allow the reader to piece together what is going on.  The story unfolds in a way where you learn a critical point (the first 10 pages reveal this style perfectly), then the reader can wonder how that came to be, and work towards the origin of that point.  Things are revealed at just the right pace, leaving you wanting for more while turning the pages, and really leaving few stones unturned. This makes for that page turning-\\"gotta stay up late\\" quality that I love when immersed in a great story. The story does take about 100 pages to get to that point, and those first pages want and need to be read, but the initial pace quickly picks up leaving a sense of not being able to turn pages fast enough.  This pacing may leave the reader surprised and satisfied at the same time.<br /><br />At this point after getting to read all five Wool books in a week rather than months, I can only imagine having to wait for the release of the next book during the initial publication of each book in 2011 and into 2012--as each book leaves you wanting more and unwilling to wait.  Even here at the end of book five of Wool, more is wanted.  That leaves \\"First Shift-Legacy\\" [[ASIN:1475154771 First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series)]] as book six of the Wool silo series, which is more of a prequel with a new set of characters (purchased and cued up!). The title plays on what a reader already has learned from the first five Wool stories.<br /><br />Of course, waiting is not what you get with the Omnibus edition; you get all five of the books in one... and at a great price that is NOT reflective of what you reading.  Each of these books is worth the $5+ price that would total $25+ for the entire series if purchased separately--and I bet in the initial publication and for the relative anonymity of Hugh Howey, pricing might have been a barrier, especially without a hard publication along with the electronic versions.  The price was definitely something that made me interested in giving Wool a try--and now I am thinking I did not spend enough for the satisfaction gained.  To make up for it, I am buying the rest of what this author has to offer on Amazon.<br /><br />Wool is not a science and technology driven story, although the ecosystem is a technological and self contained marvel.  Wool is a story of a dystopian future that provides a sense of dread and claustrophobia, while dangling the carrot of freedom at well paced intervals. Wool is the story of human beings with their weaknesses, strengths, and in a sense of classic story telling, of how one individual can infect others with ideas that are both dangerous and liberating.  In short, classic sci-fi.<br /><br />Hugh Howey has a wonderful story telling capacity and hopefully has lots more to write in a productive career, while exposing readers to provocative, mind expanding, and thoughtful ideas in an entertaining and lively style.  Highly recommended.  Buy everything!e is wanted.

B004SBULWE|5.0|this app saves a TON of battery, allowing me to use it for much longer than usual! it also allows me to kill apps if I'm not going to use this device for the time being.
0893860468|5.0|Several years ago I was introduced to a remarkable book, \\"I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj,\\" by a fellow seeker. I was in search of a guru who could help me understand \\"who am I,\\" \\"how do I relate to the world and the vice-versa,\\" \\"the cause of human suffering,\\" and \\"the meaning of free will.\\" I searched in vain answers to these and host of related questions in bookstores specializing in books on spirituality. My search ended with the Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj's \\"I Am That\\" -- truly a spiritual classic. It opened up new vistas to understanding the riddle of life. His message is simple and free from esoteric jargon of pseudo gurus. \\"I Am That\\" second revised edition issued in August 2012 is printed in a new format, re-copyedited and re-typeset. It's a marked improvement over the previous printings with black and yellow covers. I would strongly recommend this book, especially the 2nd revised edition, to the students of Vedanta. Maharaj helps you understand the nature of the world and \\"I am\\" in the most simple and convincing words.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I was totally obsessed with this book while reading it. I couldn't wait to find out what really happened. Great ending.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Once you get past the first couple of chapters, it starts to get interesting and then it becomes a very adult love story.The story revolves around Christina Gray and his \\"Fifty Shades \\"  and  I  think that  we ( female) can all relate to some part of the\\" Fifty shades\\"!<br />It is easy reading, easy to imagine what is happening and easy to escape into a world of pleasure and money! One we all would like to be able to enjoy or just fantisise about. Definately worth a read, if nothing else to be able to say that you have read it and you would be able to comment on it!!!!
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Perfect read for a vacation. It was a hard book to put down. I didn't want the story to end.
0375826726|5.0|I received this book very fast and in perfect condition. The pages were not bend or ruined at all nor was the cover or the cover art. Couldn't be happier with this transaction. A+++
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book. Not a slow chapter in it. As soon as I finished it I started reading another one of her books, \\"Dark Places\\". It was just as good or even better.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Super easy to use and read. And it's handy as well. I love that I can use my kindle fire for nearly everything...math included!!!!! It truly is as easy as Pi to use.

034580404X|4.0|The writing is not the greatest but it hooks you in. Once you start, you need to know how it all unfolds.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Provides great fun entertainment solo. Cant wait to try multiplayer. I will be playing this for hours.<br /> Try it, you wont be disappointed.
B008KW43TE|5.0|Frank Ocean is my favorite artist in the R&B/Hip-Hop/Soul/PsychedelicRock/Blues/Electronic/WhateverGenreHeChoosesToFill in the game right now.  His stories are thought provoking, his voice gives my spine chills, and the melodies are catchy.  DEFINITELY an album you should purchase.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This was a replacement cable for my Kindle Fire and I received it a timely manor. I was very impressed with customer service.
B004ZN9OTG|5.0|I love this album, but...<br />This recording has always lacked sufficient high frequencies. In fact, the bootleg of PF playing with the LP Orchestra from a BBC broadcast is by far the superior recording.<br />Apparently during the re-mastering process, the low frequencies have been enhanced as opposed to the much lacking high frequencies. This I'll never understand.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is so cool! I just love it the people who say this game not fun are stupid and don't know what a good game is but add me when u install: babycakez147 :)
B00005QGAT|5.0|Well, it's been 33 years since Off The Wall has been released. The album itself makes it unique, by expanding different genres of music-Disco, Pop, R&B, Adult Contemporary & Dance- throughout the entire album from beginning to end. Here is the breakdown of each of the songs that I, in my opinion had reviewed on.<br /><br />1. Don't stop til you get enough: 9.5/10-this is the song that put his solo career as an adult into superstardom, and it is number one for all the right reasons.<br /><br />2. Rock with you: 10/10-my favorite song from the album. It is a love ballad with a combination of Disco & Dance blend in.<br /><br />3. Workin' day and night: 10/10-an underrated track penned by Michael, himself.<br /><br />4. Get on the floor: 9/10-it has an incredible beat throughout the song. It has a Saturday Night Fever style to it.<br /><br />5. Off the wall:10/10-another incredible dance song.<br /><br />6. Girlfriend: 8.5/10-written by Sir Paul McCartney. It sounds innocent yet guilty.<br /><br />7. She's out of my life: 10/10-Oh. My. Goodness. How can you listen to this, and not respond? It is emotional with a touch of sadness & loneliness. in the end, you can actually hear him break down and cry.<br /><br />8. I can't help it: 9.5/10- an excellent song done by Stevie Wonder. This should have been a hit, but unfortunately, it did not.<br /><br />9. It's the falling in love: 10/10-A fantastic duet with Patti Austin. It is a mid-tempo love song that is danceable.<br /><br />10. Burn this Disco Out: 10/10- an incredible song that completes the album, that symbolizes the end of the disco generation.<br /><br />The special edition of the album contains interviews with producers Quincy Jones & Rod Temperton. It also has two demos of \\"Workin' day and night\\" & \\"Don't stop til you get enough\\" that features Mike, Randy & Janet.<br /><br />Overall, one of MJ's best albums. The style of the album varies along with the songwriters & producers. Off The Wall has truly aged well and stood the test of time. If someone to ask me, \\"What is your favorite Michael Jackson Album?\\" This would be my pick because it is well-crafted.stood the test of time. If someone to ask me, \\"What is your favorite Michael Jackson Album?\\" This would be my pick because it is well-crafted.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Its a good app to own when you're in school, particularly in grades higher than seventh. It shows you in the photos that you can design it, but you can't unless you go pro. However, you don't really need to design it, so its pretty good.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Thank you so much for having pinterest for my kindle fire!  I can now enjoy my obsession...... even at school or at the coffee shop!
B005K17RU0|3.0|doesn't seem to be that accurate whither the forecast. I like the radar map, but I wish there were more maps. sometimes the ads slow the app down.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I bought this after downloading the b/w version, and love it. There are regular updates, so I never run out of puzzles. Highly recommend!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Reading is a new hobby for me & although I like mystery & intrigue, I look for books to read that  don't have r-rated vocabulary.  Defending Jacob was just that, well written & kept me reading.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|Well folks this is the last Batman movie for a while. i thought that this final conclusion to the dark knight was awesome. i really loved this movie. i will say this it was not as good as the dark knight, but it was still awesome. i was glad to see that they put Bane in this movie, that was a good toch. i thought that tom hardy was a great bane, he was not what i expected Bane to be i was looking for the bane who pumped venom into his veins to become huge and destroy batman. but this version of bane was really good. i thought that they could of done without catwoman. she really didn't need to be in this film. Catwoman was done well enough in batman returns. i mean an hathaway did a good job. but they didn't have the batman/catwoman flirtation like it is in the comics and tv show. and they nevfer fought once and she wasn't even called catwoman in the whole movie. so far that is two villians christopher nolan messed up with. two-face and catwoman. don't get me wrong his movies are good. but you do not put two major supervillians in one movie if you can't concentrate on them. Batman returns is a great example on having two major bad guys and concetrating on both. But i'm glad that they did the whole break batman down and have him rise feel in it. i;m not going to lie i loved this movie that was just some of my little quricks. i was happy with it and with the ending now maybe dc can do justice league since they had the ending the way they did. if you have not seen this movie i recommend you do

Anyone reminiscing about your old NES days yet? Seriously, I like the game, and it's partly because of and partly in spite of the fact that it reminds me so much of Super Mario Bros. It runs smoothly &amp;plays well. Lots'o'fun for everyone.

B005Y5L2WG|5.0|Vampire Diaries is utterly the best in Vampire series Ive ever watched.  It even beats Angel and Buffy, never thought Id be sayin that as I am an Angel freak..Its more of a romance than Angel.  Lots of action, and not to much gore.  I love this series and hope it continues longer than the Angel series.  It compares closly with Twilight..have to wait too long for the continuation with that one.  Total thumbs up for this one!  Thanks to All the cast.  Lyn
0060574216|4.0|This is a deeply insightful book. It has helped me to a deeper knowledge of how miscommunication, misinterpretation, and simple misunderstandings can build over time, and slowly destroy relationships if left unchecked. I applied some of the knowledge in this book when interacting with a female roommate, and the bottom line is, it works. The information contained is the result of thousands of mediated marital counseling sessions, so the author is able to hone in on the very core of what men and women want, and how they differ in communication styles. A key theme that runs throughout the book is to never make assumptions, because this leads to misinterpretations of your partner's intentions, which leads to anger, changing to long term resentment. This book is for those of you who want to proactively make a difference in your present and future relationships, and is a step back from blaming your partner, and a step towards taking responsibility and changing what you have the power to change. Ultimately, I think this knowledge has benefited me most in helping me to be less closed off, and more open/honest in sharing my feelings and perceptions. As someone who is used to making assumptions, I now realize how wrong and destructive some of my past assumptions have been, and how to constructively work through conflict to help future relationships experience continued growth.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Fun quick game.  Easy to carry, and learn.  It's also easy to modify the rules to change up the game.  Must have for every game collection.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|That this HOLY WORD of the LIVING ETERNAL GOD would be free is beyond belief. I THANK MY LORD JESUS CHRIST for HIS LONG-SUFFERRING & ENDURANCE denying the temptations of the devil in the wilderness after giving up eating for 40 days (who can accomplish this feat? I struggle giving up eating for a few hours...this is one of a literal billion reasons why God DESERVES ALL PRAISE, GLORY, & HONOR) because without it I would never get to experience this NEW LIFE living in His LOVE. I THANK THE BEAUTIFUL HOLY SPIRIT OF ALMIGHTY GOD FOR HIS PATIENCE WITH ME EVEN THOUGH I WAS FAR BEYOND DESERVING & RECEIVING HIS GRACE, MERCY, & LOVE! HALLELUJAH. HOLY HOLY HOLY IS THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY WHO WAS AND IS AND IS TO COME!

B008DNNX6O|3.0|As a longtime fan of DCD, I had very high hopes for this album.  However, it really sounds like a Brendan Perry solo album awkwardly stitched to a Lisa Gerrard solo album.  The individual parts are well-crafted for the most part, but the creative synergy that infused earler DCD albums is gone.  So literally, the parts are greater than their sum.
B000OVLBIU|4.0|The first Ghost rider movie was good and had plenty of action with good fighting against evil and all that rot. It was a nice movie and I really enjoyed Nicolas Cage's acting.
B004UID2LC|5.0|best ever my kids love it. it is good to me to get it<br /> I rate five stars best game ever
B005LAIGWS|1.0|I didn't really watch the movie to rate it. I got a blank disc when I put it in the bluray player there was no picture. I checked the HDMMI cable several times to make sure it wasn't that but each time it registered that it was good. Most of the movies I get from Amazon are good but this soured me alittle.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I had my kindle plugged in because it was almost dead but then I played it and went on online browser and itsaid warning ten percent of battery left then it went to the app. I closed it and then it opened automatically in less than four seconds.

B000PMGS8G|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years but it was referenced several times in the recent comedy movie Ted. (Ted itself I found hillarious) Sure this Flash Gordon movie is cheesy but it was meant to be. It is defineatly up there on the list of 80's cult movies with the likes of fast Times at Ridgemont High, The Breakfast Club, and Footloose. The quality of the DVD is excellent and I highly recommend owning a copy of it.[[ASIN:B000PMGS8G Flash Gordon: Saviour Of The Universe Edition]]
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is easy to use and easy to read. It works great on my Kindle Fire, and it is convenient.  I like the large display, and the fact that it shows previous calculations until I choose to erase them.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|Profoundly boring. The trailers showed the only action in the movie, and even that was unremarkable. I don't even recommend renting it. Alien Nation was infinitely better as a comparison.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Where do I begin? I started looking for a book that was different from all the other books I have been reading lately. I was captured instantly by the title of the book and the description of the characters, Lake and Will, and thought why not. It was beyond my expectations. It was happy, sad, thrilling, edgy, and capturing so much so I had to read the second book, Point of Retreat, which I read in one day. Both books did not only make me crave more, it made me look at life. It is amazing how the author captured and kept the main theme throughout the book. It inspires me to continue to have the same love that Lake and Will have for one another in my own life. This book was not only inspirational but meaningful. I highly recommend reading the second book Point of Retreat. It was even better than the first one. Its from Will point of view and they face even more challenges.<br />Lake is a rising senior in high school when her world starts crumbling around her.  Her father dies unexpectedly and they have to move from the only home she and her brother have ever known. They move to Michigan, a place far different from her birth place, where its colder. They move to a nice neighborhood when she meets a good looking boy from across the street named, Will. She found things in common with Will, the death of a parent. For Will though, he had both parents pass away. Immediately sparks fly and she views things differently about Michigan. They find they cant be away from each other when one day their worlds fall apart.<br />Together they face challenges with not only their heart but life.<br />Hope you all enjoy this amazing book that has captured my heart and see life differently.

0060786523|4.0|A book equal to Hugo in quotable quotes. My favorite quote among many to choose from: `Do not let the bee enter the garden that the moth may not be unjustly killed.'<br /><br />On the author Vikram Seth: What he does to the color of a character is what Victor Hugo does to color a scene. Each compels you to read and re-read their works just for shear enjoyment of the mosaic of words; paintings upon the readers mind. There comes a point where the reader could care little for the plot as he is pleasantly lost in the picture. The following is an example of quips of drama, romance and humor that barely scratches the surface in representing my point.<br /><br />* For the most part he treated the patient audience to a speech of exceptional banality. He soared and veered over a vast terrain, and assumed that his droppings would make an intelligible pattern<br />* Said the professor to the nephew , \\"economics, such a wasted subject. When are you going to switch subjects?\\" The nephew's reply, \\"I can't\\". \\"Why not\\" retorted the Uncle. \\"I already graduated.\\"<br />* For a man who in his friendships and acquaintances looked upon religion and nationality as both significant and irrelevant...<br />* The joke about super human phenomena and 50 women sitting under a tree perfectly silent<br /><br />As far as plot goes, this book does a masterful job in tying a Gordian Knot with strains of love, religion, family, politics, international business and then spends one lakh, (a thousand) pages drawing in tension based on loves' intrigue. What is read on page one will be pulled through to page thirteen hundred and fifty. While the prime question...to finish this review and look at the prime question, please do a search on cigarroomofbooks, A Suitable Boy.  Enjoy
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|I was impressed by the portrait the author delivers on women'virtues, which are magnified against all injustices they have to fight.<br />Their persistence to defend the true values of life, without forgetting its practical  implications

1469984202|3.0|This Omnibus has been getting so much buzz that I figured I had to try it out.  Having finished it all I can say is that I just don't get it.  It's decent at best.  The future world building isn't anything amazing by genre standards, the plot is okay but nothing fabulously intricate, the drama is weak aside from a few genuinely tense moments.  Characterization is decidedly inferior for all but the main character, who doesn't even play a big part until the third installment.  The moral dilemas were pretty shallow as well.<br /><br />All in all an enjoyable but overrated story.  Not in the same league as works by Sci Fi greats like Heinlein, Herbert, LeGuin, Wolfe or Butler.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I didn't think such a game could exist on the Android platform. Even now, after spending HOURS with the game I still only barely scratched the surface. UniWar HD is like a great turn based strategy game of old, focusing on combat and base capture. While there is no diplomacy or other advanced options here, the game is still outstanding.<br /><br />The premise of this app is both simple and complex. You have to take over the map by eliminating your opponents (up to EIGHT players at the same time) and capturing their (or neutral) bases. You must carefully use the units at your disposal to outmaneuver and gang up on your enemies, destroying them mercilessly. By taking these bases you will be awarded with more money each turn, allowing you to build more units, and laugh manically as your army rolls over the competition. If you do your job, you will crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentation of their women.<br /><br />There are three races in the game: The Kraleans, The Sapiens, and The Titans. Each race has completely unique units (eight of them) with different strengths, weakness, and abilities. The races are extremely well balanced, although my personal favorite so far are the Sapiens (Humans). I won't tell you why, because I think it will spoil your discovery moments with the game, which I also found fun.<br /><br />The graphics and sound here are as good as they need to be for a TBS game. The hexes are adequate enough to represent the terrain you are on and the units look good. The sound effects and music are also very satisfying. My only wish is that units and tiles were a bit more animated. While units do fidget from time to time, and there are attack (and base) animations - the tiles themselves are very bland. Spicing these up will go a long way because players spend a lot of their time staring at them.<br /><br />UniWar HD really is the complete package. There are plenty of options, including a very detailed Help option that will inform you on some of the more advanced tactics of the game. I suggest you go through it (or the campaign first) before jumping online because they will go over such things as medical bases, gang up bonuses, repairing, special abilities, etc. I made the mistake of venturing online first and got utterly annihilated (within a minute).<br /><br />Speaking of online mode, this is where the game shines. Up to eight players can play simultaneously, and you can have multiple games going while you wait for them to make their move (I advise against this until you have a better grasp of the game).<br />You can play anonymously or make an account, I suggest you sign up with UniWar for the sake of record keeping. Feel free to give them bogus info if you are concerned about privacy.<br />Using this account you can check detailed statistics on your wins, losses, ladder position, etc. Very cool and handy!<br /><br />If online is not your cup of tea, you can play against the AI and/or the excellent campaign which actually has a somewhat interesting story.<br />There is also the wonderful vs. mode, where you can play against your friends on the same phone (think hotseat option from PC TBS games). It's a great feature that gives UniWar HD a lot more bang for the buck.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this game. I absolutely love that they didn't use spyware infested junkware like OpenFeint or Scoreloop. Everything (such as scorekeeping, progression, leader boards, etc) is handled in-game here, so there are no unnecessary permissions. Good job devs!<br /><br />If I knew such a game existed, I would gladly pay full price for it. While steep at $4.99, it is very, very worth it if you at all enjoy turn based strategy games. This is quite simply the best FAOTD that Amazon has had in a while.<br />Go ahead and download it while it's free, and buy it if it's not. This game is amazing and will provide you with countless hours of entertainment (there are thousands of maps and theonline community is HUGE).
0375507256|1.0|Mitchell bamboozled us all. I don't care that the author is talented or has a great track record, or that two of the stories seem complex in this so-called novel, or that all of the stories seem totally unrelated but promise to be part of a masterful brilliant earth-shattering revelation. Because they're simply unrelated stories linked together with a rather cheap gimmick. Actually--unless you're already sold on all the gushing reviews, you start to realize halfway through that it's probably not going to be as \\"masterfully woven\\" together as you thought it would be. Once the narrative goes in reverse and you realize that wait--the only thing that links some of the totally unrelated characters is a birthmark (woo woo)--and wait--the supposed meta quality of some of them feels not smart/deft/devised, but rather, totally inauthentic (oh, one hilariously comedic monologue is *really* a masterful film from ages past that has been dug out of a vault but says nothing about anything else in the book!) or (oh! the mind-numbingly dull, meandering, and utterly unnecessary diary was published and found on the shelf of a random house in another story!)...etc etc...I tried to suspend belief and just trust Mitchell, but after a certain point, you find that trust was unearned and has panned out to be undeserved.<br /><br />I'd like to know if Mitchell claims to have conceived of these stories as a whole. Because in the end, it seems clear that he wrote a number of them as short stories--or had these disparate ideas--and then thought, oho, I could link them together with a few artificial devices and everyone would think it so complex they would be sure that it's a work of genius! I'd almost rather that he went back and artificially tried to connect them with more intent and a sense of necessity. Like I said, I did initially enjoy half the stories (the sci-fi tale of a clone in a futuristic Korea--not original at all, but interesting/well-written; the said comedic monologue, which was random and completely unbelievable but was redeemed by an absolutely hilarious narration; and the string of letters from a narcissistic but interesting musician--even if the story itself was pointless and self-indulgent), and hung in there assuming it would all start to become the bigger picture promised in the form. I even believed that the 'voice-throwing' stock spy novel story would pan out into something and so I read in good faith. I thought the post-apocalyptic story at the fulcrum would be something important (in spite of its total failure at ventriloquism and that the characterization was flat-out embarrassing and even ironic in the light of Mitchell's final sermon)--so I read in good faith.<br /><br />All that to say, I felt conned by the time I got to the last segment as soon as it became clear that even the slightest elegant connection that would show actual complex thought and purpose was not going to happen. And as that final dreary narrative of randomness (the diary-format story) came to its final heavy-handed, hollow moralizing conclusion, all I could say was \\"Seriously?!\\" Looking back at its parts, the whole thing falls apart. A savvy writer has proved that the world is easily won over by the sheen of superficial talent even in the absence of substance. You can write papers about its supposed themes and its 'brilliant' form all you want, but the story breaks down. I know many vehemently disagree and argue that I'm missing his crafty craft, but I'm not gonna lie and say I think a book that's 50% well-written prose is deserving of praise. There's plenty of well-written prose out there. I want a good story, and I don't think that's too much to ask for.<br /><br />***UPDATE*** Re: Tom Tykwer adaptation<br />If you've already read this book and hated it for similar reasons, thought I'd mention you might actually enjoy the film. Because basically Tom Tykwer, who understands storytelling, has projected his own meaning and connections into the narrative that are totally *not* present in the book (particularly by using the same actors in each segment, thereby suggesting a more sci-fi or mystical connection between characters that is non-existent in the book). Which is why he's succeeded in improving the story by leaps (not leaps and bounds, but sure, I'd vote for leaps) because it's actually cohesive by way of that visual character mechanism as well as really good editing.<br /><br />Which goes to show that if Mitchell had gone back and tried to analyze his stories as a whole and weave in some superficial but logical connections, he could have come out with a far more cohesive novel. To underscore this, I've observed most people who watched the movie first and then read the book projecting the film's connections into the book--so they come to each story already feeling like they know and believe in the connections between the characters.at are totally *not* present in the book (particularly by using the same actors in each segment, thereby suggesting a more sci-fi or mystical connection between characters that is non-existent in the book).

B0012CH350|5.0|This cover fits well, is well made, and does a great job protecting my grill from the weather.<br /><br />Weber sells two types of covers, the black one which is heavy duty and meant for direct weather and the elements.  especially here in the Northeast where the winters can get pretty rough.  Sometimes.<br /><br />The second cover is more of a lighter weight cover and is gray in color.  It is good for a place that has milder winters, or for a grill that you want to cover that is already on a covered deck or carport.  I have used the gray covers during some hard winters, and they start to look their age after some time while the black covers hold up much better in tougher conditions.<br /><br />Both covers end about 6-8 inches from the ground.  This gives good air circulation for the covered grill so any condensation will dry off during the day.

034580404X|5.0|I had heard that this trilogy was \\"mommy porn\\". It really DOES have a lot of explicit sex in it, but it is TRULY a love story. So...if you are offended by explicit sex DO NOT purchase this trilogy!!!!!!<br /><br />Christian had a very troubled childhood with his biological mother. I think that the Grey's adoption saved his life. It is pretty sickening thinking about \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" taking advantage of a 15 year old boy, but it's part of the storyline and I'm CERTAIN that it happens more often than not in real life.<br /><br />Anastasia is portrayed as a very kind and loving soul. Christian's background breaks her heart, but she deals with it really well!!!! I am not quite finished with the last book, but I am sooooooo excited to finish it!!!!!. I think that this is a MUST READ for anyone that enjoys a good love story, and this is a GREAT love story!!!!!!!!! Bravo to E.L. James for such a well written trilogy!!!!!
0374203032|3.0|This is a casually written book full of observations and commentary, but no real arguments or deep reasoning. Sandel discusses the various ways markets have come to allocate goods and services that were previously free from market influences. Sandel categorizes the main objections to the increased role of markets as either unfairness or corruption. Sandel himself though never takes any definitive stands and is content to use the \\"some say..., but others say...\\" style of writing to report viewpoints rather than adopt any. Fittingly, the last two sentences of the book are unanswered questions. This lack of conviction from a noted philosopher plus the repeated use of similar examples makes for very light reading on what should have been an interesting topic.

This is has been one of my favorite series ever :)
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Having read most of Stephen King's bibliography, I find that the Bachman books stick with me the most. The Long Walk is a compelling, if exhausting, read. The book is easily one of King's best, and the haunting images of it will linger with you long after you finish it. It beats the pants off The Hunger Games in terms of immersing the reader in the chilling terror faced by young adults who are forced to their deaths under the guise of tradition.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|As an avid reader with a monstrous love for dystopian novels, people have incessantly recommended this book to me over the past few years. The premise intrigued me, and I eagerly anticipated the \\"Lord of the Flies\\" style Hunger Games. As I began the book, I found my interest and excitement waning as the narrative fell into the predictable and manufactured rut that plagues so many YA novel series.<br /><br />My biggest issues were with the ambiguity of the dystopia that provided too few explanations for my taste. Every sentence and description of Panem and the structure of the government had to be taken at face value and left me with a thousand questions that remained unanswered. My other problem was with the character of Katniss. As a female who grew up in an isolated town surrounded by wilderness and poverty, I thought I would instantly relate with her character. This wasn't the case. I found her nearly inaccessible and felt that her personality and character traits shifted constantly to suit the novel's overall narrative.<br /><br />I think it's an excellent read for middle-school-aged children, but the material doesn't hold enough themes or thought-provoking ideas to hold the interests of an older, more thoughtful reader. I would definitely recommend it for younger readers, though it may be too simplistic for others who are well-versed in the sci-fi/fantasy genre.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless is a must read for any father.  The story of Adam brown is a riveting account of a Navy Seal who had a great family, lost his way, and then found his way to Christ.  He was a guy who turned his life around from being a drug addict to a Navy Seal who served our country honorably.  On top of being a Navy Seal, Adam was a great family man who loved his kids.<br /><br />As a father this book challenged me to cherish the time I have with my children and make sure I make the most of every moment.  This book is a great book for the father who sees his job as more important than his family as it will bring better perspective to life.<br /><br />The story of Adam Brown the soldier is incredible.  It is incredible to see the amount of obstacles that Adam had to overcome to become a part of SEAL Team Six, the most elite fighting force in the world.

The book encouraged me to never stop fighting for what I want and desire.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.

0307744434|4.0|WARNING.  SOME SPOILERS!  This is one of the most intriguing and strangest books I've ever read.  I didn't quite understand it, and I was baffled when I got to the end, but rereading certain passages, my admiration of the book grew.  It was not always an easy book to read, nor was it always entertaining, but I do appreciate the book's scope, mystery and creativity.  Indeed, Celia and Marco are normal good protagonists with little distinction from other good guys, but I enjoyed their love story.  The love story, for me, was a highlight.  It was very carefully plotted - almost three-quarters of the book were gone before they spoke, though Marco was well aware of Celia being his opponent, which is when an obsession was formed.  I would have preferred a lot more explanation.  What was so special about Poppet and Widget, and what did Isobel's charm entail?  Why exactly did Tara Burgess die - was it just a freak accident?  I thought the book murky about what schools of thought Celia and Marco were exemplifying, and I didn't completely understand the loophole they created.  I have more questions, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  Indeed, the book has some flaws, and the writing could have been more polished, although some scenes were written exceptionally well.  I applaud its most unusual concept.  High praise for something different.

0451167716|4.0|Unquestionably among the best fictional treatments of the Mafia, \\"The Godfather\\" is top-of-the-line escapist literature, as well as an invaluable companion piece to the movie (or vice versa).  There's the requisite and appropriate amount of action, but it's not excessively violent or ridiculously gory (though most of the sex scenes weren't needed and were pretty silly).  The majority of the characters have depth and are well drawn.  A notable exception is Kay Adams Corleone (Diane Keaton's colorless interpretation of Kay renders the book version of the character positively three-dimensional in comparison), and I would have much preferred it if Michael Corleone had been able to stay married to the luscious and lively Apollonia (and I'm sure he felt the same way).  The overall narrative is fine, though there are a few issues.  First, the novel is somewhat longer than it needs to be.  Book IX, for instance, while hardly lengthy, is completely unnecessary and anti-climactic.  The novel should have ended with the Hemingwayesque \\"She went back into the kitchen and wept.\\"  Also, there's an occasional problem in continuity, some stuttering, and the author sometimes loses control of his material.  But where Mario Puzo really went off track was in Book II, and indeed in any and all parts of the novel where Johnny Fontane receives more than passing notice.  After all, Fontane is at best a peripheral figure.  Why all the tedious biographical detail?  I was particularly annoyed because Fontane is clearly a fictional representation of Frank Sinatra, whom I've always detested.  He was a great singer in his prime, and he had some acting ability, but he was basically a punk and a hood wanna-be all his life.  A vulgar little creep, with a mean streak deep and wide, he tried to come across as \\"classy\\" (a quality absolutely alien to him) by wearing a tuxedo on a more or less perpetual basis.  Also, Sinatra's attitude toward and treatment of women was deplorable -- the man was a cad.  He knew, deep down, that few women would have looked at him twice (or even once) if not for his fame.  Off the top of my head, the only thing I can say in his favor is that the disgracefully forgotten boxer, Tami Mauriello, was his favorite prizefighter.  OK, enough of Fontane/Sinatra.  But I should add that a similar, although lesser, problem arises with the endlessly explored relationship of Jules Segal and Lucy Mancini -- nothing but filler.<br /><br />\\"The Godfather\\" was meant to entertain, and it succeeds in doing just that.  And it's fun connecting the dots, as it were.  By that, I mean figuring out what real-life people Puzo fictionalized -- e.g., Moe Greene is Bugsy Siegel.  Despite a few problems...recommended.

B001KTATIS|3.0|I was hoping the excellent cast would make the telling of this historical period both dynamic and educational.

The movie is a reflection of the time it was made.

B0000004UB|5.0|\\"Samantha Fox Deluxe Edition\\" contains catchy hits that are reminiscent of 80's party music.  I first became acquainted with her music around 2001 when I heard \\"I Wanna Have Some Fun\\" on an 80's compilation. Around five-six years ago one of her songs was featured on a VH1 television show and I saw her in a video featured with Swedish musician Gunther.  My husband played to me a World of Warcraft video that featured Gunther's music. I decided to get her cd from Amazon UK when I had purchased another cd and her collection came under the \\"customers also purchase\\" section.  This two cd collection turned out to be a good purchase. The first cd includes seventeen tracks, with seven of those being bonus songs.  \\"Dream City\\",\\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\", and \\"The Right Stuff\\" are some of the quirky music tunes on this cd. Disc two includes thirteen songs that are variations of remixes.  \\"Samantha Fox Deluxe Edition\\" is best for those who like 80's party music.
0375869026|4.0|I am reading this out loud to my 9 year old whose taste in reading matter is beyond her reading ability. I also grew up with a brother with a disability. I disagree with the reviewer who said it detracted from the story that there were many narrators. In particular I found when I got to Via's chapters, and her description of the ambiguity of her feelings, how she sometimes felt overlooked, and the relief of going away to be with her grandma, I had a hard time keeping reading, and was choking back the tears. I never understood about why I had this particularly close relationship with my grandma, or that some of these ambiguous feelings could be common to siblings of children who are different. Like Via I love my brother, and was always fiercely defensive of him, and like her I struggled with my human weaknesses around him.

0307744434|5.0|I'm not even done reading this book yet but I'm going to review it anyway...it's that good.  No, great!  I thought it would be like most of the current Young Adult books that are making such a big splash recently - but it's not!  It's written for adults.  I also thought I'd not really enjoy the \\"fantasy\\" aspect - but again, I was wrong.  It's so beautifully written that I've actually  been drawn in to the very practical version of fantasy contained in this book.  It's not outlandishly inconceivable as some fantasy books are (to me, anyway).  I have not been able to put it down since I picked it up only 2 days ago (I'm nearly done already).  I'm not a great writer so I'm not going to attempt to outline and summarize the book, as some do.  I'll just state that if you want a book that you will stay up late reading and even bring to work with you to read on your lunch break because you can't be away from it - this is the book for you.
0307477479|5.0|I've always enjoyed novels-in-stories. For my money, [[ASIN:0375507256 David]] [[ASIN:0375724508 Mitchell's]] [[ASIN:349804513X books]] are the best examples of how novels-in-stories can be used to great effect. Others from [[ASIN:1400032822 Palahniuk]] to [[ASIN:0312425023 Cunningham]] have attempted them with some differing measures of success. Still though, the idea of showing how separate stories can intertwine and coalesce into a greater whole is a fascinating and ever-more-popular element of culture (even the once-lauded [[ASIN:B0042YZGB8 Lost]] is an example of this).<br /><br />Egan's own contribution to this idea may not have deserved the Pulitzer, but it's still one of the best books I've read in recent years. The stories follow a group of people from the sixties up into a distant future where words like \\"identity,\\" \\"real,\\" and \\"change\\" are no longer definable outside of their ironic meanings. The characters have experiences from the deserts of America to the wilds of Africa, and although they sometimes endure radically different situations, they all struggle with the same need to find themselves and to fight the inexorable plod of time.<br /><br />It can get confusing at times. The stories are not arranged in any kind of chronological order, and since they involve many different lives, the cast list can be cumbersome to some readers. The only solid element of the book that ties them all together is a connection with music, but this is tangential to the characters themselves. Even when the events take place in a tech-heavy future, Egan avoids prolonged exposition about time and place, letting the effects and impacts of the places resonate within the characters themselves. They are all rich, evocative, and fully realized by Egan's pitch-perfect and finely tuned prose.<br /><br />If you wanted only to read this book as a collection of stories, it would still be just as fruitful. If you want to do the homework of tracing lines of connection, the domino effect of actions rippling forward through lives, it adds an extra vein of meaning and satisfaction to the book's scope. Enjoyable on multiple levels, Egan's novel is the kind of immediately accessible experiment that is easy to warm up to, and which leaves behind that telltale ache of regret (sort of like with life itself) when it seems to finish before its time.of actions rippling forward through lives, it adds an extra vein of meaning and satisfaction to the book's scope.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The book starts off with a very appealing and witty voice, but the wit doesn't carry through to the end because the story gets dark and the protagonist gets more serious. Thus, unfortunately, part of the initial appeal of the book fades as the voice darkens. In its place emerges a fantasy universe with evil forces fighting a band of oddly assorted good guys - the norm for this type of fiction. But the universe seems oddly contrived. Perhaps this is because the story was woven around a group of authentic antique photographs - all the images in the book are actual found photos, not created to fit the narrative but vice verse - the narrative was created to fit the photos, as I understand it. It's wildly clever, given this background fact. I admire the work... I just didn't ever fall in love with it.<br /><br />The story is pretty good, a fun read for fans of literary fantasy... but it ain't no Harry Potter or Hunger Games. I would recommend it for big fans of the genre, but not for general readers looking for a great book. I don't feel compelled to read the sequels at all.
B006O7XOOW|4.0|My one-year-old granddaughter loves this toy.  She runs around giggling and shoving the balls back in the ballcano.  She figured out how it works quickly.  It seems sturdy for a child her size.  The balls aren't the flimsy ones like you get with a ball pit.  In fact, they are quite sturdy.  The music, lights, and bright colors make for exciting playtime.  The toy teaches eye-hand coordination and problem-solving skills.  The toy does need 4AA batteries that are not included.  The only downside really was I had to put it together with some tiny screws, and it only came with six balls.  For the price, I would expect more balls.

So with that I am glad I waited to see this on DVD instead of going to the theatre to spend $4 dollars at the matinee, it didn't really make that much sense to me at all. I even heard one other critical reviewer on a radio show say \\"Who wants to go see a movie about a bunch of teenagers killing other teenagers\\", for the sake of surviving members of the human race in order to win at a game show? The plot and storyline was all sappy at the end of it and they're gonna make a sequel out of this crap and waste millions of more dollars in doing so.

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is a very fun app! You will love it! I do wish it had n integrated writing journal ----- but I still give it 5 stars! There are crayons, markers, and more that can be used to put writing into the pictures!
B0041T52S6|5.0|Scott Pilgrim a 22 year old slacker that is dating a high schooler and lives in some wierd video game kinda world. Killing People gets you coins, every one has rating systems & Dream sequances are like cut scenes.<br />  When Scott literaly meets the Girl of His dreams he  is sent on a quest to defeat Ramona's 7 evil ex's In one completly original movie experiance.<br /><br />  Edgar Wright knows comedy and he clearly also know's Video Games and Comics.<br /><br />This is one kick ass movie.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|I have purchased all of the Big Bang Seasons.  It is like having Leonard, Sheldon and everyone right in the room with you when watching it. The picture is as clear as my TV and the sound is great.  This product is well worth the money spent.
B0000640SA|5.0|We all know the name of Christopher Nolan thanks to his superb Dark Knight Trilogy & Inception. What you may not know is he has other great films one  being Memento.<br /><br />  Memento is literaly the most confusing movie you will ever  watch. Just Like Leanord (Guy Prearce) you'll feal like you can't  remeber. The editing, the shots, the acting the Noir style all add up to one great film with a great ending.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I use this alot while shopping at other stores - I will check to see if Amazon has it for about the same or less (usually its less) and then I just order it and wait the two days (I have prime)for it to arrive. Sometimes I will see an item but it makes me think of something else I need that the store I'm in does not carry - so I check Amazon. I even impressed my boss while she was doing a supply order for our office and I told her she could get the item cheaper through Amazon (ink) and then pulled out my phone and showed her. Got a bonus for it!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is so fun! I like it cuz it gives me something to do when I'm bored and challenging words to choose from!! I LOVE it!!! :D
B005DZMP1E|5.0|Records are amazing. If you have the CD, you should still get the record. Obviously, it's a great album. Reckless and Relentless is equally good, and I think this seller has that one to. So, buy it, love it, blast it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|this was a very good book. this book was a bit slow to get started but was well worth reading it was a good way to end the trilogy
B00846REIS|2.0|After reading the hype that this was a great follow-up to Fifty Shades of Grey, I wanted to see for myself.  I almost stopped reading it a few times because I was so bored.  The characters had good chemistry but that was it.  There was no emotional chemistry, too much past emotional damage, and I got tired reading about all of the perfect-looking characters.  There were some overlaps with Fifty Shades like the attractive CEO, stalking and jealousy, but it  didn't feel original.  This is one I wish I hadn't picked up.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put this book down it was very good. loved this trilogy. the story line on this series is wonderful
B002ZG99TA|5.0|A great movie to see about a runaway train and all the events surrounding it. The background, the development and the character-building are great. \\"Unstoppable\\" makes one hold one's breath from the beginning until the end. I can highly recommended it.
0345803507|5.0|I was so hooked on this last book that i couldn't drop the book down. I wish there was another book to continue it, i was left wanting more. Overall all three of them are good to read.
B006TL9O3S|5.0|This is a classic of crime fiction, sly and deceptively simple, with all the features of staid English life, including the seamy underbelly. The e-edition works perfectly.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this a fun game it does glitch out sometimes but its still fun but some of the items are too expensive
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|How could this two disc DVD edition be any better you ask? I wish it had a commentary from director Christopher Nolan. I have never seen a performance as great as Heath Ledger's \\"Joker\\" portrayal. I loved all the extras and I immediately downloaded the digital copy so I could watch it on anything I have! Just a great movie.
0385742886|2.0|Run, fight infected zombies, repeat, repeat and repeat again.  While we do get some of the back story, most of the book is recurrent \\"barely made it\\" escapes that seem mainly there to give the book enough length to justify buying it.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This is an awesome DVD and a \\"must have\\" for any Batman fan! The only thing that could have made this DVD any better is a commentary from director Christopher Nolan. The Special Features disc is loaded with cool features that really enhance your movie viewing experience.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This is a timeless classic -far less traumatizing than its abridged film version- telling a tale of endless adventure as Dorothy and her motley crew of misfit companions each searching for something missing in their lives.<br /><br />Filled with life lessons fit for young and young at heart.<br /><br />I've rated it 4+ on the following scale.<br />+ poor read<br />++ so-so read<br />+++ good read<br />++++ excellent read<br />+++++ life changing read<br /><br />I would rate the kindle format 5+ with no observed formating issues, or typos, and for the inclusion of a fully indexed table of contents.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|this game is awesome! I love it! so fun:) me and my sister play this game all of the time
0345803507|1.0|I am a very avid reader and I admit, I was intrigued by all the buzz surrounding these books.  There was a LOT of it.  Thank GOD I didn't pay a penny for any of these.  All three of these books are just terrible in every way that many of the reviewers have already stated.  VERY poorly written, repetitive, boring, not sensual at all.  I never once felt even a slight tingle of sensation at any of the 'sex' scenes that I read.  More, I found them offensive and/or disturbing.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:  I also found the way she ended the whole trilogy to be quite disgusting.  Ana, the main character is quite pregnant and Christian, her dominant/gorgeous/mercurial/rich/talented/stunning/etc. husband has her shackled in their 'play room' and is smacking her with his flog.  I know, they've done this many time before but to describe her pregnancy and her protruding belly in the process was tasteless and made my stomach turn.<br /><br />James ends the book by starting over at the beginning only writing from Christian's perspective.  Truly amateurish attempt to eek more pages out.  She then writes that \\"that is all, for now...\\"  We can only hope and pray that that is all... forever.<br /><br />It was nice that she thanked, thanked, thanked the readers for reading her books.  She also needs to thank, thank, thank the marketing geniuses that snowed the female population into buying these books.  I have yet to actually meet a real person who would have given these books more than one or two stars and have to believe that most of the reviews written here are plants.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|Have played this great game countless times on my ipod with no problems at all. But this game runs horrible on the Kindle Fire. Studdering and screen tearing hurt an otherwise great game.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Although this book has it's hardships, I feel it's a good story for people to read. A refreshing concept, the author chose to tell the story from the horse's point of view. This added a new dimension to a good story line. I think horse lovers and history buffs will both enjoy this book. The horse's view puts a different spin on the hardships of war without including every brutal detail. It is an easy read, allowing the reader to get through the story quickly; however, it's hard to put down once you start. I haven't seen the movie yet, as I was determined to get through the book first. Going into the book, I thought it would be longer with a little more character development, but there's still enough for you to get attached to the characters. Overall, a very good book :)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Courage and selflessness. With a side of humor. Great book. Great hero. Reading his story will make you appreciate what the armed forces do for us Americans. Thank you all
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Having grown up with the original Oregon Trail, I was excited to find this app thinking it would be somewhat similar to the original. It's not. It could still have a good story line, but I personally grew bored with it and after a certain point where I couldn't do anything (maybe it locked up?) I just deleted it. Hope it works better for you!

B0086700CM|4.0|A fun game to play. It's a little more difficult on a bigger device since you have to use one hand to tilt and the other to jump and maneuver. Still, I enjoy playing on my kindle and it's a great, easy (concept wise) game to take your mind off things for a while.
0765356139|5.0|There are many challenges to face after you overthrow a man who has ruled for a thousand years, as Vin and Elend are finding out after their unlikely victory against the Lord Ruler. It is also very idealistic of Elend Venture to think that the people, who have been oppressed for so long, have any interest in participating in a parliamentary government. Many think that to restore the balance of power, the only real option is to crown another ultimate, single ruler. Three men who follow that line of thinking have come to be heard, and each brought his army. Vin believes that she can save the way of life they have fought so hard to win if she can find the source of the Lord Ruler's power, the Well of Ascension.<br /><br />I was concerned that after such a complex first book that there just wouldn't be enough left in the author's tank. I was wrong. Boy was I wrong. There is a lot going on in this book and I had to stop periodically through the book to wonder if it would all come together. Honestly, I cannot remember the last time I was this impressed by a book. Brandon Sanderson wrote a book where everything had a place; everything belonged and nothing was left to chance. Sanderson masterfully crafted a sequel that was even better than its predecessor.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A great, free option to have Angry Birds on your Kindle. This game is highly addicting, but oh-so-much fun. I would recommend it!
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I've wanted them for months and was a little bit scared of what size to get. I tried on my true size and it was perfect even though I have very wide feet. They're so comfortable and they do stretch out over time to fit your feet better. Definitely recommend this.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|If you love Pictionary, you'll enjoy this game. Playing with friends or people you don't know adds differing ideas to the mix. Only downside is the people who just write the word to get the points. I didn't download the game to be told the answer - that's no fun. But that downside cannot be a reflection of the app (but rather the laziness and lack of imagination of some players). I've had this game for a while and intend to continue playing. Lots of fun :)
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Hmmm!  I've set out to put down my thoughts about this book a few different times and keep hesitating which is not like me when I finish a book.  I asked to receive this book because I read so many wonderful reviews and because of the blurb on it.  I've been hearing about the fairly new genre of New Adult and thought this would be a nice read to introduce me to it.<br /><br />The story takes place on a small college (and for those who are wondering who've read the story already- yes, there are small colleges that can make one feel like they are living in a fish bowl where everyone knows your business because I attended one) when a bad boy falls for an apparently nice innocent girl.  Her rebuffs intrigue and delight him rather than put him off so he lays out a bet that she loses in which she must (when I say 'must' I gotta say that I mean she is choosing to stay though she tries to convince everyone otherwise) stay with him for a month in which they both form a friendship that defies the understanding of all.  Both parties, Travis and Abby, want more, but there are many complications that will and do pull them apart when they do give it a chance for more.  Their relationship is what gives the book its title.<br /><br />Now for my opinion- which is exactly what this is, MY opinion.  I state that because there are so many others with vastly different opinions (like always- hehe).  I had a love-hate thing going with this story.  In fact, it took me much longer than usual to finish reading it because of how it pulled me back and forth between 'can't put it down to see what happens' next to the very dangerous (and expensive because I read it on my kindle) temptation to throw it against a wall in frustration.<br /><br />What aroused such feelings?  This is the part that will contain spoilers just so I can explain my impressions of the story.  So read on at your own risk!!!!<br /><br />First of all, I love a good opposites attract/ wrong, but right for each other story.  I also loved the camaraderie with all the friends in the story.  I adored Travis' family. And some of the plot conflict was riveting.  But- and its a big 'but' because the story is entirely from this character's point of view and she's a main character- I hated Abby a great deal of the time.  Small third world dictators could take lessons for torture of the emotional kind from her.  And she was so good at it that she was able to take down several people (some multiple times) in this story.  While she was busy- first being in denial that Travis loved her and she, him(in the face of everyone telling her the same thing)- and then being in full self-protection mode with the hot/cold treatment to Travis (don't want to get hurt/I'm scared- want guy- but don't want to get hurt again/I'm scared of my own feelings loop) and then finally in her spiteful pride phase (you screwed up though at the time you owed me nothing and I'm going to hold it against you no matter how broken and miserable I can see you are), she ripped out a guy's heart more than once, broke up her best friend's romance because said BFF loyally sided with her against her own boyfriend who was the cousin to Travis (broken hearted guy mentioned earlier), and toyed (not on purpose-much of the time- to be fair) with perfectly nice guys giving the impression that she was available then pulled back from them.  I really struggled to buy her hang-ups particularly with all the 'I'm the one who's bad for him and I'll ruin him' even after I was given the explanation about her past dealings that led to these thoughts. I don't normally include book comparisons, but just to help explain the Abby character here.  She reminded me strongly of the Bella Swan character in New Moon and Eclipse with her dealings with Jacob (I need you, but we can never be more than friends behavior).<br /><br />Now, before I appear entirely unfair and fixated about Abby, let me just say that I don't think its wrong for Abby to take a 'lets be friends' approach when she first gets started out with Travis or a little later making it a 'lets take our time'  when they enter a relationship because he is into some serious stuff- bare knuckle fighting for cash, sleeping around with a reputation (that is earned) for one night stands and having emotional issues of neediness, anger and jealousy.  But, you see, her 'lets be friends' was her lying to herself and everyone else as evidenced by her thoughts and actions.  And his emotional issues many times are a direct result of her behavior.  Travis was truly a bad boy (personally, I'm not enamored with this in real life- showing my age here) and I would not have faulted her caution if it was an honest caution that was not laced with hypocrisy.<br /><br />As to the other aspects of the story, (I am about to confuse you when I say that I loved it) I loved when things were going good and Travis and Abby were together and he was trying so hard to change.  The deft touch of friends and lovers really struck a nice chord with me.  I really enjoyed the dynamics of the double dating couples between the two cousin sets of Travis and Abby and Shep and America.  Shep, America and Finch were great secondary characters.  The other scenes that were touching was the two spent with Travis' dad and brothers.  I'm a huge lover of meeting the family in the story.  Finally, getting into what hurt was in Abby's past just made me feel for her.  The excitement of Travis' fights, the trip to Vegas the first time and the fire were page turning moments.<br /><br />I can certainly see why this is touted as a wonderful read because it does draw an emotional response.  When a book engages me with any emotion then I think the author did a pretty good job even if the book's not for me.<br /><br />So, my foray into Beautiful Disaster left me a little emotionally drained, but I can and do recommend this book to those who enjoy a good angsty read that leaves them wrung out, but satisfied in the end.  I will caution this as a recommend for an impressionable teen because there is much about the relationship that is not commendable on both Travis and Abby's parts.<br /><br />Thank you to Net Galley for providing the ARC copy for review purposes.nds' approach when she first gets started out with Travis or a little later making it a 'lets take our time'  when they enter a relationship because he is into some serious stuff- bare knuckle fighting for cash, sleeping around with a reputation (that is earned) for one night stands and having emotional issues of neediness, anger and jealousy.

030758836X|2.0|I heard so many great things about this book, so I started reading it.  The first 100 pages or so were boring and never pulled me in.  can not say I cared one way or another about either of the main characters.  The back and forth style of writing also made the story line a bit difficult to follow in the beginning (nothing major, but when you have read 100 pages and still not hooked it does not take much to distract you!). Once I got through the first section, the story line became much more captivating and I was hooked.  I thought, finally, this is what all the hype was about.  I could not wait to see how it ended, but as it turns out, I could have.  The ending was dreadfuI.  I felt like the author had written such an elaborate plot to this book and did not know how to tie up all the loose ends, so the books just ends.  And the outcome is not one I can imagine many people would care for, nor is it believable.  If you want to kill some time, read the book, enjoy the middle (which again is brillant), but consider this a warning for the let down you will get with the ending.  -note this review is written from a female in her early thirties-
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Absolutely fell into this book! I started out reading this book due to all of the talk surrounding it and completely lost myself in it.
B008CP93S0|1.0|Unless you like foul language, a bad plot, and other unpleasant things, you might want to avoid this movie.  I love Alan Alda, but this was a bomb.  I had mute most of the movie because it was disgusting.  Stopped it finally when I couldn't take any more.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I was sad to find out House was going off the air;however,I wasn't surprised. Personally,I would have liked to have seen at least one more season,but that's just me. :P<br /><br />The addition of Dr. Adams(Odette Annable) and Park(Charlyne Yi) as the two new doctors were welcome. I'm gonna come right out and say it:I was OK with Lisa Edelstein leaving the show.A small but vocal  group of fans has made their feelings known about how Edelstein was written out of the show- and about  Annable and Yi.This is Season 8, not Season  7.<br /><br />There were big changes(the season starts with House  in prison,which is where he meets Dr. Adams. You were never quite sure where they were going to go with plot lines, but..they worked(if anyone was *start spoiler alert* going to get cancer..I thought it would be House. Kinda out of left  field for  Dr. Wilson(Robert Sean Leonard) to be  the one who does *end spoiler*<br /><br />Other plot lines like  Chase's stabbing in Nobody's Fault are not dropped  suddenly-he didn't have an instant recovery like  how it is in some medical dramas where a doctor gets injured and they're fine the next week(I'm looking at YOU, Chicago Hope).<br /><br />House  has always been able  to get good guest  stars(especially memorable this season? Battlestar Galactica's Jamie Bamber and  Medium's Jake Weber, as well as Billy Connolly as House's stepfather.<br /><br />Admittedly I was nervous about how they would end House. I hoped they wouldn't go for the lame, \\"blowing up the hospital\\" ending. They didn't.That's  how Grey's Anatomy will end, with all likelihood. No,House got it SO right. I mean, if I had been writing the final episode, that is exactly the  ending I would have written.It was perfect.It allowed the audience  to make  up their  own mind about what happened to the characters(though House and Wilson's fates were  far more ambiguous than the rest.)
B001AQR3MQ|3.0|This movie is not as good as I thought it would be.  Very good stars in a mediocre script.  I was intrigued by the concept of suicide not being permanent but redeemable. Turned out to be not so much about that but about William's anger over the situation.  The ending was kind of tacked on as well.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|looking forward to the next 2 books.  Fun to read, sexy, hot, my boyfriends tells me to take a break and read for awhile... too funny.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Really interested perspective of online marketing. It was an easy read and I would recommend this book to anyone that is trying to market a business online (not just authors).
B000NY12LO|5.0|I have been trying to like Jodi Picoult for years! This book is actually the first of hers that I have finished....and finished in a day and a half!!!! I have tried reading at least half a dozen of her books but I either loose interest or I just cannot follow along because the scenes are always jumping from one period or one character to another. I also don't like reading books that are written in the first person. This book fits just right and was able to grab my attention. Maybe it is partly because I have a child in school who is similar with Peter. A sensitive and not your stereotype of a boy. I don't know what I will do if my own child face the kind of bullying that Peter endured. Jodi Picoult gave me a wider insight on the efffects of bullying. While this is fiction, it could very well happen and I am sure it is happening in many schools. I highly recommend this book. Maybe I will try reading some more of her books.

B001974DG0|5.0|Dean Koontz is one of the best writers in this genre. \\"Watchers\\" was the first Koontz book I had read. \\"Lightning\\", \\"Strangers\\", Life Expectancy\\" and the \\"Frankenstein\\" saga are his top books, in my opinion. While I still love Stephen King, Dean Koontz novels are less gory and more cerebral. He gets you to really care about the characters, to the point that you (or at least I) actually worried about the tough jams they are thrown into! The twists and turns he writes are unexpected and highly entertaining. I just never know what to expect. I must also mention the \\"Odd Thomas\\" series, too. I finally purchased all of them and starting with the first one, I went through them like a knife through butter. I believe any fan of Stephen King, Jonas Saul, etc, will be happy with Dean Koontz's books. I've bought the e-books even though I have most of them in hardcover. Lastly I have to say that one of the reasons I love his writing so much is that there seems to be a strong female central to every story. I appreciate that fact. I always feel better about myself and my abilities after reading one of his books.
B004XUMN6W|5.0|I respect everyone's opinion, but I thought this was an outstanding episode. If I could give it 10 Stars, I would... Different strokes for different folks.... Lol
B008BM9L72|1.0|Top marks to the author for selling so many copies of this badly written rubbish. Dubious plot aside, the limited vocabulary was extremely irritating and considering the heroine purported to be studying English literature she seemed to have gleaned remarkably little benefit from her efforts. I imagined that a teenager was behind this infantile offering, but apparently not. How tragic that literary standards have dropped so low that this pathetic drivel has achieved such notoriety. I'm revisiting the Clasics as an antidote- can't imagine that this appalling trilogy will be making it into this illustrious category, but Heaven help us if it does.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Hands down the most poorly written book i have ever read. Writer tries too hard to use a vocabulary that they are obviously not comfortable with. Every other page the characters are \\"murmuring, biting lips,\\" and having the most unnatural dialogue ever! This story is an abolescent rip off of Nine and a Half Weeks, with unbelievable characters, and if erotica is your preference, I'd recommend that, not fifty shades.
B0083EM24C|5.0|If you liked their last album, definitely check this out.  A very familiar sound from them, but with enough variance to keep you interested.

B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Had heard about this game for years and found it frustrating. And more than once it wouldn't load and/or would cut out in the midst of a game. Uninspired.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|They have got to be kidding.  This is the worst book I have ever read.  Poorly written, one dimensional characters and so boring, are just the worst flaws.  I thought that if Ana knew- in spectacular detail no less -every minute thought in Grey's head from the look in his eyes one more time, I would scream.  I hope that young people dont read this and beleive that everyone has heart stoppingly great sex every single time.  Just plain awful.
B006LQQ1GE|2.0|Like pretty much everyone else around the world who's either bought or borrowed this album, I fell a little bit in love with \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" when I heard it on the radio.  In a music world oversaturated with auto tune, electronic dance music, and just generally poor musicianship, Gotye's fresh take on pop music was a breath of fresh air.  \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" is undeniably unique, and if the rest of this album is even half as good as that one particular song, it MUST be hit, right?<br /><br />Wrong.  Billy Corgan recently made a statement about the music industry:  \\"If you're just going to create an album of singles, then I guess you don't care.  ...The public's interest in albums has diminished, it sort of rewards those people who can come up with the one song.  You have, in essence, the wrong end of the telescope.  It's like guilt by implication.  So if you come up with this one song, people think, Oh, this artist is so great!\\"  He must have been listening to this record before he made that statement, because it describes this album PERFECTLY.  As a single, \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" is gold.  It's unique, it's quirky, it utilizes instruments not heard by 99.9% of other popular artists, and it seems to tell a story.  However, it doesn't really fit into the framework of the album, 'Making Mirrors'.  More to the point, none of the songs on this album fit into anything even remotely resembling a framework.  'Making Mirrors' is little more than a collection of 12 singles packaged as an album.<br /><br />Now, if you're into that, fine, but I have a major problem with 'Making Mirrors' becoming a hit album based on the popularity of one song.  Gotye dabbles in a lot of different sounds and musical genres in these 12 songs, but they don't really fit in with or play off of each other.  They just...are.  I also have a major problem with Gotye touring major arenas all across the country based on the success of \\"Somebody That I Used to Know,\\" but that's another argument altogether.<br /><br />I guess you could say I agree with Billy Corgan, and I feel like this album is just...lazy.  What ever happened to bands/artists recording and amassing a huge collection of songs then piecing those songs together into a cohesive record?  I'm not saying it has to be a long narrative like Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' or a concept album like The Sword's 'Warp Riders', but to haphazardly slap together a bunch of songs and call it an album spits in the face of music lovers everywhere.that's another argument altogether.<br /><br />I guess you could say I agree with Billy Corgan, and I feel like this album is just...lazy.

I'm not saying it has to be a long narrative like Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' or a concept album like The Sword's 'Warp Riders', but to haphazardly slap together a bunch of songs and call it an album spits in the face of music lovers everywhere.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. sometimes I don't have enough time in the morning to catch the forecast so I grab my kindle fire and boom - there we go. very easy to use, and very organized. love it! :)
B0086DB566|1.0|While the cast is impressive, this re-make of this classic fairy tale is - well - offensively lame to the extreme. I was truly happiest in the noted characters (more about that later) with Julia Robert's part in the telling of the Evil Queen - but that was about it. Nathan Lane? You must have been paid well. Prince Charming - Arnie Hammmer's best scene was when under a spell from said evil queen, behaving as a dog...a puppy, to be exact. Let's face it, it isn't as though he needs the money, is it? Lily whoever the heck she is as Snow White really needed her eyebrows plucked - I mean REALLY - and even hairier, her character took nearly identical ideas and scenes from Once Upon a Time on ABC. The Seven Dwarfs were by far the best actors and entertainers of all however, keeping closest to the original tale characters, and kept me watching the darn movie...yet these incredible actors received so very little accolades it was sad and downright wrong. Grimm's Fairy Tales are all melded with horror, intended to be so, and this? Well, I'm sorry I bought it. Actually bought this nonsense, yes, I admit it. According to Bollywood-style, there was, of course, a dancing/singing piece at the end after Snow White did NOT eat the poison apple! Who thought of THAT anyway? I literally forced my endurance of a piece of the ending which was, of course, the singing dancing happy happy joy joy Bollywood junk. Arnie? You have two or three left feet, but you're nice to look at in the scenes that took advantage of your chest hair. The storyline is not at all like the original, though it could have been enjoyable, had it had any merit of course - which it doesn't. Sadly looking at my wallet having been plucked by this awful film, I look forward to Snow White and the Huntsman to purchase - hmmm, perhaps rent, as well as continuing to watch Once Upon a Time and Grimm - both (almost) free on HULU. My opinion? Don't waste your money, and if you like Bollywood films well...to each his/her own. Be well, all.well, all.
B00138F080|5.0|MGMT.wow.Not sure why they aren't more successful.  I got the follow up Congratulations from my local library just because of the coverart. It ended up being my favorite album of 2010. Oracular Spectacular I got because I couldn't wait any longer for the new album.  I only knew the song Kids. This is better than Congratulations. Weekend Wars, Electric Feel, The Youth, & Time to Pretend all could be hits in the right setting. (before radio stations only played one specific genre & ruined quality cross pollination of sounds)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was amazing! I loved reading every second of it. It ended so sweetly! I would recommend this book to other people.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Ok--i'm not going to review the movie as there are hundreds of reviews on the movie.  This is a review of the product--or more specifically the digital product that comes with the physical product.<br /><br />I wanted to let everyone know that the digital copy is itunes or ultra-violet.  if you do Itunes you get the standard definition version, the high def version, and the itunes extras.<br /><br />On top of that, amazon gives you a copy in your amazon library. You get instant viewing and unlike movies in the past, this one is not a rental---you get to keep a standard definition AND a high-def version in your amazon digital library forever.<br /><br />So I am the happiest person in the world right now and can access the hunger games from clouds, ipods, computers, and a boring old blu ray player!!
B008BIN9EW|3.0|Ya it's free but big deal. Great Big War Game is way better for turn based strategy and it also has online multiplayer.
B006PKQQJS|4.0|I love this game a lot my only complaint is I wish they had more leavles. It is also very addicting. may look stupid but is very fun! :D
0071766588|4.0|In general, I think the ETS Guide is the best book to use for TOEFL preparation.  In fact, I lobbied my college department for years in order to get them to switch to this book for our TOEFL prep program.  They finally did, just in time for the 4th edition, and now I am totally pissed off about the CD change that came without warning!  In the past editions, teachers could use the CD with their classes, because the CD allowed you to either install the test program or to just listen to the audio tracks.  Since teachers are not allowed to install programs onto classroom computers, we now cannot use the part of the CD that requires installation.  The 4th edition CD does not allow you to listen to the audio tracks without installing the software.  So now all the students have books and the teachers have books, and we cannot play any of the audio tracks in class!  There was no indication of that change at all before we got the book.  I can't understand why ETS would make that change, surely knowing that many schools order the book for classes and that teachers would not be able easily access the audio tracks in class.  Therefore, I give the book 4 stars instead of the 5 it would have otherwise.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. I have a hard time keeping up with notes in class so I take my notes on this. its so fun too! I can make my own study guides to study and put reminders down. its my little planner/notebook! thank you so much EVERNOTE!
B001DU8T6S|1.0|When I first heard this CD I wasn't sure if it was some kind of joke. It sounded like a caricature of all the worst elements of a cliche rock band. Juvenile, pointless, songs. Hannah Montana writes more sophisticated music than this. This isn't Queen and this isn't even Paul Rogers. I'm not sure what this is. Being a dedicated Queen fan I gave it 5 listens then tried to pass it off at a garage sale for a buck. It didn't sell. This along with the Who's Endless Wire (another horrible disappointment) are the only two CDs I banished from my collection and simply threw in the trash.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This app is the best ever because...<br /><br />  1. The graphics are great<br />  2. All of the times you play it is different<br />  3. The store rodent make you pay to get stuff
B008MEM24S|4.0|Its fun and offers a different challange from where's my water. My kids absolity loves it. Well worth the buck you pay.
B008DB3N5W|1.0|Manowar shows themselves to be old, slow and boring and out of ideas. Eric's voice sounds awful. If this band played for Early-80's-Manowar *they'd* think this band was terrible for sure! The songs are all too long because they don't go anywhere or do anything. The album lacks energy and will bore you to tears if you can sit through all the buzzing long enough to make it to the end. At best it is uninspired. At worst it's just a collection of bad boring songs. Don't even get me started on the buzzword lyrics that don't mean anything at all.<br /><br />There are so many bands that are good now to spend your money on. Don't buy this. It will only encourage the band to put out more crap.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|I am a big HOG fan and decided to try this one after reading the reviews.  I was very disappointed. There is no zoom and that is a problem,  but I am stuck on the station clock puzzle.  HOGs usually give a skip option on puzzles as well, so getting stuck won't kill your game. Now I am stuck with a game I can't even play past a certain point.
B00005JGAB|5.0|Read all the other reviews, they've done the hard work for me. I'm just giving this the 5 stars it deserves to boost the ratings & yh it rocks & it's a classic! Best punk album of all-time!
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I loved this game on my ipod. Hex strategy at its finest. I cant wait to play it on a larger KFire screen. A well deserved 5 stars!
1878424319|5.0|What an amazing book. Its was so amazing that I had to write a review and I have never ever had such an inclination to do so before.<br /><br />It made me realise how beautiful we all are as humans but we are so caught up in the everyday world of stress and deadlines. That we forget to be Thankful for being Alive!<br /><br />How do we unstress by gossiping with our friends because we want/need everyone else's lives to be as miseralbe as ours.<br /><br />WOW! I am still on this mental high, Please read this book as I plan on giving this book to all my friends and family.It gives you insight and clarity on the world and yourself, I am serious when I say that you really have to Stop and Smell the Flowers.<br />WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!!!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I have no problems with this product. If you are a true Gilmore Girls fan, this is the product for you! Also, the case that comes with it is a great organizer for the  DVDs.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Works excellent. I've made various documents on it and have no complaints whatsoever. Totally worth the buy. I bought it for 99 cents too so hell, I'm a happy sponge.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|We always love Dexter. This season had it's ups and downs but we still love Dexter's \\"code\\" and enjoyed this season. Since I do't have cable, it is amazing to be able to purchase it on Amazon at such a great price right away, otherwise we have to wait forever to get it in the mail.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is awesome! Its very entertaining and they present you with a new quest everyday. Its like playing a brand new game every home you open this app.
B00005JMCN|4.0|I loved this movie.  Very heartwarming and I have recommended it to several people.  This movie shows how anyone can overcome such adversity and become such an inspiration to the world.
B002SRQ214|4.0|As far as the processor goes its a 5 star! It performs great and runs at a smooth 3.4Ghz out of the box. No cons at all for that. The only reason I gave 4 stars is due to the loudness of the cpu fan that I was not expecting. It starts to quiet down after a few boots but when running games at all high setting it could get annoying for some. No worry though, a new cpu cooler from coolermaster or thermaltake are not too expensive!
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I was always hoping that somebody would port starcraft to a more modern operating system and while that has not happened...  this is the next best thing. Fantastic game. Highly recommended!
B005LAIH9K|5.0|it was good and on time, i really enjoy the movie and the condition that it was in =). I look forward to my next purchase.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I don't know how someone could rate this as one-star game, that's just silly. Many games come and go on my Kindle Fire, but this one is a constant, along with a handful of other gems. If you ever played Avalon Hill or other hex games, or Warhammer or Starcraft, you should love this gem. One star? Get real. This game is a great diversion,  get it while it's free!
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|This movie does not take it's self seriously.  It is made for pure enjoyment and for the 3-D effects.  If you have a sense of humor and want to see a good 3-D movie, see it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The ending of the book is so disappointing and horrible that it made me angry that I had wasted time reading it. The beginning was slow and the middle showed promise but overall I don't understand what the buzz is about. Terrible book
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like playing while waiting in lines.  This is an easy app to play.  There are a lot of ads but only in between games.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|It is a really fun game but it would be five star if you could maybe go back to a home screen and choose the level u want to play. even go bqck to your earlier levels. its annoying that i have to mqke a new slot if i wanna replay earlier levels. But i STILL LOVE IT!
B000RLR0WS|4.0|I was a little disappointed the item was lost in the mail but as soon as I contacted the company they sent a replacement & I received it in less then 48hrs
B008GFI4KY|5.0|Two words describe this release, absolutely amazing. Very rarely do I buy entire albums worth of material ever. This is one of the ones I'm glad I did. All the elements of old are there, the crazy falsetto singing, the great guitar work and the amazing harmonies. It certainly reminds me of the days of old when great rock music ruled the world. I was reminded listening to these tracks of Queen, Priest, ELO and a gaggle of other bands from the 70's and 80's. Even the ballads that were derided by other reviewers were not too sweet but just right. As always the choruses in the songs are filled with hooks 8 miles wide and 10 miles deep. As a musician and song writer myself, I thoroughly enjoy hearing their evolution as writers and the kick ass music they are making.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a great read! I couldn't put the book down! I really enjoyed it and I think you will too! Definitely get all 3 books! There worth it!
0007477155|5.0|Claiming that this is a \\"Complete Box Set\\" of \\"All 7 Books\\" is not quite accurate.  If you are unfamiliar with how the Song of Ice and Fire series has been released around the world, take note that this is the non-US version of the books.  For a variety of marketing reasons, some of the longer books have been split into more than one book in countries outside the United States.<br /><br />If you are someone purchasing this series for the first time, or if you are purchasing this as a gift, you should be aware that this isn't the US edition.  The content is the same, however.<br /><br />The important thing, therefore, is that however you cut it, GRRM crafts a compelling story in a extremely detailed world, which can be read over and over again.  If you're a fan of the HBO series, I would highly recommend reading the books, since many aspects of the story are deemphasized or otherwise ignored.  There is only so much you can fit into 12 episodes seasons.<br /><br />But, if you are a US reader, you may want the US versions of the books, as a point of reference when discussing details with others who are reading the books.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Here's The Lowedown on \\"The Hunger Games\\" (A Sci-Fi/Fantasy DVD review)...LOVED IT!!    Become a fan of The Lowedown on Facebook:  [...]    Genre: 9 Movie: 8    What's it about?  Set in a future where the Capitol selects a boy and girl from the twelve districts to fight to the death on live television, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her younger sister's place for the latest match.    What did I think?  The young adult book series of The Hunger Games steps into the movie realm as many others (Harry Potter, Twilight, etc.) have done.  This ranks right up there with those and I look forward to them finishing the series.  If you read the books, you will like the movie...and if you haven't, you will still like it.  It is easy to follow with good action and a strong cast.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|I can not say enough good things about this release. Most concerts don't have a high replay value for me, but this one does. This concert is great for people who like Christmas music performed in a traditional manner, no contemporary re-workings of the songs here. Andrea's voice, a always, is stunning as are the voices of the guests. The DTS surround mix is worth the price alone, you will need a surround decoder to hear it, but it definitely is worth it!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I likes Lep's World even though it was like a Mario brother spoof. I thought it was preety cool. I gave it four stars.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|nice big buttons and its easy to use. if you just need the basics in a calculator, you picked the right one.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I only have about 30 games on my Fire so it's pretty good to say that this is one of the best. Easy to learn but hard to master. Overall a great game.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|This was really a great movie! I got it for my 6 year old (he loves nature documentary type movies) and we both loved it. It was a little sad, but it was really neat to see what happens and how Oscar perceivers. I would recommend this to anyone who likes nature movies. I've read reviews putting the narration down, but I honestly liked it.

0345803485|1.0|Here's what you can learn from \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" if you are an aspiring author who wants to write a GOOD book:<br /><br />If writing a fan fiction, leave it in the world of fan fiction. If you absolutely CANNOT do this, and MUST publish it as an original novel, please do more than simply change characters' names and locations. The only thing here that separates Christian from Edward Cullen is the lack of fangs. The only thing that separates Ana from Bella Swan is...wait...nothing.<br /><br />Go through your entire novel and take note of how many times you use the same words over and over again, and then eliminate at least 90% of the instances. While we are on this subject, do NOT use the word \\"murmur\\" multiple times per page. In fact, don't use it at all, especially when it makes no sense. Examples: \\"Hello, Ana, nice to meet you,\\" Christian's mother murmurs. \\"Nice to meet you too, Christian's mother,\\" I murmur. \\"Oh my God, the building is on fire!\\" I murmur. \\"I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico,\\" Christian murmurs. (Some of these sentences may have been fabricated for dramatic effect, and to get my point across.)<br /><br />I don't care how sweet and innocent your Mary-Sue main character is, if she is over age 12, she should never realistically refer to her nether region as \\"down there\\" - especially multiple times! It will make people question whether it's the character or the AUTHOR who is having a hard time using more adult terminology. Either way, it's unacceptable and makes it really hard to take the sex scenes seriously.<br /><br />Do not make your male and female main characters perfect, okay? Christian Grey is young, impossibly beautiful, flies helicopters, plays the piano better than Bach, is a successful businessman worth 16 bajillion dollars, can bring a girl to climax by a single touch or look, smells like roses, and has an appendage that would make Ron Jeremy feel inadequate. In other words, this guy is Fifty Shades of Unrealistic. And Ana, although self-described as being plain and boring and klutzy (hmm, sound like anyone else you may know? *coughBellaSwan*cough*) is adored by any man she meets, and her milkshake apparently brings all the boys to the yard. The fact that somebody like Christian Grey would be so enthralled with a stuffy, plain-looking prude like Ana is beyond far-fetched. At least Edward had the excuse of Bella's blood smelling like a Big Mac.<br /><br />Please don't ever refer to your perfect specimen of a male main character as an \\"Adonis\\". This should be left to fan fictions ONLY! Also, make your female character shut up about her \\"inner goddess\\", unless your novel is about a woman who becomes possessed by the spirit of an actual goddess.<br /><br />Find an editor, a professional one, to read your work before it is published. Have them make changes and corrections. Just because your novel is \\"erotic fiction\\", that doesn't give it a free pass to be horribly written.<br /><br />I could keep going on and on about all of the amazing Writing DONT'S you can learn from in this book, but this review is already too long. Is the book good? No. Is it entertaining? Yes. But for me, it was not entertaining in the same way it was entertaining for thousands of other women out there. If nothing else, this book has really helped me with the editing process of my own novels. I figure, I'll just do the opposite of what E.L. James does, and I should be all set.es of Unrealistic.

B000002NZO|5.0|j'adores ce cd que j'avais oublié un plaisir de renouer avec Genesis la période Peter Gabriel imaginatif et mélodieux à acheter et à écouter.
0345803493|4.0|So I bought my grandmother the kindle and was going through putting a bunch of books on it that I thought she might enjoy. I decided to be funny and purchase 50 shades of gray as a joke to see her reaction when she started reading it, well jokes on me...I had heard so much about these books I thought I would start reading the first book just to see what its about. 3 days later I was done with the first book and purchased the 2nd book. i was actually sad when I finished the first book and will probably go back and read them again after I get through the 3rd book. I loved the first book. I love the dynamic between Christian and Ana. I love how she has to break him down and opens his eyes to new things. I look at it as if I am watching a soap opera, so much happens in the first 3 weeks of their relationship that you would think they had been together for a year. I do prefer the first book just because I liked them getting to know eachother testing boundaries.<br />Now I will admit the writing is not that great, If i had to read the word murmur again I was going to explode. It must be hard to write a book that is over 500 pages but some of the words were used so often it became irritating. There is only one of other book that held my attention as much as these books have and thats The Help. the second book i finished in just 2 days. I was so into these books I had a hard time concentrating on getting things done like errands and tasks. I am purchasing the third book now and I know I need to slow down my reading because I am going to be really sad when I finish it.
B000002J1L|5.0|un très bon cd j'ai longtemps oublié comme j'aime Genesis la période de Peter Gabriel.  Un album inventif très agréable à écouter.  Un plaisir renouvelé.  A very nice cd good and imaginative music.
B000003CMB|5.0|If you like southern rock and good long jams this is for you! Sound quality is outstanding. Packaging is identical to the original release, just not quite 12 inches by 12 inches! If you were ever fortunate enough to see the original band then drop this in the player, crank it up, close your eyes and you are there again!

B007U1FEJE|5.0|I received this CD August 11th and it is so awesome.The Beach Boys still sound so good after 50 years. I always loved them,it took me back to the 60's,highschool and growing up at the beach. Such great harmony even though two of the Wilson brothers are no longer living.I will always remember Dennis Carl Wilson and Carl Dean Wilson from when they were all together just starting out in the early 60's. This CD is just the greatest and I am so glad they recorded it, and I have it.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It's just the four movies, not the tv show.  So why not call it the \\"complete film collection,\\" not \\"the complete adventures\\"?  (I still gave it 5 stars because this gripe isn't enough to de-star it.)
B000SEGUDE|1.0|i couldn't get past the first few pages. this book was listed in the fantasy catagory, i expected witches, vampires, or some such. i couldn't even understand what was written. old english and obscure words, some tale taking place hundreds of years ago on some remote island... i didn't read past page 15 and don't want to. major waste of $12! half the words aren't in usage any more (if they ever were).
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great read.  Of course it can't stand on its own, you need to read all three.  Just saw the movie of the first, The Hunger Games last night...can't wait until the movie for this one is done.  Is this a statement on where our own world could go?  Are there the haves and the have nots?  Pause for consideration.

1416972250|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that although the Jace/Clary relationship had somewhat weirded me out during the first two books, I was secretly rooting for them and waiting for that moment when they could finally be together. For me, however, this book was about far more than their love story. Taking us to Idris and the glamorous city of Alicante, Clare's description of this imaginative place was illuminating. I liked the move from the dark alleys of New York City, where demons in the nighttime are all too expected, to the sun-shiney face of Alicante, where prejudice and hatred run deep beneath the facade. I particularly enjoyed seeing Clary grow up, transforming from a petulant child to a clever and formidable young woman.<br /><br />This book is much darker than the previous two. Even Jace and Simon's witty banter is not enough to lighten up the ominous scenes in this final chapter of the trilogy. Innocent blood is shed, and though the ending brings happiness to most of the central characters, it is not without sacrifice. This was a great read, and I look forward to seeing what else Clare has in store for these characters!

0307592731|5.0|What a treat to finally read an outdoor, wilderness, adventure novel written by a woman!  Cheryl Strayed captures what most male outdoor writers miss - the fact that being in wilderness is about an interpersonal journey, not conquering nature or taking something from it to become your own.  Strayed allows readers into her healing journey that occurs on the Pacific Crest Trail.  The only criticism or thing that irked me a bit is why do books get only written by people who are CLUELESS in the wilderness??  (Into the Wild, Timothy Treadwell, etc...).  Strayed's lack of research before her epic hike, and the dumb, dumb, dumb life threatening things she does (like drink all her water before reaching a now dry water station) is kind of annoying, and I honestly don't know why more books are not written about competent outdoors people!  Other than that, the book is wonderful and Strayed does wisen up along the journey, well, sort of, she continues to make mistake after mistake, but at least writes about knowing she is an idiot!  Strayed's voice is strong, unique, raw and compelling. You don't want to put the book down. I could have done without quite all the childhood belly aching, but that really is what her journey is about - overcoming a bad childhood with an abusive father (no wonder its an Oprah book club pick since Oprah is addicted to child abuse books which I am frankly sick to death of...).  However Wild didn't annoy me like some whine-about-my-bad-upbringing tales...And it is beyond refreshing for someone like me, avid hiker, camper, adventure, to read about a WOMAN doing these things!  Her perspective as a woman rubs off on the entire book.  This is a great, fun read that any adventurous soul will enjoy.  You will cheer on Strayed from beginning to end.  Let's get more books like this published!!

B003YOZNBU|4.0|I was never a big Jonah Hex fan, but I have a handful of the comics from the 70s and was therefore mildly interested in this cinematic adaption from 2010, especially since Megan Fox looked so good in the promo pics, lol.<br /><br />\\"Jonah Hex\\" reminds me of those gazillions of spaghetti Westerns from the 60s and 70s, like \\"Django\\" and Leone's \\"Man with No Name\\" trilogy except that it's more modern and entertaining.<br /><br />To be expected, the atmosphere is very comic booky and the filmmakers do an outstanding job with the title character's hideously scarred face. It's like the comic come to life. Josh Brolin is fine in the eponymous role. On top of this, Megan Fox proves in her peripheral part that she's the foxiest ultra-babe on the face of the planet. Did I already mention this?<br /><br />At only 82 minutes, the story is simple and the pace is fast, which I don't mind since too many films overstay their welcome. But the writers did strive for some depth and that's commendable. If there was more depth and epic-ness I wouldn't hesitate to raise my rating. As it is, \\"Jonah Hex\\" plays like a spaghetti Western that's actually decent. Imagine the style and pizazz of \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" updated to 2010, but half as long, no tedious stretches and less one-dimensional characters and you'd have a pretty good approximation of \\"Jonah Hex.\\"<br /><br />One of the film's highlights is the incredible metalized score by Marco Beltrami and none other than Mastodon. The movie's worth seeing for the music alone, no kidding.<br /><br />The film was shot in Louisiana with some re-shoots in California.<br /><br />GRADE: B

B007UQRW62|5.0|The \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" 60th Anniversary collection is truly a beautiful tribute to the making of this film and its classic story.  Besides having a beautiful remastered film presentation the many extra features that are included in this special set are worthwhile in their own rights to see and enjoy.  They only add to the beauty of this classic film.  I highly recommend it to anyone who truly enjoyed seeing this film.
B003RV43X4|4.0|I watched this on my TV through prime. I like the movie. I just recently watched the second, and I like both. I'm not that much of a fan of prime to prefer it over netflix or redbox. I like this movie though. it's not great, but it's good and I like the mythology and how they incorporate that into the story. Special affects are good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much that I have it on my moms phone and one on the kindle and I also have every were ito
B000U0O9FM|3.0|Had seen the movie at least a dozen times so I decided to read the book.<br /><br />More often then not, the book is better then the movie, but this is the exception.<br /><br />The movie has a more congruent timeline and *spoiler alert* no love story.<br /><br />For those 2 reasons skip the book unless you have a burning desire to be disappointed.
B004RKXN44|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />I've been wanting Hawke's story since the very beginning when we first met him and Sienna.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed in their story at all. I knew Hawke and Sienna would be difficult because Hawke already had his mate and Sienna is not exactly in control of her abilities. My heart ached for these two on several occasions but the love they have for each other is so obviously there, you want everything to be okay even though you think there's no hope. Hawke is so stubborn and forceful that it was funny how Sienna stood up to him. Sienna is just as stubborn, though, so it was like two battering rams sometimes. Still, Hawke knew how to handle Sienna in every situation and Sienna was able to take Hawke as he is, cruel sometimes and tender others.<br /><br />The plot still revolves around the Pure Psy targeting SnowDancer. We learn so much in this book because just about every Psy that is apart of Pure Psy is revealed which was somewhat shocking at times. How far the Pure Psy go to take out SnowDancer is incredibly baffling but SnowDancer fights back harder. Loyalties are shown and tested and relationships are created. The whole conflict with keeping Sienna's abilities a secret is fascinating because her abilities are so unique but I really enjoyed learning more about them.<br /><br />While I loved the story very much, I had a few niggles. For one, this is a dual story. You get Hawke/Sienna and Walker/Lara. I was actually a little disappointed with that because I feel like we got cheated out of Walker and Lara's story. I've been wanting Walker's story for so long as well but I didn't feel like we got to know much about him and that made me really sad because if Walker is essentially more dangerous than Judd, can you imagine what mischief he can create with his own book?! Even if it was a novella instead of a novel?! So, that was one thing. Another thing is, Hawke and Sienna had sex a lot. Granted it was hot but I would have liked more interactions outside of groping, kissing and smexing. I was just extremely surprised that this book had way more sex than any other in the series, at least as far as I remember.<br /><br />Even with that said, I really loved the book. Hawke is so dominating and Sienna is so dangerous, the two are definitely soul mates. Walker and Lara are so cute together and the way Walker was courting Lara when he didn't understand it was adorable. Still love the series and can't wait for more.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I normally don't take the time to write a review but, this one is worth it. Really,  the info that this app provides is a lifesaver (ok maybe not that great) but the point is that at a glance I can determine what or what not to start. I have a KF &amp; it works fine. Ok enough writing ... JUST GET IT!!!!
B00722ZHG6|5.0|This one is for humanity. A voice so sweet and so delicate you wonder how you're so moved. You wonder where this young girl can draw up such a voice.<br /><br />It almost hurts me to listen to her voice. Sometimes beauty is piercing the way it comes at you. Her selection of songs is just wonderful. You cannot help but think you've never thought of these songs this way before.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|Once again Blake kept me on the edge of my seat all the way to the end! I read Pines in one sitting because there was no way I could put it down until I knew how it came out. If you haven't read anything by Blake Crouch this is a good one to start with. You won't be able to read just one!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. Upgrading adding new things just overall a fun game. Would reccomend this to anyone
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's quirky, witty, funny, colorful, and if you're going through a bit of an existential thing-it's kind of uplifting.<br /><br />It was nice to see Owen Wilson as the clueless, lost, hopeful main character, even though I do enjoy his signature cocky characters as well. Rachel McAdams is so deliciously mean in this movie! Not the sweet, girl-next-door character that she more frequently plays. Marion Cotillard is lovely as always, and Adrien Brody as the rhino-obsessed Salvador Dali is hilarious.<br /><br />You might not like it if you're a fancy, snobby amateur film critic, but check it out if you're a simple-minded commoner like myself who enjoys colorful movies with quirky characters, good music, and an interesting plot.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The characters are so easy to hate, the writing sucks, but the plot and sex scenes are what keeps you reading.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|A friend posted Ben Howard's rendition of Call Me Maybe on FB which I enjoyed a lot; much more adult with the beautiful cello. I started checking out his other songs on YouTube and found that his writing and playing are extraordinary. All of the group are very skilled musicians and the music is poetic and transporting. I have not heard music that moves me like this in a long time.
0307341550|3.0|I saw all the raves for Gone Girl, but started to read this book by the same author first. It is a good book, but really spoiled by the author's unnecessary graphic descriptions of a woman in her 30's taking the drug ecstasy and other illegal substances with her just over 12 year old sister. What was the value of that---as well as the sexual discussions/descriptions of this same barely 13 year old. It added nothing to the demented characters in the book and really just made me dislike all of the characters even though I think the intention was for the reader to feel sorry for them.  Dislike the author now as well since the twisted, unentertaining narrative is exploitative and plodding.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|my hubby is a scotty fan...he loves this cd and plays it all the time..great sounds and good songs..if a man can like it that much
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Absolutely the finest Christmas tale of all time, and amazingly, one which has more often than not been successfully transferred to screens of varying genres, ages and formats for an enormous number of decades.<br />Move over \\"A Night Before Christmas\\" cos daylight finished second in this enduro and even the best of the rest are so far to the rear as none might reasonably be considered for a place!<br />Absolutely awesome, absolutely feel good and absolutely unmawkish too.
076115678X|5.0|I received the book, read and started enjoying the differences in my hair.  It is nice to understand exactly what kind of hair I have, and treat it accordingly.  Well Done!
030758836X|4.0|Great book, really well-written and thought provoking.<br /><br />I see a lot of complaints about the ending but I liked the ending.  It would have been super easy for Flynn to just contrive some sort of stupid neat finishing scene where everything gets tidy and clean, but the situation and relationship aren't tidy and clean.  It ends with a certain noir inevitably...<br /><br />She ended it the right way, not the easy way, and the book is brilliantly written throughout.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie was a complete sucess. Not only did they do each character justice, they gave each character some depth. They each had there own personal issues for not joining up originally before the common ground brought them together. Adding the internal team conflict was great too and didn't seem forced like some movies. This allowed at least a little view into how the hero's would match up against each other as every comic fan always wonders. Just an all around great movie right up to the end with the extra seen. I will watch this movie over and over again over the years.
0143119680|4.0|I just finished this book last night and I understand a lot of the complaints in some of the reviews. For a while there in the beginning, there wasn't much going on but a whole lot of exposition, some of which was definitely unnecessary. That's why I took off one star. However, when this book picks up, it picks way up! There were some nights when I was reading the second half and I couldn't put it down and I was begging my kindle battery to hold out.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of fantasy novels starring creatures. Twilight? Not ashamed to admit I love it. True Blood? Heck yes! Harry Potter? You better believe it! Most of the time I'd rather read these stories than watch a movie or TV show. After reading all the Twilight and Harry Potter books, I was looking for something similar and I heard about The Discovery of Witches. Unlike other hyped up novels (cough 50 Shades of Gray cough), this book is actually well written and it's evident that the author put a lot of work and research into the novel. As a teacher, I'm a fan of books that can entertain and teach you at the same time.<br /><br />I won't get into any plot synopsis since many reviewers have already done so. I will just say that if you enjoy reading about magic, witches, vampires, etc then you will probably enjoy this. Stick it out even when you feel like not reading the book anymore because the ending is worth going through the beginning. As soon as I was finished, I purchased the 2nd book and I'm looking forward to starting it.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|This movie has to be watched from the very beginning with no Interruptions There are so many subtleties that are to clever, witty, creative and imaginative, and they should not be missed. You can watch it over and over, and see new things every time. You just have to see Puss's eyes. Sooo Cute! It is so well done, the cartooning is so amazing. The story is original and funny. I am buying this for my father's birthday. It is the best thing since the Bugs Bunny cartoons. I just LOVED this!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is awesome and really addictive and I swear once you start playing you won't be able to stop!its also pretty funny!so if you do get it then I hope you like it!ALOT!!!:):):):)
0143119680|3.0|I'll be honest- I am the type who loved Twilight and Hunger Games. I am also a huge Charlaine Harris Sookie Stackhouse novel fan. So one would say I was bound to enjoy this book on vampires, witches and other supernaturals.<br /><br />While entertaining at times, and I believe worth a read--there was a lot that could have been edited out. The story was drawn out and over the top at times. Other times you'd squirm in your seat at how sweet and innocent a love like theirs was.<br /><br />If you liked twilight, hunger games, Sookie Stackhouse series, etc-- then I think you'd enjoy this book if you take it for what it is-- entertainment. I'm looking forward to the sequel.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|In the book The Forever Girl I immediately connected with the main character. She is unusual but I still could relate to her. Most characters in fiction don't have this depth but with The Forever Girl all of the characters are very well developed. I loved seeing the story about Charles parents Henry and Valeria and the backstory of some of Sophia's friends. I related to Sophia the most and the characters all reminded me of pieces of people I know in my life. It was actually kind of eerie.<br /><br />This was an action packed novel. I couldn't put it down because of the fast pace and interesting elements. The ghost following Sophia really kept me on my toes the whole time! I was rooting for Sophia from the start of the book when she had to deal with being judged for her religion, but she was strong about it and had a sense of humor about things.<br /><br />Sophia isn't perfect but she's a smart girl, and she needs to trust her instincts more! Sometimes she would trust Charles and that was bad because Charles could be too trusting sometimes. I think that sometimes people get older but that doesn't make them wiser. I liked that Charles wasn't perfect either because sometimes the men in fiction are perfect and the heroines are just dumb. This was a great change to that!<br /><br />It was refreshing that that Sophia wasn't another teen girl who wants to be a vampire like her boyfriend. Even though she wanted Charles to change for her she never pushed him and in the end she accepted how things were. I felt bad for Charles because he doesn't even like being immortal. Sophia and Charles both have to let go their previous lives if they want to be together forever. They make such a perfect couple! Neither one of them is perfect but they are in love for the right reasons.<br /><br />I liked that Sophia didn't have telepathy because that would have been too obvious. The voices end up being something much cooler. There is lots of cool magic in this story, like clairaudience andignesvisam.<br /><br />I don't want to post a spoiler but I think it's neat that Sophia and Charles end up being a lot closer in age then it seemed at first! I know age is just a number but there's a lot of century old people with teens in books these days and yes age is just a number and it's different with immortals in fiction but when they ended up not being that different in age I thought that was cool and unique for this book genre.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this book besides the story is that everyone has strength and weaknesses. I will read the next books, I want to see what happens for these characters next. I am going to miss them until book two is here for reading.
B004HO6I2E|2.0|I love Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds, and I have no problem with crudity, nudity, foul language, etc...but this was a train wreck.  The humor and the plot were tired and obvious.  Stuff you've seen a million times before.  The F-word is fine, but it seems like they went out of their way to cram it into every sentence.  It got annoying.  Everything was so over the top.  No one, anywhere, ever, would act the way the Jason Bateman does in front of a child.  Even for a dumb R-comedy, it was unbelievable.  You know those two 15-year-olds down the block who think they're funny but really just bug the hell out of everyone?  This is the movie they would make.<br /><br />The worst of all is this: because of the body switch, each actor is playing a part better cast for the other.  I don't buy Jason Bateman as a womanizing dirt bag, and I don't buy Reynolds as a corporate attorney, but after they switch bodies, that's what you get for the majority of the movie.  It would have been better to cast the actors in opposite roles at the beginning and then switch them.  They would have been much funnier in their roles.<br /><br />There are a million other things wrong with this, but I'll save you the time.  Save yourself the time as well and skip this.  Watch \\"Waiting\\" instead.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|It is by far one of the best books I read! It caught me by surprise and I got transposed in their life and I was laughing and suffering, and I was happy and crying...<br />I loved it!<br />I was personally \\"slammed\\" by life, hard and it hurt but with time I learned to live the life again.<br />Congrats to the writer for creating this masterpiece!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not my cup of tea.  S&M just doesn't work for me.  Bought all 3 books, now what do I do with them. Read them all now they just sit.  Has anyone figured out what to do with used Kindle books?
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I was surprised when I saw so many 1 & 2 star reviews for The Hunger Games here at Amazon. I just watched the movie, and for me it was so good that I look forward to watching it again on Blu Ray with my family. Then I looked at some of the negative reviews, and it turns out that most of them can be grouped into three common themes. Let me just say that this is a great movie, and you should at minimum get it into your rental queue. And since there are already hundreds of reviews at this time to tell you what The Hunger Games is about, l will address some of the relatively common, silly complaints that The Hunger Games is getting....<br /><br />Silly Complaint #1 - \\"Waaaah: The movie is not as good as the book.\\" Really? The movie was excellent! If every detail and characterization from the book was transferred to the screen we'd have ended up with a 10 hour movie instead of just over a 2 hour movie. Sometimes liberties need to be taken for a film adaptation in order to keep the action moving, and the action indeed moves at a quick pace in the movie. And, look, Suzanne Collins co-wrote the script, so I'd say the integrity of the novel holds quite strong in the film.<br /><br />Silly Complaint #2 - \\"Boo hoo: The Hunger Games is a rip off of [[ASIN:B006L4MX4A Battle Royale]].\\" I had heard that there was some controversy that Battle Royale was an uncredited inspiration for The Hunger Games, so I grabbed the opportunity to check out Battle Royale and....It turns out that while the concept that pulled me into the Battle Royale hype was cool, ultimately the movie was as hokey as I've seen in quite a while. The script that the concept bloomed is terribly formulated. The story flow is discombobulated. And the acting is...well?....It seems like the concept of selecting a random middle school class to participate in a free-for-all deathmatch was the same concept used to select who the actors would be in the movie; in a word, the acting in Battle Royale was atrocious. The Hunger Games is the opposite of Battle Royale in these respects: The Hunger Games is well put together, well acted & well directed. The Hunger Games is exciting, action packed and I thoroughly enjoyed all 2 hours and 20 minutes from start to finish.<br /><br />Complaint #3 (notice that I didn't say \\"silly\\" complaint this time?) - No one seems to be happy with the relatively new Ultraviolet digital media format that much of Hollywood has adapted to, and I'd have to agree that when I purchase a digital copy I don't want to have to stream it from the Cloud. A lot of the negative 1 & 2 star reviews here at Amazon for this movie are an outcry against said format. As a result, the average number of stars that this movie is getting is unjustly lower based on the outcry to this format that Hollywood has taken to versus the quality of the movie. So don't be mislead by almost 100 (as of this writing) 1 & 2 star reviews that have more to do with digital format than they do movie content.<br /><br />Do check this movie out if you're into the action/thriller genres. I'm glad that I purchased it instead of dealing with the \\"very long wait\\" at Netflix.Games is the opposite of Battle Royale in these respects: The Hunger Games is well put together, well acted & well directed.

B007SAKSF2|5.0|I've been a Blur fan since I was 9 years old. All the remasters sound great and the rarities are excellent as well. I would say it is a bit pricy, however this isn't something a true Blur fan could pass up.
B0063GORYU|2.0|Spider solitaire is a great game but this app is flawed. If you have played the Microsoft version then you know that the initial deal should be random. This app does not deal a random setup. It is always contrived to thwart progress. I always play four suits. On Windows I can win about 25% of the time. With this application only about 15%.
B001706I5I|5.0|This is a great Christmas movie for all ages. Great message about the \\"Christmas spirit\\". Even us older ones who watched the original \\"Grinch Who Stole Christmas\\"... This movie lives up to the \\"Sesussians\\" standards. Jim Carey plays a great role. Great cast all around and well directed. Fun and lively Christmas movie for young and old alike. This is a great way for us older ones to revisit the past in a good way and also it is great that they have brought this particular movie back for all the younger generations now. Every time I watch it; it becomes more and more funny. It definitely gets you in the Christmas spirit.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I'm very disappointed in this product. I own the G600 mouse, z5500 speaker system, g15 and g510 keyboards. I've always had positive results with Logitech and remained faithful to them through the years... until now.<br /><br />My headset and the software are garbage. Everything you say into the mic is repeated in the headset with a 1 sec delay. There are no windows options settings to remedy this. The drivers and software are buggy as well.<br /><br />Customer support, usually fast and friendly, are non-existent on this issue. I've not heard back from them in over a week.<br /><br />Battery life is not as advertised. I've yet to get >2 hours out of mine.<br /><br />You used to be able to get quality products that worked as advertised for $100. Now a days, you get rushed products with fail support.<br /><br />On a positive... they sound amazing. I'll not buy another headset. I've yet to get one that is decent in both mic and sound. I'll jest buy a table top mic next go around.
B005UKMWMY|3.0|I give it a 3 star because I hated it but my wife loves it. I think House is an arrogant d-bag, and likes to berate patients instead of helping them. When I see a doctor I want it to be somebody who cares, and who doesn't guilt me for being sick; whatever the choices I have made.<br /><br />The wife on the other hand loves the cheap drama and the suspense. As a professional person, I don't think this is a realistic story that could happen in the medical community.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|this movie has so many elements and issues to it from child innocence, puppy love, murder, bullying and the ugly, dark side that vampires were supposed to seem unlike the way we view them today. its honestly worth seeing, its not the same overused, happy fairy tail ending. this movie has so many unexpected twists and it fixes everyone's subtitle phobia for those to lazy to actually read the subtitles for the original movie\\"Let The Right One In\\" :P all in all, its a really good movie.
B001QOGYFY|3.0|Maybe I just expected mroe out of the movie, but I didn't find anything about it to be thrilling, heart pounding, or even unexpected. Just kind of an average movie to watch if you're bored...which I was.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|Not sexy like a Core i5 or i7, but 3.3 GHz, runs fast and cool..... be nice if it came with a higher HD graphics chipset and the ability to use more shared RAM, but gets the job done.  Since Turbo Boost is not possible, the standard fan/heatsink is more than sufficient.  Bottom line:  great Budget CPU from Intel
006056251X|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE Devil in Winter! Total Reforming a Rake theme. Plus the heroine has a stutter that you can't help but feel for her.  However there is hidden strength in her that the hero recognizes from the start.  You really see how protective Sebastian becomes of Evie throughout the book. It is my absolute fave Lisa Kleypas and possibly romance novel ever and have re-read it a few times already (about 7 times and counting). I just adore the relationship between Evie and Sebastian to pieces. They really are two halves of a whole.  Sebastian really helped Evie become confident and found worth in his love. Sebastian just became a better man all around, a man who found his purpose thanks to Evie. They seriously are my fave couple in Kleypas's world and possibly my top couple in all the romance books I've read.<br /><br />I read the follow up books (Scandal in Spring and Wallflower Christmas) just because you get to see them in those books as well.  Their sweet love scene in Wallflower in Christmas was worth the price of the book alone. In those books, Kleypas always emphasizes the intimate connection both Evie and Sebastian have with each other.  I just can't get enough of these two.

B0028KF4M4|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  I heard about it from some friends at work and started to watch season 1.  I have been hooked every since.  The plot is great and the actors are all top notch.  The show is not as bloody as expected and focuses more on the killer and the justification for their demise.
1451683405|4.0|Free Will/Won't  -----  a different angle<br />Before  language  we lived in groups and members cooperated. When we  learned more efficient cooperation it was due to improvements in  communication of  what  the different organisms  intended to do. It was done by  by  signs,  sounds and, later,  words.  The intensions/decisions were  formed in the (sub)conscious  workings of that organism.<br />With  time,  we got better and better in communications and  we even created a word for  the 'announcement':  'I' !  But that did not mean that we added a function to our organism:  an  'I'  that  suddenly could deliberate and  decide about things!<br />Through 1000s of years we then used  'I'  to  give agency to decisions that were communicated and  then we  started to believe that  what  was  communicated  was really made by  'I',  as we had little idea about how a decision came to.<br />We are still in that situation;  most people have no idea about how an organism makes decisions....they just assume  that  'I'  did it.<br />And .... As  'I'  did it...'I'  have Free Will.<br />Voila!<br />But.....<br />My organism is still doing decisions in the same way as it has done for 1000s of years! Only  better due to access  to more information.<br />A big confusion  was created when  this witnessing  and announcing function of my organism's deliberations and  decisions  was also supposed to have  the powers to do them; i.e.  when the announcement  got the confusing ID:  'I' ?  Or  rather:  Who is there to have Free Will?  There is no one!<br />Without  anybody  to  own the  Free Will/Won't mechanism; it  can not exist.<br />But my organism will continue to make decisions and  announce them and  many people will continue to believe that a Free Will decision has been announced.

B00846REIS|5.0|Having read the 50 shades trilogy (which I really liked), I have to say I think this story is better - - my new favorite couple >>GIDEON and Eva.  Mind you, as I have read in previous readers reviews, there are so MANY perfect people in the book that it is unrealistic.  But, I don't read it for reality - I'm living that - I read for escape.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book to find out what Gideon's deep, dark issues are (although I think we can surmise what happened to him in his youth).<br /><br />I savored this book so I'm buying more Sylvia Day!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Read this and other reviews at [...]<br /><br />This was one of those series where I finished it in record time, felt like someone punched me in the gut and then proceeded to immediately Google and then stalk the author to find out if there was going to be more, because I NEEDED MORE! Slammed is beyond words amazing. There isn't much I can say to do this story justice, honestly. I had never been so moved. This is one of those stories that you just have to read to be able to fully appreciate. No summary I give can describe the awesomeness.<br /><br />Slammed is one of the most heartwarming and at the same time, gut-ripping stories of intense love, loss and growing up and apart and together. The relationships in this book are so dynamic - all of them - siblings, parents to children, boyfriends to girlfriends. You fall in love with all the love. Will, doing the right thing by his parents and his brother, and his maturity and passion are both deliciously sexy, but also just so endearing. Layken, has such passion for life, her brother, her mother, and Will - she is strong but also insecure and I loved watching her grow up and change during the story. Eddie, Layken's best friend, is in your face, powerful and so, so smart. The brothers, Kel & Caulder - they're just fun and young and their innocence reminds me of what I miss about being a kid. I lastly have to mention Layken and Kel's mom - I hope to someday be that kind of mom to my children. She is strong (so much stronger than I could imagine), full of amazing advice and loves hard and unconditionally.<br /><br />I love the concept of slam poetry and the way that its use enhances the story is beyond fantastic. Being a fan of poetry (having studied a lot of it during my time in college) I appreciated how Colleen used this to teach us so much about the characters, but also bring them together and pull them apart. It was so much more interesting to learn about the characters through their poetry; definitely a unique view, aside from typical dialogue or internal monologue. Side note: also love the use of Avett Brothers throughout the entire story - the references, the quotes at the beginning of each chapter and the connection it gave Will & Lake. I'm a fan of the Avett Brothers, so this was a fantastic find for me when I started the book! Music is powerful, and when combined with a beyond amazing story, you are transported somewhere beautiful!<br /><br />And just for some technical awesomeness - the writing is superb, the dialogue is powerful, funny, witty and just the bomb, and the storyline sucks you in and just when you think it might be like any other romance, with some unattainable love, you're b**ch-slapped into a different twist. So, really, I give this book 5 stars, and would give it so much more, because it really is one of the most captivating collection of characters, storylines and plot twists that I've read in awhile. I cannot wait to see what Colleen has for us next and much congratulations must be given to her for recently having Slammed and book #2 Point of Retreat being acquired by Simon & Schuster. I'm not surprised she'd be picked up by a publisher in only 8 months after writing this, but it's a true testament to the fabulous group of indie writers that we are currently blessed with these days! Pick this up now, and I promise you will NOT be disappointed!gue or internal monologue.

B006XF5BTG|3.0|I'm becoming more of a skeptic as each day passes.  Like some others have said, not enough \\"proof\\" and too much anecdotal stuff.  I'd like to see testimonials from all those Mike has worked with.  I'd like to see more than a P.O. Box in Florida.  Mike needs to open up more and reveal himself.  This would make the whole experience more real.  I've started the 1 year workout this week and I feel like I'm leaving the gym entirely too early.  I don't have near the pump as I did in my previous workout and I'm just skeptical that this is the plan for me.  I want more functional stuff; not just to pack on lean muscle as it states in the book over and over and over...Sure I want to look good but the real success is in performing well.  Does Mike participate in any sports?  No idea.  Just real skeptical at this point and I know Mike will chime in within minutes of my posting this review so maybe we'll get some frankness and a few answers.  Also, too many emails with links to other stuff.  Too much marketing to the point that I'm becoming uncomfortable with it.

The faq looks like a little child wrote the page..<br /><br />I haven't recive noting at all saying they can fix the problem..<br /><br />I have deleted the game more than 10 time to see if sn update was made to amazon website so far I guess not.<br /><br />I downloaded google play store off the web and install the software, also made an account with google still I cannot download the update from them.  WHY,  because the kindle fire is not supported by google store.<br /><br />I don't understand why gameloft would do something like this and not support the problem they created ..<br /><br />So right now I am posses at gameloft for NOT doing the right thing which is to help the people that love the game..<br /><br />I am going to guess that money comes first and the bulls comes after..<br /><br />So for the people like me who have a kindle fire we are at the end of the s*** pile...

B006LSZECO|1.0|This book started out good, got bogged down and was slow in the middle, and then picked up toward the end.  But (the dreaded but...), the big disappointment was the ending.  Not every book has to have a \\"rosy\\" ending, but this book ended horribly.  My immediate thought as I finished the book was \\"now that was a big waste of time.\\"  It was as if I had a bad taste in my mouth for awhile after finishing the book.  I have read books before that I didn't care for, but could understand the hype.  This book, I don't understand the hype at all.  I'm much relieved that the book I am reading now is wonderful -- just what I needed.

159102594X|4.0|It used to be, and not all that long ago, that \\"fantasy\\" meant Tolkien. And maybe C. S. Lewis. And then, around the late 1970s, a whole slew of new varieties of fantasy rather suddenly began to appear -- darker, sometimes in an urban setting, featuring protagonists who weren't especially high and noble, nor clothed in glittering raiment and carrying shining swords. Sometimes there weren't even any identifiable Good Guys, just as the heroes of noir detective stories weren't especially Good. (Just successful.) I find most noir fantasy to be a lot more interesting, frankly, than Tolkien and his many clones. It all seems a lot closer to the so-called real world. Abercrombie is new at this but he seems to have a knack for sword-and-sorcery with grit added in.<br /><br />There are three principal characters: Logen, known as \\"Ninefingers\\" for readily apparent reasons, is a Northerner, which translates as \\"barbarian\\" to those in the more traditionally civilized Southern cultures. He's managed to survive into middle age (his mantra in a tight situation is \\"Not dead yet\\") but he's also getting tired. Now homeless and alone, following his most recent escape from those who want him dead, he's following a summons by Bayaz, First of the Magi, who looks more like a village butcher than a wizard -- but he's really not someone you want to annoy. Second is San dan Glotka, once a champion swordsman and a colonel in the army of the Union, before he was captured by the Imperials and tortured for more than a year. Now, crippled and in constant agony, he has become an inquisitor, a profession at which he appears to be very capable. (Takes one to know one when it comes to torture, apparently.) His own constant thought is \\"Why do I do this?\\" He sometimes makes the higher-ups in the Inquisition nervous because he's entirely past being frightened by pain or even threat of death. Finally, there's Capt. Jezal dan Luthar, a typically narrow-minded and empty-headed young member of the aristocracy who has been training for months for the annual Summer  Contest, in which the year's greatest swordsman will be determined by competitive elimination. Such men in the past have frequently risen to high office in the Union, so it's largely a matter of ambition. Luthar, however, is also capable of change, given the right motivation -- which, in this case, is the rather common and coarse sister of his colleague, Major West. Even though their social stations are vastly different and marriage is not an option, he can't help falling in love with her.<br /><br />The background to the story is the growth in power among the Northerners, now being led by their first-ever king, who craves victory over their old enemy, the Union. At the same time, there's a new and viciously successful emperor in power on the Union's opposite border, their traditional enemy. The king's younger officers, plus most of the nobility, assume both their enemies can be beaten in time for lunch. Bayaz knows different, and so do the more thoughtful decision-makers. And that's where this first volume of the trilogy ends, with everyone going off to war -- or almost everyone. Bayaz has a quest in mind that could Change Everything, and he recruits Ninefingers and Luthar to assist him. Glotka, meanwhile is being sent off to shore up the loyalty of a shaky province bordering the empire. But one gets the definite impression that all these major figures will be coming together before long.<br /><br />Abercrombie treats his characters as \\"real world\\" people, even those who are weird even to their peers, and he has a talent for internal dialogue. The narrative is a little stiff in places, but he has done an excellent job for a first-timer. And I have the second and third volumes already waiting on my bookshelf.who has been training for months for the annual Summer  Contest, in which the year's greatest swordsman will be determined by competitive elimination.

B0086700CM|4.0|It is a fun game for kids of all ages.  My 2 year old granddaughter thinks she is playing it and I think she plays better than her Papa(me).  My other grandkids and their parents also like it.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|I must admit that I liked the movie a bit better than the book.  I thought the book was decent, but not great.  The movie was a bit better than decent, but still not great.  Sure, I enjoyed watching it...but I'm not sure how often I will go back and watch it again.  The characters just aren't that compelling, either in print or screen (yes, I know they are for many, but that's my opinion) and the plot is not overly complicated.<br /><br />I'm sure that some people will jump up and down and say that they have no idea why I'm not wild about this movie (or book).  It does seem to me that this book/movie is well liked by a wide population...but for those of us who read sf/fantasy all of the time, its nothing much new.  Which is sad.  It had the seeds of greatness.<br /><br />(SPOILERS)<br /><br />One of th biggest issues is that we all know from the beginning what will happen.  That Katniss will jump in for her sister.  That she will win in the end.  That changing the rules so that both she and Peeta can win would be changed once it came down to the two of them.  There weren't any real surprises.  I'd forgive a lot with more real twists and turns in the plot.<br /><br />There were also a few problems with the world as portrayed.  For one, why would the Capitol with its super advanced techology (heck, they have a giant holodeck that is so real it can kill you) need old-fashioned coalminers?  There is no way that a city with that kind of technology would still be powered by burning coal.  Now, if it had been emphasized that they had the remnants of techology that was breaking down slowly but surely so that they had to make do and power it now with machines cobbled together that needed coal...well, maybe.  The writer needed to have thought this out or maybe they could have added something in when they made the movie.  It could have made for a richer story.<br /><br />Also, the basic premise of let's play this game and have children kill each other as entertainment for theCapitol and to prove a point to the Districts...why?  Why create anything approximating a hero?  That's just asking for trouble.  The whole plot point about giving them just a little hope, but not enough, didn't make much sense.<br /><br />Loved the look of the Capitol, especially the strange colors of hair and makeup and the costumes.  Beautiful and creepy at the same time.  The woods in the Arena was beautiful (if deadly).  Loved Rue.  Loved Katniss.<br /><br />The saddest part is that this could have been so much better a story and movie if they had gone further and ended with the Districts actually revolting against the Capitol, with Katniss becoming the key leader in overthrowing them...perhaps, that's meant to come later, but it would have made the movie better to have taken another half hour and ended it properly.  Or hinted at the end that she would lead a revolutation against them.  Just a few minute scene of her obviously making up her mind to stand against them once again...as she did when she refused to fight Peeta.<br /><br />Could have been great.

B0083GQ2A0|3.0|I rented \\"The Grey\\" and was really looking forward to it.  I had heard a lot about it, and only one or two of the people I spoke to said they didn't really like it.  The movie had me intrigued from the opening scenes: a tired, conflicted man somewhere in the arctic hunting wolves and drinking.  My intrigue began to wane however, and eventually deflated to disappointment in a movie that had a lot of potential.  Here's the good and the not so good.<br /><br />Good:<br />Interesting story.  Liam Neeson did well portraying a man conflicted and maybe a little broken trying to make up for past mistakes but not quite sure how to do so.  As I said earlier, the opening scenes of the movie draw the viewer in and you begin to wonder where the story will take you.  The stories and different personalities of the other characters on the plane added to the story and character development, and the plane crash had some good tension building aspects.<br /><br />Bad:<br />After the plane crash, the movie takes a sharp left turn and goes downhill.  As anyone who's seen the previews knows, this movie is based on survival against nature and wolves.  While one doesn't expect today's action movies to be extremely realistic, the wolves portrayed in this movie were the size of bears.  Again, I know it's a movie and maybe the size of the wolves could be said to be symbolic, but much of the tension and suspense of a movie like this is generated through the audience identifying something in the movie that could be real, something that could actually happen.  Being chased down by wolves the size of grizzlies is not very likely to happen unless you've decided to partake of certain street pharmaceuticals.  My other large complaint and dissatisfaction with the film was that it felt like it couldn't decide what kind of movie it was going to be.  At times the movie felt more like a mindless action movie.  Awesome!  I love action movies.  But then only a scene later the movie becomes poetic and deeplyepic.  Which is fine too, but these two elements were never melded together so the movie becomes choppy, going from slaughtering things with no remorse to reciting rhymes and poems the main character's father taught him.  The most frustrating part about the movie was that it had so much potential to be so much more.  If the director had had a more clear vision of what he wanted the movie to be, and stayed with it, it could have been a great movie.  Instead we're left with an attempt at capturing a great classic of conflict: man vs. nature, but with distractions and no clear path the whole way.  The circumstances leading up to the ending of the movie seemed to be haphazardly thrown together, but the actual ending of the movie was well done.  It was a huge reason why I was frustrated with the unrealized potential of the film.  If the director had used the ending, which was just open ended enough to leave you thinking after the movie has been returned, and built everything around that, it would have been great.  Alas I think the days of story being more important than explosions and giant wolves are gone.  Gone are the Hitchcocks.  I was just hoping for more.

030758836X|1.0|Loved the way the book started; grabbed your attention right away!  The characters were interesting, the writing  was good.  I had downloaded the sample on my Kindle and was intrigued enough to purchase the book but, boy, did I get taken!!  Once it got to the middle, it seems to have gone off the tracks.  The characters became almost cartoonish, the story became ridiculous and completely unbelievable.  The ending was almost bizarre, as though the author just threw up her hands and wanted to finish writing quickly so she put down anything.  A HUGE disappointment!  Felt I threw away my money!  Will NOT buy anything else from this author.<br /><br />Pat in Southern CA

0307456625|5.0|Modern fiction that is not full of crass vulgarities or brimming with sexual excess.  This is a fine work of fiction.  A story, or rather stories, told well.  And told with a gentle tone and great charm.  It does not hide from all life's hardness but it approaches what it encounters with a deft literary hand.  Kudos to Alexander McCall Smith for creating interesting stories that draw readers in, and for giving us characters that we might actually want to meet.
1932100660|5.0|I never generally write reviews, but this book is a life changer. I read this after seeing the documentary Forks Over Knives. After reading it I was convinced to switch to a mostly vegan diet. Campbell recommends going fully vegan and a low fat diet. I have done additional research and so you can see I don't fully agree with his conclusions. I think healthy fats and a little fish would enhance the nutritonal value of the diet he recommends. However, the research in this book is extremely compelling to limit your animal protein consumption. I think it's a shame that the information shared in this book hasn't really hit the mainstream audience for nutritional information. A lot of lives and suffering could be saved if everyone had this information.

B0085A9HXS|5.0|I'm not sure what I can add to the heaps of praise thrown on this movie. It is one of the best action movies of all time. Evans has a good eye for action, and he showcases several memorable moments in this movie. The machete/wall scene is truly suspenseful. This movie is just plain fun, and that is it's biggest strength.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is also great, tons of extras, a very, very informative and entertaining commentary track from Evans, and the option to choose which soundtrack you want to use. The subtitles are given a black border around them and it makes them so much easier to read, especially for someone like me who is a bit color blind, and sometimes has trouble seeing the letters on subtitles as they sometimes blend into lighter backgrounds.

0375869026|5.0|I read this book with my 6-year-old during the summer just before he started 1st grade.  One the one hand, I wish we had shared this when he was a little closer to Auggie's age (10).  There were definitely things he just didn't \\"get.\\"  There was an emotional chord that would have been struck more intensely if he'd been a little older and I think some of the \\"mean\\" behaviors of the older kids were something that wasn't something he couldn't relate to.<br /><br />But... We've read together every night since as long as he can remember and this book set a hook in him like none before.  I wonder if I'll look back on this one day and think, \\"he fell in love with books when we read Wonder.\\"<br /><br />I thought switching the perspective of the story teller from one character to another was especially effective in two ways:  1) it changed the flow of the story telling which had the effect of shaking things up and 2) (at least for me, maybe not my 6 year old) had the effect of making the emotional connection with all the character much richer.  The times when I really knew my 6 year old was into this were the chapters where the first-person changed and a paragraph in, he would would stop me with, \\"wait, wait... who's telling the story now.\\"<br /><br />Beautiful, beautiful book!

0307887448|4.0|The eighties have become a nostalgic laden, cheese-induced stereotype that seems to be overused and overrun in every flashback radio weekend and throwback television and movie portrayal. It is all way over-the-top neon colors, headbands, leg warmers and a heavy rotation of one hit wonder hits such as Come On Eileen and I'll Melt With You. No one seems to acknowledge that most of us never dressed that way and that though those songs were popular; there were volumes and album stacks of other music that was played and enjoyed. There is a reason that the term alternative became a music genre, just as there is a reason John Hughes movies still possess relevancy - there were memorable and meaningful things in the eighties - scads of it.<br /><br />One of the elements that Ready Player One gets so right - I mean, completely right - is the eighties. From the film choices, to the music, to video and in-person games, to books and television, it is spot on.  The book itself is filled to the brim with pop culture references. Not since reading Rob Sheffield's books have I felt so personally drawn back to my adolescence, and so connected to the time and place of what it was really like (at least for me).<br /><br />The other thing that I truly believe Cline gets so right is the draw the internet holds to society and sociology, the enormous impact social media, online role playing games, and the shrinking of the world with a click of the keyboard has had on our life now - and in the case of Ready Player One, what it could do to the not so distant future.<br /><br />Wade is a young, desolate orphan who lives in both poverty and family neglect. The world he resides in is post-apocalyptic (or perhaps post-global warning/post-financial crash/financial ruin), and the majority of society are leaving in poverty. A socially inhibited, possibly Asperger/autistic, technological genius, James Halliday, with the help and partnership of his best (only) friend have created a literal oasis called the Oasis, which is a computer generated universe - scratch that, universes - that work like a next generation World of Warcraft.<br /><br /> The Oasis is available to everyone, costing only pocket change to join up, and once a user name and avatar are created one can live their entire existence online - including school, career, relationships, competitions and even sex. A user is fit with a haptic suit and gloves which physically make one feel like they are not playing in a game setting, but living within it.<br /><br />The appeal to this is hard to deny.<br /><br />When the creator of the Oasis falls ill he decides to create an intricate, near impossible mysterious puzzle of a game, a coveted egg to be found at the very end. The winner of said game will inherit all of his fortune, and control of the Oasis. Here is where the story begins.<br /><br />Oasis, being available to nearly anybody, means that for a while nearly everyone was trying to solve the game and find Halliday's egg. Time went by, though, and this was not an amateur treasure hunt, so many but the truly persistent (i.e. obsessed) continued this quest - the persistent and the big corporation. As big business is wont to do, the biggest corporation in the world wants its hands on the egg, and in turn Oasis, so that they can turn it into a profitable, only for those who can afford it space. And the persistent, or gunters, as they are called - well, they want it to prove they can solve it, and in the case of Wade, in order to escape his nowhere life.<br /><br />Wade, or Parzival as his avatar is called, has a best friend who he has never met in \\"real life\\", Aech (pronounced as the letter H). He also has one hell of a huge crush on a smart, sarcastic, pop culture maven of a girl hiding behind her avatar, deemed Art3mis. Though Wade was easy to care about, and root for, I have to say it was Art3mis and Aech that I really loved.<br />The adventure is fast-paced, addicting and impossible to stop reading. Attimes I felt my heart racing along with the three gunters, wondering how they would survive. Other times I cringed and grew irritated with their choices, often catching myself talking to the pages of the book, as if the characters would hear me and take heed.  And, in the end (which I will not spoil), I was touched by a reminder that I try to hold true, about life and love, choices and risk, and persistence.<br />This book is categorized as young adult, a genre, or category, an admitted favorite of mine. That said, I hope the category does not scare off older readers, as I do believe that the reader who grew up in the eighties may enjoy it just that much more than a younger aged reader. Especially moments, like one of my favorites, when a quest in the game is having to act out an entire film, word and action for word and action - the film being 1983's WarGames.<br /><br />Rumor has it Ready Player One is soon to hit the movie screen, which I am both excited and apprehensive about. I hope they can capture the pacing, the imagery and the overall feeling of being digitally and emotionally immersed in a created reality without making it a movie full of badly animated avatars. I hope the humanity is kept intact, as it is in this awesome book.times I felt my heart racing along with the three gunters, wondering how they would survive.

0307887448|4.0|Ready Player One is a romping fun exploration of all things geeky. It is largely well-written, and easy to rip through in a day. Its only shortcomings are that it is somewhat shallow -- there is not as much inventive world creation as in Snow Crash, for example, but the plot progression is better. It is also predictable -- it's the kind of book you read to see how it unfolds, not to see what happens, you can guess that from the back of the book. It leans heavily on the video-game/movie side of geek-hood, with fewer references to scifi/fantasy books, music, and other geeky pursuits. This book is ideal for geeks who fondly remember the 80s, and who want a fun and easy read. It will not satisfy those who are looking for fine literature, plot-twists, or in-depth world creation.

B00881VLCE|2.0|I really liked this until all the puzzle packs that I purchased were deleted in the last update.  Other than that,  there were only a few things that would improve this app.  It would be nice if the background color could be changed according to which puzzle you are working on.  Currently it is dark blue &amp; sometimes it's hard to see puzzle shapes if puzzle is also dark.  The other problem is when you try to move puzzle around to work on certain parts,  it goes spastic.  I would have rated this higher if my puzzle packs weren't deleted.
0374275637|5.0|I'm not going to add something new to what all reviewers has already said about Thinking Fast and Slow. It has more than two hundred reviews and it keeps there, almost scraping the five stars. It deserves them and in my opinion this is due to three things: 1) there's a life of research behind the fundamentals and the conclusions, 2) the author is also clear to explain even that which is hard to explain (and believe), and 3) it makes sense with all that we see both around and inside us..<br /><br />There is something weird about how we make decisions and this book gives you much more than a mere explanation. It's more than light in a dark room. It proposes a mental architecture and a mechanism that makes it work. This is not a lamp in a dark room neither is magic. Here we have research, lots of tests and papers and discussions over a long period of years in many countries and times. Maybe you have never heard about system 1 and system 2 but, believe me, you will never forget them. They are like theatrical characters but very real ones at the same time. They are not the demon and the angel, the good and the bad cop inside our minds in a Freudanian vein. In fact they are the alarm panel and the long term planning department.<br /><br />And it makes sense.<br /><br />Daniel Kahneman proposes several and very simple test to illustrate all this. You can follow them and realize that those characters are inside you as they are inside me. Pink Floyd sang in a song: \\"There's someone in my head but it's not me.\\" Yes, here there's someone (in fact, more than one). But relax, that someone is you. And it's ok.<br /><br />Enjoy the book. During the reading and after finishing it, you'll say with me \\"whoa!\\" as in a football game.

076115678X|4.0|I really love this book.  The only part I didn't like was the Curl Confession on page  117.  Did she really have to mention the lover?  Who cares?  I sent this book to my young niece because the testimonials in this book make you feel happy to have curly hair; and teach you to take care of it.  I would have loved a book like this when I was young.  My sister-in-law is going to put a sticker over page 117.

B000SEIK2S|4.0|I read this book during the summer at the beach and couldnt put it down. It is very interesting if you like science fiction. The theme of the book is very plausable. I high suggest this for a pleasent getaway read.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|At 31, I won't say I have read all the books in this genre but I can certify I did read all the best in the genre and unfortunately some of the worst.<br /><br />\\"Blood song\\" is certainly not perfect, but even with some typos and maybe a structure that feels rushed at times, the main plot is breathtaking. The way the author is writing is reminiscent of some the best authors and certainly doesn't feel like the vas majority of self published books so far. In some chapters, the way the words were minted left me feeling the same way as when I was reading Robert Jordan or Steven Erickson for the first time. Everything that needed to be said was said in words that felt real and not contrived and more so was left unsaid, for he reader to ponder. I love hat ind of very subtil plot where more is being left unsaid and for us to work out.<br /><br />Anyway. As I said a few lines earlier, there is some faults too. Like typos and structures but they feel minor. In my view, the biggest flaw in the story was the love story. It was finely wrought but you didn't feel the passion. Maybe that was the main intention of the author, to have the main character have a 'normal' relationship (well... as normal as the circonstances allows him at the time) but for a warrior monk who says repeatedly he likes the Order he joined and would not betray his vow. It was a rather quick round about. I felt he would need more passion for him to decide to so radically change his views.<br /><br />Anyway, it certainly won't stop me buying the next volume. So, keep up the good work and publish it quickly... please ?
B000FBFN1U|3.0|The work is perhaps too detailed. two to three pages for a dream is a bit much and detracts from the story line. It seems that the author is being paid by the word.

B004EPYZSU|5.0|If you think of this movie like \\"Men In Black\\" in the old West with a bit more seriousness thrown in, you probably won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I was looking for a mindless but fun movie to watch in order to wind down after a long trip and Cowboys & Aliens accomplished that beyond my expectations. If you're looking for a Star Wars type of epic movie this isn't it. It's an off-the-wall movie mixing the typical Wild West plot of the rich town bully who's always battling the out-manned sheriff with the typical Sci-Fi plot of technologically impaired earthlings battling technologically superior (and ugly) aliens. There are some interesting little subplots like Harrison Ford's character, a battle hardened former Colonel and rich cattleman dealing with a disappointing son; and Noah Ringer's character, a young boy struggling with a tentative but growing bravery. Along with the more serious subplots is a clever type of humor that makes you laugh and melds the serious with the silly. Good writing, good acting, and good special effects are what make it all work. If you want to be entertained, like Sci-Fi, and are looking for something with humor, you'll like this movie.

0307743659|5.0|Shining refers to the act of communicating from mind to mind without spoken word. It can be actual sentences that are relayed or simply strong feelings. In one of Stephen King's finest novels, Danny \\"Doc\\" Torrance was blessed with a gift that he uses with such force, he envisions snapshots of the future in his head.<br /><br />Following Jack Torrance's termination from a teaching position at a prep school, he takes a job as caretaker for a hotel deep in the Rockies over the winter. This is the perfect role for the would-be playwright--plenty of time to write at night while the family can enjoy the historic Overlook Hotel.<br /><br />The buried evil of the Overlook comes on gradually. [[ASIN:0307743659 The Shining]]'s genius is that most anything usual that happens has a rational explanation. The primary characters don't have to believe in the supernatural. King has a gift of weaving the inexplicable into his novels in such a way that even the most critical readers are able to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />The highlight of the novel is Dick Hallorann, a black chef that also has the shining gift/curse. He teaches Danny about the gift just as he instructs the Torrances about the old hotel's nooks and crannies. Years later, Hallorann makes an appearance in [[ASIN:0451169514 It]].<br /><br />A classic in both film and literature, [[ASIN:0307743659 The Shining]] can be devoured in a couple days by the devoted reader. 5/5 stars.

B0006N2EZ0|4.0|\\"The Bodyguard\\" starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston was my bargain-rack movie for last night. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. I chose it because I've enjoyed Kevin Costner (Dances With Wolves) and I've liked Whitney Houston's music, although I had no idea she was a movie actress as well. Go figure. Well, I didn't particularly enjoy the movie. The acting seemed weak as well as the plot and I just never could get into the story to any depth. As such, it became a ho-hum late night movie and will easily be forgotten a few nights later. I enjoyed Houston's singing, and it was especially poignant in the light of all the news of her recent death.<br /><br />In the movie, Kostner played a body guard employed to protect Houston from a deranged stalker. Kostner had previous experience as a Secret Service Agent during the time of the Ronald Reagan assassination attempt. and he tightened security around her immensely, even  though she was constantly protesting. However, protecting a popular super-star when she is up for an Academy Award and appears in large crowds of fans is an almost super-human task. Well, he managed and the story had to do with how he managed. It's rather interesting in places. Oh yes, and of course, Kostner managed to fall in love with Houston along the way, which provided a little side story.  The movie is well put together. All in all, I'd say it's a weak movie, but not a bad movie. It's a bit of a yawner and I was expecting more..<br /><br />Gary Peterson
1427214948|5.0|I listened to this unabridged audio book on my commute back and forth to work and home. I had one problem: by the time I reached my destination each time, I was so sorry I didn't have more time to listen. This is truly an edge of your seat story and an excellent sequel to the first Cliftgon Chronicles book.<br /><br />A narrator can make or break an audio book experience. Sins of the Father utilized two narrators - a male for the male dominated sections and a female for the female dominated sections. Just like the first book in the series, this one is broken up in to spans of years of one person's point of view. So using two narrators really worked well here.<br /><br />Sins of the Father is the second book in the Clifton Chronicles series. Just like the first book, it ended with a cliff hanger. Now I can't wait to read (or listen to) book three!
B005I6EVUG|3.0|I did like it a lot but it was a tight fit on the straps. It was a beautiful case and it was a nice cover. But it doesn't offer that much protection.

B006BGZJJ4|1.0|Don't believe Amazon when they say it ships in 5-6 days.  Its been 10 days and now they say it will be another 5.<br /><br />This is not a cord that a User is likely to already have. As such it should come with the kindle.<br /><br />Exceptionally poor customer service.<br /><br />Update: Well, 14 days and counting. I talked to someone in customer service, and at least they didn't lie to me this time. The rep admitted they had no idea when the product would be available again.<br /><br />Oh - and apparently they do have them, just not for my geographical area (?????)<br /><br />Update Aug 29.  I have given up.<br /><br />I selected the kindle because I can borrow kindle books from my library.  However, the books must be transferred to a \\"USB device\\".  This means I must connect my kindle to my pc with this cord.  Ergo, if the cord is unavailable I cannot borrow kindle books from my library.<br /><br />I feel cheated, but amazon has worn me down.

B002AF4Y9G|3.0|My bargain-rack movie for last night was \\"Natural Born Killers,\\" an Oliver Stone film starring Woodie Harrelson and Juliette Lewis. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. The acting was quite good, the filming had all sorts of \\"artsie\\" tricks and the production was first rate. My version was labeled \\"original uncut version.\\"<br /><br />This was one of the very few films I couldn't finish. I just didn't care for it at all. The film deeply offended me. The violence and gore were just overwhelming and seemingly pointless. Perhaps there was some deep meaning there that I just didn't get. Violent films and foul language seldom bother me, although I think a lot of it is excessive and way beyond that needed to make some point. About a third of the way through this movie, I felt like shutting it down, but I continued to watch. That feeling recurred several more times. After about half of the movie had gone by, I just couldn't take it anymore and turned it off. I wasn't angry or disgusted. I just wasn't interested. It was the first movie I haven't completed viewing in the nine years I've been reviewing movies for Amazon. If you wanted my opinion, that's it.<br /><br />Well, such is life. Don't take my word for it. A lot of movie critics liked it. Read some of the other reviews. The most abundant type of review are the five-star reviews. I'd have to give it some credit for it's high production values and excellent acting, of course, but as a form of entertainment, I could only see three stars. It's your dime, but don't say you weren't warned.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B007MJSSCY|5.0|I'll admit that being a huge Maggie Smith fan is what made me watch this movie, and she did not disappoint.  This is a great little family film that you can watch with children of any age.  Set at the end of  WWI, it is basically the story of a family dealing with the feared loss of a loved one, but it isn't focused on that aspect.  It is also about the bonding between a grandmother and her estranged grandson through the family history.  There are ghosts and a mystery to keep the younger ones entertained; as well as the not so young ones.  In my opinion, it is a sweet movie that is excellent family entertainment.  While many movies claim to be \\"family entertainment\\", this one has no offensive language, blood, or even a hint of what I call the nudge and wink hidden inuendo of so many movies today.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Finally,  a good book! I read the Night Circus in a couple days! It was hard to put down.  I loved all the characters and the intertwining<br />of them all.

B000001EEN|1.0|When they released this album in 1973 it was panned for being technically not very good, and it isn't good technically or otherwise. There's really not much to say: good to see Clapton return from heroin addiction, though his then girlfriend Alice appears to have been less lucky, but really he was lackluster that night (I was sitting second row). Of historical interest only to Clapton buffs.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|It was an entertaining read but I found the writing and the story a bit too simple and one dimensional.

B007SGM084|1.0|While I was intrigued at the beginning of the first novel, however the second half of it, and the other two books SUCK.  I guess the plus side to these books is they're getting those who normally don't read to finally do so, but for those of us who read on a regular basis and enjoy a good plot with intelligent writing: DON'T READ THIS CRAP.  Moreover, I don't enjoy the idea of telling young girls that the most important thing in life is to have a boyfriend, especially a boyfriend who controls and beats you.

B0058YPGL6|4.0|I caught a few of these episodes on TiVo and enjoyed them - there's a simple quality to the story and some flavor of the old movie from the 80s.  The major differences are that it's a lot darker, more aggressive and full of sexy people.  The story in \\"enhanced\\" by a lot of shirtless scenes of the main male characters, who are, of course, hot.  As I enjoyed it on TV but didn't get to see the whole series from start to finish, I decided to get this on Amazon, and am glad I did.<br /><br />If you liked the old movie, like werewolves and sexy actors, you'll like this series too.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|Out of all the indie publishers - I have chosen John Locke as my \\"model\\". I write a completely different genre from him, BUT, John has the right mindset for this new booming business in the world of ebooks. This book should be read by every author, whether self or traditionally published, as it makes you think like an entrepreneur - and sell like a business pro. Thanks for the tips and system John!
0345803507|5.0|This trilogy of books were the best books, I have ever read. I wish it was another book to tell what happen after they were married for five years or so.  It should have another trilogy to this set and continue on with their lives, but in another sense it would probably mess up the first three books.  I still think the author did an wonderful job on these books and whoever did not approve of the series need to check their own lives.  I thought it was really a wake up to many marriages and I know it helped mine and I'm not to proud to say it.  People can hide behind the fact that they read this book, but I'm not scared to admit it, excellent book.[[ASIN:0345803507 Fifty Shades Freed: Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I hate when \\"critics\\" bash movies before they come out just because they don't like the genre or their own thoughts on the story.  I was excited to see this film, and greatly enjoyed the concept and how it turned out.  The acting was very good, the cinematography was great, and the effects were fun.  I would recommend this film to sci fi buffs for sure!
B008GFI4KY|5.0|This new album is by no means any better than what this rock quartet has given us so far and there is no way 'Hot Cakes' is better than 'Permission To Land'. Still, I am so happy that The Darkness is back because this band is just plain awesome. 'Hot Cakes' is just 11 tracks of loud blast worthy songs in a nifty little package. They pay tribute to the rock Gods and in this album you will hear some new elements like sounds that you have heard in songs by Journey , Queen, Ted Nugent and even Judas Preist.<br /><br />If you like this band then you will have nothing bad to say. You will just be happy that they are back making awesome music and hopefully there will be more albums in the near future. This album is getting 5 stars just because their music is awesome plain and simple.

0374532281|5.0|This book really surprised me. The first few chapters left me thinking that it would just be a short, quirky read, nothing that would touch me as much as it did. Rarely do the books I read have a happy ending, because, let's be honest, most 'happy endings' are contrived at best. However, the honest and real ending of this book is truly happy, although maybe not ideal. Matthew Quick's writing has a great flow to it, and through the way the book is written, you really feel as though you truly know the protagonist, Pat, as if you've known him all your life.<br /><br />This is one of those books that is hard to put down, I feel like I'm not ready to let go of Pat and his family.
0439023521|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I saw the movie first and, as usual, the book was much better.  I enjoyed getting to see into the mind of Katniss and learning why she did some of the things she did.  A great book!

Adele is fantastic it does not matter what she sings and I am very happy with my choice. Well done amazon for your great variety of music and reasonable prices.

0553801473|5.0|So you feel like the story has failed to advance?  Well I may be young and ignorant of the ways of reviews but what do you want?  Winter is coming and there is a lot of story going on!  Turns out that King's landing and the Iron Throne isn't the center of the universe after all.<br /><br />We started book 1 believing this was the story of the Starks and the north, nearly entirely a feint.  We moved along believing this is the story of Westero's only to find the rest of the world is far more interesting.  It turns out old Nan's stories are true and there are a lifetimes of novels ready to be written about them.  I'd love to see what there is even further east!<br /><br />The best part about a book is that it doesn't have to be all tied up by act 3 to neatly end on time in 2 hours.

030758836X|5.0|\\"Gone Girl,\\" by Gillian Flynn (Crown 2012), is simply the best book I've read this year. Flynn is a relatively new author, having published only three novels so far. Her first, \\"Sharp Objects\\" came out in 2007, and \\"Dark Places\\" came out three years later. \\"Gone Girl\\" was published in June of this year, and has risen meteorically as an Amazon bestseller. What makes this novel so worth reading is what makes all great novels worth reading: an engaging story told with superb writing.<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" is a story about marriage in the extreme, and like so many far-out tales of fictional relationships, it serves to illuminate the constituents of real marriage in real life: what is expected, what is owed, and what will be taken if not given. \\"Gone Girl\\" is Hemingway writing \\"War of the Roses.\\" It's a funny, intriguing, and revealing story about those aspects of a dysfunctional marriage that remind us the worst damages often come from the hands of those we trust the most. Gillian Flynn holds nothing back.<br /><br />There are two main characters, Nick and Amy. Amy, the famous inspiration behind the Amazing Amy series of children's books co-authored by her parents, goes missing and is presumed dead. An investigation is launched by the police and the FBI (and the reader, of course) to find the kidnapper/killer. Naturally, the husband is always suspect number one. What ensues is a game of cat and mouse that will have you saying OMG! with each new chapter and each new twist. I wish I could go on, but I can't describe the story any further without spoiling it for you. So, I will leave it to you to read the book for the rest of it. Nevertheless, the second half of this book's greatness is the writing.<br /><br />When it comes to the writing, Flynn is a master at using the English language to convey her clever insights. This is the hallmark of an expert writer, and Flynn is the definitive expert. Her sense of pacing, tension, suspense, transitions, and diction are on par with some of the greatest writers I've ever read. I honestly believe we'll see a lifelong career from this author as she goes on to write books that become top movies and one day earn her a Pulitzer Prize. In fact when I chose to review \\"Gone Girl,\\" I chose it over the 2011 Pulitzer Prize winning author, Jennifer Eagan, simply because the writing of Gillian Flynn was more captivating than what I found in \\"A Visit From the Goon Squad.\\"<br /><br />I highly encourage anyone looking for a great mystery thriller to grab a copy of \\"Gone Girl.\\" I can easily stake my reputation on the assertion that you'll not be disappointed with the work of this American author. Now is the time to start following her. Gillian Flynn is one of the best.<br /><br />Way to go, girl!<br /><br />--Edward Gordon<br />The Novel Reporth some of the greatest writers I've ever read.

B005LAIH4A|4.0|I am not a big fan of Dr. Seuss stories--Jim Carrey's GRINCH was tolerable...Mike Myers' CAT IN THE HAT was abyssmal.<br />THE LORAX is pretty enjoyable.  The contrasting color schemes are visually imressive and the voice characterizations, especially Danny DeVito and Ed Helms, are quite good.  The shamefully ubiquitous Betty White is just another Betty White shtick.<br />Most of the music is forgettable, but John Powell's instrumental score fits nicely.<br />The film's heavy ecological message is tempered by comic moments, especially by the forest animals.  The movie is the spawn of DESPICABLE ME creators but it's nowhere as much fun as the Minion-populated classic.<br />Older kids and adults should find THE LORAX palatable entertainment.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There are so many review for Wool I am not going to be able to add much. I think this book would've been better if I had read it a little faster. The storyline was great and the writing was excellent. The book is actually broken down into several individual books, the first I really liked and left a cliffhanger at the end that prompted me to buy the collection and I have to say I was a bit disappointed reading the 2nd book which is probably why my reading slowed down, I was so bored with the 2nd book but then the 3rd book started and I was sucked back in.<br /><br />This about life in an underground silo. If you are sent to 'clean', you are being put to death. You can't even talk about the outside. Those in charge are ruthless. I'm trying to word this without including any spoilers but I can't. It is definitely worth the time to read!
B003IKMR0U|4.0|its good for a slow day. I bought it so that my little brother had something to do beside watch tv and play smash bros all day. I just wish it had a little more depth. Still, a great product for its price, i think i might pick up the expansions later.
B008E374PO|3.0|I would not call this album bad. It was a very enjoyable listen, but it lacked the things that I loved about Owl City and the things that made Owl City stand apart. There are two areas where I noticed major differences.<br /><br />One, the lyrics. Previous Owl City albums had quirky poetic words that left the listener in a state of whimsy and wonder. In this album, everything is very simple and plainly stated. Adam is simply telling you things rather than painting a picture. And, the subject matter is less inspired. In previous albums, Owl City had a unique voice and had valuable ideas to contribute. In this album, almost every song is the same \\"believe in yourself and you can accomplish anything\\" that everyone in my \\"I'm so special\\" generation is singing about.<br /><br />Two, the music. In \\"Ocean Eyes\\" and \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\", Owl City created beautiful masterpieces of synthetic symphony. He utilized several sounds and layered them in a complex and compelling way. When recording my own music, I had always held Owl City as the pinnacle of great mixing and great orchestration. With this new album, the music is very basic and repetitive. None of the songs take you on the kind of journey that \\"Cave In\\" or \\"Umbrella Beach\\" did.<br /><br />I will say that I still love Owl City and I did enjoy this album, but this feels more like a step back than a step forward. I hope that in the future we hear more songs like the ones on \\"Ocean Eyes\\" and \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\".

B0087DFIOU|4.0|If you like action films, really don't want to think too hard and actually care for some of the characters, this film of Mel Gibson's is a lot better than the critics made it out to be.<br />No, there is no deep message.  No it doesn't tug on the heartstrings (unless you're really gullible).  Yes, you can answer the phone and take a short phone call and really kind of figure out where you were/are.  So, not a deep film, but a fun film with a very interesting concept of where it takes place.<br />Just a fun film to watch on an evening when you really don't have anything else to do, had a tough day at work and just want some mindless entertainment with lots of action.<br /><br />Highly underrated film.

1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson had a tough task here - compiling the story of a near-mythic individual, one whose life was thought to be known (every move and utterance parsed and scrutinized) and yet still remained unknown (his family life remained deeply private), and releasing it in the days when that mythologizing was stoked to a fever pitch.  Despite that pressure, Isaacson has produced an outstanding piece of work.  It's as readable as a novel.  In many ways, its subject's life does have the setbacks and triumphs of a piece of fiction.  The protagonist is as complex as any character that the best writer could conjure up.<br /><br />I'm struck by the balance of the book.  It clocks in at 570 pages and could easily go much, much longer.  Entire libraries have been written about some of the subjects covered here: the birth of Apple; Sculley and Jobs; Gates and Jobs; Jobs at NeXT; the return of the King; the birth of the iPod and so on.  Thinking about one small story from the book: the tale of Apple shifting from Motorola chipsets to Intel.  I thought, wow, I could read a book about that subject alone.  And there's surely a book's worth of material there.  Yet, Isaacson dives in just deep enough on each subject to give you the essence of the man.  He has to do that.  Otherwise, he winds up with 1,500 pages.  I'd read that as would some others, but most of the public will barely tolerate a 570-page work.<br /><br />Second and more importantly in terms of balance, even though Jobs solicited Isaacson directly, he encouraged the author not to hold back in terms of presenting the bad along with the good.  [Jobs' wife tells Isaacson in the book's prologue that her husband had a \\"messy\\" life in a lot of areas.]  In a world filled with anti-Jobs screeds and pro-Jobs encomiums, Isaacson nails the genius/a--hole dichotomy at the center of this guy's life.  Besides tales of brilliance, focus and relentlessness, Jobs' inherent meanness is a constant theme of the book.  As the epilogue states, \\"[e]ven his family members wondered whether he simply lacked the filter that restrains people from venting their wounding thoughts or willfully bypassed it.\\"  For a guy that lumped all people into \\"hero or sh-thead\\" categories, Isaacson's work at detailing Jobs own dichotomous nature without appearing to take a side is a feat of dexterity and integrity.es, \\"[e]ven his family members wondered whether he simply lacked the filter that restrains people from venting their wounding thoughts or willfully bypassed it.\\"  For a guy that lumped all people into \\"hero or sh-thead\\" categories, Isaacson's work at detailing Jobs own dichotomous nature without appearing to take a side is a feat of dexterity and integrity.
0061692042|4.0|I loved the first part of this book and would easily rate it a five. I looked forward to reading it at night. It does unravel at a slow pace, but I enjoyed it and thought the characters were very well-developed (the parents, Dell and his sister). The chapters on his home life, the bank robbery, and his relationship with his parents & sister were my favorites. The writing was beautiful, which matters to me, but the story started to weaken in the second half. Dell got older and his voice less clear, and none of the new characters seemed important to him, or to the story, and so it became less of a page-turner. I did miss Bev and Neeva Parsons, I thought they were great characters!
B000AJIF4E|3.0|I bought these for recording music and practicing on my bass (via plugging them into my amp).  All the reviews I read were said they were great and even a friend at a music store said they were the best on the market.<br /><br />Got them today and the first test was listening to some music on my stereo.  They sounded very good and may have been worth the price right there.  Recording was very good with them, all the instruments came out sounding clear.  The deal breaker was when I plugged them into my amp; they produced a horrible feedback that was simply too much to get past.  When I plugged in my old headphone kit (a 5$ pair of Panasonics with a 2$ jack adapter) I noticed that there was NO FEED BACK AT ALL.  Sure the tones did not come out as rich as on the Sony's but that didn't matter when the rich tone was covered up by a great deal of feedback and buzzing.<br /><br />At that point, I immediately decided to send the back for a refund.  They are great headphones but, for 99$, I don't want my 5$ headphones beating them in any areas.  Also, the design seemed a little cheap on them; the wires that connect the ear pieces together are left very much exposed and are just begging to be pulled out.  Again, I have a 30$ pair of Koss that sound like crap but the design is much more stable then these.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a fast read with lots of twists and turns that kept it intriguing.  I really didn't want it to end!
0345803485|3.0|I bought the book based on all the buzz and about halfway through the book I was wondering what all the fuss was about. I found the writing to be weak and amateur. I could see how someone would be titillated and I can't deny that there were times when I was blushing when reading this during my commute. But it's essentially a romance novel and a not particularly well written one at that. I like romance novels, but this was not one of the better ones. Overall, I'd give this something like a 3.5 stars - pretty entertaining and sexy but not worth all the hype
B00536OCZA|1.0|First thing Amazon should allow for reviews to be separated between vinyl and CD. This used to be the case but they changed it.  If these reviews were just for the vinyl then they more than likely would be 2 or less.  This review is for the vinyl.<br /><br />Let me first say that I love this album.  Still remember the first time I listened to it.  Neighbor picked it up when it first came out and it blew me away.  I was 14 at the time.<br /><br />I have several copies of this album and I am not going to get into which one sounds best.  Don't get me wrong I love the mastering on this one.<br /><br />The reason for the 1 stars is that the pressing is junk.  No other way to put it.  Just check out the reviews for the vinyl album on the web.  I waited quite a while to purchase this album hoping that I would get a second pressing that would be better than the reviews that I have read.  No luck first one I returned and the second one was worse than the first.  The sleeve is paper and it had papers scrapes and the same tics on the second side as the first one did a little more than half way through.  Holding it up to the light I was surprised at how bad it looked for a 29 dollar new album.<br /><br />I would have returned this one also but I have to pay return shipping which in the end could raise the price of this album way beyond the original purchase price.  If I purchased local I would keep returning them until I got an acceptable one.  It's almost like so many of them were returned that they could not take the finical hit and they are repackaging them and selling the returns.<br /><br />I have 40 year old vinyl that looked better than this album did new.<br /><br />On another note The Wall and Wish You Were Here were great.  DSOTM is a great album just can't listen to it if it's that noisy.<br /><br />This is being played on a VPI Scoutmaster Signature with a Benz Micro Ruby cart.<br /><br />Good Luck

The only thing he knows is that he's hurting, his eye is practically buttoned up and his side and back hurt with each excruciating step. When he finds himself back in the hospital it all comes back to him. He's Secret Service Agent, Ethan Burke, and he's searching for some missing colleagues. The town itself seems a little off and when events start to unravel he realizes he needs to escape from the little town of Wayward Pines and fast.<br /><br />From the minute we meet Ethan he's go go go. I don't think he caught a break the entire time. Very difficult to piece together until the author wants you to know what's happening. I love how it all came together and how everything was answered in the end.<br /><br />All in all I really enjoyed this one and I love how it kept going all the way to the end. Makes me want to see Twin Peaks.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|love the games. great for younger kids as well as older. too many ads though, constantly have ads popping up while playing

B00881VLCE|3.0|I was really enjoying this app but when I went to do puzzles today all my previous puzzle packs were gone. some I had even paid for and now I don't see them. I went back and redownloaded some but when I went to do them they weren't there.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Note: I got this as the free app of the day on my Kindle Fire.  I would happily pay a buck for it.<br /><br />Ichi is a variation on the 'move through all the boxes' kind of game. It has a simple yet elegant look to it. The game play is straightforward, but still challenging.<br /><br />Think of it as a kind of directed pinball, where you want to hit each of a set of targets. In each level, the ball is in an odd shaped room, moving in straight lines, rebounding off (some) walls and obstacles. Your goal is to pass the ball through every target on the level without letting the ball leave. To do this, you tap the screen to rotate all the controllable bumpers on the screen by 90 degrees at a time, which in turn changes the direction the ball bounces off of them. Your goal is to hit all the targets with the minimum number of taps.<br /><br />The game has a nice, clean look to it, almost like a blueprint. It works great on my fire, and the controls are responsive. The level design ramps up  nicely, from trivial to diabolically difficult. For each level you get a letter grade (based on the number of taps you used) which tells you when you've done great, or when there's a better way to solve the level. I really enjoyed iterating towards an 'A' for each level.<br /><br />The game is easy to pick up and play for a minute or two, or you can spend a half hour working through a bunch of levels. This makes it perfect for eating up a few minutes here and there.<br /><br />Great game, well worth getting!
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This is a great game for smaller formats and for quick games on the go - a sort of a super simplified Civilization meets Advance Wars. It's simple to get into and play, but can be challenging, at times, on harder difficulty settings.<br /><br />UniWar HD is a well thought out and exceptionally well made game for what it's trying to do. In fact, I think the makers could even charge for more races, options, and map packs, There's enough here to justify it, especially since there is an online PVP option.<br /><br />Now we need Advance Wars to come to android and Kindle. Until then, this will do.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Its a pretty good ZOMBiE ADDiCTiVE GAME.. But with some problems its a bit LAGGY only sometimes it kind of freezes during gameplay In my kindle fire .. so for that I took the last star.. But I actually really enjoy this game! :)<br />-CUTEKiD/7
B004QL7K6G|1.0|Ok so I love Jennifer Aniston's work.  Almost all of her movies have been enjoyable so I am really surprised that I didn't like this one, at all.  Whom ever wrote the script for this movie knew what potentially could be funny but couldn't execute. American Pie, hilarious and just as ronchy but it was executed well.  This movie just left you staring at the screen going...wow...how much longer is this?  I paid $16- for this???  It's a shame because I was looking for one redeeming quality about this movie, for instance, one liners that are funny...like 'this one time, at band camp':)  I was shocked that there wasn't even that.  Really sad that is movie was so poorly scripted and directed.  Spend your money elsewhere...sorry Jen.  Also received Monty Python's search for the holy grail...now that is timeless comedy.  Will be watching that tonight trying to erase the sorry mess this movie was.

B004U52VPS|4.0|My 3-year-old loves watching Angry birds on the iPad and Fire. I got him this game so he could play it physically. He quickly tired of it, as did I. The set is cute, but I felt it was too difficult for us to play, mostly because of the inconsistent slingshot.<br /><br />Pro:<br />+ Looks really good! Faithful to the game in appearance, and pieces seem sturdy<br />+ Includes everything you need to build nice-looking levels: birds, pigs, plastic beams of different shapes, and enough of all of them<br />+ Slingshot is fun and strong enough to shoot birds a few feet<br />+ Includes lots of different cards that show you how to set up the pieces, and what order you should shoot birds<br />+ Birds have different properties: fly different distance, have different sizes, like the game!<br /><br />Con:<br />- Birds must be carefully oriented in the slingshot, or will fly dramatically different on different shots<br />- Works best with slingshot on a hard surface, as otherwise slingshot varies in elevation / distance it shoots<br />- I would have liked the blocks better if they were solid on all six sides rather than hollow on two long ends.<br /><br />This is worth buying if you like the game and want to fiddle with it. It's good, but not great, hence four stars.
B002ZG997C|2.0|This movie was even WORSE than I was afraid it would be.  Inane, hackneyed, predictable & a waste of time.  Sorry to see Gary Oldman waste his time & talent on this post adolescent, gum chewing mind numbing snoozer.<br /><br />The Hughes brothers could take lessons from the Cohen & Wachowski bros.

B008602KQI|4.0|I'm still trying to figure out why that black guy was in<br />the movie!?  Projection of black power?  Her pimp?  He added<br />nothing to the movie, only detracted from it.  And the little<br />black kid?  This was not a movie about a heroine, but about<br />blacks stealing the show from her.  And how many times<br />does it take, to show an arrow?  You never saw her hitting<br />a target, just shooting.  It was an ok movie and the special<br />effects were great, but the acting need to be honed a little<br />more.  She need some acting schooling.  Lame.
B008AWBQGW|1.0|THIS BAND IS MORE LIKE NASHVILLE COUNTRY THAN A LEGENDARY SOUTHERN ROCK BAND, DONT WASTE YOUR $ LIKE I DID... ANOTHER WEAK EFFORT BY THE HOUSE BAND FROM FOX NEWS
B006LMND8C|5.0|Emma Woodhouse, author Jane Austen tells us in the very first sentence, was handsome, clever, and rich, and blessed with a happy disposition.  In her first page, she suggests that the young Emma has perhaps had her own way in things too often.  In her first chapter, we learn that Emma credits herself with having arranged the fortunate marriage of her governess to a wealthy neighbor, and believes herself more than ready to manage the social affairs of her hometown of Highbury.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is perhaps Jane Austen's most delicious romantic comedy, built around the match-making attempts of Miss Woodhouse, and the mangled relationships and social disasters that ensue.  Although Emma means well, she ignores the advice of her good older friend Mr. Knightley to leave well enough alone, begining with her attempts to raise up the social status of her friend Harriet Smith.  In the end, amid the ruins of her plans, Emma may face some difficult choices, and a fateful but priceless conversation with Mr. Knighley about her future.<br /><br />The comedy ripples through every chapter.  Austen's supporting cast is well-chosen and well-written; this is a fun novel, and much more than a comedy of manners.  Along the way, the reader will be treated to Emma's education in life, a worthwhile journey with an interesting ending.  \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen.
B004QL7K6G|1.0|not much to say about the movie  not happy with the video download from amazon.  I will not ever rent a movie from this format again
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I started this book with really low expectations. As a result, I got it from the library. Based on what I'd read about it, I figured it'd be slow, nothing would happen, and there would be all these random new people that had no relevance. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the novel. Yeah, Martin probably could have cut some of it out, and yeah, I certainly skimmed more than in the last few. But after a little while, I kind of liked seeing the POV of some of these characters. It was interesting to see Cercei's scheming (and paranoid reasoning), and Jaime's continued evolution. Brienne wasn't all that interesting, but she too developed as a character. Overall, this novel was more about character development than the action we're used to. However, I think the new characters served to illustrate what was going on in places we hadn't be in a lot, like Dorne, so it wasn't a complete waste of paper. Martin's problem is that he's set such a high bar that it's hard to meet his readers' expectations. If this was the first book, this series wouldn't be nearly as popular as it is. As the fourth book in a series, it's not so bad. If you've read the first three, you'll want to read this, but don't expect a masterpiece.<br /><br />I rated it a 3 since really it's just about average (especially in light of Martin's other works), but worth a read if you've read the other books in the series.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The series as a whole was great. Book one was my least favorite because there wasn't much to the story, however, it was setting the background for the rest of the books. I only gave it 4 stars because I would give the \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" trilogy 5 stars and the Gray trilogy is definitely not as good, but it is close!
B001B80EM4|5.0|This is such a great movie! I enjoyed the whole thing. I thought it was well written.<br />I actually watched it 3 times in a row the first night I got it! :D
B005HJWWW8|5.0|i came across the e5, i looked at the reviews and some mentioned the e6. so being interested, i decided to order one since my phone has a terrible sound quality with my ihome IB40s (amazing sound quality but poor build quality. i didn't expect much quality out of $15 headphones). anyway, my ib40s drain the hell out of my phone battery and it's whisper quiet for me. so i got my Fiio e6 today and all i've been doing is playing music as high as it can go and playing with the equalizer modes. as soon as i changed the mode to bass boost, i threw my headphones off since the bass was so heavy and really tickled my ears haha. i love this headphone amp so much. i would definitely recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />ONE SMALL DRAWBACK! i really don't like how the audio gets really hissy while it's charging but i can't really count that against it since it's so amazing!<br /><br />it comes with 2 plastic clips, 1 straight end aux cable, 1 90 degree aux cable, and one mini USB cable (not micro USB[pretty much smartphone chargers for people who don't know the difference])
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Utterly superb. The fact these guys have been doing it over 40 years and can still put out an album that shines just as bright as they did in the 70s and 80s is beyond impressive. This is a \\"must have\\" album for any Rush fan, and a good introduction for any new fans. Again, utterly superb. Not a single bad song, and \\"Caravans\\" is my favorite Rush song...ever.

0307744434|4.0|I love this book.  It was a little slow to start, but it gets very intriguing and mysterious with a romantic twist, which is why I wanted to read it.  It's definitely 5-Star literature.  However, I bought the paperback because I wanted to read it right away and it was only $9.00. I usually only buy hardcovers.  The day after I started reading it, the cover started to come away from the binding.  After only a week, the entire cover came off and it just stays on when it's closed.  The glue isn't very tacky.  So the book itself, I have to be careful not to open too wide so it doesn't rip apart at the seem.<br /><br />Otherwise, the literature is awesome and I highly recommend it.  Buy it on Kindle if you can.
B007XIO9TU|3.0|3 1/2 Stars.  I am a Johnny Winter fan -period.  His influences are the real deal, he himself is the real deal and his musical legacy is one for the ages.<br /><br />As a fan who owns Johnny's music on album, cassette and CD as well as the DVDs: \\"Live Through the 70's\\", \\"Live Through the 80's\\" and \\"Live in Times Square\\", I could not pass up this DVD \\"Live in Japan\\" for $10.<br /><br />This is by far an improvement over the Times Square DVD (I feel that DVD was a pure money grab as Johnny was a shell of himself physically and musically during that tour unfortunately).  On this DVD the 16X9 aspect ratio and multiple camera angles work and are well edited. The audio seems fine on the small system I used when watching this show.  His band is good and certainly add to Johnny's crowd pleasing performance.  If I was in the live audience on this night in Japan, I would have left feeling satisfied.  The volume levels, crowd noise, enthusiasm and room echo minimize the effect of some mistakes, flat notes and timing.  On this DVD Johnny is in much better form than in the Times Square performance and it is great to see improvement vs further diminished skills.<br /><br />I give this 3 1/2 stars because his guitar playing is good but not great. Johnny's Icon status gives him the right to perform to fans that will pay to see him (and there is still plenty -myself included- who will) but this DVDs level of performance would not have made Johnny the legend he is today.  If you are OK with that you will be glad you got this DVD, but if you are buying this hoping to see a fabulous Texas blues player at the peak of his skills, you may be less than satisfied.  The songs played are mainly classics that have been covered many times by many musicians ... I would have liked to see him reach for some less known but solid songs that he has in his bag of tricks ... he chose not to it seems.  I could easily give this 5 stars just because I appricate Johnny Winter but I chose to give my honest assessment of this DVD ... 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />With this said, I hope Johnny continues to perform for as long as he wants ... he deserves it.<br /><br />Edit: July 20 2014 ... Johnny's passing gives this era of his career important historic value for a fan like me.  Thank goodness it is apparent that Johnny's passion and skills continued to recover from this performance forward to his passing just days ago.  This DVD's performance documents a new phase in time where Johnny looks to be enjoying playing live (and recording) as much as any time in his career ...yet remaining very humble in interviews.<br /><br />Thank goodness that, shortly before his death, a documentary on his life was filmed that he got to see (Trailer:[...]) as well as a new CD (Step Back) recorded with big-league guest musicians joining in to pay respects. He spoke of both these projects with enthusiasm in his final interviews (go to YouTube).  Of course these will be posthumous releases but at least Johnny was aware they were in the works for release.  He practiced his craft to the end and was privileged to see the genuine respect that his fans and fellow musicians had for him in his last days.<br /><br />RIP Johnny and thank you!.. 3 1/2 stars.

B002LLE3Q8|5.0|If ever there was a pre-digital recorded work that needed the dynamical range afforded by digital recording, this is it.<br />Steven Wilson so clearly grocks Crimson.<br />One of my favorite albums, first heard in 1971.<br />This is a very minor rewrite of my original review, with thanks to a fellow Crimson fan's expert critique.<br /><br />I direct my thoughts at those who don't know it.<br /><br />Ignore this harbinger of \\"Prog\\" at your musical peril. Recall that \\"Prog\\" did not exist in 1969. And we soon after talked of \\"Precision Rock\\"<br />I would posit that this album, for all of its alleged faults, really did pop up out of nothing in some senses, in a World dominated by Beatles, Stones, Vietnam protests and a swathe of folkies.  Hard Rock just getting going, defined by Deep Puple and Sabbath, and some having a go at blending the neo-rock with classical sounds, with variable success.<br /><br />Rarely has anyone deliberately tried to change a world,and succeed as well as this. Pink Floyd were finding their feet, still far from their place in the rock pantheon.<br />Yet, this music was a world away from what Fripp and friends were mostly playing in the weeks and months before...so what kind of epiphany did they have?<br /><br />1969 was a huge year, with many bands trying to break free of a mold, many great musicians trying to redetermine where music could be going. From 18,000km and 43 years away, \\"Woodstock\\" seems to have encapsulated A North American showcase of its brightest, battling the British poular music dominance, at least commercially.<br /><br />So, to continue a quantum cosmological allegory....1969 was the Big Bang, and KC, here, a musical and social condensation around a quantum fluctuation.  Now we can see the musical light having emerged from the prior chaos and opacity.<br /><br />In my view (and I'm rarely wrong), \\"In the court..... \\" defined what would be later regarded as \\"Prog\\"<br />The soundscape is indubitably Jazz-Rock Fusion, the sensibilities very jazzy, and the result is a sublime blend indeed.<br /><br />Sinfield's lyrics are genuinely poetic, at times apocalyptic, at others hopeful and lyrical.<br /><br />The rythmic heart, always a hallmark, (if a sometimes opaque aspect) of KC; here Michael Giles and Greg Lake sparkle and drive the show in the up-tempo songs.<br />Lake's vocals were never as good as on this set...strong, heartfelt with admirable control.<br />The keyboards and wind, courtesy Ian McDonald are as well balanced and appropriate as ever.<br /><br />And Fripp's guitar, tinkling or wailing or noodling away. The guys had no problems with form, in this set. Truly inspired.<br /><br />The opener,\\"21st century Schizoid man\\", screams and batters in its bleakness...raucous, harsh, but sets a tone for this and later works.<br />Then, \\"I talk to the wind\\", a most melodic,lyrical, poetic, gentle work, and a welcome respite.<br />Thence to \\"Epitaph\\"...amongst my favorite 3 KC songs..all there...drama, power, poetry, meaning, honest hard work. Few have been able to better this song in the Rock traditions.<br /><br />\\"Moonchild\\", generally criticized for its wandering into nothingness. I love it, and was disturbed at the truncated version first heard on this collection, though not surprized, as I'd read of this previously.<br />Thankfully, the full version is heard as a bonus track.<br />The last, title track is rather like \\"Epitaph\\", but without quite the impact. I forgive them.<br />The first CD contains the full version of Moonchild, and a fascinating duo version of \\"I talk to the wind\\", then an alternative mix; then the backing track only of \\"Epitaph\\", which is illuminating, but lacks the drama...Lake's singing is clearly pivotal.<br /><br />Fripp explains how they came to produce the album in the helpful notes.<br /><br />The 1st disc is essentially Steven Wilson's 2009 make-over , with the shortened Moonchild. The sound quality is brilliant, and better than I remember my Vinyl to be.<br/>The second disc is the 2004 Original master Edition. I don't think the bonus tracks on disc 2 add any more to our grocking of this seminal work.<br /><br />So, boys and girls...(us old geezers' grandchildren)..give up on \\"The Voice\\",\\"X Factor\\", and most of the tripe that the modern iterations of major recording companies think you must enjoy and buy.<br />Leave your MP3s alone.<br />Embrace your inner \\"Proghead\\"<br />Start where it began.<br />Grock.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This a inexpensive DVD and you get a lot for your money. I was not in any kind of good shape when I first started this DVD. I use it about twice a week as a break from my gym sessions. Jillian is informative about the correct way to do the moves. She seems to say something very motivating at just the right time. She changes up the moves to keep it interesting and it is defiently an effective 25 minutes of your day. You defiently feel muscles you didnt know you had. AND she has modified versions of the moves fot people who are not as advanced. I love it.
B0089IGUP4|5.0|This is the album that pulls it all together for The Gaslight Anthem. I have to admit, my fondness for \\"American Slang\\" has grown in the time since I've owned it, and if I had to re-rate it, I'd bump it to 4 stars. \\"Handwritten\\" finally culminates all the band's influences (Nirvana, Tom Petty, Springsteen) and forges them into a band identity. That alone makes \\"Handwritten\\" the TGA's best to date.<br /><br />That's not all the group is about. There's an energy that producer Brendon O'Brien (Pearl Jam, Springsteen) has managed to harness that previous TGA discs haven't. The eleven songs here unleash a punkish racket at times, but remain lyrically focused while asking a lot of questions. In fact, almost every song starts off with a question, including \\"What's Your Favorite Song?\\" on the title song. But the questioning is sincere, and when they drop the adrenaline for a benediction ballad about a thinning relationship (\\"National Anthem\\"), it's good enough to make you tear up. The Gaslight Anthem are the kind of band that, should you see them in a local pub, would either have you raising your bottle clenched by your pumping fist, or crying in your beer over how damn good they are and how rare a band that rocks like they mean it seems to be these days.<br /><br />The deluxe edition contains three bonus tracks that return the the bands' roots. One is a TGA original, but it's the other two that are telling. First up is Nirvana's \\"Sliver\\" (aka, \\"Grandma take me home\\"), and the Kurt Cobain resemblance is stunning. Then a straightforward version of Tom Petty's \\"You Got Lucky,\\" one of Petty's darker singles. Singer Brian Fallon finds the everyman melodrama that Petty has always known, and milks the song for all he can. That everyman vibe infuses so much of \\"Handwritten\\" that you can't help but love it. Like a lot of the artists mentioned in this review (maybe John Mellencamp or Against Me on \\"New Wave\\"), TGA know that their listeners are probably still in that bar, clutching that bottle, and getting on when a band sings more about them than glitz and glamor. Already a best of for 2012.hat bottle, and getting on when a band sings more about them than glitz and glamor. Already a best of for 2012.

0393327345|5.0|I'm enjoying a quiet week of reading down at the Outer Banks in North Carolina.  Fight club has been far from quiet.  It's now 2012, 16 years since Chuck Palahniuk published Fight Club, his first novel.  The phenomenon of Fight Club has mostly played out...ever since the movie version propelled this work to household status. Fight Club is fiction.  It's anarchy.  It's schizophrenic.  It's dark.  It's gross.  It's freeing.  It's troubled.  It's poetic.  It's haunting.  It's prophetic.  It's eluring.  It's dangerous.  It's completely wrong.  It's completely right.  I can't think of a better way to spend time reading than bending the damp pages of this book in the safe cocoon of a beach house with the surf in the background and a cold beer within reach, wondering if there's a fight club near me...not that I would go.<br /><br />Palahniuk didn't write this book to be anything but pure entertainment...whatever label fans of this book (and movie) have given it over the years is a testament to the effect it has on it's audience.  At it's very core it is a love story as tragic as any love story ever written.  On the surface it's a manifesto for the rebellion of the common man.  It fails as a love story because you are not moved to tears at its conclusion.  It fails as a revolutionary text because the recipe for rebellion it describes is completely inconsistent and a one way ticket to homelessness, prison, disfigurement, and/or death...not sacrifices one would readily make for a cause without understanding the cause.<br /><br />It achieves, however, a psychological pathology that turns Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde on it's head.  All of us share a common attribute with regard to our brains...we all have a left side and a right side.  In theory the level at which we are all schizophrenic is directly related to how closely the two sides of our brain communicate.  In Julian Jayne's monumental, \\"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\\" one could attribute the residual evidence of split personality disorder as a leftover artifact of our brain's evolution...something all of us might posses.  This could mean there's a Tyler Durden hiding in all of us...regardless of whether our personal Tyler Durden looks like Brad Pitt. Inside each of us could be an Oracle, or a madman.  I believe it's this hidden side, the side from which Palahniuk blows us out of the water, that makes his novel, and this work, so important to us fans.  Five stars for Fight Club.e residual evidence of split personality disorder as a leftover artifact of our brain's evolution...something all of us might posses.

B000JMKO3C|3.0|This book explores what people consider \\"normal\\" versus \\"crazy\\".  It also let me realize that once one is living, you dont realize the importance of things you encounter in your day to day life and show appreciation for the simple things.  However, once you realize that you only have a few days to live, you try to live as much as u can within those few days, and do the things that you would never do since you wont live long enough to suffer the consequences or to even care what people would say. (Things such as approach a guy, do things in public you always thought was embarrassing, do things outside of your comfort zone).<br /><br />Also, it touches on the fact that when you are living and doing the same things every day in a mundane routine, you tend to think this life is not for you and is not worth living as it just a rote existence and you just want to end it all.<br /><br />It's an eye opening book, but you have to interpret the full meaning below the surface/words.  If you take it at face value, I don't think you will like it.  This is my 4th book that I have read by Paulo and thus far my 3rd favorite.

8866131385|2.0|I love my Moleskine--but not the 2012-2013 18 month planner. They have redesigned the front calendars. Instead of the typical \\"block\\" calendars they have in the front of the book, they have created a vertical list of each day in the month. There are no boxes in the calendar, and this makes it very hard for me to plan. I will end up printing out my own traditional block calendars and pasting them in the book.<br /><br />Buyer beware--if you want the block calendars and get this planner, you'll need to make your own.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed. Unless they change the format for 2013-2014, I'll be hunting for the \\"perfect\\" planner again. :(

B0055PGUYU|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B008DI4796 Abundance Is For You Too: Experience an Abundant Life in 5 Simple Steps (Applying the God Formula]], I realize the importance and power of habits.  This book addresses why we do what we do and the effect it has on the results of our life.  Why is that is so powerful!  What we spend our time and focus on is precisely what we get in our life.<br /><br />I think The Power of Habit offers very good information, though it was a bit too long for me personally.  I think it could have been summed up quicker.
0525423656|4.0|Crossed is the second installment in Ally Condie's Matched trilogy. It begins a couple months after the conclusion of Matched. Cassia and Ky are both placed in the Outer Provinces by the Society. They are both preoccupied trying to find each other- They will go through any lengths to get to the other. I REALLY wanted to like this book more than I did. I really enjoyed Matched and had high expectations for Crossed. Though I did enjoy Crossed, I feel it isn't as strong as Matched.<br /><br />I had a couple issues with the story. I actually didn't feel anything from the characters here, they let me apathetic. The story alternates back and forth from Cassia's to Ky's perspectives. Considering we are reading from a first person perspective, the characters were fairly numb about the horrible events unfolding around them. Again, it is as if I am being told how the characters felt, instead of experiencing their emotions with them as the story progresses. It's a small distinction, but an important one. It is also a little too teen angsty for me. Lots of pining and longing. (I didn't like the Twilight series for that reason, so take my opinion as you will). I also got tired of the poetry.  Do not go gentle. Got it.<br /><br />I did like Crossed on the whole. I adored Cassia and Ky's deepening relationship. I liked learning more of Ky's back story. And the whole mystery surrounding the Society, the Rising, the Farmers, the Enemy is incredibly interesting. Almost nothing is known or given away about them. There are tons of secrets. This propels my curiosity and I have to finish this trilogy. I think this book is more of a bridge between the first and the third. I think I will enjoy this book more once I read the trilogy in entirety so I can see how it fits into the whole story arc.

1594744769|4.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children has a great premise. Ransom Riggs intertwined creepy vintage photographs into the story- A neat trick that heightens the story.  The photographs themselves are really cool.  They show a lot of \\"trick photography\\" with seemingly levitating children and the like.  In a lot of ways, the photographs are the best part of the book.<br /><br />The beginning of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children starts out strong- eerie and unsettling.  I thought I was settling in to a horror type paranormal book,  but once Jakob starts to uncover the mystery of the orphanage, the book starts to switch gears into an adventure story.  I preferred the start of the book to the end, which ends very abruptly.  I'm assuming this is to leave room for a sequel.  The middle of the book also proved a little problematic for me as well.  There were times I felt like the author leaned a little too much on the photographs to carry the story.  And I feel the characters are not as developed as they could have been.  It is marketed towards young adults, but the writing seemed juvenile.  I think young teenagers would enjoy this book more than older ones.

B008JH5CVS|1.0|While Guy Pierce did a fantastic job in Memento and is a fine actor, his role in this movie leaves a lot to be desired.  Between bad special effects, and a very weak story line, this movie left me so bored, I actually fell asleep.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|I wasn't going to download this FAOTD because it was a war game. But really it's just a strategy game with shooting. Believe the people who say there is a big, very big, learning curve. There are good instructions but if you are not familiar with these games they can be hard to understand. Add to that the white text on black background and it is even more difficult. But there is a tutorial game to start you off and it walks you through till you \\"get it\\". I had to play the first mission three times before I got even that easy level.<br /><br />I was forever on mission two before it dawned on me that \\"Actions Remaining 0\\" meant just for that unit, not the whole play. I couldn't figure out why I only got one move and the enemy kept getting more and more. Duh. Once I got it I went through that mission fairly quickly.<br /><br />A nice feature in this is that you don't have to wait for the enemy to make their moves. You can skip by that by clicking the check mark in the lower left to stop the count down and then the arrow to move on to your turn.<br /><br />I'm not sure but I think I've learned about 2% of this game so far. This game has a lot to offer, but I won't be playing a real person any time soon.<br /><br />No unnecesary permissions, no IAP, no ads not even for the devs other games, no nags to rate. Thanks to the devs for these things. For those who love this type of game $5 would be a real bargain. Works well on Kindle Fire, although it doesn't always register my taps right away.
159514188X|2.0|Ooh boy.  Thirteen Reasons Why is a real hard one for me to review.  I mean, how do you review a book about suicide?  It is such a personal, controversial subject but one that needs to be talked about more.  Especially given the recent influx in teen suicides due to bullying.  Because I've never been in Hannah's position, I don't feel comfortable commenting on her reasons and whether they are \\"good enough\\" reasons to commit suicide.  But bullying does play a big part in Hannah's decision to commit suicide.  She records the tapes with the instructions to pass them on to those who have wronged her. There isn't one particular person to blame, but instead, each person's actions snowballed until Hannah felt alone and unable to continue with life.<br /><br />The book has such great promise and a good message, but it just didn't sit right with me.  Hannah seemed so vindictive and it is hard for me to connect with her.  I don't blame her for being angry, but I never felt her depression.  She also makes an awful decision towards the end that makes me very angry.  And I felt she never accepted the any blame for her actions.  This decision essentially destroys another person's life, but I never really feel that Hannah is truly sorry.  I found it so hypocritical that she sends these tapes and spreads the blame around, but doesn't take responsibility for something that happens that is (arguably) worse than anything that happened to her.<br /><br />So, the book doesn't really work for me.  Again, I think the message is VERY important.  Our actions carry a lot of weight and accepting the stone throwing is just as damaging as being the one casting the stones.  But I couldn't relate or connect with Hannah as a character and I had a really hard time getting past the end.

0307346617|3.0|World War Z is a collection of oral history recollections that take place about 10 years after the end of \\"World War Z\\", an apocalyptic war against the undead.  A plague, originating in China, kills and then reanimates people into zombies.  The plague spreads quickly and threatens to wipe out humanity until the world learns to fight back.  Now the world is still dealing the ramifications of such a war and the author has interviewed key characters who played significant roles in an order to understand how we got to where we are.<br /><br />This book is very interesting.  The premise and concept are the strongest aspects of this book.  While the world battled zombies, you get the notation that the fallout could really apply to any major world threat.  It is really fascinating to see how the events unfold through the different narrations.  Some of it hits really close to home and the events seem so realistic (yes, even with the zombies!).<br /><br />Some of the narrations drag a bit, but some are really mind blowing.  So, why did I only give it 3.5 stars?  While I think this book has an amazing concept and is carried out extremely well, it isn't the type of book I generally enjoy.  Sad to say, it was almost a little too realistic for me and creeped me out a lot!  I wouldn't survive in an apocalyptic situation very well I'm afraid because just reading about it gives me anxiety!<br /><br />But, I will say, I know that there are a lot of people who will absolutely love this type of book and I wholeheartedly recommend to those people!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|So, I got this as a suggested read through Kindle and after reading the synopsis, got over myself on the $9.99 price (I love the freebies and under $6 books, lol).  This book is a blend of erotic romantic fantasy fiction and if anyone is looking for \\"real life\\" or something of that nature, stop right here.  It's a terrifically fun read with a twist (that quite frankly, seems to have spawned an interesting dialogue if my friends and colleagues are anything to judge by, lol).  I happen to read a lot of erotic and BDSM oriented fiction for fun so this didn't phase me (I didn't see it as \\"mommy porn\\" or \\"mommy Twilight\\" - although it was clear Twilight was an inspiration, lol).  Most importantly, I loved it!!!!  It was exactly what I wanted to read and the perfect escapism that fiction books are supposed to be!  I won't get into the plot or anything (there are almost 11,000 reviews as I write this!), but I do want to say this:  the trilogy is emotive (if you let yourself get into it rather than critique it) and it's romantic and it's about 2 flawed people (mostly Christian) who find each other and want to make it work.  Isn't that the definition of romance?<br /><br />I ready 50 Shades in one evening after work and immediately downloaded the second one (for another $10!!, lol) and the next night downloaded the 3rd (another $10!!) and then read them all over again (4 days, (2 were a weekend) and I read the whole trilogy twice.  It was evocotive....so let yourself read and enjoy rather than worrying about how a 27 YO can be a billionaire and stuff like that - isn't that the fun of it all!???<br /><br />Oh and about the Marketing Maven Comment:  read wikipedia - EL James really started from the grass roots level and it spawned a series that eclipsed Harry Potter - how cool is that????

1469984202|4.0|I had a great time with this book, it was a real page turner - or button pusher to be exact, since I read it on my Kindle.  I'm sure I can't really say anything positive about this book that hasn't already been said in the hundreds of reviews that have already been posted here, however what I can say is that for the price this book is definitely worth buying and reading and I will strongly recommend it.<br /><br />That being said there were a few segments that really required the suspension of disbelief, beyond the usual that is to be expected with science fiction.  Specifically, pretty much any time the protagonist gets into a suit something completely off the charts ridiculous happens.  This is made all the more surreal because you know that the protagonist is going to survive the ordeal, you just have to turn the page to see what Deus ex machina is about to get \\"unexpectedly\\" pulled out of a hat.<br /><br />The one that really got me and turned this review from 5 stars to 4 stars was the diving incident.  I have tried to avoid spoilers in this review but I will say this much - the author should never have written himself into that situation if he wasn't prepared to let someone die.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Got such a great price in order to \\"catch up\\" on all the episodes we had missed, that we couldn't pass it up!!

0307887448|4.0|I read this on a recent week-long camping trip, and had fun with it.<br /><br />It starts out with the author's axe to grind against God and creating a fantasy world in which God is a myth akin to Santa and the easter bunny, but once it gets going it was (for me) a fun re-living past enjoyments. I remember a lot of the games and geeky references to the 70's and 80's, and actually guessed the answer to one of the puzzle-quest's riddles before the main character got it. That was kinda fun.<br /><br />The last third of the book started to become epic and grand, and I can see this being an enjoyable blockbuster movie, and Warner Brothers agrees so we just might see this make it to the big screen.<br /><br />My favorite gaming element is exploration, and because the protagonist is on a quest to find clue s and keys etc, it has a lot of searching and exploration.<br /><br />I disliked a section near the middle where not much happened for a while and the main character was despondent and planning out his suicide. That was quite a disconnect from the same clever character who a few pages earlier had everything going for him, and was fired-up about getting each piece of the puzzle figured out.<br /><br />As to others saying they didn't like it because they didn't spend their teen years in the 70's and 80's, my 15 yr old nephew read this before I did and was pretty enthused about it, and insisted I read it. I think you get a lot more out of this book if you catch the references, but it seems it can be enjoyed by a younger reader as well.<br /><br />I would have liked seeing a few more of my less-well-known geeky favs mentioned, but I think everyone would and I think the author was probably wise to stick to references with wider appeal. I would have liked references to Clan Lord (the grand-daddy to WoW) or Trade Wars (a popular BBS \\"doorway\\" game on early BBS systems pre-internet)<br /><br />All the references aside (they were integral to the puzzle), I liked the character's resourcefulness and attitude most of the time, and had fun rooting for the good guy.esourcefulness and attitude most of the time, and had fun rooting for the good guy.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I am amazed by Martins' abililty to develope characters that you route for and some of the most dispicable characters ever created in literature. The problem is the use of these characters. The saga continues and more story lines are added to the already over inundated story. Nothing is concluded. I did not feel any closer to resolution after this book than when I began. As I have from the beginning, I feel almost beaten up at points. In conclusion, with the extraordinary length of this novel, I am very disappointed with the result. Unfortunately, It is impossible for me to give up on a series one I start. If you don't have this issue, I don't recommend this book.
B004LWZW6U|3.0|In the interest of fairness and full disclosure, I must admit that PIRANHA in any \\"D\\" is not my kind of movie.  Usually, I try to avoid watching films of this genre because I hate losing those 90-120 minutes of my life that I can never get back again.<br /><br />Also, since I do not own a 3-D Blu-Ray player or television set, I opted to watch this movie on regular DVD.<br /><br />That said, I have no doubt that this sequel to PIRANHA 3D (2010) will more than please the audience for which it was intended (i.e. people who enjoy watching movies in which monster fish eat other people.)  In fact, Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames, both of whom were in the first picture, are back for this one.<br /><br />The JAWS-like plot is set in moneymaking Big Wet Water Park where the prehistoric flesh-eating fish find a smorgasbord on the attraction's opening day of summer.<br /><br />The problem with this picture, directed by John Gulager, is that the filmmakers can't seem to decide whether they wanted to make an all out horror film or an all out spoof.  As it turned out, the movie is neither.  In the first half, the gore factor is just too much to evoke laughs, and some of the humorous sequences attempted (e.g. a sex scene with disastrous results) are too ridiculous to be funny.<br /><br />Truthfully, while watching the movie, I was tempted several times to turn the damn thing off...but I'm glad that I didn't, because about midway through, David Hasselhoff makes his first appearance (playing himself and making light of his public image), and then PIRANHA 3DD becomes fun...even for me.  It becomes the all out spoof that it should have been from the start.<br /><br />Hasselhoff is terrific, as are Lloyd and Rhames, who are obviously enjoying their roles.  Also in the cast are Gary Busey, Danielle Panabaker, Matt Bush, David Koechner and the director's father, Clu Gulager.<br /><br />The 3-disc (3D, Blu-Ray, DVD) combo pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains many extras, including a \\"Making of\\" featurettes, deleted scenes and bloopers.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I like this game. It is different from the other angry bird games because you're dealing with gravitational fields and such. You never know whether your bird is going to fly straight and spin around the world or bounce off and go backwards. But it's fun and the kids like it.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|I finally caught this movie at a drive-in as part of a double feature. It is a fairly similar telling of the Snow White fairy tale; however, it has too many flaws:<br /><br />--Some of the background stories were vague and confusing.<br />--The Huntsman \\"awakens\\" Snow White and before she bites the apple she claims the prince is her \\"true love\\".<br />--Kristen at times acts well, but in some scenes she looks distant and uninteresting.<br />--The Huntsman is a lonely drunkard who longs to be with his dead wife, but instantly becomes sober and strong and in love with Snow White.<br />--The movie is very dark and cold.<br /><br />Because we were at a drive-in theater when we saw this movie, we ended up poking fun of it and talking instead of watching it.
0812550706|3.0|This book takes a section from Robert Heinlein's \\"Citizen of the Galaxy\\", with young adolescents having the reponsiblility of firing space weapons (reaction time faster than that of an adult-c.f video games), then expanding to a whole book.  I found it a decent read, but not by any means 5 star quality of a science fiction novel.
0670022411|5.0|And I mean that in the best kind of way. This book has the same magnetic appeal and chemistry between main characters that Twilight has, and there are many similarities between the plot lines--disapproval on both sides of the relationship, forbidden love, lots of romantic teasing, a woman whose need for protection inspires immediate attraction, etc. But, this is actually well written and engaging on a more mature level. The plot is a lot more complex and interesting with characters who are much more believable. I really enjoyed it and will probably reread it several times as I do with all of my favorite escapist literature.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I bought this game for my grand kids, and they enjoy it, but I enjoy it also. Takes a lot of thought on many of the levels. And it is funny and cute.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|After seeing the original foreign version of this story called LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, I was prepared for another over-produced, over-wrought American version...but I am pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />In fact, I think I like this version better.  Set in a dark, wintry New Mexico with 80's songs playing just within hearing, this story about a lonely, bullied young boy who befriends a mysterious barefoot girl knows what needs to be done to tell a good story while not wallowing in gory excess.  Which is not to say there's none, but it's always just the right amount that the effects never overwhelm the story.  One definite improvement: I loved the attacks, which are so jarring as they come from a sweet little girl.  They also lend a poignancy to the scenes where she's trying to just find someone to connect with.<br /><br />One thing I would've addressed: was the little girl's \\"father\\" in the first half of the film once a child with her who ages as a human?  Kind of a dovetailing moment that could've been underscored a little clearer.<br /><br />But I'm quibbling.  An excellent horror film for all the fans who are tired of the mindless gorefests we have to endure these days.

B001FW58D6|1.0|Bad time to be writing this, but I just finished episode 11 (Bound). This killed the series for me.  This is the episode where the show leaves any plausibility in the dust and ends up shoveling in one plot contrivance after another.  We are in soap opera 101 territory here.<br /><br />Just a few of the events that happen in this one episode (spoilers coming):<br /><br />1. Agent Dunham kills or incapacitates three different men when she escapes from a warehouse where they are performing some insidious operation on her. She immediately decides to LEAVE  THE CRIME SCENE so she can bury some evidence and then return. Why not call it in and wait for someone to show up?<br /><br />2. By the time the FBI shows up the warehouse is \\"empty\\".  Gee, that's a real lucky break for the \\"conspiracy\\", isn't it?<br /><br />3. Later, upon waking up handcuffed to a hospital bed, Agent Dunham discovers she's been placed under investigation by Internal Affairs and the person placed in charge of the investigation is the very same man she put away for sexual harassment three years earlier.  Not only has the harassment case been overturned and he's leading the investigation, BUT BOTH REVELATIONS ARE A COMPLETE SHOCK TO HER.  What law enforcement official would actively ignore the appeals process for a case they led?<br /><br />4. Once she leaves the hospital, her sister and niece show up and they all go to Dunham's house to have spaghetti: This happens with no bodyguard assigned to her on THE SAME DAY SHE WAS ABDUCTED.<br /><br />I don't mind the junk science, and the acting and production are really well done, but if you are constantly being reminded that this is all a manipulation by some 2nd rate screen writer to keep you watching the show, then what's the point?
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like this more than the mobile site. I've only had a couple glitches (nothing a close and reopen didn't fix). I'm so glad Android finally offered an app. :-)<br />Would love to see more (or at least an easier way) editing options as far as changing board names and such.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|its fun and addicting and there is always missions 2 complete! I'm never bored and its challenging but not too hard I love it!  awesome game highly recommend
B0060FXDCG|5.0|three great movies .a must see... i sat down and watched all three without stopping...love the action. Loved all three of the movies
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is gripping and intense. I couldn't decide which character to like at times, however the ending disappointed me. The rest was so good that I've still decided to give it a high 4.
034580404X|2.0|I was quite disappointed after all of the talk and reviews I had heard and read.  It did not live up to the hype.  The second book was a bore.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it had a solution button for some of the harder puzzles. But I have been able to solve all of them so far, just that some took a while...
B004SBULWE|5.0|Just editing this dumb thumb review.<br />I have this on all my androids.  It makes life so easy and closes cleanly all those apps that want to stay open even when you are not using them. You know those that won't stay closed when you force them to close.  The cool part is that you get to choose which apps you don't want to be closed automatically by this app.  Get this app it is great!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I decided to get the much talked about book. It was downloaded immediately to my Kindle. Before I ordered it, I got a preview downloaded to my Kindle immediately also and it was free. I enjoyed the book also.  Had a surprise ending
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Controls and gameplay are done well. Graphics are good. Only possible complaint is that it could use a play by play tutorial, but even without that, it only took a turn or two to figure out the basics. Solo game play is preserved if you leave the game to make a phone call or whatever, so you start the game back up and you're right where you left off. - droid2 global<br /><br />Update: Turns out there is already a tutorial! Just start a campaign and you get walked through. Already learned a few new tricks.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Thought this book was a little too much of the same \\"SEX---SEX---AND MORE SEX\\"  I thought it could of had a little more story line.  Oh well \\"Live and Learn---------\\"  Whew did I ever!!
B0036T32LQ|1.0|Told the wrong way, this movie is like a joke. No wait. This movie is like a joke, told the wrong way. That pretty much sums up the reason this movie gets one star. It aspires to achieve an amazing effect, but if falls flat. The problem is with the mechanics of the script. And to all the viewers out there that left shinning reviews, you should change your name to Jack and lock yourself in a hotel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Time consuming but fun. Lots of fun games to play. Best game on the market to have on device. Great game.
B008XG1X18|1.0|junk...doesn't work and now I cant even uninstall it. it wont open and it wont unistall and it is a waste of space.
098357670X|4.0|A great reference to an aspiring cartoonist. The basics are detailed. In a few weeks of constant practice, you can draw like Tom Richmond. Now the pages are all starting to come out because of frequent reading. It is glued and not stitched. But if you plan on just keeping it on your drawer to maintain the mint condition, it really doesn't matter.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|Wonderful album with all of the essentials.. Excellent sound quality and Beatles Greatest Songs!  A must have for someone who does not have all of the Beatles albums.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Clearly, this non-fiction book about the relationships between U.S. presidents since Herbert Hoover is one of the best books I have ever read, political or otherwise.  The authors bring these presidents to life, detailing their challenges and accomplishments and, most of all, their relationships between each other.  Whether they were from the same party to not, they seem to belong to a private club in which the impact of their difficult decisions effects the whole world.  The responsibility is humongous and the effects are far reaching.  And each president has, in turn, had to make decisions that took chances on the future.  This bound them together in a unique way and gave them  a very special kind of world view.<br /><br />The book is so well written that it was hard to believe it was all non-fiction.  There were parts that were so exciting that I literally held my breath as I was reading.  Some of the details might have been public knowledge but I sure didn't know about them and every page of this 656- page book taught me something new about presidential policies and as well as the character and personality of each individual president.<br /><br />These presidents came from different parties and had different challenges and yet each one valued each other's wisdom and found more in common with each other than they did differences.<br /><br />I loved every minute of this book and was sorry to see it end.  I also came away with a richer understanding of American history and a deeper respect for them all.
B0042JIL24|5.0|thanks for an excellent box, all in perfect condition<br />good sound, I'll watch for future purchases<br />thank you very much for everything
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love it! perfect game and challenge for puzzle freaks. looks easy at first glance, but I had to start over a few times
0887307280|5.0|I run a semi successful business. I'm not even half through the book and it's becoming crystal clear what MUST change to make my business thrive.  Excellent read and highly recommended.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I'm a 12 year old reading maniac, so I know a good book when I see one. Percy jackson caught my attention because I was look for something on mythology and my sister told me about about a book she was currently reading called The Lightning Thief. When I read the first five chapters I was completey drawn to it.I could relate to percy and I admired the idea of greek ledgends mixing with moderntimes.Every page I read increased my imagination of monsters,gods,heroes,and olympus. I recommend this to parents who have kids that enjoy reading about heroes and myths
B002ZG98C8|1.0|Easily the worst movie I've ever seen. Subversive, anti-American, not even B quality. DeNiro has lost his mind associating himself with a piece of crap like this. Go ahead, watch it.... You'll agree I just wasted my time even reviewing it.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Story written mostly in monologues or dialogues. Sex parts are kind of \\"stretchy\\" for my taste and totaly for a very absent minded read. Not very attractive scenes, after reading couple of them I wanted to go and wash off those ideas of my memory and wash my hands. Some billionaire and a school girl! How cliché! And as a friend of mine said: the writing is by a mature woman who writes about virgin??? Naaa. I put it down after the 1st toasty seen and was glad that I recognized this \\"read\\"...or maybe I was looking for something interesting and found something overly-simplistic...<br /><br />anyway - not recommended read<br /><br />Why two stars??? I liked it until I realized what it was
0790731940|5.0|it is the funniest movie iv'e seen in a long time,it is just great,i watch it at least 2 or 3 times a day,i will recomened to any body.

B0086700CM|4.0|You know that scene in Indiana Jones where Indy is running from a giant boulder trap? That is what this game is like.<br /><br />You take control of an adventurer who has stolen the Idol and is making a run for it. Controls are smooth, graphics are simple but cool,  and the story,  a guy running from Killer Monkeys,  is hilarious in it's own kind of way. This game is amazing,  and I'm glad it came to the Amazon App Store!<br />-Ace The Master
B008MEM24S|5.0|I bought this for my four year old. however, I can't stop playing it myself. :-)  it's a clever game and seems to run well on my kindle fire.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Easily the best white noise app.  Made a huge difference in sleep patterns.  Great features...particularly like being able to mix and meld sounds and adjust volume for each sound.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|My husband and I bought these cases and absolutely love them!! We went snorkeling in Hawaii and took a lot of cool underwater pictures. Amazing case!!! And fast service!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The book moves at a slow pace, without a great deal of action per se, yet is filled with tension about what will happen next.  It takes unexpected twists and turns, one in particular that caught me entirely by surprise.  It reveals the back story slowly, and that back story fits well with the present tense narrative. The main characters are interesting.  Much of it is depressing but the book as a whole is quite to the contrary. It is very well written.  It has the nicest three sentence description of death that I've ever read. If you accept this book on its terms, it is a very good read.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was the first mystery type of novel I read. it was pretty good and led me to read her other two books out which were good as well.
1476712042|1.0|The main character in this book is a dysfunctional tool and a selfish lover. He needs mental help stat! The twit who falls for this joker needs a dose of self esteem. I was embarrassed for them. If i went to college with these yahoos, I would transfer !

B003N0XDT4|1.0|The audio in the R channel failed after a couple months of use as a DAC. Tried to return it to Fiio (it was still under their warranty). They wanted me to personally ship it to China for $80, more than it is worth. When I pointed this out, customer service stonewalled me.  Don't do business with Fiio.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A very good game to play. Need more like it. I think people would like to play this game- because it reminds you of the good old days
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how you can share your plans with your friends. it has really helped me get closer to God.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great especially when you are board you can play a lot of games and it is challenging
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great trilogy.  The last book was great and kept me guessing until the end.  I read all three while recuperating at home.  I loved them all!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|in great shape, came in its original package (just as described). it arrived before its estimated arrival date. great to do business with.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play Solitaire just about every night before going to bed. It's very difficult for mr to stop playing once I get started and I'm up til the wee hours.  The cards are bright colors and very easy to see.  I'm 76 years old and love this card game.
B003Y5H4Y8|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />'The Debt' is based on a 2007 Israeli film of the same name. The basic plot is the same: three Mossad agents, two men and a woman, attempt to kidnap a Nazi war criminal in East Berlin in 1965 and ferret him back to Israel for trial.<br /><br />Of course the main idea is taken from the actual abduction of Eichmann in Argentina in 1960. There are two main differences between the actual historical event and what we see here. First of all, and most important, the Mossad operation to abduct Eichmann, albeit extremely difficult, was possible as the agents were operating in a relatively free country (as compared to the countries of the Soviet bloc). To accept the idea that the Mossad would even consider attempting to ferret a Nazi war criminal out of East Germany at the height of the Cold War, that's something I had a hard time believing. Even the Mossad, I believe, would have considered such a plan as 'too risky'.<br /><br />The second principal difference between the Eichmann abduction and the one in 'The Debt', is that the fictional Nazi war criminal the Mossad agents abduct, 'Dieter Vogel', is modeled on the sadistic doctor of Auschwitz, Josef Mengele, and not the banal bureaucrat, Eichmann. Like the Vogel character, Mengele posed as a gynecologist, performing illegal abortions after the war. The real-life Eichmann proves much more interesting than the fictional Vogel, pretty much a standard Nazi film villain. Eichmann, on the other hand, is fascinating since he hardly fits the mold of the typical sadistic Nazi--rather, he resembled the ordinary German you might casually bump into randomly on the street--an individual one would hardly suspect as the chief facilitator of the Final Solution.<br /><br />If you think about it, it didn't take a whole lot of imagination on the screenwriters' part to come up with the main plot, which involves a true-life, successful intelligence operation, turned on its head. 'The Debt' in effect is an Eichmann-like abduction gone bad. There is a historical precedent for a botched Mossad operation--the Lillehammer affair, where the Mossad assassinated the wrong man in their quest to eliminate one of the leaders of the Munich massacre. That's a more likely scenario than the unlikely events depicted here. While the botched escape at the train station hardly seemed true to life, at least it was suspenseful. But when Vogel manages to untie himself and escape the apartment, the entire scenario seemed a little too convenient. Worse is the awkward denouement, where Helen Mirren playing the middle-aged heroine Rachel Singer, travels to Ukraine and ends up getting herself done in by the Nazi antagonist, only to dispatch him at the last second (and in the nick of time).<br /><br />It's not that I disliked the whole idea of Singer paying off her debt to her country--it's just that I couldn't believe an aging, retired Mossad agent, would take it upon herself to 'finish the job' herself. It's good for the movies but even retired Mossad agents realize there are certain protocols involved in various intelligence missions and one doesn't 'go rogue', especially when one is pushing seventy.<br /><br />'The Debt' is generally well-acted but in the end, I just didn't care about the love triangle which forms the basis of a rather tedious sub-plot. There was also a lack of continuity between the actors who were playing the younger roles and the older ones depicted in the present day.<br /><br />Perhaps what the film scenarists were getting at is that actors in organizations such as the Mossad, which is generally thought of as pretty favorable in the west, are also fallible. The protagonist certainly redeems herself in the end by sacrificing her life but do we really care? The absurd romantic angle grows tedious and we never become truly invested in the antagonist, who lacks a back story and is more a caricature, than a fleshed out human being.ffect is an Eichmann-like abduction gone bad.

B00884GR0W|4.0|The premise of this game is nothing new. A lot of reviews call Block Story a rip off of Minecraft, but that assertion is simply not true. This game is quite well put together and very fun. The learning curve is pretty simple (my 4 year old son plays it and loves it) yet it is in depth enough that it can take some mastery to do more advanced tasks.<br /><br />Pros: At $4.98, it is a little bit more expensive than most games here. That being said, this is a very expansive and well put together game. You are certainly getting a good product for the price. The world is simple for newcomers, yet challenging enough to keep you coming back.<br /><br />Cons: Mainly technical issues. Sometimes things don't render correctly, and then my Fire will freeze up making me have to reset. Other than that I have few complaints that would just fall into the nitpicky category.<br /><br />Final score: Fix the technical issues and it would get five stars. Right now it sits at 4/5 stars.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Well, it's been what 37 years now?  I remember seeing it at the drive-in as a child.  It wowed me then and it still wows me today.  The picture is so clean and crisp.  If you love the movie then this is definitely a must-have bluray.  I think we will have to invest in a 7.1 sound system just for this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|OMGGGG!!!!!My little sister cant put this down! !!I loove it she loooves it lol. She just beat my highscore lol BTW :she's only 4lol..... looove it I totally recommend this for ur 4 year old sister lol! !!<br /><br />  Damaiya and little Sister Deanna &lt;3
B0001WGDXK|3.0|Bernstein recorded a cycle for Sony and it is out of print. It's fine, you can just get whatever parts you find used.[Edit: Now available in a BOX set]<br /><br />This is the older Bernstein's view of Sibelius with slow tempi. They fit quite well with symphony 1 and 2. The 5th and 7th disc is also interesting, but have not made up my mind on it. OK, I bought the DVD as well, and am now enjoying his 7th.<br /><br />The discs had to use filler for the first two discs, though Sibelius tone poems would have been better. But this is all they had.<br /><br />Live recordings, good sound recordings. The Elgar and Britten pieces are fine as far as I can tell.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very addicitve...I just wish it would show u what level u r on. and show what ur points r.
B00886184A|5.0|Gentle Giant's underrated final album, \\"Civilian,\\" was ignored throughout all the previous remastering jobs. For this boxed set, it finally got the treatment it deserves, and the result is nothing short of a revelation. The album is finally a joy to hear, and every song has a deliberation and punch that sells its intention and works magically. A good remastering job has finally made this album great. It's amazing how that works.<br />In addition, this mastering job on \\"The Missing Piece\\" blows away the 35th Anniversary release. The album finally has the depth and low end it deserves, showing needed reverence to Ray Shulman's bass parts, and Weathers' drums have had their full-range power restored  - it completely transforms the \\"Missing Piece\\" songs from the tinny, poppy diversions they seemed to be on the first CD release to fully entertaining, energy-infused prog-pop-rock, and the album is a blast from start to finish.<br />The version of \\"Free Hand\\" in this set, which starts the whole affair, is unfortunately unusually compressed - too much so - which excites the mix nicely but squashes the dynamic range (and actually introduces mid-range distortion in vocals, snare, and cymbals at times). It's not a disaster (and is notable in its own way), but the 35th Anniversary remaster wins out in the case of Free Hand.<br />Overall, though, this box is easily worth twice the price for the remastering jobs of The Missing Piece and Civilian - and Gentle Giant fans will enjoy the bonus tracks as well.
1594202842|1.0|While this book is well written, her attitude is so terrible towards her children that I could not even finish the book. I read CONSTANTLY and I rarely will not finish a book, but I could not stomach this one. I skipped ahead and read the last 10 pages thinking it would possibly end better, but it did not.

B008P1EWIM|5.0|Putting it simply, [[ASIN:B008P1EWIM Weather Live]] is an excellent, nicely customizable app on the Kindle Fire or the Kindle Fire HD series. Have tried a few of them here, and this one really stands out. What makes this one stand out is not just its beauty on the screen, but that it uses AccuWeather to get its data, then presents it so well on the screen.<br /><br />Once downloaded, you can set the formats for the temperature, wind speed, pressure and time. You can change the layout to all details, short-term forecast, long-term forecast, current state only or text only. You can set it for multiple locations (tip: use your zip code) and then switch between them with a horizontal swipe across the screen. And the dynamic backgrounds make it a pleasure to see as you're getting the overview of your own weather.<br /><br />Have used [[ASIN:B005K17RU0 AccuWeather for Android]], and it's very good, with its weather maps and such. But as far as ease of use once it set up and configure for how you want to view your own climate conditions, [[ASIN:B008P1EWIM Weather Live]] may be the perfect choice if you don't need or want the extras that AccuWeather offers.<br /><br />Should note that the same developer makes [[ASIN:B008RA3X5E My Alarm Clock]], an app that stands alone in terms of having such a good looking and highly functional interface, and it works quite well. Both of these are highly recommended to all who are looking for efficient apps that work well on the Kindle Fire or the Kindle Fire HD series, and look good as well.<br /><br />Updated 12/5/2012
B000I174QO|1.0|The beginning of the movie is visually exciting and has some interesting metaphors.  Alas, after that, it just wanders around grasping at allegory.  It's sort of wacky.  Sometimes it's almost funny. I wish that Jerry Lewis hadn't agreed to do this -- he can be so funny, but in this one, it just seemed needy and grasping.<br />Oh yes -- having had a suicide in my immediate family, that plot thread dampened my excitement - sort of scary actually. Some nice scenery -- I like the dogs.<br /><br />Maybe I should have just read the book.  (lame joke - this couldn't have enough plot contiguity to make a book out of it).
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I had heard about Evernote about 8 months ago from a coworker at my last job. I had kind of dismissed it. But, at my new job, I started seeing other coworkers and managers using it so I thought I'd try it out. It's very handy to be able to take notes in a meeting on your laptop and have them with you on your phone or tablet whenever you want them. I'm finding new ways to organize my notes and still finding out about all the cool features that Evernote provides.
B007UW9VWO|5.0|Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a well-paced documentary about a single man and his seventy-five year quest to perfect his craft. Say what you will about his character, the lives of his sons, or the over-fishing of tuna, Jiro is a man who shows undying dedication to his craft, and that is an admirable quality.<br /><br />All great documentaries should do two things. 1. They should teach you something you didn't know about a very niche topic. I learned a lot about sushi, its preparation, and the problems the tuna population faces today. 2. They should teach you something applicable to all of life. Jiro's dedication, his dedication to taking his time to make his product the right way and always improve, is a fine example for life.<br /><br />I recognize that Jiro's oldest son looks miserable and broken through most of the documentary. I realize there are no women in it, except a customer who eats a piece of sushi. This is a review of the film, not of the Japanese culture or Jiro's character. This documentary held my attention for its entire length and left me with questions about life and when I can next get a hold of some sushi.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it but its pretty much like Mario bros Lep has an interesting story a tornado?All so suddento him.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Even though some of the reviews looked planted this game is awesome. It doesn't have in app purchases. It is really easy to grasp and challenging on the harder difficulties. One of the better games on the market.
B005LMEB8E|5.0|This cd is truly amazing. Demi's voice has become so strong and many of the songs are full of emotion. If you want a great cd, I highly recommend this one!
B007C4E1R0|5.0|I was very impressed by the timely manner the book arrived.  I love to read. This is a great book, a definite must read! First you must read the girl with the dragon tattoo and the girl who played with fire by the same author.
0143143492|5.0|I listened to the CDs many times and every time I listened my understanding of it grew deeper. The sentences speak truth, so deep and so intense, I was not able to grasp the meanings in one listening while I am driving. I have heard of \\"ego\\", \\"Living in the Moment\\", \\"Awareness\\" in many spiritual programs, read many books about them, but have not understood fully until I listened to these CDs. I am planning to get other CDS from Tolle.
B007V508CC|5.0|It is awesome ~ I loved all the songs, not just the current hit Payphone which is constantly on the radio. Glad to have the CD!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love,  love, this app with it's great graphics that are large and easy to see. The feature that I like the best shows how long you have for the different tasks that your device offers and whether you're utilizing wifi or other.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very good game but it is increasingly difficult to gain coins. overall a great concept for a game. loved it.
B007Z9R69M|1.0|Maybe is was the unnecessary scenes featuring the main character being pummeled by men, or perhaps it was the ridiculous dialogue that did nothing to advance the film in any way, but Steven Soderbergh (director of Contagion) move featuring Gina Carano (MMA Star) didn't quite do it for me. The movie has its moments, but its few and far between. It mostly looks like a long music video and sounds like a home movie but doesn't have any of the symbolism or charm of neither. The plot is there just to make people fight each other and the choreography doesn't take full advantage of the star's abilities. Characters are introduced for no reason, I'm not sure of many of the character's motivations, and the ending is corny and baffling.<br /><br />On the other hand, Nina is probably the most believable female action star I've seen in a while (I am sure she can whoop my behind easily). She's not the typical 85 pound model KOing baddies with a right cross. A few times she does use jiujitsu and leg kicks that have made her infamous in the MMA world. Antonio Banderas phones in another performance but still manages to steal every scene he's in -- but then again it's not like he has much competition. The real winner is Amazon for charging me $5 for the garbage.
0142419400|3.0|This book was highly recommended and was raved to be one of the best love stories out there, so I had pretty high hopes. Unfortunately, it was not the five star I was expecting.<br /><br />The book was cute but too predictable. It's pretty much the whole young girl meets handsome boy with British accent, falls for him but unfortunately he has a girlfriend, but hey they fall in love. Though the story wasn't as original, I couldn't help but smile at many parts.<br /><br />I liked how Anna grows up in the book and comes to learn that people need second chances. I also enjoyed the fact that even though she was in France, she still stayed \\"innocent.\\" I really enjoyed her character.<br /><br />In all, this was a very delightful summer read.
