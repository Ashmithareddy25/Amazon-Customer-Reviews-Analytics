B00COGY2P2|5.0|If you like mission impossible you will love this movie as well.  I would watch it again.  Good Movie.  Yay.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|While this app seems awesome, it has too many downfalls to be regularly played.  The first is requiring gold tokens to play a game, and you have to buy those or wait however long for the scratch off mini game to let you play (or you could pay to play the scratch off game).<br />Second is there are power ups you can buy that feel a bit cheat-y to me.<br />Third, the app is constantly trying to get me to agree to let it post on my Facebook.<br /><br />I would not recommend this app.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|This movie was pretty good.  I love Tom Cruise and I LOVE anything Morgan Freeman is in.  I would watch it again.
0312117337|5.0|These are the best tarot cards in my opinion, I would recommend them to everyone, and anyone who is searching for their own authentic being. Osho helps you light your own way.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|This is a good remake as it translate the original story to the modern times. However it does not beat the original with Kevin Bacon!
B00004Z400|4.0|The third DEFTONES album WHITE PONY is regarded by many hardcore DEFTONES fans as the band's most creative and experimental effort to date. While I do think this album is an amazing improvement over their past two albums, I don't think this is the point where DEFTONES completely diversified themselves from the pack (that comes much later in their career). However, WHITE PONY did introduce their signature sound and the album is obviously fantastic. There are two tracks that I find to be mediocre, and these are PINK MAGGIT and KNIFE PARTY. The latter song starts off alright, but the high-pitched singing vocals from RODLEEN kind of took me out of the song. The previous is a rather boring closer track, and I think the preceding track CHANGE IN THE HOUSE OF FLIES would've worked much better as a closer of the album. However, two disappointing tracks don't make me dislike an album. The rest of the album is filled with typical heavy DEFTONES tracks such as FEITICEIRA, ELITE, STREET CARP, and KOREA, as well as more experimental tracks such as DIGITAL BATH, TEENAGER, and PASSENGER. Overall, I find this album to be a very fantastic album that has aged very well since its debut in 2000, albeit having a few mediocre tracks.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I can't believe I have finally finished this book. It felt so much longer than the first one. I did, however, put it down many, many times. At some parts I just couldn't get into the flow of things and wasn't really bothered to find out what would happen next. If this wasn't a TV series, I probably wouldn't have finished, but I wanted to watch the episodes so I continued reading. I knew there is something about these books that everyone loved and I knew the TV series would cut some stuff out.<br /><br />This book was basically about the Renly and Stannis wanting to take over King's Landing. It was mostly fighting and taking out castles and being captured and the such. I don't want to say what happens because I don't want to give anything away. If you read the first one, then you obviously have to read this one because I am pretty sure you will read the next one.<br /><br />All I have to say is.... GO KHALESSI! I love Danaerys! :)
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It would be better if you got more cash from the missiles. Faster enemies would also make it better also.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This book was amazing. Another too long story for my liking but amazing regardless! This was much better than book two. So much happened in this book that I can't even begin to describe it. The author did a great job pulling us into his world of dragons, knights, killings, kings and plain ol' whores. I loved it! I can't wait to read the next one.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|It crashes all the time not recomendable FOR kindle FIRE hd, I want My money back l will uninstall it right now
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a show that grandmother, mother, and teen daughter are absolutely crazy about!!! We loved every minute and would have watched the whole season at once if we could! One of the best series ever!
B004ZN9W5M|4.0|I light up my cigarette, put my headphones on to this CD, and just glide down the street in complete serenity. 4 and not 5 stars because the 320kbps doesn't really sound like it, I have to use the windows and itunes volume adjustment to make them audible (only on certain tracks though).
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Love it. Best stylus pen I've purchased. Has three tips, different sizes, and each one works perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone. I've bought cheaper ones before but they didn't last as long.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I have not quite finished this book yet, but I've read far enough to know that it is a compelling, suspenseful read.  I am enjoying it very much and look forward to seeing how everything works out.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Love these books ! Once you start reading them you can't put them down ! Warning they are ad ducting !
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'd been waiting for (& dreaming about) something like this for a very long time. I have a Roku XD/s player, but Roku doesn't play well with Google, so I was never able to watch YouTube, or listen to my Google Music All Access. The Roku did support Netflix, but it was really flaky - Every time the network bandwidth fluctuated, the thing would stop, re-buffer, and re-start in low-res mode.<br /><br />Drove me nuts.<br /><br />Not only does the Chromecast support the &#34;missing Google services&#34; Roku doesn't support, it's MUCH more reliable... Rather than constantly stopping, and re-starting, it dynamically adjusts resolution during bandwidth fluctuations, and does it so well, it's barely noticeable.<br /><br />If you absolutely must stream local content from your PC or phone, stick with Roku (the XD/s supported that pretty well), but if you want the simplest, most reliable streamer of cloud media, this thing's a winner.<br /><br />Great work, Google!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Was great i loved every min of it.  Can not wait to watch the rest of it when is out
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thought it was a little hard to get into, but once all the characters were introduced, it was hard to put down.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, but it was still a good read and probably would read other books by this author.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It is a fun an  semi addicting game. It isn't the best that I have played though. Make the picture bigger
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Simply loved this book! So beautifully written that I often stopped to marvel at how wonderful those words were together. Hazel and Augustus are smart and witty and young and even more alive than most people because they exist closer to death than most. John Green was able to write about pain in such a way that it was both joyful and more painful at the same time. Brilliant!
B005HSL626|4.0|Its fun an other devices but on the kindle fire, it is slow. I like it but I suggest not to get it. Try getting Jetpack Joyride instead.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|This well-written, well-acted series was canceled even before a full single season had aired ... proof that TV executives sometimes don't have a clue what they are doing. This is far better than some similar space dramas that have survived and thrived across multiple seasons. Had this show not had the plug pulled so quickly, it very well might have become one of the more successful examples of its genre. As it is, it is quite interesting to see cast members perform exceptionally well in roles far different (yet with similar characteristics) from those they currently are performing with much greater professional, critical and financial success -- especially Christina Hendricks (Mad Men), Gina Torres (Suits) and Summer Glau (Sarah Connor Chronicles).
B002ZG983M|5.0|The movie was great. It was pretty funny and different. I can't wait to see Kick Ass 2. Good buy.
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|This has become one of my top four or five favorite movies.  I recorded it from satellite just a few weeks ago, then ordered the DVD so I can clear it off the DVR and own it forever!  When Billy dances I smile from ear to ear.  I usually don't like musicals turned into movies, but this is a gem.  You don't have to particularly like ballet or classical music because the story is everything.  Besides, Billy's dance is very energetic and not all ballet moves.  There is some classical in the soundtrack but it is mostly T.Rex.  I don't want to give any more away, but it is a wonderful story!
0762451319|1.0|I received this package quicker than most packages which is always a good thing. when I opened it, the box was damaged. the picture made it look much bigger than it actually is, I was expecting something a bit larger. I didn't care too much about the size, or packaging, but I took the necklace and put it on, then about two hours later, I took it off to take a shower, and the clasp just broke. I never have given negative feedback before, but this just angered me a bit because it was 12 dollars for a broken necklace, small tattoos and magnets.
193700788X|5.0|Ahead of schedule and top notch!! Loved this series of books and I am sad to see it over with. Wish there were more, but hey Sookie needs a break from danger now!!
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|Their songwriting, arranging, and production continue to improve. A7X has really come into their own with the last few albums and they inhabit a spot in metal that distinguishes them from most other bands. While you can still hear their influences in their melodies, playing, songs, etc. they have combined all those elements into a cohesive sound that is truly unique among modern metal bands. I was drawn to A7X after seeing the LBC concert (mainly for Gates' playing) and although I wouldn't consider any single member my favorite at what they do, they are all solid at their jobs and the sum is actually greater than the parts in their case. I could give a s*** about whether they're considered pop metal or whether they're scorned by those in the \\"darker\\" metal genres. They write and play great music, that's all that matters to me.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game options available with new games being introduced.  This game keeps my attention.  I look forward to testing my skill and luck daily.<br />P
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is incredible for being a free app game. Its tons of fun & really good looking. This was a great idea for a game, I'm having a lot of fun playing this.
B00DURILJ2|5.0|I liked this movie.  The kid actors are really good especially Tye Sheridan (from 'Tree of Life').  The plot is kinda slow but unique.  I enjoyed the Arkansas river scenery and the side characters like Sam Shepard and Michael Shannon.  There's an almost film noir feel at times which works well to give a little edge but fortunately it doesn't go overboard into complete gritty darkness. I'm hoping to see Tye in some more good films soon.
B0060FXBNM|3.0|Currently in Production is TRANSFORMERS 4 expected to be released June 2014.<br />Why spend money buying the set when there is another one coming.<br />[...]
B007URVZJ6|4.0|It got me on the right track and it helped quite a bit. It was not a work of great literature but it was very very useful.
B005LAII8A|4.0|Looper was ok acting wise. The story is a bit like a dog chasing his tale or more like Pee Wee Herman's 'I know you are but what am I'. The screenwriter kind of had a grasp of the time continum theory, but Looper is why you should never meet yourself from another time. Things go ka-bloowy and it's Ground hog day all over again.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Amazing book and connectable characters I loved it! The book was funny and sad at times this is definitely one of my favorites
B00000DFSK|5.0|5 stars because this is a collectors CD of U2's original music that made them famous. It's a timeless work,of music....never grow weary of listening to it. There is an aspect to the music of U2 that is both most entertaining and haunting....haven't figured that out yet. I suspect it's an Irish thing. I'm Irish and lean towards Celtic music....but if and when you hear true Irish music you will well know it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|a treat to go back in time to a world I've never known... enjoy the scripting, actors are very good, and I especially like the clothes and jewelry
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|A very different approach to Bond, there should be more variety after all this time; I have been watching them since the 60s.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Best book I've read in years. I recommend it to anyone who is compassionately competitive. I just saw that there will be a movie, the book will be impossible to match.
B008BRC6NS|3.0|I expected this Cd to be great and I was sadly disappointed, I expected more Dance Music that would move me, Just didn't happen
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. An interesting way to present a story too. Nice characters that give the story warmth.
006224454X|5.0|Fantastic book. I didn't want to put it down. You don't know the ending until you are at the end. Book was very well written.
B007EC27QM|5.0|loaded  really fast and it did just what it was suppose to .i  would definitely buy again it is a great product
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This adaptor charges fast.  Works great. We are a multi-device family and it is always in use when we are in the car.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|My son says it's &#34;OK&#34; not horrible, but not great either. It seems that after this piece is built, there's not much to look forward to.
B001EN71CW|5.0|My husband had never seen the series & is a Sci-Fi fan. So I was happy to get the entire series on Blu-Ray & introduce him to it. Hate that it had such a short run. Like most really good Sci-Fi, it was ahead of it's time.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is awesome it has kept me entertained for hours the battles are a ton of fun and exciting the graphics are really good to<br />the online doesn't drop a lot of the online battles either
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Love that I now have the complete series & the movie. Great for stay in & watch all day occasion.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My Fire was dying from lack of space; this program cleared up over a GB of space for me. Fantastic.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Great case law, complex characters, very well written. Great to see the evolution of the characters from season 1 to season 3
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I heard Andrea Bocelli on a PBS station and really enjoyed the show. I purchased this CD because of the show I watched and absolutely love listening to it
B00275EHJG|5.0|Gread gift for a home of two kids between the ages of 7 and10 years old.  I recomend it for kids any age.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Lots of fun; challenging puzzles; lots of hidden objects and not so easy I got bored; really looking forward to the next in the series
B006LSZECO|2.0|I did not like this book.  It was evident to me from the middle of the book that the wife was guilty.  Like many others, I did not care for the ending and felt that author left it open ended for a sequel.  We read it for our book club and most of the members did not like it.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Kill Decision is a timely novel at the intersection of the &#34;thriller&#34; and &#34;sci-fi&#34; genres. Daniel Suarez worked with military theorist John Robb on the background of the book, and his treatment of interpersonal relations within a fire team is done well. (Since he started writing, portions of the book moved from near-future scifi to 'real life'.)<br /><br />Daniel Suarez gave a TED talk (or, possibly TEDx talk, not sure), and that was one of the things which persuaded me to buy it.
B004LWZW2E|3.0|Great for kids who want to be scared while watching a movie !!!  This was requested by a teenage grandchild and they loved it.  They are waiting for part 2 to come out this fall.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This is one of those movies that you just HAVE to buy for your kids.  Hard to find, because it was a re-release... but got it here & for a great price!
0316228532|2.0|My husband downloaded this book for me since I am a frequent traveler and thought it would be an \\"easy\\" read - meaning I wouldn't miss my flight because I got engrossed in the plot. All I can say is that I would have had to have read all 1000+ pages to get to the plot because this book is NOT a casual read. You have to really pay attention to the people and who belongs with whom or you will really lose the impact of the characters and their interaction.<br />I did not enjoy the book - the constant hopping from one situation to another, unfinished thoughts that took another chapter or two to find a conclusion was extremely frustrating.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Technically sound and revealing and especially the importance of the will to recover relative to the feelings of inner peace.
B008ZOHCKE|1.0|I truly loved this app until I updated it and now I've got ads taking up a chunk of space which only leaves a few lines visible when I'm typing with my Kindle's keyboard. I went back to the app store to look at it and they started charging$1.99 for which is why they had the update which adds the ads. You won't pay for it if there aren't any ads so inserting them makes people more willing to pay for the same product they had gotten for free. Sneaky and underhanded. I maintain a daily pain log with this app and I'm offended enough by the audacity of what they've done that I'm going to find a different app and pay for it instead of purchasing this one. I don't like being tricked!
B004TSXUWY|5.0|I loved the unpredictable part of the book - knowing And yet not knowing, feeling at the same time like the main character. I'm a huge fan of thriller stories and this one is now among my favourites!
B001N3UO7C|4.0|Interesting idea, good plot, sort of reminds me of that movie (Red October) with Sawn Connery where they had to drop Ryan in the sea to get picked up by a submarine and then board the Russian sub,it's like that kind of movie only in the air.  The bomb device was pretty cleaver and as a matter of fact the whole playing out of the story is very good, I wish their salute to Russell in the end was a little more respectful and snappy, but hey the writers were probably never in the military.  If they could have left off all the unnecessary swearing or a good deal of it which served little purpose in telling the story I'd have liked it better, because of the action and suspense.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Yea, I just bought this P.O.S on Saturday and the freggin thing doesn't work as fluidly as it sounds. Through my Ipod/Ipad/Laptop/iphone it takes forever to connect to the TV and I have Time Warner Turbo Internet package so it's not my internet speed.  Once it does finally connect the streaming looks horrible \\"this is viewing Netflix\\" and the other times the sound doesn't work.<br /><br />It gets better, you use your phone or ipad as a remote that has a 30sec lag time or more to the TV.  SO basically, you sit around watching a loading screen for most of your day.  If it does start working properly don't touch anything or you'll start this crappy process all over again.<br /><br />Needles to say I'm returning it today.
B008Y78M60|1.0|I was all set to enjoy this historical drama, but there were no subtitles!  I am very hearing impaired and even though I wear expensive hearing aids, I still need subtitles to catch everything said.  I can't believe that Amazon would discriminate against the hearing impaired people in the world.  When will you start allowing the subtitles to be displayed.  I know that this movie has them as the movie industry does not discriminate against hearing impaired people.  PLEASE GET SUBTITLES FOR YOUR MOVIES!!!!!!!!
B009IF6U98|5.0|Great cast.  If you love Caddyshack, Happy Gilmore, Animal House, Anchorman, and movies like that, then you'll love this one.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Much like Pringles, one you start you can't stop. I love this game, and I can not stop. Get this game and let'er rip!!!
B005BZQVJ8|3.0|Has its cute moments and some clever humor, was entertaining. Not a knee slapper. If I had it to do over, I'd catch it on Prime Video for free if it ever gets there.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Incredible movie. I could not find it in any store, only online. It was every bit as much fun as I remembered it being.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|We kept our old digital camera, and XD memory is no longer available in stores, so we are glad to find it here.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was a present for my daughter she is addicted to minecraft. Shipping was fast and she was thrilled to get it on her birthday
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I like science fiction movies so this falls into that category. It could have shown more about earth but the movie is already over two hours long.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I elected to make this my first purchase for my new Kindle.  I have played it &#34;forever&#34; on my computer and thought that it would be a good choice as I become accoustomed to my Kindle.  I was right!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What a great read! I couldn't put it down.  Marcus` memoirs prove that good can be found in the most unlikely situations.
0374533555|5.0|This is a great book by Prof. Kahneman. It's very insightful and thorough and since the book is a thick one, I'm still in the process of reading through it. It has made me re-think the way I think about things and not to jump onto the obvious but to look deeper into thinks like the example of the cost of a bat and ball.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|It is easy to use and does what it is supposed to. you don't need Wi-Fi to use it and you can save what you need to and has a text format so you can use it to writ short stories or whatever you want. Great!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I saw this app soon after getting my Kindle Fire, but I steered clear despite the rave reviews.  But I finally bit the bullet and bought it, and despite the fact that your ultimate goal is to wipe out humanity, this little devil is a blast.<br /><br />You start out with just one type, bacteria, for you to unleash on the unsuspecting masses.  But there are TONS of options on how this disease is transmitted, its various symptoms (from pedestrian to corpse-creating), and its abilities to adapt to its environs.  Plus there are some fun achievements you can earn along the way by combining two or more symptoms.<br /><br />The map is laid out well, and you watch as planes and ships scoot from port to port, taking sadistic delight in watching red ones (infected) head for an otherwise healthy green landmass.  I know I should feel bad about killing BILLIONS of people, but these guys made it just too dang fun!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Good!  Very helpful.  It's good because when I'm shopping, it helps me calculate up my groceries.  Also good for balancing your checkbook.
B001S86J0I|5.0|This movie hit home on many levels. If you've ever attended a science fiction convention or just like science fiction this will appeal to you.<br />I thought the movie was so well done; the acting was just right, no too over the top, the characters are lovable, the special effects don't dominate the movie, and the story line was very entertaining.<br />This movie is one of the best sci-fi comedies I have ever seen and I highly recommend it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Missle Defender is a blast to play. Very nice pick up and go game. The upgrade system added a nice element to keep play interesting.
B00821OX98|5.0|this show is a lot more intellectual than I was expecting. The main character was a history professor that loved military history. In the show shows that understanding history can help inform our decisions today. But he also is a realist and more than happy to pick up whatever gun is available to take care of business.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|Well ELIAS DOES IT AGAIN FOR ME A OLD JAZZ NUT.The women puts out the best jazz songs an her piano playing might<br />just be the best out there for women or men in piano artist. she is fantastic in her cord work an her take on &#34;I Thought About You&#34; by Chet Baker was just out of sight. I hope I can live long enough to see this great lady lay live. thanks Eliane Elias<br />TW REED<br /><br />Baker 'is out of site.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Very easy to install and easy to use.  My son loves taking a bike ride and I love being able to see him and talk to him while riding.  Works prefectly.  I would highly recommend.  It does take a little getting used to with him right in front of me because you have to pedal slightly to the side, but it gets easier as you go.
B00ABLJ5NQ|1.0|I see that this author has written several books but this is the only one that I will read. The whole thing was a confused mishmash of hallucinations. Frankly, I've had better nightmares. Absolute rubbish
B00DURILJ2|4.0|I thought the movie was very good and the acting very good too.  I would recommend this movie to my family and friends.
B00E7PQVHK|5.0|Love the game overall i usually play rpgs but this one caught me by surprise. I also took the risk of buying it on my kindle fire hd and it worked.
1616550414|5.0|The quality of bookbinding and the pages of the book are excellent. The illustrations are beautiful. Much information about the sagas of The Legend of Zelda and beautiful sketches of the development of characters make for a true fan of this series of games of Shigeru Miyamoto, this book is a must have in your collection.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I Love draw something especially because it's FREE:)  PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DRAW WITH ME AT LiZzYbEe15. :) have fun
B006XF5BTG|4.0|The information is very simple but makes a lot of sense. I just started the program and<br /> looking forward to seeing what kind of results I get.
B007AL48UK|5.0|This is the must have game of the summer. I love this game, it helps strengthen your eye coordination with speed and efficency. Love it!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Buying tokens suck, but u do get at least 2 free tokens every 45 min. Otherwise good multi online game for kindle fire users
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|It wasn't what I expected but I had a hard time putting it down. Possible fiction? It was so good and was a good read.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I am another not happy cusotmer with the Chrome Tab casting. I never saw anything anywhere about it being Beta. That was really the main reason I bought it. I have an I5, 8GB ram and my network is up to date using a Cisco N Router. I guess I should try a hard connection to see what it does but from the other users doesn't fix a thing. Maybe a hard connection to the Chromecast device would be nice to have as an option. That would solve it I am sure but then I would be investing in a competitor's device I would assume.<br /><br />I did not give it more stars as I haven't tried it with Netflix. I did try Youtube I thought and it didn't seem to work well there if I remember right.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|It is so fun I love it I could play it all day but on a rainey day I would.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is cool.....it was a great distraction from the storm outside...kept me busy from the ugly weather... storyline could be better.. but i like hidden object games...hope for more good ones soon so i can keep busy from cleaning all day orr not my home would be a mess
B0091QS88K|5.0|This game is good for 10_6 years old plus,it has more dr.panda games for kids and it might inspire kids to think about being a owner of a restaurant and a plane flyer.  Look at dr.pandas other games plus dr.pandas airport,<br /><br />Jade
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|With this movie I got all the explosions, chases and chaos I expected.  With a 5.1 system I got the workout it deserved.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|What more is there to say that hasn't already been said?  This movie comes very close to perfection for me ...
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I appreciate that Aslan, unlike so many other authors on the subject, avoids becoming dogmatic but rather simply presents the results, as he sees them, of his research. Do not skip his notes at the end. They are the icing on the cake. Interestingly enough, this book left me with a greater appreciation for the fact that the Jesus that we all learned about was likely a more dynamic and interesting than I ever imagined. I was also surprised by the direction Aslan takes regarding the question that Jesus is actually an historical figure. No matter where you stand on this subject, I think you will learn something from this comfortable read.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Did not even finish reading it.  If it got better I'll never know but that's ok as I have another 100 or so to read on my Kindle.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It looks like everyone who works in Pearson Hardman is a character (in the USA network sense).  I love everything about the show.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Great  expansion to the Star Trek Saga!  Although the story line is different from the original series it still follows along with some of the story in its own way. While some of the die hard Trekies will denounce it for being to action oriented I would like to think that if Gene Rodenberry had the ability to make his tv shows and movies this believable with the action I think he would have. Regardless of action they still have the underlying message Gene wanted to convey, however subtle it is since this is based off his world.  Hopefully this will allow for a new and younger generation of Star Trek lovers.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Rowling spent too much time building/describing/listing features of characters that were neither interesting nor important to the plot.<br />Her wonderful details of each creature in the Henry Potters series were required because those were made up beings.  Casual Vacancy folks are just the boring people next door.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Lots of bang, bang shoot 'em up, but very little plot. Was fun to see Bruce's movie son and how well they ultimately played together, but not the best of this bunch...
B0045LSIRM|5.0|Great álbum. Back to the roots and before duets with a Spice Girl. It's Only Love is outstanding. Some songs just don't fit.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|the kids were really good, believable,<br />and MUD was awesome.<br />Loved this movie, and the ending was exceptional.<br />No disappointment here.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|So, I would naturally love any album of his. I appreciated being able to download the music even before receiving the actual CD.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|I thought this was a good movie, although I'm certainly not a very hard critic. It was an interesting twist from the Disney classic. A very dark version of the story, but I was not disappointed.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I've listened to a7x for a longtime.  I like any and everything they've put out.  This is different but just like other reviews put it, Hail To The King has an 80s Black Album feel to it.  I love it and reccomend it if you loved Black Album and other 80s Metal this is a must.
0525478817|5.0|My 12 and 14 year olds have read this and loved it. I want to read it next since they had good things to say about it. My 12 year old son liked reading about how the character handled a difficult situation. He found it interesting and a good read. Didn't take him long to finish and he would recommend it to others as a great book. Worth the purchase for sure if two of my kids gave it high ratings.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|8 Instantly classic metal epics on the first disc; 2 out of 3 songs on the bonus disc are excellent as well (the second bonus song feels \\"unfinished\\"). I havn't taken this cd out of my changer since it came out! The sixth greatest metal album ever (behind Black Sabbath's first 5 albums)!
0525478817|5.0|This is my all time favorite book ever. EVER. I cried, I laughed, I cried again. It's seriously the best book. Its definitely a reread for sure.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Iots of action, Thin on plot. Typical John McClain. Good guys win .  Men will like it. Go for it.
B005EGXNLS|3.0|This book in the series is a good read, although I will say its seems like he really just repeats himself way to much.  The stories seem to have been written so they could stand alone if a reader hadn't read any of the other books in the series, which honestly annoys me a bit.  If its meant to be a series I would think most avid readers will start at the beginning.  Still a good author and I would still read the next book regardless.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|Average game .the tutorial is the best part . There is no campaign mode and when you finish a match everything you do for your hero is lost and must be done again . you can buy other heroes for 100+coins and get maybe 20 per match which has no time limit
B00CAJMGDI|4.0|Very much like the Piano Guys. It is fun elegance and very nice to listen to, will appeal to many music listeners.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Watching this movie when I was young is why I'm a sci-fi fan. If you like Star Trek or Star Wars you'll love it
0743270754|5.0|This book can be summarized in one word. WOW!<br />For those that want a three book trilogy that proved a near complete understanding of the causes of the Civil War and the slavery issue this book coupled with Thomas Fleming's A Disease in the Public Mind and  Jon Meacham's Thomas Jefferson:  The Art of Power give an outstanding insight into the formation of American and the original cancer of slavery. More importantly, the unique pivotal factor of self rule by the people is elucidated in these books.<br />This book is long but I could not put it down and regret I am nearing the end.<br />Jimbo
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Seems like a well engineered product, I don't like the size compared to the one we have that also charges higher draw devices, but that one only does one device at a time.  This one does two at a time with no problem, although I have not tried two iPads at a time yet.
B008578PMU|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, and would recommend for anybody that enjoys a good war movie.  Good set of actors too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. Really have to use your brain.  Each level gets more challenging and makes you work a little harder.  Anyone would love this game if you like to work out puzzles.
B00CUWKHVI|4.0|This one was very good, almost as good as Pursuit! Find Jamie Cullum very  relaxing. Would recommend both of these albums.
B006T5FDLG|4.0|After the 'Black Album', I just written Metallica off. With 'Load\\" and 'Re-Load', S&M and whatever else came after that I was done with. Even the movies explaining the reasons for the musical directions did not appease me. I moved on from them and stuck with Overkill, Anthrax, Kreator, and the bands that kept Thrash alive. By chance, I was in Vintage Vinyl in Fords, NJ (my old neighborhood. Support your local record stores because going to a store and sampling music is MUCH MORE FUN than buying it online) and 'Hate Train' was playing, recognized the voice of Hetfield and had to pick this up. Crunchy, rough edged, and no 'Lite-FM, eMpTV' music here. AND NO VIOLINS, TUBAS, CELLOS included. I vowed to never support Metallica again after being Hoodwinked into believing that 'St. Anger' had a 'Messhugah feel to it' as one music critic described the music. I feel that they are returning CLOSE to where they began... As one of the pillars of thrash. I pray that this is just a pre-cursor to what is in works at the Metallica camp. And, in my own opinion... Lars needs to pick it up! He can do MUCH better than what he has displayed. Or... Maybe they can hire Dave Lombardo for studio sessions. Look what Lombardo did on 'The Gathering' for Testament.<br />I LIKE 'Beyond Magnetic'. ALOT!<br />Just my opinion.
B00CHRBAEO|3.0|This is a review of the new Deluxe remastered CD, Brothers and Sisters, by the Allman Brothers Band. The band had just lost Barry Oakley, who does play on the first two tracks, \\"Wasted Words\\" and \\"Ramblin' Man\\". This is a CD that starts a change in the style of this group of brothers, with the addition of Chuck Leavell and Lamar Williams who add a bit of a jazz influence to the southern rock sound, plus Dicky Betts big hit \\"Ramblin' Man\\" which is a country sounding influence. Leavell on piano takes the place of another lead guitar and can he play.<br />  This is a great album, I remember buying it in 1973 and it sounded great on my stereo. I had never had this recording on CD. I bought the new Deluxe remastered version, which just came out. After I listened to it ,I was happy to have it, hearing the songs, but it sounded a bit thin without a lot of bottom end. It was mastered by Seth Foster at Sterling Sound in New York City. I found an older Capricorn version, picked it out of the 4.50 bin ,later that day, I threw it in my stereo and bam, it sounded just like what I remembered, Dickey Betts' vocals were louder in the mix, it just opened up, like the new version feels like there is a blanket over my speakers, even though it is louder. The older CD was mastered by Suhr Gur @ Polygram Records.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is Awesome Awesome awesome this app is great this app is good I'm doing this so I can get more coins. There is a twenty word limit.
B00BF124PC|5.0|This is a long movie but if your interested in some of the history of the long march to the ultimate death of Bin Laden you won't be disappointed.  While some of the interrogations shown it is were controversial when it was released they are not what you might think of when somebody says torture. I would say the things pictured are very mild compared to what they could be, and since those who would have been tortured are not US citizens they deserve no such privileges as are afford to actual citizens of this great nation.  Enough of my political rant.........I did enjoy the back story although I don't know if any of the CIA agents stories are actually true. I definitely recommend this movie!
B004HW7JI8|5.0|This season kept me on my toes, wondering who and what was going to happen. Lots of twists and I felt the plot just kept getting better!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you like dogs, this is as good as it gets! A must read for all! And it's not about racing.
B009AY04A8|3.0|This game is a decent time waster, but it ends on a cliffhanger and it's a little overzealous with time penalties. The dialogue is cheesy and makes you wonder why they bother trying to have a storyline when they clearly don't take it seriously except as a poor device to try to get another purchase.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this show. It didn't take me long at all to be hooked. I look forward to the next season.
B00ADS90EQ|4.0|This movie has quickly become one of my faves. It's funny, has a little romance and most importantly, lots of fantastic musical performances! The mash-ups are awesome.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|I was never into the whole Marvel Comic thing, but I took a chance at watching this movie for the simple fact that I was bored and it was offered free with prime.  I enjoyed the Iron Man movies and Thor, I hated the Hulk movies but with them all together it made for an interesting story that is out of the norm from most main stream movies. Give it a shot there are definitely worse movies.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|The author really portrays Christopher in the story through his word choice. This allows you to better understand and feel empathy towards him. I loved the book.
B000002L68|4.0|Had problem with a DVD but it was swiftly addressed by customer support.  I am very satisfied with the resolution.
B004Q0SQ24|5.0|My 22 month is in love with chuggington and when he say these he got so excited. They are great for him!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was this is helpful and good for finding words u need I love it helps allot for me good
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Somewhat of a mix between Harry Potter and Twilight, this book grabs you from the first couple of pages. I was so hooked<br /> I could barely put it down to go to work!
B009SQQRH2|4.0|This was a good movie, funny and a great xmas themed movie, it kept me interested so I'm sure it would do the same for children of any age.
B002KKCVQE|5.0|I'm satisfied of my purchase. The sandals fulfill my expectations and the ordinary delivery has been very quick, but considering the taxes and the expenses for the expedition I've payed the same amount that I could have payed for the purchase in a shop in my home town (Pisa, Italy). I use my very confortable sandals every day, at work or for hiking, from March to November. I wash the sandals every evening and the morning are dry and clean.
B004IPPINW|5.0|Totally enjoyed the book and it was a real thought provoker.  I am anxious to read another book by this author.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this app kept me entertained for an hour then it ended but enjoyed it. needs more lvls soon and more puzzles.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It's 5 stars even though Russell Crowe butchered the song &#34;Stars&#34; and generally played the part of Javert in a way that said he was there for a paycheck and exactly nothing else. Amanda Seyfried could have invested a bit more, too.<br /><br />However... the entire rest of the cast more than makes up for it and carries this entire movie. They have changed the order of some of the songs, changed some of the words, omitted bits and written a new song. All of these changes made sense to me and helped the movie flow better.<br /><br />This is my favorite Broadway show of all time. I have seen it on stage at least 4 times and can't wait to go back. I'm glad to have this movie to get me through the &#34;in between stage shows&#34; times! Yep, I am a theater dork. And proud of it.
B00BESM14U|1.0|This movie was heavy on drug use, drinking, teen sex (including homosexuality).  If this is what high school is like now, I'm glad I'm done!  The story line was very much clouded by immoral behavior.
B001HTSCZI|4.0|Good movie that shows more of the Clone Wars, I only wish they had show more with the other movies, the TV series is also very enjoyable and action packed.
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|Good movie.  But, really?  don't we all have our own challenges in life?  Oh yeah...I was 40 twenty years ago.
B00CCX9DUG|4.0|Phillipa knows how to tell a story.... A real page turner.... Based on history but a spin of her own, I felt as if I had come to know Elizabeth of York as a person and not just a name
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Well written interesting novel, with great characters. Somewhat hard to keep the characters straight, but worth the effort. If you do.
B003Z0BWT0|4.0|Couldn't put it down.  Great as usual, cant wait to start the next book, they are so captivating they keep you intrigued
B00015YVD6|5.0|My 9 year old granddaughter wanted me to record this on tv.  Searched for months but it never came on for me to record it. Found this on Amazon and she was so excited when it came in.  She watches it over and over.  Love it
B008EQIK90|4.0|This is a good comedy movie, kept me laughing and interested the whole time.  I would recommend it to others.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was an unexpected find for me. I usually ignore Amazon's suggestions, but this one intrigued me enough to read some of the reviews, and that sold me. Once I started reading, I was completely engrossed in the lives of these three women and the secrets they kept. It reminded me very much of an Anne Tyler book, which, in my opinion, is the highest praise. We get to know these women and their internal struggles through Ms. Moriarty's deft, delicate storytelling, and every chapter brings new and intriguing revelations. Without giving away any of the many secrets, I'll say that as a reader, we're led along a delicate path of internal struggles, lies and value judgments and brought, finally, to what I think is a very satisfying ending. Many of the twists and turns of the novel are unexpected, and Ms. Moriarty's tender feelings for all of her characters is clear. She's definitely got a new fan in this American man. I'm downloading her other titles to my Kindle and awaiting more from this wonderful find.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I cannot recommend this book enough. Chris Kyle's stories of patriotism are amazing. The book also made the war easier to understand.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Very interesting and entertaining. Gets a little gory at times but its the real life of those times. Matches history in content very well.
B005LAIISA|5.0|My six-year-old grandson asked me for this movie for his birthday.  It is well worth the money and your children will want to watch it over and over again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is such a fantastic show.  I never watched it but this summer I decided to give it a shot and I became addicted.  I binge watched episodes until finished season 3...and now waiting for January 2014...sigh.  That being said, it seems the writers can't stand any happiness in this family.  Now I think that when I see something going well I should expect that person to be killed off (boo!).
B009K72G8I|5.0|I love this TV series, and hope they make many more Star Wars TV shows.  All of the seasons are action packed with many side stories that I enjoyed.
0061950726|5.0|This book was facinating, but I keep wishing it wasn't true or even based on truth! Loved how it went back in time and<br />then up to current days with an old lady & a young girl who could share their difficult lives with each other.<br />Great book!
0316056898|5.0|My wife loved it... she laughted a lot and read it very very fast...probably one of the most likeable gifts I have given to her
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This is a great game of simple but effective strategy.  I did figure out that the more you redo your solution the lower the score will be. Got to get it the first time out!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game to play. Keeps you busy and it gives your mind a good work out .
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked this game ok, but I am anxious to get more levels to play.  I love hidden object games and this game was fun to try to find items needed to escape.  I would recommend this game.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|After reading the book I was determined to watch the movie.  This is a fantastic movie and it easily held up to my high expectations.  I fell in love with the characters and I am about to watch it for the fourth time since buying it.  I love, love, love this movie.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Really Like The Game A Lot.<br />You Have A Lot Of Fun.The Only That Upset Me Is That They Cheat You Out Of Your Credits.They Only Allow You To Only 5 Credits At One Time Wish They Would Let You Get All That Is Gifted To At One Time.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|can not cast chrome tabs from Tablet!<br /><br />Works well but not enough usability yet.  Holds wifi great, will be a nice unit once someone writes apps fro web browsing, pandora, and local media
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I won't put any &#34;spoilers&#34; out there but this was a fantastic season and I can't wait for Season 4!  You will love it!  My grandparents are from Staffordshire, England so I have always enjoyed English television.  This series is WONDERFUL!

B009AY04A8|3.0|Only in as far as chapter 3, but it's been fun enough so far to hook my interest. Pretty good story line, although the first person character is awfully polite for a pirate. A little too polite.
B00BHXUC4S|5.0|jeff lynne is a true treasure, this is a must have especially if u r a elo fan  or a fan of music in general
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|The dvd I was sent was from America so I cannot play it on my dvd player. Even though The address was for Australia why was I sent an Amer<br />ican region DVD, surely someone should have realised this..<br />  Chris Grindle [ Disgruntled eagles Fan]
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|A great book and fun read.  I like her writing style.  Wish Amazon didn't have to refer to it as Oprah's Book Club edition but whatever.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The continuing story of family in that long ago era is most interesting.  The writer brings you to many of the character's personal life and puts you deep into the story.  It is interesting to watch the characters show what was proper in those days and sometimes what was not acceptable as proper for the time.  The acting is high quality, the beauty of the area where it was filmed is superior.  I am always very anxious to see what the next segment has in store.  There are sad times, and there are happy times, which is just like real life.  It is most intertaining and well done.  Can't wait until Season 4.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I can not find fault. It works well, nice display. Gives me all the info I need. For the price, I would suggest this App to anyone. Thanx.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|Works good with iPhone, prints everything... emails and all. When it come to the Kindle, It will not and doesn't offer to print emails... too bad!
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I love jeff lynne cuz he a fab musicain  super music  if you like elo u will love his latest album
B009XIXVU6|4.0|He is a master at weaving tales that make me love his characters.  I hated to see the book end.
B00CEF014E|2.0|I'll give this novel two stars for good punctuation and grammar. Other than that, it's a mess. I was confused from the beginning. Dana is released from a mental hospital, pills in hand, somebody drives her to a hotel where she spends the night, and when she wakes up, she says her boyfriend is missing. Did I miss something? The boyfriend never made an appearance until his disappearance. Overall, confusing, irritating, and a waste.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Good, in depth gameplay, solid politics play and good development of the player options. Overall a truly solid game. Highly recommended.
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|The rigors that the author went through on his long walk out of Siberia and into India - this was tough, tough, tough beyond human endurance. The punishment Russians doled out to prisoners was unbelievable. How could some human beings treat fellow human beings so horribly?
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|usually not one of the first to download a new game. This one just caught my eye. Glad I. did wonderful movement between levels. Cute characters ...would've liked more levels already done :(.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|&#34;BLA BLA BLA&#34;....I don't talk like that&#34; _Count<br /><br />very good movie,  family Loves It!!<br />great for popcorn and laughter. yep
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Didn't expect much more then that.. I think the special affects were well done and acting was not Oscar worthy but again it was entertaining.
1616960922|5.0|I loved it one of his better books just a little short. I found it imediately captivating im currently reading the Mistborn Trilogy.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The Piano Guys are the greatest.  I love to listen to their music.  Waiting for more albums to come out so I can purchase them.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|The movie was good but slow.  If your looking for a good mystery that's not hair raising, edge of your chair you would like this movie.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this is so dumb!! I cant even install it for some reason! I all ready paid my 7.99 for it and now I cant install it?!  RIPOFF
B007SGM084|2.0|This to me was real garbage with sort of an interesting plot.  Hope I never run into any real characters that were portrayed.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I am a Sophie Kinsella fan and am intrigued by her plot twists, modern applications and exact research.  I didn't feel this was her best book, but it is still a lot of fun to read.
0307352153|1.0|That was rather boring and repetitious.  I was a little offended that the author took liberties classifying and dissecting notable persons, especially those no longer around to defend themselves.  I thought it was arrogant of the author to judge and &#34;box up&#34; their personalities.  On the plus side this book generated close to 1500 reviews which tells me that the subject demands discussion.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I never used this app, so I really cannot say anything good or bad about it.  That is why I gave it 3 stars.
B008Q00KEW|5.0|Star treks are always good. Lots of excitement as always and some real surprises.  Totally recommend you watch this movie.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|The dictionary that came loaded onto my kindle was not self explanatory.  I know , who doesn't khow how to use a dictionary.<br />This one showed icons that made it so much easier to find the word I was searching.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|It would be nice to try it. Perhaps it will be made easier to download. Will wait to see if it happens.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I reviewed this because my old charger was no longer charging my kindle like it was supposed to. I received this along with the adapter and I love it. It's long enough so I can plug it in and still sit on my couch and read. It's so fast which is the best part. Plug it in before dinner by the time I'm done its ready for me to sit and read for the night!!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|With all of the no-talent clowns putting out consistent garbage infecting our radios, cd players and ipods; its nice to see Dave Grohl showing what real talented people can do.  Thanks Dave for making this outstanding documentary.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I am not a Facebook person, so I cannot really rate this app as good or bad which is why I am giving it 3 stars.
B004K58GSO|5.0|It was great to see this classic in HD.  I recommend all John Wayne movies and this is no exception and youcamtbeat the cast.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|By far, this is the best of the angry birds series. I cant wait until Angry Birds Star Wars II comes out!!!!!!!!!!
B00BESM14U|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've seen in some time. Arguably timeless piece about finding one's identity. Great flick.
9056912445|5.0|I have read Silmans Complete Endgame Course and love it.  Devortsky's Endgame Manual is also excellent, but for higher rated players.<br />100 Endgames You Must Know is also almost right there with Silmans book.  While Silmans book is bigger, and covers more, This book would make a very good first end game book.  You will learn from it, and learn well.<br />Highly recommended
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|I know that many people will feel differently about this movie than I did, but the problem with the movie is more the direction and the fact that the movie seemed unfinished.  Kirk & the villain (spoilers....) were friends until the one man turns against him.  Star Trek II was a much better film but it was a continuation of the story from the TV show where you were introduced to who became the villain in that film.  It was actually a really good episode even when viewed today.  I didn't get much of a surprise with the twist in the middle and even some of the references that JJ tried to show us were understood but underdeveloped.  (Carol Marcus was a good example).<br /><br />A few problems I had:<br /><br />I did find it interesting that *no one* tried to stop a space ship flying into downtown San Francisco...<br />Carol Marcus?  Why add her when her contribution seemed like something Megan Fox could do.<br />The conflict and fight between the villain and Kirk was really short and really dull.  Watch Star Trek II to understand why it falls on its face (there was an edge-of-your-seat feeling when they were in the nebula -- not too much suspense here).<br /><br />Still, compared to Star Trek 5 and Star Trek 3, it was a good movie.  I just felt like it was unfinished or rushed.  It could've been better.... much better.  But it wasn't nearly as bad as it could've been.<br /><br />Lauren
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I enjoy the quick reactions and visual acuity it can take to play this game.  If you like looking for groups and patterns of colors then you will enjoy this game.
B00DGN51O8|1.0|Well I'm sorry but this was the dumbest movie next to Caveman I've ever seen.  My husbands choice of course!  So if you have someone that loves really stupid movies, they'll love this one.  Ugh!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is a great product. We have both an android phone and IPads. To be able to charge both with one devise is very convenient. I recommend this product highly.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|All the stuff I learned in seminary but was warned against using. &#34;You'll never sell this on a Sunday morning!!&#34; Well, I *have* used it over the years, but now having it in a well-reviewed book is so much better. Reza Aslan has done a marvelous job of framing the times and personalities that are otherwise interpreted according to individual agendas. Excellent resource.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I love scifi and Tom Cruise, with whom I believe is a wonderful actor in anything he does. I just wish people would see the person and not the religion he lives by. I am a Christian and we are not to judge people rudely or fausely.<br />The movie I felt was slow moving, but still a wonder to watch. I will watch this movie for many years to come.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This was entertaining. I liked the interpretation of the classic &#34;fairy tale.&#34; The special effects were great, it might be a little bloody for younger kids. The giants eat some of the people and it's a little graphic. The ending is predictable but that's really what you want - to feel good at the end. I liked it and would watch it again.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Of course Angry Birds was the very first app I downloaded onto my Kindle, because that's what everyone does, right?  I honestly do not remember what Angry Birds Seasons was even about.  I probably played a few levels and got tired of it which is why I removed the app.
B003U4ZQUM|3.0|LOST has good production values and easy on the eyes.<br />With so many episodes, it's no wonder that the writers are having to really stretch to come up with anything.<br />It bounces back and forth between plausible and SCIFI.<br />I'm not sure you can find even a lesson any more.
0684857219|5.0|I am super excited to dive into this book and apply some of its teachings!  Buff Body here I come ;)
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|slow to get going. The ending helped make up for things but it was a snoozer. Cruise is a formula actor.
0788859544|5.0|What can I say? This is an all time classic that will be around for years to come. I bought this for my grandchildren as they loved watching mine. I wish they would have kept up the story. Maybe one day they will.
B009WUBERW|2.0|These actors aren't know for their great acting skills so what did I expect? They tried to be funny and I'm sure the catch phrases were created so we'd all be repeating them for years to come. Not. Lots of shooting and fighting - makes me tired just watching it. There was a story in it somewhere... I'm sure of it.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Since I am a huge fan of Super Mario (being that was the only video game I was allowed to play growing up), I quickly got hooked on this game and could not stop playing until I beat the whole thing.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I watched this under duress at my brothers house  --I am not a fan of TC  --  This movie was long boring confusing at times ---  we start off in one direction and then had off into another --  The only thing I liked was the scenery and I could have watched that for two hours  --
0062255657|2.0|I will freely admit that I don't read as voraciously as most of the reviewers. I get too easily distracted by repetitive uses of words and turns of phrases. In this book it was the word 'clambered', second was that such and such a thing 'smelled of' something; usually something it should obviously smell of plus one other (wee!) unexpected thing. Anyway, such distractions stick out like sore thumbs and keep me from enjoying a book, even if I typically like the writing style.<br /><br />That being said, I've never picked up a Neil Gaiman anything. Not even once. I've heard of him through his association with Tori Amos, but that's the extent of it. I happened to see a novel by him while I was shopping a couple of nights ago. It piqued my interest. I picked it up and found the scene where his father tries to drown him. I made that face, you know - the 'not bad' face? So I flipped to another random page and found something else that seemed well-written. I decided to give it a go.<br /><br />I WISH I had flipped to a page of the mumbo-jumbo jibber-jabber that the Hempstock ladies were always spouting off, about returning Ursula to her home. I guarantee you I would NOT have bought the book.<br /><br />I don't mind a bit of fantasy as long as it is explained with some effort. And it never was. It was just WORDS and HINTS about some strange otherworldly place. It never went anywhere.<br /><br />Throughout my reading, I kept trying to imagine if this was a movie, would I walk out feeling like I'd seen something significant or enchanting, at the very least? Having finished the book, the answer is NO. I am pretty sure I'd just be kind of annoyed. I'm not that annoyed by the book, it wasn't that long. I do like his writing style, but the story was NOT polished or even well-resolved. Just meh.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Runs great on my galaxy S4. Addicting game. Easy to play. Loads fast when you only have a minute to play
B0072OFM28|5.0|Loved the character portrayals. The relevant historical aspects were good. And the special effects were immensely entertaining.<br />Loved that all the baddies got their just desserts. Carry on, Spartacus. Take no prisoners. And hope you find another hot woman!
B000JGWDU0|1.0|I know a lot of people rave about this book, including my best friend. I bought it because she recommended it, but I found it to be very boring and nothing new. Don't waste your time or money- my opinion.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Good dictionary, but I have had trouble trying to find words I need quickly (like when you are trying to convince your family that a word is indeed in the dictionary in a game of Scrabble).  :-)
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This film is beautiful --  Just an amazing film --  You have to see it to get the great beauty of the film --  I read the book and this does it justice  --  It is smart  -  provocative and thoughtful  ---  just get some popcorn and enjoy  - a feast for your heart and spirit --
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It has a big interface, super easy to use, AND keeps track! Great for number crunching; especially when you can't find the little calculator. You know you can always find your Kindle!
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I have loved Suits since first finding it in the first season.  I love the quick repartee and as a seamstress I love the high style fashion of the women on the show.  Anyone who loved West Wing and misses that kind of quick back and forth will love Suits although Season 2 & now 3 have been a bit tiring in all the hatred and bickering that continues.  I wish the writers would go back to the original story and stop all the squabbling.<br /><br />I intend to purchase Season 3 when it becomes available but haven't decided about season 2 yet.  Don't need that kind of arguing in my entertainment.  I also didn't like that they killed off the grandma.  She had the most sanity in the show.  Excellent Flashbacks this season and hopefully they will get past the bickering and move on to some cases that don't take an entire season to solve. Could be a little more like GOOD WIFE in that aspect,
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works good on Samsung Axiom.  No problems so far. Bookmarking is great and a lot of book choices.  A lot of free books also.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I am a big fan of Gaiman's works, and this one doesn't disappoint.  I laughed, I cried, I cringed, cheered, and read it over again a 2nd time as soon as I finished!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love using my NOTE app to make lists of things I need to do.  It comes in very handy when planning for trips.
B008OOYALE|4.0|very addictive game. only down side is that it freezes at least once a day, would love an update to fix that.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I had never watched Castle regularly as it was broadcast.  I came into it late and had a little trouble catching on.  So when Castle seasons became available on Amazon instant videos, I started with the very beginning.  I have been watching the episodes in chronological order and find it thoroughly delightful.  Yes, someone always gets killed, but the search for the perpetrator is always quite intreguieing and the victim is never a person they allow the viewer to become attached to.  There is always just a hint of romance on the side, and the character, Rick Castle, is multideminsional.  He has quite a dry sense of humor with intelligence and warmth mixed in.  I am really enjoying it.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|This is a really nice surprise.  When it arrived, it came in a nice large box.  I don't buy many watches.  I have a few expensive watches, but this is just as nice, for a tiny fraction of what you would pay for a high end watch.
1590171993|5.0|This fine novel is heartbreaking and has a quiet, unrelenting determination that kept me excitedly and anxiously reading. Beautifully structured and a wonderful reflection of 20th Century groping for self realization. This book is a true American classic and needs to be read by many, many more people.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Another amazing season! Just make sure to start form the first season. I can't believe there's only one season left
B005544TRQ|3.0|Amazon Instant has problems streaming in HD. This is not a network issue as all my other vendors stream HD without constantly buffering and needing a restart. Amazon needs to put more capabilities into its streaming service.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|Just wanted to get a different aspect of the book since reading the book when in high school. It was great re- reading
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Thanks again. The new SUB cord eliminated all the problems I was having with my Kindle. It recharges the battery so much faster
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Nice to see Arnold back in the action again; nostalgic to see him again; also a few of my favorite character actors.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This Is The First Game Of Its Type Ive played Before But It Was Really Fun Would Recommend It To Anyone
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I don't usually read YA but something about OUTVIEW drew my attention. It has an original plot that has been expertly woven. Strewn with spiritual and fantasy elements, entwined into a contemporary setting and populated with well drawn characters. OUTVIEW is an engrossing read which I would recommend to anyone, whether a YA fan or not.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Easy to watch and just as easy to hope LL2 would come soon.  I might read the book if it is ever written.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Definitely reminiscent of Tolkien, with interweaving stories and depth of history. Loved it, and couldn't put it down. Cannot wait to read the rest of the series, and also watch the HBO show.

1476733953|3.0|I had been excited to read Wool for quite some time, due to the fact that it was self-published and had been getting a lot of hype. Unfortunately, I found the story very hard to get in to. The highlight for me was the opening part, which was the original short story that the rest of the book was based on. This part was great, and I tore through it very quickly. After that though, I felt as if everything went down hill. The second part in particular seemed to stretch on for a long time, with very little development. The idea of the silos is a very interesting, and I loved the themes presented in the first part, but Howey took too long to develop them. I could tell that this book was written as separate short stories, so that kind of bothered me, because at times they felt disjunctive from the other parts. All in all, I was expecting better.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I won't go into the plot as others have covered that from all angles.<br /><br />My input may be a strange one to many, but here it is: the author obviously does not (doesn't!) like to use contractions.  ALL characters in the entire book might say (for example) \\"it did not occur to me\\" (instead of \\"it didn't occur to me\\")......or \\"I would not agree with that\\" (instead of \\"I wouldn't agree with that\\").  In other words, the dialogue is not how most people really speak when they're talking to each other.  Fine, if, say, the highly educated main character does not like to talk in contractions....but EVERYONE?  Mr. Landay obviously does not does not like to use colloquialisms in his dialogue, and his stylist preference was a noticeable distraction to me....it just didn't (!) seem real.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book when it first came out and have read this book at last 6 times. It still is my favourite science fiction  book of all time .
B009RX85N0|5.0|I love this show, so glad it came quickly. Packaging was good too. Can't wait for the 3rd season to come on tv, I'll be buying that as well for my collection.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This solitaire game works just like playing with a deck of cards. It does not have any quirks or problems.
0385736002|5.0|Awesome book.  I just finished it about a week ago.  Wasn't too sure about them (that's why I hadn't purchased them until now).  I'm pleased!
159514188X|3.0|I really wanted to like this book, because I thought the idea of it was very intriguing. Unfortunately, the story itself is anything but, as the two main characters, one who is dead, Hannah Baker, and one who is alive, Clay Jensen are largely forgettable. I did not really enjoy the format of the back and forth between the tapes and Clay's thoughts. Sometimes it worked, but often it made the book feel muddled together. The reasons for Hannah's suicide seemed trivial, especially towards the end. It was almost as if she was seeking out reasons to kill herself, which made me kind of angry. The idea for this book is a great one, and if Jay Asher would have developed deeper characters, I think it could have been stellar. In the end, almost everything about this novel falls short, making it a story I am likely not to remember.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love this game! Amazing graphics and fun to just watch as the dinosaurs grow. My nine year old gets a kick out of decoding the DNA and then getting surprised by the dinosaurs we get to hatch. Fun to figure out how many coins we need or how long it will take to hatch a new dino. The glacier park is pretty with the snow and is a nice change. Aquatic park is fun, but not as exciting as the other two parks in my opinion.  Hard to wait sometimes, but addictive as we try to collect as often as possible. No issues on my kindle fire.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game opened up with the intriguing scenes in the boy's family and then carried on with some excellent characterization in the Battle School. It amazed me how the author provided several years of info about the life in the Battle School and then on Eros in the Command School, keeping a moderate pace overall. And all this would have been great if the whole book had another premise other than the 'psychology of the chosen one', which is what the author wants to pass on to the reader, in my opinion.<br />How is a chosen one made a chosen one? Is he made or is he ready and then chosen? Does he know? Can he know? Can anyone know? What can people do around an individual that exhibits great promise and goes on to prove himself with every turn? Can they help him? Should they help him? Should they stand in his way?<br /><br />But nothing will prepare the reader for the ending. Orson Card changes gears after what would have been a great finalle for most authors, and drives us towards greatness. A great story. A truly great story.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|I did not expect to enjoy We Need To Talk About Kevin, but I did. In fact, I could not put it down.<br /><br />We Need To Talk About Kevin is the story of a 15yo (Kevin) who murders students and a teacher in a precision planner  attack at his high school. The story is told through letters from Kevin's mother to her husband (Kevin's father). We discover Kevin's crime early but the majority of the book deals with the years before, from before Kevin's birth, through his childhood, an  finally into the troubled days leading up to the attack.<br /><br />The novel raises some interesting questions. Are some people born bad? Are parents blind to their children's faults? Can you ever really forgive someone who has committed a terrible crime and stolen away people you know and love? I can't say I have all the answers, but I have enjoyed  thinking about them in recent days.<br /><br />This story with make you uncomfortable. It will make you angry, sad, frustrated, but most of all it will keep you fascinated.<br /><br />A great book stays with you long after you read the last page. This is one of those books.
0425263924|3.0|I read Bared...I read Reflected in You...by the time I got to this 3rd book, I was exhausted and annoyed with the back and forth between Eva and Gideon.  Mostly, I was annoyed with Eva's mom and her meddling and the \\"suspense\\" with Nathan's murder investigation.  I felt that dragged on throughout the whole book and made me skim through a lot of parts of the book.  I also hated that Eva was still involved with Brett, even as a friend.  I kept saying...WHY?  Maybe I should have taken a break between each book, but I read them back to back, so that may have influenced my apparent exhaustion by the time I got to book 3.  I will read book 4, though.
B008VVT51U|5.0|this is a movie one wants to watch over and over again; I especially enjoyed Maggy Smith and Judy Dench!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Thank you Amazon for the quick delivery of this movie. It is a great movie. The color and video quality are tops. The best movie of this type we have ever seen. Thanks, Bill Knaps
B0091REZMW|5.0|i just started  playing this game so far i have i have been force to exit game stemmingnfrom a freeze out.this review is part of a task related to the game..i am not feeling very positive about it.  Be careful to complete some task you have to purchase in-game currency.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I had this app for a long time, and it took really good pics. But then it started saying that it was not responding! I had to buy a new one, and that really annoyed me.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I enjoy playing this with my grandson but I was at level 25 and it kicked me back to 1. I sure could use some help. Thanks much
B0034DGPEU|5.0|My heart aches from all the suffering. We all need to learn  how horrific slavery was. Kathleen Grissom painted the picture.
B000BDLJBU|4.0|I bought this plug to replace an old one. It works fine but is a bit difficult to install. You will need a soldering iron.
B000H5U832|5.0|I received my DVD Movie very fast and I am very pleased with it. It plays well and has a beautiful clear picture. Thank you Amazon for carrying such great movies. Grand Kids love this movie. Thanks, Bill Knaps

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|City of bones was super fun! The Mortal Instruments is a great series I loved each book!! Read them all!!!!!
B000W745CU|5.0|This film, and all in the series, is great because folks of any age can enjoy it.  The story is full of life lessons and the film is very well made.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|The very first 'experiment' failed. Need I say more? There was no incentive to continue as faith in the book was broken. But I still have faith in the Divine. I just don't think it's so easy to put His laws into words so easily.
0553801473|5.0|The tv show brought me to it and the story telling has kept me, so much more complex than the former.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I know the alien invasion scenario has been done to death.. But this one's got real heart, great writing, acting, stays away from being to politically preachy or promoting any 'agendas'.. and that's getting hard to find!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I was very disappointed with the sex scene in the last show of the season as that was one of the draws to the show for me of minimal sexual content.
B007KW5MFE|5.0|Wesley Snipes at his Ultimate, Extreme BEST!!!! I give BLADE Six Stars!!!!<br />I wish they would do some more with Wesley Snipes of course.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|This is an updated version of the original, staying fairly true to the original story line, but with an improved production quality.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a very addictive game! I enjoy playing in for some down time. The characters are really cute. It is challenging enough for adults to play.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|enjoyed the book, got some good information about how to use a check list and the value it could bring. My only negative comment is that once he made his case he just kept repeating things.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect of the quality of this scanner, since it was much more affordable than others. It's perfect. Easy to stick a slide in, see it on the screen, and save it to a memory card. Definitely recommend.
B004Y1WCDE|2.0|After numerous attempts I gave up on plex for Android...it just didn't work. It successfully connected to my plex media maqnager and then nothing. As a matter of fact I gave up on Android COMPLETELY! I had no idea that starting with Android 4.1 there is NO SUPPORT FOR ADOBE FLASH!! I'm an amazon prime member and that means I could stream instant video, I gave my android tablet away and bought Microsoft Surface Pro and the Plex app is working great!
B0067RQYNW|1.0|0-zero stars  I was never able to open it, therefore I never used it. I deleated it from my Kendall.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Love all of the tracks start to finish cant wait till in the area to see them play this live
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this series I could read it over and over again. Suzanne is an excellent author. Her smooth writing makes you not want to put the book down. Get these, you will enjoy them
B0054N73EY|3.0|It's okay. It still has the funky basslines of Flea on most songs, the crazy lyrics of Anthony. I feel like the drumming could have been stronger. The guitar is eh. At least he tried? It's a new sound for sure. If you're looking for a extra-radio friendly sound RHCP, buy this album.
0307887898|5.0|Great book for those wanting to start their own business.  Great business tips and stories to learn from.  Enjoyable reading.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just love this series.  Have watched the complete series twice now.just can't wait for Season Four to come out.  Watch it!
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|this is a show everyone should check out.<br /><br />The characters are great and this series deserves many years forward.<br /><br />keep it going.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|My daughter suggested I listen to one of Lindsey's recordings. I was blown away. She is an amazing artist and the arrangements are exquisite. Like a combination of M83, Moody Blues and the best indie band, ever. I love everything she has done. If you liked the soundtrack from Oblivion the movie, you should enjoy this.
B009AY04A8|3.0|To much talking and not enough playing.<br /><br />Would have enjoyed it more if I could have searched for more items.  That however was not the case.
B000067CPX|5.0|With old sounds from Californication, and a modern sound that foretells Stadium Arcadium. John really get's on the ball for this album, and the band really comes together to project the sound for a 2002 RHCP.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I found it hard to put down.  I would recommend it.  I am going to buy the full version. thank you.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This has turned out to be one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite.  Nicholas Hoult is an absolute doll and he gives a tremendous performance as R.  He is truly going to be an up and coming star for years to come.  I am a zombie freak but this movie is a combination of comedy and drama and the ending is so worth seeing it.  It's a movie that leaves you feeling good when you walk out of the theatre.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My 4yo and 2yo daughters both loved this game until the most recent update that killed it. We worked so hard to get to the levels we got and are not willing to uninstall the game just yet and lose everything. Based on the reviews below, I am hoping gameloft will fix this in the next day or so and we can go back to the game as it was.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Just what I needed. Thought that my Kindle was not working anymore, and as soon as I replaced the cable came back to life. Thanks a lot
B009LQKHIO|3.0|This was a good book. The characters were well developed. A good story line, though a bit predictable. It was a good light vacation read. I enjoyed reading it and look forward to the next one in the series.
B000002LQR|5.0|By far my favorite RHCP album. The guitar tone is soft and punchy at the same time, but also crunchy when it has to be. The drums hold the tracks together, with a loud hard and proud sound. Flea always brings the best basslines to the mix, and Anthony matches the music perfectly. There's hardly a bad song on this album. Start from the beginning and listen all the way through. It's perfect in my eyes.
6305308659|5.0|In my opinion one of the more underrated films of the last 20 years. Very entertaining, well cast, well acted and with subtle and not so subtle layers of depth psychologically and socially. I would not have thought to order it except it was featured as a course at the American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting this year followed by a group discussion. I was so impressed that I ordered it and saw it a second time with my family who are very particular about movies. They loved it!
B0041OOEJY|4.0|Jaden Smith is so good in this rol as is Jackie Chang..  The fight scenes are mindboggling.  The karate is so much more believable than the original also.  Don't get me wrong the original with Ralph Macchio and Pat Noriyaki is a great movie.  It's just that the karate sequences are so much more authentic. Great movie
B0053TMP24|5.0|Percy is back!! Can't wait for the others. Can't wait to see him and Jason as a team. Hope Annabeth doesn't turn bad.

0446571415|5.0|I would recommend reading the other camel club books first, but this one may be the best of a great series.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a really nice alarm clock.  It also has a sleep timer so you go to sleep listening to white noise or music.  Very easy to use.
0143122916|5.0|No book is like this one. explains what life without any love whatsoever and living in a constant state of suspicion and distrust looks like besides providing valuable insight into life in North Korea. Also describes difficulty of adjusting to a &#34;more normal&#34; world.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game because it is a way May wife and I unwind after a tough day at work. Of all the hidden object games we enjoy Mystery Manor most.
B000ID1J0E|2.0|Maybe my age, but it was a bit too much and too long for me.<br />However I can see how the movie can have a strong following.
0064471837|5.0|I can't remember when I first read this book or how many times I've read it since then.  For me, this is one of those rare books that will never leave my imagination and has impacted the way everything else.<br />Above all else, Sabriel is a kind of coming-of-age story.  She is a girl that was raised in one world and thrust into a new world with an important position when her father disappears and she is forced to take up his mantle.  While being forced to embrace new responsibilities and find your way in a new world is a fairly typical path of fiction, the way Garth Nix tells his story is anything but.  Maybe it is just an attraction to action and the macabre, but I loved the concept of the Abhorsen with their bells and control over the dead.  I remember spending hours playing that I was the new Abhorsen and had to go on adventures to save the Old Kingdom from some new terror, and I believe that is the reason I keep coming back to this book.  It's inspiring and entertaining, with countless characters that are complicated and lovable, even when they aren't the typical heroes you normally cheer for.<br />I would and have recommended this book to friends countless times.  I hope that anyone else who picks it up enjoys it the same way I have over the years.
1401929281|5.0|As a teacher and practitioner of ThetaHealing, I highly recommend this book as the basic teaching of this very powerful modality.  Tens of thousands of people world wide are catching on to this teaching.  I have given away this volume for years.  Get yours today.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Amazing through and through.  Great songs - great rhythm, powerful lyrics, creative, influential.  Macklemore & Ryan Lewis nail it.<br /><br />AMAZING.
B00C04H2VO|4.0|The grandkids were so excited to receive and really liked.  The only thing I wish was different is if they were made to stand alone, not on the little &#34;pedestals&#34;.  Recommend.
B00B19GKI0|5.0|This a a pure cult classic from the 80's folks.  Kurt Russell at his finest.  Snake Plisken is doing damage and taking no prisoners. A must see for anyone who loves the 80's.  Period !
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's easy to learn and fun to play. If you're a fan of the movie, you'll enjoy the adorable characters and recognizable storylines. Great for kids and adults alike.
B0086700CM|1.0|I did not request this and we could not get rid of it. How do we get rid of it?
B009AP2G26|5.0|Music is fantastic storyline is good. I have no issues letting my Tweens watch glee. I find the humor cute too. Wholesome.
B00DT55OGS|5.0|It is always a happy day when the stupendous `Belle and Sebastian' release more of their beautiful music into the world. So I preordered this as did some of my chums. Then I got to listen to it on Auto rip before the disc arrived, and have been all over it like a proverbial rash ever since. This is essentially a compilation album that consists of rarities, collectibles and non LP tracks from the last decade. That is according to an email I received from the band's web site. It opens with a remix of `I'm a Cuckoo' remixed by The Avalanches and it is actually miles better than the original, just let it play out too as the song gets better and better with off kilter tribal backing vocals. Second track `Suicide Girl' is vintage Belle, if you half heard it from a distance you would know it is them, which is no bad thing at all.<br /><br />There is a new track called `Your Covers Blown' a Miaoux Miaoux Remix and it is rather ruddy good, with a driving beat and disco esque back beats. There are19 tracks here and unless you quite literally have everything by them there will be loads new here for you. This is a perfect accompaniment to `Push Barman to open old wounds' in that it takes the story further. There are a few tracks here that are not fully up to muster, but considering that these are all non album contenders, there are some absolute gems. `Desperation made a fool of me' is just sublime with its tinkling piano back beat and the glorious vocals it is one of those tracks you fall in love with straight away and know it will be for a very long time.<br /><br />Then we have the variety as ever and Stevie gets to stretch his tonsils on more than one occasion as does the lovely Sarah - check out the simply glorious `Heaven in the afternoon'. We also have a lovely homage to sixties guitar instrumentals in the shape of `Passion Fruit' and I just thought this is groovy without a shred of irony. `The Eight station of the Cross Kebab House' has reminiscences of ska, as well as trade mark fabbo lyrics with humour a plenty. That comes to the fore to in the penultimate track `Meat and Potatoes', which is a lovely ditty about hard core fetishes and is actually so melodic to avert your mind from the lyrics. The Richard mix of `I didn't see it coming' might be a bit of a 'Marmite' jobby as it goes all drum beats which reminded me of eighties numbers like that Band Aid one we can never forget. `I took a long hard look' is a sing along ballad type that is also instantly likeable.<br /><br />These days we are often pleased if there are two or three decent tracks on an album, which might explain the popularity of the download option. With Belle there is always something new and even when there is a song that you are not over enamoured with, you know these songs are nigh on always superior to their contemporaries, Belle and Sebastian do not really have an equal and for that reason alone this was always going to get a five star rating. There is enough here to keep you happy for a while to come and hopefully will tide you over till they bring out their next one which will be another simply stupendous day.trade mark fabbo lyrics with humour a plenty.

B0091JQH76|5.0|When I was about 12 or 13 years old, I went into what was probably one of the few sheet music stores in Atlanta at that time where Billy Munn was the proprietor. He was a friend of my grandmother and piano teacher, Edith Clark, organist and choir director at First Presbyterian Church of Atlanta. He knew that I was always on the lookout for interesting piano duets to play with my grandmother and recommended Poulenc's Sonata for Piano Duet.<br /><br />That would have been in about 1964 or 1965, and Poulenc would only have been dead a year or two.  Thus began my love affair with Poulenc's music that has only increased as the years have gone by.  Over the years I have amassed quite a collection of LPs, cassettes, CDs and scores of Poulenc's music as well as biographies and other analyses of the man and his music. When I discovered that EMI had issued a 20 CD complete edition of Poulenc's music commemorating the 50th anniversary of his death in 1963, I requested the set for this past Christmas.  What a treat to hear wonderful performances of works I have enjoyed for almost 50 years, and several that I was hearing for the first time.<br /><br />In the excellent booklet accompanying the CDs, Nicolas Southon remarks that even 50 years after his death, Poulenc still has some detractors. Perhaps that is because Poulenc is unafraid to treat light-hearted subject matter seriously, or conversely, serious subject matter with a combination of joy and humility. Wasn't it no less a figure than Debussy who said that music should humbly seek to please? I believe it was Poulenc himself who said that his was not the kind of music that one listens to with one's head in one's hands. No doubt he was too modest. How many 20th century composers could say that they have composed what is perhaps the most frequently performed opera written in the last half of the 20th century (Dialogues des Carmelites) that treats a serious subject seriously (fear, doubt, faith in God) and yet were not too stuffy to write a comical song about the tragic consequences of picking one's nose (\\"La Tragique Histoire du petit Ren&eacute;\\" from Quatre chansons pour enfants)? I remember reading a review of Poulenc's Sextuor for woodwinds and piano by a wind player who used a vulgar epithet in referring to the work. Poulenc's Sextuor is still performed all over the world, but I wonder whatever became of that wind player?<br /><br />In 1977, I was privileged to attend the original Metropolitan Opera production of Dialogues des Carmelites when the Met touring group brought it to Atlanta. In May of this year, my wife and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary by going to New York and attending the Met revival of Dialogues. As the voice of each nun who faced martyrdom at the guillotine was silenced, the stage was left bare except for a gigantic cross as the orchestra played the brief, solemn postlude. The audience sat for a moment in stunned silence. Then there was thunderous applause as the audience rose to its feet in tribute to the wonderful Met artists and this wonderful composer. Thank you, EMI, for issuing this terrific complete edition!
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I found the book very difficult to follow, but it was entertaining is a strange sort of way.  I regret the ending, although based on the story line, I see no other route.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great to have all the information in one place. The real time info really helps me plan my day.<br /><br />Great job.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Just regular U Tube is fine but we could not get it on the kindle. We had no other choice.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It is a basic alarm clock but it does the job. It's really intuitive. Get it! It's worth it. =)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The perks of being a wallflower is in my opinion the best coming off age story of our generation. I strongly suggest anyone and everyone read it and more importantly to appreciate its beauty.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Activation codes never showed up in my mailbox despite multiple requests.  Downloaded another FREE android printer app that works GREAT!  This app is indicative of what's wrong with HP.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season made me so mad!! I just cannot stand it! I won't put any spoilers but I can guarantee there will be tears and anguish for the audience. I was a little disappointed in the final incident just because it seemed so...I don't know...cheesy? Half hearted? Either way, this is still a beautifully brilliant series that I adore. And it's because I adore it that the things that happened this season made it so hard to watch! I am eager for season 4, especially with all the outcomes we have!
B0089BSM70|5.0|I am a big fan of horror movies and Michael Myers. I have every title on DVD so I went ahead and brought them on blu ray. When I heard shout factory was bring the TV version on DVD and blu ray I had to get it.
B008MM9630|3.0|I liked it until I saw I had to spend real money to get diamonds in order to complete tasks. I quit playing. I just can't afford to complete these tasks.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun playing. I have had problems with not receiving my bingo coins a couple of times when I have purchased them. I am still waiting for a response from the support team. Give me my COINS, PLEASE!!!!! So I can play some more. Thanks.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|This book was not what I expected. Not sure how she thought she could relate to long time prisoners when she only had a year to do and a loving family to return to.  Big deal.  I wish I hadn't wasted the money on this.
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|Why do these collections never come with the HD version of Metal Gear Solid 1 that came out for the Game Cube way back when?  Otherwise a great series!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|This game is fun but you only have 1 to 2 minutes to play it then you can not play it any more. It would be a great game if it gave you more time to play!
B0085Z3AMW|5.0|I am a big fan of horror movies and Michael Myers. I have every title on DVD so I went ahead and brought them on blu ray.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|It was thrilling compelling and a over good story. I highly recommend this book to any that loves sfy or a good book
0743297334|5.0|He has a great command of story.  Easy to fall into his world of fiction and wonderful characters.  Must read!
0385737955|3.0|This review applies to both this book and the series as a whole. In general, I found the books to be entertaining and their plots move forward at a pace that keeps it interesting and keeps you looking for more. The ideas that drive each book individually are unique, but the main thread of thought between all the books is somewhat cliche.<br /><br />The characters are extremely underdeveloped- the reader is left not really understanding them or what drives them. This weakness is compounded by the fact that the characters act and think irrationally, and when you combine this with the convoluted (but, again, interesting) plot they're both unbelievable and uninteresting.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this and the remainder of the series, and they are good books - but not great. Worth reading
B0022Y570K|5.0|Such sexy music; metal with a dance-able beat, who could ask for more? Makes me wanna wear a poodle skirt, commando with a greaser on my arm like I'm the coolest chic in the crowd. LOL
B009CF7JDU|5.0|It's a classic! I could watch this movie 20 times in a row and never get bored! Great movie! They need to make feel good movies like this again
B00ECUARO8|4.0|A good store, but not great. Some of the acting was less-than-desirable.  The action was good and I understood the ending, but I got anxious for its coming.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This series is well priced.[a bargain] My wife and I both sat through every episode.  Rare for both of us to enjoy the same thing. Only caution I would give is that it is not suitable for young children. Adults will enjoy this series on many levels.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I hope, I will never come across the phrase, &#34;he had his release&#34;, ever again.<br />It was generally a bad read. Reviews lie.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I like the way it keeps track of my passwords and inserts them on Login to may accounts, Games or whatever
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Get it if you like magic! You won't be disappointed, playa like ps3 version and looks awesome. Using it on my babies nabi hahahah
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|The first of Nesbo and a good beginning for his usual action-packed and assortment of characters involved in an intricate plot.  The twists and turns keep you turning the page.
1451695195|5.0|This was an excellent book for those skeptics of Heaven's existence.  For those of us that believe that the Bible is the word of God the book was not needed for any substantiation of Heaven but it did give a scientific or medical view of what was evident within God's word.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Great album! I totally enjoyed it from start to finish! A7X have definitely grown over time and this album is proof of that. It is very different from previous efforts and that only makes it better. That is something worth of A7X, every album is different from the previous one showing significant maturity. I completely recommend Hail to the King, to my opinion best A7X album so far.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|A great novel, with a lot of thrilling, and some pf human nature. I will surprose you a lot of times
B00992CF6W|3.0|Every time I find diamonds on a world and make some tools it starts to get really boring. It really needs more updates they should add wolves and caves and other generated structures.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|This movie still stands and I think it is by far a very well done film. I can watch it multiple times and not get bored with it.
B00CE10XQO|5.0|funny little anecdote's Enjoyed this very much my kids loved it ,the lines spoken rather unspoken by characters are crazy funny rolling on the ground laughing....
B004J4WKTW|4.0|a very interesting book.  well worth reading. interesting characters, good plot, and I don't know why I have to write so many words!
0142410705|5.0|Much like all books by John Green, this book was absolutely amazing. I recommend his books to everyone who asks. An Abundance of Katherines deserves more praise than it gets.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Having fun going through the levels, some faster than others. Can be very challenging when you're thinking one way and the game is thinking the other!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I didn't have trouble with the first nine rooms but the last one was a challenge. The game is great and I cant wait for the additional rooms.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best series on TV.. It is loved by all..  I know alot of men thinks this is a women's show,  but I think men will like it also
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|I like this movie. Pretty funny and I like Leslie Mann as an actress she is funny  I wouldn't recommend for kids though
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Should have different weapons for missiles and easier ways to get repair points. Game gets too hard after level 20
B00AK57N00|4.0|Its a fun game and great time waster. Not bringing down the house on the graphics, but honestly thats not the point of this game. just swinging from platform to platform is all you need sometimes.<br />Hasn't crashed for me, I enjoy it
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Not the best acted movie in the world but lots of action. Lots of one liners as one would expect.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game ever all you people have to rate 5 on this game I play all the time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Need more levels but I enjoyed it. Can't wait for the new ones. Ten wasn't enough but they were challenging.
078322804X|5.0|I love this movie anyways so the only way that it would get a bad review is if the DVD would not play. So thank you for sending me a functional disk.
B002QRWJA4|3.0|Gerard Butler has become my new &#34;high school crush&#34;-- I haven't had one in years! His voice was instrumental in making this rather tepid version of The Phantom more than just bearable. His rendition of Music of the Night was amazing, and I felt compelled to download it after the movie was over. Minnie Driver's character was amusing, but not much else stands out in the movie. The special effects for the movie ending were particularly cheesy.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|The begining of season one is somewhat slow. They take time developing the storyline. Once it get's going you will be hooked. GREAT GREAT show.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is quirky fun at its best.  Ted  never tells a dull story. Worth waiting to see who is the mother.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Good job with keeping with the story line from the book. The acting was great and the effects were better.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|since the update on the kindle, I can no longer play the game. it just crashes everytime.  very unhappy. fix the update and rate will change. &gt;:[
1594204217|5.0|While I have to admit Michael Pollan made me mad in the Omnivore's Dilemma when he surmised that Registered Dietitians were naive agents of the government (as I am an RD) I still find his work intelligent and inspiring. I am a Foodie (omg, there's that word again) so I love reading anything I can about food and those who prepare it. It was fascinating to read about his journey in learning about cooking food- his twist; the four elements- Fire, Water, Air and Earth. It came down to BBQ (where he referenced local Pitmaster, Ed Mitchell), braising, baking, and fermenting. My favorite chapter was Earth/fermentation. It's so important to remember our bodies are an ecology and we need to keep our bacteria happy to keep us healthy. I'm already a HUGE fan of kimchi, but I loved the other references to feremented foods/probiotics. If you are into food in any way, this is a must read. He is a fabulous writer and will draw you in very quickly.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I am happy that I have Michael's last performances. I enjoy getting an opportunity to see his<br />genius behind the scenes as well on the stage. I still miss him. He is truly the King of POP!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Just fantastic. Can't wait for the next one. Get this, you will enjoy it no doubt! Could have kept playing for hours if it had been longer. Not too hard and not super easy. Perfect game!!!!
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I'm usually more of a Sci Fi guy but this was a really interesting find. Kept my attention to the end. Going to read the next one.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder by R.J. Palacio is such a good book. In the beginning it was kind of slow but, after I got in to it, it was amazing. I would recommend this book to everyone who likes a good fast read. August (AKA Auggie) had to overcome so much in his life just because of his birth defect.  This story warms my heart because of everything he overcomes.  Some of the chapters were sad like the when Daisy the family dog dies. Some chapters were happy like when they got Bear.  Just in case you were wondering they named the new dog bear because when Auggie's mother saw the dog she thought it was a bear.<br />  August is such an inspiration character because; when life throws you lemons you make lemonade!!!!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Mostly entertaining novel, with a few slow sections.  Loved the relationship between the two boys from different sides of the tracks, so to speak.  I would recommend this to friends, however it does not live up to my expectations from his first novel.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The game is great for youngsters. Makes the time go fast in doctors office and other long boring appointments. Also great for car rides.
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|This should be standard listening for any aspiring classical pianist.  There are so many gems in this collection, you will be inspired by Mr. Kempff's true mastery of Beethoven.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|keeps saying I have the game when I try to download but<br />  I don't see the game anywhere. anyone else have this problem?
0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brain Selznick is the best book in my opinion because it was written beautifully. Also, it has wonderful pencil sketches on some of the pages in the book. I personally liked this book because the characters are enemies in the beginning, but at the end they become besties.  If I were to see this book on a shelf, not knowing anything about it, I would most definitely select this book because of it size and illustrations on the front cover.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Entertaining and informative but not in depth.  I gave some interesting facts but I expected more only to find at the end that it is a teaser for a larger work about him.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|it crashes allllll the time! I cann't really rate it on layout or anything like that cause I cann't even get into the damn app!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I have never reviewed a book in my life.  This book so deserved one.  The sex was great, but the things  that come out of Drews mouth is what had me at hello.  He is hysterical.  Do yourselves a favor and buy the book already.  I couldn't put it down. Thanks Emma.  You did a bang up job.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have had this in my Wishlist for quite a while and finally ordered it. I have enjoyed doing Jillian's workout. It is challenging!
B002P8O29K|5.0|An amazing motion picture achievement, made better by digital cleanup and transfer.<br />Time it was, and what a time it was. Descent into hell, with your expert tour guides<br />the Rolling Stoned. You play with fire, you're gonna get burned. That Mick Taylor,<br />man, did he play with fire. But escaped just in time. Serious viewers will note that<br />you can't improve upon the grainy original 16mm film quality, but the soundtrack is<br />awesomely done in the remix. An amazing motion picture achievement.
B00B1RB942|5.0|I do love anime and this is just what I like the characters are likeable and grow on you. They show that classic japanese family persona which is just awesome. The way the story is portrayed is great. I will say as always this movie is not really for kids I suggest watching it first or look at the rating and make a judgment call cause not all cartoons are for kids.
B005BZQS1E|1.0|boyfriend watched this the other night while i was out with friends.  said it was awful and not worth the money spent ordering it on amazon streaming.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i like this game a lot its really fun and u can play with ur friends and have a gud time playing. u can buy costumes for ur minion and buy new things to get lots of bannanas .This game is really cool! :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|They've done it again! What a great device and for $35 dollars and the original free 3 months of netflix who could resist. This thing is still a work in progress but has huge potential. It works great for supported apps like netflix and youtube along with chrome browser casting. Can't wait for them to roll out the full SDK so app developers can utilize it. If you want to stream local content from your computer onto your tv just drag it into the chrome browser and poof it will cast.
0345548981|5.0|This is a brilliant book. Very interesting subject, beautifully written with many entertaining background stories. I have tried his advice and am fascinated with results. I feel better than ever, although I have never suffered from any allergies. It just makes so much sense.  Everybody would profit from reading it. I have already told all my friends and family about this book and will be buying it to them as birthday presents...
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Challenging, but fun game. Can be addictive. I have caught myself sometimes playing for hours at a time. I highly recommend it.
0307346617|2.0|hard to get into.  every few pages it jumps to a new person/location/storyline.  at some point, i'm sure they will all start connecting but it's really tough to stay interested when you're so confused.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's a great app I as a parent like it my self so I have to say that you should buy this app
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|At first I thought that this would be a standard girl-falls-for-bad-boy kind of book. And at first, it starts off that way. But somewhere in the middle WHOMP you're like hit over the head and thrown into this loop and it's like WOAH. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It didn't exactly bring me to my knees like Slammed did but it was a good page turner. This is nothing compared to Slammed. But this is a good story all on its own. Just prepare yourself for a lot of plot twists.
0307266303|5.0|My brother-in-law suggested this book to me several years ago and I read it and absolutely loved it.  The book tells a great story and I learned many things about the Human Anatomy and how people survived several centuries ago.  I purchased this as a gift to a born again runner as motivation to keep at it. I personally am not a person who reads books twice but I have considered re-reading this jewel.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Is a fun app. Hard but not hard enough to make you not want to play it.needs more levels.my kids had fun with it.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|watched it earlier this year at a friend's place and ordered it on amazon the next day for a great price.  have showed it to friends to get them into it as well.  beautiful love story.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I recommend this show to anyone who enjoys how the British live.  It is so entertaining and done so well.  I love the characters but hated to see Matthew go.
B001ECQ6PG|5.0|Because I have a modest collection of records (various LPs and 45s and several 78s too), and I needed a smaller, more portable turntable to play them on. I got a great deal on this turntable, and found it to be just what I need! Most of the time I use it to listen to records in my room, though sometimes I'll bring it to the thrift store or used record shop when going on a vinyl shopping excursion to sample any records I may find interesting (particularly to make sure I'm getting the right song or something.) It fits pretty well in my backpack, and the fact that it's battery-operated means I don't have to bring the power supply when I go out on such an excursion!<br /><br />It plays records really well, and the built-in speaker works pretty well too, though in order to get that going I needed to hook it up to my MacBook first via the USB port and digitize one of my records (ANOTHER reason I bought it), and that did the trick! I mostly play LPs and 45s on it, but not 78s very often, as the kind of stylus on the tonearm may not be the best for those old 78-RPM records (for those I may dig out my even older turntable with a flippable cartridge for playing the 78s, but the sound quality isn't as good.) I do like the tone control, and the pitch changing knob, as on default speed it plays the records a tad fast, and I have perfect pitch so it's noticeable to me. Just turning it down a tiny bit makes the records sound just right.<br />Digitizing the records is good, too. It sure beats going to the trouble downloading the MP3s, when you can just copy them to the computer. Some songs do sound better on vinyl, and they'll sound even better after a bit of cleaning and tuning up via Audacity once the song is on your computer.<br /><br />I even brought this record player with me to my mascot job at the local minor league ballpark one day when it looked like the game would be rained out, to entertain the staff with (me dancing to the records while in costume!) They all enjoyed that.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator does just what it says it will do - not many frills - accurate math calculations. Just what I wanted!
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|Good acting, especially from the younger actors, but not enough story. Too easy to guess what would happen and too unbelievable.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This is a great song to dance, work out it just good music. Thank u Gaga can't wait til the cd comes out.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|We've been watching the series in order.  Disks 1 thru 5 were perfect.  Insert disk, movie pops right up (no ads or commercials), all usual functions work including bookmarking.  Disks 6 and 7 have several ads each, very poor sound quality and the bookmarking functions does not work.  Haven't got to #8 yet.  Will update review when we do.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|One of the funniest bingo games to play on kindle.  Easy to learn for the little grand kids too.  Would recommend to anyone.
B000P12LWY|5.0|The Tudors was terrific.  The acting especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers was exceptional.  Watched the entire series over a two-week period, could not stop watching it.  I now want to see everything that Jonathan Rhys Meyers stars in, especially the Elvis series.<br /><br />I would definitely recommed.  There are some gruesome scenes.  So brace yourself.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|So you have 3 maps (so far) 4 categories of players fighters, guardians, mages, support. There are tons of heroes to choose from and upgrades to characters. I love it it's lots of fun, does require teamwork.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|Love it can't wait to see him live this fall!  Song choices are really good. Favorite is thank you. What a great rendition.
0375703764|1.0|The author spends half his time making sure the reader knows how clever he is and the other half filling his mangled book with gimicks. As for horror I can't say it was ever well enough written for me to care enough to be afraid. Every twist is foreseeable and the ending left much to be desired. A deep book for those who don't want to read a deep book.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Used to watch this on the USA, and like it even more. Gabriel Macht and Patrick Adams are awesome.  Watching re-runs
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I already loved Adele before I purchased this CD and now I can listen to it anytime I want to. She is truly a fabulous singer with a lot of heart and soul in her music and voice. Recommend to everyone.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Fun but hard to play on a small screen. Music and story compliment the visuals nicely. The only difficult issue I have is trying to expand the image without making a negative selection.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first two were great now on to see how it all ends.I just can't stop reading these books AMAZING!!!!
B000XR4OC0|4.0|Pretty comfortable. I have problem feet (high arches and then an ankle that has a plate and screws). I've found these shoes to be great for walking around NYC. I usually wear Sperrys, and I find them comparable, though the Tom's have a foam insole that's a bit more forgiving. They are bit slippy though, so I can't imagine they'd be good in any amount of rain.
0553212761|5.0|Obviously, having grown up reading Jane Austen, Shakespeare, Thomas Hardy, and George Elliot, I have given my therapist much needed income. A lovely read.  I wish that we could return to a time of manners.
B005EVVESM|5.0|This is a great CD if you love Maroon 5 as much as I do it is a must for you to purchase. Then you can listen and you will have &#34;The Moves Like Jagger&#34; Too!!!
0451213092|5.0|I love Ken Follett's books, so I did not hesitate to buy this kindle version. I did not research the details of the book before I purchased as I am gradually reading all Ken's books!<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed it, thinking it was a novel, only to realize in the latter stages that it was all true!<br /><br />To write a non fiction book that is so good it reads like a novel is true genius!!<br /><br />well done, Ken Follett!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I ordered this for my husbands birthday.  It arrived quickly of course we all know the movie was good.  What else can I write about it?
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Will watch  again... Good content and story. Special effects were fantastic and the acting was also good. Maybe a sequel ?

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I love Bruno Mars and this CD was as expected from him. GREAT!!!! Recommend to anyone. Buy it and listen for yourself.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing. It speaks with such honesty that some people don't have half a mind to tell. Sad ending, but I think without the ending it had it wouldn't be so... truthful. I sure hope you loved this book as much as I did. I will surely cherish this book.
B00CZF87TY|5.0|my entire family loves this movie, though its not better than the original it still made us laugh so we had to get the soundtrack
B000FC1MCS|5.0|So cool that this was written from the point of view of an autistic child. Great read. Would highly recommend.
B000ICM5MG|5.0|All Rocky fans should own the Rocky (Two-Disc Collector's Edition DVD) because of the amazing extras (close to 3.5 hours of content including a video commentary and 3 audio commentaries). Notably, the audio commentaries were not included in the Rocky BD or the Rocky Undisputed BD Collection. The Rocky 2-disc DVD is jammed with more content for a single film than almost any of its era.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />New high-definition transfer<br />New audio commentary by Sylvester Stallone<br />New audio commentary by boxing legends, trainer Lou Duva and commentator Bert Sugar<br />Commentary by the director, producers, and cast members, Three-part making-of documentary &#34;In The Ring&#34;, &#34;Three Rounds With Legendary Trainer Lou Duva&#34; featurette, &#34;Interview With A Legend: Bert Sugar&#34; featurette, &#34;The Opponents&#34; featurette, &#34;Steadicam: Then & Now&#34; featurette, &#34;Make Up!: The Art and Form With Michael Westmore&#34; featurette, &#34;Stacatto: A Composer's Notebook With Bill Conti&#34; featurette, &#34;The Ring Of Truth&#34; featurette, Deleted Scenes, TV spots, TV appearances and trailers, Sneak Peak at Rocky Balboa, 24-page collectible booklet.<br /><br />Buy this 2-Disc Collector's Edition. It still has the most special features for Rocky available on any format (DVD or BD). Go ahead and buy [[ASIN:B002M9WW30 Rocky: The Undisputed Collection (Rocky / Rocky II / Rocky III / Rocky IV / Rocky V / Rocky Balboa) [Blu-ray]]] if you want the sequels in one set but it is an average release at best.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, you don't mess with the special investigators, and Reacher proves it again.  I like that Reacher has his team back, makes him a little less of a loaner.  Great action made it a fast read, oh and let's not forget the ladies love him.

193700788X|4.0|FINALLY! I was so ready for this series to be over! It didnt end the way I wanted it to, but I am a little biased to Eric the bad boy, although if there was another guy I wanted Sookie to be with it was Sam. Maybe I'll re-read them in a few years...
B004EPYZXU|2.0|Apollo 18 surprised me in theaters. It uses a found footage format to make this into a pseudo space documentary/horror film. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Dimension Films head Bob Weinstein \\"balked at the idea\\" that the film was a work of fiction, stating that \\"We didn't shoot anything; we found it. Found, baby!\\" The production comes across as very amateur as a result which is hard to swallow because most of us don't bring handheld cameras to the moon. The Blair Witch Project is more convincing because the low-budget props and acting worked in the forest but doesn't work in space. When I saw Blair Witch I could deal with the premise because that movie doesn't ask the audience for too much but it is so obvious that this is not the \\"lost footage\\" from the Apollo 18 mission in 1974 that the whole idea comes across as cheesy. Even Paranormal Activity seems more \\"real\\" and offers some decent jump scares. This film is suspense-free and not scary at all. The props look like Radio Shack quality. It is apparent the actors are pushing buttons on a children's toy when it is supposed to be a computer worthy of a space flight (however antiquated the technology might seem to us now). The filmmakers tried to capitalize on the theme, popularity and dialogue from the excellent Apollo 13. If I hear, \\"the LEM, the LEM, we have to get back to the LEM\\" one more time I will scream in a place no one can hear me. Admittedly, the Blu-ray picture and audio quality are fairly good. There is 25 minutes of total bonus content. You also get a DVD and digital copy in this release. Skip this and buy Apollo 13, Alien or Event Horizon instead, which are all excellent space films (though Apollo 13 is obviously not horror). Amazon reviewers rate this a lowly 2.5 stars.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1/1.78:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, Spanish<br />Special Features: Audio Commentary, Deleted Scenes, Alternate Endingleted Scenes, Alternate Ending
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|Dave (Jason Sudeikis) is a small time drug dealer who finds himself in trouble. In order to square things, he agrees to travel to Mexico and smuggle back drugs. To make passage easier he creates a family illusion with the formulas misfits. Rose (Jennifer Aniston) is a stripper who just quit her job and can't pay her rent. Kenny (Will Poulter) is the inexperienced neighbor boy abandoned by his mother. Casey (Emma Roberts) is a homeless girl who hangs out in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Of course they get into trouble along the way. The plot of the film wasn't over powering. The comedy was watching these dysfunctional people come together as a family, even if it is just a mock family. The humor is often crude (It's a skateboard!) with Aniston reviving some of her potty mouth from &#34;Horrible Bosses.&#34;<br /><br />There were some laughable moments, but overall it is a soft 4 stars.<br /><br />On the perv factor...the Aniston striptease which comes near the end was designed to be hot as she peels down to her undergarments. However, the truth be told, Demi Moore was better and bolder. There I said it.<br /><br />Parental Guidance: Plenty of F-bombs, crude talk and humor. No sex. Brief male Internet nudity. Women bra/panties.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What can you say, everyone today lives with facebook. if not having kindle I would be on my lap top

B004EPZ070|5.0|I LOVE this movie! Such a good, funny movie, and the quality was great I've watched it over and over again.
B0009RCPY8|2.0|This 2-disc DVD pack with both Ghostbusters films is average at best. Ghostbusters fans deserve better. The worst part is that this double feature is the best Ghostbusters collection available in any format because the promised Blu-ray release was announced in 2008 but has never arrived. Available in bargain bins everywhere for under $3 along with Apollo 18 and The Last Exorcism. Ghostbusters 2 hasn't been released on Blu-ray at all. The promised remastering on DVD, Blu-Ray and Blu-Ray 4K doesn't look great in any format. You can buy this value pack elsewhere for less money because this release is far from deluxe. It has been reported the negative for Ghostbusters is damaged resulting in difficulty transferring it onto home video releases.
B008JFUN50|4.0|Elysium is the name of an orbiting satellite. It has a controlled environment and is where the rich and powerful live. The United States has been reduced to a land of illegals in an extension of class warfare. Health care is different for the rich than the poor. The &#34;illegals&#34; attempt to go to Elysium to get health care. The film also is an extension of surveillance drones, automated robots, and how computers run the world.<br /><br />In an unusual role Jodi Foster plays Delacourt, the emotionless Secretary of Defense who protects Elysium. At times she is similar to Jack Nicholson in &#34;A Few Good Men&#34; and really needed to be more like him. It was not a good role for her. Matt Damon plays Max in his usual man against the system. After an industrial accident, Max has 5 days to live and opts to join the resistance against the powers of Elysium.<br /><br />I have not read the book, but you can tell from the film that the book was better as there are massive parallels to today's society which most likely the film couldn't incorporate them all. Yet at the same time, I felt a bit bogged down by the overtness of this morality film.<br /><br />Good looking graphics. Good ending. Fair plot. Dialogue needed to be lighter. Politically to the left.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|Very good and smart made watch. Kids can put it together by themselves and change the look as often as they want. So far works promptly.

B0016BU6ME|4.0|A 2-pack Ghostbusters for Blu-ray was first announced in 2008. Some previous Blu-ray releases of these films had video transfers that weren't up to snuff (they appeared to be DVD quality). The audio was noticeably better than the picture. Most extras from the 2-pack 2006 DVD are included except the animated episodes.<br /><br />Scheduled Extras from Old Spec Sheets:<br />* Digitally Mastered Audio and Video (BD Exclusive)<br />* Slimer Mode: Picture-in-Picture Graphical Viewing Experience with an examination of the spook-hunters' firehouse headquarters, an in-depth exploration of the creatures in the Ghostbusters mythology, behind-the-scenes discussions of making the movie, new cast, crew and special effects artists interviews and much more!

This will be the fourth time (at least) the films have been remastered on disc.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Beautiful movie. Intense. Visually striking. Psychological thriller. What more could you ask for in a ballet movie? I'd give this more stars but that's not allowed.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite versions of the show.  Alfie Boe is wonderful.  The music haunts the soul.  It is a great addition to my other versions of Les Miserables.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|A fast moving, can't put it down page turner.  I just hope Mr. Clancy keeps turning them out.  I'm retired Law Enforcement after 32 years.  I still enjoy seeing the :Good Guys&#34; win and seeing the &#34;Bad Guys&#34; get their butts whipped and handed to them on a silver platter.
B000Q66JXA|3.0|Well-acted and great looking fantasy film about King Arthur. This is my favorite film version of Camelot. All the elements of the mythology are here. This Blu-ray also has more subtitles and captioning options than I've ever seen. The main draw is that Excalibur looks and sounds better than ever on Blu-ray but it still needs a good remastering. I rate the film 5 stars and the Blu-ray 3 stars. My complaint is that we don't get any new extras for the film and only one has ever been released (the original audio commentary track by John Boorman). Fans may not want to upgrade until the film is remastered and 2 hours of bonus content is added.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/MPEG-4 AVC   Aspect Ratio: 1.78:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French Dolby Digital Mono, Spanish Dolby Digital Mono, Portuguese Dolby Digital Mono, German Dolby Digital Mono, Italian Dolby Digital Mono, Czech Dolby Digital Mono<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German SDH, Italian SDH, Czech<br />Special Features: Director's Commentary, Theatrical Trailer

B000RH0C8G|5.0|Great. The book was definitely worth reading for enjoyment and has a great storyline with a lot of twist and turns keeping you on this one way adventure.
0345472322|3.0|This book had some insightful ideas and thoughts on how the mind works and more importantly how to think using the \\"growth mindset\\" versus the \\"fixed mindset\\".  It provided some useful scenarios to help demonstrate the point but there were times where I thought personal research presented by the author lacked much substance.  Overall a good read that allows you to identify what type of mindset you may currently have and ways to help you achieve one that's more positive for yourself as we'll as for those you may have influence over (parents, teachers, coaches).
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Of course I became a David Tennant fan when he was the Doctor.  Broadchurch is a compelling drama and Tennant is a gritty detective with lots of flaws.  Fantastic show.

We have played them over and over, it is the only hidden object game that we will play over again! All 3 of them have been great so far, I think my favorite is the 3rd one because of the story line!
B00DW3Y2CE|5.0|Watain is the shit, they always have been... From their lyrical content to their sincerity as artists, they rank among the best. What Mayhem, Burzum and Darkthrone all started is not lost on Watain because Watain compliments the genre of black metal as opposed to polluting it.<br /><br />Plus they're Swedish. But that only matters to me because I'm Swedish.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|this app is great!  it allows you to view the forecast across the world, the globe, etc.  the only thing is, you cant view without wi-fi (like most apps) and its a battery hog.  However, I got a really good use out of it.  it works great!

B004UID2LC|4.0|I am a big anime fan and this app helps me a lot.  it allows me to download music and video that is sent to my gallery on my kindle.  the only two disclaimers are that:<br />1. you cant do anything without wi-fi<br />2. you cant watch music videos or things by a big time artist<br />maybe those will work for you, I dont know.  other than that, this app is great and I highly recommend it for you!

B00CUKTG2Q|3.0|How many of you like me were enamored with Franz Ferdinand back in 2004? It's hard to describe, but something about that debut album lit a post-punk fuse in me. I'd just begun listening to Gang of Four and had dabbled in The Jam as well. These cats were just the right modern take on a untouchable music noise that I was just beginning to love. I imagined Ray Davies sounding like \\"Michael\\", \\"Darts Of Pleasure\\", \\"This Fire\\", and the excellent \\"Come On Home\\" had he been born 20 years later. Alex Kapranos had this mix of snarky ambiguity and genuine sad sackery in his vocals and lyrics on that first album that I thought for sure they'd be spanking other revivalists of the same ilk in years to come. So I wasn't completely correct in that assumption. But I wasn't completely incorrect. You Could Have It So Much Better had these Scottish Orange Juice disciples putting their dance shoes away so they could show some rock machismo. Then 2009s Tonight: Franz Ferdinand was a mix of rock n' roll noise, dance floor strut, and Moog freakouts. Most folks in-the-know would say both of the follow-ups were sorta failures(records sales say differently), at least artistically. I'm not in-the-know.  I'm just a schlub from the Midwest that likes his beer strong, his pizza drowned in cheese, and his dance rock boogie-inducing. Franz Ferdinand have been known to be a bit bitey, rather cheesy at times, and can make this middle-aged white guy want to strut his wares more often than not. Well, after nearly breaking up, Franz Ferdinand have returned 4 years later with Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action, and while not breaking new ground have made the best with the fertile soil they've been working for nearly 10 years.<br /><br />\\"Right Action\\" opens up with a familiar funky groove and a Kapranos sneer that tells you we're back in sweaty pub territory. It's a less venomous version of \\"Take Me Out\\", sped up and some farfisa organ thrown in for good measure. \\"Evil Eye\\" has a great 80s dance beat to it, with a sound not unlike Madness doing a spy theme. Kapranos and company have taken the great production values of Tonight: Franz Ferdinand and the grittier songs of their debut to make something that sounds crisp and tight, but not overproduced. \\"Love Illumination\\" is the single and while it's got some cool fuzzy guitar and even a horn section the track doesn't really go anywhere. \\"Right Action\\" would've been a great single choice. But like I said, I'm just a schlub. \\"Stand On The Horizon\\" is a nice little ballad that doubles as a dance floor disco burner. \\"Bullet\\" churns and burns but sorta sits in one gear, but it's got a great chorus.<br /><br />We get a lot of the same throughout the rest of this album. There's moments that shine, and others that sorta sit and wait for your approval. It's sorta sad for me, as in my eyes the Franz Ferdinand that won me over with their angular riffs and snarky storytelling don't need anyone's approval. As long as they do what they do best they'll be just fine. Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action isn't going to floor you. I'll admit it, Franz Ferdinand are a guilty pleasure. But guilty pleasure or not, they shouldn't be written off. There's enough here for you to dig your teeth into. And hey, you can go ahead and shake what the Lord gave ya.  It'll be our secret.eat to it, with a sound not unlike Madness doing a spy theme.

B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|The script was not the best but Tom Cruise pulled it off as usual, the script did not have the usual Tom Cruise action but was not boring, it required better acting to pull it off.
0316017930|5.0|Very illuminating about the roles of variables in our lives. Engaging for me as a Social Scientist and my wife with little background on the subject matter.

B005LAII80|5.0|Picks up from the old Stallone Judge Dredd movie, if you liked the original, forget it and you'll like this future cop/judge that dispenses justice as required by the law, this would really be the way to do it but it will never happen because it would put a few million lawyers out of work.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Classic feel with innovative style from the youtube sensation.  My favorite song is the Borne series theme song but all of them are good.
0345803493|4.0|This is a good book depending on what you're looking for. I wouldn't say it's the most advanced piece of literature, but I don't think that's why most people buy this novel.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Truly amazing. Complex plot line, and a perfect balance of tragedy and triumph - with just enough laugh out loud moments.  Cannot wait for the next one.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Good action flick, following the original Bourne trilogy, good script but the actor was a let down if you saw and liked the first 3 Bourne with Matt, who seemed to be a natural for the part.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Boardwalk Empire is great writing and acting rolled into one big enchilada.  Would buy again with no reservations.  HBO has done it with this one.
0345803493|4.0|I would consider purchasing the third book. Such great brain candy reading! It's not the most in-depth reading, but for what it is, it's entertaining.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|A fantastic little gadget that does all that is advertised. It's great to be able to see my sleep cycle using the partner app as well as track my movement throughout the day.<br />Only slight criticisms would be that the matte finish means that the screen is not as sharp as it could be, and reading the display while attached to a belt in bright light is impossible.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|This toolkit is used everyday to repair phones and electronics. I am very pleased with this brand and the quality of bit they use. The flexible driver is now invaluable to me!!
B004EPYZPS|2.0|I just viewed this on amazon Prime before deciding if I wanted to purchase the Blu-Ray or not.  There is a solid reason why I hate JJ Abrams, and this proves no different.  Plausible and predictable story line, trying to be \\"edgy\\" in photography when all you really get is a headache and just poor direction.  You would think being he destroyed the STAR TREK franchise, he could at least do some homage to his own written movie...apparently not. Do not waist money purchasing this, if you REALLY want to see it, and yu are a Amazon Prime member view it for free and save yourself the embarrassment of ordering.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game has various degrees of difficulty and is a great exercise for the brain.<br />I enjoy all levels over and over. Always a challange.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|I love this CD.  I have other stuff from Darlene, but this tops them all.  The ministry value alone.... Wow! Very powerful.  And, the quality of the recording -- even though its live -- is much better than the older stuff.

0062255657|4.0|This was chosen by the book club of which I'm a member.  It's a cautionary children's tale of reality-based magic, written for adults.  Some have argued that the adult elements in the book seemed an afterthought, but I feel that even if they hadn't been put in, it would still keep any lover of a good story interested, be they adult or adolescent.  The few negatives I found with it had more to do with physical aspects of the book, i.e. it's a rather expensive book for such a short read.  Having said that, it is a rather nicely-bound book, and the cover is quite pretty.<br /><br />Plot: 8/10<br />Characters: 7/10<br />Setting: 8/10<br />Potential for Book Club Discussion: 8/10<br /><br />P.S.  If you're a cat lover, as I am, I think you'll get more out of this book, as it definitely plays with those sentiments.
B00C2PO09I|5.0|is a excellent movie, great image and music, the director say never do another movie like ths because is a headache , two worlds two gravitys required two scene , is very complicated, but is fresh . i love the landscape , the music , is a movie to see with your wife or girlfriend.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|I have a Fiio e7 and the e17 is what I would consider a huge upgrade for the price difference. I was rather unimpressed by the e7 as it sounded very, very similar to my onboard sound. I was unsatisfied enough that I began researching for a possible upgrade just a few weeks after buying it. I needed to have a USB DAC though so I didn't have too many options in this price range. I decided I would try the e17 and if it didn't meet my expectations I would give up on headphone amps altogether.<br /><br />Luckily, the e17 exceeded my expectations. I noticed the difference in sound immediately. The soundstage on my SHURE SRH840's improved and the sound is clearer. And there's actually useful tone controls. I normally avoid EQ's and tone controls like the plague, but the e17 actually has the ability to adjust the bass and treble without distorting the sound negatively.<br /><br />I highly recommend this dac/amp.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book has made it into my top 15 favorite books! I spent more than a few late nights as a result of not being able to put the book down, and am now sad to have finished it. I will definitely be reading it again at some point.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I like this game more than most hidden object games here. I like that it has a storyline and good graphics. It is not super difficult but enough so to be enjoyable.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This was a really facinating story with lots of action and intrigue.  The movie was true to the story line in the book and was greatly enjoyed.  The story is too violent for small children, but appropriate for teens and up.  All in all, very enjoyable.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I'm addicted to the show and can't wait until season two. Getting more insight to Piper was great. Love this one.
B008602KQI|3.0|loved Jennifer Lawrence! did not at all like the premise of the movie...to think that human beings could even think up this type of travesty against each other is beyond my thinking. i dreaded the thought of even watching this movie, when my grandson told me he had already seen it. so i had to see what it was all about. It was well done, and outside of the violent scenes, it was suspenseful entertainment if one can imagine it to be unreal.
B004QSQML8|5.0|I didn't know there had been 2 releases of the movies (movie studios, please leave the director's vision alone). I was expecting the American release and was a trifle confused at first until I googled the movie and found out about the worldwide release, which frankly is a better movie.
B008EKMB82|5.0|This is a wonderful story -- and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to be completely immersed in a book from the very first pages.  Warning:  addictive...
B009186E3O|5.0|Great film, fabulous overall package. This really is terrific for a fan of the Stones 60s stuff. Probably the best quality live footage of the band available, in both video and audio from that era.
B005544V6A|5.0|Im totally & happily addicted to Suits! I enjoy all the character & storylines! Great show!!*****<br />Highly recommend buying all seasons!<br />Here's hoping for many more to come!
B00A2IUHM6|2.0|I didn't realize this was a movie I would have to watch online.  I thought it was an actual DVD.
B00EHAIHWM|2.0|After being absent from the music scene for awhile, one would think that they would have time to write better songs.  Sounds very similar to everything else they have.  I love Franz Ferdinand, but this wasn't their best.
0316227706|5.0|Bought several of these last December, along with the calendars, to give out over Christmas. This book is great! If you're a dog lover, you'll literally laugh out loud on about half the pages you turn. The pics are super detailed & clear, and really bring out the expressions in the dogs' faces. One of my co-workers got a berating from his wife on their big, family Christmas day; after opening this, he kept paging through the book & laughing, instead of paying attention to the rest of the family opening presents. :)
1439175640|5.0|i have really enjoyed this cookbook  and would buy again in a heartbeat -- not only great recipies but interesting facts
B0095P31L6|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was written in such a way that the humor would speak to all age groups.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|It's easy to use and It helped me get at least 1 gig more of space on my Kindle Fire
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I never really got into Thor comic books but I think they portrayed him pretty well with this movie. It had great visual effects and the storyline was pretty good. Of course I like everyone else has their own opinion and believe that  they could have improved on movie storyline but overall I liked the one Hollywood went with. If I could give 4-1/2 stars outta five I would have falling short of the &#34;love it&#34; top mark
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game had fun with kids and family hours of entertainment for all of us. It's a must get for you
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Get where you want to go....the first time!  Very clear and concise directions that make it easy to get wherever you want to go.
B00BHBBSZ2|2.0|I needed a simple easy to use notepad, as I had dental surgery and my jaw was very swollen. I had been told not to talk, I found this program difficult to use and became more irritable trying to use it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this bingo game! However, I think they could make it easier to win items. But it's creative and inventive. Something for everyone with all the different rooms and it even has slots. How cool is that? All Bingo lovers will love this game! Must download!
B0090SI4OC|5.0|I loved The Host, but  did not like how it ends.  I how they make more to hook to the ending of this one.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I loved the game,then I bought the newer one,gangster Vegas! It's definitely worth the money,u pay 50$ +for a ps3 or Xbox game.I haven't found any problems,once u get the controls figured out your good to go! The story line isn't to bad neither!
B008PNBU30|5.0|This is my favorite album by this band.  I actually like every single song, which is a compliment that I do not give out easily.  Fantastic listen.  Unfortunately, this band has broken up according to my research.  That is a total shame, because they routinely put out good tunes.  My hope is that they get back together and I can see them live again.  But for a last album, it is a great one.
B000007492|3.0|The used CD case and CD were dirty, like coffee spilled on it, and my favorite song has a blip in it. I love this CD though but kind of surprised it cam so icky.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was reviewed as the John Grisham of old.  It wasn't.  I could see the arc of the book before the halfway point, and was even more disappointed in the last chapter when it all just ended.  Seemed like he got bored about 3/4 of the way through, and just filled in the pages.  Yes, it was an entertaining story line (at first), but I doubt any new author could get this very same book published if they tried.  3 stars is generous.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I could picture the TV show people in this situation and enjoyed the reading.  Nikki  Heat is my favorite  star.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|Great CD, my first from In this Moment.  I will definitely be buying some of their other cds, and hope to see them next month when they come around.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is a fun game that kids would love but the only thing is u have to watch what there diloing.they can buy certain.things.cost.real money and its free
1594744475|5.0|My granddaughters are in to the Bento Box lunches.  They were charmed by the boxes them selves and the cute lunches displayed in them.  We are very happy with the cook book as it gives very clear instructions how to make all the foods and proper presentation of the dishes.  It has moved our pack the lunch time from moans and groans to happiness and adventure.  Suddenly the girls are paying more attention to foods in the store and making healthier choices because they want to make the healthy vegetable etc. stuff in the book.  No more requests for cookies and chips and candy.  We are eating healthier and having more fun in the kitchen putting together these lunches.  Yes it takes a little more time to prepare, but it has become a family activity and I'm not the only one in the kitchen.  We are all planning the lunches and making ahead all we can so not every night is cooking,  Some nights we are just putting up the lunches. All recipes have been very good.
B005CGI3ZG|1.0|The series was missing a disc right in the middle of one of the seasons.  By the time I watched it and realized, it was too late to return.  Also I wasn't even sure if we were allowed to return an open DVD.  Waste of money.
B00EOO55GW|1.0|Well as I suspected with the loss of jimmy \\"the rev\\" Sullivan this is not the same avenged sevenfold on many levels. Now everyone will see just how much influence he had on their albums. The production is great but having said that this album is lame man. The drums as well as song arrangements are pretty basic and boring. Hopefully they come back from this because to me this album is a \\"nightmare\\". plus check out the album cover change that the label made them do. the old one eye of the illuminati who absolutely runs the music industry. good luck listen before you buy because this album isn't all that boys and girls.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|It's been years since an album smacked me with such nostalgic force as did \\"After the Gold Rush.\\"  Granted, this music showcases Neil Young's plaintive singing.  It's of a certain period:  basic beats and poignant riffs linked to sentimental, romantic lyrics.  Music has moved so far beyond the issue date 40 plus years ago when these tunes were so special.  Baby boomers should rejoice that these songs are still available.  As long as good memories persist, I plan to play it incessantly. \\"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere\\"  goes well with this one.
B005LJITS0|3.0|I liek the Green Lantern theme but the movie seemed short of plot and kind of fell flat in the end.
030759565X|5.0|I ADORE the Smitten Kitchen blog and could not resist owning a copy of the SK Cookbook. I love it. I've tried out several recipes and have not found a fault with any of them. It's a great cookbook to have in your kitchen. I highly recommend it. You are guaranteed to make something delicious if you use Deb Perelman's recipes!
B00DWZHTRW|2.0|I truly was hoping I would like this based on the number of positive reviews. However this movie failed my eye roll test in literally seconds. It smacks of lazy writing and poor characterization. For example, imagine if in trying to convey that a character the author had created was famous, people walking by the main character would stop and say \\"hey! you're a famous!\\" that's how lazy the writing is. And then Morgan Freeman shows up and my eyes rolled yet again. Hey guys like Morgan Freeman? Then you'll love it when he's in every movie! See! Now he's not special anymore! It's great!<br /><br />I was hoping to at least get some cool magic or practical effects. Nope- this movie actually uses computer graphics and special effects! Does anyone grasp how dumb that is? When a magician in the movie is eaten by piranhas to the shock of the crowd, and the piranhas are cheesy computer graphics, is anyone at home supposed to be intrigued or impressed? Oh she didn't actually die....you don't say. Oh she was in the crowd...you don't say. Oh look the crowd is losing its mind cheering, she must be a great magician. Even the card tricks performed are ones that I remembered from seeing friends do in elementary school. Basically- instead of writing intelligent characters or actually using cool magic tricks in the movie- the writers just made everybody else in the film completely clueless. Oh and the dialogue- including the \\"witty\\" banter, is petty and totally devoid of chemistry.<br /><br />The Prestige this is not. Even Burt Wonderstone this is not. PAAAAASS
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Three families, three separate lives,but they all have one common secret.  Liane Moriarty takes you into their worlds by weaving a story of tragedy, love and forgiveness??  I enjoyed her character development and plotline.  It is a mystery story and a love story as well.  I will definitely read other selections by this author.  I hope you like this book as much as I did.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if your a horse lover than you have to purchase this free app. I hope you can have as much fun as me.
B00AEBB8H4|5.0|This is a wonderful Blu-ray of a perfect film, it's top notch, the colors pop. The details are sharp<br />and it only enhances the already wonderful performances and flawless directing.<br />This is a MUST for any Hitchcock/Grant fan to own! One of my favorite films, if you love style and romance, excess, wit, charm and drama To Catch A Thief is what it's all about.<br />The Brosnan version of The Thomas Crown Affair and Before The Sunset all pay tribute to To Catch A Thief, the original stylish thriller. For me Pierce Brosnan will always be today's generation Carry Grant. I so wish someone with balls and of course a good directing and editing sense would redo or at least pay homage to To Catch A Thief with Pierce Brosnan in the lead.<br />This film with Carry Grant and Grace Kelly can never be replaced but it can be enjoyed by a new generation. Like The Great Gatsby with DiCaprio sometimes a new version must be made for people to discover how great the original is. I do consider the Baz Luhrmann Gastby superior to the Redford version but I love both and would love to see Lurhmann do a new take on TCAT but at the same time I realize that no one would be able to surpass the genius of Alfred Hitchcock. What I love about this movie beyond the style, sophistication and great actors/characters is the irreverence. Here Grant and Kelly play in a playland of money and power and intrigue. The show Remington Steel so reminds me of To Catch A Thief and it's no coincidence that in the pilot episode when Stephanie Zimbalist finds a load of various passports in Pierce Brosnan's hotel room they are under the names of characters Carry Grant played in the movies and among them is John Robie.<br />To Catch A Thief is very different from most of Hitchcock's films, it's a very tight story with high style and more fun than drama or thrills or horror. It's a classic far above and beyond most films made today and the Blu-ray is a flawless image of a flawless classic film.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|My knives are never as dull as they once were and that terrible task of lining up the kitchen knives and pulling out the sharpening stone is no more. Seriously, this thing is very handy.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Awesome game great graphics anytime I'd be doing the puzzles if someone walked by and glanced at my kindle they ended up asking to give it a shot great game
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|A quick note:<br /><br />For the previous Avenged album (\\"Nightmare\\"), I spent days on the review and it wound up being more of a memoir than a review. By the time I posted it, nobody saw it and if I remember correctly, it only got one vote. So I will not be making that mistake again. This review will be quick. But if you want to see an in-depth look on how I feel about the band's previous records, check that review out.<br /><br />So basically what critics and down right haters seem to say about A7X is \\"herp a derp they suck. they aint metal\\". Well that line of reasoning is gone, as this album is pure metal, and very good metal at that.<br /><br />Don't make a mistake though. I am not immediately labeling every person that dislikes the band as a \\"hater.\\" I'm just saying that one idiotic line of reasoning lost all the validity it never had with this album. If you post a poor review here, fine. Just have a valid explanation. Some of the decent critical reviews I have read state that the album's arrangements are basic and boring. Fair enough. An explanation I disagree with is better than no explanation at all. What strikes me as ironic is that up until this point, the majority of negative reviews have not come from \\"haters\\" but disappointed fanboys, which is the opposite of the way it was with \\"Nightmare\\".<br /><br />___________________<br /><br />The Album:<br /><br />So as for the album itself, it is the definition of \\"solid\\". To me this album is everything that City of Evil should have been (if you read my Nightmare review, you would see that I am highly critical of City of Evil). This album has all the influences that were present in that album (Metallica, Guns n' Roses, Iron Maiden), but this one is much more deliberate, polished and complete. You can tell how much the band, and Matt in particular, have grown from CoE. His vocals have improved astronomically (at this point he is easily one of the top voices in modern rock. Listen to This Means War for evidence, in addition to his outstanding live sound). Another place where he has improved by a huge margin is in his writing ability. I dont know if he received advice/help from somebody or if he has just grown with experience, but this is by far the most well written Avenged album yet. The lack of influence from the deceased Rev -who was a great writer- left me concerned about how the writing for this album would be. Now I feel like an idiot.<br /><br />This album is without a single \\"bad\\" track, and it also has a couple standouts. \\"This Means War\\" is one, \\"Doing Time\\" is another. Ironically (probably the wrong word), the most generic song on the album is probably it's title track, so if all you heard was \\"Hail to the King\\", it only gets better from there.<br /><br />So in conclusion, is this album a masterpiece like Waking the Fallen? No. There are no \\"Second Heartbeats\\" and \\"I Wont See You Tonights\\" on this album. Is it a great album, better than the self titled, City of Evil, and maybe even Sounding the Seventh Trumpet? Yes, definitely. It seems like Avenged has completely ditched their experimental side and is completely back in the right direction. I am confident that if people who were objectively not fans of their last albums come into this album with an open mind, they will enjoy it. As for current fans, the only way I can see you being disappointed is if you for some reason can't deal with the fact they have a new drummer (as if they had a choice), or if they are disappointed in the lack of screamed vocals, which is more understandable. After the band released \\"God Hates Us\\" with the last album and Matt started screaming more live, I thought we were in for more with this album. For the most part, no such luck. Still, this album is very good.<br /><br />1) Waking the Fallen (5/5)<br />2) Nightmare (4/5)<br />3) Hail to the King (3.5/5)<br />3) Sounding the Seventh Trumpet (3.5/5)<br />4) Avenged Sevenfold (3/5)<br />5) City of Evil (2.5/5)
B007OWRBJK|4.0|An interesting retrospective look at Pete's life with and without The Who.  Pete shares an amazing amount of detail of his life (how does he remember all that) and is very honest about himself, strengths and weaknesses. I liked it and I think you will too.
1609611543|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It caused me to re- evaluate my diet and make positive changes! No more wheat for me!
B000LXQVA4|5.0|FIrst of all, it was pretty easy for me to assemble. Once we put my son in it, he just started jumping! He jumps and jumps and is always smiling. Sometimes he stares at the animals and tries to grab them.<br />He always tried to pull himself up so I decided to buy a jumperoo. I'm thankful I bought this one and would gladly recommend it to others.
B005LF9IO8|4.0|You don't see to many children that can act like this. She is up there with Angelina Jo lee from salt, and the other movie don't know her name but it was the lady from Columbiana movie. If you saw those you would also love this.
B00DMKFN34|4.0|Rating the Movie more than this edition due to edition not released yet.<br />Fun addition to the Cars series and can't wait to see in 3D Blu-ray.<br />Great way to show true sportsmanship and relationships develop of being yourself.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Transfer respects the lightning and texture the director originally wanted for the image.<br />Just a small, nice amount of extras.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The forecasts are usually correct, but the first page is too busy and difficult to read.  The maps are okay, but hard to get to the one I need.  It does seem to use up the battery pretty quickly so I usually remove it from my device until I need it.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|We watched it in preparation for despicable me 2. Great fun! Love the minions, Gru and the girls. Enjoy it!
B00915G6MG|5.0|Great series that you can watch over and over and enjoy them all each time.<br />Great writers and believable cast interaction.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|This is one of the better puzzle games that I have played.  It really keeps your interest and even though some puzzles are repeated the increased difficulty of them keeps this game interesting.  I would not be happy if Azada 2 contained repetitive puzzles.<br /><br />The bottom line with this app is that the puzzles are challenging and you really want to complete the game so you can figure out how the guy got locked in the picture.<br /><br />However, there was a lack of a significant ending and that was a huge disappointment after spending several hours completing the puzzles.  This coupled with the fact that there was a glitch in one of the hidden object puzzles which required me to use an orb to complete it is the reason I rated this app with three stars<br /><br />Your mileage may vary as this is just my opinion.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Just as I remember it living in the deep south in the mid-seventies. It is amazing how far we have come since that time.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Alecia Moore gets her P!nk on all throughout I'm Not Dead. It hits such emotional resonance that it astounds the senses and leaves the listener feeling fulfilled and touched. It's quite rare for an artist to accomplish this, even less so in the pop world. P!nk tackles subjects such as loss, rape, homelessness and depression to name a few, and packages it all in a pop-rock romp that screams \\"I'm Not Dead!\\"<br /><br />P!nk is explosive through the sassy numbers like \\"'Cuz I Can,\\" an album highlight (\\"My rims are 23-inch/and they're black-on-black/No, they're not his.\\") and blazing single \\"U + Ur Hand\\" (\\"Don't touch/back up/I'm not the one/buh-bye\\"). The darker, more heart-wrenching pieces grab at you in a different but equally effective way. Rock ballad \\"Nobody Knows\\" is classic P!nk, offering a taste of her penchant for Zeppelin in the album's best and most haunting vocals (\\"Nobody cares/It's win or lose, not how you play the game/and the road to darkness has a way of always knowing my name\\").<br /><br />If I had to describe I'm Not Dead in a word, I'd say \\"emotional\\" - because whether she's high or low on this album, she makes you feel it. Great album from the quirky, witty, immeasurably talented P!nk.
B008JFUP0I|4.0|Action Packed and a varied cast to help keep you entertained throughout the whole film.<br />It was awesome seeing unbelievable stunts look believable.<br />Very good sequel in a continuing series.<br />Love the variety of vehicles used in this one.<br />Can't wait to see in Blu-ray.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|worst movie I've seen in a long long long time. The only thing going for it was the makeup, allowing the actors to embody characters through time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. I play it all the time and I never have any problems with it. This app rocks! I give it 5 stars.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I just love all the choices of sounds and tones you are giving . I use the app every night to relax and fall asleep.
B00DD49R0E|4.0|Rating the Movie more than this edition due to edition not released yet.<br />Great twists throughout to maintain attention and laughter.<br />Little purple guys were wild.<br />Should be very good in 3D blu-ray.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Some interesting action scenes (hooray for a Rated R Die Hard flick!), but Bruce Willis just doesn't have the energy he had in the best flick of the series (Die Hard 3). The end is just way over the top (bordering on boring), and the 'family dynamic' just feels forced. If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest waiting until the flick is in the dollar bin
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a truly wonderful book. John green has done it again, managing to have a great plot but an ending I wish was different.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is awesome. It is so much fun. Kids and adults alike will enjoy this game.<br /> Keeps you busy for hours!
B00E00PM40|4.0|Rating the actual Movie more than this edition because its not released yet.<br />This was a entertaining and humorous film for all ages. It implies you can achieve great things if you don't give up.<br />Bright vivid animation. Can't wait to see on Blu-ray.
B005HF0GMA|5.0|This show is spellbinding. The characters are fascinating in their roles. The plots are intriguing. I can't stop watching these episodes.
0062255657|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is just a fantastic book. He blends classic fairy tale elements into the book, combined with solid characters.  Cannot wait for the sequel!
B004XISI4A|5.0|I really like this book it's kept me hooked for quite along time I recommend it to anyone who likes war books or fantasy books buy it in ebook form as it is really long and hard to read in paperback
B008QE9XD2|5.0|johnny depp fan -very versatile actor -liked this film very much-but i also liked the Dark shadows TV series- ,just one more film to add to JD's hit list
030758836X|4.0|I give this a four-1/2 star review.  The three parts in the novel separated things.  Finished the first part; started the second and before I knew it I was ...wowed!  So, the novel changed and so did the characters.  It was like starting a new book with new characters.  The mystery treasure \\"anniversary' hunt kept me flipping the pages.  The end.........stung me.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I'm a huge Avenged Sevenfold fan and this album doesn't dissapoint! If you grew up listening to Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth and Guns n Roses you're gonna love this one. You can tell the band uses those 4 bands in particular as influences in these songs. If you heard the Hail To The King single and liked it you'll be happy as I believe every other song on the album is better than the single. A+++
B00BKTFABE|1.0|Great camera if you like pics of yourself. How are you supposes to aim it?. What more can I say?
B00701QRI6|5.0|The little lady and I were at the Park City, Park Silly Sunday Market. There was a very good cover band that did an excellent job of \\"No One To Depend On\\", had to get it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Okay is a reference to this more than \\"okay\\" love story and not the quality of the story. The story is actually a beautiful one. I became caught up in it's subtlety and isn't it as most love stories happen...girl meets boy, boy stares at girl, boy and girl fall in love. Only these characters aren't regular...far from it.<br /><br />Both Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters have cancer (at least some form of it at various times) who meet at a support group. Their spheres of living are small and they are drawn to each other. One reviewer marked that they aren't like regular teenagers and they're right. It is easy to get lost in the venacular just like it was back when Dawson's Creek first started but even that becomes easy to forget as you become more deeply invested in these characters individually and as a couple.<br /><br />I thought I would easily finish this book without shedding one tear but I was completely wrong!! Love and death demand emotion and emotion is what this book gave me. The sadness of tragedy and loss; knowing that we are all grenades waiting to go off, planets ready to explode.<br /><br />I finished the book wanting these two characters to be real and I'm so glad the author did not end the way An Imperial Affliction ended!! I would have written the author, much like Hazel did demanding answers!<br /><br />Now, I ask myself what book can follow this one? It's the type of book that needs a couple of days to get over the pain; to let my heart mend before starting another journey with new characters who aren't Augustus and Hazel.<br /><br />This is a wonderful, heart rending book about sickness, life, loss and love. The only way after this book is UP.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I bought Mahjong II, played all the games, and liked it so well I went back and bought the first edition. Games are graduated in difficulty and keep you interested.
B001M72JC2|1.0|This is one of my favorite movies. For most movies, the director's cut is a little better. THIS director's cut is horrible. It has an alternate ending which is absolutely horrible. A fetus deliberately strangling himself just before birth. Awful, awful, awful. If you have already seen the director's cut, you are probably so soured that going back and watching the theatrical cut won't make that much difference at this point. Everyone who got the disk hates this movie because they went straight to the director's cut. If you saw the theatrical cut first, it is an awesome show.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Can anyone see a set of congas and NOT think of the intro to Waiting!!! Had access to this initially on vinyl when I first started to appreciate the array of music I now enjoy. This is one for the ages.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|I am so glad I started watching.  Very addicting.  Great great show .  I hate for it to end.  Great people in it too. Must see !!
B009NQLT0M|5.0|I bought this to install in an overheating wireless router. The packaging was overkill and it was a bit more expensive than other fans, but it works beautifully and I can't hear it running at all.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I wish I had all this information in one place (this is in this very, very well documented book) when I was in ministerial school.  I had to read the material from many indiviual sources!  It is a well researched, easy to read biography of Historical Jesus of Nazareth. It is the facts of the political climate of the times in  history when he lived. It is actually an enjoyable  read for anyone interested in history/orgins of realigions. While no one knows for certain what the real truth is, one can draw some educated, thought provoking conclusions of who this man was and how/why he indeed is very important in the evolution of spiritual beliefs.<br /><br />I bought the book for my Kindle AND then bought hard copy so I could research events, etc I am interested in by underlining, and accessing some the full the documents cited easily.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I loved this book! Neil Gaiman paints tangible, vivid pictures with words. This book took me back to my own childhood, when magic is still believable. This book should be read slowly to savor the beautifully crafted prose.  This is one to read more than once!
B00640UICA|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game, for everyone from my 4yo to myself.  It has cute graphics and is easy to understand, simply join hands.  Each alien has his own rules: whether he can be moved or not, if he holds hands with anyone, only his same buddies, or likes to be alone.  When everyone is happy you advance to the next level.  My 4yo can handle most of them, but doesn't achieve the star bonus, that is what makes it more challenging without being too difficult.  You don't HAVE to have an alien covering the stars, just as long as everyone is happy!  It sure keeps my family happy!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Lots of fun!  Quick and easy to use. Would be fun for kids and adults.<br />Can get hooked real fast. Great game I it all the time.
1401938906|3.0|Just finished the first experiment.....Did not get any kind of 'blessing' that was obviously from the Force. A cashier didn't charge me for an item, my friend gave me some vitamins. Not really anything super fantastic.....any clue as to why it didn't work?

0375869026|4.0|I think that kids from 6th grade to 9th grade would like this book the best because they are close to August's age.  They can also relate to going into a new school like August and not knowing anyone else at school.  He felt worried, strange and scared at different levels.  He was worried about what people would think of his looks.  He felt strange being the only new kid and he felt scared people would make fun of him.  Although not everyone liked him he succeeded by making new friends.  If someone like August can succeed in a new school  then he will give others confidence that they can succeed too.  The book was powerful and good because it helps others be more confident.  I was excited because August succeeded at making friends and not being picked on by others.  It meant a lot to me because it showed me anyone can overcome fear like August did.  I thought it was cool how the characters had unique names like Summer, August, Miles and Charlotte.  I also liked how I got to hear the story from their point of view.  One of the best parts of the story was at the end when Miles, Jack, Amos and Henry stood up for him when some older kids from another school were trying to bully him.  That part made me feel good because it showed the power of friendship.  I hope that I can rely on my friends in that situation.  I really liked the book because I could relate to the characters and the situations they experienced.  I did not think this book was good...I thought it was great!
B000NMW6M0|1.0|I feel there was a parts in it the movie that did not need to be there, I was not able to watch but 2 min. of the movie it was very bad and distasteful
1848581777|5.0|As a collector of all things Dickens, I have many books of A Christmas Carol.  When I received this book, I was a bit disapponted because some pages were torn, but Amazon quickly rectified by picking up the damaged book and sending a replacement. The illustrations are lovely, and I so appreciate the guilded edges and the small size of this book.  Many may feel the print is too small, and though I agree it may be  difficult reading for most, I purchased this more as a keepsake and addition to my collection of this beloved classic.  A true treasure, and I am thrilled with this purchase!
B0028INIWE|5.0|Good stuff..just what you would expect from the dead....good song...good recordings...its not as good as listning to a full show but great for those not as knowledgeably in deep dead songs
B006O6F4O6|1.0|My adult son is a huge fan of Batman. He was very disappointed with the poor quality and it did not come in the original package from the manufacturer as stated and pictured. I purchashed this for my son as a treat for his work promotion from Police Officer to Detective and boy was I let down.
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|This movie is still good even after more than twenty years - a classic.  Super suspenseful - never gets old.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The movie was okay.  The story could have been developed better and gone a little deeper into the characters.  A little too scary for my younger children.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|Has tasks on a timer that keep you entertained. More difficult as you go to keep you going and a great story line.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|It a great way if u wanna dj nd it shows if u wanna change a different type of setting i was lookin for a app like this
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Love it!! Best game ever!! I look forward to playing everday! A day without candy crush would be like a day without sunshine!! My 3 sisters and I enjoy playing especially becsuse we can see each others level. Some levels are very challenging but we are determined to go all the way!! If there is an end we hope to reach it soon. :-). I normally lose interest in games after s few weeks; but not Candy Crush! I will definitely need to check in at the Candy Crush Rehabilitation Center soon!! Hahahaha!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book was totally fascinating.  How the author crafted the story from the different perspectives of each character.  I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a well crafted epic.
B00E5Q1HJS|2.0|The HD playback on the purchased DVD was not the quality I expected.  Amazon lagged during playback and caused distortion and pixelation through out the whole experience.  We have optimum Wifi and never have problems gaming online or streaming movies from other sources.  This is the first movie purchase through Amazon and will also be our last. :( sorry amazon.
1876825545|5.0|Could not say enough of how Mich i enjoyed this book. Not the biggest of readers but pounded this book out in less than a week!
0345529057|5.0|I love this book set. I just can't stop reading them and really like being able to read them all in a row by buying them as a set.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|Absolutely loved &#34;Medium&#34; when it aired, and was so excited to see all the seasons available on Amazon.  Hopefully my family will keep these DVD's coming until I have them all!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It will keep you busy all day, you cannot stop. I wish for part 2 will come soon.  . Can't wait.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|This is a sweet film with gorgeous special effects. Franco in the lead is excellent, as are most of the other actors/voice-over actors in the film. It is a prequel to the original, although the two don't actually match up all that well. The story is good, the dialogue is good, and it is a very enjoyable film. The only things that really bothered me were having two evil witches (sisters), which seemed unnecessary and a bit confused, plus I thought the sister who played the green witch/Margaret Hamilton role, was a poor choice for the role. Her acting wasn't up to the part, and the look they gave her just didn't strike the right chord with me; I found her irritating.<br /><br />Otherwise, I enjoyed the film and would recommend it.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I bought the Pulse after having received two Jawbone Ups, neither of which I could get to sync with my phone. The Pulse works well and records steps and sleep as it should. It also measures your heart rate, but this involves several seconds with it placed on your finger, not a continuous reading like chest monitors. Syncing with my phone is a doddle, although it hasn't yet automatically synced, I've had to do it manually but that could be down to the way my phone sleeps. The phone and web apps are very clear and easy to understand. There are a few oddities, however. One is the altitude measurement, which is a bit hit and miss. I'm doing some DIY on my house and up and down stairs all day. After the first few climbs it had only registered 1m altitude gain, when I had been up and down the 2.5m stairs half a dozen times. Over the weekend sometimes it would record several metres gained in half an hour but sometimes none for hours at a time. Also, my daily walk involves descending into a river valley and up the other side. Then I retrace my steps. On the outward leg it records a height gain of several metres, varies from day to day, but coming back it records zero. There are also some discrepancies between the phone app and the web app when it comes to level of intensity. Yesterday, for example, the phone showed no high intensity but the web app showed 5mins. The day before the phone showed 2mins, the web 5mins again. The thing I bought the Jawbone Up for that is missing from the Pulse is an inactivity alarm. They say it's not a 'yet' a feature, which may mean they will add this later in an update. But achieving 10,000 steps a day means there's little time for being inactive!
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I thought the book was very well written.  Since I enjoyed it so much, I read her other book as well.
0307887448|5.0|1. Some good science fiction has a bold vision for the future, that's maybe beautiful or ugly but always thought provoking, like \\"Blade Runner\\" or \\"Minority Report\\".<br /><br />2. Other works use an extreme vision of the future primarily to comment on the present, like \\"District 9\\".<br /><br />3. Others still are written, not by your typical author types, but by scientists and engineers with technical dreams about the boundaries of what will soon be possible. The best examples, like those by Jules Verne, or Wehrer von Braun's \\"Das Marsprojekt\\", go on to inspire future engineers, and the dreams go on to become reality.<br /><br />Ready Player One is an amazing book that succeeds in all three ways:<br /><br />1. The OASIS metaverse is wildly imaginative and beautiful, and certainly thought-provoking.<br /><br />2. The book's \\"real world\\" -- the world OASIS players escape from every time they put on their haptic gloves and visors -- is a work of satire, a caricature the world we live in today. The implied criticism of our current governments and corporations feels very valid.<br /><br />3. Finally, Ernest Cline is a virtual reality visionary. Maybe he goes a bit overboard on some details, but like Verne and the others, a lot of things that exist today only in his imagination will exist in reality soon. I'm an engineer and computer programmer; I've played Minecraft, I've played MMOs, and I've written software for the Oculus Rift. (Side note: if you get a chance to use an Oculus before you read this book, do it! It's worth it.)<br /><br />The notion that you can put on a visor and enter a new world---not just on a glowing rectangle, but at least visually all around you---and hang out, not just with a few gamers, but with some fraction of all humans---and that, together, you can build a world that's in some ways more fun than the real world---is not mere fantasy. It's the future.
B007TR1R22|2.0|I was completely shocked at how badly \\"The Deep Blue Sea\\" was edited.  It was mainly a series of vignettes mainly to showcase the beauty of the actors and the sets/costumes.  No care was given to any proper storytelling.<br /><br />The lack of congruity between scenes was off putting.  It was even further exacerbated by the excruciatingly slow pacing of the film.  I read one of the previous reviews<br />before watching and they mentioned the only the beginning was slow.  I have to disagree and write that the ENTIRE film was.<br /><br />Considering that I'm a big fan of Rachel Weisz and Tom Hiddleston, I was disappointed with this film and these two actors are the only reason I watched it to the end.<br />Movies like \\"The End of the Affair\\" and \\"Waterloo Bridge\\" have a similar themes and also set in World War II.  I'd recommend watching them instead.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|I have a four year old grand daughter. That loves this game. She also loves the music. At bedtime she listens to the music and falls asleep holding kindle.
B0073PZIBQ|1.0|It was too difficult to find our tv info to get the movie to work properly.  We rented the non HD version instead.  We have a compatible tv...don't know why we couldn't get it to formulate correctly.  believe that we should be reimbursed for this movie as we had to rent the non HD version right after.
B004PGO25O|4.0|I'm not a writer, but I am a musician and a business owner, and this was a very insightful, thought provoking book. I'd recommend it to anyone who is thinking about trying something new and looking for a little research.
0399255370|5.0|Not only do I love this book, so does my spouse, daughter, son and grandaughter! It is a very nice book. The red crayon is a bit scary, but just right for a 4 year old.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|the game is a brain teaser &amp; I like how it keeps you thinking! I have terrible memory, I think it helps me!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|big numbers,  easy to use, great variety in audio..<br /><br />good alternative to an alarm clock..<br /><br />free your desk or night table with this app in you kindle.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|i really don't like signing talking, acting terrific - very good, but in all it wasn't the movie for me, I was just curious<br />that I bought it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the second book I read by this wonderful author.  I recommend his books to anyone that appreciates good writing.  His writing has a way of allowing me to feel what his characters are feeling.  Very emotional and touching stories.
B008NA2JMQ|5.0|This book was recommended  to me by a well read friend. I was a little reluctant, but as the movie is due for release soon too, I thought it could not be that bad.<br />It is like a real life Jackie Collins type book with balls. It hits you hard and fast and you cannot even begin to imagine what is coming up next. The real shocking aspect of it is that it is based on this man's life! It seriously gives you some insight into the 'rich and disfunctional' and I think it sends a lot of positive messages out to.<br />If you are not averse to profanity and crassness - this book will really take you on a ride. I hope the movie does it justice.<br />And I have thanked my friend for the recommendation of a book I gloriously devoured over two weeks (it would of been less if I had not been distracted by my other half, lol).
B00CJKW4WQ|5.0|Just received this item today and I must say - I absolutely love it!  The design is very nice and actually looks like it was made by Apple.  Pairing the device to my MacBook Air was exceptionally easy and only took a couple seconds.  Love the functionality of being able to switch back and forth between calculator mode and number pad mode, it makes inputting data effortless and efficient.  I am hoping this will last me a very long time.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and would highly recommend this item.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|I have been hooked on this movie since the first time I saw it 30 years ago, it's great fun
081297381X|5.0|This book was recommended by a good friend and we have it ready to read next.<br />Thanks for making it available!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Not sure what all the hype is about but I couldn't even bring myself to finish this overhyped trash. It reminds me of Judy Blume books I read in puberty but with an s & m element. This book really did not appeal to me in any way but obviously the masses disagree.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Everytime I tried to install it would freeze on me and I asked a friend to try it thinking it's my phone but nope it did not work for her either.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|definitely worth the short moment it took to download and install. fun to play and watch all the neat things going on.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app seems to do the job. It's easy to use. I hate trying to figure out complicated apps. I had no problems with this one.
0399157565|1.0|I used to absolutely love Kay Scarpetta.  I really tried to like this.  Usually if I have trouble getting into a book I'll try to listen to it on CD.  It didn't work this time.  All I hear is whining on Kay's part.  She complains a lot and never does anything about it.  I got through two CDs and returned it to my library.  So glad I didn't waste my money on this one!
B0063IH60K|4.0|wish I could talk to the person I am playing against. Other then that I really love this game = addictive
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this series.  I had no idea it was even on and now I am hooked.  I am finally into session 2...just a couple more to go!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After reading the sad sack reviews that some people have written, saying they were disappointed in the ending, I wondered what the hell is wrong? It's NOT the end. This was never marketed as a trilogy. It's called the Crossfire Series which means here will be more than one. It's never been called the Crossfire Trilogy. Maybe that's what sets it apart from the whole Fifty Shades comparison people keep making. It's not Fifty Shades and tells a whole different story. I was overjoyed that there will be more because Sylvia does an excellent job telling the story of how two survivors can fit to make a whole. I can't wait for the next installment!!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is arguably the best show on TV and Amazon delivers a huge deal with HD quality full-length seasons to watch anytime!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|graphics are awesome, one of the best I've seen on a phone. Huge game, takes up a lot of space though.
B000TERG6S|5.0|I have become addicted to this music.  I wanted something to listen to while resting in the afternoon.  I couldn't be more perfect.  He is so talented and the pieces he selects are just right for meditation.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Want to believe in humanity again? Watch this movie. Witty, sweet, humorous, well-crafted. Watch with wine and cheese, all iPhones/iPads/Androids in the off position!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The best show on TV is back better than ever in full HD! Suits fans must check out the amazing quality and convenience that Amazon provides!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I recently bought this movie through Amazon, and watched it at least 3-4 times during a week and a half stretch while I was on vacation from work. Everyone in this movie was superbly cast. It was Fun and interesting to watch and see how the House of Representatives voted and passed an amendment to the Constitution back during Lincoln's presidency. This movie was Truly Fun and entertaining. I very highly recommend this movie for everyone.<br /><br />Derek
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think Dragon Story is perfect for kids, because I am one. Also perfect for anyone who likes or loves dragons.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Excellent quality with new songs, both live and studio version CD's.  Concert DVD is rare performance by original members of this band.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Who doesn't love Tina Fey?  Her book is poignant, smart and so funny. Caution if you plan to read this book in public. I was laughing so hard I had tears running down my face.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The story is entertaining and the book is an easy read but many of the plot &#34;twists&#34; seemed telegraphed far in advance.  I never really cared for the main characters as much as the author intended but surprisingly this did not take away from my enjoyment of the story.  I did enjoy the descriptions and depictions of the criminal justice and jury trial system.  They were accurately explained in an interesting way.  I would recommend the book to anyone interested in legal or crime fiction and family dramas.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|You should read the book first.  They definitely had to cut a lot to make it fit into a season and to make the plots move along faster, but the show stands by itself.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This movie was so funny. I rented it 3 times and laughed more each time. It is spot on when it comes to pregnancy symptoms and how different each pregnancy is. I myself have 4 children and all pregnancies were different. Loved the cast and script!<br />This one is worth your time!
0316228583|2.0|This book was so dreary I could not read it all the way thru.  It would be very nice if she would write something as livly as her Harry Potter books.
B00985E3UG|4.0|This book is a must-read for anyone concerned about what they are putting into their bodies.  Moss' background as an investigative reporter is fully evident upon reading this book.  He has gained access and interviewed many of the key players in the processed food industry, including the food scientists who engineer foods to provide consumers with the most addictive foods that are utterly bereft of nutritional value.<br /><br />Even for those who realize how engineered the food we eat today is, this book will be an eye opener.  I would have given the book 5 stars but for the fact that while Moss presents so much damning evidence against the multinational corporations who peddle unhealthy foods to kids at every turn, he falls short of ultimately condemning  the practices he so expertly describes.  Perhaps that was beyond the scope of his book or perhaps it was the price he had to pay for gaining access to the people he needed to talk to.  Notwithstanding this minor quibble, the book is excellent and should be required reading for anyone struggling with an addiction to unhealthy foods.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|I loved the first two books in this series.  This one was not very good though.  It was very different that the prior books and the lame subplots just don't add anything to the overall story line.  The ending was terrible and sets the reader up for a fourth book.  If the next book is as bad as this one, I'll pass.
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|Totally LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS BOOK now I need another one to read as I have gone through all of them!!!
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I actually bought the book on a whim because it was 99 cents and not a long read.. What I found was it really is a way of looking at how to declutter, but with an approach that really pushes you to look at what your life can be like without a lot of \\"stuff\\".<br /><br />It is almost monastic in its approach, but I found that there were certain things she wrote that really had me thinking: 1. - If there was a disaster, could you just quickly leave and not worry about what you leave behind, and 2. If you were away from home and your house was robbed (happened to her), would there be anything worth stealing or worrying about. It is looking at life in a way that forces you to see what is really important and useful in your life.<br /><br />But it is not a book about denying yourself, but about what do you really use and what is really essential in your life. She writes about what worked for her and her husband, but she knows what was essential to them may be different for someone else. I realized that in some areas she was a little too minimalist for my tastes, but in others I felt that it was a little too much because I didn't find the items essential. So, it really is about evaluating what is \\"minimalist\\" for you.<br /><br />It is more philosophical in decluttering with examples of small changes she made in her own life, but they are her strategies and may or may not work for you. The strength of the book is in changing your mindset when it comes to living a minimalist lifestyle.<br /><br />I recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It's a cliche to call Stephen King the master of horror.  It also sells short his many talents.  I enjoy his non-horror/thriller work (Shawshank and The Green Mile) just as much as his standard fare.  11/22/63 is no exception.  Other than the Back to the Future Trilogy, OK just the first two, I am not a huge fan of time travel stories but King gets it right on every level here.  People like to think that going back in time to right a wrong, or make a few bucks gambling on sports, would be great...if only we could perfect it.  King however explores the unintended consequences of messing with the past and trying to prevent the assassination of JFK.  Would we be better off to let things happen as they are meant to happen?  Are things meant to happen in any specific way at all?  Can even the slightest change in the past change the future of a person, town, country, or humankind?  These are just some of the questions raised by King in this thought-provoking and thoroughly engrossing story.  Stephen King provides the perfect mix of sci-fi, historical fiction, and morality tale in this gripping novel about the power of change.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love discovering new authors with new points of view who can write stories that totally immerse you in their world. Hugh doesn't disappoint. How am I supposed to get any work done with all these good books?! On to the Shift Omnibus!
1881273873|2.0|This book was in good condition, but it was not the edition that it states it is supposed to be. I was a little disappointed by that because sometimes they will update it.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|This album truly is \\"Another Self Portrait\\".  The unreleased tracks from the Self Portrait sessions are stunning and the tracks from the Nashville Skyline and New Morning sessions are added bonuses.  \\"Pretty Saro\\" and \\"Railroad Bill\\" are two of the many standouts on this amazing album.  Another incredible volume of The Bootleg Series.  Thank you Columbia Records & Bob Dylan!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is my second reading of this awesome book.  It was just as great as the first!<br />Thank you Enzo for sharing your version of life.  Four-legged friends are the greatest!

B0012GTZC0|5.0|Great thriller, absolute page turner of the highest order. Thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't mind being kept awake all night devouring a master story.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A friend of mine kept telling me I wouldn&#34;t be able to put a Vince Flynn book down once I started it. He was right! So much so that now I am backtracking to his previous novels and started American Assasin which portrays the beginnings of Mitch Rapp. I usually read nonfiction books but I will have to get my fix of Mitch Rapp before I go back!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|You can't beat the price if you need this to do something that some other device you have can't, but for most folks this will add nothing to their Home Theater system they don't already have.<br /><br />This device is good for streaming Netflix, YouTube, Google Music, Google Play Movies/TV, and if you use Chrome Browser on your laptop or computer, it attempts to stream any media in a tab, but it doesn't do that too well (in beta, ya know).<br /><br />If you already have a Roku, TiVo, Google TV, PS3, Apple TV, XBox, or even a recent Smart TV then the only thing this device will do that a couple of those won't is stream your Google Play Music/Movies/TV.<br /><br />The interface is unique and simple for Android phone owners.  Install the Chromecast app on your phone and it scans the network for the Chromecast device, then it lets you &#34;cast&#34; the YouTube/Netflix/whatever to the television.  The streaming is handled by the Chromecast over its own network connection, but the phone is used as the remote control.  Just control the video stream on the phone the same way you always have, but the video on the TV is controlled.  I actually found this more tedious than just using a remote control for my GoogleTV/TiVo/PanasonicVT50 apps.<br /><br />After the initial, wow, a cool new, very affordable Google product enthusiasm wore off, I found myself not using this anymore and just went back to the GoogleTV for playing YouTube and the host of other useful things like PodCast apps that it offers.  Perhaps when the Chromecast adds some more features it will be useful for those who aren't already connected with some other much more capable device.<br /><br />I did find one small usefulness for one of my three Chromecasts:  I had an HDMI-compatible 1080P 24&#34; computer monitor I wasn't using.  I plugged the Chromecast into it and now can play some limited videos on it, but with no way to hook up external speakers, it needs to be in a quiet room.
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|I saw \\"Kick-Ass 2\\" twice in the movie theaters because I just had too. Kick-Ass 2 is a lot more fun than the first because it had a lot more action but it also had good dialogue. Though I was a bit disappointed with how they used Hit-Girl in this movie but I guess the writers wanted to soften her up a bit. Enjoyed the super-hero group \\"Justice Forever\\" and the super-villains \\"Toxic Mega C@$T\\", especially \\"Mother Russia.\\" The movie is filled with excitement and a lot of \\"Holy S***\\" moments which would keep you glued to your sit until the very end. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for some good entertainment in the movie theater or to purchase on DVD, when it becomes available.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a great game to kill time. Brings back memories. Controls are easy. Very simple to pick up and learn.

B0060V1WJ6|5.0|hi - complex, heartful, charming.  Carrell is awesome, and the love scene between the younger people is so much better than the usual love scene. highly recommended.
1416955070|3.0|With the massive amount of hype surrounding this series, I expected to be knocked off my feet by this book. I wasn't. Don't get me wrong, Cassandra Clare is a good writer. Not the best, but good enough. The storyline is great but the characters are just so...not awesome. Hear me out before you curse me out.<br /><br />Okay, guys. For real. What's so special about Jace Wayland? Upon starting this book, I expected to find this amazing young guy whose team I was going to instantly want to be on...I SO don't wanna be on Jace's team, ya'll. He is a whiny little boy with daddy issues and I honestly don't have time for that. It's not intriguing, it's not cute, and it damn sure ain't sexy. Except for a few snarky remarks, I have no idea what any of you see in him.<br /><br />Clary is no better. Can you say BORING? She is so plain and unexceptional, and she too, is a whiner. I know they're both teenagers, but hell, they act all adult when it comes to the romance bit, like they have a clue about love. I expect that to be spread out across the board. They can't be all \\"in love\\" one second and whining like a toddler about something stupid the next. Doesn't work.<br /><br />Isabelle and Alec? Blah. Simon? Witty, but whipped. Clary doesn't want you boy! Stop pining after her like some sap. Magnus Bane? The rockstar of MI. The most AWESOME character I've encountered in a while. He is the only exception to this dull lineup. He is so fabulously gay and brilliant it's impossible to dislike him. Yes, Clare got one character right and it's Bane.<br /><br />The world-building and plot saved this book from being two stars. I love the world of the Shadowhunters and I think the use of Latin and runes is just so cool. I really like all the names of their cities and different places, and I really think the Silent Brothers are a fab addition to the book.<br /><br />However, I did NOT like the \\"romance\\" between Jace and Clary, if you can even call it that. What in the hell did Jace do to warrant gaining Clary's undying affections, and vice versa? Neither of them did a damn thing, is the answer to that. They simply \\"fell in love\\". Sorry, but I'm not convinced (except that maybe they're just horny teenagers).<br /><br />The plot twist involving Valentine (who is a pretty great villain BTW) probably would have had more of an impact if I hadn't read reviews with unmarked spoilers (for shame!). Still, it's a pretty good plot twist that offers all sorts of future complications. I'm reading City of Ashes right now, and yes, complications abound.<br /><br />Overall, just an okay book that the movie might just outdo if it's as awesome as the previews show. I'll be coming back to let you guys know.nt gaining Clary's undying affections, and vice versa? Neither of them did a damn thing, is the answer to that. They simply \\"fell in love\\".

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I started the series with a large amount of skepticism, feeling a little too old for it. What I found was something entirely more adult like than I would have imagined. This final installation of the series shows exactly how life really is in that reality: dark, unforgiving, ruthless.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />I found myself at the end of the book feeling as broken as she is. I'm very grateful that this did not have the typical tween happy ending. This was a civil war, and prices had to be paid. While there is a somewhat good ending, it carries a melancholy tune of a person so scarred that she will never fully recover. I was fully entertained from beginning to end of this series and will definitely recommend it to anyone that asks.
145162445X|4.0|a truly thought-provoking book that allows the reader to take a brand new look at the universe around them. highly recommend.
B0027UY8B8|5.0|It is a great blu ray disc set to watch the new Battlestar Galactica The Complete Series. It took me a month to watch all of it & it was worth it. Great sound on a surround system & HDTV system. Caught it on sale for a  very reasonable price.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I only wish there were some more different ways to climb to different levels.  They were all pretty much the same.  But, all in all I enjoyed it and looking forward to the next game.
B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|Volbeat first smile, a piece of industry scotch tape. . .  love it, love it, love it. . .  perhaps an industrious masterpiece, how could it not?. . .  good work. . . just left with guilt. . .  hammer on ;) no work in the gettin' to know, but gettin' to know the work ? , (perhaps) ... iz... ... ... uh ... a'financed hit ;)<br /> . . . j . . .<br /><br />;)
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Keeps ur hand and eye movement goin. Thx for the game. Very entertaining, and colorful. Keep up the good work.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Great dvd for the Michael Jackson lover. I was interesting to see all the work that goes on we never see.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|Janet Evanovich is such a good read, always.  I like to have her books handy so I can read something that will make me smile.
B00EH49DXA|5.0|One of Katy Perry's better songs.  This one has a good beat and is fun to listen to.  Finally what we've been waiting for.
B007BVMVDU|3.0|The video was great, but I thought I was ordering a DVD, and after I found out that I didn't, there was no way to get hold of someone to straighten it out. Had to go to the store and purchase it again. So it was a waste of money. You need to make it easier to talk to a representative to fix mistakes.
0865478007|5.0|In the past decade-plus I have read hundreds upon hundreds of books and articles, listened to audios and videos and have spent countless hours discussing Big Pharma and their products, their methods, etc.  There are three books at the top of my very lengthy list and this is one of them.
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|Funco POP makes great toys but I haven't liked the look of many of their models are not representative of the look of the original character. With the Minions that are offered, these look just like the minions from the Despicable Me movies. The toys are constructed well and look great.
1419702238|5.0|This product arrived at my home just two days after I placed the order.<br />My son was so excited for the book to arrive.<br />The timely shipping made my son happy.<br />The book was in great condition and the packaging was secure and protective.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is such a good book its sad scary and full of emotion I couldn't put it down I highly recommend it to everyone
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I believe in eternal Happiness given to us by God. This book  was so well written. Everyone should read it.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|This is the best Sudoku game on the Play Store. I love the various styles of Sudoku that are available. They add a lot of variety. The only reason I gave this a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because, on the Start New Sudoku page, some of the information about fastest games and average time are cut off. This is data that I want to see so that i can continue to challenge myself and see what I have done on previous games.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Big clear buttons and easy to use.  No directions needed.  Wish i had this in grade school.  Simple Simple. Simple
B009KS4XRO|3.0|1 spent 14.99 on 165 credits and never received the credits! It's been a day since I purchased the credits. I also keep losing credits when the game disconnects. That happened twice for a total loss of 40 credits. The support team has not responded to my inquiry regarding these issues!
B00876TJ2E|5.0|I love this movie and have seen it more times that I can count.  I found ordering and viewing it via Amazon Prime was very easy and it loaded in HD quick.  I definitely recommend this movie and watching it through Prime.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|This is a story that can happen anywhere. Believable to where you think your right there with the characters.<br />Its so refreshing to watch a fresh, believable movie .
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I haven't had any issue with it.  I've used it for several months now without any problems.  Great little program.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It challenged me so much but I tried and tried again, never give up,at last I succeed,l fell so good.
B003PUZ2NW|5.0|I must say when I watch most of Stallone's films, I don't think there very good movies. (just my opinion) This film is another story. It's simply a great movie. The part of Rambo is played to perfection! The Blu-ray is a great add to anyones movie library.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Had no idea what was all the commotion regarding this show.  had never seen it.  Wow! Trying to watch only 1 episode a night so I don't get to the end too quickly, but failing miserably.  Can't get enough.  I'll be purchasing all the other seasons as well.  My husband is also 2 thumbs up!  Great
B009AY04A8|4.0|I think this is more of an issue with me then the game but it kind of boring.  But if you like this sort of game, the quality is outstanding and its easy to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I started playing I got addicted to it, so if planning on downloading this game go ahead and download it soon you'll be addicted.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Well acted and cast.  Good plot/story line.  Not too violent.  This was a very enjoyable movie.  I reccomend it.  Not suitable for young kids.
B0045XGRQE|5.0|Can't go wrong with Robert Downey Jr. and Iron man!!!!  He is right.  He IS Ironman!  Great for adults as well as kids!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Enjoy .... Fun for adults to pass time and children will enjoy all the characters. Great for anyone in your family.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Love this game. Increases in difficulty at just the right pace. Gives you a chance to accumulate coins for the more difficult levels unlike the other Quells.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Love it! U have to bye it! It's so cute it's fun! Omg u have to have it! I rate it my for 5 stars!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|great and original story good for family I enjoyed it just as much as the kids maybe more simply awesome
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I love my GoPro HERO but when I first got it there were a few situations where being able to see what your filming comes in super handy, so I purchased the LCD Touch BacPac. After spending some time with it I would say the LCD is a definite necessity when using the GoPro.<br /><br />It offers three must haves which are:<br /><br />-An excellent way to see what your filming and able to gauge if you need to be close or farther away.<br />-The touch screen allows you to browse and view videos and pictures that have been taken, you can delete them as well.<br />-You can adjust camera settings with the touch screen too which is much quicker.<br /><br />Some may say just use the GoPro App on your smartphone which is nice but there are several steps when setting up the app to connect to your GoPro and a 2-3 second lag on the viewing screen. With the LCD it pops right on and works with no lag at all.
B003JTHWPA|3.0|A friend chose this for our book club. She loves it, I couldn't finish it. Maybe I will one day.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The trilogy was excellent. The eroticism had me not wanting to put them down at all. Because of the sexual content I couldn't recommend this book to everyone. I'm hoping I'll find my fifty shades one day. Best thing since Zane.......Anymore books coming?
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We loved this movie not what i expected at all I thought it would be annoying I planned on going to sleep but this kept me away we watched this 1 twice great movie highly recommend
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|Sigur Ros returns to form with Kveikur, which has some heavier, industrial elements, adding a new depth to the atmospheric sounds of Jonsi and friends.
B00AL6SLQS|5.0|Magnificent performances by the greatest American born pianist in history. His incredible ability to sing at the keyboard is renowned, and is displayed beautifully in this set. A MUST for serious classical music fans. These are the definitive recordings of all these works!<br />The pairings, especially with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra, are stellar. Truly the best ever recorded. The solo works are stunning. This comprehensive collection will bring pleasure for years!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I don't like is needs a lot of more track features like four lanes or brides that led some where else maybe a new area
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I heard that it was a good series and I enjoyed watching it. I really thought it was good! thanks
B009SCRERI|5.0|Downloaded this for our vacation to tablets.<br />Nice for on the plane and at grandma's.<br />Movie plot is a little better than previous 'adventures'.<br />There is more 'emotion' in this movie- rather than silliness.<br />My daughter (4) got caught-up in the movie and REALLY likes it.<br />This movie is better than the previous 'ho-hum' movies, IMHO.<br />Amazon download went just fine.  Must make sure that you have their 'Amazon instant video' app on your tablet to watch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really liked this book. It entertained me so well! I can't wait to read the next Hunger Games book!
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Stumbled across this series and I absolutely love it.  I refuse to watch Elementary cause I think I'll just find it annoying. However, this series is quite refreshing.
B002ZG9800|5.0|It gets very funny after the first 15 minutes. The beginning is very unique. I could have done without the sex scene at the beginning for sure, but the movie really picks up after the first 15. I couldnt stop laughing. Is it Jim Carreys best movie ever? No. But top 10 for sure.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Starts out a bit slow but great movie with great story. Filmed in Arkansas and real Arkansas State Police in movie.... I am from Arkansas if you didn't guess. Made for a great movie night.
006226303X|5.0|Neil Gaiman rocks!  When it comes to adult fantasy he has no equal.  He is able to channel the child in every adult.  This book was no exception.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|My only complaint was about Clary. What does she do and what is her purpose? This question plagued me the entire book.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|so far this is a great fun sci-fi show.  it is a bit cheesy in some ways but quite entertaining.
0307591549|5.0|I received my book as promised and in great condition, good enough to give as a gift to my daughter!
1451695195|3.0|Good for believers-support those looking for support, however, for those acquainted with near-death-experience research phenomena reported by Alexander can be explained without afterlife belief.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele's music is absolutely wonderful; heartfelt, passionate, sung with soul.  She writes all her own music and you can tell it is a reflection of her life.
B001OMJGD0|3.0|I didn't realize this was a sequel to the first two movies in the 1980s franchise (ignoring the others that came after). Pretty milk-toast and predictable.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|First off, I've been a fan of these guys for a long time. Unlike a lot of A7X fans, I actually loved Nightmare. However, this album is a totally different approach. Musically, it's much simpler than Nightmare. Gone are the crazy drum fills from Mike Portnoy. Songs like 'Doing Time' almost remind me of Guns 'N Roses, Appetite-era . Never thought I'd say that! The whole album has a Metallica 'Black Album' feel to it. Straightforward drumbeats, guitar riffs, vocals. No crazy time changes, breakdowns, or anything like that. Usually, this would be a negative, in my eyes. It really works on this album, though! The dueling guitar solos (in basically every song) are amazing.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot, the album itself SOUNDS AWESOME. It's well-recorded. It doesn't have the normal, ungodly clipping of most metal albums, nowadays (or any genre, for that matter). No loudness wars here. Excellent sound quality. Listen to it on something besides iPod headphones and you'll understand what I mean. Great dynamics. Crystal clear, no muddiness, excellent instrument separation.<br /><br />I love it. Simple as that. If you're a fan of Metallica, or any metal, I highly suggest that you check it out!
B003UYUR10|5.0|Love the story line, etc. of this movie.  I was disappointed, however, that the digital-copy was not for digital retrieval on VUDU - where I am amassing a nice little collection.  I was very happy with the condition of this item on it's arrival.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I was really into this book, although I think some of the storyline specific to the protagonist, Jack Reacher, is predictable after the second book. Some of the twists/turns of this story were very unique and gripping - I found my mouth hanging agape at times.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I was super satisfied with the original Weather Channel App.  Easy to understand... nice look... great information.  And then some geek came up with what they thought was a cool idea... wrong!  Weather Channel is off of my Kindle until they gets their smarts back, and bring back the old program.
0316017922|5.0|I love this book. I've recommend it to anyone who loves the little known details in life that have really big impact. I would have given 6 stars it they were available.
B007THA4FI|5.0|She's off to a great start and I'll be watching for the next one. I like the format she's using and the chapter headings.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|An absolute delight for King fans, JFK assassination geeks and book worms. Everybody else lives a boring life and you should go to Hell.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was well worth the time. Good story and great characters. Interesting to get cancer patients perspective on their life.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie and loaned it to a few friends. Quick delivery in perfect condition at a bargain basement price. NeedIsaymore?
0544002318|4.0|I am just a simple 5K runner but this book inspired me to run more. Last chapters are very emotional and I enjoyed them the most.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|He never fails to make me belly laugh!  I love his spot-on analysis of everyday crazies!!!!  More please David!!! Soon!
B00AEFYS8G|5.0|With a great story, music score, director & all star cast ...this movie is an absolute must own for your collection. Check out the review on Blueray.com ...the PQ & audio is even better on Blue-ray !
B00CJGP116|5.0|I bought this CD immediately after Marc appeared on The Today Show and love every song.  It's hard to believe he hasn't made a record in 10 years, and he's still fabulous.  We have tickets to see him next month, I can hardly wait.
B002RI9XHO|5.0|Orwell describes with passion and in the same time with distance the Spanish civil war. Both sides thought they were right.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Hardware is great.  They don't show the ugly Power Cable but I guess it can't be powered off the HDMI port.  I get that.  Started out as a great option, used AirCast and was displaying pictures and videos, then they updated and made it essentially a $35 Roku with less features.  Cant show my pictures anymore.  Locked it down to basically YouTube and Chrome.  I already have a Roku, AppleTV and devices with apps built in.  Don't need another.  I just want a device that can display whats on my Android phone or tablet on the TV easily without wiring it up.  Google has gotten so that if they cant show you an ad, they won't play.  Android has gotten that way too.  At least the iPhone apps aren't as &#34;in your face&#34; and you know up front the limitations.  Apple never downgraded me.  I will keep this one in hopes but was going to put one on all my TVs'.
B00785P2QC|5.0|The best game ever. It is fun for all ages. Can't believe is free.<br />Love the game when you have to keep your citizens happy.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Great movie!  For people comparing it to the 1960's television series or even the films of the 1980's, please stop pointing out how different it is.  Times are different!  I enjoyed TOS and the films but I am not at all disappointed in the different feel these new films have.<br /><br />I admire the courage of the writers to develop a plot that dares to mimic any aspect of the original films and of an iconic character.  And for the most part, it worked!  Sure, Khan doesn't look like Khan.  As an aside, when new Spock contacted old Spock, I wonder how old Spock would've reacted if new Spock showed him a photo of new Khan.  Clearly, old Spock would've been like, 'WTH?'<br /><br />Anyway, fun movie.  Great acting.  Great plot.
B002XXPNXG|5.0|This movie follows a young couple who met by chance 9 years before, lost touch, and find each other again.  Their conversations are deep, far-reaching, funny, touching, filled with longing, and very human.  One remarkable aspect of the film is the unusually long single-take sequences where they sustain their dialogue for minutes at a time.  It is a tour-de-force performance by both actors, who also were heavily involved in the making of the script.  The film ends with a question-mark, leaving us wondering where they are going to take this remarkable encounter.  Like so much of life, we are with them in mid-stream, and denoument will have to unfold rather than being formulaic and predictable.  We loved this movie!
B00BU2SIW4|3.0|I loved Depeche mode in High-school and College, but this album is too slow.<br /><br />I am still waiting for it to grow on me.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|My favourite book by Gaiman. The story is fantastic with all the classic fairy tale elements without being remotely childish (even though the story is about a child), and the writing is superb! Would highly recommend!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|What's to say?  great characters !  Some wonderful funny lines!  Sigh ..  and Nathan is so handsome!  Plus who doesn't love a who-done-it ???
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A well written, directed and acted piece of British soap.  Each character plays their role to perfection.<br />However, there is always someone just around the corner or down the hall or listening, snooping on<br />each other and tattling.  But guess this is a necessity to keep the action going.  Maggie Smith plays<br />her role to the utmost.  A true professional actress, whom has been revered for decades.
1933633867|5.0|An astounding book that provides truly unique insight into modern life, and specifically, money and debt, their relation to nation states and how the absurd trick of money lending has enslaved us to our office desks.<br /><br />If you ever have the time or inclination to lift your nose from the grindstone of 9 to 5, a mortgage and a nuclear family and want to truly understand the forces that led to you living as you do, this book will tell you. Don't expect to understand it all in one read, and take your time.<br /><br />It's also worth reading the other reviews; particularly Aaron Brown's, and the responses to his review, but probably best to do that after you have understood the book.<br /><br />It seems obvious, but anthropology is really the only true empirical social science. And if that is the case, then the absurdity and obscenity that is modern economics must take some beating as the most nihilistic and destructive school of thought ever invented.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|This is a great exercise for the mind. Tension release. Love the ability to choose level. Good for on the go and available at your fingertips.
1611761581|4.0|This is a young adult book and I am an adult but it was nice to read a book without having to worry about sex, cussing, and violence that is rampant in other books.  I will continue reading these books.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Great potential, but left me wanting. But it worked great on our roku, so no complaints there. Thank you so much!
078881172X|5.0|You can't go wrong with Disney animation. The VHS format completed my existing set. This is a wonderful fantasy story
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is an incredible writer and there isn't a book yet that he has written that I have not enjoyed. When I read his books they come to life......the way a book should be when you read something. I always have a hard to putting them down. I loved this book and cried as usual......now I can't wait to see the movie~:)
B00AEFY5TI|3.0|The quality is good just did not realize it was for wide screen so it is a little strange on my old analog TV.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|Have watched the five seasons of this show.  It is really a very entertaining cast and the story lines are always very interesting.  Simon Baker adds a great deal with his off the wall actions.  The interaction of the cast is fabulous.
B00CFA222M|4.0|Lots of action and while not graphic it is pretty intense for young children.  For older kids and adults it is a lot of fun.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Shame it was only one season.  Ahead of it's time in script concepts and special effects.  Thnx for having this available!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I hope they make a movie. I would so see that movie and I guess I'm going to read the next book.
0316228532|2.0|Had this book almost a year and cant seem to get into it. Its got a good story line; Its just slow moving.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Seriously, do not think about it, watch it! Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Red Scarlet! Enough Said!
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Ever since i heard A7X was coming out with a new album this year, i was excited.  i also predicted that they would take a dramatic left turn musically (like their version of Load) because it would be next to impossible to top Nightmare, in my opinion.  that being said, i commend them for not being afraid to let their sound evolve and go out on a limb.  they are my favorite current metal band and i cant wait to see them in concert this fall.  this cd is slower paced and much groovier than anything theyve done before.  i like that the new drummer has his own style, he isnt trying to be The Rev part 2.  Matt Shadows voice sounds phenomenal and Synyster Gates' solos are....well...what do u expect.
B00004RE7D|5.0|a good price  a good classic addition to my dvd collection<br />I have added a lot of dvd titles from amazon
B00406O7YK|4.0|Good movie I hadn't seen before. Fine for all ages old and young funny light good. Would recommend to anyone
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was entertaining and Denzel Washington is great in this film!  Then again, he's great in everything he does :)
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I absolutely love this show! HBO has done it again! They have a real hit on their hands! I highly recommend this show to anyone! Age appropriate of course.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|a good movie to add to my dvd collection  of over 100 titles that I own I will soon have to add more shelves
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Very good book in the action series. Good back story on Reacher's past. The pace was incredible, and the suspense was worth the wait. Recommended.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Despite its age (it was published in the mid 1980s), this book holds up surprisingly well in terms of being a sci-fi novel.  In fact, the author does a decent job of describing certain technologies in a vague enough way as to allow your imagination to morph them into the present day or near-future equivalent that they would be (for example, students are described many times using a \\"desk\\", but after awhile you come to imagine it as essentially an oversized tablet computer, which is remarkable given that tablets didn't really exist when this book was written).  Further, he more or less nails the nature of the internet (which, again, hardly existed in the 80s) right on the head; things like chat rooms and social websites and hiding your identity through casual anonymity are mentioned as being a base part of the new future.<br /><br />However, when it truly comes down to the technical aspects of this future, the author leaves MUCH to be desired.  Through an introduction in the Kindle Edition, he freely admits he's an English major, and has no technical training of any kind.  This much is obvious when reading \\"Ender's Game\\"; there are many scenes, technologies, and aspects that are not only mentioned casually without a description, but often use generic terms that convey something that doesn't par with how the characters sometimes use this technology or how it works (see: \\"desk\\", above).  And many scenes could do with at least some kind of exposition, even if it's light on jargon or technical terms; when Ender first ships out to the training academy, the entire process composes a dozen paragraphs and a couple of pages.  There is is no descprition of the station itself, how big it is, where it is, how long it takes to get there ... in fact, in reading the scene straight through, if not for the mention of a shuttle, it almost seems like he TELEPORTS to the station, with little passage of time in between.  The book continues to take these kind of narrative liberties throughout, so it's not just one section that was maybe written in one state of mind.<br /><br />Despite all this, I did enjoy the author's ability to realistically convey dialogue and character interactions.  Some have complained that the thoughts and speech by the children involved (including the protagonist, Ender) is too adult in nature. However, very briefly (again, one of those things that needs more exposition), there's some commentary about Ender being government sponsored, and something like an insinuation that he's genetically bred to be hyper-intelligent.  If this is the case, then this realistically explains the speech level of the children.  Still, this aspect is jarring on the whole, since the speech is adult, but some of the emotions are clearly juvenile.<br /><br />This book has a twist ending that, while somewhat predictable the closer you get to it, is no less clever both in and of itself and within the context of the story.  This alone made me originally willing to give this book 4 stars ... but what ultimately should have been the climax and ending of the novel continues to drag on for another couple of chapters and dozens of pages.  Frustratingly, there were three or four moments after the climax that would have CLEARLY been perfect places to end the book ... but then something more happens.  Once or twice would have been understandable, but the fact this occurs more than that makes it feel forced and awkward, like the author went back AFTER he was done and added some more chapters to setup the book for a sequel.<br /><br />Speaking of which ... when this novel DOES finally come to a close, it does so with a series of events so improbable and vaguely conveyed that really, it kind of ruined the book for me and makes it doubtful that I'll read any of the other books in this series.hout, so it's not just one section that was maybe written in one state of mind.<br /><br />Despite all this, I did enjoy the author's ability to realistically convey dialogue and character interactions.

This alone made me originally willing to give this book 4 stars ... but what ultimately should have been the climax and ending of the novel continues to drag on for another couple of chapters and dozens of pages.  Frustratingly, there were three or four moments after the climax that would have CLEARLY been perfect places to end the book ... but then something more happens.  Once or twice would have been understandable, but the fact this occurs more than that makes it feel forced and awkward, like the author went back AFTER he was done and added some more chapters to setup the book for a sequel.<br /><br />Speaking of which ... when this novel DOES finally come to a close, it does so with a series of events so improbable and vaguely conveyed that really, it kind of ruined the book for me and makes it doubtful that I'll read any of the other books in this series.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Another great book. Can't get enough of her books.. Can't wait for the next one.  I am now watching the series on tv

B009NPA3Q4|5.0|My mother, husband, toddler and I love it! My toddler daughter loves dancing to it too! We watched Phil Phillips on American IDOL and were so happy for him when he won. I used to be a big Dave Matthews fan and prefer this type of music. Keep up the good work! Can't wait to see you in concert one day or hear more great hits from you : )
B00CATSONE|5.0|I loved to learn new things about Tesla and Edison that aren't taught in school. I also enjoyed being challenged to listen to my inner inventor and find my calling.
B003IDMUTK|3.0|its an okay read, it drags out a bit and is not as thrilling as some of his other books.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|another good addition to my dvd collection of over 100 titles I will soon have to add more shelf space
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is adorable and my grand daughter loves it.  She thoroughly enjoys and it keeps her occupied.<br />I would recommend.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Well written and does exactly what it promises. No wasted words and nothing left out. Excellent value for the money.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's okay it get kinda boring after awhile but it had great 3d views making you feel like your there and it is pretty fun to play it is expensive and not free though.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I thought the story was great but some of the language was unnecessary. Overall, I loved the story and could not put it down.
0141335750|4.0|I have just started reading this book (on my daily commute). So far it meets or exceeds Mr. Riordan's other books
B0071XO8RA|5.0|CAN I just tell you, I have been looking for this book for so long!  This is a first for me ad I don't usually read books of this genre and came across it quite by accident. I am so pleased I did. Looking forward to more from you. Love your writing style. Keep up the good work and thank you!

B005ES0Y0Y|5.0|I bought these because I love Crocs and thought they'd be great for a trip.  As I stood in the long, snaking airport security line, I glanced down at people's feet.  Out of  around 100 people, I was the only one wearing Crocs.  I saw lots of women in wobbly high heel wedges with painted toes popping out but, to my surprise, not one pair of Crocs were being worn.  I told this to my sister-in-law when she picked me up at the airport, and she explained that it's because &#34;Croc's are ugly.&#34;  Well, it's true that they are not the cutest shoe out there but they are so practical and comfortable.  So, if you are like me and put function over form, you will like Crocs.  This particular style is also has a very durable sole.  I plan to wear them for a long time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this Bingo game. It's my favorite! Not so easy to win and I wish it was easier to get credits or they gave you more credits. But overall a great game!

B00AFCEIB0|3.0|A good old Google search like all other Android products would be far better.<br />Sometimes the customizations for specific products can be very off putting, perhaps I should have bought another tablet and just got the free app instead.
B00AJER3SE|4.0|This is an iconic film for both Cameron (writer/director) and Schwarzenegger, who's famous line, &#34;I'll be back&#34; originated in this film.<br /><br />This is perhaps the best restoration of the film, offering the best Blu-Ray value for the film collector. I agree with most of the in-depth reviews and therefore have no additions or rebuffs, only  another recommendation toward this being a best value choice among the Blu-Ray copies of this film available.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is super fun and teaches valid points about owning a horse. What more could I say. I love love love this game
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|You can really get lost in this game.  I've really enjoyed it.  The only drawback is that you want to play quickly and e d up running out of energy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is the best app I have ever got!!!! if your kid(s) love animals than this is the best app to get!! if you get this app I hope you enjoy it like me!!!!!!!!:) :)
B00B4804KS|5.0|This film seems to have been intended to be a 3D movie from the start. The remake is true to the theatre experience - a thrill ride, especially the point-of-view with a T Rex chasing you, or high up in a tree rapidly falling as limbs are breaking underneath you.<br /><br />Depth of field is well presented, so this is best experienced on as large a 3D HDTV as you can get. I used a 47&#34; LCD and it was a lot of fun to watch. Of course, you can still take this copy to a Blu-Ray player and watch it in 2D where necessary (although I didn't personally test this).<br /><br />I definitely recommend this film to anyone liking the genre and thrills.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Which I found sorta anti-climactic. Not much about the world outside of OASIS. Lotta great memories in all the 80s references.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son was always on my phone. Finally he found subway surfers fie kindle.  We both got what we wanted. Relief .
B0067EKY9K|5.0|My wife has watched this movie at least 20 times so I bought it for her. She immediately watched it again. Needless to say she loves it. I've watched it twice and it is a very good movie, especially if to like romantic comedies.
B009LGO88E|4.0|This peripheral is more than a comfort device for the 3DS. Its additional circle pad requires it to beam data into the IR port, which is why it also is battery operated.<br /><br />This will mean you will have to &#34;un dock&#34; the 3DS from this device when you play games with external base units like Disney Infinity and Skylanders Giants will not communicate through this device.
B00AHG9KYE|4.0|There were several times where the book seemed to be just words, filling pages. But other times it was good sci-fi. Not one of Mr. Clarkes best, but adequate.
0345525558|5.0|Loved this story of the struggles of a young girl and her love of flowers that she uses to represent life.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the story line between Gideon and Eva. The story has held my interest from page one of Bared to You.
1476733953|3.0|WOOL isn't a major work. It is an interesting sci-fi experiment, well-told, for the most part.<br /><br />Until there is one revelation that is so amateurish, so telegraphed, and far too early that it spoils my anticipation for the rest of the series...which now, I honestly do not think I will read. Yes, this error was THAT amateurish.<br /><br />Do you know what foreshadowing is? There are two kinds.  1) Deft and subtle foreshadowing, where the reader has no idea what is coming and only realizes he/she's been hinted at what is to come later in the story, and 2)heavy-handed foreshadowing, where repeated, events are so obvious they insult the intelligence of the reader even before the big revelation.<br /><br />Here, we are dealing with the latter. I won't spoil it for you.<br /><br />I am aching to tell you of this HUGE mistake, but I cannot. If you don't recognize it, as I said, you are a noob. But that's okay...ignorance is bliss, so read on!  If you are an experienced reader/writer, you will certainly see this flaw. Read on?  Up to you.<br /><br />I'm halfway through the Wool Omnibus and find it weakly satisfying. The writing, I feel, surpasses the limitations of the contrived environment and story. But I feel that it drags, is too internal rather than plot driven. Not bad, but I will look forward to this author's works in ten years.<br /><br />ADDENDUM...AFTER READING ALL THE WOOL BOOKS.<br /><br />I stand by my review. The same new-writer mistakes he made in the first part were continued in the past, telegraphing things to come so obviously I wanted to scream.<br /><br />Instead of related the science of his fiction, he chose to relate the humanity of the situation.  Which, in fact, was mostly okay with me, because the relationships were interesting...although they mostly were not resolved, except by death, which is a coward's way out for a writer.<br /><br />Still, all the raw bones of a situation are there for experienced film writers to fix. All the Wool parts are filled with way too much exposition and descrption. The big plot was broken down into tiny struggles of individuals, some of which meant nothing.<br /><br />I could go on, but this is a good rough idea in the hands of a very young author (at least in experience). Kids will love this more than experienced fantasy/science fiction readers, which is a testament to its superficial/emotional appeal.<br /><br />STILL, I was drawn into the personal stories and situations, and appreciated the author's research into, for instance, hypothermia.  Who Jules discovers is rather ridiculous and Peter Pan-like, but, why not.<br /><br />I'll read the rest. The author deserves payment for his work, and I hope he keeps writing---and gets a better editor.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Guys you can listen to the haters if you want but I highly recommend you form your own opinion by giving this album a few listens. A7X has changed their sound but I think it is for the better. I have been a fan since SOUNDING THE SEVENTH TRUMPET and this is honestly my favorite album. I love the new Old School Metal feel they have acquired and I don't think they are ripping anyone off. They are paying homage to their idols and I commend them for that. This cd is far heavier that NIGHTMARE or the Self Titled record and more in the vein of City of Evil but with much stronger vocals. The music is very thrashy at times, and epic sounding and I can't help but bang my head when hearing it. You can't please everyone but please listen for yourself. If you're an open minded A7X fan or open minded heavy metal fan for that matter, you will most likely enjoy this record. I highly recommend it and the haters can keep on hating because I assure you that the true fans and The Band themselves don't care.....\m/
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I think this is and amazing game. I mean if u r looking to be addicted to a game this is the one.
B001HN6940|5.0|Johnny Depp does a fantastic job as the Mad Hatter. The picture quality is amazing. The DTS audio track sounds great with a surround sound audio system.
B005WQ4RP6|5.0|Completely amazed at the intensity DeNiro brought to the evil, crazy guy. Mitchum's wry comments were well placed and the cameo parts of actors from the original were a nice touch of reminiscence and a touch of humor in a black natured film
B00DDZM0GQ|1.0|Sadly, this game requires Internet access to play it. Presumably for leaderboards and achievements. These should be optional not required. I don't always have Internet access where I want to play. Since I can't play wherever and whenever I want to, uninstalled. There are too many other good games out there that aren't unnecessarily restrictive. Too bad really as the game looked entertaining.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I think that the game was good and entertainment was good butt I felt it repeated to much. I was kind of upset because it left me hanging at the end.<br /><br />Rheajean91@yahoo.com
0312944926|4.0|good story, adventure, and an eye opener in view of today's scandal involving the NSA. You want to keep turning the pages. It gets too foul near the last third. This book, like so many trashy books written lately, would be much improved if the foul character toned down his filthy mouth.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I can't believe the avant garde innovation on this program.  The writers are amazing.<br /><br />It looks like I need six more words for this review, so I gave it 11 more.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|A great movie for children and adults.  My granddaughter watches it sometimes 2\twice a day when she visits on the weekends.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great character descriptions in this book. The author really made me feel I knew each of the characters. Great read.
0316228532|1.0|same as Cuckoos Calling. This is like walking, (running once you get the aroma) through the final level of Dante's Inferno. It is a sewer of excrement. Rowling had better return to more intellectual pursuits. The Potter series was excellent, this is stupid.
B00D4ABW82|5.0|I've liked WCAR since their last album and this album is just as good if not a major improvement. As much as I like WCAR, I had always thought that they needed to just drop the unclean vocals. Cleans go a lot better with their instrumentals and it sounds a lot better in general. This album is pretty much like UWWGTB except for the fact that it contains less unclean vocals, which I've been anticipating anyway so i'm very happy with this release. People will still try to say it's bad but honestly some people will complain about anything.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Great collectors item with an awesome display case. Loved the movie and was a great transfer I would highly recommend to any batman fan.....
B009AY04A8|4.0|It's a fun game not too challenging but has ,in my opinion, too much dialogue. All in all it keeps you entertained.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote helps me keep everything handy and easily accessible across all of my devices. A great tool to have  when managing a lot of information that comes at you throughout the day.
B003OCWF6I|4.0|This movie felt like an A-Team knock off.  That being said, The Losers still had some good actors with Chris Evans, Idris Elba, Jeffery Dean Morgan, and Zoe.  Other than a very cheesy villian, this was a movie worth watching.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I had to so I did. But so far I am liking the game. I give it 3 stars. Really do.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is one of the most heartwarming books I have read in recent years.  It is written with honesty and sensitivity to the difficulties of dealing with growing old and dying.  There is so much real love in this book that I am surprised it took me so long to discover and read it.
B00062IDCO|5.0|I have to admit I never watched Voyager while it aired on tv, my brother started buying the seasons on dvd and I started watching them and absolutely fell in love, although I have to admit I REALLY can NOT stand neelix, UGH !!!! I realize they had to have a character from that quadrant,( Kes was okay ), but his character was so nauseatingly ingratiating, I wouldn't have been surprised to see him lick peoples boots! When I saw MELD when Tuvok strangeled neelix I was so HAPPY, but then found out he was on the holodeck, dam!!!!! The show would have been better off without neelix, or at least maybe a different actor who wasn't so pushy, if I had been the captain and he'd turned my private dining room into a galley he'd have been off the ship in an eyeblink!!!!!! One thing I never understood is WHY were there NEVER any Voyager MOVIES ?????????
B009GI8J1O|5.0|Mr Mitchell takes you on a wonderful journey through time, language and human nature. Absolutely spectacular! Not always easy reading (as English is not my mother tongue) but well worth it.
B0040I09RM|4.0|good series so far. i am only thru episode 7 and i have enjoyed it. I only need one more word to submit this review...what a pain
B0063M22QO|5.0|Very addicting. Sometimes easy sometimes hard. Love how I can change the different tiles. There are many different versions and levels.
0062255657|4.0|A fine young adult novel by Gaiman. Very quick read and certainly not as dark as works for an older audience.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|And addicting! Though my kids help with that lol. They love looking at the pictures. Love to play this game :)
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I will stick to the software that came with my Kindle. This app is not easy to use and is complicated. I am not impressed with it at all.
1609611543|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone who has experienced a belly ache after eating pizza or too many dinner rolls at Lone Star or what ever restaurant that serves the yeast rolls.  Read this book and you will think of them differently.  It is poison to your system
0385537816|5.0|Love it! Last book could have been stretched out and had a rush feel to it! Other than that a great read! Highly recommend it! You will be hooked!;)
B0030SZ2D4|3.0|This is one of those entertaining action films with no redeeming social values other than good taste, strong characters, and a fun story.  A certain cure for boredom.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I really like playing this game. If you like playing Mahjong, you should enjoy this game. Any age that can match pictures can play.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Although every episode has a similar premise, the facts and cases change and an appropriate amount of drama is integrated.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Love Taylor!! Great album! I would highly recommend this album to anyone who loves Taylor or anyone who is just starting to love her. It's great!!
B000VUCIZO|5.0|This book is very interesting. Any reader can approach it but there is enough technical information to interest those who are familiar with computer architecture.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very entertaining. fast I have never had it freeze or anyhting.  just wish it didn't take so long for the horse to energy
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Not cheesy and often funny and sometimes poignant. All the twists worked and didn't seem contrived.  Carrell can do the straight man as well as his cornball schtick
0316153826|5.0|I always have enjoyed Connelly's novels and just recently have gone to the very beginning of his Harry Bosch series. The only one I haven't read is The Black Echo, his first. Looking forward to ordering and reading it soon, as well as his next! Great plot lines and great characters.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|After the Whitey Bulger trial, I had to see this again. Jack Nicholson makes a great Whitey. There was a gritty realism to this (oh, review cliche). No silliness to satisfy the slow-learners in the audience, no winking at the camera.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I have the full one and it is awesome.my mom surprised me and bought it for me. You can use purple eye liner on my kindle fire hd  this is my favorite game.thanks for everything libii
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Very Great item to have if u stay with a friend or planing on visiting relatives. its eazy to setup. the screen is a perfect size. the only problem i have with it is that the screen folds back and it makes it harder to see if ur not at eye level.
0307476073|1.0|It hard to believe that people can be misled into buying a book titled \\"WILD\\".<br />It didn't happen to me because my county library paid for this read.<br />My time is valuable, after hiking weekends in the desert of Arizona for<br />twenty years it is still said Best: \\"A SOLO HIKER HAS A FOOL FOR A HIKING PARTNER\\"
B00003CXB4|5.0|The product arrived in a very short period of time.  We are enjoying watching it with our grand daughter...On to Disney World soon.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I absolutely love this app it is amazingly fun I cant believe how fun this app is and definetly for long car rides or rainy days stuck inside. I definetly recommend this app to whoever gets bored easily. :D
B00005BPKD|5.0|We got this kick board for my 2 year old son after seeing another boy play with it in the pool. He loves it! He holds onto the handles and is able to kick and practice balancing. He uses in the \\"baby pool\\" and is able to push off the side. Every child loves to play with this toy.  It is very durable and has lasted through quite a number of kids playing with it roughly. Even the 5 year olds at the pool love it. Th handles are firm and have not even come close to ripping off.  Highly recommend. I was weary to buy because of the price. But it is so durable that it is worth it the cost. Every parent asks where I got it and is considering buying for their child.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Excellent product...quick delivery. My 3 year old granddaughter has already watched it four or five times in preparation to our trip to Disney World.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|The game is a fun and different way of playing solitaire in a golf setting, and its free to try it out.... so try it.
B008602KQI|2.0|It felt like they produced it as a TV series, then later decided to release it as a movie instead.  The story premise had potential, but was very poorly executed, resulting in a brain-dead viewing experience, with little character development/connection and lackluster acting from Lawrence and others. (Lenny's acting was the best in the movie)
1452126607|5.0|A real page turner here. Just can't wait for the next month. I promised myself not to look ahead. September is coming and I am as excited as can be. No wait...I will have to wait till January to remove the plastic film wrap. Sigh.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great app with good replay value. It can be very addicting but not too hard and frustrating. Worth the download.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game.  Some replay value,  inbounds just get faster,  limited upgrades avaliable .  Glade I got it on the free of the day of
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I couldn't figure out where the other weight was to pass the level that had the car that you had to jack up with the yellow jack.  If I could have figured this one out I would have given the game 3 stars!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Well built, game . Puzzles are well laid out and not overly done .thoroughly enjoyed playing.  Great time waster.  Look forward to the next release
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is a blast I love that I can see real people I am playing with instead of those Avatars.
B00BESKTMG|1.0|Bad directing, bad acting, bad dialogue, bad special effects. Rza tries to squeeze in too many storylines and doesn't do a good job segwaying between these subplots. Which also makes the movie long and drawn out.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Right bang for the 3 bucks. Occasional glitch-coming out of the scene seems to clear it up. A couple of the minigames are fussy to solve-small graphic elements on small screen. Enjoy!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|It's worth a rental and the action and pacing are pretty good. Dialogue and character development are not that great. We just see dredd say a few words and blow people up but maybe that's his comic book personality. If you like guns, explosions, blood, action, it's worth it.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|For use with USB Thumb drives or external hard drives with external power. You can connect iphone cables to this adapter to charge your phone but it's not meant to play music from iphones.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I only wish Rodriguez was given the promotional opportunity when he was first discovered. It is a great story with great music.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|What can I say, just another outstanding read by Pat Cornwell, I am never disappointed in her mysteries. Love the continuing characters.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I never thought a show about a serial killer could be so enjoyable. It has the right mix of comedy (yes, a show about a serial killer can be funny), and drama.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Delightful, delightful, delightful!!  She is such a talented author!!  It's loaded with humor and impossible situations that keep you turning the page to see what is going to happen next. I really enjoy this author.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|The Call of the Wild is a classic &#34;Naturalist&#34; story. London goes to great lengths to make it clear that the dogs are not &#34;humanly&#34; conscious of their actions, but rather, that his story is a translation of their thoughts and instincts into human terms. Personally, I liked the longer White Fang better. They should be read in conjunction with one and other. I revisited these stories as an adult and found them very enjoyable reading. For a fun entertainment treat, read the first chapter of White fang and then watch the movie &#34;The Gray&#34; with Liam Neeson.
B002G4FQI4|5.0|As always, so impressive! As we have all heard before- he could sing the phone book and I would melt!!
B008X9Z3UC|4.0|The Belkin portfolio sleeve,made for the Kindle Fire HD 7\\", fits the Nook HD as well. It fits like a glove and the zipper just makes it around but works fine for a carrying case. The padding in the the case is a bit thin but does offer protection from scratches and scraps and will give some protection if the device is dropped or bumped.
B005F6NA5G|5.0|I sort of got on this George Benson kick and I am glad I did.  I am really enjoying this CD. He sounds amazing and has still got it!
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Worth watching if it's free and there's nothing better.  Otherwise it's just a mindless shoot-em-up film.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but the original with Stallone actually had more substance.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I bought this for my mom who loves old country music!  She plays it all the time.  Vocals are great and the steel guitar awesome.  Definitely would buy it again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Did make sense in a round about way.  Found a great cheat site to go to that kept the frustration level from skyrocketing.  Will buy more rooms as they become available.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This Emma has had great reviews, but, this Emma is not as Ms. Austen presented  her, so it seems.  Kate Beckinsale did Emma as close to the book as is possible, but, if you want another version,, this one is very good, just be ready for the differences.  Mr. Knightley in this version is also played with less authority, though he is very likeable.  Again, the Kate Beckinsale Mr. Knightley is just as in the story.<br /><br />It is now March 2014, and I have watched this EMMA again and I LOVED it!!! Just wanted you all to know.  Also, I re-watched Kate Beckinsale's Emma, and Gywneth Paltrow's Emma, and while those actors did excellent work with what was given to them to work with, it was very noticeable that much of the story was not developed nearly as much as Ms. Garai's Emma.  So now,  Roma Garai's Emma is my complete favorite.  I love her portrayal, her spunkiness and all.  Also, Mr. Knightley is wonderfully done as real, caring, compassionate, and truly loving his friend, Emma, and wanting the best for her.  He is not perpetually upset and angry as in the Beckinsale version.  So do enjoy!!
B004LWZW7O|5.0|A little predictable but I am glade I bout it cause I have already watched it twice.....what more can I say!
B0042U94UQ|3.0|Just not my style at all.  Watched it on recommendation from someone who enjoyed it immensely, but I could not get into it.  Maybe you will, maybe .
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|What can I say. The game was awesome, so is the soundtrack. Gustavo Santaolalla has created a moody soundtrack on par to the desolation and despair felt in trying to survive in the wastelands set in the game. Definitely worth getting if you too enjoyed the game!
B000YIGNKE|3.0|I liked parts of it.  Some was overdramatized.  Her running through the streets did seem to fit the character she was playing.  But, the original BBC was better.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Not the same old gem destroying, bubble popping games that others are promoting. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others tired of playing the same old stuff...
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Saw Black Sabbath live in 2013 tour, made me buy this album. It's pretty good considering the age of all the band members except for the new drummer who is extremely good.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Someone recommended this book to me and I am so happy I read it!  It was fascinating and fun.  Great story line and also informative.
B008133MDK|5.0|I absolutely love this show. It does a wonderful job at telling the stories of Sherlock Holmes. The actors are fantastic. This show really engages you in each story and keeps you coming back for more.
B0025WX2YW|4.0|That's about all I have to say about it. I've seen better, I've seen worse. Four Stars! P.S. Ann Boleyn is a SMOKESHOW!!
B00CHMBQRA|3.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Have you ever seen a movie that seemed so familiar you could swear you've seen it before? Well, that was my experience with Erased (aka The Expatriate outside the U.S.) Taking obvious influences from many action-thrillers that preceded it, Erased, like Ben Logan (Aaron Eckhart), suffers from a lack of identity. While interesting at times, the story being told is one we've seen many times before and, in some cases, it's been done better. With that being said, though, the film still managed to hold my attention despite its derivative nature and when it was all said and done I actually had a good time.<br /><br />You follow the life of Ben Logan and his daughter Amy (Liana Liberato). Ben is an ex-CIA agent and because of this he made sure that Amy wasn't a huge part of his life while she was growing up. I guess in his eyes having no father was better than having a father who worked 24/7. Anyway, the two of them wind up on the run after Ben goes to work one day only to find that the company had vanished. As a confused Ben tries to put the pieces together, a government conspiracy unravels which forces these two to literally fight for their life.<br /><br />Truth be told, I knew very little about this film going in. I had seen a trailer beforehand, but beyond that I went in pretty blind. For me, the most unfortunate thing about this movie is how much promise it had. You see, it is possible to make great films regardless of whether or not they draw from previous works, but you need to add something different tot he mix. Well, in Erased's starting moments I was convinced that I was going to receive just that. While the broken father/daughter relationship is a bit overdone, Eckhart and Liberato had some great chemistry and it seemed as if the film was setting itself up for something amazing. It didn't take long for things to fall apart, though.<br /><br />One or two cliches here and there are ok, but within the first 30 minutes I was slapped with every action-thriller cliche in the book. Unfortunately, I can't even say that it stopped there. Not only is his relationship with his daughter rocky, he's a CIA agent. Not only is he late to his daughter's award ceremony, the man at his work is secretly working for the people trying to set him up. Not only did he split up with the mother of his child, she never told Amy why or what he did. The cliches kept coming and it reached a point where it became too much. Still, as much as I seemingly disliked this movie so far, I continued on. Why? Well, I don't have an answer for that. It's probably because I try to give every movie the benefit of the doubt and this is probably a character flaw of mine.<br /><br />Anyway, as cliched as the scenes were, the bits with Ben and Amy were actually the most enjoyable sequences in the film. It wasn't until the writer's attempted to get technical with the outside workings of the organization that I really wanted to pull my hair out. Now I'm a fairly intelligent guy, but nothing seemed to make any sense. All the hard details about his previous job never felt important or authentic. It was almost as if they were thrown in at the last minute. It's like the writers realized that a backstory is important, but they didn't think about it until they were already in the process of filming. The only thing these scenes really accomplished was destroying the crippled flow that was built up by the previous scenes with Ben and Amy.<br /><br />Now up to this point I've kind of torn this movie to shreds, but it's not all bad. In fact, it's not bad at all. It's just very underwhelming. With that said, though, Erased did manage to create some pretty intense action sequences and the acting was solid as well. While the action scenes may not have been extremely innovative, they always kept me on my toes. The fighting didn't feel stiff and the scenes never felt like they were dragged on for too long. They were in, they were out, and they were moving on. Also, Eckhart and Liberato performed really well in the scenes they were in together. While most of the supporting cast never felt important, these two really did a good job of bringing these characters to life.<br /><br />Finally, the score, composed by Jeff Danna, was... inconsistent, at best. Like majority of the elements present in the movie, the score borrows from things we've heard from in the past. Majority of the time I didn't even notice it was there because none of the compositions really stood out to me, but there were a few notable exceptions. For example, the piece heard in the final scene leading into the credits was really well done, but other than that most of it was just background noise.<br /><br />Overall Score: 6/10 - Personally, had they focused more on Ben and Amy and less on the CIA then this score would probably be higher. With the chemistry they had on screen there was a lot of potential to do something amazing, but in the end they just settled for something average. The story isn't anything to write home about and there's a ton of cliches, but the acting was solid and the fight scenes were entertaining. Part of me wishes there was something substantial for me to really love this movie, but alas this is what we were given.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|The trailer looked a lot more interesting.  The seperate stories in the movie don't relate as much as I expected (barely at all), and a few events seem to be left hanging with no explanation.  Why is the song special?  What happened in the record store?  Why do Korean people in the future look american?  Are those asian girls clones or something?  What resulted from that whole rebellion shootout thing?  How did the world devolve back into a forest?  Are those people on the ship aliens or what?  Who thought it was a good idea to put the villains from Road Warrior in this movie?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can keep my interest but pretty predictable. It walks u through it somewhat easily. But I will continue to play.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I guess I don't read enough fiction.  I was expecting a whole movie here, but it was just the first of three!  I can't be the only one who didn't know, can I?  So, yeah, I was disappointed when the movie ended so far from the mountain.  BTW, hwy didn't the birds just take them the rest of the way there?...
1451695195|5.0|I HAVE RECOMMENDED  pROOF OF hEAVEN TO MANY OF MY FRIENDS. It was a book that I found extremely interesting especially since it was written by a neurosurgeon.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I wasn't really grabbed by the story, seems like they half-essed that and made up for it with loads of CGI.  However, the acting kept my attention.  The familiar actors were good as usual, but this new kid (plays Jack) is simply charming.  His performance as a zombie elsewhere redeemed that movie.
0345529057|5.0|Very happy with my purchase. Got the books much faster than expected. Also it was very cheep compared to translated lithuanian versions of it. Those 4 books + shipping = 1 book in my country (hardcover).
B004AQR29C|1.0|Did I grow up or did these guys lose their talent with old age?  I just couldn't get into it.  It was a silly testosterone trip.  Maybe I'll re-watch some of the movies I thought were cool as a kid and see if they still seem good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins did a great job with tous book she is a wonderful authours  for those or you out there who like fun and tweenage book or is the right one for you
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Thank you, yet again, Quentin Tarantino for another great movie.  And what a great cast!  Foxx, Waltz, Dicaprio, Jackson etc...  They really made you like/hate their characters!  Definitely see this movie! ... Without your kids!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Enjoyed Bared ...  Just bought Reflected...  But after reading the reviews refuse to get sucked in fore a five book series, especially if so many reviewers hated book three....<br /><br />Moving on to a different author.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This movie was really interesting in that it told this true story.  The acting was fine and even though you knew the ending, they managed to make it a bit suspenseful.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very fun game. Have only been playing it for one day but there doesn't seem to be a way to really earn coins, one here and there. If you want to &#34;revive&#34; or get clothes you have to buy coins not much chance to earn enough. Great graphics.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I liked it.  It's certainly worth your time and money to rent.  Has some really interesting/clever twists too!  Mind blowing ones.  Also, well cast and acted.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's an addictive game that reminds me a lot of Missile Commander back in the video arcade days.<br /><br />Pros - descent graphics<br />Cons - drains battery.
B00BF11STU|4.0|This was riveting!  I was very engaged the whole time.  The acting was great and the story progressed well. Yep
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The Beatles like you've never heard them before with the back stories on some of their most memorable material.  I purchased the stereo version but after reading John's comments (Lennon that is) on listening to Sgt. Pepper's in mono ( as it was originally intended) I purchased the mono version of that disc. You will not be disappointed with this set!
B009HV2JT8|2.0|I didn't expect this movie to be good.  The idea of it was cheesy, and the movie lived up to that expectation.  I guess you can watch it if you're bored.  I dare you to base a school report about Lincoln on it!
B008518MOW|5.0|Great picture, sound actors, plot...everything you want in a 3d movie. I also like the fact that it comes with a BluRay disc and a regular DVD...
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|This movie had almost none of the same characters.  Even Duke hardly has any screen time!  It seems like they threw together the same old action movie cast and slapped &#34;GI Joe&#34; on it for guaranteed ticket sales.  I should mention, though, Bruce Willis is great and deserves better than this.  Also, Byung-hun Lee was good in RED 2.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|As a fan of epic fantasy series I was blown away by Brandon Sanderson's first installment of the Stormlight Archive.  From the very beginning I was drawn into the characters.  I can't wait for the next installment!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|One of those timeless tales, and one of Disney's finest hours, `The Jungle Book' is one of the best examples of the Disney canon that is NOT centered on a princess.  There is nothing wrong with princesses in my book (I've got two of them) but there is something special about a family film that reaches both genders in a way that isn't centered on love interests and royalty.  Teaching valuable lessons with a humble setting is what `The Jungle Book' is all about, and this dazzling 1967 film is top notch, for sure.<br /><br />The film tells that familiar tale of young Mowgli, a young boy raised by animals and segregated from civilization.  Threatened by the evil Shere Khan (a tiger), Mowgli's friends Baloo and Bagheera try and convince him to leave the jungle and join a nearby village.  Baloo, the boisterous and lovable bear, takes a stab at convincing the young boy to leave, but the fun they have makes the decision all the harder for the young boy, and Baloo.<br /><br />The film is one great moment after the other, and is filled to the brim with memorable songs and sequences, characters and sentimental life lessons that make the enjoyment factor VERY high with this one.  In fact, as an adult one can really take in this film and appreciate it on another level.  The themes of friendship and loyalty are strong here, and the bond that forms between Mowgli and Baloo is something special, and something that all ages will feel connected to.<br /><br />With splendid animation and songs that will remain with you year after year after year, `The Jungle Book' is a swinging good time to be had for the whole family.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I use this interchangeably with a Bose bluetooth.  This one has much better battery life, and I like the easy to use voice commands.  While this is bulkier than the Bose, it is still very comfortable. Easy on/off switch makes it very clear when the unit is turned on.  Also allows you to answer a call by saying, &#34;Answer,&#34; and that's a convenience.  I think the sound quality on the Bose is a little better, more crisp.  My voice on this tends to sound deeper than it is.
B00EHAIHWM|1.0|First let me start off with how disappointed I am with this album. ___________________<br />thats my silence and it speaks volumes, now on to the rating system I am forced to give it one star when i truly think it should get a zero.... MAN is this unoriginal and lame....save your ten dollars.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is very good for streaming contents from play store, youtube and netflix. The browser cast feature is quite useful at times. I just hope google allows for streaming of media from phone, tablet and pc as well.
B0031RS8UI|4.0|I liked this book a lot. The character is a bit different from the usual ones. A competent and very intelligent girl. It was a bit black and white: bad corporate world, good peaceful village. I liked more other books of Kinsella, but this was a very enjoyable reading that i recommend to all the one appreciating Kinsella.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Normally I am not a fan of sic-fi, but I must say, I do love these books! It kills me though that Jace and Clary think they are brother and sister! Have they never heard of a paternity test?? I love Mangus Bane, and Simon is alright. Was anyone else uncomfortable when him and Clary were \\"dating?\\" It felt so stiff and forced. I am dying to know how Madeleine is going to help Clary get out of her self induced coma. I am also wondering where Valentine went, he creeps me out but I kind of like him in an evil way. I was also upset to upon reading that the Inquisitor dies, i was starting to like her in a bitchy way. And FINALLY who are Valetine's real children. I have a hunch that he is Clary's father but def not Jace's.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|As the title say's. a few more music mixes, maybe a little less rain. Than, sure, 5 stars all the way.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|An action read from the start. Drama and excitement on every page. A story worth reading a second time around.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I've been meaning to read this book since first hearing of it when Marcus Luttrell was interviewed by Glenn Beck. Thank goodness I finally did, and I'll read it again, and buy a copy for my sons.<br /><br />Luttrell's ability to tell his story of Operation Redwing is truly engaging--you gobble this story up, try to identify in some tiny way with these tremendously brave men (and fail miserably) their unique mindset, their attitude, their focus. I could not put this book down. The appeal isn't just in &#34;another SEAL story&#34;--it's in the man-made-into-a-SEAL of the finest caliber. One who relates his family story, those who stood behind him, strangers, friends, and more--who waited anxiously to hear news of him after the loss of communication far away in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Throughout this book you'll be learning a little of the Afghan culture through Luttrell's eyes and heart clearly shows the diversity of the human spirit in this particular tribal society, and how they endured and fought the Taliban as well.<br /><br />Get this book, you won't regret it. If you have children, read it to them--let them understand the kind of determination and selfless dedication, Luttrell and the brave men he served with, had. They will be better people for it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator, it does what a normal calculator does, but has big buttons, easy to use and see.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Not much I can say about this one. Absolutely amazing! I loved it, sure it not my favourite out of the series but still well worth the money, is well written and my god does it finally answer so many questions. And hello! Can you get any hotter.<br /><br />I find it hard to write reviews for nalini Singh because let's be honest, she amazing and if you haven't read her books then you just can't call yourself a shifter lover. Nope not possible. The world she has created is just flawless, inspiring and makes you wonder what goes on in nalini's head on a every day basis.<br /><br />I do recommend that you read the books in order. For those who already have probably wont be reading these reviews and like myself just purchased it on blind trust. A trust that was not let down. How can you not give this five stars?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow this book was amazing!  It's a wonderful love story. I can't wait to read book two. This book is so much more deeper than the sex. It is more about Ana and Mr. Grey discovering love.
0871164566|4.0|I love the pendant ideas that this book features, but couldn't give it a 5 star rating because the instructions are kind of incomplete.  If you are an experienced wire wrapper and beader, you can try to figure out the designs based on the photos and some of the instructions.  If you are new to this kind of bead and wire work, this book is not for you.  I fall some where in between and since the designs are so nice, I'll give some of them a try and see how it works out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my FIRST book on my Kindle (which was a gift) and I loved it!!<br />I will be ordering another soon.  K
B0007PAMR4|5.0|The extra footage and story  telling in this version helps to fill in a few gaps the other version doesn't.<br />This is a little helpful, for those who did not read &#34;DUNE&#34;, by Frank Herbert
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Also it was too long. I like the idea of the movie but the execution was bad and waaaay to long. Half way in to my wife and I were looking at each other wondering when is this movie going to end. Too bad, with a better director, screenplay, and a even a little better supporting cast and the movie could have been a hit. Too bad. Sorry Dave, I think you did what you could...
B0026IUXO2|3.0|The acting was very good & the cinematography was also very good up to a point.  I felt it was a bit too graphic/bloody & turned my stomach a bit which is not necessary for a good historical drama as I have seen many of them.  Also the history was not accurate.  I don't think there is historical proof that Queen Elizabeth had carnal relations with Earl Robert Dudley although they were good friends & very fond of each other.  Elizabeth was too smart for that & she wouldn't have wanted to become pregnant out-of-wedlock.  Also she was never alone, having ladies in waiting & other court personnel constantly around her person. She was also aware that the Earl was married to Amy Robsart. Robert Dudley was politically ambitious & most likely used his relationship with Elizabeth to further his cause at court.  Also the film portrayed Elizabeth as uncertain of herself & weak, & as Henry VIII's daughter I'm sure she was much more in command - she had to be in order to survive - which she did quite well.  I prefer Glenda Jackson's portrayal of Elizabeth as more historically accurate & how a queen would comport  herself.  There was too much emphasis on the erroneus sexual aspect between Dudley & Elizabeth & the scene of the French prince in drag I found obnoxious, & this was not historically accurate either.  The musical score was good, although not quite historically accurate however, blending Mozart with Elizabethan music. I would not recommend this historically inaccurate movie for purchase, but for those who like the actors in the drama & like visual effects & are not sticklers for history it might be worth a viewing.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little gadget is small, lightweight, and fits easily in a pocket, purse, or survival kits of various types, and puts a great sharp edge on every knife I've used it on, from small old pocket knives to larger camping knives. For the price, you can't go wrong.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I am really disappointed that it only gives you 15min to play. you don't have time to do anything.... just a bother waste of time.
0061251321|1.0|The notion that groups of 20-150 people within a company that come together on their own rather than through management decisions--and THEN how executives can use those communities to maximize productivity and profit is just another form of instrumentalism, isn't it?<br /><br />First of all, one sees the forming of community.  That alone should be rewarding in its own right, much as virtue can be.  But then, this \\"good thing\\" (a self-forming community based upon shared values, beliefs, and norms) gets employed for the purpose of profit and productivity.<br /><br />(Oh, great.)<br /><br />This is another extension of using people as instruments for bourgeois, economic, rational purposes.  We have plenty of those prescriptions.  OD, strategy, OB, economics, finance, production, ops, etc. are full of those prescriptions.  We get it.<br /><br />How about another level of understanding . . . something that is more empathetic, something deeper than just serving the objectives of profit-maximization, self-interest, and productivity?<br /><br />All organizations are communities. Should those be their sole purposes?  Is that what we are or have become?<br /><br />Tribal Man experienced existence so much differently (see depth psychologist, Erich Neumann).  Tribal Man found his existence as part and parcel of a whole, in a truly magical world of open-ended associations, emotions, and being, where the entire world was experienced as a whole.  It was a different state of consciousness than anything so instrumental, rational, and objective as what this book shows us.<br /><br />I'm bored.  Anyone got anything really new to show us about organization as a community, one that purports to recognize being, rather than doing?<br /><br />I doubt the authors really understand the experience of \\"innocent wonderment--life is great.\\"  If they did, they'd not be telling us how to increase an organizations productivity or its profits.  They'd be talking about something else entirely.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Good time waster. Play it everyday. Don't have to purchase in game to advance. But it can get slow after awhile.
B001XVD21Y|5.0|Great remake of a Asian instant classic. Watch both if u can. But The Departed is a don't miss.  Very American remake without the emotional ending of the original.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Having seen several stage versions of Les Miserables the movie was able to do what the stage versions only hinted at.  Russell Crowe, surprisingly, gave a great performance.  I have been humming excerpts from Claude-Michel Schonberg's music since watching the movie.

B00634GHJA|5.0|When I purchased my iPad about a year ago, I experienced a lot of frustration trying to load my photos onto it by using iTunes.  A friend of mine recommended this Photo Transfer App and it's absolutely amazing how simple the process has become.  I have it now loaded onto my computer, cell phone and iPad and just love the versatility of being able to easily transfer my photos from one to the other.  An excellent product that I would recommend to everyone.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|So happy that she has escaped this terrible life and is healing.  Sad to see that so many chances to rescue this courageous girl were overlooked or not investigated as they should have been.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Well designed and is yet to crash, which appears to be a feature with some Kindle apps. Very easily mastered and a pleasure to use. The ads appear after every deal and require different ways to clear them which users can see as as much of a challenge as the games themselves but for me they are irritating but then you don't get owt for nowt!
B005ZI306S|5.0|I don't know if some of these superstitions are true or not, but they sure are entertaining.  The Author, Peter W. Collier, has a real bizarre imagination and writes small mini-stories in rhyme. Really great stuff like unlucky horseshoes, a really large bedbug named Dwight, and what's the proper way to eat a Gingerbread man.<br />Forget those pesky chain letters.<br />If your kids are having bad dreams, he's got the solution.<br />Well worth reading and fun.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I've been sick of all the Papa Roach (and their soundalikes) holding the hard rock torch the last few years, and now A7X has come out with some real music. The second half of the album may be the best string of 5 songs I've heard in several years.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|While it was sweet, I felt like a lot of pieces were missing. First, no way could she fall for him, the next he's in her bed. The love scenes were a little too explicit did me....gross.

B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I've recommended this to so many of my Baby-Boomer buds.  A fascinating history lesson -- with footage from the day -- based on this storied studio that I never knew existed before.  An easy doc to watch in several sittings, so you can dip in and out.
B0011Z33ES|5.0|Every single song on this album is good.  I can only say that about a few other musical artist that I listen to. I love Josh Groban, he sings so beautifully and his voice is so smooth.
B0090O07RS|5.0|This is an amazing restoration, but visually (looks like it could have been yesterday) and the music.  Many of the missing numbers have been replaced and the set is far looser than we were led to believe by the previous cut.  The bits from Celebration of the Lizard seem more balanced with the &#34;hits&#34; (especially with the restored &#34;Hello, I Love You&#34; back.)  Basically, this is as good as you're going to get.  Jim might have been very &#34;odd&#34; that night, but he's on when he needs to be on.
0307341577|5.0|Gillian Flynn rocks. This is the 3rd book of hers I have read.  I'm definitely a fan. This story has a twist you could never imagine.  Her mind must be a &#34;dark place&#34; for her to come up with these ideas. Great read.

I really don't care that I had to plug it into my TV's USB port, its behind my tv, I don't see it....not sure why people are complaining about that.  Who cares?!  I can't wait for more apps to support it, but for me netflix and the casting feature from my chrome browser made this a no-brainer at $35.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Beetle Juice is a proven movie for all times.  It's great for family viewing.  A great addition to any DVD Home Library.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|so I get it on my I- pod and it works fine but I try to get it on my kindle and I try to play and it just logs out.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The book was exciting from the very beginning. It peaked my interest from the start. Unfortunately it couldn't sustain the excitement and the love story was mediocre. Its all about falling in-love with the characters and this book didn't do that for me. I am on the fence about continuing the series.
B004J4WLB4|1.0|I found not a single character likable, and the writing style was unimpressive. Tedious and with no justification for the actions of the characters

B001N4RORE|1.0|Whew, and here I was despairing that I seem to be the only one who hated this vapid, idiotic film.  Mamma Mia (I omit their pointless puncuation) acts out in painful detail every narcissitic excuse for self-spectacle and a few I hadn't even thought of previously.<br />It's the kind of stupid film which actually IS bad for people. It effectively validates and perpetuates a wholesale disregard of local culture or thoughtful, reasonable social behaviour.  It is about nothing more or less than a gang of self-obssessed rich children playing on someone else's beach, indulging every whim and caprice without the slightest regard for others or their local environment.<br />Eeeeeesh, I feel like I've been wiped down with an oily cloth.<br />This film zooms to new #1 on my Most Hated Films list.
0718178130|3.0|I won this book through Goodreads First reads giveaways.<br /><br />I finished reading this book about a week ago.  It has taken me that long to determine whether or not I really liked it and what I should write in my review.<br /><br />Synopsis of story is as follows, extremely brilliant professor is looking for a wife.  Not so easy as said professor is (implied) on the high functioning level of autism, specifically aspergers.  What ensues is the 'comical' escapades of an uber type-A, O.C.D. personality looking for the same in a mate, so he comes up with the Wife Project.  Helping him along are his closest friends, a married couple in which the husband comes off as an aging, over sexed perv looking to have sex with women from every different country and his 'psychiatrist' wife who has agreed to this open marriage.<br /><br />In comes Rosie.  Of course it is kind of predictable that she is the antitheses to everything he is looking for however, our hapless professor is human enough to admit she is beautiful (but not for him).  This is a pretty predictable plot. The two are brought together on a quest to find Rosie's dad (the Father project) which leads to constant interaction and inevitably some kind of emotional connection.<br /><br />Did I like the book?  I didn't see anything glaringly wrong with it aside from the plot. Writing was fluid and flowed nicely. As for the characters, sure you feel for the two main protagonist asking yourself 'will he really understand his feelings for her' 'can she change him?' but, Don Tillman (the professor) is portrayed as being quite happy with who he is, why does he have to change? Tillman does come off as a bit of a joke, and I had to ask myself, why am I laughing at him?  Because he's different?<br /><br />Honestly, I'm still not sure about this one.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This series is fantastic!<br />No, it is not the comic book.<br />No, it is not an action packed roller coaster.<br />No, it is not a drama with a zombie costume.<br /><br />This is it's own story with twists and turns.<br />This is the best zombie/survival/human story we have on T.V<br />This is one of the few shows my wife and I can agree on.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A beautiful and well written book.  It gave me a new way of looking at the affects of a tormented life.  We never know why people react to situations.  It's not easy to trust when all has been taken away.  This shows the other side of what most of us take for granted.  Hats off to the author.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I liked it, but I think the next one will be a bit more up my alley, a little less conversation and a little more action if you please.
B006IGZWB2|3.0|I guess I was disappointed after all the hype. Not what I thought it was going to be. A strange mix of characature and on point.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Loved this series so far and I can't wait for the rest. I couldn't put it down,I would find myself up all night reading it.
B005C8ENI0|3.0|Pretty good movie for relaxed watching, late in the night. Don't expect it to blow your mind but it won't bore you either.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Man, I didn't some of the parts to some of the movies. This is a must have with all the extra Blu Ray features and video/sound quality.
B00BSBXA98|5.0|This movie was filmed in more than one location and is spectacular.  As with all the Cirque Du Soleil shows I've seen, the story line is loosely held together, but at the end, who cares?  I've watched 3 times so far and have enjoyed it each time.
0762434279|5.0|After receiving this book in the mail I was surprised at how small it was, but after reading it I thought it was definitely worth it.
B00CZAYNOC|4.0|I bought it for the single LIft me Up, and there are three more tracks that I really like, and four that are ok. I'm very picky about my music, though. It has to be great lyrics and terrific music. I also prefer just their original vocalist, I'm not a big fan of other people singing on their music, but I've loved Judas Priest for a long time, so Rob singing on Lift Me Up is just fine.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|It’s hard to believe that this film did not do well at the box office. I first saw it back in 1970 when I was in the Navy on a ship home ported in San Diego. The movie house was packed. Maybe it did well in that area due to the military/Navy influence in the area.<br /> What I do know is that this film blows some other war movies out of the water (Midway ~ a romantic scenario for what purpose; Battle of the Bulge ~ historically incorrect; The Longest Day ~ A good film also but too many big name stars detract from the films premise: Pearl Harbor ~ Instead of this tripe, if you’re looking for a love/war story watch From Here to Eternity instead).<br /> Pros:Tora Tora Tora stays with its intention all the way and delivers a knock out blow with some awesome special effect for it’s time.<br /> If you have this movie in another format, and own a blu-ray player, get this version. All but just a couple of scenes look amazingly better than the standard DVD copy I have.<br />Cons: The book leaves a lot to be desired, but I didn’t buy it for the book. The extended Japanese version doesn’t add anything of substance to the plot.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I didn't know if I'd like the show, but I bought the first season discounted, and loved it. The second season is just as good. They keep you guessing and just when you think you've figured something out, you get thrown. It's rare when I can't figure out the end, and this one's got me every time, which is probably why I like it so well.
0062255657|5.0|My husband and I listened to the audio version of the book during our daily commute to work and we were enchanted. We are big fans of Neil's work and this one didn't disappoint. For those of you who read his novels you will recognize his literary voice easily enough, and yet despite the child protagonist, it didn't make me once think of The Graveyard Book. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a delicious blend of creepy, coming of age, and the place that magic can (and should) hold in our lives. You wish the main character could hold on to that magic after learning what happens when you let go, but alas, that's not what growing up is about. Definitely an adult fairy tale of the first water.
B00DC3DGSK|4.0|I thought it was a little high priced when I bought it, but I didn't realize it was two cd's. No regrets, it's Buddy all the way. There are a few songs that I love and I like the rest of them.
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie was great! Better than I expected. Bring an amazon prime member is pretty awesome. You get the best in everything. I would definitely watch it again and is waiting for the next one to come out in theaters!
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|There are only three tracks that I really like. I can listen to the rest, but it's a little too repetitious for my taste. I do really like a lot of the music, the lyrics just didn't do much for me.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|No gimmicks, Amazon got my micro usb cord in a timely manner and now I am able to use my kindle again. Thanks to Amazon for taking care of me so quickly.
B00BAB6CNC|4.0|I really like five of the tracks and love two more, the rest is ok, but a little two slow for my taste. I definitely like it better than the House of Gold & Bones Vol.1.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|I choose this book because of the name...as an animal lover, I found this story to be very disturbing ... Not sure I'd recommend this book to any of my friends.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|This is a must see documentary for any music enthusiast. So many great bands and artists got their start at Sound City!
140120841X|5.0|I bought this because I loved the movie and I've always been a comic book enthusiast. This book blew me away. It's got some very noticeable differences from the movie, but I think they're both amazing. Of course the main story is much the same, but some differences are present. I could not put this book down. I read it non-stop until the very end and loved every minute of it. Some reviews portray it negatively due to the high and lofty ideals and wording used, and I've seen other reviewers say that the title character is inaccessible, but isn't that the point? V represents an idea, and cannot be contained by one physical, mortal body. On the contrary, Evey realizes that V's identity does not matter. I plan to read this story over and over, as it had quickly become one of my favorites.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|Great classic picture. Always recommened to rent or buy!! Great for the family!! Watch all of them! Turn the sound up.
B00DGQF0K0|3.0|This game has only ten chapters. The ads free one is identically the same as the free version except a tiny little ads bar which could be completely ignored. If you like this game, got for the free version and save your money. The reason I give only three stars is this game only has ten chapters and has not been updated for quite a while.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|$35 for wireless video streaming and 3 month Netflix subscription. What's not to like? Cheap, simple to set up and should only get better.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Plan to read mote books that she has wrote. It always keep me wanting to read more with the fighting and then love making.
B005R32L66|5.0|I use this app with Samsung Tab 10.1 without a hitch. Uses battery at a high rate. Also, could use a little more camera flexibility.
B00A7KKPDK|5.0|Ellen DeGeneres Seriously... I'm Kidding is one of my favorite books! It will have you laughing from start to finish!

B003L77FYS|5.0|I ma a big fan of the show and enjoy watching it more that just once. Can't wait for season five.
B00CUKTG2Q|5.0|If you love to the Franzs you are going to love this album. \\"Treason! Animals\\" pretty good song.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm going to listen to this cd over and over for a couple of months... it's quite addictive.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I like it very much but wish it had all the songs from the movie, (Diamonds are a Girls best Friend).
B00DT55OGS|3.0|I ordered this cd even in pre-order, like a good fan of B&S... but my expectations were not satisfied. I want to say is a good cd , it's good music anyway but anything over the average of B&S discography, I know this cd is gathering pieces of music left thru the path of B&S discography ... but it could have been better.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I ma a big fan of the show and enjoy watching it more that just once. Can't wait for season five.
B00D41H2PS|3.0|boat puzzle doesn't work for me. even followed a walkthrough video... paid for the game and can't. move forward. could be fun but very frustrated at this point

0767903862|5.0|As an Australian, I have to say that Bill Bryson (American) certainly captured the country very accurately. When I need some cultural reminders, I reread this book. It's also a good book to lend/give to anyone planning on visiting down under.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A very unique story...I loved it.<br />Enzo was a real person inside. Very insightful for a beloved pet.<br />You'll want to share this one with all your friends.
B008PZ69T8|1.0|thought I would really like this CD .I am very disappointed! very poor sound quality and I played it on my Boes. waste of my money.

B00CRMX53S|5.0|love this song! great beat, great lyrics, fun to dance to, really lucky to have bought this song, thanks for offering
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This has the capability to be a killer product.  Of course it does a great job as a streaming device for Netflix, YouTube, and Google Play Movies and TV, but it also (as of this writing) will play videos from my phone and DLNA network, via aVia Media Player Pro, which cost $2.99 in the Google Play store.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|I loved watching the show Dr. Quinn and have enjoyed being able to watch the series again from the beginning. The quality of the CD's have been good and I have not experienced the audio sync issues other reviewers warned about. I did notice that the quality of the CD boxes however from season 3 on are flimsy and reduced my rating down to 4 stars.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Purchased this tape for my husband, he is a big fan of Diana Krall and the tape stays in my CD Player so he can constantly listen to it, I also think it is a great tape, all the songs are worth listening to
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Many have probably purchased this micro-USB cable for the same reasons as I - we've misplaced our original charges, so we needed to get a new one, but wouldn't it also be nice to be able to drag and drop files from our computer to our Kindle as well?<br /><br />This charger does the trick, but iPhone users be forewarned - do not attempt to plug the USB end into your iPhone outlet adapter.  You will overheat both the cord and the adapter.  Amazon sells the adapter for this cord separately, but if you don't mind the rate at which your Kindle charges, simply plug it into your computer and leave it.  (If you do decide to use the iPhone adapter against good advice, let both cool down before you attempt to use either again in their intended capacities.)
B0020PJJHS|5.0|I am fan of Pierce Brosnan and his style of acting. This movie kept you on edge from beginning to end.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|this is a great album, love it.  I listen to it all the time.  It has several songs that are sure to be hits
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Works great with the Kindle HD. Very handy for planning ahead.  I'm very pleased with the app capabilities.  Three more words.
B00138KKP8|5.0|this artist is unique and always a jot to spend time listening to his music. I recommend listening to all of his music
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book was so good. I am not a reader and was referred this book to read. One of my first in about 20 years or so....I know a super ling time...I could not put it down.. it was sad , exciting .. recommend it ... you will love it!
B00127RAJY|5.0|love this, need to do better at it.  but it is a great video and a great workout even for me
B00ECUARO8|5.0|An awesome movie.  Well filmed and really well acted.  I enjoyed it so much I watched it two nights in a row.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|all I can say is awesome, this is the music I remember growing up listening to. my parents had this album
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Seriously so good! Watch it! I love the entire series. I will use the information in my every day life
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|To be honest, I don't play this game.  I downloaded it and gave it to my 5 year old.  He loves it.  So if you're looking for a fun game for your kid, and they like the movie.....look no further.
B000002KE2|5.0|I'm a long time Sabbath fan. One of the great productions featuring the original members. It never gets old, a timeless treasure for sure. Pure heavy metal fathers not matched by today's standards.
B00004RYZT|5.0|Live Aus Berlin is an amazing concert to have by Rammstein. If you live in the U.S. though I'm warning you now, the best song in the whole concert was removed because the US Government is so strict on shit like that they had it removed on US copies. Buck Dich was removed. So if you want to see the whole concert WITH Buck Dich on it, you gotta get the VHS copy.<br /><br />Why Buck Dich was Removed:<br />In 1998, Till Lindemann (Rammstein's vocalist) and Flake Lorenz (keyboardist) performed the Buck Dich act in Worcester, Massachusetts. The performance led to the two being arrested, hence why Rammstein never came back to the US after. Both were fined $200 and spent the night in jail.<br /><br />I say its ridiculous. You can also find the performance (Live Aus Berlin version) on YouTube. Just search &#34;Rammstein Buck Dich Live Aus Berlin&#34;
B008Y729FU|4.0|A classic good vs evil, revenge type movie plus more. Though it has been attempted to made into horrible sequels, nothing beats the original.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game.  Addicting and easy to start and stop depending on how much time you have.  Would recommend to a friend.

B003R0MEZ4|4.0|The service for receiving the DVD's is totally good and the quality of the product is also good. I can't say enough about the quality of the disks. Again another great job. I also fell for Criminal Minds through the reruns and kind of have the first 6 seasons now.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and can't believe I have to wait for the next one!  The ending just builds up so you want to read the next one.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this game is very fun and interesting it can get hard and it is also a great time killer. most of all it is addicicting!!
B0028MBKVG|2.0|I chose  his book because it was on the summer reading list for school.  Some of the book wasn't needed at all, it was just useless information that had nothing to do with the plot. So all in all it was only o.k.
B00CATONCA|3.0|I preordered the deluxe Blu-ray months ago and was eagerly waiting to set it up. Sad to say the cheap screw holding in the battery compartment was put in so tightly it was impossible to remove. The head immediately stripped since it's such cheap metal. I am in the process of trying to cut it out. One of the notches a head is supposed to clip onto is too thick so the head won't clip properly. One of the tank tops doesn't click securely into place meaning it's far from watertight. I realize it's Chinese junk but for $100 it should be better than what I'd expect from a $10 toy. That said I'm sure I'll thoroughly enjoy the Blu-rays but will be leary of springing extra for whatever deluxe packaging there is for season 4.
B00AW57L96|5.0|Could not put my Kindle down, had to keep reading to the end.  Liane Moriarty simply the best!!! Each book is better than the previous.  Can't wait for the next novel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|For anyone who loves Despicable Me, this game is addictive. Even if you don't love it, the game is addictive, so get it, son!

B00ABKGG0C|4.0|This was one of those stories you don't want to end.  I enjoyed the unique story line and how the author made many different aspects all come together in the telling.  Wish there was more!
B004N622EY|5.0|Very captivating, hard to put down, did not put down until early hours. Enjoy not knowing how it would end!
B003LSTK8G|4.0|Michael Lewis does an amazing job taking seemingly boring dry financial information and bringing it to life in an intriguing story telling format.<br /><br />Once I started this book I couldn't put it down.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|its awesome I can buy or sell with a flip of a finger.<br />I'm a seller and can easily manage my account anytime anywhere

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Bought on a wim, but has become highly addictive, would recommend to all horse and game lovers!<br /><br />Most appealing features include the ability to share game content/ achievements on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, being able to take part in competitions and win medals to advance in game and so on.
098555780X|4.0|Pictures and instructions are very clear and will enable you to tie these up in no time flat.  I use this in conjunction with his Youtube videos.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a very long book, but you will enjoy every bit of it if you are interested in history, Lincoln, or politics.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book was a springboard for me to get back to reading about the New Testament era as well as the deuterocanonical period.  I have had Josephus on my reading list, and this book gave me the nudge that I needed to slog through Whiston's classic translation.  For anyone interested in the conditions in  Galilee during the period of Yehoshua's (Jesus') life, this book will fill the bill.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app works great and is a great time waster! It's fun and doesn't freeze up like alot of these kind of apps do. Overall it's really great
B004UC4HCG|5.0|I just put together a relatively fancy compact PC with this as the box. Added the Intel i7-3770 processor, Lite-On 24x DVD writer, Seagate 2TB Barracuda 2TB drive, Corsair XMS3 2x4GB memory (8GB) and the EVGA Nvidia GT640 video card.<br /><br />All of this was done to be able to drive a QNIX QX2710 monitor at 2560x1440, in order to do some work and play some games.<br /><br />Everything works great together, right out of the box. It was very easy to install the CPU, heatsink, drives, memory, etc. Directions were well-written.<br /><br />The PC is very quiet (can barely hear it when placed under the desk), even with the video card added, because both fans automatically adjust to run only as much as needed. Sound, USB, and all the other features are smooth as butter.<br /><br />I'm writing this because I wished this information was available earlier: although Shuttle warns you that only a few video cards will work with it, there is plenty of wiggle room for many different cards, as their main concern is power consumption. The GT640 is a medium-power card with a full double slot design, but it still works fine. The whole system easily fits within the limits of the Shuttle's 300 watt power supply, even when playing CPU and graphic intensive games.<br /><br />At the AC plug, I measured about 35 watts when idling in Windows 7, 80-100 watts when doing CPU-intensive stuff like gaming, and under 1 watt in sleep mode. Pretty power-efficient, and nowhere close to exceeding the 300 watt PSU capability.<br /><br />Windows 7 experience rating for this particular system (maximum rating in each category is 7.9):<br />Processor 7.7<br />Memory 7.7<br />Graphics 7.1<br />Gaming Graphics 7.1<br />Primary Hard Disk 5.9
