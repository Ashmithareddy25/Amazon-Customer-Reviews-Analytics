B001AVCFK6|5.0|I am not a trekkie or trekker, I never have been.  This film successfully took something I had no previous knowledge of and made it \\"my thing.\\"  Star Trek is an amazing reboot that is space-loads of fun and takes itself every bit of seriously.  While being funny and fast-paced, Star Trek reaches to every strong emotion, and by the end I'm thinking \\"Why don't movies these days rock like this one?\\"<br /><br />The only previous knowledge I had of the early show and movies, was the casting.  Viewing the new film and witnessing how they tackled the casting was very dumbfounding.  The new film crew deserves so much of an applause for getting the best actors possible for these iconic roles.  Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, and all the others that were unfamiliar are now larger than life and put on one of the best shows of 2009.  This became one of the few movies that people returned to see again after a first viewing last year.<br /><br />What makes this movie so great is the action, comedy, style, pacing, and brilliant script.  I really have no bones to pick with it other than the obsessive flares that pass through the camera in nearly every scene.  Other than that this movie is grade A material that J.J. Abrahms should carry as the pride of his career.  Somehow I doubt they would be able to top it with a sequel, but I'd love them to prove me wrong.  No matter who you are or what you like, this movie will move you in some way.  It is my firm opinion that everyone should see this film, based on just how damn fun it is.

0446567337|4.0|So I really liked this book. I couldn't put it down.  As always written very well but a sad ending.
B001N44BW0|5.0|This movie is pure entertainment ... fast-moving, interesting, superb acting, just simply well-done. I suspect, as is the case with most excellent movies, it never sets out to make a statement or be politically correct.  Rather, it sets out to tell a tale, to provide a way to escape -- for just a bit -- from a world in which much of the reality of humanity is either so bleak as to be its own personal horror show or so boring it is the equivalent of one big global quaalude.

However, if you are seeking a DVD that offers very interesting perspectives from each musician and some noteworthy times of playing together, this is your DVD.

B00136JM6S|5.0|New York City Serenade,Kittys Back,Incident On 57th Street,and Rosalita. Stunning,moving,breathtaking,unequaled,greatest recording of 1973,and any other superlatives you may wish to add. Exactly what a 17 year old Senior from a small town Texas high school awash in a world of Journey and Kansas needed to restore his faith in Rock and Roll. I wish I would have discovered it in '73 as opposed to 1978. I had all but given up on Rock and Roll. Then,light emerged from the \\"Darkness\\". Yeah,the one from 'the edge of town'. Followed in rapid sucession by The Wild,the Innocent, and The E Street Shuffle','Greetings From Asbury Park' and 'Born To Run'. Yes, I realize they were not released in this order. But I digress. The most ambitious,intelligent work of the Bossman's early career. If you do not already have it,get it asap. With the exceptions of Walter Becker,Donald Fagen,and all things Lou Reed, this work was one of Rock's only saving graces from the early 1970's.

As Calaf, he is outstanding, and you don't even have to see the end of the opera to know that he's going to get the girl.  Marton is more than adequate as the titled character and Zeffirelli spared none of the Met's money to put on this lavish production.    Highly reccommended.
0385341008|4.0|Though it starts and finishes light and fluffy, Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows' The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society has surprising depth at its core.<br /><br />Suggested to me by my mom, this one sat for awhile on the TBR  pile. I remember when she first started it she wasn't that thrilled, and I guess that initial impression stayed with me, leading me to put it off & put it off.<br /><br />The novel is a series of letters, mostly to or from Juliet Ashton, a British writer just post WWII. She becomes pen pals with a number of residents of the channel island Guernsey, who formed a literary club during its German occupation. Through the correspondence, Miss Ashton becomes enamored with her new found friends and particularly intrigued by the person of Elizabeth, who inspired the creation of the club but has been lost since the end of the war. Due to her new affection, she visits the island, and during her visit decides to make Elizabeth the center of next literary venture.<br /><br />While this description may sound trivial, as indeed the book itself begins, what emerges from the letters are the survivor stories - tales of what it takes physically and emotionally to survive an enemies' occupation. Sending their children away to live in England, food rationing and the literal occupation of homes are some of the subjects of letters to Miss Ashton that make her want to learn more about these remarkable people.<br /><br />Inside these topics, humanity is revealed. The lengths a neighbor will go to to ease the suffering of another, acts of kindness that even the enemy can sometimes offer, when a child's belief in magic truly bolsters courage and the thrill gained just to know an enemy, unbeknownst to him, has been outwitted. These are the things of hope that reveal themselves in difficult circumstances.<br /><br />While this read isn't of huge literary merit, it is quick, light and interesting.  The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a worthy read, if for no other reason, like Sarah's Key, it educated me to a new piece of history and a previously unknown location.

0446569895|5.0|Could be the funniest book I ever read next to anything by Hunter S. Thompson.  LOL funny.  I was tearing up laughing so hard at one point and I am not half way thru the book.  Certainly for any Ozzy fan and anyone that is not offended by 4 letter words.  Lots of sex and drug references, every other page actually.  I am 50 years old and grew up listening to the Sabbs.

0312370849|3.0|It is not very often that a book can be carried by plot alone, but Sarah's Key is one of them. Tatiana de Rosnay's fictionalized account of Nazi-occupied Paris is praised by Holocaust survivors for the attention she brings to a lesser known tragic episode of the War.<br /><br />Her language is unremarkable, and the characters a bit flat. Many of the events she creates in present day are overly sentimental. However, I had never heard of the Vel' d'Hiv', and so I was mesmerized and intently curious about the story. Thus, the subject itself gives the novel the depth and texture necessary for a good read.<br /><br />In short, by orders of the Nazi government, in July of 1942, French Police rounded up more than 13,000 Jews living in Paris. For six days, they were housed in a stadium without food or water, much less appropriate living conditions. (Reminiscent of the stories we heard from those who stayed in the Super Dome after Katrina.) Then men were divided from women and children as they were shipped to several camps on the outskirts of Paris. From those camps, women were separated from their children, and all were taken to Auschwitz.<br /><br />Sarah's Key tells parallel stories - one of a young girl, Sarah, who, with her parents, is part of the round up; and the second, a journalist, Julia, in (almost) present day Paris who is writing a memorial to commemorate the 60-year anniversary of the events. In a contrived but expedient twist of fate, the apartment where Sarah's family was forced from is then occupied (and so owned) by the family of Julia's husband. When the story begins, Julia's architect husband is renovating the flat in preparation for moving his wife a daughter in. The narrative alternates between Sarah's story and Julia's discovery of and then search for Sarah.<br /><br />Sarah's Key refers to a key to a secret hiding place in their home - a space within the walls - where Sarah hides her younger brother when the police come. From the moment Sarah and her parents are taken away, she is intent on getting back home to free her brother from the locked hideaway.<br /><br />At just under 300 pages, this is a quick and worthy read - despite its shortcomings.[[ASIN:0312370849 Sarah's Key]]intent on getting back home to free her brother from the locked hideaway.

B002Q4TKAY|5.0|The Killers - Live From Royal Albert Hall is an excellent concert video, revealing The Killers as brilliant musicians, both individually and in ensemble. Ronnie Vannucci's drums beat at the center of this astounding group like the steady heart of a seasoned jazz musician: always alive, always responsive to the band, always in perfectly chosen tempo.

0743289692|4.0|So I finally finished Infidel, and I still hold to the opinion that this book is not a great literary piece. The monotonous rhythm of events never changed. So, while I know all the names of these people who were important and influential in her life, I don't have a 'sense' of any of them.<br /><br />It was interesting, though, following her rise and the literal politics of how one goes from being a Somali refugee to a member of Holland's parliament. And, I was really interested in her message. In a world where it is so politically incorrect to speak against a specific religion, Ali lives every day in fear of her life for what she has exposed about what Islam teaches to Muslims.<br /><br />In 2004, Ali made a short film with a producer called Submission. In it, four women represent four types of oppression that she feels Islam perpetuates - total submission to men, arranged marriages, physical abuse and sexual abuse. (The last female is a young girl who was raped by her uncle, but is now pregnant and so will be punished for having sex outside of marriage.) She uses verses from the Quran that she feels supports the oppression.<br /><br />The producer who helped Ali with this film was murdered two months after its release in broad daylight - a knife plunged into his chest stabbed a five-page letter of warning addressed to Ali.<br /><br />She says the world would be outraged if it new how many honor killings occur today. And, \\"[t]he fact is that hundreds of millions of women around the world live in forced marriages, and six thousand small girls are excised every day.\\"<br /><br />So she has dedicated her life to giving a voice to all the Muslim women who are oppressed, abused and silenced.<br /><br />It is one thing for a person of means to learn of someone's plight and spend the rest of their life fighting for a cause of the weak and helpless.

B002T9H2LA|3.0|I enjoyed the movie and the great acting.    But, I think that they over did the graphic violence.  They could have had the same movie without the violence(graphic scalping and Al Capone like bat bashing brains.)  Just because violence exists, does not mean we have to see it.  Is it possible to make a comedy with this level of violence?
0783225857|4.0|1962's To Kill A Mockingbird spreads its wings to great lengths with seamless effort in underlining the trials and tribulations of a society suffering from social prejudices. Its narrator, the overall-wearing, lovable tomboy Scout Finch (Mary Badham), describes the challenges she and her family face when her father decides to defend a black man charged with a serious crime.  Through her eyes, you see the clear divide that begins to grow in Maycomb County.      Originally adapted from the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee, director Robert Mulligan reveals his vision of the classic when the picture opens with a monologue from a seemingly grown-up Scout.  The introduction presents us with information on the somewhat artificial and judgmental Maycomb.  The frame is focused on an all-American, southern neighborhood where citizens open their homes to all, except for the Radleys.  Mystery constantly surrounds their dilapidated home as gossip and tall tales run high in the town; it does not help that the youngest of the family, Boo (Robert Duvall), constantly hides from the outside world in the security of his rundown haven.    In the movie's beginnings, we are introduced to Scout, Jem, and Atticus Finch, a prominent family in the southern town.  Played by Gregory Peck, Atticus serves as the county's best defense lawyer.  Peck brilliantly portrays the classy, respectable single parent described in the Harper Lee original.  Atticus is a character that demands respect both on paper and on screen, and the multi-talented Peck delivers this attitude.  His calm demeanor and noble ways add to the character development in the film.       Controversy surrounds the family when Atticus chooses to take the case of and defend Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), who Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox Paxton) claims assaulted her.  The tension between the word of a black person versus the word of a white person is depicted perfectly by Mulligan when the controversial case goes to court.  Thesmall courthouse not equipped for many people is suddenly packed with eager onlookers.  When the case begins, Atticus asks Tom Robinson subtle, honest questions and receives truthful answers in return.  When Mayella takes the stand, however, her over dramatic shrieks and tearful sobs take away from the validity of her testimony as well as that of her emotions.  Nonetheless, it is well known throughout the movie that the jury still favors Mayella because of the color of her skin.  The verdict of the case has nothing to do with the facts being brought up by the prosecution and defense; the verdict is solely based on social injustices.    Furthermore, under the black and white color pictures lie common events within a family that make the movie relatable to all; Atticus tries avidly to do the right thing, Jem strives to make his father proud, and most evidently, Scout endures the difficult process of becoming and understanding what it means to be a lady.  Not everything is as perfect and plain as it seems though.  The movie packs its share of tragedies; however, it remains inspirationally uplifting in the simplicity of its message.  Atticus's plans for the trial come to an unexpected halt, but his positive, sensible mind helps him come to terms with the outcomes of the whole debacle.      All of the characters come to a climactic clash at the end of the film when Boo Radley makes an unanticipated appearance, Mayella's father Bob goes after the Finch children, and Jem breaks his arm.  The sensation from the film's conclusion fills audiences everywhere with content and motivates them to be as noble as Atticus Finch in their daily lives.  In this intense yet satisfying ending, we see the invariable nature of humans to disagree, but the positive consequences for those who rise above.

B002TO1Z8Q|2.0|I loved George Michael since WHAM! FANTASTIC...He is a pop music genious--writes great songs in various genres, produces, plays instruments and has an outstanding voice....on studio recordings...    I've seen George Michael sing live on WHAM! In China, LIVE AID, On a concert on Disney in the 1990's, but, I just don't think he is that great live..I've never seen him in concert in an arena, but what I've seen on film--he just doesn't impress live on these performances I've mentioned, nor on this 1st ever live full concert dvd...    The set list was OKAY--would have wanted more songs from Older and Faith, but...It's just through the concert, he seems to depend too much on his background singers and audience participation than singing the songs himself...And he never stays with the same style when he sings live as the songs were originally recorded--I will say, that many of the songs musicly sounded close to the studio versions...And he'd sing like back to back versions of the same song--but with different arrangements (remixed/ like with I'm your Man and Spinning the Wheel--when he could have fit in maybe another song or two in the setlist)--The lighting and the stage is also just too busy on this concert---I thought I'd have a seizure watching all these LCD lights all over the place!       The best I ever heard/seen George Michael live was when he did the MTV Unplugged in 1996...I had to buy many import Singles/EP releases to get those songs from the show to add to my collection and wish he would release THAT concert on DVD--for that's the only memorable live performance I've seen him do...To watch George Michael \\"Perform\\", I'll stick to watching his 25 Music Video DVD collection...It's sad when you think a musician/band doesn't sound that good live when you attend a concert, but I think it's even WORST when they dissappoint on a live cd or dvd where the musician can actually have the opportunity to tweak and overdub the product in a studio.....And not for nothing, but doesn't George now resemble Clair's Father on the TV show Heroes?...Whatever--Again, if you want a great George Michael DVD, I'd say skip this one and go with the 25 Music Video Collection--Better setlist of songs, better footage and you can have a fun nostalgic trip watching videos from the WHAM! and FAITH era videos from the 1980s!

0142410705|5.0|I just finished John Green's \\"An Abundance of Katherines,\\" and I have to say... it's a fantastic book that thoroughly deserves that pretty silver award on the cover.  Folks looking for good YA books or good literature in general should look no further than this book.  It's clever, insightful, emotional, and simply well done.    That being said, it's also John Green's weakest effort.    I hear the choruses of \\"wait, I don't get it, I thought you loved it.\\"  I did.  Totally.  Only thing is, John Green also wrote [[ASIN:014241221X Looking for Alaska]] and [[ASIN:014241493X Paper Towns]], which are two of the best books I've ever read.  Green's worst is still some of the best young adult literature there is to read.  While it does drag in the beginning, and Colin and Hassan aren't as instantly enthralling as the cast of Green's other two books, before long, I found myself engaged in their odd journey.  Green's smart and funny prose helps keep this entertaining throughout.    Peppered with footnotes throughout and a lingo between Hassan and Colin that is as realistic as any lingo any pair of friends have (you should hear the strange words my friends and I cook up), it's also John Green's oddest novel.  There is some bizarre description and out-there reasoning that really helps flesh out the characters and spice up the narrative.  In the end, I put down the book and felt that I was slightly better for having read this story and the insight into the human condition that it contains... and if that's not a great thing to take away from a novel, I don't know what it is.    Thank again, John!    9/10

B002YOKVU4|4.0|I have been a Hunter Thompson reader and fan for years.  I saw this film when it was released in the local cinema and fell in love with it.  The entire movie is a masterpiece and will not disappoint if you are in any way shape or form a fan of Hunter's writing.  The movie pays an honest and humble homage to the book.  Hunter's writing was extremely visual to begin with and therefore a challenge to put to screen.  And in my opinion it was done near-flawlessly.  Fret not, all the lewd, lascivious, and what is now politically incorrect behavior are present in the movie.  And done so with respect for the book as well as the most scrutinizing fan.  But if you're reading this review then you're most likely familiar with the movie itself and have long since formed your own opinions about it.  That being said, how about this \\"new\\" BluRay release?    This movie was indeed released on BluRay long before the US release.  And it was not too expensive in online auction sites and was even available here, though not sold by Amazon, for months now.  So, you already own the overseas version and want to know if you should upgrade to the newer official US release?      In short, don't bother.  As far as I can tell they are exactly the same.    The video:  BluRay release of this movie is not by any means a reference quality print.  However, this may well be due to the original film's look and not the fault of a shoddy transfer.  Some of the blacks are a bit washed out, some of the colors are not entirely true...especially noticeable in the flesh tones at some points.  That's not to say that the DVD is lackluster in appearance.  Though there are flaws throughout, they are all minor and none of them will make you regret the price of the DVD.  Actually, compared to the Criterion Edition I own, this transfer stands superior and is the one to watch of the two.      The audio:  The film's audio is a marked improvement over it's standard DVD releases.  However, it's still not quite as \\"natural\\" as I would have liked it.  I'm not sure how much of this is the way the movie was initially produced and how much of it is the transfer.  My guess is this is as good as it gets and is probably as true to the original soundtrack is you'll get.   And is most likely the way it was meant to be heard in the cinema.      Is it worth upgrading if you had already purchased the BluRay before the Feb 2nd release date?  Not in my opinion.  The packaging is slightly different.  The menu is slightly different.  But short of that it's identical to the earlier BluRay release.      In conclusion, of all the DVD releases this movie has gone through, either of the BluRay releases will be your best choice by far.  It's not an amazing transfer, but best around to date.

Anyway, that led me to checking out this book from my library.  I'll admit that I heavily skimmed the book but what I got out of it was this- Victoria is funny, surprisingly down to earth and kind of modest.  What I liked best about her is that I did not at all get the feeling like she thought everyone needed to be as thin as she is to look good in clothes (even if she really does!) or to spend tons of money.  She gave tips that would work with anything, like the right length of your jeans, whether you are in heels or sneakers.
B002UPA4ZY|1.0|When you buy the more expensive CD, it says it includes the DVD of the TV special. When you get it, it is only 4 songs from that DVD. So now you have paid extra for the CD and you still have to go buy the DVD. So, because of Amazon's bad description of the CD, I have paid more by going to Amazon, instead of less.     The CD is great. Way better than watching it on TV with pledge week interruptions.
B000REYUKU|4.0|A solid product that dramatically decreases the time between flashes. My only gripe about the product is that the plug and corresponding port on the Canon flashes faces outward, causing the cord to extend towards the front of the camera instead of the back. It's not a huge deal and maybe I'm being a little picky.<br /><br />It's a solid investment for event photographers. Also comes in handy if you happen to need an extra AA battery - as there are always 8 sitting in your camera bag.

B002EQA0Y4|1.0|This is an awful product. The quality of the movie/image is very bad, like an illegal copy of a DVD copied million times and almost destroyed. The image isn't sharp at all and the colors are very bad quality, very watery. The cover of the box doesn't contain any traditional information about the movie aside from a very short synopsis; it lack absolutely any information about the director, names of the actors, year of production, etc. This is an awful, bootleg-quality like product, and I would never buy it had i known it earlier.

044024367X|1.0|Well, this felt as though Lee Child decided to write a book to air his political and religious views! I loved his other book but this one became a vehicle for the author's opinions. Reacher trudges back and forth to a metal plant and along the way finds common cause with army deserters. What? Are you kidding? I simply found this totally unbelievable in terms of character and plot.

B00275EGWY|2.0|Some interesting cinematography and occasional artful suspense, but the plot was contrived and mundane in the extreme, and where it was just free-floating (almost improvised and documentary like), it was boring. There simply was much too much dead space.<br /><br />With the format chosen (which granted was daring), the film could ill-afford to just take the low road and become another \\"Bad Boy\\" military hero story. It needed to jump into another orbit of creativity, and here it did not. Instead, it hewed much too closely to the old tried and true hero's script.<br /><br />Since there was so much talk about Bigelow possibly winning an award for best director, I was hoping to join the bandwagon, but I expected a lot more and frankly was very disappointed. Two stars

0440241030|4.0|The old joke about the TV series Murder, She Wrote, was that the small town that heroine Jessica Fletcher lived in had an exceptionally high murder rate.  What was it about her that seemed to result in murders occurring in her vicinity?  Obviously, it was just necessary to move the plot forward.  Similarly, what is it about Jack Reacher that he can just happen upon crimes?  In many books in the Reacher series, he just happens to be in the right place at the right time.    Such is the case in The Hard Way.  Since Reacher happened to be drinking coffee at the same place two days in a row, he was able to witness a man get into a car and be around later to tell others about it when they check up on it.  It turns out the man who got in the car was a kidnapper who took the wife and child of Edward Lane.    Lane is a wealthy man, having picked up lots of money by running a small private military organization.  These ex-soldier-turned-mercenaries are good in a fight but not so adept at investigation, so Lane hires Reacher to get his wife and daughter back.  Reacher is able to piece some things together reasonably quickly, including a few side bits of information, such as the fact that Lane is a pretty unpleasant person.    While Lee Child has written another fun suspense novel, The Hard Way also is not as clever as it could be.  I was able to figure out many of the twists well before their reveals and I doubt I'm alone; the result is that it makes the usually astute Reacher seem somewhat dense at times.  Nonetheless, this will be a worthwhile read for fans of the series.

0571191665|4.0|The Tango Lesson tells the story of a woman who wants to learn to tango. She moves to Buenos Aries to study with Pablo. She gets an apartment, buys her dance shoes, and is ready to go. After this we see time compression. Sally learns to move, to do ganchos (kicks), ochos (fans), and impressive cortes (dips and oversways) in no time flat. Well, this IS a movie. They also fall in love. They dance tango, milongas, and valse ( fast tango waltz). The variety adds much for tango lovers. The soundtrack contains classic tango music by great tango orchestras. In the end, when Sally has to perform with Pablo, she does a pretty good job. But she commits the lethal sin of dancing. She doesn't give up control. Pablo storms off the stage, and into the dressing room. When Sally asks him what's wrong, Pablo says, you didn't let me express myself. When a woman can't follow a dancer, it's no fun for either person. (Pablo Veron plays himself in this movie.)<br /><br />I agree, Sally is not an actress. She's rather plain looking, but she dances OK. Given this film is about learning to tango, she did a great job!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I often wonder why people have to review a film by writing and writing and writing, explaining every little detail and \\"their\\" perception of everything.  There really is NO need to do this because most of these people pride themselves, I guess, on being a guru of sorts about everything from how it was shot and just how good or bad the actors were.  PLEASE!  Get off the horse and just go and enjoy a movie for a change!!!!  Hello!  This was a great movie, the acting was great, the premise was great, and it was a first of its kind.  People, if you have not seen it, just go and see it (period).  And, just enjoy it for all it has to give.

1594488916|4.0|This is a very engaging book for bibliophiles.  It starts out like a detective story or thriller novel about the inside world of rare book collecting and theft, with a self-styled \\"bibliodick\\" hunting down an elusive criminal mastermind who purloins valuable rare books from bookshops.  We learn about the nuances of the trade and interesting tidbits about the world of antique book collecting.<br /><br />However, the story rapidly loses steam as we learn that the identity of the criminal is known, and that he isn't such a \\"mastermind\\" after all but simply a garden-variety sociopath, a con man who happens to steal books instead of committing other more violent or high-profile crimes.  And he's not even all that good at his deceptions, getting caught and sentenced repeatedly, he just benefits from the relative indifference of an overburdened criminal justice system and the fact that his crimes are only against \\"property.\\"  About midway through, the book shifts focus to an in-depth study of this individual's self-justifying mentality, his past, and his techniques, and with a growing revulsion and anger we realize that not only will most of his many victims never be recompensed, but by reading the story we are facilitating his desire for admiration as he looks forward to people reading about him.  (He doesn't steal the books to read them, but just to \\"have\\" them for the way they will make him feel refined and intellectual - and for the way taking these books from others compensates for life's \\"unfairness.\\")<br /><br />The book is a fast read and is engaging and interesting, but would have been better if it focused more on the world of investigating rare book theft and not so much on the activities of one individual.  However, there is good inspirational material for a murder mystery or two here.<br /><br />The book leaves one with a slightly disgusted feeling, and a realization of the value and importance of simple character and integrity, doing the right thing whether one can be caught or not.  The author reveals that she herself has come into possession of a stolen book, which she procrastinates about returning to the library that owns it.  Just because a book is no longer on record doesn't mean that it shouldn't be returned, or \\"re-donated,\\" if necessary.  Warped self-love can easily find any pretext to justify doing whatever one likes, indifferent to the common good, in each daily decision.  In that, the author and her primary subject are uncomfortably similar, as are we all..

0545123267|5.0|I had pretty high expectations when I started this book, and I am pleased to say that this book was able to meet all of them. It was one of the sweetest, purest romance books I've read in some time. I loved it.    The writing was superb. Stiefvater obviously knows how to write, and the story was enhanced by her ability to describe emotions and settings. I was never bored by her language and the cursing was kept to a minimum, which I appreciate. For me, it ruins the book whenever an author uses a large amount of explicit language. I also appreciated the maturity level of the writing- this book may be categorized as a young adult novel, but the writing is never condescending.     In the beginning, I had a hard time bonding with the main character, Grace, but by the time I was halfway done with the book, I felt a strong connection with her. She is both relatable and realistic. I absolutely adored Sam. For once, he wasn't the dark bad-boy with a mysterious past. His innocence and respect for Grace made him all the more endearing. Unlike many of the boys in young adult books, this is one of the boys that is really good for the girl. Supportive, self-less, and loving. Sam is the perfect yet believably realistic guy.    For the first part of the book, I kept asking myself where the plot was going. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, but then what? It did take a while for the story to unfold, but there was a good plot underneath the teenage romance. Parts of the werewolf legends were familiar, but Stiefvater puts a new spin on the wolves. No Twilight-wannabe werewolves here.     Shiver was a very enjoyable, romantic read. If you're looking for a sweet story about star-crossed lovers, this is the book for you. I will definitely be picking up the sequel, Linger. The ending to Shiver was so abrupt! I'm dying for a sequel.

0375703764|1.0|I think this guy took everything he scribbled down for like ten years and compiled it into this big stack of nonsense. There is only one good idea, the kind of Twilight Zone-esque idea of a house with the mysteriously large closet, but oh no, you won't be reading much about that. Its about 98 percent gimmicky footnotes and pseudo-scholarly garbage (which the author himself pokes fun at in the book, but...its a main chunk of the book so whats the point of writing in a style for so many pages if he knows its no good).    The alternate story of Johnny Truant I'm convinced was a separate manuscript that I think the author decided to merge with the story of the house to... I don't know, make it longer? That story is crap as well. I aborted the expedition about 250 pages in, about 200 pages further than I should have gone. There was probably a solid short story to be found in there with the house but...needless to say, my mind was not blown.    Try Gravity's Rainbow instead if your looking for 700 pages of rambling that won't leave you feeling burned.
B002RVZV9U|4.0|If you like Jimmy Page, Jack White, or The Edge, it will be difficult not to like this movie.  \\"It Might Get Loud\\" shows the charm and charisma that all three of these men possess in excess.  It also displays their potent talent over and over again, much to my delight.  The film is not perfect, it does get a bit sappy from time to time, usually when trying to connect the stories of the three together instead of letting their stories stand as they are, unconnected.  Overall though, it's a tremendous film.  It does feel like Jack White runs away with the film to a degree.  He has the only acted part in the whole movie, tears it up with an improvised Diddley Bow electric slide guitar, comes up with an original song for the film in just minutes, and is usually the lead vocalist when the three play together.  If you like Jack White, this is a must see.  If you like any of the three, you should probably watch it too.

B001OQCV6K|4.0|Theatrical Review, not the Blu Ray Edition<br /><br />I never read the books, never seen the British TV shows, but everyone is familiar with Sherlock Holmes, a literary character who has made it's way into American pop culuture. Such phrases as \\"You don't have to be Sherlock to figure that one out\\" witty sayings like that, you get my point.<br /><br />Anyways I am a Guy Ritchie fan, Robery Downely Jr also, so after Iron man and Tropic Thunder, Downey Jr is a hot commodity I see. But Downey Jr as Holmes and Jude Law as his side kick? I honestly thought the roles should have been reversed at first, I thought Downey would make for a better Watson really. After watching this film which does have Ritchie influence, slo mo shots, fast shots, quick edits, plus I think this is Ritchie's first big big budget movie backed by a big Studio.<br /><br />What a nice start off point for a potential franchise, the story itself is good, felt I've seen this type of story before, An evil occultist dies for the murder of 4 women I couldn't but think  was this a hint that Sherlock and Watson foiled Jack the Ripper and the killer all along was a man who believed in the occult? it is never implied that was the case... then again I could be totally wrong and the antagonist played by Mark Strong was just a bad guy who wants world domination. Anyways Lord Blackwood as his name is promises to to come back after his death... and so he does, this is where the game is afoot.<br /><br />Now Sherlock has to deal with this, deal with Watson getting married and soon leaving their shared Flat/ office. But as much as Watson gets ready to be done with Holmes he is pulled back in helping his friend, partner much to his chagrin. The interaction between RDJR and JL is what makes the movie work, their chemistry, their bickering, and banter between one another as they try to figure out how Lord Blackwood rose from his grave is great. As one can tell between their squabbles there is an underlying affection for one another, a said brother bond between them<br /><br />So through out the movie they are trying to solve said mystery. RDJR plays Sherlock very well, as an eccentric, smart, witty, charming, brash, manic depressive, detective using his skills to deduce the unplausible to plausible explainations, and he likes to go to under ground boxing matches using his wits on how to take down an opponent then using that physically, nicely played out to the tradiontal song of Rocky Road to Dublin, (this is where Ritchie's camera style comes in, slow mo shots and quick edits, it's reminscent of Snatch when Pitt is in the ring) Then Sherlock uses his winnings and gives to Watson who likes to gamble. Jude Law plays Watson as the voice of reason, this is how that interaction works between them, why I think the movie worked just because of RDJR and JL on screen chemistry. Even though Holmes insults Watson's future wife, experiments on his dog, takes his clothes, rarely bathes, speaks his mind openly, not realzing sometimes the consquences, sticks his nose up at Scotland yard and their Detectives, but somehow Scotland yard needs Holmes and his brilliant mind, where one scene a Detective punches Holmes, and says \\"I've always wanted to do that\\" shows how Holmes can get under people's skin, funny, scene indeed, but throughout all of this Watson sticks with him.<br /><br />My only problem we see Holmes and Watson try to figure out what Lord Blackwood is up too (wants to blow up Parliment and throw London into Chaos and have a new world order wow what a shocker, haven't seen that in a movie.. V for Vendetta, as I said plot/story wise a nice jump start to a Franchise where as always in a potential franchise the sequel ups the anty which I think we will see)<br />Not to spoil everything, Holmes deduces everything using his brains, my only quip some of the scientific stuff protrayed in the film, I don't know if it was around in the late 19th Century then again it's a movie.<br /><br />Oh yes and rachel mcadams plays holmes old flame who has something up her sleeve as well working for professor Moriarty who I do know is a character from the books and is Holmes nemisis.<br /><br />So, in essence it's a buddy cop movie set in Victorian London, worth checking out for the banter between the two main actors, you can tell Downey Jr and Law had fun, it shows through their performances.<br /><br />other notable buddy movies worth checking out: 48 Hours, Lethal Weapon, Rush Hour 2, Bullet Proof, Red Heat, Tango and Cash, and Bady Boys I and IImething up her sleeve as well working for professor Moriarty who I do know is a character from the books and is Holmes nemisis.    So, in essence it's a buddy cop movie set in Victorian London, worth checking out for the banter between the two main actors, you can tell Downey Jr and Law had fun, it shows through their performances.    other notable buddy movies worth checking out: 48 Hours, Lethal Weapon, Rush Hour 2, Bullet Proof, Red Heat, Tango and Cash, and Bady Boys I and II
B001NESPHC|5.0|Melody has a fabulous voice.  It has such a pretty sound to it and is totally under control.  I love this album, it is cool and jazzy, but a little folky and blue grassy as well.  You hear it once and you are instantly a fan.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|Fancy a heartbreak? Watch this film.<br /><br />Michael is a successful middle-aged lawyer with a restless personal life. He remembers his teenage youth when he met and had a short but passionate affair with his first love - a simple older woman who was living an orderly, dutiful but reclusive life. The age difference could be disturbing to some, but I think the woman being full of repressed feelings and individuality, she was on a similar emotional level as our teenage boy and used her sexual energy to experience some freedom through ecstasy.<br /><br />For pretty obvious reasons (to the viewer), she asks Michael to read books to her out loud. She is so keen to keep this particular reason a secret that she even causes great harm to herself protecting it.<br /><br />I know I'm talking in sign language here, but don't wanna spoil the story. So I'll end by saying that it really is worth watching. A tale about how sometimes doing your 'duty' for the lunatic people that run your country will be considered evil by later generations. A tale about a good man's inability to empathise and forgive. A tale about a good woman having her heart broken - not by the generation that had no mercy on her, but by the man that she had grown to believe in.

1584233494|4.0|I love the book. I'm a fan of Shepard Fairey and his book is wonderful, full of images on every page and a great look into his career and life as an artist, but a few days after I opened the book from its shrinkwrap, it started to curl or cup, making it a bit harder to flip through pages.  This surprised me as it is a hardcovered book, and I don't keep it in a wet environment.      Aside from this frustrating phenomenon, the book is a great buy and a wonderful price on amazon compared to almost twice the price at retail stores.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I was one of the most gung-ho Susan Boyle fans throughout the spring.  I fell in love with her and her story and rooted for her triumph daily when her rough patch occurred.  I ordered the CD before its release and ran to my player the minute I received it.    Although her voice is truly magical, I have to say that I am disappointed with the CD and have probably played it only three times.  She certainly does demonstrate her vocal control--but that is the problem.  I fell in love with a lusty, emotional performance style--a beautiful voice backed up by a great heart.  These performances are so polished that the whole thing becomes background music, more like Celtic Woman than our Susan.    I am pleased that financially this album has put her in a deserved place of comfort in her life.  But I hope the producers of the next album allow her to cut loose with some more raw vibrato than this sweetly done bit.  I want to hear the lions that come at night more than the cozy little kitty.  I would like to hear her interpretations of things ranging from Ave Maria to Climb Every Mountain and perhaps Danny Boy done in the immediate style of her first performance of I Dreamed a Dream!
B000005J56|4.0|If you like the BVSC movie you will like this cd just as much or more. Many of the songs on this cd are not in the movie and I have to say several of them should have been included in the movie, especially \\"Amor de Loca Juventad\\". Fans of the high energetic cuban dance music will find some of the songs tame in comparison but fans of gospel and Texas Swing will be please with the last 4 songs on the cd. Please buy and enjoy for many listening hours. A nice photo booklet giving the history of the composers and a translation of the lyrics is included.

0060555661|4.0|Two of the core types of investing are value and growth investing. Value investing looks to find commodities at a price lower than their value while growth investing looks to find commodities with the potential to become larger. If you're interested in learning about value investing, this is definitely a book to check out.    Originally published in 1949, the Intelligent Investor helped paved the way for value investors like Warren Buffet, who writes a preface for this revised edition. Even though II was created over 60 years ago, it's core concepts are still useful and true today.    The biggest negative about this book is that it's relatively old. It was revised by Graham as recently as 1973 and includes updates by Jason Zweig but the majority of the content in the book was written over 40 years ago. Another downside is that it can be kind of grueling to read. That often comes with this subject matter but readability would help. At any rate, despite these shortcomings, the Intelligent Investor is a core book to learn about value investing.

B001E3E16G|5.0|Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.<br /><br />This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.<br /><br />A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.<br /><br />Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.<br /><br />I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0783225857 To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0670010952 Harper Lee (Up Close)]]

B001LQCIC0|5.0|Allan Grey (Julian West) has a fertile imagination and we get to fertile along with him. He is on vacation. He chooses a strange building to vacate in. It is his first night and he hears a spooky sound (mostly in German) which forces him to lock his door. A mysterious man comes into his room any way and delivers a package. It is only to be opened on the stranger's death. Things only get weirder and as with any mystery it is always, the last person you suspect. Eventually the story comes to a \\"Grinding halt.\\"<br /><br />Well designed \\"they may be vampires\\" story. All the elements are there. If you miss the introduction, you will be lost in the montage. Actually considering that this film is over 75 years old and has had a rough shelf life, we are lucky to see what there is. Now the question is if this is re-mastered, will it lose its patina as rare coins do after a good dose of Bon Ami.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Clint Eastwood is brilliant as the racist, redneck widower who has no connection with his children or their children. His interaction with his \\"Gook\\" neighbours are heart-warming and funny at the same time. His confrontation with the baby-faced \\"virgin\\" priest is another highlight.   Recommended
B002PTHKNY|2.0|I haven't bought the album, as I've made the mistake with buying Pearl Jam albums before, but I have listened to every track over several sites, and I gotta say, If you're looking to throw money away on an entire disk of recycled 90's garbage for just one song that frikkin amazing, then this is the cd to do it with! I mean, there is literally only ONE song on this entire album (and it's a really really beautiful song) that's good, but I felt like putting my head through a brick wall when I listened to the rest of the tracks.<br /><br />Now \\"Just Breathe\\" is musically perfect; in it's harmony and it's soul and in it's ecclectic peacefulness... You can definitely see where Eddie Vedder has matured in his musical growth! If I could suggest an alternative to buying this album, it would be to pick up the stuff he did for the soundtrack to \\"Into The Wild\\"... It's EXACTLY done in the fashion of this track, and it has nothing you'd expect from Pearl Jam in it (which anyone with working ear drums knows that that is a very good thing!<br /><br />So, in conclusion, if you have to have \\"Just Breathe\\" for your MP3 player (which I have not been able to find without buying the whole album as of yet) then by all means, buy the album. But if you're like me and really don't like throwing money in the garbage disposal, then DON'T BUY THIS CD!!!<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!<br />Sincerely,<br />Kris Ramer
B001GKJ2DY|3.0|Although ostensibly a \\"chick flick\\" it is hard not to get into the happy-go-lucky spirit of this movie. Even if you weren't an ABBA fan the songs blend seamlessly into the story line and the cast, although not bless with great voices, manage largely to pull it off. Watch it with your partner and score good brownie points.  Recommended

0156027321|5.0|Pi, whose real name is Piscine Molitor, is a 16 year old boy from India who is forced to change and mature quickly when the boat he and his family were taking on their move to Canada sinks in the Pacific Ocean. This book goes into great detail about his ordeal; however, it also offers many ideas which inspire questions about faith and life in general. There is more than just a tale of survival here. You'll also find some insight into animal behavior and comparisons of religious beliefs.    If you read \\"Life of Pi\\", be sure to start with the foreword which outlines the structure of the book. The author has spoken with Pi in his home in Canada years after his ordeal at sea. From time to time, he provides glimpses into his current life; for the most part, he's telling Pi's story.     As a teenager, Pi begins to practice different religions. In addition to the Hindu faith he was born into, he discovers Catholicism and Islam. These passages provide an interesting comparison of the different religions and Pi questions why others want to force him into choosing just one. Pi's father is a zookeeper who decides to move his family, which also includes Pi's mother and brother, along with some of the animals from India to Canada to start a new life. Along the way, something causes the ship to sink and Pi finds himself alone on a lifeboat... with an injured zebra, a female orangutan, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Before too long, it's down to just Pi and Richard Parker, whom Pi decides to try to train. Tigers, like many animals, respect the alpha male in any group and Pi must somehow get Richard Parker to recognize him as the alpha.    Lost at sea for over 200 days, Pi must set aside his vegetarianism and eat anything he can find including turtles and fish. His life is often threatened by storms, sharks, dehydration, and lack of food. Pi is served well by his zookeeping knowledge from his father as well as his beliefs. The description of everything from catching fish and training the tiger to surviving out in the elements is so detailed one can easily picture it all.    It is amazing what one is capable of when survival is threatened. Parts of the story do come across as rather fantastic and hard to believe, but even those questions are dealt with. While the book is one of the more graphic books I've read, it is also one of the more thought-provoking ones. After reading it, I was left with some intriguing questions as well as some knowledge and understanding.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|This boxed set of all of the Beatles mono recordings is simply awesome. I purchased this and then purchased the stereo Abbey Road, Yellow Submarine, and Let It Be albums remastered albums. It is a great way to get the entire catalog without buying both boxed sets.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I've read the Sword of Truth series several times since the initial release of Wizards First Rule in the 90's.  I love the characters, but feel Terry Goodkind lost his way in the later books (not an uncommon failing in modern fantasy writers; see Robert Jordan for the ultimate proof of totally losing your way after a few books).  I didn't realize that the SoT had been adapted for TV until I was browsing Netflix recently and ran across this series.  I've now watched the entire first season.  I know there is no practical way to faithfully adapt the books themselves.  Nor would I expect them to.  However, the flavor of the Midlands/Westland etc. is there.  They nailed the casting of Kahlan and I think Zedd's actor is also very good.  The actor playing Richard is not exactly the physical presence that I would have imagined, but he does a good job otherwise and certainly has a great chemistry with the actress playing Kahlan.  Darkan Rahl is well played; I do wish they'd kept him as Richard's father and not brother, but oh well.  Now, obviously the series has changed a lot of the concepts that were in the books.  Denna lives and is \\"evil\\".  The Mord Sith for some reason don't seem as menacing as in the books.  Probably a hard concept to translate to a TV series intended for family viewing.  There seem to be Rada'hans everywhere and a simple key is all it takes to unlock them.  I also wish the D'haran bond to Richard through the Rahl bloodline had been preserved as I think the growth he experiences in becoming a true leader after killing Darkan Rahl is an important aspect of the books.  BUT, despite all the changes, this is an enjoyable series to watch.  Think of it as an \\"alternate\\" universe to the books.  Given the production limitations of a syndicated TV show, I think they do a great job and some of the unique story lines (i.e. not found at all in the books) are fun/entertaining.  If you're willing to have an open mind about the story then you'll undoubtadly enjoy thisseries.  If you're a purist who can't stand many alterations from the book series then you shouldn't watch this show.  If you've never read the books, I highly recommend reading at least the first 3.  I love them up through Faith of the Fallen.
B000M341QE|4.0|I won't tell you the ending, but It's about the only bad thing about the movie.  Its like Martin ran out of money and said, \\"We just gotta end this thing!\\".  Other than that this is one of my favorite movies ever.  Jack delivers an amazing performance, as does Leo Dicaprio.  The quips that Mark Wahlberg let out are priceless!  This is one of the few times that an all star cast actually delivers on its promise.  If you are a fan of any of Scorsese's stuff then this shouldn't be any different.  One of his best.

For a rapper to try to even to attempt to make a rock album where the hooks and style of music is completely different, this cd is remarkable. I listen to this cd from start to finish and haven't been able to say that in a long time. His voice gets dubbed out in some portions of his songs but that is because he doensn't have a natural singing voice obviously , but i dont think it takes away from the song at all. lil wayne is one of the most talented music icons in the history of music and this only shows have talened of a musician he realy is!!!

B002UZCJP2|3.0|Picked this up after being interested by the trailer - looked like a fun movie that just got undeserved criticism.<br /><br />I have to agree with the others though - the movie was entertaining, but not as much as it could be. The idea wasn't unique and didn't really draw you in to the movie. The movie ran just under 90 minutes and left me with the feeling that this was a cut-down version of it (a 2-hour version might have worked better).<br /><br />The video and audio were very good (especially considering it's a recent release with a bigger budget), the extras were decent (a couple features and a commentary) but not great. It's a nice demo disc, but not something you'd want to watch more than a couple times.<br /><br />Movie: * * * (out of 5)<br />Video: * * * * (out of 5)<br />Audio: * * * * (out of 5)<br />Extras * * * (out of 5)<br /><br />Overall: * * *  (out of 5)

B000ZELISO|4.0|I love Harry Potter. I am an adult HP freak.     This film is about average as far as the HP film series is concerned, better than Order of the Phoenix, but not up to the quality of Goblet of Fire or Prisoner of Azkaban. A lot of that has to do with the sometimes inexplicable writing and direction. Plot lines deviate from the book for no apparent reason, and others are created where the plot from the book would have been perfectly fine.    The young actors all do great to ok jobs. Bonnie Wright is especially wonderful in her portrayal of Ginny Weasley; although the budding romance between her and Harry is not developed as it is in the book, it's done sweetly and believably. Dan Radcliffe continues to grow as an actor, and there is no question that he is now capable of carrying a film. Emma Watson gives her best performance as Hermione Granger; she is excellent in the scene where she and Harry commiserate with each other about their unhappy love lives. Rupert Grint is adequate as Ron Weasley.    Technically the film is very good. it's the first one I've watched on Blu-ray, and it's quite enjoyable. I was told, before the Oscar nominations, that it would get a Cinematography nomination, and so it did. The music is ok, nothing special. Special effects are very good. One can only wish that, as I said, the direction and writing had been better.     I think that general audiences will love Half-Blood Prince, but that Harry Potter nerds like me will like it but wish it had remained truer to the book.

B000002MG1|5.0|I was at a 9th grade birthday party, for a girl named Brooke. I hardly knew her. Her brother put in a CD, which was still pretty novel in Alaska then. I had watched a few R.E.M. videos on MTV, but I hadn't really understood until I heard this album in its entirety. I fell in love. From the melodies to the album art, I was hooked. I have loved R.E.M. since that day. This particular album is R.E.M. at its best.
B00275EGWY|5.0|This is technically perfect movie, it's a direction achievement that needs to be applauded and appreciated.  I couldn't care less if this movie was set in Iraq or Pandora.  Each scene is setup where an element of uncertainty is introduced every few minutes to add to the tension.  If you got goose bumps or if you tensed up as a scene proceeded than that was the intention.  From that standpoint, I have not seen a movie or experienced one in a long time that delivered that kind of intensity.  So, kudos for Ms. Bigelow for directing this movie.
B000W796OM|3.0|I found this the least satisfactory of the films.  The new director apparently took it for granted that the audience had read the books and didn't find it important to explain things.   Not only that, he sabotaged the screenwriter's plot exposition: when Fudge is explaining the resolution of the Aunt Marge plot the director tries to distract the audience with a dancing hunchback; later when McGonagall explains Black's (supposed) crimes to Rosmerta, the director has Fudge blocking the view of the women talking.  Then Hermione just happens to have a time-travel charm on her necklace -- no explanation of how she got it, or why she didn't use it earlier.      Some good ideas: having the choir sing Shakespeare's \\"Someone wicked this way comes\\"; the talking head; the idea of having the students dress in normal clothes instead of robes during their off hours (presumably Rowling agreed, and the subsequent movies followed it up); Thewlis, with that sickly look, was the perfect choice for Lupin.  But the central story ought to make sense.
B000P5FH3K|2.0|maybe this is why my favorite movies are x-men and pirates of the caribbean.  maybe movie-writing has changed for the better in the past 10 years.  it just seemed platitudinal--either 'good guys' or 'bad guys' and plenty of obvious heart-tugging, even if for valid reasons.  just seemed like a hallmark special, and i'm not a fan of matt damon's southern accent most of the time.  can't fault the acting, but it was so slow!    plat·i·tude  (plt-td, -tyd)  n. 1.

B002V9PEU4|4.0|What happens when an action movie crosses over into the real world? That's the question explored in the early '90s cult action flick, Last Action Hero.<br /><br />Young Danny (Austin O'Brian) spends his time watching cheesy action flicks, particularly those by action star Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger). When an old projectionist gives Danny a magical ticket, Danny is transported into one of Jack's movies where the laws of physics (or reality) don't have much meaning. It seems like the perfect world for Danny until Jack's nemesis (Charles Dance) finds the magic ticket and enters into the real world. It's up to Danny and Jack to stop him, but without the luxury of movie magic.<br /><br />While many action movie fans (such as myself) will enjoy the cult nature of this movie, others will find it too corny and tongue-and-cheek. Last Action Hero, while expertly written and executed, is a parody of itself and of all (especially '80s) action movies, but in taking this route, has used too many \\"in\\" jokes. In fact, a few of the jokes even had to be explained to me, because I didn't understand all the little nuances of the screenplay. I can easily understand why some viewers won't enjoy the film's style of humor, but I can also see how it became a cult classic.<br /><br />The picture quality is absolutely phenomenal. It's so crisp and clear that, quality-size, it feels like a modern movie. The colors are so vivid that the film feels like it's jumping off the screen (almost literally, making the nature of the movie itself even more interesting). I've never seen this film (okay, so I missed the DVD version and only saw the VHS version) ever presented in such a beautiful way before.<br /><br />The sound has also been improved, and instead of having to turn the volume way up in order to hear anything outside of the action sequences, it was considerably more manageable. Between the picture and the sound, all of the over-the-top, corny action sequences really came to life hereand made me feel like I was part of the action (which seems to be a key aspect of the movie's original intent). Presented in crystal-clear 1080p high definition in 2.40:1 widescreen, this is the best quality Last Action Hero can ever have. This edition also has Spanish, French, and Portuguese audio as well as English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese subtitles.<br /><br />However, I found the bonus material here (or lack thereof) very disappointing. Now, since I've only see this movie before on VHS, I don't know what was included on the original DVD release (if anything), but I was hoping for a little more in this version of the movie aside from just gorgeous sound and impeccable visuals. Instead, Last Action Hero on Blu-ray features Movie IQ, which allows for semi-annoying (if you haven't seen the movie a few times before) pop-ups that give interesting information about the film, and Blu Live, which seems to be a common feature among all Blu-ray movies meant to direct viewers to Sony's online store. There's no deleted scenes or outtakes (my personal favorite extras) or even interviews with cast and/or crew. While I understand that since this an older movie and keeping up with extra features was very different then, you would think that they could have come up with something.<br /><br />It's difficult to say whether or not the Blu-ray edition of Last Action Hero is worth it, especially with the serious lack of bonus features and the relatively high price tag associated with Blu-ray disks. If you are looking for flawless video and audio quality, then the Blu-ray is the perfect choice, but if you're looking for new material, then save your money and check out the DVD (or even VHS) version of the movie.
B001U887QK|5.0|Got them for my husband as house shoes. He hardly ever takes them off... almost in a weird way. Some people say to go up a size because of the lining, but my husband and brother in law (he has some as well) both say that was not necessary. If you take the lining out to wash it you will notice that the shoe is actually larger than normal to compensate for the lining.
B002A4Q652|3.0|I first heard about Dutch symphonic metal band Delain through both Facebook and Amazon. I was constantly being bombarded by Facebook ads about the band since I belong to symphonic metal fan groups and have added several band fan pages. On Amazon, whenever I would check out my recommendations, Delain's April Rain was, 9 times out of 10, the top suggestion. I resisted for several months, citing the fact that I didn't know anything about the band, the general lack of information about them online and the fact that they were always advertised as the band from the \\"former keyboardist of Within Temptation.\\" While I'm a big WT fan, it seems like singer Sharon den Adel and her partner and guitarist Robert Westerholt are the driving creative talent behind WT, so what could I expect from the \\"former keyboardist\\"?    I finally decided to do some research on Delain, and found that the WT former keyboardist is actually Robert's brother Martijin, who had left the band due to a chronic illness in 2001. After meeting then-relatively-unknown singer Charlotte Wessels, the pair formed Delain. Originally begun as a studio project, Delain's first album, Lucidity (which I haven't heard) was filled with guest appearances (notably by Sharon den Adel, Marco Hietala of Nghtwish and Liv Kristine of Leaves' Eyes). After success, Martijin and Charlotte decided to add band members, step out and become a touring band. That was the goal with April Rain -to help Delain become most established as a unique band rather than just a project.    At first listen, April Rain is barely a symphonic metal album, in fact, I would call in more of a rock album with some heavier moments, a lighter, more \\"pop\\" type feel and a few symphonic elements. Probably the best way to think of it is to consider April Rain as \\"Within Temptation light.\\" It's not as heavy, intense, or emotional as most bands in the symphonic metal genre and tends to go more toward the \\"commercial,\\" which many fans of the genre won't be too happy about.    For me, Delain's April Rain was a mixed bag. There were good and bad things. First, it's hard to really stand out in a genre that's saturated with so many established, talented bands and, as much as newer acts may hate it, they will always be compared to older bands, particularly Nightwish and, in the case of Delain, Within Temptation. Compared to these two bands, which are genre favorites for me, Delain's April Rain is very average. The music is good, and even has some flashes of awesome, but doesn't have the raw emotion or intensity that these other bands can evoke with virtually every song.    The biggest problem I had with this album was that it just felt overproduced, particularly with Charlotte's vocals. It felt like I couldn't hear or understand her for about 80% of the CD because of the mixing and production. When I actually did get to hear her voice, particularly on \\"On the Other Side,\\" it was gorgeous. Sure, it's not a classically-trained opera voice, but it's still pure and amazing -I just wish that I got to hear more of that than production. Several songs also felt like they were just a little too overdone -kind of like the band had so many ideas, but weren't able to effectively edit them down for each song so some songs became just too much. If they would have taken out some of these ideas and broken them up, I'm sure there would have been potential for even more music -that could even be better!    Also note that there is a guest appearance by Marco Hietala of Nightwish (on \\"Control the Storm\\" and \\"Nothing Left\\"). Marco's vocals, as intriguing as always, don't seem to add much while Delain guitarist Ronald Landa's growls take the album to a completely different place (\\"Virtue and Vice\\") and just doesn't fit at all (his clean vocal on \\"Invidia\\" is better). I could honestly have done without any the male vocal work and just stuck with Charlotte. If Delain wants a duet with a male vocalist, maybe they should consider Mario Plank from Visions of Atlantis or Keith Caputo who sung with Sharon den Adel on \\"What Have You Done Now?\\" -I think they would fit the musical type (and work with Charlotte) better.    There are a few high points here, and I can't ignore those. Title song \\"April Rain\\" is incredibly fun and catchy -it kept getting stuck in my head and I would have a great time singing to it on the way to work. I really found a way to invest in this song, particularly the music itself, though it is a bit unoriginal, light and \\"commercial\\" (which would turn off many hardcore metal fans, but hey, I have to admit I like this song). Also, \\"On the Other Side\\" shows off Charlotte's vocals the best in its raw form. I loved the sound of her voice over all the strings, which made up the \\"core\\" of the song, and I finally felt like the band found a way for Charlotte to really engage with the symphonic aspect of the music. Of course, it would bother some that this has a more \\"pop\\" type sound, particularly around the chorus, but the rest of the song makes up for it in my mind. \\"Lost\\" is the last highlight. The song starts out with a pulse-pounding metal opening before leading into a lighter melody that carries Charlotte through the song. Again, I like this song because I can hear Charlotte more, I love the piano work, and I really thought \\"Lost\\" did the best job of keeping all the elements together without becoming a big mess.    April Rain is good for when I'm in a little bit lighter mood, but tends to be average for the most part. I've listened to this album several times now in an attempt to give Delain more chances (I really wanted to like it more). Maybe it would grow on me, like Visions of Atlantis' Trinity album. Heck, it even took a few listens before I became a Nightwish fan! But alas, I couldn't quite get to that magical place with Delain's April Rain. After a week of trying, when I put in the CD I listen to \\"April Rain\\" and sometimes flip to \\"The Other Side\\" and \\"Lost,\\" but don't always get through them before I want to switch CDs. I really think that Delain could become better with future albums -I'm excited to see where they go -but they aren't quite there yet.

B001BTG3OQ|2.0|This Flash was meant to be used by professionals and is suppose to substitute the older version SB-800. I use it a few times in a baby birthday party and it get heat very easy. Then you have to wait 10 minutes without use it. I tried to slow my shots to avoid this. A friend of mine told me: you cannot shoot pointing the head of the flash up, because that causes the heat faster, you cannot use the diffuser because it will heat faster, you cannot shoot all power because it will heat faster. So if you're a professional you want to be creative and do your work without being restricted by your tools.<br /><br />I prefer to get the SB-600 and improve my camera to D3S to shoot higher ISO, and improve the lenses to F2.8 and VR to avoid using a lot of power or buy the SB-900 and deactivate the temperature system.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|Moviemakers  of 2009 teased us with their trailers for December releases throughout the latter part of the year. I looked forward to both Sherlock Holmes and Avatar. I bought the Sherlock Holmes soundtrack before seeing the movie, but I had the chance to listen to it first for a week on AOL First Listen. After the week was up and the CD was replaced by others, I was frustrated by the wait for the store release. The soundtrack was so good that I couldn't wait to get a copy.    I've now listened to this music in the context of viewing the movie and also multiple times at home. It's by far one of the most interesting and memorable soundtracks I've heard. Other reviewers with more musical knowledge than I have picked apart the music, describing the instruments and techniques. All I know is that it perfectly fits the movie. However, whether or not you see the movie, it is a unique interpretation--modern, disjointed, teasing, foreboding, edgy, jarring, exploding--rather like a piece of abstract art, and I find myself constantly drawn back to it. There are quirky old-fashioned sounds as well, such as gypsy violins and banjos, and you can almost hear a steam engine huffing down the track, increasing to breakneck speed, much like the movie's time period when mechanization was about to change the world.     My favorite theme is within the final 18-minute Psychological Recovery ... 6 Months. Zimmer takes the memorable sound of the Westminster chimes of Big Ben and our grandfather clocks and incorporates it into an exciting piece of music.    I hope the buzz for Avatar doesn't knock Sherlock Holmes out of an Oscar win for best movie soundtrack. I purchased the Avatar soundtrack before seeing the movie also. It pales in comparison to the excitement of the Sherlock Holmes soundtrack. Whether or not you enjoyed the movie, buy this music. It's a winner.

B002OB9KPE|5.0|I had been told that this was one of the best progressive bands in recent years, but somehow i hadn't listened to them.   I'm  a big fan of Mike Portnoy and Neal Morse, and also love Roine Stolts voice.    I was particularly familiar with Trewabas.      Still, i hadn't listened to them.   I heard of the new album, and read all about it, so i decided to buy it.   What a great choice.   To say i was impressed may be little.   I bought all their albums afterwards, The whirlwind is as good as the other two, no better, no worse, it's just a different kind of album, more of a concept type.    It's songs are on the short end, so they are always listenable  by themselves.   Out of the night, Set us Free and Evermore might be the highlights of the album.  My only complaint is the closing song which seems to drag for a little too long, i'm ok with the religious lyrics, Morse will always put them in from now on, but i think it's by far the worst song in the album.   Everything else is awesome.   Make yourself a favor and get the special edition.   Its worth it, for the art and the extra cd.

0393317552|3.0|I was searching for a world history book that would condense the most significant events into one volume. A friend happened to recommend this book so I bought it. Although I've only read one third of the book, it seems to me a little dense and scientific. It does not read as a novel but rather as a scientific approach towards civilization. For an avid history major this may seem like the right book; however, for someone looking for a brush up on world history from a broad perspective, this book would seem technical and even boring at some points. There's also the constant referral to New Guinea in almost every significant aspect of the book; no doubt attributable to the field work performed by Diamond on this particular place. It seems however that it obscures the objectivity of world history by his specific findings and subjective conclusions. However being only a beginner in terms of world history knowledge, I would leave it up to historians to debate this last point. Loaded with data and scientific conclusions on very specific areas; low on generalized high view cornerstones of history...
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I found this movie to be very interesting and a definite eye-opener. I think everyone who has the opportunity, should watch it. I didn't think it was biased at all.

B001FB55HQ|2.0|This DVD is heavy on the special effects and light on the plot. Having seen all of the terminator movies, there has been a downward spiral since \\"The Governator\\" left the scene. Given the economic state of California, who knows, maybe he will \\"be back\\" as promised. On the other hand, Terminator the TV Series is excellent. Much better than the movies. The scripts are written very well with a great deal of novel ideas worked into the plot that are technologically sound. For example, the notion that sophisticated traffic management systems could be the precursor to the terminator's nervous system was an inspired parallel.[[ASIN:B001AQO43M Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles - The Complete Second Season]][[ASIN:B001AQR3J4 Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles - The Complete Second Season [Blu-ray]]] The writers of the TV series have clearly done their homework as well as providing creative plot lines that hold the viewer's attention any loyalty. The movie scripts are, for the most part hack jobs with Terminator Salvation serving as an arch-typical illustration. The whizzbang is fine, but there needs to be a bit more substance behind the plot.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is an outstanding set!  I watch them with my kids and can't believe how they got the footage for this stuff.  A must have in your blu ray collection!
B0001GL3K4|2.0|Even though the story in this movie has merit, I think the portrayal of some of the scenes was inappropriate.  The sexual portions and foul language were not enjoyable.  I was told this was a great movie and it could have been one of those you want to watch often.  I guess I didn't notice that it was an R movie, but if it wasn't it should have been. The purchase and ordering experience at Amazon were great.
B001KMB6VE|1.0|My intent on ordering this movie was the attraction to the \\"stunning visuals\\"...well, with my spectacular HD, didn't really see any of the above.  What was seeable was the typical \\"bully\\" style \\"acting\\" from Diesel and some strange woman floating around for whatever reason. This is what would be recommended to watch as you are being put into a coma. It definitely would prepare you for what is ahead.

0061765236|5.0|I've never written a review before, but feel compelled to add my praises for The Pact.  It is one of the best books I've ever read -- a very gripping story, inhabited with true-to-life characters.  Save this book for a long weekend or an upcoming vacation, because you won't want to put it down.
1400052173|5.0|Rebecca Skloot has written a nonfiction book that traces the history of cell research and medical ethics over the last half-century, through the story of one African-American family, the Lacks.   The science history in this book is compelling in itself, recounting how cellular theory has penetrated every corner human biological and disease research, including cancer research, the development of vaccines, the mapping of the human genome and organ transplants.   Yet the heart of the story is the ethical and moral one; and, in this case, that story is uniquely American.    Henrietta Lacks was an African-American woman, descended from slaves and slave-owners, who died at age 31 of cervical cancer, leaving behind a husband and several young children, as well as dozens of cousins, aunts, and uncles.  Before she died, and without her consent, cells from her cancerous cervix were cut and cultured. These cells -- which were labeled \\"HeLa,\\" using the first two letters of Mrs. Lacks' first and last name -- turned out to be, not merely the first cells that reproduced in a petri dish, but also wildly prolific; indeed, the most prolific cells in the universe of cells that were later cultured.  HeLa cells have traveled literally everywhere, including in outer space, and have been the basis of virtually all of the research described above.  (Even unintentionally: part of the story is how \\"HeLa\\" cells were so potent that they contaminated other cell lines.)    Yet Henrietta and her family knew nothing of this for over two decades.  Moreover, even after learning that their mother's cells were \\"immortal\\", the Lacks family was deceived and exploited by the scientists who had taken those cells without Henrietta's knowledge and consent.  Skloot has written a book that describes, not merely the history of medical science and ethics over the past half-century, but also the continuing saga of Africans in America, as they moved from the plantation fields, to the cities, to 21st Century society.  One point made in the story is the continuing bonds and traditions of such African-American families, whose oral histories go back to the slave period, and whose family attachments have survived even the worst insults of white society.    All this is told in a compelling, first person narrative that details the attempts of Skloot to persuade the Lacks, who had been lied to so many times, to trust and confide in her.  Clearly, writing this book was both a passion and learning experience for Skloot, and she conveys both these elements to the reader.  Indeed, the troubled history and current state of relations between whites and blacks in America, as exemplified in Skloot's relationships with the Lacks, and particularly Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, is yet another layer in this complex, multi-layered, fascinating book.    The National Book Award and a Pulitzer may be on the way for Rebecca Skloot; but the sooner that this book is on the way to your mailbox or Kindle, the more fortunate you may count yourself.
B00000F99X|2.0|Was not very helpful wrt cruising information for the area, rather amateurish, poor video quality, better than nothing but only just!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Sometimes, sitting in the Antipodes, one wonders if the only history is American history; such is the power of the media and American control thereof. Even as a child in the U.K. in the fities, Davey Crockett was nudging Robin Hood as my all-time hero.    Having said that, the docu-drama, John Adams rises above such arguments simply because it is so good. It has a strong sense of time and place and Paul Giamatti  impresses in his absolutely convincing portrayal of a fascinating and complex man, a man of great intellectual and moral strength, yet sometimes touchingly vulnerable. (Not only that, but, given that the series spans much of Adams' adult life, it took more than make up to convince us that Giamatti was playing a ninety-two year old in the final episode. A rare tour de force.)    If one accepts, as one must, that every movie can only be a version of reality -and something of a guess - when dealing with historical characters, it was no less of a delight to watch Laura Linney's portrayal of Abigail Adams.     This was a woman who was stalwart and wise in support of her husband and his beliefs, nursed his fragile ego at times, raised a large family, kept the family farm going almost single handedly, and acted as consort when John was engaged at the highest levels of internationl diplomacy. Should the series have been called Abigail Adams?    As an outsider looking in on American history, I was pleasantly surprised to see that little gloss was applied to the issues. All the birthing pains of the new nation were there: the disagreements, the suspicion, the competing egos, the misjudgements and miscalculations. Thee scene where Adams castigates the artist who painted an historically inaccurate of the signing of the Declaration of Independence is particularly telling; Adams is adamant that it is a travesty because those depicted rarely met together, and certainly not on this occasion.     Perhaps this is something of a metaphor for the whole series?    This is the man John adams \\"warts and all\\", from small-town lawyer to president and yet very human; sometimes touchingly so.    Thorougly enjoyable, even for this mildly cynical viewer!
B000784WMW|5.0|When considering which presentation of Jane Eyre to purchase, I read through numerous reviews of all available.  This adaptation appeared to be the most praised, and I now know why.<br /><br />Timothy Dalton - gorgeous and perfect as Mr. Rochester.  Can't imagine any other actor in that part.  I fell for him myself.  I like that they included the gypsy scene as it shows he truly had affection for Jane to play such a practical joke on her, which would seem almost out of character for him.<br /><br />The subtlety with which Zela Clarke played Jane showed the grace, softness and self-control that was at the heart of Jane.  It was easy to see why someone who appeared as tough as Mr. Rochester would fall for her and want to protect her.<br /><br />I have not seen any of the other versions of Jane Eyre, and quite honestly have no desire to.  I'm completely satisfied with this one, and you will be too.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|Maybe it is the fact that I am now 38 with short hair, responsibilities and a family. Could it be my longing for the days of rippin it up in the mosh pit...I loved those days...when you hear the baseline of Would before the band appears on the stage. This album is a very good album, but it does not give the adrenal charge that Dirt did, the tranquility that Jar of Flies did. But with that said, hasn't AIC matured as well? Time has tosses us obstacles to overcome to make us who we are today. Guess the strong familiarity of the sound is there but made for the now. I miss Layne...tragic life..great artist. Recommend the album, it is a good piece of work and I hope it leads to more albums. AIC is the band that has influenced me the most, they are who they are. It is nice to be reconnected with new material.. like reconnecting with an old friend.
B001RT89TC|5.0|Truly one of my favorite albums.  Schenker COOKS on this one . . . tasty guitar, great melodies, awesome rhythm section.  Schenker plays a lot on this album, but he never seems to \\"overplay.\\"  Unlike so many other guitar players, every lead is fresh and different.  Truly tasteful.  Lyrically, Assault Attack is a little silly at times . . . but the singing is so cool, I honestly don't pay much attention to what Graham Bonnet says (!!).  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM . . . .
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer (Blue Album) being Weezer's debut album and 1994 release and was a massive hit among the critics and a top ten hit in Switzerland and New Zealand. The best three tracks are \\"Undone - the sweater song\\", \\"Buddy Holly\\" and \\"Say it aint so\\". Allmusic and Rolling Stone both the album favourable reviews. The sound of this debut album is a mix of alternative rock and power pop. 5/5.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Love this movie!  I saw it in the theatre and bought it when it came out on DVD.  My son wanted it for Christmas but he had already bought it on blu-ray so I kept it.  It is really great on blu-ray.  The color and sound are sharper and clearer.  This is really several stories which connect each other by the theme of love.  We watch it every Christmas but this would make a very good Valentine's movie.  The acting is superb!  The stories are very believable and the music is catchy.  Now when I hear \\"God Only Knows\\" by the Beach Boys I think of the ending of this movie.  A great date movie!
B0019X3ZZY|4.0|This is a great movie to sit down with friends and watch how they react to the things said and done in this movie. I gave it only 4 stars cause it's more talk than action, and so half the movie is not so interesting as it could have been.    It was kind of hard to read the English Subtitles, cause they talk to fast, so had to constantly put the film in slow motion or pause and replay most of the film as I watched it.    If you like films like \\"Blood Sucking Freaks\\" then this is a film you'll want to see.

0316017922|1.0|Outliers, like the rest of Gladwell's books, reels you in with its sensationalist themes, and claims of deep insight into the human or its society. But after lightly reading this large-print, thirty-dollar compilation of \\"studies\\", opinions, and idealistic suggestions offered by Gladwell, I felt a sense of emptiness--the same sort of emptiness felt after completing an hour of reality television.  This book offers nothing new to the table (except for maybe renewed sense of demotivation).  Worst of all, the essence of this book demonizes intellect, upholds mediocrity, and offers the layman an excuse to revert to a bastardized sort of mentality common in pre-Enlightenment Europe, where success was a foreign term and self-improvement was a term used only in the context of muscle-building.
B001TD1XWG|3.0|Well, here it is at last, Lil Wayne's oft delayed Rock album and his vanity project. So, is it any good? Well, for those open to new stuff, it's not so bad. Some songs stand out; the buzzing \\"Ground Zero\\", the dance-y \\"Da Da Da\\", the more mellow \\"Paradice\\", the bouncy Pop-tinged \\"Get A Life\\", the slower chugging \\"Runnin'\\" featuring Shanell (who really should have done all the singing), \\"One Way Trip\\" featuring Kevin Rudolf), and the more Hip Hop-than-Rock \\"Drop The World\\" featuring Eminem.<br /><br />Now, to the bad; much of the music brings nothing new to the table, hardly any special guitar licks for one. \\"On Fire\\" for example stands out thanks to the juxtaposition of a very eighties-sounding intro and intermittent riff (which reminds me somewhat of Cyndi Lauper's \\"She Bop\\" and Irene Cara's \\"Fame\\") over skittery beats, he should have experimented more like this. Also, his growl/snarling vocals grate on one's ears after a while. Lastly, the lyrics are for the most part juvenile.<br /><br />Definitely not as bad as most make it out to be, it's obviously something Wayne needed to get out of his system. Most artists have an experimental album in their repertoire that people didn't get (Kanye, Prince, Terence Trent D'arby, Erykah Badu, for example) and while this is nowhere near as arty or accomplished as those efforts by the above artists, this appears to be Lil Wayne's attempt.

B002SJIO4A|1.0|This is without exception the absolute worst movie it has ever been my misfortune to see.  I am extremely frustrated that the perpetrators of this blight on the entertainment world have so skillfully used small exerpts in their advertising to make this appear to be an actual movie which was capable of providing some form of entertainment to it's viewers.  One would expect that with such skills, they would have been capable of creating something worth watching.  I would wholeheartedly recommend NOT to waste any time or money to see this piece of rubbish.

He is really an exciting and talented young man. I highly recomment this CD of David Garrett.
1591843162|5.0|Seth Godin's Linchpin  takes a look at the artist inside of all of us.  Nothing short of sparking a revolution in the way we think about our daily lives and work - Godin challenges the reader to become indispensable by engaging our work with passion instead of becoming the dull, monotonous \\"cogs\\" in a corporate nightmare.<br /><br />I'll be completely transparent here: I love Seth Godin's writing/speaking/blog/etc.  You may or may not be a fan, but in my view every person who's ever had a dream and not taken the next step (dream to shipping as Godin would say) then you need to run and get this book now.  It's a quick read at just under 250 pages and it might just alter your success trajectory for life.<br /><br />Painting our current grim corporate situation akin to Orwell's dystopian society in \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\", Godin casts a vision for a world where people are paid to do what they are passionate about instead of what they've been trained to do or what they think will generate the most cash for them.<br /><br />I felt that Godin's perspective was a compromise of Pollan and Levine's \\"Die Broke\\" from several years ago.  Pollan and Levine proposed that your job was just a cash-generator, you need not associate yourself or self worth with what you do.  Rather jump to the job that pays the most and has the best benefits.  Once you've found something better jump, because who you are has little to do with what you do for a living.<br /><br />Godin, I think, would rather encourage his tribe to jump to something they feel like they are passionate about.  He does however make the point that we can find purpose and meaning in our current job - often it is more about our perspective.  He strongly encourages the reader to not think of their skills as who they are, because skills can easily be replaced with someone with the same or better skills.<br /><br />Rather, to become indispensable one must be willing to work within a broken system, not be content with the present, but remain optimistic about the future.  Godin tells the reader \\"we\\" (meaning all of society) need artists, independent thinkers, and people that realize our primary ability to connect with others is the paramount virtue.  Our society has taken the process or system and removed the humanity in an order to provide consistent, cheap, and automated solutions.<br /><br />In Godin's mind this is the antithesis of progress.  The artist creates, gives his gifts away, and goes back to the drawing board to create once again.  Sometimes this may be profitable, other times it may be done at a loss, but the end result is art given freely.<br /><br />Reminds me of another good book by my favorite author, \\"Freely you have received, freely give.\\"Godin tells the reader \\"we\\" (meaning all of society) need artists, independent thinkers, and people that realize our primary ability to connect with others is the paramount virtue.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|As a frequent watcher of nature programs over the last 30 years, I have to say that this is one of the all time greats.  Attenborough docs are always solid and there's no shortage of the usual charm, but the filming techniques have really come to the fore on this effort.  There are utterly spectacular moments in each of the episodes.  Yes, the overview episode is redundant, but there's very little else to be critical about.  One for the ages, this.

No pictures of more of \\"The Prince OF Darkness's\\" bandmates like my guitar hero Zakk Wylde; like Mr. Wylde cares, but if Motley Crue gets in the pictorial section so should some of his later band members... but besides that I HIGHLY recommend this read to anybody!
B00280LYIC|1.0|This was an excellent novel. I highly suggest you read an adaption of The odyssey by Homer prior this story. The book is much more understandable afterwards. All in all Ithis book was very enjoyable and I look forward to reading the next.
B0015DWJX2|3.0|Considering all the hype and excellent reviews this book has been getting, I expected it to floor me. While I can't say I was disappointed in the book, it certainly didn't send me into a delirious tizzy. The structure of the book - letters between several people - was a delightful surprise, and an excellent tool in developing the various (and varied) characters. The setting of just-post-WWII England & Guernsey was a fantastic choice, and I truly enjoyed learning about Guernsey's occupation during the war, sad as it was. But in the end, this post-war, historic novel ended up being a simple romance in the vein of Pride & Prejudice. The formatting for Kindle was very good, with just a few spelling errors, etc. Overall, I would recommend this book, but don't expect it to change your life.<br /><br />If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!
B001C4CI8U|4.0|Fringe has become one of my absolute favourites on television, no doubt about it. Like many I was very skeptical at first, and found myself feeling very icy towards Anna Torv, but John Noble warmed me back up every time he graced the screen. Unfortunately, it takes time to build up, and once it does it's impossible to catch up if you don't watch it consecutively. I've tried to get some friends to watch it, and all of them have said more or less the same: \\"I can see the appeal, but I don't have the time to get into it at the moment.\\" Which makes sense, even for me (who has followed Fringe since its pilot run) seeing as there are tons of subplots running underneath everything else and it can get confusing - much like Abram's other effort, Lost. Nevertheless, this is \\"the\\" show that I watch with my mom every Thursday night, so when I bought the box set she was eccstatic!<br /><br />As for the DVD set itself, I have really enjoyed all of the special features so far and the layout is very eye-catching - not to mention the price is just fantastic. Buy it now while you still have the chance! What a steal!
B00166996S|5.0|I'm here in attempt to cancel the vote from the buyer who had the problem with this being a live album...hmmmm.    This album is fantastic. The live setting really showcases the musical talents of the group especially Matthew Bellamy (guitar, singer, etc.) I agree with the reviewer who suggested purchasing the DVD/CD combo to watch the group perform. They put on an amazing show and due to their rare US tours, this is the best bet for most of us. Even if you don't buy the DVD, the music is great for a workout or run - great pace and energy throughout.    I highly recommend it!
1416914285|1.0|I picked up this book because I am a fan of Holly Black's works. They may not be the most awe-inspiring books in the world, but they're quirky, fun, and entertaining. I was hoping for the same here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, City of Bones read like an unsavory joke and left a bad taste in my mouth. I must confess, I did not read the entire thing - I skimmed through much of it in hopes that the ridiculousness would wear off and it would redeem itself. Maybe even make me laugh.<br /><br />It didn't.<br /><br />I could not take any of it seriously, most of all the main character herself. There was much telling involved in this book, and no showing - the number one fiction rule that one must not break. I felt like the first-person narrative was only used to shove the narrator into my face and make me like her, when in reality I felt nothing toward her - not even hate. That's a very, very bad sign.<br /><br />I can only hope Cassandra Claire will learn from her mistakes this time around and write something original one day. On the bright side, its these sort of books that give me hope of being published one day.

B00006WKSZ|4.0|Not being familiar with the Scorpions 70's output (or the guitar playing of Uli Jon Roth), the Tokyo Tapes is a great introduction to both.  The catchiness of the 80's Scorpions material is audible in this material, but with a more classic hard rock sensibiity.  Fave tunes include Pictured Life, In Trance and We'll Burn The Sky.  I would liken this record to Priest's Unleashed in the East, in that both records are a great compilation of earlier material (and are of course live records recorded in Tokyo!).
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Everyone should watch this documentary.  It's enlightening and will change the way you eat.  I saw it in the theater and purchased two to give away.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|When I saw the trailer for this movie, (theatrical cut) I had not idea as to what \\"Watchmen\\" was. I asked my friend, he said, go read the book. So instead, I bought the \\"Watchmen Complete Motion Comics\\" (I'll shortly have a review for that as well.) Anyway, then I got the theatrical cut from Netflix and thought it was frickin' amazing. So then I watched it about 10 more times and found out, wow, there's a version coming out with Tales of the Black Freighter in the move. So I waited out 5 months. I watched it in one sitting.<br /><br />The action is superb, espeically the first sequence with the Comedian, (Jeffery Dean Morgan), and then you're introed to Rorshach, (Jackie Earl Haley, the best actor in the whole movie.), You then get Nite Owl, (Patrick Wilson), and the other motley crew of superheroes, Dr. Manhattan, Veit, Silk Spector. The movie itself is a little hard to swallow in one sitting, I suggest breaking it up in to sets that you can bear, like working out. But on your couch, and probably with some popcorn and your eyes glued to your extremly big TV.<br /><br />The packaging is interesting, having the pirate thing instead of the smiley face or the Doomsday Clock. When you open it, the cover is magnetic, then there's a pocket holding the discs in all thier glory. You get a foldable case for the movie itself, which contains the Ultimate Cut, second disc with tons of extras, and disc three, the digital copy. Next, individually seperate from the Ultimate Cut discs are the motion comics. Which are amazing as well. The narrator isn't so good at the female characters, but beggars can't be choosers. If you like \\"Watchmen\\" the movie or the graphic novel, I highly highly reccomend this set because it has everything they released previously, basically, they just want your money, Klyngon bastards. Still a good box set, PICK UP IMMEDIATLEY!!!!

B0030IIYWA|5.0|This is the first in the \\"Toy Story\\" franchise (1995) and the first film animated solely by computer. It establishes a family of toys owned by a boy named Andy who plays rough with his toys and writes his name on his favorites. This is really an action flick with toys rather than people being the superheroes engaged in intrepid rescues.<br />The toys fear birthdays and Christmases because Andy may get a new toy as a present; this new one may win him over, and some of his older ones may end up in a dumpster or out at a yard sale.<br /> The leader of the toy family is Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy puppet who plays some electric sounds if a wire in his back is pulled. Of course these toys can talk. The sequel to this movie was very good in filling in the back stories of the toys (Woody was a spin-off toy from a popular old TV series), and it individualized them. Bo Beep with her little crook in this one seems to have a crush on Woody.<br /> On his birthday Andy gets a new toy, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), whom he prefers to Woody at first. Buzz thinks he's a real spaceman which makes him take crazy risks. Buzz and Woody have to save toys from the nasty, sadistic next-door kid named Sid and his vicious dog. Sid turns toys into mindless mutants. Sid really is an evil piece of work.<br /> People are the bad guys. Andy, a typical kid, is fickle about his toys. People are also dangerous for the toys because they are unpredictable.<br />This is a real kid's movie without any adult-aimed gags. When viewed with the second in the series, it provides some fun viewing because there's so much growth in \\"Toy Story 2.\\"
B0026P3G12|3.0|I never received this item, I kept tracking it and it showed it was delivered Jan 7th to my door, at 7:0 P.M.  it was never there, we were having a snow storm at that time, so it probably got blowed away.Since I never got it, I'm going to have to purchse it at a store.  I purchased it through AMazon.
B00020HEL6|1.0|As an avid collector of Music I try to listen to many different types and genres.  In my exploration a friend brought in his Renee Olstead CD's because she was one of his favorites.  I diplomatically asked him to kindly play Ms. Olstead in the privacy of his own home because her amazing lack of vocal control was tantamount to torture.    I'm not kidding, this album should be against the Geneva convention.  Olstead has the POTENTIAL for a great voice with training and time but instead she learned some quick technical tricks from her mentor and tried to sell it.  If you aren't trained musically she pulls it off but I cannot see any serious musician actually liking her cobbled together singing.  I'm actually offended at how bad this album is.    My friend and I came to an agreement, he never plays Renee Olstead around me, and I don't play Tom Waits around him.  I apologize to Tom for mentioning his name anywhere near Olstead's.
0786868724|5.0|In the same like of Mitch Albom's books this one is no different. Thought provoking, intelligent, and soulful. Whether you have a faith or are searching for one, this book is capable of entertaining you either way.
B0017XCDN6|4.0|This movie is good and you even hold sympathy for the Japenese at times. Its well acted and gets you into the world war 2 theme (pacific theater). The only problem is the subtitles. The subtitles are small and you pay more attention at the subtitles than the actual movie. I know it's in Japenese and that the only way to understand the movie but they should of put the subtitles a bit bigger. Other than that this movie is great.
0316044695|3.0|This book is a sort of double edged sword for me. You really root for the Navy SEAL's out there in the back lines of Afghanistan, but at the same time, you get distracted by the author's political view on liberals, politicians, and so forth. I just wish he could have stuck to the story about how they fought to the death, Alamo style. In that respect, it truly is a heroic story. And these guys are brave, no doubt about it, but when you read a book that has an author that despises liberals as much as the Taliban, it's a bit hard to swallow. The funny thing is that I'm not even a liberal, but it was even hard for me to take. Just the facts Ma'am, alright?    By the way, a much better book on this subject is 'BravoTwoZero' by Andy McNab. He's a British elite SAS member stuck behind enemy lines with four others in Iraq. Sound familiar? It is, but more than anything, it concentrates on the battle at hand, not the political battle at home.
0385504225|3.0|I'm probably being overly generous giving this book three stars, but it did hold my attention and taught me a few things, and any book that can do that is not completely devoid of merit.  That said, this is easily Dan Brown's weakest effort (and yes, I'm including Deception Point and Digital Fortress here).  There are a number of problems.  First and foremost, the 'mystery' just isn't that interesting.  Nor are the clues that are gradually discovered and unlocked.  The Masons may make for an informative Wikipedia entry, but as a plot device, they just don't deliver.  I found all the intrigue and history and secrets rather ho-hum.  Brown hits on far more exciting stuff in his earlier Robert Langdon novels.  And speaking of R.L, the good professor is a problem here, too.  He is by turns a genius and an imbecile, whatever works to advance or detour the plot.  He suddenly remembers a lot of important details -- there are way too many Eureka moments that seem disingenuous.  Oh, and the villian -- aka problem number three.  Is his backstory -- unveiled at the end but seriously predictable right from the start -- really supposed to be a twist?  My dog could have figured that one out.  And she's been dead for 12 years.  I've got one last gripe, too.  While I don't think Brown's writing is as awful as others contend (it's not poetry, to be sure, but it (usually) doesn't make one cringe), he does have one annoying habit that ruins what could have been a few interesting twists.  As they say in poker, he has tells.  When a character is lying, or pretending to be someone else on the phone -- or when an event that is assumed to have happened in fact did not -- Brown words the action, or dialogue, in a way that raises red flags.  It's as if he wants to hint that something is not what it seems here, but isn't able to hint subtly enough.  There is no doubt that this book as a whole is a phoned-in effort.  But it's not the disaster some claim, and perhaps now that Brown has put DaVinci Code and the follow-up behind him, he can move on and create something that doesn't try quite so hard -- and delivers more.  That's something I'd look forward to reading.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The price of this is worth just the DVD feature about David McCullough so don't miss watching that.  The Extras also include 'the making of' which in this case is quite interesting.    The series itself is fantastic.  More linear than the book, it's an easy to follow richly done production with good acting.  Jefferson is underplayed, mercurial.  And the relationship between John and Abigail is a real inspiration and in my opinion very much like their letters.  It strays into some cul de sacs occasionally but the whole thing is a sweeping overview of an amazing time period in the history of our country.
B000JML90Y|5.0|If you have never read this book, you really should sit down and take the time to do do.  You will learn a lot of what Darwin was thinking during the years after the Beagle voyage, and perhaps more than you wanted to know about pigeons.    If you do NOT believe in evolution, you should read this book anyway.  If you have not than you have no basis to refute it, and can make only the most idiotic of arguments.  After all, just about everyone alive now who HAS read it, has read Genisis too.  Darwin did NOT invent evolution, it was around in his grandfather's time.  His grandfather actually wrote about it.  Darwin (and another actually) came up with natrual selection, not evolution.  If there was never a Charles Darwin, there would still be evolution.    The person who said (sic)  \\"evolution is not observable or testable and therefore not scientific. and by the way who are the favored races \\"  OBVIOUSLY didn't read this book, and is only making a religious statement.  And stupidly at that.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This movie was a surprise.  Most prequels do not do the series/prior movies justice.  I enjoyed it so much, I bought it and gave it as a gift.  Recipient was well pleased.
1400052173|5.0|Author Rebecca Skloot has created a masterpiece of nonfiction science writing with a narrative that will draw you in like a favorite novel.  Skloot explores the ethics of medical research in a very personal way, telling us the story of Henrietta Lacks, whose cancerous cells became the basis for research we've all benefited from. Ironically, as her daughter points out early in the book, the family received no compensation (and no consent) for this donation, and can't afford health care at the very institutions which have benefited from these cells.<br /><br />We learn more about Henrietta's family, her history, and her family's history in the rural South, picking tobacco.  Even though the rest of the world does not know about Henrietta's cells, they all do, and are proud of her contribution.<br /><br />I found this book difficult to put down - and highly educational (a rare combination!)<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|This was a gift for our daughter in law, she was ectatic when she saw the bottle shaped container which housed the DVDs. The product was exactly as described and arrived at our house a few days after it was ordered. She has been enjoying the series.

In a nutshell, you will thoroughly enjoy the outstanding cast (not to mention handsome Richard, gorgeous Mother Confessor & SEEKER's sexy bodyguard Modsith lady) , intriguing plots and awesome special effects.    Buy, watch & thoroughly enjoy each & every episode.  I'm positive that you will definitely be looking forward to buy 2nd season.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This is a very nice Nintendo manufactured controller. I've tried a few third party brand controllers and the overall quality and responsiveness just don't match the official Nintendo products. Yes it is more expensive but well worth the extra cash. This also has a nice long cord - probably twice the length of the original GAMECUBE controllers. I'm very pleased with this purchase.

B000Z7S5FU|3.0|They stil sound fine, a lovely blend of voices. Their harmonies are always pleasing. But alas, if you have the first album, don't bother with the new one. A few (a minority!) of the songs are new, but the new album is largley a rehash of the first album. It's a shame they haven't come up with enough new material. They divorced, since the first album, and that probably killed the \\"spark\\" that kindles creativity. If you love them, by the movie on DVD. It's already in the bargain bin.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I enjoyed watching this Miniseries.  HBO did a great job with this film.  I bought the product because of the pricing and wanted to see the miniseries

B00007LTIL|5.0|When I was a kid, my mom used to drag me with her to Grateful Dead concerts.  Seeing as how I didn't smoke pot yet, I was too young to appreciate the absolute magic that I was getting the honor to see.  Now that I'm almost 30 years old, I went back and listened to a couple of the older Dead studio albums, Workingman's Dead and this one American Beauty.  I simply couldn't stop listening to them once I started.  I'm talking as soon as I woke in the morning, one of these albums would go on, and after that, they'd be trading places in the CD player the rest of the day.  No albums has ever blown my mind to the extent that this one did.  The songs are simply all masterpieces and performed better than any of the other Dead's studio work.  I can't recommend this album enough to anyone.  One of the greatest musical masterpieces ever made.
B001FB55I0|4.0|I found this movie to be very good, especially since it finally brought the franchise out of the present day and into the future. Bale, Yelchin, and Worthington give excellent performances. The action and special effects are great. The added 3 minutes of footage give some extra cool touches to the film. Many complain that Skynet should have killed Reese immediately, but they forget that it has always been Skynet's goal to kill Connor, not Reese, and it is never stated that Skynet knows that Reese is Connor's father.
B000NVT0RU|5.0|If you like your war movies Hollywood-free you'll like this movie. It wasn't only the U.S. that defeated Germany and this movie tells the story of Algerian fighters who helped liberate France and bring down the Third Reich.

0393061310|4.0|Diamond looks at the development of humanity throughout history in a new way. His analysis of how mankind changed through technology and how certain countries easily conquered much larger ones is explained with several examples via a historical analysis. His look at farming and farm animal diseases and how these influenced human immunity explains the advantages certain conquerors had over others. Though much is theory, the ideas it promotes are very convincing.
B000V86OKG|5.0|I love this show. It was suggested that I check out the show and when I did I WAS HOOKED!! What I really like is that you really don't have to watch every season from the beginning to know what is going on. The little back stories maybe a little confusing if you don't start with season 1, but other than that you would be right in the loop. Fantastic show!!
B000000W3G|5.0|Very good album, it is amazing that they had so many b-sides on a double album.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I saw Leonard around 1963 when he appeared @ UCLA. I was lucky enough to meet Leonard because an assertive friend of mine managed to get us back stage. I was dumbstruck. Leonard gave me a piece of 'Sees' candy which I kept for years & even considered having it bronzed. Eventually I ate it. I was in my early twenties at the time.  I saw Leonard again in 2009 when he appeared in San Diego.  I had no assertive friend and I was 64.  So imagine how delighted I was when Leonard spoke of the last time he appeared on stage when he was at 60 still a young man with a crazy dream! I love having the album to re-experience the laughter and the wisdom that Leonard Cohen has gifted us with through the years. In my book [ASIN:0892540885 Night Wings: A Soulful Dreaming and  Writing Practice}. I look at the prophetic and the mundane message of dreams. Leonards'dream has carried him through a lifetime of creative expression.  Night Wings teaches us how to turn our dreams into creative expression.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I've been a trekie since the show first came on in the 60s when my brother and I were sure never to miss an episode.  The movies, of course, are fantastic, and the digitally remastered versions are of excellent quality.  I also enjoyed the Captain's Summit.  This set was half the price here at Amazon than it was at WalMart, so I was pretty happy to find it so I could put it in my wife's Christmas stocking.  Thanks, Amazon!
B002IR3PSC|3.0|I purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  Come to find out, the DVD only has pictures...it is NOT a concert.  If I would've known this, I wouldn't have purchased this item.  The CD is very good, but who would want to pay extra for a DVD that only shows 1 picture for each song and has the same songs as the CD?  Very disappointed.  If you are looking for a Jethro Tull concert, DO NOT buy this!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I can appreciate not only Susan Boyle's genuineness but the people who made an honest effort to bring out her best.  I can clearly see the quality of her voice that surpasses a lot of professionals.  The accompaniment and the title selections certainly bring out the quality of her voice and talent.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a great series that shows how terrible war is and how brave our second world war american heroes were. This series really hit home since my father-in-law was in the 101st Airborne and fought in the battles shown in the series. If I were a teacher this would be required viewing for my students. Our young people need to see what the WW II veterands did for us all.
B001FB55LC|1.0|In her review of \\"Brothers\\" Kathleen C. Fennessy writes, \\"Back in New Mexico, Grace and Tommy grow closer, stopping just short of a full-blown affair (in [Danish director] Susanne Bier's original [Danish movie \\"Brødre\\" starring Connie Nielsen], they take the plunge).\\"<br /><br />No they don't!  Just as in the American re-make, brother- and sister-in-law come close but they never actually have sex!  They both love their fallen brother and husband and would have betrayed the soldier's love, making them both unworthy of his sacrafice in Afghanistan!  (I'm sure that if the American version came first they would've slept together.)<br /><br />Ms. Fennessy should actually WATCH the movies she writes about on Amazon.com!

0446569895|5.0|I love this book.  I heard Sharon talking about it a week or so ago on TV and had to pick it up.  I haven't put it down until today, when I finished it.  I have never been a die-hard Ozzy fan, but I have always enjoyed his music and love to follow his life story.  It was very entertaining most of the time, sad in others (his drug/alcohol addiction and the loses he suffered), and very real.  It didn't sound sugar-coated at all.  I am a Texan and I can't get the image of Ozzy pissing on the Alamo out of my head....too funny.  I hope more people read it and get a better idea of what his real life is like.
B00004W510|5.0|Because it is the world's best band. Because it is the world's best bands best album. Because it is unrestrained and groovy and country and fonky and as rootsy as it can be. Because these five unearthly musical musicians / singers here sounded like they looked like: bearded, brown and as far from fluffy flower power as one can get. Because the concept of Americana can be summed up in this little brown album. Because The Bands \\"The Band\\" is earth, soil; organic, and probably the most genuine, cohesive albums I have ever heard. And it is absolutely impossible to tire of. Best album on earth. Period.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I am enjoying the music,after checking out the same cd,Amazon beat all prices. Will continue to purchase with Amazon

B001GCUO4S|3.0|I usually love the whole Final Destination series but I'd have to say it wasn't the best. I bought it to add to my collection and expected to be on the edge of my seat like with all the others. I do like the storyline as having it all start at the raceway but there seemed to be a lack of characters and the characters that were portrayed weren't the brightest in trying to survive.I don't know if it was because they really didn't care if they lived or died or if they just weren't smart enough to do their research on past similar events. I was a bit confused because the other 3 movies were related.Every part after part one mentions what happened in the part before and how it effects the new characters.I was also wondering what happened to the surviving cop and girl from part 2. Did they really survive death and break the chain when that kid died at the BBQ grill at the end?

1416562605|4.0|A highly anticipated book, The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga shows a maturity rarely found in new authors. His prospective is fresh and provides a vivid snapshot of India's lesser explored communities.<br /><br />Built around a man Balram with big dreams from a simple background, The White Tiger starts at the man's success as an entrepreneur. It draws on the readers' curiosity as to how this man came to be so successful given his challenges.  And before you know it, readers are thrown back into Balram's history which is filled with many twists and turns that only a miracle seems to have landed him into his current level of success.<br /><br />The odds against this common driver are sky high; however he overcomes the challenges by wit and chance. From overcoming the pre-determined caste profession track to the murder of his boss, Balram emerges victorious yet scarred by his tumultuous rise.<br /><br />Each turn is his life is written with such expertise that readers are transported into his shoes and left with uneasy feeling of Balram's predicament.  His ethics and principles wean depending on the situation which makes the character highly accessible.<br /><br />It's no doubt The White Tiger will deeply move readers and drive them towards Aravind Adiga's fresh writing style for many years to come. His work is brilliantly crafted.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|A pretty good rendition of the sixth book.  There were a few changes to the story line.  The beginning was a good example, Harry trying to score a waitress wasn't in the book. The movie, however, was still well done.  All in all it was enjoyable.  Disc II contained one of the best bonus features in the whole series.
B000YAA68W|4.0|PERSEPOLIS is an animated adaptation by Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud of Satrapi's critically acclaimed graphic novels which recount her upbringing in revolutionary-era Iran and difficult adaptation to Europe. The film combines both a historical presentation of Iran's tribulations with poignant observations of the immigrant experience.<br /><br />PERSEPOLIS has a few twists and turns like every Bildungsroman, but its course is fairly simple. As the film opens, we see the last days of the Shah's regime and the hope for a new, free country. The release of political prisoners bring Marjane's communist uncle Mantoush home, who tries to instill a desire for justice in his niece. After Khomeini turns the country into a theocratic regime and Iran is mired in a long, pointless war with Iraq, Marjane is sent to a boarding school in Vienna. Here she becomes ashamed of her background, has a constant series of feuds with landlords, and eventually ends up homeless. After she collapses in the cold and is taken to hospital, she decides to return to Iran. But now she finds that instead of the homeland she missed, the country had become even more hardline and corrupt. At the end of the film, Marjane arrives in France, determined to make it in Europe while staying true to herself.<br /><br />Though the tribulations of Satrapi's life were great, PERSEPOLIS is able to depict many things with humour. From Tehran's shady trenchcoat-clad sellers of forbidden music casettes to Marjane's ecstasy in a well-stocked European supermarket, there are a lot of laughs in the film. It sometimes feels a lightweight venture -- the presentation of Iran's history tends toward the didactic, while Marjane's experiences in Austria are never given as much depth as they might have been. Still, it's entertaining and often touching, and I'd recommend it.<br /><br />I saw this film in the original French, so I cannot comment on the voice acting in the English-language version.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|I ordered this DVD as a gift. I received it very fast. I am very pleased with my purchase. I will shop here again.
B001U887LU|5.0|I have seen these things called Crocs on many people, and did not understand how a pair of plastic shoes could be as comfortable as everyone said. Then I bought this pair, they feel like you are walking on air. The blitzen version that I purchased has a fleece liner that is removeable, this makes them versitile for winter or summer, or justlounging around the house. The value is also very good, 24 dollars for a pair of sandles you can wear all year long, is pretty unbeatable.  All in all I would recommend these Crocs to anyone.

142313494X|5.0|I am a big fan of books that include: action, history, science, & thrillers.  Even though I am 50 years old, I thought this was a very fun read.  You feel empathy for all the main characters. We can all relate to being picked on, in school, because we were \\"different\\".  Percy and his two friends make a wild trip cross country to save the world.  As the adventure continues, their friendship and loyalty grows.  This is a quick read, for an adult, but a very enjoyable one.  If you are a Harry Potter fan you'll enjoy this book.  I also have read the first three books in \\"The Immortal Nicholas Flamel\\" series and HIGHLY recommend them.
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|I purchased the vinyl version of \\"Time Out\\" in the sixties...classic stuff. The DVD of Brubeck talking about the ideas/influences behind the writing/arranging of the songs is excellent. I wanted it to be longer. Joe Morello was a big influence in my drumming style when I played as a teenager. It's all good stuff!
B002T9H2L0|1.0|First disc didn't work. When the replacement arrived and it also didn't work I googled the issue and found that the disc doesn't play in a wide variety of bluray models. How can you release something so poorly made not compatible with popular models? Yes, I did upgrade my firmware.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|2009 was another amazing year for heavy metal releases, as we all saw so many awesome new albums come out including ones form Kreator, Megadeth, Mastodon, Isis, Behemoth, Hatebreed, Lamb of God, Killswitch Engage, Dream Theater, Chimaira, Suffocation, Scar Symmetry, Five Finger Death Punch, and of course Slayer. Their latest release &#34;World Painted Blood&#34; is just simply amazing, and it's definitely one of the best metal CD's of 2009. It just thrashes and speeds through your stereo speakers like a beast from start to finish exactly the way a true thrash/speed metal album should do. I've been a huge fan of Slayer since I was 17, when I listened to both &#34;South of Heaven&#34; and &#34;Seasons in the Abyss&#34;. They are without question one of thrash metal's legendary and most popular bands, and when it comes to true and pure thrash metal, these guys got it down 100%. For &#34;World Painted Blood&#34;, the production is handled by Greg Fidelman, and it really gives the album a real killer raw and punishing edge which I love, and of course the band's musicianship is in absolute top form here. Tom Araya's screams never sounded more angrier, and he also throws in some actual singing parts especially on &#34;Beauty Through Order&#34; and &#34;Human Strain&#34;. Guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King both do an excellent job as always, lashing out lots of fast aggressive riffs and wild chaotic solos, and meanwhile Dave Lombardo keeps the energy and aggression going throughout with he's so well known for. He is simply one of metal's all time greatest drummers, no questions asked.<br /><br />Every song on this album is just excellent and diverse in each of it's own way. The opening title track is awesomely heavy and chugging ball-breaker that gets the energetic assault going on all cylinders, and following that are two ramming, speeding train wreckers &#34;Unit 731&#34; and &#34;Snuff&#34; (both songs are highlighted by onslaughts of fast hammering drums and violent energetic riffing and loud squealing solos). Track four and my favorite song &#34;Beauty Through Order&#34; slows things down a bit, but it features great build ups to some blistering thrash tempo changes especially near the end, meanwhile the fifth track &#34;Hate Worldwide&#34; is another awesome, thrashing assault that features more lightning fast riffs and leads, as well as more fast pounding and slamming drum work, and a great chorus to boot. Track eight &#34;Americon&#34; is another favorite on here that is highlighted by an infectious main riff, and a hefty, thumping, mid paced drum beat, and politically charged lyrics, while &#34;Psychopathy Red&#34; is another violent, thrashing, barn-burner that seriously delivers with a kick, and will have you headbanging endlessly throughout. &#34;Playing with Dolls&#34; is another awesome slow building cut that features a very strong vocal performance by Tom (and one of his best, may I add), and the lyrics are simply haunting and chilling, and of course the closing track &#34;Not of This God&#34; ends this thrashterpiece on a super strong note with more violent riffs and slamming drums that will leave you battered and bruised.<br /><br />&#34;World Painted Blood&#34; overall is a 100% pedal to the metal, thrashing, barn-burner of an album, and it's definitely right up there with classic Slayer albums such as &#34;Reign in Blood&#34;, &#34;Seasons in the Abyss&#34;, &#34;South of Heaven&#34;, and &#34;Hell Awaits&#34;. Slayer are truly a perfect example of true thrash metal done 100% correctly with no flaws whatsoever, and this new album is indeed proof. Bottom Line, this album is highly recommended to ANY fan of Slayer, so do yourself a good favor, and get this album as soon as possible, and spread a little hate worldwide, Slayer style!!!ic riffing and loud squealing solos).

1881273156|5.0|I read this book about 6 years ago and it really opened my eyes to the way relationships around me were working (or not, as the case may be.) It has really made a difference in the way I relate to people in all types of relationships. The concept is really quite facinating and I'd recommend it to anyone.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|A vivid depiction of ancient Rome during the time of Julius Ceasar,Brutus & Mark Anthony. Marvelous in depth study on the life & time of Rome. The character developement is superb. Some nudity & inappropriate language, except for adults. Costuming, set design superb. Kevin McKidd, Ray Stevenson's  acting  wonderful along with the rest of the ensemble. Anyone truly interested in ancient Rome would enjoy this. Very entertaining.
0061537969|4.0|Interesting book.  The narrator is the family dog.  He tells the story of the single man, meeting the girlfriend who becomes wife, the birth of the child, and all of the family events afterward.  The story really focuses on the family events.  The wife becomes ill.  The dog wants to be of help.  The title refers to the husband's race car driving.  There are lots of philosophical racing/life metaphors that I liked.  Sometimes the dog narrator is a bit affected.  However, I was surprised at how fluid it mostly was.  I didn't think too much about it for large parts of the text.  It was a loving perspective.

B002RSDW80|1.0|Saw the Blu-ray version from Netflix last night with my family.  I was probably giggling the most until I had to stop the disk and spend a few minutes explaining the Hollywood obsession with Senator McCarthy.  I did a little research and though Paul Child was sent back to Washington for an investigation, I found nothing that stated he was the subject of the investigation.  In fact, he came back to Washington and was promoted.  McCarthy was mentioned several times and there were a couple of republican jabs.  The worst was when Julie slept when she should have removed her dish from the oven and called in sick the next day so she could redo her dish.  She blogged about it and her bossed called her into his office because he read her blog.  He said, \\"Anyone else would fire you. A Republican would fire you!\\"<br /><br />Why? Why the unnecessary commentary.  It took us away from the plot (which is not exciting anyway).  When I first starting working, a coworker told me that I can rack up 25 attaboys but just one \\"Aw crap!\\" would wipe my slate clean.  This movie had several!
0385504209|5.0|This is a very good book haven't finished it yet. I would say so far 90% of the book is just like the movie. Still, I enjoy them both and was glad I saw the movie first. I do plan to get more of Dan Brown's books.
0517548232|5.0|Henry Hazlitt's one lesson is so simple, yet from the beginning the reader is able to see how he is going to apply it to the various topics throughout the book (public-works projects, price-fixing etc). I don't want to give anything away, but the lesson should give readers a different outlook on economics in general. He has great logic in making his case and the fact that he explains things so simply shows he has a deep understanding of the subject. The book doesn't go into really technical stuff, which should probably be expected given the title, but it explains the fundamental concepts of economics so well that the average person can move on to a more serious study of it.
1591396190|3.0|I read a lot of business books. I had somehow avoided this one for several years, but recently picked it up.<br /><br />I love the title.<br /><br />I love the concept(s).<br /><br />I am not impressed with the level of detail, or lack thereof, in the \\"How to\\" portion of creating uncontested market space.<br /><br />They do a good job defining a blue ocean and why it makes sense to pursue them, but if you didn't already know that the best way to win in business is to find spaces that have high demand and little competition, then you should probably start with something more basic anyways...<br /><br />Most business people who do any amount of reading will probably find this to be heavy on hype and light on follow through.
B00004R99U|5.0|I found this much more engaging than the first movie. The first one just didn't do it for me. I was like, Pocahontas and John Smith?! Ummm...what? I think a lot of people didn't like this one because there was such a disconnect from the original. Not for me, though. The first one had its merits, that's for sure, but I found this to be much more interesting. It felt more realistic than most Disney films because it addressed a fundamental aspect of life: people move on and change. We're not constant beings, as romantic a notion that may be. We fall in and out of love. In that respect, I was impressed that it had that much balls. Cause, you know, it's Disney. Love is forever and all that jazz. That's not a bad thing, either. It's definitely a positive outlook, but not too grounded in reality.     I loved the music of the first and it's just as good the second time around. I would buy the soundtrack if it were available.     If you're a loyal fan of the first movie, this one probably won't be your cup of tea. But hey, you never know.

B002RV01Q8|5.0|A very much needed new cd covering the best of Enya.  More of Enya's latest tracks are the mainstay of this collection with the never before released DVD videos and documentaries.    Enya holds a place in my heart unlike any other artist.  She is a masterful artist, painting each song with her own brand of unique heavenly vocals and amazing instrumentation.  Included are her latest offerings like \\"Trains and Winter rains, My! My! Time Flies!, Stars and Midnight Blue, Amarantine, The River sings and a never before released version of Aniron from Lord of the Rings.    This is an excellent compilation of Enya's latest tracks and DVD videos.  Do not hesitate to purchase this.  There is no better vocalist than Enya.  Her instrumentation is top notch and very relaxing; enter into Enya's dreams.
0895260131|1.0|Here's a guy who's written a book on such a rich and valuable topic as Islam with no scholarly merit whatsoever. His book capitalises on the fear and hate of many (mainly Christian Americans) against Islam. Look up his previous books and read the statements of his audience (who call for the killing of muslims) and it won't take you long to gauge that he embodies all the hate and islamophobia present in American society today.<br /><br />He selects random verses from the Holy Quran and then interprets them according to his own twisted understanding trying to prove that Islam and muslims are magically bent upon destroying all that exists. Another abdsurdity with this guy is that he portrays the Crusaders as innocent flower pickers. The same people who cannibalised a whole village in modern Palestine because they could not find any other food and were apparantly inspired by God to do so.<br /><br />All in all if you love to hate and have a lust for blood, this book will appeal. to those rational, free thinking individuals of the world, this guy is scum at the bottom of the barrel producing works even lower than that. Biggest waste of money ever!
B002GJT4XM|5.0|I really enjoy the Harry Potter Series! If you are a fan of Harry Potter this a great one to own.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I have been a proud owner of a copy of the original DVD release of Advent Children since the day of its original release, back in April of 2006. I have loved every viewing since then and did not think it would be possible to love the movie any more if I tried. Well, it turns out that I didn't need to try at all to love it more. Watching the Blu-Ray version instantly won me over all over again.     Bottom line: If you're a fan of FFVII but have never seen Advent Children before, the Blu-Ray version is the version to get if you have a Blu-Ray disc player. If you're a fan of FFVII and the DVD version of Advent Children and have a Blu-Ray player, then you also should really get this version. I understand completely how somewhat ridiculous it sounds to buy essentially two copies of the same one movie, but just like the jump from DVD to Blu-Ray with most every other movie, you won't look back here. Sure, you could watch an upscaled DVD version of the movie, but this is really much much better.     For starters, an upscaled DVD version will not have the extra 26 or so minutes added throughout the movie in this Blu-Ray release. You might think that wouldn't amount to much, but these little additions here and there - some, not so little - truly add more depth and clarity to the plot overall, as well as make the movie more cohesive. A fellow reviewer described the original DVD version as \\"an extended cutscene\\". After seeing this version of Advent Children, you'll feel the same way; as the title of this product states, this version is Complete.    The only criticism I have - and this is why my five stars are actually a 4.75 in disguise - is that like another reviewer mentioned, the visual quality varies from scene to scene. The added content is GORGEOUS, everything you'd expect from a Blu-Ray. Much of the original content is much the same. But, there are a few scenes here and there that appear noticeably fuzzy. Generally speaking, however, you may notice the subtle differences, but you won't care too much. The story is much more enjoyable this time around.     On one final note, it is still possible to choose to hear the Japanese voice acting if you wish, which is really great considering the original release had the same option. Of course, this time around, you can change the language and subtitles at will.     So, to close, I'd definitely recommend this Blu-Ray movie to anyone either newly interested in Advent Children or those who have already seen or owned the movie before. It's certainly worth the money if you're a fan of the film.
0446530573|5.0|Fantastic Cookbook. It was a gift and friend loves the book.  Quick Shipping. Excellent condition and price.
0062515675|5.0|An easy read but one you should take notes on as you read.  I got some new ideas but it was mostly things I knew, but this book put them together in a meaningful way.  It is one of very few books that I will read again.
B0026PW67W|4.0|Beautiful map. Fairly heavy weighted paper, and the folds are pretty easy to follow.  Good details on the map. You almost expect to see footprints waking around!
B002MW50KO|4.0|Absolutely the strangest Christmas album ever recorded. Instead of giving you chills it sends more of a grabbing, clenching sensation to the pit of your stomach. No one sings Christmas like Dylan. No one. Trust me.
B002TUU4EG|5.0|This is one of my top 5 movies of 2009. It's delightful, joyous, and adult in a good way. The marriage and continued romance of Paul and Julia Child was remarkable in its depth. The bonus bon appetit bag was fabulous, just the right size for a round loaf of french bread and some great cheese! I bought 2 and gave one as a Christmas gift.
B002OR18HQ|4.0|I actually saw this concert live when it came to California. Though it was rearranged some, it was fun to watch and relive the concert. What a fabulous bunch of musicians!!!!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I am very happy with this purchase.  I was unable to find this dvd in local stores for the holidays.  I was able to find it on Amazon for a great price!  It shipped quickly and was in excellent condition when it arrived.  We were able to enjoy it all through the holidays.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This movie had a lot of life's lesson's which Richard Farnsworth's character exhibits along his journey.  This is a great family movie and I could watch it again and again.   Though it is slow moving, it keeps your interest.
B002WY65W4|2.0|There is obviously HEAVY media spin going on with this film. There is no plot, nothing. Rent it. Trust me.
0763631205|5.0|This book remains on our coffee table. Our grandsons love the illustrations. It is a book they pick up again and again for us to read to them. They enjoy this book as much as we do.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan's rendition of all of the songs on this CD are unique. Her voice is even better than she was on Britain's got Talent.  Great CD and many genre included.
B002M2T1UO|3.0|I enjoy the Shield. It took me a while to get over the \\"uncensored\\" side of police work. However I grew to appreciate a different take of justice in the streets.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie changed the way I shop for groceries.  I was also driven to find more documentaries like it and educate myself.  If everyone could just see this movie I think people would stop acting like victims and start using their wallets to make change happen.  Instead, we make laws banning oversized gas station drinks and throw our personal responsibility to the wind.  It's bulls***.

0060254920|5.0|I had forgotten what an enchanting and original story this little classic was and treated my son to a hard cover edition for Xmas as his childhood one was looking a bit tattered.  Great book to read together at any age and surprisingly the story has stayed relevant and enjoyable - if you've seen the movie you must have the book.
006190385X|5.0|I have never been much of a book reader, but have been enjoying this book with all the stories the 4 boys write. Great for the U2 fan- a must have.
0920668372|1.0|I was really disappointed with this book after reading many good reviews and being told by friends it was a \\"must have and will make you cry\\".  No tears, only groans, it really didn't pull any heart strings for me and actually I thought it was a bit weird - as did the rest of my family.  I honestly don't understand why this book is so popular. Maybe I need some therapy...
B000KC8O3S|5.0|This score is right up there with the best blockbuster movie scores Hollywood produces. Television shows tend to be scored with one theme, played always with the title. The Doctor Who soundtrack is fabulous and exciting new music with different themes for different charactors and adventures that create a moving sound picture. Rose's theme is absolutly not to be missed!
B002TVQ4HG|1.0|The story plot of this movie sucked. It started going on a boat trip it ended going back on the same boat trip. She was in this time still world that she kept re-livin. The question is WHY. The movie did not give a reason. What happened to make her go into this state. It started in the time still state and ended the same way. I will never watch this movie again. I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go.
B0011NVC98|1.0|300 reviews already - I'll be brief.  This movie is just bloody awful!  Don't waste your money, for God's sake!<br /><br />The graphics aren't impressive (the characters appear plastic and stiff), the characters aren't sympathetic or interesting (except, as the other reviewer said, for Grendel), and I can't figure out how the hell Zemeckis got so many big stars to be in it.  Their acting ability doesn't overcome the lack of emotion in their characters' plastic faces, leaving me unable to connect with any of them.<br /><br />If you can find it used for $1, then buy it and watch it with friends, so you can make fun of it together.  Otherwise, ugh, skip it entirely!
B001FB4W16|5.0|Love this series....I'm hooked and am glad I own the first season. Very good series definitely worth buying let alone watching, which I have more than once.
B0010X745K|5.0|Just wanted to cast my 5-star vote for this excellent movie.  I'm no conossoiur, but I enjoyed it thoroughly; my mouth was agape several times from pure shock at the story twists.    Stephen King has definitely overcome his problem with crappy endings (I'm thinking mainly of the giant spider in \\"It\\") - The Mist has probably the best (surprise) ending I've seen, which pushes \\"Birdy\\" (Matthew Modine, Nicholas Cage) out of the #1 spot for \\"best endings in a movie\\" of all time. ;)    Also note:  I watched the DVD over a month after I bought it...and it froze up repeatedly throughout the movie.  The return period had elapsed, so I had to keep it.  A year later (same DVD player) I watched it and was pleased and shocked that I had no issues.  Glad I never fired off that angry letter to the manufacturer.
B001DJ7PNW|5.0|A wonderful presentation of a great film. Picture quality and sound are exceptional. As for the film itself it's a faithful presentation of Jim Garrison's book \\"On the Trail of the Assassins\\" in which the collation of evidence, overlooked and dismissed by the Warren Commission and the Government (obviously with intent - the alternative being incompetence) is displayed openly and honestly allowing the reader of the book and the viewer of the film to make an informed decision in regards to the assassination of JFK. Only the most mentally challenged people or those with an agenda would now dismiss the overwhelming evidence that shows that the President was killed by trained, paid assassins all organised and covered up by???? You decide!
B000ZECQ08|5.0|Product arrived in a timely fashion and in perfect condition.  Definitely would buy from this seller again.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I must admit that it boggles my mind to see so many unfavourable reviews of this wonderful, endearing adaptation of Jane Austen's classic. Cinematic gems are a rare thing these days. We seem to be surrounded by crass, unmitigated tripe (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, G.I. Joe, Old Dogs, the Saw series, etc.) that insult the intelligence of the viewer and seek to beat us over the head with special effects and casual violence. These films and many more are worthy of disdain, and yet what do we have here but a legion of people with the myopic effrontery to slam \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with a one-star review!! You people make a mockery of the rating system with your hyperbole. Many (especially old people) seem absolutely obsessed with the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version, which I liked very much as well, but thought was a bit stiff. I agree that the story moves a little too briskly in the newer version (I wish it were five hours long, too), but in all other respects I adore this movie.<br /><br />Keira Knightley is simply beautiful and luminous as Elizabeth Bennett, and Matthew MacFadyen brings real emotion and warmth to the proud character of Mr. Darcy. The chemistry between these two is exquisite. All of the other actors and actresses are excellent, as well, as is the cinematography. The scene in which Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, with the rain-swept countryside in the background, is handled beautifully; the emotions expressed in the faces of the two leads are spot-on and make the scene more heartfelt and engaging than anything in the 1995 version. There is simply more feeling in this version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" than in any other Jane Austen adaptation that I've seen, which is exactly want I want to go with the wonderful dialogue and piercing social commentary.
0790740443|4.0|This movie was very good with lots of action, good plot and characters.  My husband has been looking for this for a while and couldn't find it locally.

I highly recommend that you purchse both Season 1 and Season 2. I look forward to purchasing Season 3!![[ASIN:B001FB4VXU The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Second Season]]
B000WCBPOG|4.0|This soundtrack is great if you're a fan of the movie. There's one problem with it though, they left out one of the best songs IN the movie, \\"I Want You/She's So Heavy\\". There are other songs they could've left out such as \\"Mr. Kite\\". Otherwise this is a very good soundtrack to go with an awesome movie!

1400031362|4.0|I'm really not sure how I feel about Alexander McCall Smith and Precious Ramotswe. He's really an engaging writer-- there's something very gentle and folksy about his tone. I have the feeling that he writes for the many people. Doesn't talk down. Doesn't mock.<br /><br />But then I get uneasy. Which many people? A Scottish fiction writer is so far removed from the setting of his series. I find myself anxious how this book is experienced in Botswana. A Google search revealed a terrible story how in filming a pilot based on the books, black extras were paid far less than standard by the (white) South African production crew. I read references to accusations of being patronizing, removing dignity from his subjects. I guess I can see that. But then I wonder-- would the same stories written by a black Botswanan carry the same freight. What about if the stories had been transplanted to explore the foibles of a small Scottish town. Would the difference in reception make a difference in how I should look at this? Can you remove a work from the context of the writer?<br /><br />In the end the question becomes relevant because of the lack of African women voices writing about themselves. I'm not sure I find a problem with Smith as such. His books are pure entertainment. Hopeful. And (dare I say it?) well intentioned. The trouble is that for the vast majority of people, this may be the only look they get at Africa, the voice of African women. That lack is what gives Smith more weight than he deserves, either negatively or positively. As one view in a thriving ecosystem of other viewpoints, this uneasiness would cease to be relevant, I think.<br /><br />I realize I haven't said much about what I think about the book. Uneasy about my own enjoyment pretty much covers it.<br /><br />Let the accusations of being too PC commence. :)
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I LOVED this movie. At first I wasn't so sure about it, but I loved the concept of it. Being a fan of Jane Austen's books also and a daydreamer, I loved how they changed the story without changing the story. I found it very creative. Definitely a chick flick to add to any Pride and Prejudice collection.
B0000CDL93|2.0|I realize this movie was made in 1991, before a lot of research had pretty solidly confirmed the Warren Commission's findings, but that doesn't excuse the dishonesty presented in this fictionalized 'documentary'. When the president and the governor are placed in their 'properly assigned seats' (Kennedy seated to the right a few inches of the governor and leaning out the window, the governor sitting on a 'jump seat' a few inches higher than Kennedy) the need for a magic bullet disappears. There have been at least 2 moving car recreations (with real live dummies pretty closely resembling not only the size, but also the inside bodies of Kennedy and the governor.) In one of these recreations, the bullet wounds on the dummies match exactly the wounds on the actual bodies, minus the wound to the governor's thigh. (The bullet hit an extra 'rib' inside the dummy, and therefore didn't have enough momentum to injure the dummy's leg.    Some other less than honest claims...that Oswald was a poor shot. Not true. That Oswald couldn't get 3 shots off in 9 seconds. (A few marksmen were able to get off 3 shots, hitting the intended targets, in just under 9 seconds.) That he couldn't make it down 4 flights of stairs in 90 seconds without being winded. (A man of similar size and fitness was able to do it in 48 seconds without being winded.) That he couldn't make it to the point where he had the confrontation with the cop in under 15 minutes. (In another test, the same man was able to get to the destination in about 11 minutes.)    There have been a handful of documentaries shown on the Discovery Channel, History Channel, etc. Each of the above points, as well as many others, are demonstrated fairly clearly...Unsolved History: JFK Beyond the Magic Bullet; Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy; JFK: Case Not Closed; and Investigating History: JFK Assassination each dispel the mistruths demonstrated in the JFK movie. (all available on Amazon)    Bottom line, it's ok to have doubts about Oswald being the lone gunman, but the only hard evidence in this case all points to Oswald.     As far as the movie itself goes, I guess it was ok. The one scene that always stuck in my mind was the one with Joe Pesci getting choked by someone. In one frame, he has his hairpiece looking ok. As the choking continues, it flashes back between the hairpiece being halfway down his face, and then being back on right again. It looks something from a bad spoof movie. Or are we to believe that the guy choking him is also moving his hairpiece back and forth?

B002QW7AJY|1.0|The first half of the movie you spend saying wtf over and over, and not the good kind where you want to find out what's going on, the wtf why am I watching this.  No character development at all. And when it's over you're just so glad its over you don't even try to put the pieces together. There are so many other great movies in this genre don't waste time with this one
0974869449|5.0|These cards are great! I'm a beginner in Japanese and I'm using James W. Heisig's, Remembering the Kanji Vol. 1 (and Vol. 2) along with these cards (and the second set of flashcards) to teach myself the Kanji. While they don't cover all 2042 Kanji in the Remembering the Kanji books, they have dramatically improved my memorization and retention of a lot of characters. The cards are very sturdy and well designed. The front gives the character, the stroke order, vocabulary using the character, and similar Kanji that you can mistake for the character your looking at. On the back you are given the On and Kun readings, the meaning, and the translation of the vocab on the front. The only negative statements that I can make about these cards relates to the second volume, and that is that they are no longer split into decks like in the first volume (it's because there are about 3-4 times as many in this set), and that they smell bad! Like an unpleasant chemical kind of smell. But I still definitely recommend these flashcards and the second volume if you are learning the Japanese Kanji. Buy them!!!

B00015TWTE|5.0|I love this 2 cd set because every song on it is great. I especially love the remix sound of certain favorites. And I love Little Suzie, and Childhood. Michael is so incredibly talented. If you gathered all the people who ever sang on Broadway and any world stage ever, Michael would outperform them in a few brief notes.
B002NUULNG|3.0|Since this movie is so popular and believed to be a kind of legend and there's a lot of review on it, I'm not going to comment on movie itself. I'd say it's not much worth buying blu-ray version if you have DVD one (hopefully with upconverter). AQ seems better but I don't see any big difference in PQ between two formats.
B000H6SXLU|4.0|This is a fun old fashioned movie. I bought it for my son who is learning to tap dance at the age of 32. he loves it too. Just sit back,relax and enjoy. They don't make entertainment like this anymore.

I saw this movie in the theatre with my family when it first released, and love having it as part of the series.

Can't wait for the last installments, even though Deathly Hallows will be released in two parts.[[ASIN:B000ZECQ08 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Two-Disc Limited Special Edition)]]
006097625X|5.0|I've first see this book in my friend's home. I was amazed by colors, quality of paper and last but not least the content. I've never thought about the comics books in the way this one explains. and the form the explanation takes is adding a flavor to the reading experience. i'm enjoyed reading it (i did it already twice). this is a book that you can take from the shelf at any time, open at any page and read. of course, to do it you need first read it once from the first page to the last... :)

1400032717|3.0|It was just a bit slow and a bit to easy of a read for me. I found it hard to relate to the characters as it was a bit extreme. I also found it to be very unrealistic and I don't think that the author put too much thought into how this kids life would REALLY be like or what he would ACTUALLY be thinking. Not a book of my taste.
1400052173|5.0|I read a glowing review of this book last week in the NY Times and downloaded it immediately on my Kindle.  Once I started, I couldn't stop reading it.  It is incredible that this woman's story has gone untold for so many years.  Skloot does a skillful job of interweaving Henrietta Lacks story with Skloot's own quest of trying to uncover Lacks life and connect with Lacks surviving family members.  This will no doubt end up being one of the best books of 2010...don't miss it!
0810983915|5.0|my daughter loved the book. she has the others. she's hoping for the next one.
1400064287|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I originally rented the audiobook and ended up purchasing a hard copy afterwards that I could use to reference later as needed. The authors have many good points and use excellent examples to make them. The only part I didn't entirely agree with is the inverted pyramid. Yes, it's what they teach journalism students, but great writing doesn't always follow this model. Not from the lead paragraph anyway. All in all, however, \\"Made to Stick\\" is great.
B0033B5XCS|1.0|Lets start off by saying they are obviously like everyone else does when something is remade or made into a sequel re-releasing this box set to prepare for the remake of the awsome horror series from back in the 80's. Let me just say that the remake looks really good, except for the fact that they recasted Freddy? How can that ever happen? Anyways...    This box set in my mind is considered theft from your wallet or purse. They re-release them and with no special extras. You get what I  mean though! Just the regular first released editions and also with no 3d glasses as in the first dvd box set released. Plus NO Freddy Encyclopedia with info. on Freddy? Who would want this box set for more money out of your wallet when you can hurry and buy the original dvd box release with a bunch of extras for dollars less? WARNING THOUGH: They will purposly make the first box set out of print just so you'll have to buy this ridiculous box set for more of a cost.    In my opinion...Your wasting your money!!!
0783233477|5.0|What a startling movie.  I haven't been impressed with many and this one is great.  It is very inspiring as well as entertaining.  I have watched it more than once and expect to watch again.  The representation of who the man is really suits.

B002Q9VPFM|5.0|I was very pleased when I've opened the package and stumble upon a beautiful box with a very complete material from \\"Watchmen\\". I you think this was a great movie then you need to watch the \\"Ultimate Cut\\" with 3h40m long that includes the complete vision from Zack Snyder, including the Black Freighter stuff!    The box itself has a wonderful UV metallic finish and a magnet to close the lid. The box also includes the digital copy from the theatrical version (you have to download it though - the disc included is only for authorization purposes), a special features disc and animated comic version (2-disc) which it is great!    Well, in short, I recommend it very highly to all Watchmen fans!

044654146X|5.0|Israel is the world's techno-nation. At the start of 2009, more than 60 Israeli companies were listed on the Nasdaq, more than those of any other foreign country. This amazing economic has occurred in the face of war. Also during the six years following the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000, Israel suffered from terrorist attacks and second Lebanese war, and yet, the share of the global venture capital market did doubled to 30 percent.    What more amazin is hat there are more new innovative ideas that coming out of Israel than there are out in the Silicon Valley right now!!!    What I liked in \\"Start-Up Nation\\" book is that the authors tell real stories of entrepreneurial success, such as Shai Agassi and his electric-automobile technology idea that now in the process of creating in isreal and Europ.    It is not easy to discover why Israel, a country of just 7.1 million people  has managed to become the first technology nation. But tHIS book is defenetly know how to present and shine a spotlight on Isreal success.    Mirit

B001T6KMKM|5.0|This album has been something that I have wanted to hear for some time. Widely heralded as \\"The Greatest Jazz Concert Ever\\" this recording presents a portion of the concert quite faithfully. I was unaware that it was re-released in 2009, which is great, because copies of the original LP are currently selling for over $100. This album is great fun, and sounds pretty decent (considering the technology for live recording available at the time). The interaction between the players is fun and the performance comes to life on this record. I enjoy it quite a bit.

1582406723|2.0|If you've got a jones for some \\"survivors in a post-zombie apocalypse world\\" then this title will scratch that itch.  It's got zombies, human survivors fighting amongst themselves as they come to grips with their new world, and... well, that's it.      It jumps right into the action which is nice.  However, the action and the characters aren't particularly new or interesting in any way.  The dialogue can be brutally on-the-nose at points.  I enjoyed it well enough since I was in the mood for people trying to survive an epidemic of zombies and I look forward to the rest of the series.  There's just nothing really here to rave about.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|This movie does a great job of adding a modern touch to Jane Austen's Emma while keeping the period drama feel. It's worth a watch if you like Jane Austen to see how the book is handled. Everyone has their favorite version, of course. Each one emphasizes different parts of the text.  It's a great love story however it is packaged. This is  why Clueless (based off this story) was so fun!  There are things I like better in the other versions, but, as a whole, this is my favorite adaptation.  The character of Mr. Knightley, a Jane Austen favorite for me,  is handled well in my estimation.  Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley  has the hard task of starting out like a brother to Emma and slowly transitioning to passionate love interest in a believable way. He does a good job.  Mark Strong (previous BBC version) had a hard time breaking out of older brother and  Jeremy Northam (Hollywood version) never seemed to really start there.  Others have stated that they think JLM looks to young, but I believe he is the exact age of Mr. Knightley in the book, thirty six.  Worth the cost if you like Austen movies!

B0035WTJFW|5.0|Steven Spielberg's Minority Report is one of his greatest films.  It is a triumph of story and storytelling, a dark and futuristic film noir that is both wildly entertaining and satisfyingly thoughtful.  Tom Cruise gives one of his very best performances to date as a \\"pre-crime\\" cop on the run.  Roger Ebert named this the best film of 2002 and with good reason.  Minority Report is essential viewing.  I couldn't be more excited about its release on Blu-ray.  Let's just pray we get the amazing image quality on this disc that the original film displayed.

0061730327|5.0|This is one of the most inspiring stories of the human spirit and ingenuity I've ever read. William's efforts to educate himself and build a windmill in the face of extreme poverty and adversity are heroic and extraordinary. Once you've read his account of his family's struggle for survival during a disastrous growing season in Malawi, you will never think of food the same way.
0307278255|5.0|Mark Twain is reported to have said that the difference between the right word and the almost-right word is like the difference between a fire and a firefly.  Jhumpa Lahiri has a knack for getting it right, and her prose practically glistens on the page.  Her stories are not particularly uplifting or inspiring, but they seem real--real stories of flawed and struggling human beings who are also trying to get it right.  Each story in the collection stands alone, but we meet some of the same people again and again, just as we do in real life, and see their lives unforld--sometimes with promise, sometimes with despair.  Whatever happens to them, they will live on in my memory.
B001QOGYBS|5.0|While I think UP was the finest animated film of the year, THE FANTASTIC MR. FOX was in my opinion the second best animated film of 2009.  As stop action it isn't as polished as Nick Park's films along the same lines (which pretty much remains the Rolls Royce of stop animation), but it has virtues of its own, including absolutely spectacular voice over work, especially by George Clooney in the title role, though Bill Murray as the Badger and Michael Gambon as a deliciously evil farmer.  The film is also laced with remarkable wit and intelligence.  The result is one of the freshest, most original animated films that I have seen in a long, long time.<br /><br />When my my daughter was very young we read through just about all of Roald Dahl's books.  This was just about the only one that we didn't read, so I have absolutely no idea whether this is in any way faithful to the original.  I can state, however, categorically that this is the best adaptation of any of his books.<br /><br />This is also another fascinating addition to the collected works of Wes Anderson, who has produced a string of interesting if quirky movies.  I honestly think this might be my favorite of his films; actually, that is not quite correct.  I definitely think that this is the best of his films.

I love the part where Anne says boldly before she is beheaded...\\"My Elizabeth will be Queen.\\"

0142001104|5.0|I love this book! This is now one of my favorite books to recommend and to give as gifts to friends and colleagues.<br /><br />Rosamund Stone Zander is a family therapist and painter, and her husband, Benjamin Zander, is the conductor of the Boston Philharmonic - a volunteer Orchestra that is rated among the best in the world, where most of the other orchestras in this league are salaried. Over the years of their professional and personal collaborations, Ros and Ben have developed approaches for reframing challenging situations in positive ways, so that people who might otherwise end up in conflict are able to find their ways to negotiate mutually acceptable and satisfying resolutions to their disagreements.<br /><br />Simple steps are detailed for re-conceptualizing prickly and knotty issues so that both sides discover ways around apparently insurmountable blocks and discover cooperative, mutually satisfying resolutions to problems. Much of their approach encourages the development of positive attitudes and expectations about dealing with such situations.<br /><br />Each chapter is richly illustrated with personal anecdotes of how the methods Ben and Ros recommend have been successful in diverse challenging situations. Here are but a few of the many gems from this sparkling book:<br /><br />An apocryphal story<br /><br />A shoe factory sends two marketing scouts to a region of Africa to study the prospects for expanding business. One sends back a telegram saying,<br />SITUATION HOPELESS STOP NO ONE WEARS SHOES<br />The other writes back triumphantly,<br />GLORIOUS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY STOP THEY HAVE NO SHOES.<br /><br />Ros and Ben point out that when we get our backs up, much of what we assume to be fact is actually a reality that is created in our imaginations. By keeping this in mind, we allow ourselves to open to new possibilities in our negotiations.<br /><br />A simple way to practice it's all invented is to ask yourself this question:<br />What assumption am I making,<br />That I'm not aware I'm making,<br />That gives me what I see?<br /><br />And when you have an answer to that question, ask yourself this one:<br />What might I now invent,<br />That I haven't yet invented,<br />That would give me other choices? (p. 15)<br /><br />Reframing one's situation in a major way:<br /><br />You define yourself not as a piece, nor as the strategist, but as the board itself, the framework for the game of life around you. Notice we said that you define yourself that way, not that you are that...<br /><br />When you identify yourself as a single chess piece - and by analogy, as an individual in a particular role - you can only react to, complain about, or resist the moves that interrupted your plans. But if you name yourself as the board itself you can turn all your attention to what you want to see happen, with none paid to what you need to win or fight or fix.<br /><br />The action in this graceful game is ongoing integration. One by one, you bring everything you have been resisting into the fold. You, as the board, make room for all the moves, for the capture of the knight and the sacrifice of your bishop, for your good driving and the accident, for your miserable childhood and the circumstance of your parents' lives, for your need and another's refusal. Why? Because that is what is there. It is the way things are.<br /><br />You ask yourself, in regard to the unwanted circumstances, \\"Well, how did this get on the board that I am?\\" or, \\"Now, how is it that I have become a context for that to occur?\\" You will begin to see the obvious and then the not-so-obvious contributions of your calculating self, or of your history, or of earlier decisions that landed you where you are, feeling like a victim. This reflection may bring forth from you an apology that will knit back together the strands of raveled relationships. And then you will be standing freely and powerfully once again in a universe of possibility. (p. 146-7)<br /><br />This book is very highly recommended for anyone in the helping or managerial professions, as well as for anyone wishing to improve their negotiating skills in their personal lives.skills in their personal lives.
1400052173|5.0|The events in Rebecca Skloot's \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" (Crown Publishers) are true, although sometimes you'll wish that they weren't.<br /><br />Reading like a detective story and with at least as many subplots, the book begins with Henrietta Lacks, a pretty, warm, and vivacious Black woman born in Roanoke, Virginia. In early 1951, Henrietta is 30 years old, living in Baltimore with her husband, \\"Day,\\" and five children, two of them still in diapers. She doesn't much like going to the doctor, but she finally decides she can no longer ignore her troubling gynecological symptoms, which include bleeding, pain, and the sensation of a \\"knot on her womb.\\" At Johns Hopkins Hospital, the problem is diagnosed as cervical cancer.<br /><br />What happens next forever changes the lives of her children and the course of medical history. Without asking permission and without ever telling her family, one of the doctors takes a sample of Henrietta's cancer cells for a physician, George Gey, who had been making repeated attempts to grow cells in culture for research purposes. Although most of the cells Gey had previously tried to culture had died and the remainder hardly grew at all, Henrietta's cancer cells are different. They're tenacious, growing and multiplying like nothing he has seen before. He calls them HeLa cells (from the first two letters of Henrietta Lack's first and last names)--a moniker now instantly recognizable in biomedical laboratories around the world.<br /><br />The book's author, Rebecca Skloot, who is 27 when she first starts covering the HeLa story, guides us through the fantastical events that follow over the next half century with journalistic--and then, as she builds relationships with Henrietta's descendants, personal--zeal. In crisp, clear prose drawing on extensive research, she tells the often-tragic stories of the lives of the five children left motherless with Henrietta's death on October 4, 1951. Skloot also follows the path of Henrietta's other legacy--the HeLa cells, which are used to help find a vaccine for polio, are sent into space, and eventually reveal the virus that sparked the cancer that killed her. These two plot lines come together abruptly when decades later Henrietta's adult children discover--to their pride, fear, and anger--that part of their mother lives on.<br /><br />By the time you turn the last page of \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" you'll have a new perspective on today's scientific, medical, and ethical issues, and a vivid image of some of the men and women who have lived and died with these questions.HeLa cells, which are used to help find a vaccine for polio, are sent into space, and eventually reveal the virus that sparked the cancer that killed her.

B001US29I2|5.0|This lego set roxs!  There are more functions than whats on the box.  The ewok glider has this on thingy that drops rocks on the scout troopers.  This toy is so much fun.  But I would be careful with the sheild bunker.  It breaks kinda easy so be cautious moving it.  It's really awesome if you have some extra ewoks and/or stormtroopers.  Get this toy, but be cautious of the shield bunker, I suggest adding extra baseplates for extra durability.  I recommend this toy.  It has hours of fun. I'm 13, and it took me 3 hours to build, and it'll keep kids happy.  I also recommend buying Mythbusters DVDs and watching those, too.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|After having watched the TV special, I was anxious to purchase this DVD. The ladies get better and better with each release.  I am looking forward to attending a live performance of this show! If you own any of their other DVDs, don't miss this one!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I first saw this movie at a friend's apartment two years ago and had never heard of it at the time. I remember thinking, man, this movie is going to suck, after watching the first ten minutes because it was kind of slow. But the second the first song was sung, I was completely hooked, and by the end I was almost cheering it was so good (it had been awhile since I'd seen a REALLY good movie). I don't know how to explain why this movie is so good besides the fact that it is so REAL. The cast is fantastic, the storyline has a nice twist to it, and the music, oh the music. This movie contains some of the most raw musical performances I've ever seen, Glen Hansard sings with so much emotion you're on the edge of your seat every time. I bought this movie on DVD and basically gave it to everyone I know this Christmas. So far, everybody (and it was a rather diverse group) has loved it. I could watch it all day.
0143114085|4.0|This might be considered a prequel to The Wrong Mother (American title of the author's third crime novel).  I purchased this because I had read and enjoyed that later and popular third novel by Sophie Hannah.  While not quite as good as that novel, it is good and I enjoyed it.  It too focuses on motherhood in the relationship of Alice to her daughter, Florence.  But there is also the relationship between her husband, David, and his mother, Vivienne; and that between Vivienne and her grandson, Felix, by David's murdered first wife, Laura.  We also get a glimpse of detective Simon Waterhouse and his mother, as he is introduced.  In this novel, the author seems to experiment with focusing on fatherhood represented by the relationship between David and his son, Felix; and between David and his missing father.  Of course, in addition to the mystery of \\"where is baby Florence?\\", we also want to learn who really killed Laura Cryer, David's first wife.    What I was also hoping for by reading this earlier novel was more background on the relationship of Simon Waterhouse and Sgt. Charlie Zailer.  I wasn't disappointed.  The personality of their chief, Proust, is developed here but his relationship to his wife is not presented as it is in the later novel.    A somewhat lesser focus is the sanity of David and that of his mother, Vivienne.  In sum, I recommend this book to readers of The Wrong Mother.  I am reading Hurting Distance, her second novel, in which motherhood and fatherhood are not the foci; but rather male-female relationships.  Simon and Charlie appear in that book and it is important for you to read if you are interested in that pairing.

1400052173|5.0|Wow. This book should be required reading for scientists and students of life. The true story of Henrietta Lacks and her family has finally been told, beautifully, in this book. The book encompasses science, ethics, and the story of a family who was terribly wronged in the pursuit of scientific research. I could gush about this book for pages but I'll try first to hit the main points of why this book is so remarkable in list form for the sake of brevity:<br /><br />1. The author clearly developed a strong relationship with the Lacks family, which was absolutely critical to ensuring the story was told accurately and with the respect to Henrietta Lacks that was so deeply deserved.<br /><br />2. The storytelling is amazingly moving despite the need to convey a lot of scientific information. It reads like fiction.<br /><br />3. Ms. Skloot's research into the science is impeccable.<br /><br />4. The book is FAIR. It presents the unvarnished truth, obtained DIRECTLY from as many prinicpal people involved in the story as is humanly possible. It would have been easier to simplify the story into heroes vs. villians, but Ms. Skloot deftly handles all sides of the story.<br /><br />For some detail: I have worked with HeLa cells in the past, but did not know even the barest information about the story of Henrietta Lacks until a few years ago. It simply was not common knowledge, until a few less ethical folks released her name and medical records to the public. This obviously should not have been done without the express permission of the Lacks family, which Ms. Skloot obtained. In the past, others have not been as ethical. The book covers Ms. Lacks' early life, how her cells came to be harvested, and what happened to both the cells and her family afterward.<br /><br />The contributions of HeLa cells to science are absolutely staggering and cannot be over-stated. The sections where the science was described were clear and accurate. With the story of Ms. Lacks' family interwoven,this book was fairly close to perfect. I found myself moved to tears several times because of the fate of the Lacks family and Henrietta's daughter's indomitable spirit. I do not think anyone but Ms. Skloot could have written this book. She worked with the family for over a decade in order to get the story right. This was critical, as the family had been wronged too many times in the past.<br /><br />Thank you for this astounding work of art.

He was truly an artist that kept his hand in all the creative aspects of his show.  The concert tour would have been unbelievably GREAT!

The book was 2 inches by 3 inches!! What a joke! I thought I was getting a good deal until I recieved the product. If I had of known that the book was useless I would have payed more for a regualar sized book. However, the size of the book wasn't disclosed in the sale. This was the first time I ever bought an item from Amazon because of a fear of being ripped off, and sure enough I was!!
B002RSDW8A|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my wife. It was watched by 3 generations of the family, and all enjoyed it. Some of the sexual content was remarkable for our 12 and 13 yo grandkids, but we all got through it uneventfully. Fun concept; funny movie. Would have loved to have seen the two J's actually meet, but that would have been fiction and the movie was real.
0691142165|4.0|It is very rare these days to find a book that does not engage in wild hype regarding the causes of the current financial difficulties. Many of these books blame financial modeling for causing what some have characterized as a \\"meltdown\\", or \\"bloodbath\\", while others point to the failure of regulatory agencies. But this book is different, in that it places the argument into the context of history.  Further, instead of using purely descriptive narrations about financial crises, it relies on empirical data. Even better, the authors of the book do not slip into a plutocratic mindset when defining what a financial crisis is. There is no hint anywhere in the book that the authors view a financial crisis according to how much money is lost by wealthy individuals. Indeed, the authors emphasize that rich nations are in no way \\"special\\" and suffer the same financial debacles as \\"emerging\\" countries.<br /><br />As the title implies, the authors' main thesis is that citizens, government officials, and economists for centuries have assumed that every period of crisis encountered is different than what has occurred before. Any insight gained from financial crises in the past is partially or totally ignored, with the implicit assumption that what is occurring now is unique or cannot be understood by reference to the past. In particular, actions taken by governments in the past to alleviate inflation or debt that complicate or worsen the problem are wiped completely from memory.<br /><br />Some other good features of the book include:<br />- The authors make their case with empirical data, and one fourth of the book is devoted to data appendices. As they remark, data is used rather than \\"narratives of personalities, politics, and negotiations.\\"<br />- The development of various indices for characterizing financial \\"turbulence.\\"<br />- The inclusion of many fine quality graphs that illustrate the defined indices and historical data.<br />- The reminder that events judged to be \\"rare\\" at a short time scale may in fact not be if viewed at long time scales. \\"Black Swans\\" at short time scales may be \\"white\\" or \\"gray\\" at long time scales.<br />- The discussion on the \\"lending boom\\" of the 1990's and its connection to the financial crises in Mexico and South America.<br />- The development of a quantitative measure of \\"vulnerability\\" to debt increases.<br />- The discussion on the need for legal frameworks for enforcing debt contracts across borders.<br /><br />Some of the disappointments in the book include:<br />- Not much discussion of how extremely rapid or innovative technological advances can instigate extreme financial volatility.<br />- The omission of the discussion of the role of financial engineering in the recent turmoil.<br />- The degree to which financial modeling has in instigating or complicating financial crises.<br />- No discussion of how the Basel I accord may have softened the blow of banking crises after its inception, and how Basel II (or III) may assist in averting future banking crises.<br />- Only cursory discussion as to why trade balances provide a measure of capital flow cycles for a country being studied.<br /><br />In general a good book, and this reviewer hopes that it will make it to a second edition after more data from the current crisis is obtained and analyzed.y in fact not be if viewed at long time scales. \\"Black Swans\\" at short time scales may be \\"white\\" or \\"gray\\" at long time scales.   - The discussion on the \\"lending boom\\" of the 1990's and its connection to the financial crises in Mexico and South America.   - The development of a quantitative measure of \\"vulnerability\\" to debt increases.   - The discussion on the need for legal frameworks for enforcing debt contracts across borders.

B002WY65VU|5.0|Some genre's have been done to death (no pun intended).  The Vampire and Zombie franchises lately seem to have so many entries that I simply ignore and avoid them whenever possible.  Give me [[ASIN:B00006G8K0 Horror of Dracula]] and [[ASIN:B001BSBBDA Night of the Living Dead - In COLOR! Also Includes the Original Black-and-White Version which has been Beautifully Restored and Enhanced!]] any day.    ...and then there is Zombie Land.    The performances in the picture are very good and the tone of the movie is reminiscent of [[ASIN:B00006D295 The Rocky Horror Picture Show (Widescreen Edition)]] but it is the writing that really makes this picture shine.      Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick wrote a classic of comedy (far superior to their earlier claim to fame [[ASIN:B0001XAODO The Joe Schmo Show - Season One Uncensored]].  The timing and the pace of the film really works as does the \\"Rules\\" popping up on the screen.  That is not only good writing, but good editing!    The basic plot is simple, College recluse discovers that the world has become populated with zombies due to some disease.  Comes up with a series of basic survival rules to get by.  Teams up with a crazy man who is on a quest to find that last Hostess Twinkies before their expiration date on what becomes a combination road trip, zombie killing and teen romance movie.    I don't want to give out more info, you really have to see it to appreciate it.      So go see it.    Oh one side note.  Author Jonah Goldberg has stated categorically in [[ASIN:B002BH3Z8O The Corner on National Review Online]] that his bestselling book [[ASIN:0385511841 Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning]] is totally useless against Zombies so unless you are buying it by the palate [[ASIN:1400049628 The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead]] would be a better survival guide.

0553381687|4.0|'A Game of Thrones' is an epic tale of honor and betrayal that has enough twists to keep you reading.  George R. R. Martin is a fantastic story-teller and really breathes life into all his characters.  There was a lot I liked about this book (especially the characters and the settings) and it really felt like an original story, however it is a big book and only an introduction to the series.  There was a point towards the middle of the book I really wished I hadn't started.  The story slows in some places and it can sometimes feel like a chore, but I guess that's okay if you're someone who really appreciates fantasy.<br /><br />I personally recommend borrowing this one, and being prepared to wait a long time to see the end of this series.  It's a good story, but not one to rave about.  I will probably read the next in the series at some point though.

B002WY65VU|4.0|Once in a while a movie will come along which will actually pleasantly surprise you and this one certainly fits the bill. Countless filmmakers have gone to the Zombie well,over and over and over again for years and most leave you with that \\"been there,done that\\" feeling.But this 88 minute flick Zombieland,puts its' own fresh twist on things and comes up with a little winner.<br />The story involves a group of four people going cross country trying to stay alive from the world wide Zombie threat around them.The how and the why of the plague is only briefly touched on as having something to do with a contagion mutating from mad cow disease and into humans.We know our main protagonists only through city names.The first and the narrator of the film is Columbus(Jesse Eisenberg).He is a young man who is forced from his solitary existence due to the terrible threat,and sets out for Columbus,Ohio to seek out his parents.His plans get sidetracked when he meets up with Tallahassee(Woody Harrelson).Tallahassee it seems has lost his family and while not the easiest person to get to know,is a Zombie,butt-kicking pro;quite fearless.One of the last pleasures Mr.T has,is to get a hold of a twinkie.To this end they stop into a grocery store but just end up getting their ride stolen(Cadillac SUV) by a couple of con-sisters(Witchita-Emma Stone and Little Rock-Abigail Breslin),who pretend one of them is infected and is about to turn.But the boys soon get a new ride of their own that is a step up;a big yellow Hummer filled with lots of ammo and guns.<br />Back on the road the guys come upon their stolen truck \\"abandoned\\" but get taken in once more and get their new ride hijacked by the same girls.But now they are at least all together and the girls head for the Pacific Playland Park,just outside L.A.When they arrive in L.A. Columbus suggests crashing and getting some sleep.To that end Mr T suggests heading for some swanky digs and suggests a stars home;one of his heroes,Bill Murray.Just as they are settling down Bill Murray himself,dressed as a Zombie(to blend in with them) frightens Mr T and Witchita.After Mr T finishes gushing all over Bill they decide to pull a trick on Columbus and Little Rock.Bill walks in on them Zombie-like but quick acting Columbus pulls out his trusty shot gun and shoots Murray.The wound is fatal and he ends up dying!<br />Next morning the girls again steal off with the ride heading to the park as planned.This time the guys know where they're heading and follow them.The girls arrive at night and turn on the power to the entire park.They might as well have turned a big neon sign saying\\"fresh meat-come and get it\\",as every Zombie within sight of the park comes-a-runnin'.Soon the girls are surrounded by the creatures but eventually the guys arrive on cue.Through some tense moments and fancy maneuvering the guys rescue the girls.The movie ends with them driving out of the park,the grounds covered in bodies.<br />The movie is quite a smart one with snappy dialogue and the on going narrative by Columbus makes it sound more like a travelogue with tips throughout.His tips always consist of the do's and don't of living in Zombieland such as the \\"double-tap\\",\\"don't be a hero\\",\\"always check the back seat\\",\\"beware of bathrooms\\",etc.And each tip is usually shown through cgi on the screen in big white lettering.The action/fun on screen that comes across throughout is a constant reminder not to take what you see or hear too seriously.The time with Bill Murray is a hoot and Murray's reference to seeing Eddie Van Halen at the Hollywood Bowl as a Zombie,or just walking onto a golf course and playing nine holes with no line up and uninterrupted is just typical of the dry sense of humour you will hear in the film.It is what really makes it what it is and work so well.<br />In the technical department the film has been transferred wonderfully onto DVD,no problems there.The extras include several deleted scenes,a featurette,actor/director commentary and the trailer.<br />In conclusion if you want a snappy,smart and funny Zombie movie with a nice twist to it,this is for you.The script and plot are both well written and the movie moves along well throughout.The producers got everything they could out of each scene and then moved along to the next,trying to keep the pace on a even keel;and generally they succeed.Before you know it this enjoyable flick ends after around 85 minutes and,it seems,all too quickly.But they have invoked that age old show biz adage:\\"Leave'em wanting more\\".Sequel anyone?er.

1400082773|4.0|With apologies to my conservative friends, I enjoyed this book and have true respect for the author.  Not only was it very well written, but I found myself drawn into the story of Barack's early life, particularly his journey to discover and define the person he would become.  Did he do (and think) things I find extreme?  Of course he did!  Having long since left my own 20-something years (thankfully) undocumented and in my wake, I certainly have no stones to cast.  Whether you agree with his politics or not, his story is uniquely American and I believe, great.  If I ever got the \\"you can invite X-number of fameous persons to dinner\\" fantasy, Barack Obama would make my short list.    I listened to this one from [...], read by the President himself.  I must admit to having a preference for authors reading their own works (even if they aren't as good as professional readers, I find it more genuine).  I'd strongly recommend that format to anyone considering this book.

I'll give Brown two thumbs up for his research on Freemasonry and symbology.  For me, that was the best part of the book.  The story was very similar to Brown's earlier books, exciting but superficial.  The dialogue was the most lacking part of the book, but then I wasn't really expecting much or reading for the dialogue.    I'll consider this the last read of \\"summer reading\\" and get back to work now... :)

0684824906|3.0|Overall I enjoyed reading this book.  Having read very little about Lincoln or the Civil War, I found this book informative and a rather quick read.  I'm always surprised when reading history that we (humans) keep making the same mistakes over and over and over.  There are many parallels between the challenges faced in this book and our modern times.  It takes the passage of time to spot a Lincoln.  I wonder if we have any around today?

0316017922|2.0|All right, I realize I am bucking the trend here on this book, but I really didn't care for it.  While I thought it was well written, and I found the facts amusing I disagree with the author's conclusions.  Perhaps I just have too much of the \\"hard work equals success\\" paradigm in me, but I think this guy is wrong.    ...Spoiler Alert....    The author makes the point that Bill Gates is who he is because of his unique opportunities, same with certain NY Jewish lawyers, hockey players, and 19th century industrialists.  I agree with the role of opportunities (luck), and also with his assertion that it takes 10,000 hours of experience to really become world-class at something.      The point the author overlooks is opportunity cost, that is, what were Bill's other options, his \\"plan B\\".  What did Bill give up to found Microsoft?  So what if Bill was born at just the right time to catch the PC revolution, that doesn't mean that if he were born 5 years later he'd be making fries somewhere!  That's like me saying that I define success as being Miss USA (I'm a 300+pound balding American male).  Guess what, fate didn't deal me the cards to have a good shot at that crown (I'd loose swimsuit for sure), but that doesn't mean I'm a loser, or that I can't be an outlier and be exceptional at other things.  I truly believe that the magic is to discover which opportunities are available, and then be prepared to take advantage of them.    As a counterexample, I'll offer up Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Was he born to be a bodybuilder, a top action movie actor, or a politician?  Regardless of what you think of his movies or his politics, this guy has reached the top repeatedly.  The point is, I believe greatness is available to any of us if we can identify and accept the opportunities we do have, then work to get it.  While no amount of work will win me that beauty contest, life does have other opportunities if I'm willing to identify and pursue them.

0345349571|3.0|Barbara Tuchman sticks us right into the heart of the late Middle Ages, geographically and temporally, in her 1978 history \\"A Distant Mirror\\". Her talent for penetrating, minute analysis and ripping narrative are readily apparent in the opening pages. But as the book goes on, it is weighed down by a pedantic downbeat perspective and a failure to connect an overlong book thematically.<br /><br />At the center of \\"A Distant Mirror\\" - and its key fault as I see it - is Tuchman's focus on one French nobleman, Enguerrand de Coucy VII. Tuchman needed a hook to tie together her sprawling narrative of this far-removed time, and Coucy has the advantage of being in several important battles and intrigues. But as Tuchman readily acknowledges, not much is known of Coucy, and that vagueness leaves a hole at \\"Distant Mirror's\\" center.<br /><br />France in the 1300s was an ugly place to be alive, she makes clear. There was the Black Plague, which killed off roughly half of the population. The Hundred Years' War was fought largely in France, leaving things such a mess King Jean II chose English captivity over his throne. You also had two popes, each declaring the other a heretic; a Moslem invasion in the East; and roving bands of mercenaries who shook down towns and popes alike for easy gain.<br /><br />\\"Oh happy posterity who will not experience such abysmal woe and will look upon our testimony as a fable,\\" says the contemporary historian Petrarch in one pungent Tuchman quote.<br /><br />Tuchman acknowledges at the beginning that the time period is one that defies modern understanding, then goes on to call out the rampant hypocrisies in withering tones. Calling the book \\"A Distant Mirror\\" begs a parallel the narrative doesn't really deliver - that 1300s France is analogous to the world in the late 20th century.<br /><br />Which is fine enough when what Tuchman does deliver are such gems of scholarship and writing as her heartbreakingly detailed chapter on the Black Death, about as winnowing a read as anyone could ever endure. We also get snapshots of characters like John the Blind, a Bohemian king so combat-loving that at the Battle of Crecy he had his retainers lead him sightless into a suicidal charge, so he could go down swinging. Tuchman is at her best explicating the origins of the Hundred Years' War.<br /><br />As the book goes on, and on, characters become more of a blur and Tuchman's disengagement more apparent. With the exception of Charles V, who restored a semblance of stability to France, the parade of leaders on both sides of the Channel proves uninspiring. Tuchman brings up Coucy a few times as a rational exception to a mad age, even to the point of taking exception to criticism against him by Jean Froissart, the main chronicler of the time and Tuchman's acknowledged chief source. Alas, Coucy's presence at battles like Mahdia and Nicopolis aren't exactly points in his favor as a ranking figure; they were French defeats brought on by bad leadership Coucy either directed or failed to counter. I was not impressed by the guy.<br /><br />The first half of \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a fascinating read, and people with an interest in the period will gain from the book. With her scholarship and her ability to deliver an interesting story, Tuchman always merits attention. If only the focus had been better.ndure.

0307266303|5.0|There's a lot to say about this book and no shortage of press tackling the cultural and sporting aspects; so I'm gearing my review to people who looking for a good read rather than a book about running.<br /><br />Born to Run ties together a story of a Mexican Indian tribe, the perils of running shoes, emerging anthropological theories, the lifestyles of American ultra-marathon runners, and even squeaks in some nutritional information in one slender book.  To McDougall's credit, the topics transition smoothly from an impending race to the author's own running history.<br /><br />During a stint as a sports literature editor I was amazed daily at the sheer awfulness of some of the stories - and even the good stories were rarely told with a thought to form.  My first happy surprise with McDougall's book was that he knows how to write! He writes with humor, a good eye for detail, and an ability to weave in facts and context to provide a full, wonderfully human, picture.<br /><br />As I mentioned, he ties together chapters on, say, the history of an Indian tribe with his quest to find an American vagabond, a few pages on studies of running shoes and their detrimental effect on runners with a few more pages on ultra-marathon culture in America, then circles back to the Indian tribe and continues the story from there. I like to picture McDougall looking at his unfinished chapters wondering if he should try to form some type of cohesive narrative and push out a book that no one will probably read, or publish a series of six or seven tight articles. Glad he went with the book.<br /><br />There two criticisms worth mentioning.  First, while McDougall paces his words with the care an Ultra-marathoner paces a race, he adds jarring cliff hangers at the end of chapters.  One chapter ends with \\"Little did I know we'd be running for our lives.'  These cliff hangers are annoying and the calamity they foreshadow never occurs.  But, compared with enjoyment of the rest of the book, easily forgivable.<br /><br />The second criticism stems from the book's press.  Readers often expect facts and figures about running and some sort of deep cultural history and social commentary on the Tarahumara tribe,  No. Not in this  book.  If this book did try to offer a deep and meaningful understanding of anything, it would have to loose the cursory information of its other topics - which is exactly why this book is so fun to read.  The book treads lightly on all of its subjects; each area gets enough light to reveal outlines and cast a few shadows.  For any parts of particular interest to you - the internet is at your disposal.d criticism stems from the book's press.

I keep the four aggrements in front of me everyday as I work.  I try to live up to them.  My life is a lot more manageable when I do this.  I reccommend this book to all who seeking a better way to live their lives.[[ASIN:0060778407 The Sins of Scripture: Exposing the Bible's Texts of Hate to Reveal the God of Love]]
B001AXEOKI|5.0|The old songs from the album sound crisper and louder, but the best part is the demos, b-sides and live performances -  definitely recommended to all Cure fans out there.

B00006JDVV|5.0|We start in London underground in a tunneling project. When they cut into a void, a problem for tunnel rats, they send in the son of the shift foreman who happens to be visiting mom after school. He doesn't know what's in there but he knows he's scared & goes for momma. She's the expert here.<br /><br />A raging fire blows down the tunnel as he & his mom get in the cage of the man lift. This works until the dragon climbs his way up the shaft just happening to kill mom as he passes them. The son is left shaken & stirred.<br /><br />20 years later the dragons dominate the world as mankind has found no way to deal with them. There are small pockets of people in hiding trying to survive & outlast the dragons. Add a great homage to Star Wars here. Enter the Americans- who have quite by accident discovered a way to kill dragons & are headed to London to kill the main trouble maker. You'll love their answer. The rest of the show centers on what a dragon does to make him & his kind vulnerable & whether its best to wait out the dragons or go offensive & kill them. Terrific stuff here. No lag at all. The end of the confrontation is blow you away stuff. End of a great movie.<br /><br />There are great actors & actresses in the main roles here but the lead star is the DRAGON created for this movie. This is what a dragon should look like. So often they are too long or too bulky or too winsome or too anything. Dragons are referred to as worms also & need to be strong so flight looks possible & speed obvious. They must be muscled & fearsome as the ultimate predator. Aggressive, smart & calculating they should be a master of tactics & of course the fire must be beyond description. This dragon is all that and so much more. I've waited years for someone in the movie business to make a dragon like Morkeleb the Black from Barbara Hambly's book \\"DRAGONESBANE\\". If your not familiar with this story I recommend you get it. Used they start at 1 cent.<br /><br />This is the best look I know of into a dragon's mind & purpose. REIGN OF FIRE matches DRAGONSBANE in my mind. I now have hope for Smaug in THE HOBBIT. Hope they don't blow it. REIGN OF FIRE GETS 5 STARS.rpose. REIGN OF FIRE matches DRAGONSBANE in my mind. I now have hope for Smaug in THE HOBBIT. Hope they don't blow it. REIGN OF FIRE GETS 5 STARS.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these ear phones!  I can't say enough good stuff about them.  The last pair I bought was 10 years ago and I took them with me everywhere, travelling, in my hand bag, on the train, plane, you name it.<br />They are just AWESOME for physical exercise.  Some earphones pull out of your ears when you run with them, these ones don't budge. They're just great, and the quality is awesome.  The price is fantastic.  A comparable pair cost 10 times more!  I purchased 3 of these as they no longer offer them in my country so shipped them all the way home.  Can definitely recommend these if you want to do physical exercise or just wear them with you when travelling or at work.  Really durable and great quality - super light and flexible too .  Thank you Sony!
B0035JRW2M|5.0|One of the best Vamp shows on TV. a must to see if you are into good suspence, Go Stephen and Damien.To me its better than The Twilight and New Moon sequels. Just taking to long to get to the heart of the show. Should be on with a new episode twice a week instead of just once. Now that we are hooked, they will end up cancelling it because it has a cult that follows it now, which i mean alot of fans. As good as True Blood.
0316069906|5.0|Astonishing in its crystal clarity and profound thinking. Cuts away to the literal bare bones our culture's ideas and paradigms on eating animals. A must read for any thinking person who is looking to improve the world we all share.
B000ZELISO|4.0|Well this last show wasnt what i expected, not as good as the other shows of the series,but its all adding up to the conclusion. Would recommend it if you are a follower of the sequent. Go Harry
B002WY65VU|4.0|When I first saw the trailer for 'Zombieland' I thought it looked like it would be a fun time......I was right! 'Zombieland manages to make an extremely stale genre fresh again. A great cast and some hilarious nods to horror films add up to a very fun and entertaining film. This is film is not scary, it is a pure \\"all out\\" comedy. There is some nice gore sequences which are essential to good zombie films and the mix of gore and horror will make some folks giddy and other puke!<br /><br />Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg deserve most of the credit for this film as they are the most unlikely buddy team I've seen in a while, but it makes it all that much funnier.<br /><br />The film is short on plot(aren't all zombie films?), but not on laughs, so if you want to have a few and not have to think for an hour and a half 'Zombieland' might be just what you need to get you through the winter.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|For an artist as talented as Sting, it is very hard to overstate how disappointingly painful it was listening to this compilation. Artistic license aside, this \\"work\\" was a dreary, boring and completely useless waste of polycarbonate.   Don't expect any enjoyable holiday tunes on this disc - depressing dirges are what you'll get...

B0017XCDN6|5.0|Letters from Iwo Jima is perhaps the best war film ever made.  It is worth seeing over and over again, getting better over time.  The common story lines and common images shared by both Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers enrich both movies.  It is worth reading Eugene Sledge's With the Old Breed to get a richer understanding of the experience of the soldier on the ground and the combination of hatred and respect felt by both the American Marines for the Japanese and the Japanese soldiers for the Americans.  Two scorpions in a bottle.  What makes this film unique is that it presents the Japanese experience with honesty and sensitivity.  The cast is extraordinary, as is the writing, the cinematography, and the integrity of the story telling.
B0009X7664|4.0|I teach this novel to a 10th grade class and showing the movie is an integral part of the unit. To Kill a Mockingbird is my very favorite book and the movie is one of my favorites.
B000MTPANQ|4.0|The only reason I did not give this cd and dvd set 5 stars is that some of the video on the dvd is only of a tape player playing the song. It's amazing to see how Neil played these songs and to listen to his banter and retuning to drop d or double drop d between songs.
0810995212|5.0|After reading so many negative reviews I have to say I expected to receive a sloppy, handwritten mess of a book..I am happy to say that is DEFINITELY NOT THE CASE! The illustrations are wonderful and the research that had to be done to compile this magnificent   tribute was well beyond my expectations. I have to wonder, as I was scouring the book , what in the world was so wrong with the writing. Each section was thoughtfully worded and many details were fascinating and I am certain to be fact.     I guess I am not that well versed on what a writers skill or wording SHOULD be but I must say I was thrilled to learn more about many of the details of \\"Joe's\\" life so long now private. I found myself overjoyed and many of the images I had never seen which was even more exciting! I was even more elated that they seem to start at the beginning and follow to the end of his career. In my eyes, it is all perfection.   Again, I am only speaking as a Leyendecker fan, not as some prolific writer or art critic. Seems to me that if you want a beautiful reference book on his many beautiful works and at least want to have some insight on the man behind the masterpieces, this would be a wonderful choice for you. I am sure they may be some details that may not be 100% accurate but I do not get the feeling that the author believes that each detail is fact, as there were so many private moments throughout Layendeckers life. If you are looking for a book to enjoy and to share with others , this is a great read. Thanks to all of those who were a part of the making.! I feel a little closer to the legend than I ever have...! I am ordering a few more for gifts!  Just the time to gather all of these beautiful works of art is well worth the price!
0783225733|5.0|Sure, everyone knows that the Apollo 13 crew gets home safely.  So it's a testament to how good this movie is that it still enthralls the viewer despite already knowing how the story ends.  All the elements of a great story and movie are there - acting, directing, script, drama, suspense, some humor...everything!
B002RSDW80|1.0|What a stinker!!!!  A waste of money.  Wait for it to come on tv.    Amazon's delivery and purchase was just fine, it's the movie that was so bad.  That's time I'll never get back!!!
6305897786|2.0|Listen, I liked this movie as much as everyone else below.  Johnny Depp is an amazing actor - the characters were well defined - good story - the movie was soooo good - and then it ended and you're like \\"What?\\" - I did of course figure out what happened but it did not fit the pace of the rest of the movie. It could've been soooo much better.  The whole pace of the movie builds you up for some spectacular ending that never happens.  The ending was a disgrace to the entire movie and made me hate the whole thing.  Whats the point of a great story line if it doesn't carry you through to the end?  If they had made a sequel that picked up from the end, I may have reconsidered my position on this movie - but since the sequel never came this movie is a disgrace to good movies.  Needless to say, I was very offended.  This movie would've easily been one of my favorite movies but now I will never watch it again.    Great story line, great acting, great directing, TERRIBLE ending.

0723247609|5.0|The Complete Tales of Beatrix Potter book arrived in record time and it is such a classic book that I will read it over and over again to my son.  I grew up with Beatrix Potter stories and it is fantastic to have the whole set in one book.  I thoroughly recommend this book to any mother with children from ages 1 - 21!!  Classic and funny with awesome pictures and takes you back to yesteryear.....highly recommended
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This is by far one of the best scores you will hear from a film.  That Hollywood gave the Oscar to the mediocre score from BB Mountain is ludicrous [\\"there was a boy who liked another boy\\", guitar:  bling bling. Wow, wasn't that terrific]. Hollywood itself is ludicrous.  There is nothing in decades that can compare to the work that Marianelli did in this film.  He is a great artist  and the Academy is laden with the flakiest of flakes.      They ignored Marianelli in order to make a token award.  They did it in 2010 in the supporting category.  Get outta here. Hollywood you are garbage.
076790592X|5.0|This book became one of my favorites ever. The story is not just about death but about life. As soon as you start reading this \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" you will start comparing Morrie's, Mitch's, and your life. Very inspiring. I recommended this book to many of my friends and they just fell in love. There are also YouTube videos showing real Morrie's interviews and DVD so check them out, too. Enjoy!
B002ONC9MS|2.0|\\"An education\\" is very well acted. Art direction and recreation of the 60's are impecable and there are many enjoyable witty dialogue lines. The movie is never boring and keeps you expectant all the time for that turn in the story that will surprise you and make it memorable... but it never comes.     It is true that such a \\"twist\\" is not essential. Being able to captivate an audience by re-telling a very well known old story also has an enormous merit. But \\"An Education\\" does not achieve this either. The misfortunes of an innocent young girl deceived by a charming older man have been brought to the screen many times, and so have coming of age stories, both categories into which \\"An Education\\" could be classified. However, this version is certainly not one that will be remembered among the best.     It could be forgiven that the \\"innocent girl\\" appears too far from gullible. It could be argued that she is rather more dazzled than deceived. However, there is an extremely naive treatment of some characters that are essential to the story, especially the initially strict father who falls too easily a prey to the charm and lies of the mature man that chases his teenage daughter. Even if it could be accepted that, in reality, he is letting her go willingly, expecting that in this way (just as she does) she will get more from life and more easily than by pursuing her studies at Oxford, the movie never portrays his inner struggle or thought process. The same comments apply to other characters, like Emma Thompson's headmistress, who is described in an extremely simplistic way as a decidedly moralistic anti-semitic bitch, uncapable of giving a lovable brilliant girl who made a mistake a second chance. So the story becomes not only predictable but very linear, with many of the characters becoming just decorative accesories (very pleasant to look at, that it is true) to help move forward the narrative of the story, but devoid of any depth.     The moralistic end with the maincharacter's redemption, though not necessarily a negative had the whole story been more solid, adds another element of predictability that does not help to enhance one's final impression of the film.     In short, this is a movie where all the formal aspects have been very well taken care of. If it had had a script with a bit more creativity or better defined characters, it could have been believable and, who knows, even memorable. Unfortunately, it is just as a gift box wrapped in bright paper and colourful ribbons, which you untie and open only to find a pair of socks which you have already worn before and not even your best.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|Was a little disappointed that cover slip was missing and the cover was a little scratched. DVD in good shape, and that's what I REALLY cared most about.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|I saw Jesse Cook at the Britt Festival in Jacksonville Oregon in 2008. He was fantastic along with his fellow musicians.  There was a gigantic line for his CD's. What a beautiful guitar sound.  Great background music but too fast for massage.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle dramatically exhibits her versatility on this \\"must have\\" CD.  Each track showcases her vocal artistry, in that she embodies the emotion of each song and, in so doing, sounds like a completely different  singer.   I have heard it a thousand times and never get tired of it.  Of course, I have favorites which I simply MUST repeat several times as I listen through the CD.  I cannot wait until she releases her next CD.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|Loved the movie and had to have the music. Great combination to listen to his talent come alive again and again.

0307588335|5.0|I was encouraged to read Larry McDonald's account of the fall of Lehman by my father, and I have to say it's one of the most well thought through, riveting accounts of the business you could find. This is a masterful work, written with the shrewd observance and honesty that made McDonald a success in the first place. The story is also keen at showing examples of how someone ought to act in life situations, contrasted with the many who run in silent conformity. Unsure if it was by the author's intent (although I presume it was), the story yields a good many lessons in virtue.     Even for someone far outside the New York reality of brokerage firms, global banking, and global economics, this is an excellent read from the very first page. It should be made into a film, because it's an intense ride from which the full effect has probably not yet been felt. Amazing work!     RJ
B000HEWEDK|5.0|What a great movie with good actors. The robot is a good actor too!!  You just can't go wrong with this SciFi classic.  Another movie for your DVD collection.  Buy it, you won't be dissappointed.

B000ZECQ08|5.0|I might be of the older generation, but I am hooked on Harry Potter.  I have every one of JK Rowlings magical stories. My latest is Harry Potter and the Half  Blood Prince.  It's great, so entertaining, so fun and it sure gets my energy level up..  For everyone who wants some \\"get-away\\" fun for awhile, I say buy any one of the stories, if not the whole series.  You won't be sorry..    JK Rowling is so very clever. She believes the impossible and I believe her astonishing tales.  Wish I was one of her friends.
0312370849|5.0|A powerful story about courage and love transcending the generations. I really liked this well written, well told story!
B002T9H2MO|5.0|This movie is now on my top ten list of favorite movies of all time.    This film serves as a reminder to hollywood that films with characters, even the same character, repeated (you'll \\"get\\" this reference as the movie progresses), are better than films with nothing but skin, body fluids exchanged meaninglessly, and more skin shown as disguised porn, which means porn sold as a movie or television show.    True filmmakers, as this incredible director and writer have shown us, need not 200 million dollars to make a movie that allows for great interest and fascinating developments. A truly gifted filmmaker, such as the one who made Moon, will (we can only hope) hold true to the vision of a contribution to the dialogue of what we stand for, and who we are, defining us via the dialogue is what art is, and should be. And the term \\"art,\\" as used here, means the creation of that which sustains the soul and nourishes the mind. This goal need not be pedantic; this goal need not be puritanical, but it does need to nourish the need for creative mileu which bathes us in questions that turn over us day after day.    More than two weeks after seeing this movie, I'm still thinking about it. Major kudos to all who participated, down to the last sound guy or lighting guy, unappreciated yet whose contribution and caring, so made this a fabulous movie.    One can only hope that this director, and the actor sam rockwell, will continue on the trajectory of a path, done so well as to embarrass all of hollywood for pumping out so much trash, when opportunity for such as this indelible and moving movie, is available to them.     No nudity. No gratuitous sex. No drugs. Some profanity. Sheesh. What must Hollywood think?     Thanks so much for making this movie, and showing all the coming up directors and actors that there is greatness that can be achieved, with relatively little money. (believe this movie was made for only five million...)
B000G6O2TS|4.0|The tournament knights and dragon were purchased for a grandson who has a vivid imagination.  He loves to play with his kings, knights, dragons, etc.  He is young, but is thrilled to have these to go with his castle.  They are very durable, but some young child who does not understand their purpose could be hurt with some of the edges and require some adult supervision.  The figures are made very well, and even though my grandson will be four in May, he is very happy with the toy figures and can entertain himself for long periods of time.  S. Robertson
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This controller is phenomenal.  I was expecting to have to wear this controller in for a while, but after about 5 minutes it was already playing better than my previous controller.  Not to mention the 10' cord is amazing.  If you need a new controller you can play with normally right away, this is the controller for you.
0756655730|5.0|A spectacular volume laden with photographs, artwork and information. Definitely a must have for any paleontology library.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This was AWESOME! I loved all the extras and special features - it really added to the value of this movie.
B000000U5L|5.0|I love this Sountrack and bought it again because I only have the vinyl.  I want to get back to my workout program that I used back in the '80's and this soundtrack used to pump me up and get me super motivated.  I have it now and can't stop listening.  I love the movie also, recieved that as a gift.  Nothing like some Rocky IV to get pumped!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This movie was one of the fondest moments of my childhood.  This DVD helped me relive those moments, and the behind-the-scenes helped me realize why those memories were so fond.<br /><br />The movie was enjoyable to watch.  The segments on the making of the film reveal why it was so successful, why I enjoyed it so much when I was a kid.<br /><br />There is only one complaint I have, and that regards the packaging.  You realize early on that the primary storyteller, a key character, was Bagheera the panther, and he has been my favorite Disney character.  Yet he is not at all on the packaging of the film, either on the front or on the back.<br /><br />One Disney film gives you the idea that all of Disney's animated films are classics, and I strongly disagree.  However, this one definitely is a classic.<br />It may not have been faithful to the original writing, and maybe its differences are what made this movie so effective.
B00275EGX8|5.0|This movie is thrilling, disturbing, and cathartic.  It is seemless and well-crafted...you feel like a voyeur instead of a viewer.  Deserves to win best picture, no doubt.  I don't know if this is an \\"owner\\" as movies like this really wind you up and take a lot out of you...not something you want to do over and over.  But if you are a collector of fine films, or this genre then without a doubt purchase this film.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|An excellent movie I saw when it first came out and thought it was so good, I wanted it in my collection!  Terrific acting!!
B0001JXQDI|4.0|I've only a few DVD audio discs, so I'm not sure how qualified I am to review them, but I did enjoy this one. What I gleen from these discs is clarity on all the various parts that went into the final recording. Being a professional musician, I really enjoy being able to really separate the various tracks with ease. I've also got EJ's \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,\\" a Sting DVD and a few others. The Steely Dan folks are known for the attention to detail and it really comes through on this disc. Everything is VERY clean... very well orchestrated. Great music, great disc.
B00011CZRE|5.0|A thriller movie depicting the Seven Deadly Sins.  Terrific actors!!  An extremely suspenseful movie!
B002QY9RMA|4.0|Some of the songs like \\"Single Ladies\\" are great.  Most of the songs are just OK.  Not many songs on each CD.  This one would be better to just download the songs you like.

1400063736|5.0|This is a beautifully written novel woven in a tapestry of human struggles and sensitivity. The author has captured the essence of the many varied spirits, their strengths, and vulnerabilities. I generally don't read fictional books because they tend to depart too far from reality which leaves me feeling very much like there is a far distance between authur and truth. To write a book like this reflects the heart of a writer who has in some way lived the experiences he conveys.

1591843162|4.0|Who would want to be \\"the same\\" when you can be indispensable! Linchpin is a direct and well researched and perfectly organized book for anyone who can benefit from being indispensable. Being different, unique, cherishing what you do, making your work your art, no matter what level of success. This book will make you realize your potential, and really show you what to do. You won't forget what you've read here either. The insight Seth gives you is unique and will help you change your thinking. You will take a deeper look within yourself to break the habits that stop you from being truly indispensable. Seth's books are always great reads filled with information but also fun! This one reminds me of the greatest success book I've read which is The Quick Way to Power Success And Abundance.

1593082037|5.0|Get this two-volume Barnes & Noble hardback edition. The paperback version is hard to see in the skimpy center margins.  The hardbacks are small enough to be held comfortably, and the print large enough to read easily for most people.  All the Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes stories, plus the four short Sherlock Holmes novels.  Helpful introductions and brief notes.    A complete collection at a bargain price.  Unless you want to wait indefinitely, you may have to look elsewhere [[...], etc.] for the Volume 2 hardback, which originally was cheaper than the paperback.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|We got this movie quite a while ago and just got around to watching it. I remember hearing mixed reviews when it was first released, so was reluctant to take the time to actually sit down for a few hours and watch it. It turned out to be a great movie! Very gripping and entertaining though also very sad at times, because you know it was based on a true story. Angelina Jolie does an excellent job in this role. One of the few negatives is that the movie is a tad too long. If it could have been condensed a little and shortened by about 20-30 minutes it would have been even better. Highly recommended!
B000MR9D5E|3.0|I bought this for my parents who have not seen the series on TV.  Great content of course but if you have seen the HD version this  one falls short. If all you have is a non-HD TV it is a great value  at $30.

B000SEHJGQ|5.0|Bukowski's brilliant semi-autobiographical novel is a darkly comic reflection on being an adolescent boy in suburban Los Angeles.  He perfectly captures both the humor and the pain of growing up, with Ham on Rye being equally hilarious and terribly grim.  If you have never read Bukowski this is where you should start.
0307454541|5.0|Cool cool book.  I will definitely read his second book, \\"The Girl Who played with Fire.\\"  He also wrote a third before he died, don't know if it's titled yet.  Excellent character development.  Great story, fun read, nice literary style.  Larson's a winner.  Too bad he died already ...
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I love this version. The casting is excellent for Emma, Mr. Knightley, Miss Bates, Frank Churchill, and especially Mrs. Elton! Mrs. E is so much fun to see: full of herself and just as obnoxious as you expect. Much livelier dances than I've ever seen in an Austen film. Absolutely beautiful music plus the dance between Emma and Mr. K is so moving - combination of the music, the dance itself, and their faces is simply arresting. My very favorite incarnation of this story yet.

The tie in from the past to now was very well done, attention to detail shows the briliant Nora Efron at her best.

As New Yorkers we thought this was an interesting local story to share with our kids.  Its up to a parent on when they feel like the content/message is appropriate for their children, but our toddlers really liked the story.
0739337270|5.0|I listened to this audiobook for my book club.  The reader is just fantastic, he sounds like Alan Rickman - a perfect voice for \\"Death\\".  He drew you into his story perfectly.  I puchased this book for Christmas for my son, it's a book everyone should read.  Very highly recommended.
0312370849|5.0|Excellent book. It is a work on fiction but created in a historical setting. Very well written. I couldnt put it down, highly recommend it.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|This movie follows the Potter series quite well. I found the movie easier to follow and digest than the book. As Rowling gets darker and darker in this series, the plot gets very disrupted and hazy. Like most movies, this one digests the plot and presents the basic story well. I do miss the early Dumbledore, but, alas, he is also no more. Before the actors get longer in the tooth, I hope they get the story finished.
1402577923|4.0|As some people know, Cracker Barrel Restaurant that is all along American hiways have audio books to loan.  A refundable down payment minus $4.00 rental fee and you have an audio book for the length of your trip that you turn in at the end, or exchange for another along your trip.  I have never listened to one. \\"Prey\\" is my first.  It was so interesting and kept me awkake, entertained, and engrossed, that I would tell my husband not to stop for even bathroom breaks!  I didn't want to stop, I wanted to keep on listening!  He even enjoyed it.<br /><br />I have ordered \\"One Second Later\\" audio for the Spring break trip.  I read the book and found it totally awesome and for me life changing.  My husband doesn't like to read.  So, I am hoping he'll find it as good as I did.
0446560065|5.0|Having seen the short clips on you tube and also seeing it on tv made this book a definate must have!  He is just like my cat! The whole book is just brilliant!  I actually bought a couple of extra copies as presents for friends - and they loved it too!  Can't wait for the nest film clip!
B001YV504U|5.0|My husband tells me that the reason I don't appreciate Field of Dreams is because at heart, it's a movie about fathers and sons. I suppose that's true; at Christmas, my husband, his brother, his father, and his nephew (8 months old) all sat spellbound.
B001V9VE4A|5.0|This review will be a short one.  I listened to this book for our bookclub.  I like a book with a good plot, and this one delivered.  There were a lot of surprises and twists and turns that were unexpected.  The reader was very good, too.  Highly recommended.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|DVD works perfectly. This is another home run movie from Quentin Tarantino. But I am a huge fan of Tarantino. It is a fantasy movie not a factually accurate historical movie. It is a fun ride imagining what it would have been like if there were a death squad known as \\"The Basterds\\" who happen to be all Jewish except for Lt. Raines. Lt. Aldo Raines (Brad Pitt) gets better and better \\"marking\\" the survivors and he wants his scalps. The character is part Native American and I think the scalping is an homage to his heritage. And, the markings involve a hunting knife to cut a swastika into the 1 person's forehead that they decide to send back to Hitler to torment him. Brad Pitt is not a favorite actor of mine but he is perfect for this roll.
B000AP04OM|5.0|THis was a Christmas gift, so I don't know the quality of DVD.  Was sent in a timely manner and purchase of DVD was flawless.  Thanks
1401323820|5.0|I watch the series on TV every Monday Nite, but when I found that Amazon.Com had the mentioned book...well this was even better.  The price was right,the review and information was right to the top and to tell the truth I hope Amazon has pre-ordering for the next book which is due out in Sept. 2010. I have passed the word about to others at work and they have also seek their copies on Amazon.Com. At first it was No Way...I said go check it out...Great Job! Keep the excietment going. A very Pleased customer, and Highly recommend this book to anyone who Loves a Very Good and Suspenful Book until the last page. D.Taylor

B0009MAP9A|5.0|I love his first three albums, I'm a big fan of acoustic guitar music. If you want to see where a lot of your favorite bands and artists got their inspiration, just give this one a whirl. He's the one who started it all.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I looked everywhere & this was by far the best price for the blu-ray.  It arrived quickly & went right under the Christmas tree for my grandchildren.
B0030SCPZ2|5.0|Three masters in their craft on film. I was surprised @ Jack White's inclusion but was very entertained. Glad they had him in it. Three points of history are a well rounded view. White's Coke bottle guitar is priceless. Literally.<br /><br />Combo of personal history, playing, and just general view towards life/music. Page's soul crushing meet with Muzak was enlightening. White is the low tech point of view and The Edge(?? lol don't care how he got that name) the high. All three are masters to me. A joy to watch a pro do it right.<br /><br />Page: Dynamics, Light and shade.  Whisper to the thunder. Sort of invite you in.  It's intoxicating. From Jimmi an understatement.<br /><br />And thank you Mr. Page for remixing Led Zep footage in surround and DTS. That's the best music DVD or CD I own. Clean, warm, and not over processed. Here is the DVD:  [[ASIN:B00008PX8P Led Zeppelin]]<br /><br />Three cool people playing, talking, and having a good time. Great.
B001EN71DQ|4.0|It took them long enough, but they finally put out the first three Star Wars movies in a boxed set.  No surprises here, but I wanted the complete set.  The movies are better than they are given credit for.  There can't be too many surprises when you know who has to survive and what the general situation is at a later time.  But on their own, they are enjoyable and it is nice to see details in Episodes 1,2, & 3 that portend events in Episodes 4,5, & 6.  George Lucas is consistent.  Still, while there are few surprises with this set, the whole story is laid out, and we can go back to it at anytime.  Too bad he gave up on episodes 7,8, & 9.  I have no idea how the third trilogy would have developed.
B002MW50KY|5.0|Christmas in the heart seems exactly the Christmas album Bob Dylan would create if Bob Dylan made a Christmas CD.  Which he did.

B000ICLRIE|4.0|This uncut version added lots of developmental information to make the story better and complete. The completeness of information made more sense and provided a better flow for the story. The theatrical edited version was too brutally edited.    Nicely done. I like it.
B0026P3G12|3.0|Although she has a beautiful voice every song sounds the same.  All the songs seem to have the same slow pace.  Kinda depressing.
1423119509|3.0|Nice Packaging.  Bought this primarily for my daughter to read to her 7 year old.  Fun story for kids.  Very boring and choppy for adults.  Chapters make good stand alone reading for kids.
0061650994|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter for Christmas. It is well written for children and illustrated by the same gentleman that illustrated Lemony Snicket's \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\". It is a wonderful edition to anyone's library: young or old.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|this purchase came in a quicker than  expected. The quality of purchase was almost new. thank you very much
1572814136|5.0|have not been a fan of the Rider-Waite decks since first seeing them. The unappealing colors didn't grab me at all, and I am all about color. The Universal Tarot almost satisfied, but the colors, while beautiful, were too subdued for me. The Radiant Rider-Waite fits the bill. The symbolism is there. The colors are deep, rich and...well, radiant! The facial expressions are clear. A easy deck to read, esp. for a novice. Of these decks, this is the one for me.
B0000C9ZSV|1.0|Hendrix's live albums never come anywhere near the perfection of the studio albums. Not just because he was wasted, though that appears to be why this music is just sloppy.
B001TOVZYQ|5.0|The most favorite of my Donnie Yen Collection of dvds.  The next one after this would be his Iron Monkey!
B000VSBX34|5.0|When I watch this movie (again), I remember how I loved the Beatles in the 60's. The plot is inane, the music is classic Beatles, and the Beatles play themselves. Leo McKern (later Rumpole of the Bailey) was hilarious in this film. When my grandchildren, who are ages 6 and 9 come for an overnight stay, they love to watch this movie with me. The 9 year old is now a true Beatles fan - the 3rd generation!  Watch this movie again just for fun and remember the good times in the 60's.
0140042520|5.0|Most peaceful book I have ever read. Language you could fall in love with:    \\"I staggered up the hill, greeted by birds, and looked at all the huddled sleeping figures on the floor. Who were all these strange ghosts rooted to the silly little adventures of earth with me? And who was I?\\"    \\"When I went back in the moonlight to my same old tree stump the world was like a dream, like a phantom, like a bubble, like a shadow, like a vanishing dew, like a lightning's flash.\\"    As you read it, you feel that you have learned what the protagonist has learned, that you can see what he sees... you become him, just simply serene.
B000002NE4|5.0|I never buy actual CDs anymore, but had to make an exception for this one as Amazon didn't have it for sale digitally. That said, it has probably become my favorite Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds album (the others I own are From Her to Eternity, Your Funeral... My Trial, and Let Love In). He is undoubtedly an acquired taste and I can see how people might generally dislike this music, but I find that once you dip your toes in the more palatable songs you gain appreciation for the more eclectic tracks. I don't love (or even like) every song, but he takes you to such a different place mentally that you can still appreciate what he is trying to convey and the unique manner in which it is delivered.    For this album specifically... I like that most of the tracks seem more basic and raw than what I'm used to. It's nice to focus on his voice and the lyrics with minimal theatrics. There are occasional religious references, both subtle and blatant, that I find intriguing in many of the songs. Without thinking too hard about it, my favorite tracks are probably (Are You) The One That I've Been Waiting For? (of course-that's why I bought it in the first place), Brompton Oratory (which, by the way, is a Roman Catholic church), and West Country Girl (which I really feel showcases Cave's capability for musical and lyrical genius).    To wrap it up... this CD allows me to enjoy Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds in a way that is unique to this collection of songs. It may not be representative of the tracks you might come across on their other albums, but it helps me look at and enjoy all their music from a different perspective.
0688002307|3.0|The book is good, however, I would not recommend ever buying any products from the company I purchased this book from- (greatbookdeals)... This is by far the worst place I have ever made a purchase from and I am saying this in a nice way. Greatbookdeals have to have the worst communications and shipping on planet earth.. Please save yourself a headache and buy from anyone else. Greatbookdeals get well I don't have enough thumbs on my hands to give them a thumbs down.Would not recommend greatbookdeals to anyone.............!!!!!!

0316096199|4.0|I loved the book.  It was a little difficult to read the actual rape scene, especially knowing it actually happened. But watching the outcome of the story was satisfying and gratifying.
B002UPA4ZY|2.0|I was not as impressed with this one. I think it was the Christmas songs that I was not used to hearing from Andrea.  The children singing was different, nice ~ but not what I was thinking.  A lot of stage changes throughout that were kind of nice but just not real life feel, had more of a \\"staged\\", if you will, feel .  This video did not capture me like his others. If you really want an awesome video of Andrea I suggest \\"Under The Tuscan Sun\\" filmed in Tuscany.  Kenny G, Chris Botti, Ling Ling, and many more very tanlented artist.  The scenery is gorgeous the acoustics and stage are quite nice. Very Well done!

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this game for my family (we are all over 30) and we played many times over the Christmas break.

B0029LHX1W|1.0|This novel is a total disaster!  The premise of the plot is totally implausible and incredulous! That Stalin's Secret Police would allow an officer to investigate his own wife! Come on! The author must be snorting cocaine to allow such a gap in logic. I am amazed at the reviewers on the back cover of the book? How could they have read the same book that I did and reach such a radical difference in conclusions?  Were the just friends or friends of friends of the author? If you want top-notich writing about Stalin's era, you need go no further than the masterful Alan Furst's \\"Night Soldiers.\\" Forget this book unless you just want to suspend all reality in order to make it work.

B0026P3G12|5.0|In an age when so many performers rely more on theatrics than on their voices, Susan Boyle reminds us of the power in music delivered with subtlety and self-effacing elegance.  She gives the song space to work its own magic instead of pulling all focus to herself.  \\"Wild Horses\\" alone is worth the price of the album; it is likely the most lyrical, bittersweet ballad of a decade.
B0024RID60|5.0|This is the 4th time I've purchased this album starting with the original release so yeah I guess I like it (and those who \\"borrow\\" it from me really like it too). Early on the Stones were criticized for being derivative in their concept albums - trying to keep up with the Beatles or the latest trends. This album is simply, uniquely the Stones. All their influences are here but they've been fully Stonesified. This album is a seemingly effortless classic. Excellent!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I love this series!     Its on blu-ray so I was expecting to see a higher price...but definitely relieved that it was on sale for 40$...

B002GYVRRI|4.0|Great album! Marks the true origin of progressive rock's power trio (ask Rush). I think Fripp ended it because he could not see how it could be improved. A must to any Crimson fan.
B000059TEQ|5.0|The extras and comentary are decent. I got it because I like the movie, and used to have the VHS. The movie plot is your good old romance tearjerker. Got to admit the story is kind of timeless. Good movie either for date night or for  girls night inn.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|The difficulty of transferring the written word to the silver screen has been tackled and won, IMO, with this latest installment of the Harry Potter books. As befits the subject matter of this episode the film is darker and more somber and the colors reflect it.  Once again those making this epic series have done a good job of showing as much as possible on screen as movie goers rear ends will endure.
B000RGSOG4|5.0|I'm very satisfied with order, it cameqiute in time, the only thing our post office wasn't working well, so as present it came too late, but any way, rare thing in our country and amazon way best answer.
B0013FNC38|3.0|Not my favorite CD ever but definitely has a few really good songs. I'm Yours and Details in the Fabric are definitely worth a listen to.
0061689246|5.0|This happens to be one of my favorite movies ever.  I think it can be loved by nearly all ages and all types of people.  I loved all the actors, and I think Charlie Cox, who was little known before this movie will become a big star.  He has an absolutely great smile and great laughter.  This is something I hope to see more of in movies because I'm tired of the sour-looks that have seemingly become popular.  I also liked Mark Strong in this film, even though he wasn't a smiley person, but his character usually didn't call for him to be.  Seeing people like Rupert Everett in small supportive roles was also great.  And the scenery of Iceland, Scotland, Wales, and wild parts of England was such an incredible backdrop for this very fine film.  I very rarely write reviews, so you can be sure that this movie really made me go out of my way.[[ASIN:B000WZAE1I Stardust (Widescreen Edition)]][[ASIN:B000WZAE1I Stardust (Widescreen Edition)]]
B0035OTPEK|3.0|My review here pertains to the \\"bonus\\" tracks available on this Deluxe version vs. the regular release LP (where I've also written my main review).[[ASIN:B002RDGR2I In This Light And On This Evening]]<br /><br />Here's the skinny, in my opinion:<br /><br />1) At the time of this writing, the Deluxe version is actually cheaper than the standard version (!?) so you should buy the Deluxe.<br /><br />2) But ...should the price go up or exceed the cost of the standard album, I just don't think the Deluxe album is worth much extra dough for the additional songs. What I'm saying is while I'm a big fan of the Editors, I just wasn't terribly impressed with these additional tracks found on the Deluxe version.<br /><br />I definitely think you should buy some version of this album, just don't break the bank because this one has extra tracks.

I am so satisfied and I am going to continue to order the rest of the series.

B000ASATZ8|5.0|Tremors is one of those scary sci-fi movies with suspense that keeps you on the edge of your seat, at the same time making you laugh aloud with its tongue in cheek parody of the genre. It somehow manages to include bloody violence from the monsters, without terrorizing younger (12 and up) audiences. My 14-year-old grandson, and I, 50 years older than he, do a marathon Tremors night at least twice a year. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward excel in their portrayal of two cowboy-handymen who become heroes battling vicious and hungry underground monsters. Reba McIntyre captures perfectly the character of the supportive wife of a hard care survivalist. This is a must-see, must-have sci-fi monster movie!
0066620996|5.0|In this age of motivational speakers, leadership Gurus, and other hoopla artists, it is refreshing to read a study based on serious research that uncovers new insights into what can transform a good company into a great one.

B000A6T1KE|2.0|Star Trek Nemesis.  The movie that is reputed to have killed the franchise.  This movie has the lowest box office return of any Trek film made to date, even lower than that of Final Frontier.  However, I really don't think the movie is quite as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  I think people's dislike for this movie stems from the fact that Star Trek was just starting to get old.  And Nemesis came out around the same time that Voyager and Enterprise were on TV, and both those shows are reputed to be the worst of the five Trek shows.  Nemesis suffers from being cliched and familiar.  Some people would go so far as to say that they copied and pasted Wrath of Khan's plot for this movie.  I wouldn't go as far as that, but I do think that this movie is nothing new, and it's too similar to previous Trek movies.  It's not a bad movie, necessarily, but it's too predictable and borrows way too much from better movies.  But first and foremost, Nemesis is just a dumbed down, dumb action movie.  Like what some people accused First Contact of being?  This actually was.  Almost every event that takes place in the \\"plot\\" is just an excuse to have a chase scene or fight scene.  With that said, let's get to the actual review.    The movie opens up with some Romulan senators being killed by some green mist that turns them into something dead.  Then they die.  After this, we cut to the wedding ceremony of Troi and Riker.  I don't want to go into much detail concerning this scene, but it sucked.  Basically, they did their best to make all the characters look like idiots.  Worf being drunk, Data singing that stupid song.........I don't want to go into it.  After that, the crew of the Enterprise heads toward Betazoid to have a wedding ceremony there.  On the way, they happen upon a positronic energy signal coming from the Kolaren system, near the Romulan neutral zone.  Positronic signals only come from androids, so they decide to investigate.  They get on a new shuttle (what's wrongwith the transporters?) and fly down to the planet.  They find the android in scattered pieces on the planet surface.  As they are about to leave, a group of aliens attacks them.  A big chase scene ensues, and eventually our heroes escape.  Now here's the first example of why this is a dumb action movie.  That chase scene was decent, but what was it doing in the movie?  Who were the aliens?  Why did they want to kill Picard?  Did Shinzon tell them to kill Picard?  But if he needed Picard to do that operation thing, why would he want Picard dead?  Either way, this sequence is never mentioned again.  It was just there for a few thrills.  When assembled, the android looks exactly like Data.  It calls itself \\"B-4\\"  However, it appears far less advanced than Data.  It does not know anything about itself, and does not know how it came to be on the planet.    The Enterprise is then contacted by Admiral Kathryn Janeway, (why is she an admiral now?) who orders them to go to Romulus.  The Romulan government has been overthrown, and Romulus is now controlled by a Reman named Shinzon.  This is surprising, because the Remans are usually regarded as an inferior race by the Romulans.  They are usually used as slave labor, or cannon fodder.  When they meet with Shinzon, they discover that he is not a Reman, he is a human.  He is, in fact, a young clone of Picard.  Shinzon explains to Picard who he is.  And this part, I thought was pretty interesting.  Years ago, agents within the Romulan government cloned Picard, through a hair or skin sample.  They were going to kill the real Picard and put Shinzon in his place.  They would have had a spy within the federation.  But before they could execute the plan, a new government took over Romulus.  They decided to abandon the plan, and sent Shinzon to die in the mines.  One Reman took pity on him, and protected him.  This Reman would later become his viceroy.  In later years, when Romulus went to war, they needed Remans as footsoldiers.  Shinzon was drafted.  He ended up rising through the ranks to a powerful military position.  And now he has taken over Romulus.  This could have been a very interesting villian.  He's someone who's been through hell, and he is a very personal adversary for Picard.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just one long action scene.    It turns out that Shinzon is dying, and he needs Picard so he can do a blood transfusion.  He uses the B-4 (Shinzon's the one who placed the B-4 in the Kolaren system, but why did he scatter the pieces if he wanted Picard to find it?) to hack into the Enterprise computer for some stuff that is never really explained.  Picard is then transported aboard Shinzon's ship, the Scimitar, along with the B-4.  However, Data is able to beam onto the ship and take the B-4's place.  He frees Picard, in another cool but pointless action scene.  The Enterprise crew heads back to federation space, but are ambushed by the Scimitar while passing through the Mutara....I mean a Nebula which disrupts some of their instruments, including their communications.  Remember how I said they borrowed from other Trek movies?  The Scimitar and the Enterprise have a long space battle which takes up about the second half of the movie.  Instead of developing Shinzon further, they just have a big fight scene.  The Scimitar can fire it's weapons while cloaked, which is not ripping off Star Trek 6 in the slightest.  Enterprise is outgunned.  Shinzon sends a boarding party aboard the Enterprise to capture Picard for the surgery.  Leading the boarding party is his Viceroy.  The team is stopped by Enterprise security, and Riker kills the Viceroy.  With his attempt to capture Picard having failed, Shinzon decides to kill everyone on the Enterprise, and then do the same to earth.  The Scimitar is equipped with thalaron, the green mist thing from the beginning of the movie.  Picard decides to beam over to the Scimitar and stop him.  The transporters only have enough power for oneperson to go, so Picard decides to go.  Even though the last time he tried to physically take someone on, Malcolm Mcdowell beat the crap out of him.  When Data offers to go instead, Picard responds \\"this is something I have to do\\".  Right, `cause it has to be a long, dramatic action scene.  Picard beams over, and transporters are rendered inoperative.  Data decides to act, and jumps from the Enterprise to the Scimitar.  I'm serious.  I know he's an android and everything, but still.  That was at least a quarter mile.    Meanwhile, Picard has killed just about every Reman on Shinzon's ship.  He comes in all by himself, and is able to take out seven or eight Remans with his phaser.  The Remans must have graduated from the imperial stormtrooper school of marksmanship.  Once he's killed all the Remans, he and Shinzon have a fight.  Picard kills Shinzon, but has only seconds to dismantle the Thalaron weapon.  Data arrives just in time to save Picard.  Data is carrying a prototype for the ETU (emergency transport unit).  He slaps it on Picard, and it beams Picard back to the Enterprise.  Data shoots the Thalaron weapon, destroying it and the Scimitar.  The parallel with Wrath of Khan is so obvious I won't even bring it up.  But what was the point of the big shootout?  Why did Picard have to transport to the Enterprise?  Why not send someone tougher, like Data or Worf?  And if he really felt the need to go himself, why not take the ETU thing with him?  Because they needed to have a cool action scene.  The crew mourns the loss of Data.  Picard says goodbye to Riker and Troi, who are off to take command of the Titan.  In a conversation with the captured B-4, Picard realizes that Data had previously downloaded his katra, I mean neural net, into the B-4.  The movie ends with the thought that Spock, I mean Data, might be able to come back.    Star Trek Nemesis.  Not nearly the worst thing to carry the name Star Trek.  Not a bad plot, just a familiar one.  This movie borrows way too much from better movies.  Also, the movie had an interesting premise, but it sidelines that premise to make way for the dumb action scenes.  Let me rephrase that.  The action scenes were good, but unnecessary.  Instead of focusing on good action scenes, they should have focused more on crafting a good story.  They could have done that, they had the potential.  Instead, they just crafted a familiar story, which goes where way too many Trek movies have gone before.  It's a shame that this had to be such a failure, both critically and financially.  But the thing is, Star Trek had simply gotten old and predictable.  Fans needed something new.  And in 2009, we got it.  But that's a completely different review.

B001W63DX2|5.0|I recommend this movie even to people who don't like heavy metal. This is a film about six guys doing what they love, living outside the stereotypical debauched rockstar existence, and making millions of people quite happy with their rather gentle (for heavy metal) music.<br /><br />Whether you like heavy metal, or even rock music, it's part of life. It's how teenagers learn about the world, among other things, since their parents are busy working and our cultural centers like churches and traditions are on the wane. If you had to pick a heavy metal band to respect, Iron Maiden is it, and this documentary tells us with gradual anecdotes why this is true.<br /><br />Flying around the world in their own plane, piloted by their vocalist, the band attempt a mega-tour of 36 dates around the world, delighting audiences in Latin America, North America, Asia and Europe. Dunn and McFayden start their portrait of this band by showing us the typical rock star stuff: the thronging crowds, the complexity of setting up the stage, the giant amplifiers and security.<br /><br />Having introduced us to the ostensible, they go deeper, into the personalities of the band and what they are as people. The answer is that they're fairly mild-mannered musicians who are thoroughly enjoying making music, touring the world, playing golf and scuba diving, and in some cases, bringing their families along. They don't seem to care at all about upholding the rock star image that negative propaganda like \\"Dethklok\\" hopes to make us see everywhere heavy metal is mentioned.<br /><br />The point of this movie is that success isn't just about being money or being popular. It's about putting together songs people like with an image people find inspiring, and the origin of this mentality is in well-adjusted very normal people who simply love what they do and want to keep doing it. Whether the subject is lawyers, technical divers or rock stars, this subject brings calm to the mind as we all like hearing about success stories that involve the soul as well as the credit card.<br /><br />In addition to this insight into the character of one of heavy metal's longest-running and most wide-selling bands, \\"Flight 666\\" offers us expertly-edited live shots of the band that include most of a dozen of their most emblematic and enduring songs. It's not quite a concert video, but there's a concert video hidden within it, in addition to scenes of the band recording, playing for personal enjoyment, and talking about music.<br /><br />Not only would I let my kids see this, but I'd encourage them to see it -- this is a wholesome portrait of people who got to the top of the world by doing what they loved, doing it well, and not getting sidetracked into the politics of image. It's a great life-affirming documentary as a result.the soul as well as the credit card.

I you are seeking a light story with some interesting plot twists, a bit of fun, and a truly likable character, read this book. The love interest is a great character, too. I will be looking for more reads from Sophie Kinsella.

B00275EGWY|3.0|The Hurt Locker<br />Each year there is a movie that becomes the favorite of the critics and Hurt Lockers is this year's critical darling.<br />The movie is about the Explosive Ordinance Disposal squad and their routine in Iraq as they go about dismantling IEDS and defusing bombs from potential suicide bombers. This movie follows the three main characters around Iraq and the difficulties of performing well in an environment when one does not know who are the enemy and a friend; the movie was actually shot in Jordan and their daily life. Some are dying to get out of here but the main character Sgt James is absolutely devoted to his job. Note the scene towards the end when he is absolutely clueless in his civilian life while he struggles in the cereal aisle or his conversation with his son and his wife. The movie tries to offer us more glimpses in the life of the two other soldiers but only offers glimpses. Although their job is to keep others same, Sgt James in his zeal and bravado sometimes jeopardizes the life of his companions. Hurt Locker refers to the box kept by Sgt. James which has all the trigger mechanisms of the bombs he has defused.<br /><br />At times or rather the entire movie has the feel of a documentary but without a doubt the action scenes especially the fire fight and the several bomb defusing scenes have been shot extremely well. Congrats to the camera man and his assistants. The tension is nail biting and translated well to the screen. It shows us the service the men of the Army are doing for us and a standing ovation to these brave men. The movie deserves a look because it is probably one of the first movies that I have seen that does not politicize the movie; the other one was Taking Chance (read my review) There is a lot to recommend about the movie but characters have been half baked and the story line thin. A lot of big name stars are in this film Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pierce and Evangaline Lilly but blink and you miss them.<br />This year it is a classic battle of the exes i.e. James Cameroon and Kathyrn Bigelow, I place my bets on Avataar. I gave it three stars. 02/05/10of the exes i.e. James Cameroon and Kathyrn Bigelow, I place my bets on Avataar. I gave it three stars. 02/05/10

Set in the future it is the battle for domination by earthlings for the planet of Pandora for its precious metal Unobtanium. During its quest the humans find resistance from the natives the Navis. There is some story to the movie but you have heard it by now.<br />Movie making at its finest this is the result of a talented director, lots of imagination, the finest creative people and an unlimited CGI budget which pushes the envelope on 3D film making. For all those hold outs waiting for the DVD, here is my advice go to the movie theater, preferable the one with IMAX capabilities and watch this one. You won't be disappointed. 4 stars 01/07/10

0684135051|5.0|I love this book. I can't say it enough. For me, I picked it up when I really couldn't even knit, and immediately put it back down. It won't teach you how to knit, but then that's not it's purpose. EZ starts with the assumption that you can already cast on, knit, and execute a decrease. None of which are hard and can be found easily online. So...    It also probably will not be loved by those who love patterns. That's clear from other reviews. You HAVE to be a little bit flexible to appreciate this book. But to me, flexibility is the hallmark of creativity. If your happiest moments in life are reproducing a pattern so closely it looks like the picture on the front of the pamphlet, you won't understand the draw this book has. But if you want to be the master of your own knitting, this will be something you return to again and again. That's probably her fundamental purpose behind the book, that you be the master of your own knitting. That you aren't afraid to rip out, or drop a stitch down a few rows to fix something, because your knitting is your knitting and it will only do what you make it do. And that's why i love this book. It gave me confidence I didn't have before. It showed me I didn't need to be a designer or an expert to make my own stuff. And as others have said, it teaches you the absolutely essential skill of GUAGE and swatching. I tried a Zimmermann sweater without this... bad. Very bad. And I can't say she didn't warn me. :)    The pictures are not helpful, I'll admit. They're more for sake of visual interest I suppose than for instructional purposes. And yes, she's an uneven knitter, but if you read she admits that... and then says if you want a machine-even sweater, go buy a sweater. Otherwise, what's the point of handknitting? It shouldn't look store-bought anyway.    I was truly surprised how negative some of the reviews were... I have to say that obviously those people just didn't get what they were looking for... a pattern book. It's NOT a patternbook. It's a treatise on knitting. I found it inspirational and instructive.

0545123267|3.0|I'm a HUGE fan of the Twilight series and was hoping that this story might be on a similar interest level-namely a terrifically written love story. I did manage to read the book in just 3 sittings so it held my attention and proved to be a quick easy read. I found it to be rather shallow, a bit silly, and have no where near the quality of character and story development as Twilight. I would probably read a sequel when it comes out, but I definitely wouldn't spend money on it; I'd just borrow it from a library. There was so many times that the story was written in ways to convienence the author's progress in story telling rather then to develop story depth and meaning. The book was written for young teens and the 17 year old lead girl character does have sex with her werewolf boyfriend. The details are left out for the most part, but that is an important thing to know if parents are trying to determine if this is a story topic that they want their child to read about.

But after just seeing a couple eps I think that this is a really great series. It's style is reminiscent of 300, except there's a LOT of nudity/sex going on, expected of a premium cable show based in ancient Rome. There's some really explicit scenes going on... In the arena scenes there's a LOT of blood flying around...literally. I had to avert my eyes so many times cuz it was too much for me...     The acting/storyline so far is superb. I had never heard of Andy Whitfield before but he's amazing as Spartacus and the rest of the cast is really great as well. Super excited to see Lucy Lawless back on the small screen, except she doesn't get to kick a$$ in this one. And do I even need to mention all the hot gladiators?! =D
0670021652|1.0|I wanted to like this book, to hear the continuation of the story of Elizabeth Gilbert and Felipe committing to build their new life together in marriage and love. I wanted the answer to the \\"I wonder what happened to Felipe and Elizabeth?\\" question that I asked myself upon finishing Eat, Pray, Love. Unfortunately, that story is less than 5% of this book. The rest of the book (approx. 20%) is devoted to how other cultures view marriage and the remaining 75% is devoted to her endless questioning whether she can actually marry again. The personal anecdotes were the rare gems of the book that get buried in this research Gilbert felt she needed to do in order to answer her question of whether she can actually get married. Unfortunately, she fails to complete this connection, and the research dulls the stories. Ultimately, she and Felipe had to get married in order for them to live together in the U.S., so why the research? I get that she needed to help her understand whether she could remarry, but why go on for as many as pages as she did about it. How did the research help her reach the conclusion she could remarry? This connection also isn't completed.     Thankfully, I returned the book and checked it out from the library instead. Ps - the audiobook isn't any better.

0345337581|3.0|In the brilliant BBC series on the human brain, there's a section on competitive memorizers, individuals who can remember the exact sequence for five decks of cards.  Here's how they do it.  The individual will take a long slow stroll in a city, and commit to memory that route (which is not hard, given how a city route will activate all the human senses).  Then that individual will assign a ridiculous cartoon character to each card (a jack of clubs may be a teddy bear doing jumping jacks), and in memorizing the sequence of five decks mentally assign a cartoon character a sequential place on that route.  In this way, the individual constructs a visual narrative that permits him to memorize the sequence of five decks of cards.    This is all very impressive, but unfortunately the utility of such a trick is limited -- to basically memorizing the sequence of playing cards in a deck.  This is also the same memory trick that features prominently in \\"The Memory Book\\" by Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas.  They also teach you how to memorize people's names (exaggerate a feature of someone's face and associate it with a ridiculous visualization of that person's name), as well as how to memorize long sequences of numbers.    As Mr. Lorayne and Mr. Lucas point out constantly, human beings have been doing impressive feats of memorization for a long time.  Homer's \\"The Illiad\\" and \\"The Odyssey\\" were both passed on from one generation to the next orally.  Greek and Roman orators are forced to commit long speeches to memory.  Even today, students in certain societies must memorize the Talmud and the Koran. So how do they do it?  Well, not by following the suggestions of Mr. Lorayne and Mr. Lucas.      First, these classics are written in a way that lends itself to memorization.  Homer's \\"The Illiad\\" is a visual narrative that rhymes (which permits memorization) and is inundated with rhetorical devices.  One good reason for Shakespeare to write all his plays in iambic pentameter was that that way the actors could memorize their lines (there were no scripts in Shakespeare's day).      Another is that the people who did the memorization were very intelligent individuals.  In other words, the classic mistake that Mr. Lorayne and Mr. Lucas make is to assume that memory is a stand alone feature in the human brain.  It is not -- and in fact, like the strength of the abdomen can be a reflection of a person's general fitness so is memory a testament to the person's overall intelligence.  Possessing general fitness, co-ordination, balance all augment a person's memory as well as intelligence.  So does reading and conversation, play and exploration.      More technically, memorization tricks are not limited to the association and visualization techniques that the authors continually emphasize.  How about categorization and patterning?  A good mind does categorization and patterning automatically, but they can and should be taught as well.

B00005JKHP|4.0|First things first, I wasn't a Star Trek fan at all prior to watching this film. I've never seen an original series episode ever! But the characters are so iconic, I felt like I had. Some of the negative aspects of the film are correct. There are scenes where it seemed like either the director or the special effects crew were amazed at the special effects work that the normal shots of a space ship which would normally last about 30 seconds (if even that) in movies now-a-days last for 5 minutes! I'm not kidding. A long 5 minutes of the crew reacting to psychedelic looking clouds! Spock's 5 minute space-walk! Oh my! I was tempted to push the forward button but I stuck with it. And yes, some of the special effects look awesome and others look horrible! But with that aside, I really enjoyed the film. William Shatner definately steals the movie and according to George Takei he literally did that behind scenes, stealing peoples scenes and close-ups. But being a non-star trek fan, I really enjoyed the film. Just be prepared for those long drawn out scenes and enjoy the 2001 ripoff shots....!
B002MW50KO|5.0|This is mature Bob Dylan; I particularly am grateful he recorded \\"Little Drummer Boy\\".  Most of the songs were excellent just a few were out of my genre (not a problem).  Bob  sang a bit \\"huskily\\" at times and I prefer when he uses his natural voice, however, he has more than earned the right to present what suits him.  I have followed him since the 60's and many of his songs through the years have added a richness to my life.  I also appreciated that the purchase price was donated to Feeding America.  To me Bob is a humanitarian, singer, song-writter and performer beyond compare.  This DVD is a keeper.  [[ASIN:0825637309 Bob Dylan - Christmas in the Heart (Piano/Vocal/Guitar Artist Songbook)]]

Here's hoping that there will not be a rerelease with even more features, but unfortunately you never really know.
B002SJIO54|5.0|Definitely rated R for a reason--lots of gore, swearing, puking, etc.    Anyway, it's definitely not the pure visual candy that Avatar was, but the story is much, much better.  The characters are very intriguing and complex, and the cinematography is quite creative with wicked action scenes and special effects that deserve a respectful salute.      I compare it to Avatar because it follows a similar theme: the humans, not the aliens, are the oppressors.  District 9 did it first, and, I must say, better--instead of paying lip service to every cliché in the book, it threw them on the floor and stomped on them thoroughly.  The main character (note I didn't say hero because he's far from it), Wikus van der Mewe, is one of the most human and believable characters I've ever seen in a film (which is, if you watch the movie, incredibly ironic). I felt genuine sympathy for the prawns (the aliens), and actually liked them a lot more than most of the humans, despite their chitinous, buggy exterior.      Unlike Avatar, District 9 makes no effort to be pretty; in fact, I'd say it makes a point of showing the genuine ugliness of the situation.  I also liked how the story was told: the film starts out as if it were a documentary, using interviews and news clips, then shifts slowly into more traditional storytelling so seamlessly that the whole thing feels real.  Combine that with the aforementioned believable characters and in-your-face, nitty-gritty visuals, and you get a movie that is both incredibly epic and insanely close to reality.    As much as I love it, it's not for everyone.  District 9 is not a feel-good, escapist adventure, and some scenes are honestly brutal and gut-wrenching.  In my opinion, the freakin' sweet fight scenes (pig-throwing for the win) and the adorable baby prawn (ZOMG SO CUTE) make up for that, but it might not cut it for you.  Rent it first--you won't know for sure until you watch it.    \\"Remember, a smile is always cheaper than a bullet!\\"
B001C4CI8U|5.0|This is the first season of a Sci-Fi TV series on the FOX network that I was late to discover. If you are a fan of X-Files you will most likely be entertained by this. It is similar but has a different twist and the most charming characters and more of the ick and terror and slightly more of the supernatural phenomena to explain the bad science.<br />I was sad to see X-Files end as I was sad to come to the conclusion of this first season set. It's worth obtaining this set of DVDs just to see the special features and interviews.<br />It's a 7 disk set with 3 episodes with special features on each except #1 which has the pilot (first aired 9/9/08) and special features. Enjoy!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatural and Dexter are my favorite TV shows. The first season of Supernatural shows you the premise of what the story is going to be: two brothers whose mother was killed by a demon and whose father became a hunter of the evil teamed-up again after a few years of trying to live a 'normal' life because dad is missing. What I really like about this show is that the stories are well developed and you actually learn about different spirits from diverse mithologies (Christian, Eastern, Native American, Indian, etc.). It's not just a stranger mix.<br /><br />J
B00338QENI|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a multi-layered work of history, ethics and, to some extent autobiography.  The author, Rebecca Skloot not only resurrects Ms. Lacks from a dehumanizing anonymity (being referred merely as \\"Hela\\" or worse as \\"Helen Lane\\") but she also restores a measure of dignity to the Lacks family who spent decades knowing little of the astonishing contributions made by the cells that were taken, without consent (an important issue in this work for those contemplating buying it), from Mrs. Lacks before her death from cervical cancer in 1951.  Although this is Ms Skloot's first book, she does a very fine job of juggling the complex, intertwining stories of Mrs Lacks, her children, science (cell lines, DNA, genetics, matters relating to consent for tissue \\"donation\\") and her own efforts to understand a woman she first met vicariously in a college biology class. Not wanting to be a plot spoiler, I end by saying only that I hope Mrs. Lacks family has received a measure of peace, Henrietta will receive her rightful place in history and that the scholarship fund mentioned by Ms. Skloot can indeed be set up for the Lacks family.  Of Ms. Skloot, I hope we will be reading more of her works in the future.
B000F2O4MI|1.0|I gave 1 star not because the movie was bad (great movie) but because I think this movie is a copy of a copy. Packaging cheap and the image for the movie on the cd just didn't seem right, not professionally done.
B000025JMP|5.0|While the 68 special,Elvis On Tour,and Aloha were all excellent,this one shows a very confident,dedicated singer at the top of his game.It was clear that Elvis was enjoying himself and was very dedicated to learning new material and performing with perfection.Physically,mentally,and vocally he had never been better.I am sure that this period is the way he would want to be remembered.He and the band were having fun while delivering the goods and Elvis was in control.
B00026WUAU|5.0|My wife thinks I'm nuts (I'm sure she is correct), but I've been spending many hours compiling a 10 cd Dylan mix of almost 180 songs spanning his whole career. The biggest issue is with what to exclude! While many albums were naturals to be heavily represented, I initially had just a few tunes from Street Legal. Going back and judging the cuts one by one, it became almost impossible to exclude any of them. While BOTT and Desire set a very high standard, this cd is very consistant and tuneful. I give this five stars in comparison to the average album and artist. If 7 or 8 dylan albums are stronger, that is just the ultimate tribute to this artist. Listen and enjoy.
B002SJIO4A|3.0|I can't rate the movie, why? simply because I didn't watch it, is quite simple, in the details section it announces:<br /><br />Language: English.<br />Subtitles: Cantonese, English, French, Korean, Spanish.<br /><br />Well at least the DVD Amazon sent to me in the end of 2009, it has only English and French Language tracks and subtitles, moreover, the DVD box post it very clear:<br /><br />Language: English, French5.1 (Dolby Digital), English Audio Description Track<br />Subtitles: English, French.<br /><br />This very stupid because the data is completely incorrect, I prefer when they only place \\"English\\" with no further details.<br />Finally I just drop it to the garbage because return an item is impossible from where I live (Spain) because the cheaper standard mail (with tracking package) charge me close to $10.00 (6.90 ) for a DVD case.

6305648522|5.0|After I watched the movie, I knew I wanted  to order it for my personal DVD library.  Wonderful storyline...a classic!
B0034JKZ86|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie, as it has really bothered me that Disney has not had an African-American princess -- it's positively shameful -- and I was excited about the hand-drawn nature of the movie. I also thought the music was going to be wonderful as the film is set in New Orleans.<br /><br />Well, what a disappointment. I was hoping for a spoonful of magical Disney sugar on par with \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" or \\"The Little Mermaid\\". What I got was a dried-up packet of NutraSweet.<br /><br />Meticulous animation cannot save a cold story with no emotion or soul. As other posters have remarked, the writing for this film is on par with a Saturday morning cartoon. There's no flash, dash, or cleverness; no laugh-out-loud moments or times you want to cry. It's all been done before, and better ... the movie is full of worn-out cliches.<br /><br />There's no plot to speak of, just aimless wondering around. Where is the excitement of mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and personalities we felt in the bayou of \\"The Rescuers\\"? The animation is Hallmark-card perfect (too perfect), and the characters are boring, underdeveloped, and goody-goody. Dr. Facilier, the character everyone says is so thrilling, overacts so badly I felt like I was watching an avatar in a cheap video game. The director should have told him to add some nuance. Poor Tiana is a cardboard cutout on par with a character you'd find on a box of cereal. Where is the soul we saw in Belle, Arial, and even Meg from \\"Hercules\\"?<br /><br />The story itself is full of holes that you could drive Cinderella's carriage through -- for example, at the end of the movie, a major plot point revolves around someone inexplicably failing to kiss a frog before a clock chimes -- it makes no sense. She had the frog right in her hand -- huh? And the clock -- come on. You can never top the clock in \\"Cinderella\\", so why in the world make a half-baked attempt to even try?<br /><br />I am disturbed that we do not see much of Tiana as Tiana. It is nonsensical that she is a frog for most of the movie -- I have my suspicions that Disney was afraid that having an African-American face on the screen was just too daring, so they made her into a frog for almost the whole movie. Someone pinch me, is it 2010 or 1810? This character and the little girls who came to see her deserved better.<br /><br />The music ... don't get me started. Where were the big hits that we heard in movies like \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Sleeping Beauty\\"? Why couldn't they give us magnificent music like in \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\"? Is this pap the best the very highly-paid Disney people could command? I could write better songs beeping the buttons on my cell phone.<br /><br />This movie is not only soulless, it's a crying shame. This is not what Disney is all about. If only the Blue Fairy could swoop down and wave her magic wand and give this cartoon a soul. She brought Pinocchio to life but she would not be able to do a thing with this dud.he movie -- I have my suspicions that Disney was afraid that having an African-American face on the screen was just too daring, so they made her into a frog for almost the whole movie.

B00004RJ71|5.0|Jimmy Santiago Baca wrote the screenplay-----some of the information came from his award winning book A PLACE TO STAND.  This film actually had scenes filmed in San Quentin with only a few actors and many inmates.  The realism displayed by award winning director Taylor Hackford is sobering.  Benjamin Bratt seen early in his career does an outstanding job.   This film follows 3 brothers who make different choices with different results that impact their lives forever.

B001EN71DG|5.0|Star Wars has one of the largest fan bases of any Hollywood phenomenon out there, so it comes as no surprise that they break off into little cliques to decide how its legacy should live on. There are those who claim that nothing should be done to the original since that's what they fell in love with, and there are those who want to be selective about the updating done to them, and then there are those who want them to be retconned entirely so that they fit the prequels more. George Lucas can't win.    I was born in '87, but my first exposure to Star Wars was in fact the original film. Personally, I have found all of the enhancements to be enjoyable (well, okay, Han shot first, but aside from that...), and expect there to be many more enhancements made in my lifetime because Lucas is an artist who will never be completely happy with his work, partly due to the fans incessant whining. People will always find something wrong with these movies.    I enjoy Star Wars in all its forms, and look forward to future updates from Lucasfilms. 5 out of 5.
0545123267|3.0|Shiver is about a girl named Grace who was attacked by wolves when she was young. As she lay dying one of the wolves came to her rescue. Ever since then she has treated that particular wolf as a distant but well-loved pet. But unbeknownst to Grace, her wolf is really a boy named Sam--the temperature is what causes Sam to change so he spends his summers a human and his winters as a wolf.    So first off, I loved the entire concept of Shiver. I don't normally seek out romance novels but I can't stay away from a good fantasy concept. (That, and the cover is gorgeous. Look at this--I have never seen more beautiful packaging.)     Despite the enjoyable original take on werewolves I had a lot of issues with this novel. It wasn't the kind of book I could devour in one sitting; I had to keep setting it down and coming back to it.     So, the thing that bothered me most was Grace. Not Grace in general, since I liked her overall, but some of her reactions were just not right. Sam is shot as wolf and he turns back into a human on her front porch. She takes him to the hospital. And then he's sleeping in her bed and they're in love? I was like, \\"Wait--back up.\\" Along the way, Sam gives her the gist of his werewolf-in-winter, human-in-summer background and she is fine with this. Personally, I would have a million and one questions and I would want an essay-style answer for each of them before I could even begin to rationalize this kind of situation. And I believe that this would be the normal human being reaction, right? Wouldn't you at least want to know a bit more about the guy before letting him sleep in your bed? With you in it?    Speaking of Grace's irrational reactions I just have a small nitpick that might be a mildly spoilery nitpick. So if you don't want to the mild spoilers, skip to the next paragraph. About halfway through the book there is a fade-to-black sex scene. The morning after the sex took place, Sam asked Grace if she slept with him to get back at her parents. Understandably, Grace gets angry. But she doesn't get angry because he's implying that she's the kind of girl that would sleep with someone for revenge. No, she gets mad because he has such poor self-esteem that he wouldn't think she would have sex with him just because she likes him. Would anyone else get mad because of the former rather than the latter or am I alone on this?    Anyway, that aside, Grace and Sam as a couple was cheesy. I am not equipped to handle cheesy. So I might be biased in saying that I found the relationship between the main characters to be boring. I did a lot of skimming when it was just the two of them being lovey-dovey together. But in my defense, that's really all they did was moon over each other. There really wasn't any relationship conflict save for the one mentioned above. In fact, most of the middle of the book was just flat for me. There were too many stretches that were devoid of any real action.     I'm not going to get into a deep discussion about the ending since I don't want to spoil, but the last forty pages or so, while not exactly action-packed, were probably the best. The resolution felt a little rushed and there was some suspension of disbelief. But I added a star for the last ten or so chapters.     Now that the whining part is over, time for the things that I did like:     Maggie Stiefvater's prose is, to put it simply, awesome. It was made of imagery, imagery, imagery. I could see what Grace was seeing and feel how Grace was feeling. If I were rating on the writing alone this would probably earn itself five stars.     I also liked the characters for the most part. My favorite character was Isabel, though I can't give a justifiable reason as to why other than the fact that I liked reading about her. I hope she gets a big part in Linger.     If you're a YA paranormal romance fan, rush out and buy Shiver right now. It will have a place on your favorites shelf, I guarantee it.

In the other hand, if we stop the former way of producing food, and we do it how we used to do it in 1950's we can only feed 1/3 of the human population, i can't see 4 billion people dying..try to change the way YOU eat don't bother other people, because if you don't know what is hunger, disease or starvation keep you opinions to yourself...

B0025KVLTW|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Among The Beatles' late 60's string of classic albums, \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" often gets lost behind \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" \\"The White Album,\\" and \\"Abbey Road.\\"  That is a shame, because for my money, this album trails only \\"Abbey Road\\" of all the other ones mentioned for sheer brilliance.<br /><br />Every element of the sound of The Beatles is here, from the pleasantly experimental \\"Flying,\\" to the daringly old-fashioned \\"Your Mother Should Know.\\"  The latter song is extremely catchy and entertaining while also being instructive material on the music of artists like Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett.  I suspect that this song began to make some closet Beatles fans out of the fabled \\"Older Generation\\" of the time.  Additionally, the band treats the listener to the brilliant \\"I Am the Walrus.\\"  Lastly, the title track is an odd combination of whimsicality and urgency that is an appropriate entry to such a varied album.<br /><br />Also featuring solid songs like \\"Penny Lane,\\" \\"The Fool on the Hill\\" and the anthemic \\"All You Need Is Love,\\" \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" is an invaluable piece of The Beatles' musical lore.
0316044938|2.0|Well, what can I say?  I enjoyed the first half of this book, but hated the second half.  The 1st half was interesting, and almost believable.  It doesn't have to be exactly factual - it just has to be believable.  But the second half was slow, slow, slow... and the ending??  Well, I won't give it away, but it felt like I was reading a supernatural mills & boon!!  It was TERRIBLE!!  Completely unbelievable, ridiculous, and wrapped up in too neat a little package for me at the end.  Two stars for the 1st half, but nothing for the second.  Don't waste your time or your money, or you'll literally be rolling your eyes at the end just like I was.

B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I purchased \\"This Is It\\" in November 2009; obviously before it was released.  My anticipation and anxiety was definitely fulfilled when I received and watched the video with my spouse.  The movie is excellent.  It brings out so many things about Michael Jackson, a person we thought we knew everything about; yet, there were many special, extraordinary positive, things that we did not know - i.e. his feeling and concern for people, environment, community, brother/sisterhood.   The music was great, as expected.  Learning more of the remarkable talent and genius of Michael is what made the production remarkable.
B002OB9KR2|3.0|It's not that the CD is bad, it's that it is just not that good. The first two Foreigner albums were classics (\\"Foreigner\\" and \\"Double Vision\\"). Ian McDonald and the gang put together two truly great albums, great vocals and instrumentals. This CD is like late stage Foreigner. The new vocalist is great and the playing is good but the song writing is nothing special. When I was young, we used to refer to songs of this type as \\"AM\\" music. As Mick Jones has matured, I anticipated that his song writing would also and expected the band to produce another classic. Unfortunately, it has not. If you like songs from the Foreigner catalog like \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\" or \\"I Want to Know What Love is\\", then you will like this CD. If you prefer tunes like \\"the Damage is Done\\", \\"Long, Long Way From Home\\", \\"Starrider\\", and \\"Blue Morning, Blue Day\\", then I think you will hear this CD as I do.

Jonathan RM is very good, Sam Neal, is also very good as the sometimes very conniving character. A little bit of poetic licence is used as to the historic detail, but if not an actual history lesson, you get a very entertaining rendition of the era.

0385341008|5.0|This charming book, which affords a window on London and Guernsey in 1946, has everything going for it, beginning with a knock-out title. Protagonist Juliet Ashton, an author with writer's block and other problems, begins receiving delightfully intriguing letters from members of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. She travels to Guernsey to meet these islanders and encounters an assortment of eccentric yet down-to-earth characters who cope with the sufferings of war and with their own personal relationships in ways that are practical, dramatic, hair-raising, and unstintedly hilarious - except for one tragic episode which reminds us not all horrors of WWII ended in anything except devastation. This truly 5-star  book has a prominent place on a bedside table in my guest room and does not fail to elicit praise from its readers.

The film manages interesting historic commentary as well as fleshing out a strong story. The subject matter is life and the film is worth watching for its deep insights on culture and history.
B0009P42S2|5.0|Very well presented topic in an animated format. Thought provoking and a very strong call for a return to simpler times.  Would recommend seeing this movie to more than \\"Steampunk\\" audiences.

The author who had written the book based on this movie, Fannie Flagg, even made a cameo appearance as the teacher - and did an awesome job on the screenplay which made this film true to the book. This is a wonderful film that is made to be enjoyed.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I LOVE this show. I don't get the premium cable channels so I have to get the DVD's. I saw this season using Netflix because I didn't want to buy a whole season of some weird serial killer show I might not like. If that's your concern, have no fear. You WILL like Dexter! The show AND the character. I won't spoil the show for you so you can read on. Dexter's dad is a cop. He realized Dex had a problem, so taught him how not to get caught and taught him ethics. Dexter only kills bad guys! Oh, did I mention his sister is a cop and has no idea about him? AND Dexter works for the police as a forensics expert! This is a fantastic show. You hear Dexter's thoughts and you love the guy! You keep wondering, what made him like this, what made him like this? And then you find out!!!!! But I'm not gonna tell you that. The same day I finished watching this season on Netflix I went out and bought the DVD set for both Season one and two. The day season three was released I had that, too. I'm on pins and needles waiting for Season four. I'm actually considering getting Showtime. Dexter is THAT good!
B000CCD0HQ|4.0|This review refers to the 2006 release (Warner Bros. R2 78966):  Yes, the original mix and drum sound is back on this version as noted in many fine reviews here, but, sadly, as noted in the earlier review \\"Disappointed by a mastering error, October 17, 2009\\" by \\"CrCardFan\\" he IS correct that \\"There's an error in \\"LaGrange\\" at 2:22: ... about 1/4 second or 1-2 beats of Frank Beard's [drum] fill has been deleted. Most may not notice it, but being a drummer and having the song committed to memory, this error sticks out like a sore thumb ...\\" - and you don't have to be a drummer to notice it (assuming you have listened to the original from the days of vinyl and free form FM radio enough to have it burned into memory - sounds like 2 full beats are gone to me). Once you do notice it, it will bug you each time that you hear it.    Unfortunately, if you go back to the \\"Greatest Hits\\" version of La Grange, you are back to the newer remix with the echoey drums, etc.  A real shame that this has to happen on the signature song, and another good case for keeping both your vinyl collection and turntable in good shape.  Overall, this is still the best version of the \\"Tres Hombres\\" album on cd, but it seems unlikely that this glitch will be fixed going forward.  Yes, you can live with it and its not horrible, but is it really too much to ask for these \\"remasters\\" to be at least as good (or complete) as the originals?  UPDATE: I did finally get a copy of the old release of \\"The Best Of ZZ Top\\" that was also referenced in the review by CrCardFan\\" noted above, and, as he said, the version of \\"La Grange\\" on that disc does NOT have the missing beats at 2:22 (and also does not have the new echoey drums - it is the original sound, and completely intact).  That disc is Warner Bros. 3273-2 and this appears to be it on Amazon here: [[ASIN:B000002KJW Best of Zz Top]].  This appears to be the first release of that disc (probably around 1989-1990, it is labelled as c1977 London Records, which is the LP release date), not sure about later versions of it (There is a 2004 repackage version on Rhino). At the time of this writing, you can add this for just a little above the standard cost of the shipping from 3rd party vendors.

B001684L0A|5.0|This is one of the best made movies in both a historical and cinematic way. I saw it on tv first, but with the Blu-ray , it jumps off the screen. You feel that you are experiencing the times, both good and bad.Paul Giamatti is the best John Adams ever. One of the few movies that you wish it wouldn't end
0061537969|5.0|this is one of the greatest stories I have read, it stirs up every emotion, but mostly joy. This is a wonderful book.
B00197YZ7M|5.0|This is an excellent interpretation of an equally excellent book. It deserves the raves and awards it received when it first came out, for story line, as well as all aspects of the production.  The DVD was fairly priced, came in excellent condition, and promptly, so the transaction was very satisfying.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I'll keep it short, an 18 minutes track (anesthetize) that takes you places, that alone is worth the money, the rest is just gravy. Kudos to Steve and the band.
0439813786|5.0|My 10 yr old took this book out of her school's library and I was instantly intrigued by it tot he point I had to buy a copy of it right away. Though 556 pages, I read it over about 3 or 4 hours? Just a beautiful book. Love the illustrations and how they help to tell the story. It is not your average picture book. Just such a great story that is so vividly told by Mr. Selznick in both word and pictures.    I'm thrilled to hear that \\"Martin Scorsese bought the screen rights to the book in 2007, John Logan wrote the script, and talks are being held with both Sony and Paramount to take on the distribution rights.Chris Wedge was going to direct the film for Warner Bros with Johnny Depp's production house Infinitum Nihil.\\"    I very much look forward to seeing this wonderful book brought to the big screen.

B000WGWQG8|4.0|\\"John Adams\\" is a fine mini-series, with high production values and faithful adherence to what is known about the history of the period.  It consists of seven episodes lasting a total of 501 minutes.  Paul Giamatti in the role of John Adams does a superb job of capturing the complexities, strengths, and weaknesses of this Founding Father.  Laura Linney is outstanding in the role of John's wife Abigail.    However, in spite of the length of more than eight hours, the story is so complex that a viewer who has not read David McCullough's fine history entitled \\"John Adams\\" on which the series is based may encounter some confusion as events transition from Boston to Philadelphia to France to Holland, etc.    As good as this series is--and you will not go wrong by purchasing it--I suggest that you consider an older mini-series entitled \\"The Adams Chronicles\\" instead.  Released in 1976, \\"The Adams Chronicles\\" has 13 episodes and lasts a whopping 13 hours, but the extra length allows it to better explain the \\"whats and whys\\" of the events as they unfold.  Because it is an older production, the sound is not as good, but the history is far more complete.
B0029LHW68|2.0|I have been a giant fan of Jared Leto and 30 seconds to mars for quite some time, i waited so long for this CD, i was so excited about it but...  As many have said, and i'll state again.. they ruined what could have been an AMAZING CD with a bunch of nonsense. The children choirs, the song with kanye west (or however you spell the morons name) .... granted, this is just an opinion from one person, my opinion. I'm not sure exactly what they were attempting to do with this CD, but i absolutely hate it, and was utterly disappointed.  On a side not.. kings and queens, and this is war were okay songs, and Closer to the edge is the only song worth listening to continuously in my opinion. It has a wonderful, catchy chorus.. i just wish they had released an album, not what seems to me a waste of time and what, 3 or 4 years since their last release?  Sighhhhh.... FAIL.

0805091742|4.0|This is a smoothly written book be that builds on two basic premises. The first is that we we've learned the best way to do many things, but we often fail to do them well because of our human limitations.<br /><br />To illustrate this, Gawande tells several stories. The most compelling and powerful is the story of a young Swiss girl who was trapped beneath the ice in a pond. She was under water so long that, as recently as a couple of dozen years ago, that would have been it. Her body would have been retrieved from under the ice and she would have been pronounced dead.<br /><br />Not so today. The girl is transported to a hospital where she is brought back to life. That's a miracle, but as Gawande points out it's also a story of a very complex mission. To get the result<br /><br />Scores of people<br />Needed to perform thousands of procedures<br />Correctly<br />In the right sequence<br />And with the right timing.<br /><br />If any of the procedures was omitted or done incorrectly or out of order or too early or late, the result would have been different. We know a lot. Putting it to work can be tough.<br /><br />The second premise is that simple checklists are the way to make human beings able to master the complexity. Indeed, the subtitle for the book is \\"How to get things done right.\\"<br /><br />Gawande first uses the illustration of Peter Pronovost and his simple checklist for a single medical procedure. The results were almost miraculous. When the checklist was tested in Michigan, infections declined by two thirds almost immediately.<br /><br />That sets the stage for chapter 2, \\"The Checklist.\\" Gawande opens with the story of the Boeing Model 299. Originally the plane was \\"too complex for one person to fly.\\" But then, some pilots came up with the idea of using a checklist as a memory aid to make sure that everything necessary to prepare to fly this multi-engine airplane got done. Checklists are the secret to getting complex tasks done well.<br /><br />Chapter 3, \\"The End of the Master Builder,\\" does two things. It compares the situation in medicine today to the situation in the construction industry when buildings became too complex for one person to know, remember, and evaluate all the details. Gawande describes the use of checklists in construction to assure that steps are complete and to deal with exceptions, issues and problems.<br /><br />Chapters 4 and 5 return to the introduction of surgical and related checklists in medicine. Gawande describes the difficulties of putting an effective checklist together.<br /><br />That leads to chapter 6, \\"The Checklist Factory\\" which brings us around again to aviation checklists. In this case the author visits the part of the Boeing Corporation that develops, tests, and revises checklists for all Boeing aircraft.<br /><br />Chapters 7 and 9, primarily about medical checklists bracket a chapter on \\"The Hero in the Age of Checklists.\\" There, Gawande uses the story of flight 1549's \\"Miracle on the Hudson\\" to make his case for checklists as guides for actions and sources of teamwork.<br /><br />Make no mistake. Gawande is writing this as a physician and as a call for increased use of checklists in the practice of medicine. That is a noble cause, but it may not what you're looking for from the book. And it leads to several problems.<br /><br />The first problem, unless you're in the medical field, is that you will have to do a bit of work to define for yourself how what Gawande tells us relates to what you do every day. If you want to cut right to the chase, read chapters 2, 3, and 6. There's also a discussion of checklists in venture capital investing in chapter 7. They're worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Another problem is that, for Gawande, everything becomes a checklist. Checklists are checklists, of course. So are To Do lists. So are protocols. So are recipes. So are information gathering forms. If that bothers you, skip this book.<br /><br />Since his purpose is to encourage the use of checklists in medicine, the checklist becomes the hero. One instance is in his telling of Wal-Mart's response to Hurricane Katrina.<br /><br />Wal-Mart authorized its store managers to do whatever they could to help people. Many did simply amazing things. Wal-Mart's logistical team got supplies into the area while FEMA was still in the press conference stage. That's great, but I'm still scratching my head trying to understand what that all had to do with checklists.<br /><br />The story of US Airways flight 1549 and the \\"Miracle on the Hudson,\\" is told in the same way. Checklists are the hero. But that position doesn't stand scrutiny.<br /><br />There were several things that contributed to the miracle. One was the professionalism and calm of the entire flight crew, as Captain Sullenberger, who got almost all the media credit hastened to point out again and again and again.<br /><br />There were also Sullenberger's flight skills. There was the technology that helped him execute the perfect glide slope. And there was a bit of luck. Checklists were part of the story, but hardly the hero.<br /><br />This is a superbly written book. Dr. Gawande is an excellent storyteller. He also uses his own learning as a kind of frame story to introduce other stories. You can enjoy it as a way to stimulate your thinking in an enjoyable way.<br /><br />But, unlike Gawande's other books, this one takes some work to draw out the practical material and apply it in your own world. If that's your main goal for reading the book, you can skip right to the more useful chapters.to Hurricane Katrina.

0307269981|4.0|Started out great and had a fast paced couldn't put it down ending but it moved slowly in the middle.  Larsson described the same situation from different character's perspectives and I found it a bit repetitive.  Seemed like he was trying to add 100 pages to the book.  It was a good story and I really like Lisbeth Salander.  I'll miss her and be happy to be hanging out with her again when I read the final book in Larsson's trilogy.

0743277708|2.0|I am not the type of person to give up.  If I pay my money, I want to get my money's worth.  This book is really boring, but since there was no bad language or sex, I didn't have any excuse for not trying to get through it.  After about 6 months of forcing myself to read it, after page 300 I finally decided to skim it.  Then I skipped to the epilogue.      Everyone else loves this book.  Maybe there is something wrong with me.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|I couldn't wait to get my hands on the sixth installment as soon as I saw it on Amazon! Overall, I just felt like the bonus features were lacking something. The preview of the seventh movie was seriously lacking - and character interviews were pretty dumb. The short feature following JK Rowling was the only aspect I found appealing at all. Bottom line - buy the DVD for the awesome movie (not its bonus features)

B002YICN74|3.0|This is a good start for Nick Jonas's solo career but lacks knock-out tunes beyond the title track.  Many have the same feel about them--laid back singing, mellow arrangements, introspective lyrics to the point of sometimes not making sense. It seems that this was produced quickly with minimal background instruments, which causes songs like \\"Vesper's Goodbye\\" to suffer without orchestration.      He's being compared to John Mayer but most of Nick's songs have a moral or spiritual theme to them, and he comes across as a young Michael W. Smith. He should be praised for trying to communicate a faith message. But if Nick would not insist on only performing his own songs he would grow more as an artist.  There just aren't enough good songs on this CD to give it much more than 3 and 1/2 stars or the \\"C\\" that some critics are grading it.
B001AQT0UY|5.0|\\"Gremlins\\" is one of the great guilty pleasures of motion pictures. It's an absolute classic, tremendous fun every time you watch it. As one reviewer said, it's \\"a hoot\\".<br /><br />Though \\"Gremlins\\" comes across as a perverse take on the holiday cheer of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" (the dis-connection is explicitly made within the film), one cannot overlook \\"Forbidden Planet\\". Just as the \\"Great Machine\\" allowed the Krells' inner demons to take physical form, so are the gremlins a representation of our normally suppressed murderous impulses. Otherwise, why would Billy Peltzer * be so careless about the rules?<br /><br />This is not as much of an interpretive stretch as it seems. Most of the scenes in which the \\"bad\\" or unlikeable characters are punished or killed were removed from the final cut. Mrs. Deagle (the film's equivalent of Old Man Potter) is murdered in a grotesquely comic manner, but the scene which \\"justifies\\" her offing (she's forcing the bank to foreclose properties on which a chemical plant will be built) was deleted. (Though the director's desire to keep the film moving along is justifiable, most of these scenes should have been restored for home video.)<br /><br />In Renoir's \\"Boudu Saved from Drowning\\", the title character is another \\"id monster\\" whose animal presence utterly disrupts a middle-class family. There's little doubt that Stripe blowing his nose on the curtains is an homage to Boudu wiping his shoes with a satin bedsheet.<br /><br />\\"Gremlins\\" also has an element of Hitchcockian voyeurism. One of the film's \\"pleasures\\" is watching punishment meted out to those deserving it, through an agency (the gremlins) whose behavior we are not responsible for. Our \\"murdering id\\" can be vicariously gratified without legal or moral consequences.<br /><br />\\"Gremlins\\" anticipates films like \\"Puppet Master\\", \\"Hostel\\", and \\"Saw\\", which tittillate the audience with scenes of people being murdered or mutilated in a graphic, detailed fashion. **<br /><br />\\"Gremlins\\"' iconic scene, in which Billy's mother kills three of the gremlins -- by grinding up one in a mixer, stabbing another repeatedly, and (classically) blowing up one in a microwave oven -- was the one that most aroused audiences (both pro and con), as it cuts close to the bone of how we would /sometimes/ like to handle our personal problems. Mrs. Peltzer isn't killing rats -- the gremlins are sentient, consciously malicious beings. Like, your boss, maybe?<br /><br />In the running commentary, Joe Dante remarks several times that, had CGI been available, \\"Gremlins\\" would have been an altogether different film. Indeed. One of the film's charms is the audience's awareness that it is watching fur-and-rubber puppets \\"live\\" on the soundstage, performing an especially nasty \\"Punch & Judy\\" show. CGI just wouldn't be as much fun.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer ranks a B -- \\"Gremlins\\" was not a sharply detailed film in the first place. (The image quality suggests an excellent projection print, rather than the camera negative.) On the other hand, one can better appreciate the beautifully complex lighting. And let's not forget Jerry Goldsmith's terrific score, one of his best. It's a pleasure to hear a score in which instruments are selected for their particular effect (a la Herrmann), and which doesn't continually drone on.<br /><br />Unhesitatingly recommended.<br /><br />* The name suggests the verb \\"pelts\\". The gremlins are very good at throwing things.<br /><br />** It wasn't the first. \\"The Abominable Dr. Phibes\\" (and its sequel) were quite gruesome, but nothing much was said about the violence.ills three of the gremlins -- by grinding up one in a mixer, stabbing another repeatedly, and (classically) blowing up one in a microwave oven -- was the one that most aroused audiences (both pro and con), as it cuts close to the bone of how we would /sometimes/ like to handle our personal problems.

B002XTBE6K|2.0|If you would like to watch a period film with nice production values, one or two good actors, and a plot reminiscent of Jane Austen's novel \\"Emma,\\" you might be interested in this BBC offering.  If you would actually like to see a film of the novel \\"Emma,\\" I suggest either of the two 1999 Emmas, with either Gwneth Paltrow or Kate Beckinsale as the heroine.<br /><br />Not recommended for those who value faithfulness to the spirit of the novel.

B002YDTPBQ|2.0|When you prepare yourself to watch \\"The Final Destination,\\" popping popcorn and pouring your soft drink, you should also prepare for one other thing:  predictability.  This movie is formulaic, the script isn't very good, and the gore is elevated to extremely high levels.  I can honestly say that I found myself laughing at both the dialogue and insane amounts of gore (you have to see certain scenes to believe them, and even then they don't make much sense). This is a fun movie, but not an Oscar-worthy one.<br /><br />If you want over the top bloody, gory fun, then this movie is fine.  Don't expect the script to be anything but messy, and don't expect spectacular cinematography.  It looks great on Blu-ray (but the 3-D scenes obviously don't have the same type of impact that they would have in theaters).<br /><br />Overall, an interesting part of the series, but it could use a serious overhaul to prevent it from being another \\"Saw.\\"

I liked the way that Gerry Anderson put together those kind of episodes also I liked his puppetry. The episodes were so put together that it seemed like the puppets were almost human and did things that us humans do. So for me that's why I bought Gerry Anderson's Stingray.

This is a must album for the lover of DELAIN. There best yet.

6304884419|5.0|This is a really great movie. It has the mobster lifestyle mixed in with everyday regular family life in the Bronx. With a father's struggle trying to keep his son from being lured into the glamour of a mobster's life.  The son learns valuable life lessons throughout the movie living his life in a marginal way with both the good and bad.  All in all it is a great movie in my opinion.

B001QOGYFY|3.0|This was a huge dissapointment! I couldnt believe all the potential this had to be a great movie and for it to basicaly fall flat on it's face was a true dissapointment!    It almost gave you the feel at one point that it was going to be another type sci-fi thing movie-ala John Carpenter style, which would have helped this movie.    The whole thing after the inital opening scene which was full of holes as well, no lead into what was going on, just Russians on a c5-transport shooting at each other, even the Kate Bekensail shower scene was a failure.    For the other strong roles like in the Underworld movies, this was a mistake for her to be in this flop.    Im glad I had some money credit when I ordered this on Blu-ray, I surley would have been upset to have forked out 25.00 for this crap.

0385341008|5.0|Initially, I thought this book might be a little too \\"light\\" for my tastes. I was very pleasantly reminded not to judge a book by its cover once I read it. Written entirely in epistolary form, the work is clever and witty. The characters are genuine and fully realized. Strong plot lines and stories manage to evolve from the characters' letters. The authors also manage to present a new chapter in the stories of horrors experienced by Europeans during the second world war. This book owes much to the famous female British authors of the 19th century and updates the themes and ethics of those writers adroitly and gracefully. Definitely read it.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption was easily one of the Top 10 movies of the 90s.  Despite a fairly formulaic plot, based on a Stephen King book, it's still a great movie.  People say that voiceovers are one of the ultimate cop-outs in movies.  It allows the plot to advance without actual acting.  But when Morgan Freeman is narrating, I'd watch a video about making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
B00005JLPK|1.0|Odd that the pro review describes Hayak's performance as driving this mess. If it is driven, it is in low rider mode, low and slow. A complete bore. This slow paced stilted account of these two prominent Mexican art figures is a disaster. From most accounts these two were both intricate, interesting and exciting personalities. As presented here, they are neither. Simple, offensive, self indulgent, hyper ego's, is a better description of the portrayals they receive.  They may have deserved better. We will never know, based on how they are painted here.     On the bright side, the soundtrack is a delight. Pass on the film and snap up the soundtrack.

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I'll start off by saying that the only reason I'm giving this product a 5 star rating is because of the option to turn off the overheating shut down.  I've shot probably 25+ weddings with SB-800's and never had a single overheating problem, but had my SB-900 overheat while shooting a reception on the VERY FIRST wedding I ever shot with it.  I purchased this flash in January 2010 so obviously the overheating thing is still an issue regardless of what you've read.  If I didn't have the option to turn off the safety features, this thing would be going straight back to Amazon.      On the plus side, the controls are a HUGE improvement over the SB-800.  They have a spinning dial similar to the dials that the non touch screen ipods use.  I'm able to adjust flash on the fly much faster than I could before.  I guess this doesn't mean a whole lot to those of you who use TTL ;0)  So far this is the most insight I can give since I've only done one wedding.  I look forward to being able to zoom to 200mm on portrait sessions & weddings in the near future!    Phil
0385341008|5.0|I fell in love with The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society and truly enjoyed reading this story. It is written in a letter format during the 1940s, which makes it all the more interesting. With a little history, love, family and friendship it has all the components to make a charming novel.

B0026P3G12|4.0|This CD showcased Susan Boyle's remarkable voice.  Enjoyed the choice of music from pop tunes to spirituals to blues.  Very enjoyable.
038534273X|4.0|For a non-computer type, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and learning about Google.  Easy to read, and gives a great historical perspective about the birth of the company.  Have recommended this book to several friends.

The bartender looks up and says, 'Get the [common vulgar word] out of here!'\\"<br /><br />The above \\"joke\\" is said by this movie's main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood, who also directed and produced this movie.)<br /><br />This story follows Walt, a recently widowed Korean War veteran who is alienated from his family and angry at the world.  Walt's young Hmong American neighbour Thao (or \\"Toad\\" as Walt calls him) tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Torino (or, more specifically, a Ford Grand Torino Sport Sports Roof) on a dare from his cousin for initiation into a gang.  Walt develops a close relationship with the boy and his older sister.  The gang does something to the older sister and Walt vows revenge declaring that \\"They won't stand a chance [against me].\\"<br /><br />(Hmong or Mong Americans are residents of the U.S. who are of ethnic Hmong decent.  Indigenous Hmong are specifically from the mountainous regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma. The Hmong are also one of the subgroups of Miao ethnicity in Southern China.)<br /><br />Despite the movie's deceptive simplicity, it evolves into something complex, powerful, and even tender.<br /><br />For those who like lots of mindless action in their movies, this movie can become tedious.  However, those with patience will be rewarded by this movie's end.<br /><br />This movie marked Eastwood's return to leading actor status after four years (his previous leading role was in the movie \\"Million Dollar Baby\\").  The then 78-year old delivers a superb performance in what he has said is his final film as an actor.<br /><br />Eastwood can make \\"Get off my lawn\\" (while aiming an M-1 rifle) sound as menacing as Dirty Harry's \\"Make my day.\\"  When he says, \\"I'll blow a hole in your face and [then] sleep like a baby,\\" he sounds as if he means it.<br /><br />Beware that despite some moments, Walt's toughness is more verbal than physical.<br /><br />This movie features a large Hmong American cast.  Even though the actor who played Thao (Bee Vang) and the actress who play his older sister (Ahney Her) had no previous acting experience, they hold their own with Eastwood and give convincing performances.<br /><br />(Note that Eastwood's young son, Scott, also has a small part in this movie.)<br /><br />The song in the movie titled \\"Gran Torino\\" was nominated for the Golden Globe Awards for Best Original Song.  This music was a collaborative effort of four people that included Clint Eastwood (who sings briefly during the end credits) and his oldest son, Kyle Eastwood, who wrote the music.<br /><br />This movie was recognized as one of the ten best films of 2008.  Eastwood's performance gained recognition winning \\"Best Actor\\" from the National Board of Review.  As well, this movie has grossed almost ten times more than what it cost to make.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2009) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has two extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is simply a remarkable movie.  I leave you with what Walt says to a young priest, the priest who presided over his wife's funeral:<br /><br />\\"I think you're an overeducated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life.\\"<br /><br />(2008;  1 hr, 55 min;  wide screen, 29 scenes;  rated 'R')<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXr /><br />This movie features a large Hmong American cast.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|Arrived before Christmas and was exactly what my brother wanted.<br />It was so easy.  Didn't have to leave the house to shop.
1416511946|5.0|I write books and also for MetalSucks so it's about time I reviewed some metal books. I'll start with a few rock autobiographies that have been out for awhile. First up is Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe and his needle gazing memoir The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star.    Mötley Crüe was the first band that truly got me into metal. Shout at the Devil was the album that ruined me for life. After going back and discovering their first album, Too Fast For Love, the deal with the Devil was sealed (my course was severely altered after the mediocre Theater of Pain and the emergence of a little band called Metallica, but that's a different story). I loved their attitude, image, and sound. It was the ultimate in packaged rebellion for a do-gooder kid from South Texas.    The Heroin Diaries is set in 1987, four years after Shout and two years after I stopped caring about Crüe. Sixx documents his personal downward spiral during that year, which is also the year they recorded and released their fourth opus, Girls, Girls, Girls. Decadence and debauchery are to be expected. Insight and self-discovery were not. Luckily, Sixx has the ability to bring all of the above emotions and more to the table in vivid, visceral detail, and it ain't perdy.    Sixx comes across as arrogant, egotistical, maniacal, and utterly self-destructive - and those are his enduring qualities. His treatment of his friends, bandmates, and family is appalling. His handling of his management, fans, and total strangers is even worse. Of course, he's a full-blown junkie meal ticket so everyone tends to look the other way. As a result, Nikki Sixx became an inflated, if emaciated, God in his own mind, and in the minds of millions of people worldwide.    Sixx's depiction of the life of a functioning junkie is harrowing, not because he turns into a droopy-eyed no-good slacker sloth, but rather because he was able to still perform at the highest level (Girls, Girls, Girls debuted at #2 on the Billboard charts and the band played hundreds of sold out arenas that year and introduced the world to Guns N' Roses) while under the spell of smack (and coke and Halcion and alcohol and Ace in the Hole and...). He became a modern day Caligula because he could and because others let him.    Sixx's writing (along with co-author Ian Gittins) is clear-headed, muddled, vicious, sweet, revealing, and mysterious. In other words, it's art. And, unlike most mainstream memoirs, the navel gazing does not wear out its welcome. Just when you think you've had enough of the \\"Oh, woe is me\\" Nikki Sixx, his unrepentant dark side, Sikki Nixx, rears its ugly head to bring laughs to the tome. Indeed, some of the most telling vignettes are when he rails against his bandmates Mick Mars and, especially, Vince Neil. Indeed, the book sails for me as a reader when Sixx steps out of his literal drug closet and hits the road with the Crüe. Even though I did not care for the band by that point, I was still fascinated by the dynamics of band interaction on display. Hilarious, revolting, and a bit sad.    Full of contradictions, frustrating yet entertaining, The Heroin Diaries is definitely worth having in your personal metal library even if you don't care a Ratt's ass about Mötley Crüe, glam metal, or Nikki Sixx. This 400-page dissection into a diseased, yet truly brilliant mind; is worth the dark trip even if it is guaranteed to get you hooked.    This review first appeared at MetalSucks on January 5, 2010    Be sure to pre-order my next book here: [[ASIN:078602013X Savage Son]]
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This sequel, really puts Batman sideways and bring Joker to the big screen as it was his own movie not his arch enemy  , as it was supposed to be. Allthougth the super-hero don't seams such a great thing, the movie itself totally surprises you in a great way.
1423113497|5.0|This recent purchase of Percy Jackson and the Olympians Paperback Boxed Set (Books 1-3) was a great buy. They came in great condition and has my child the most interested in reading than he's ever been. Thanks Amazon!
0575081961|5.0|I ordered my used copy because Cohen the Barbarian is mentioned in several other Discworld novels, and I wanted to complete my Discworld collection.  The story is top-shelf Pratchett, but the large-size, copiously illustrated format is really what makes this one of my favorite, most memorable Discworld books.  Artist and author clearly had a meeting of the minds, showcasing the same brand of absurd and witty humor.  One set of characters' attempt to sail off the edge of the Discworld is portrayed as a satire of NASA expeditions, down to a mission shoulder patch and medieval-looking \\"spacesuits\\" and other gadgetry designed by Leonard of Quirm (whose talent for fine art is hilariously evoked by Kirby's paintings).  Meanwhile, the aging barbarian warrior Cohen the Barbarian and his cronies, along with Death, Captain Carrot, the Patrician, and many other Discworld regulars, are detailed with wit and affection throughout the pages.  Among the several parodies of great Renaissance paintings, my favorite is the takeoff of God reaching out to touch fingertips with Adam: all the Discworld gods on one side, confronted with a snarling, superannuated Cohen the Barbarian giving them all the finger on the other side.  And the book's ending is one of the most satisfying (even emotional) endings of any Discworld novel.  Even if this title ever gets re-published in a non-illustrated format, I highly recommend springing for a used copy with these illustrations in favor of a \\"standard\\" paperback.
B001QB9H1A|4.0|This series is continuing to be a real grabber. The star is macho and keeps his cool.
B000FZETIO|5.0|\\"Pretty in Pink\\" has always been a family favorite and this copy doesn't disappoint.  It's perfect!
B002XTBEDI|2.0|After watching the first episodes of Cranford on PBS, I had to have the DVD as soon as it was released. Then, when I heard they were making a \\"Return to Cranford\\", I eagerly anticipated it. But, this is just one more example of a quickly thrown together (\\"lets capitalize on the success of the first with a sequel!\\" thinking) and very, very disappointing \\"return\\". I wish I had never seen the sequel, and in fact, have completely forgotten the sequel and prefer my own imagination of how things turned out. I'm happier, and so are my imaginary residents of Cranford!
B001CC7PPI|4.0|It was in excellent condition.Also I had clicked the wrong area and Amazon were going to send 2but all was corrected quickly to my satisfaction.I reccommended it               R.W.Mercer
0609610570|3.0|Some interesting case studies and generally useful advice. One star off for all the slobbering worship of Jack Welch. I and many of my colleagues saw the other side of him. He was like a neutron bomb -- wherever he went, the people were gone, but the buildings remained. Inside the company, he was known as \\"Neutron Jack.\\" Thanks, but I won't think of Welch as any kind of role model to emulate.<br /><br />Second point off for politocorrectoid smarm -- wherever possible, unidentified people are referred to as \\"she.\\" This is annoying and distracting.<br /><br />The execution of the book is just mediocre for these reasons. John C. Maxwell's books cover the same material and are much better, IMHO.
031606792X|4.0|I wanted to say something on behalf of Stephenie Meyer. The Twilight series/saga was hers to tell. All of these negative (one star) complainers, while having the right to complain, need to take a step back and examine themselves and their complaint. I for one, LOVED, the series/saga and wish for more stories from Ms. Meyer! To complain about how she ended the story of Bella Swan and her love for Vampires is a tragedy. Maybe it wasn't the way YOU would have ended it, but it's not your story. It's fantasy, and in fantasy, we all get our happy ending, or at least I do, so good for Steph for giving Bella hers! I just read Eclipse for the THIRD time and I think by far it is my fav, that and the first of coarse. But Breaking Dawn (only read it twice) is amazing and awesome, I think mostly because it's like no other story I have read before. I think many authors might have thought they couldn't give Bella complete and udder happiness at the end, but Stephenie Meyer was brave and decided to end the story on her terms. Folks are really hard on her and to them I say \\"Go write your own book, and get off S.M.'s back!!!\\"<br /><br />xoxo<br />Steph
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|This is an outstanding DVD....upbeat, well directed, excellent guest performers.  As it ends, I keep wishing there was more.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|We have the complete series & no matter how often we watch it, it never gets old or tiresome.  We now can't wait for Lauren Graham's new series that starts in March.  If it's half as good as this (well, if it *is* as good as this one) we'll be getting it as well.<br /><br />Maria (Ree) Maulorico
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Love this show!! I ordered this set and recieved it within 5 days. The service I have gotten with Amazon has always been great, would recommend them anytime. I have pre-ordered the second season, and can't wait to get it!!
B0019LY5IM|3.0|This show had it all, a good cast, excellent writing, wonderful concept--mysterious setting, riddles and even a monster (of sorts)---which carried it through 3 action packed, tightly executed seasons. The cracks began appearing (to me anyway) in Season 4. The show started getting sloppy (not to say it didn't have its moments, just not as consistently high in quality), but I thought that the production team had surprised me before and maybe there was a method to the madness---but then Season 5.  Lapsing into tired Science Fiction cliches and temples in the jungle that could have been pulled out of old Tarzan movies just didn't cut it for me.  It stings to fall on to this side of the fence---I was a true believer.  I'll limp through Season 6 with lowered expectations, wistfully wondering what could have been if they hadn't run out of gas.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|My son is into Starwars like you would not believe and has been for a while.  He was so excited to get this for Christmas and loves every episode.  Nice job on the DVD holder, very sturdy and appealing to Star Wars fans.
0307454541|5.0|Fascinating story. It has everything you need in a book. Love story, investigative story, intrigue.
0307269981|5.0|I had read the first book in 2  days, so I had to get the second one right away! He keeps you so into the story. I have been to Sweden twice so I know of some of the places he speaks of. I have already pre-ordered the next one. Can't wait.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|This was a great book. Interesting,fasinating, and educational are just a few words to describe this book. i usually watch television but i spent two and a half days spending all of my free time reading this book. It also relates to a book i read in school,The Odysseus which is kind of cool.I'm looking forward to reading the sequel.
B000TGJ8F8|1.0|About 2/3 of the way through this, I thought it was interesting. Then it started to look like  many other action films you have seen. I agree with the negative reviews. Cage and Moore are  good actors. I think it's one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. Luckily, it was on TV.  Now erased. (P.S.: People who write hateful comments should learn to spell.)
B000WMFZMY|5.0|I first saw this film at movie theatre in Madrid, Spain when it had just come out. It received a standing ovation from the viewers at the film's end, when the dead El-Cid, mounted on horseback (held in place), frightened the Moors, and finally just rode out to an emptu beach.    This movie took some historical license with how El Cid actually died. (He was not mortally wounded by an arrow, but died of a fever.) Nevertheless, this film is a pleasure for all and a \\"must see\\" for military historians, reenactors, and wargamers.
B000OPOAJS|3.0|Okay HD transfer but no commentary from John Frakenheimer?  Not recommended unless you are a big Ronin fan.
B001NXDSJI|5.0|The Woodstock 40th Anniversary 3 disc dvd set was a Christmas gift for my sister. I had shopped every where looking for it but the prices were sky high. It was less than 2 weeks before Christmas when I went on Amazon and found it for a great price. I was afraid I wouldn't receive it in time but it came in the mail less than a week after I placed my order!!! The item was in perfect condition!! The shopping experience was 100% satisfactory and my sister loves it!!
0060974176|5.0|Wow.  These guys in 1990 predicted the bailout of GM and Chrysler of 2009 and said that Ford was not going to be a victim.  It is kept my interest during the entire read and did not feel I was reading a dated book.  Anyone one that has an interest in autos, manufacturing or retention of jobs in the US should read this.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I hesitated going to see this movie at the theater.  I had loved Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan and thought it would be a disappointment with this new guy I had never heard of before.  Boy, was I wrong!  Daniel Craig was born to play James Bond.  There is never a weak moment in this movie.  It brings together all the best of what you expect from a  007 movie.  I watch this DVD over and over again.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|Great movies, like most great art, are the result of thousands of great decisions.  In the case of Moon by Duncan Jones: having original music scored by Clint Mansell, the same musical genius behind all of Darren Aronofsky's films; casting Sam Rockwell in the lead role(s) and Kevin Spacey as the on-board computer's voice; pegging the visual style within the realm of the sci-fi classics of the '70s and eschewing computer animation in favor of custom-built scale models.  All of this comes to a hilt within the beautiful opening credit sequence and you know you're in for a great movie.  The isolated claustrophobia is palpable and Sam's emotional journey is believable.  I don't think any film yet has portrayed the relationship between clones of the same man with such frankness and tenderness.  Despite their genetic equivalency, the two main characters exhibit distinct personalities and wrestle to define their unique roles in the narrative - the older growing frail, the younger (newer?) growing restless, both headstrong and self-sacrificing.  Because we don't truly know yet how to understand and define a relationship between clones, Jones and Rockwell push beyond our empathetic vocabulary by employing the two most accessible metaphors: the bond between brothers (younger Sam wrecking the other's prized possession) and the bond between father and son (older Sam teaching the other how to properly use a hobby knife).  Moon is a dark film with meditations on individuality and death and the limits of corporate industrial control but still manages to maintain an ember of hope that truth and wisdom can prevail.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|I never thought anyone could replace Sean Connery in my heart and mind for being the only real James Bond.  Pierce Brosnan came close, but the others were a disappointment.  In his second turn as 007, Daniel Craig has proven to me he IS James Bond!  He seems to have been born to play the part.  The story and execution of the script is exceptionally well done.  There is never a dull moment.  I watch this movie again and again which is rare for me.
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|This is my 1st Blue Ray movie. I didn't have the DVD version to compare with, but the video color and resolution are fabulous, and the audio is great. (Of course, I could be biased as a long-time fan.)
158270208X|5.0|I use it everyday since recieved. Even if no results makes you think about the things you have and the things that you want putting things into perspective. Not a bad thing. Makes it easy to say thank you. A missing comment for many.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I got this for my Fiancé for Christmas.  It was WAY cheaper than I could have gotten it anywhere else, even Walmart!!  She was so happy when she unwrapped it Christmas morning.  She's watched it at least 5 times since then.  I finally got to see it too (since I fell asleep during the midnight showing LOL)
0439882826|5.0|This is my second purchase of this book from Amazon. I thought it was so imaginative and exciting the first time, I decided to buy a \\"keeper copy\\" for my grandson whose 9. No one would be disappointed in this book, unless the cup is 100% empty. The visuals are amazing. Do not pass it by, even if you are not a Star Wars junky. I am not one, and am amazed by my reaction to it. I'm a 70 yr. old female. Who knew?
B000W746GK|5.0|I got this for my Fiancé for Christmas to replace her old VHS. She was really happy to finally have the DVD copy.  It was shipped quickly and for free since it was from Amazon and I was signed up for the free shipping thing.  You might want to look into that if you buy a lot! I think it was something like $75 for the year for free shipping for everything from Amazon and you can usually find whatever you want from them and get free shipping and if it's $5 each time that will add up quickly!
1932100660|5.0|All I can say is buy this book and at least read the first 100 pages.  Invest just 2 hours of your life in this book and it will reward you the rest of your days with good health.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I ordered this movie a week or so before it was released and to my suprise $10 wasn't the cheapest it was sold for, it went for ONLY $9.99 so they put that whole $.01 back in my account!!!  It sounds dumb but it's nice to know that they will do that even for just a Penny!!!  I will for sure be buying more movies from here!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Paul Giamatti provides a towering portrayal of one of our nation's brilliant, yet flawed, founders.  The miniseries gives us a fascinating look at the maneuverings of our earliest American politicians.  The relationship of Adams and his wife Abigail touches the heart, although their problems are not ignored.  Jefferson and the other leaders who dealt with Adams are vivid characters, not just icy portraits in a history book.  You will not find a better dramatization of our nation's history.  And this is our actual history; the series does not just use a historical backdrop for a nonsensical action  extravaganza.  Learn something about your country, and have a great time doing so.
B000W74EQC|5.0|I bought this for my Fiancé for Christmas to replace her old VHS copy.  She was really happy and excited to finally have it on DVD.  It was shipped quickly and it was cheap.  I signed up for the thing that gives you free shipping if you get stuff through amazon and so shipping was totally free!!

0764207407|5.0|Sense And Sensibility by Jane Austen<br />What can be said about a classic?  Much, I believe.<br />Austen wrote a book that is very instructive in how people face life and love.  Set in a time when many seemed to thrive on that which was deemed genteel and appropriate, but were very superficial, Sense And Sensibility shows the manner in which two (There were several others, but the Dashwood sisters are the two main characters.) sisters dealt with love.  Elinor was prudent, careful, and thoughtful (She used sense).  Marianne was passionate (Sensibile is the way Austen described her.).  They both fell in love, and both were hurt in different ways.  In the end, both learned the value of having a balance between careful, well-thought out approaches to love, and a passionate approach to love.<br />The ins and outs of their loves are not too different from our times.  Neither are the people.  The great difference is in the setting.  Human nature remains the same.  We can learn much about life from this book.<br />Bethany House Publishers has done the reader a service by providing appropriate historical details, references to various movies based upon the book, and humorous comments along the way.<br />Who would have ever thought that reading a classic could be so much joy!?!
B0012GMZ5E|5.0|This was released in 1969 - I bought the original when it came out and was not only devasted by the music - it was great but also by the audacity of not stretching it out to a fourth side. If you played the side it made almost 2 revolutions and ended. They had put everything they want to on the album and anything else would have been a detriment. Here is how it was listed  Side one   Memory Pain\\" (Percy Mayfield) - 5:34    I'm Not Sure\\" (Johnny Winter) - 5:23    The Good Love\\" (Dennis Collins) - 4:43   Side two   Slippin' and Slidin'\\" (Eddie Bocage, Albert Collins, Little Richard, James Smith) - 2:47    Miss Ann\\" (Enotris Johnson, Little Richard) - 3:41    Johnny B. Goode\\" (Chuck Berry) - 2:49    Highway 61 Revisited\\" (Bob Dylan) - 5:07   Side three   I Love Everybody\\" (Johnny Winter) - 3:43    Hustled Down in Texas\\" (Johnny Winter) - 3:32    I Hate Everybody\\" (Johnny Winter) - 2:33    Fast Life Rider\\" (Johnny Winter) - 7:00     Two other songs, \\"Tell the Truth\\" and \\"Early in the Morning\\" were included but were released on the 2004 re-release of the album. I would also recommend Johnny Winter and (1973) for 3 great recordings (live) My own fault, Mean Town Blues and Johnny Be Good
B002ODEJYE|5.0|I never really knew just how awesome PINK was until this dvd. The sound and picture are just awesome and PINK'S show is fantastic a must have for any music lover. One of my very favorite music dvd's and i own lots of music dvd's.
B000YAA68C|4.0|I had mixed feelings about this movie.. at times I almost abandoned watching it - wasn't sure where it was going early on.. but stick with it.  It is well done - a look at raw emotions going through the grieving process.  Not so intense that it wears you out - and in the end everyone comes out in the sunshine.  Worth the watch!
B001CC7PP8|4.0|So much has been written about \\"Psycho\\" itself that a buyer of the \\"Legacy Series\\" DVD of the film is probably most interested in whether or not this is a better or worse DVD of the film than has been available before.<br /><br />The \\"Legacy Series\\" edition of \\"Psycho\\" is a significant upgrade from prior DVD issues of the film. Nevertheless, it does not appear to be a recent high resolution re-telecine of the film elements. It appears to be merely a reprocessed and tweaked version of the same telecine source Universal has flogged over and over in a number of prior DVD editions. Dust and scratches have not been corrected, detail sizzle calls attention to itself, and the opening scene of the city skyline produce strobing as the camera pans.<br /><br />Contrast and tonality suggest this was made from a release print, or release inter positive, not from the original negative or master interpositive. It looks much better than before, but it hardly the best the film could look. Even played back on an OPPO BDP-83, which some might argue has the best DVD up scaling technology currently available for home users, the image still has a number of source quality, telecine and codec related defects.<br /><br />All of which leads one to ask: Where's the Blu-Ray edition of this film?  AND When is Universal going to get serious about these Hitchcock re-issues and finally do a modern, 4k or better remaster of these films from the original negative or the master interpositive?<br /><br />A great upgraded edition, but: wait for a Blu-Ray edition that has for sure been recently remastered from better film elements.<br /><br />--<br /><br />NOTE: Since my review was first written and posted Universal has in fact brought out a new, completely remastered, Blu-Ray edition of \\"Psycho\\". Picture quality, sound and features on the new Blu-Ray edition are SUPERB in all respects. The Blu-Ray edition is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

0385504225|1.0|This book is about:    A bad guy who wants to achieve his goal by killing everyone, including himself.  A good gal who researches a pseudoscience about how to reach the same goal.  A good gay who has something the bad guys wants, and support the good gal's pseudoscience researching using tax payer's money.  And a main character who knows nothing but likes to teach other people.    And in the book Dan Brown keeps on saying that \\"It is science.\\" No, it IS NOT!
0590454951|5.0|very interesting story especially with the political arena that we're now experiencing, who is telling the truth?
B0033B5XCS|1.0|I am looking at this when it comes out but unless this version contains the 91 minute version of Nightmare 5, I would not 2 buy this.  I have the big collectors set & I would like it a  smaller set but I am not wasting my money if the set is still 90 minutes in the dream child.
B001ILFUDM|3.0|Disney took the cheap way out by releasing this movie in 4x3 full screen format instead of one of the widescreen formats that Blu Ray disks are normally released in. This is the only Blu Ray disc I have seen in 4 x 3 format. I returned the Blu Ray disc because I refuse to pay Disney's premium price for a non widescreen Blu Ray of Pinoccio. I hope Disney re releases it in widescreen because it is an excellent movie.
B0026P3G12|5.0|She is one of the greatest singers I have ever heard and the the Amazon service was the best. I will order more when she cuts more DVD's. Do you ship to PR China?
B001TH16DI|5.0|This was my first Blu-ray disc purchase after receiving a BD player for Christmas.  I was very impressed. BD is head and shoulders above standard dvd in picture quality and, at least in this case, sound clarity.  The remastered movies made it as if they were filmed that way only recently.  The \\"Captain's\\" disc was great. It was a rare opportunity to see four of the most popular cast members of the franchise interacting with one another and the host.  I highly recommend this boxed set to anyone who is a \\"trekkie\\" or anyone who likes old fashioned sci-fi.
B0007PALRU|4.0|I doubt the science in this movie lines up like they say it does, but it is still a great story about survival and how you can count on human nature in dire situations. I love movies that make you think about what can happen to our civilization. We try to control so much, and it's nice to be reminded sometimes that we don't have all of the answers!
B001G9LVGG|5.0|This is excellent as is everything she does.  Great, beautiful singing, wonderful instrumentation.  I have many of her other CDs already.
B002VECM4K|4.0|PRECIOUS: BASED ON THE NOVEL 'PUSH' BY SAPPHIRE<br /><br />STARRING: Gabourey `Gabby' Sidibe, Mo'Nique, Paula Patton, Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz, Sherri Shepherd, Stephanie Andujar, Chyna Layne, Amina Robinson, Xosha Roquemore and Angelic Zambrana<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Geoffrey Fletcher; based on the novel Push by Sapphire<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Lee Daniels<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Drama<br />Release Date: 06 November 2009<br /><br />\\"And the Oscar for outstanding achievement by an actress in a supporting role goes to... Mo'Nique, for Precious.\\" There's your quote folks; sure to be said at this year's ceremony. Her performance was hands down the best I have seen from any actor, thus far in 2009.<br /><br />Mo'Nique plays Mary; an abusive mother who unrightfully blames her 16-year-old daughter for her husband leaving. Mary is haunted by herself and takes it out on those closest to her and would take it out on the world; if she ever left the couch. Mo'Nique's acting nearly knocked me out my seat, it was so powerful.<br /><br />Mary's daughter is Clarice who more often than not goes by Precious. Precious is a very troubled girl. At 16, she's still in middle school, her mother is on welfare and beats her continuously, and she's obese and pregnant with her second child.<br /><br />I was sure that she undoubtedly had a troubled past, but I found myself blaming her for her predicament. No-one forced her to have unprotected sex, right? I won't disclose what we learn next, but I felt like a complete jerk for judging her character in such an ignorant way.<br /><br />New-comer Gabourey `Gabby' Sidibe plays Precious and has my vote for a lead Oscar nomination, and will probably receive one. Watching her in this film, you wonder if perhaps she truly lived the life of this young girl. Gabby is a full decade older than her character, but we don't notice. She flawlessly portrays this troubled youth, who we feel for in every scene. We love her from the moment we meet her.<br /><br />Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey are both experts at evoking emotion from their live audiences and movie-goers. They have done nothing less with Precious, as two of its producers.<br /><br />The film is dark and gritty and may leave you questioning yourself in matters regarding the way you have judged or treated others in your life. No matter how you've had it, Precious magnificently shows both how hateful and twisted people can be, and how beautiful we can be to one anther.<br /><br />Precious is constantly abused, picked on, ridiculed and taken for granted. But she keeps on trucking'; with far more strength and courage than most of us would have the stomach for.<br /><br />She copes by escaping into a personal fantasy. We see several beautiful shots of her fantasizing of having her picture taken, boys drooling over her and her walking down red carpet. While I enjoyed these shots immensely, I would have liked to have seen Precious achieve more of her potential. The film feels a little incomplete without this.<br /><br />Regardless, the movie is still very entertaining and was shot amazingly. I'm sure it will win for best cinematography as well. Director Lee Daniels, who is also partly responsible for bringing us Monster's Ball, is an amazing artist.<br /><br />In addition to the visual spunk he gave this film, Daniels has also shattered any doubts of comedians and musicians not being able to act. Mo'Nique is a hilarious comedian; Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz are wonderful musicians and all of them become excellent actors in this film. Lee Daniels has stripped them of all the things we are used to seeing them as. No provocative clothing or dark sunglasses or charming smiles here.br /><br />Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey are both experts at evoking emotion from their live audiences and movie-goers.

B000006IUQ|5.0|Billionaire Charles Morse accompanies his supermodel wife Mickey to photo shoot at Alaska. The shoot is to be made by fashion photographer Robert Green. To find specific Indian for the shoot, they fly to even more distant location, where their small plane crashes into a lake. To survive in the woods full of man-killing bears they need each other, but the smarter of the men, Charles is suspicious that Robert is having an affair with his wife. This is a well written, well acted, well directed thriller. Anthony Hopkins as always turns in a great performance but the big suprise is Alec Baldwin who did just as well. This movie has some of the best dialogue ever written for a movie of this type, and the action scenes are clever with a blazingly paced. \\"The Edge\\" is a terrific movie.
B002UZCJ8Y|2.0|So that I won't be lynched by rabid Bruce Willis fans, I actually like most of his films and this film is OK.  However, and it is a big however, the storyline appears to be a mixing of the far superior \\"Blade Runner\\" (in its directorial cut) and the first \\"Matrix\\" film.  In a sense, this could be the beginning of what happened to people to get involved in a virtual world as the Matrix presented.  If they would have added something to the plot it would have worked better for me.  At the same time, I like Jim Cromwell, but it looks like he is in a rut of playing corporate bad guys.  He deserves better.
1891252097|5.0|I wouldn't learn Ashtanga from this book, but I wouldn't want to practice it without this book. It contains modifications and advice on the primary and intermediate series, as well as finishing postures. It's excellently photographed and lies flat, which is very helpful. I take Mysore classes and like to read about new positions to get another perspective on them, and extra pointers as a refresher. Highly, highly recommended.     Ashtanga really has to be learned from another person, I think, since it's very intimidating and you do not want to hurt yourself. Swenson emphasizes safety and doing things at the right pace, which is what I think any teacher worth learning from would say. Enjoy your practice!
1423113497|5.0|This is a great series on the order of Harry Potter.  Even if you don't have a good knowledge of greek mythology it is highly enjoyable.  After I finished reading these three books, I went out the very same day and bought the last two.  I am hoping that more books from the camp half blood series come out.
B002SEQ8ZC|4.0|great movie in an excellent boxset. would be a perfect gift for fans of coraline. comes with 3D version too and cardboard specs! although 3D was more effective in the cinema, the screen 3D version is just so-so...
B000M341RI|5.0|I watch this over and over, it is a very funny and well done movie.
B0026P3G12|5.0|All the hype about Susan Boyle's talent has been absolutely true. This is a wonderful first CD and I,for one, can't wait for the next one.
B002PMV9K6|2.0|Very Poor lproduction.  Too dark and disconnected.  Worst of the Harry Potter movies thus far.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|LOVED the movie.  Buying the four-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo was the smartest thing to do.  It was the same price to buy this through Amazon than buying just the dvd at any store.  I would definitely do this again with another title.  Thank you.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|Like having everything they ever sang.  Cannot distinguish a better sound than the CDs I already own.  Still nice to have.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This is an absolute wonderful movie, I bought it for my four year old and she loves it. She was so into it she never left the room for anything. I thought it might be a little too early for her, but I was so wrong. I'm glad I introduced her to it.      Thanks Donna
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Enya has a quality and style that is unique.  I own everyone of her CDs and like all of them.  This one seems even deeper and more mysterious.  Her voice quality and purity of sound makes it a joy to listen to.  I play it at work and play it over and over and never get tired of listening to her.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Saw this show live many years ago. The video captures the spirit of the show with vivid footage. Nothing of the magic is lost by seeing it on video.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|I will be contacting you later today.  This set was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She just started watching it and discovered that Season 1 had two disc #1s and no #2.  She needs the 2nd disc for Season 1, please.  Thank you.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|It didn't disappoint. Quality transfer to HD, unlike the disappointing \\"Goodfellas\\". This actually looks and sounds like blu-rays should... and it includes the extras that we've all come to expect in our fave movies. I can honestly say its worth the extra money to re-purchase this classic if u already own the dvd... Does not disappoint!!
B0064MT1U8|5.0|Well actually, this film stands on its own.  Who knows this could be the way it happened or should have happened. Writer Tom Stoppard takes a few liberties with reality and time to bring you the \\"True\\" story behind Shakespeare's genius, which would never have surfaced if it were not for love, friendship, tragedy, and a Virgin Queen.<br /><br />Young Shakespeare has writers block. Then he meets and falls in love with Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) the daughter of a nobleman, Viola on the other hand is interested in the forbidden fruit of acting.<br /><br />This film is set with one-liners and many witty inferences as each character plays off of the other. We almost had the play \\"Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter\\".  My favorite line is when Philip Henslowe: The show must... you know...  William Shakespeare: [prompting him] Go on!<br /><br />Do not miss Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth.  Her few appearances add spice to the film.<br /><br />Judi Dench as Titania in [[ASIN:6302940605 Midsummer Night's Dream (1968) [VHS]]]
1881273377|5.0|This book is great for helping understand why you get unexpected reactions from your spouse...cause most of us speak different love languages! I purchased the book for use on a long drive we were making together and it was definitely worth it...he never would have gotten around to reading the paper version but he was a 'captive' audience in the car!  And it gave us time to talk about what we'd heard. Our relationship is definitely better for the purchase!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Star Trek: The Original Series - Season One, was absolutely a best buy. The image was clear and sharp and we experienced no problems. I couldn't be happier with the product and will gladly buy more of the same. If you are an early Star Trek lover like me, I'm talking about the original series, and you wish to relive the experience, the excitement of sitting down in front of your television and watching that very first episode, you'll be more than happy with this package, and viewing it will take you right back to those old days just as sure as if you were in a time machine. Remember Jeffrey Hunter as Christopher Pike, the first captain of the USS Enterprise? What about Ricardo Montalban as Khan? And Nichelle Nichols as Uhura and Spock and Bones and Scotty and Sulu? They're all there, young and vibrant and adventuresome, just as you remember them. And, of course, there were too many guest appearances to count. I understand that others have had problems with these disks, but our copy was great. I give it five stars. Now beam me up Scotty!
0143038583|5.0|Michael Pollan entertains while he informs, surprises, and disillusions most hopes you might have had about the American food industry.  This book is a must read if you are at all interested in what you eat, and how its production is affecting nature.  Pollan follows the life of both a cow and a chicken through their confined lives in high producing typical american farms- which proves to be more revolting and dangerous that one might have thought.  He also explains why all those products at the grocery store have some tangent of corn in it:  \\"high fructose corn syrup\\" etc.  He also documents some small organic farmers and the processes they use to create sustainable farming.  How the food industry reflects the general American mentality should become increasingly obvious, as you become more aware of what you eat and where it comes from.      This book is an excellent way to make a visit to the grocery store a little less abstract.
B001TK4MO0|1.0|The seller sent me the wrong book and has not responded to repeated emails.  The book that was sent was totally different and of no interest to me at all.  A very unsatisfactory experience.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Adding to the ones I already had.....good price, beat everyone else and a good watch.
B001GAPC1K|1.0|I waited so long to see this film and when I got to see it on dvd it was by far the worst movie I saw that year.The reviewers make this movie overrated its so stupid you'll even might get distracted by Roberts drug crack eyes,it was so bad my little brother and mom walk out the living room to see something else,I felt so embarrassed that happen,oh and its nothing like the cartoon and Robert is too damn short to play such a tall man its ridiculous.There is no action at all only at the end and it still sucks.There is so much talking about crap no one cares about and robert trying to make the audience laugh with his corny boring jokes and its very long too so get ready to kill yourself at the end and no I will not be seeing part 2 if I want to see a crackhead I'll just walk down my neighborhood.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|Wow, so I must say that I am a Jane Austen purist: I don't read any of the continuation books, because I want to keep Jane Austen's wonderful characters in her masterpiece, 'Pride & Prejudice' in their natural, meant-to-be state, and not confuse them.     I don't know why I choose to pick this up, but I am SO glad I did: maybe because in my mind I already seperate books and movies...movies are often inspired by books or are edited versions of books, or are completely different, so I think of them seperately. 'Lost in Austen' was a hilarious & refreshing Jane Austen romp: you just have to have fun with it!     As far as content goes, I will watch it again shortly and come back & update this, but I don't recall much beyond a little language and maybe some sensual sitations: things like an unmarried couple living together in the modern world, etc. It's reasonably family-friendly:     The actors were great, Darcy was absolutely smoldering at times: when Amanda takes Lizzie's place, her modern clothes, language, actions & that song (you know what I mean!) are quite funny! If it were I that was pulled back into that world, I feel I would have fit in better: the twists on characters stories, and on their character itself, was more amusing than disturbing: just think of this as a fun, random, not-true film and you won't mind that the story is a bit skewed: you'll be too busy rolling on the floor laughing ~ definitely recommend!
B002C2XXJY|4.0|My daughter loves Demi Lovato so when she got this cd for christmas she was very excited.She loves the cd and all the songs on it.I thought it was ok,after awhile all the girls in that disney group sound the same.I would recommend this to people though.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I had seen the movie, UP, at a theater and wanted my daughter and her husband to see it so I ordered it from Amazon and had it shipped to them.  The online ordering was extremely easy and it was shipped promptly and arrived in perfect shape.    The movie is funny and touching and after seeing it the first time with a friend, I saw it again with my grandchildren.  It is a classic which will touch your heart while it tickles your funnybone.
B000063DFW|5.0|I love this cd as I think Linkin Park are one of the greatest bands of this decade. I love this cd in particular because it has the extended songs that were not previously on the U.S. version. My favorite is My December I love that song so much. If you like Linkin Park this cd is a must.
0071636080|4.0|This books reinforces many of the key elements of great presentations. Everything that looks impromptu in Steve Jobs presentations are perfectly crafted.....    I was in the middle of preparing for a presentation as I was reading this book. I went back and totally re-wrote my presentation and I believe it is ten times better!
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Quentin Tarantino at his best - close-ups of blood and gore may force some to turn away, but they will stay in their seats for a war movie with a difference. Great performance by the leading players, especially Brad Pitt as the blood-thirsty Apache and Christoph Waltz as the devilishly clever SS colonel. Plenty of surprises to keep you on the edge of your seat too. Could easily become another Tarantino cult film  Highly recommended
B000UX6OHK|5.0|I got this watch for my wife for Christmas.  It's a beautiful piece of jewelry and she really likes it.  She has really tiny wrists and I was concerned that there wouldn't be enough links to remove, but there was still a few of the little links left.
1439136653|3.0|It's been several months since I read this, so my review will be short.  While I understand conditions in much of India, this story was, at times, depressing to me.  I don't see all the hype given to the movie because of the story, but then, I guess that's America.  It was kind of an OK read to me & certainly not as wonderful as I'd expected by all the movie hype.  Oh well.
031606792X|5.0|Never a disappointment here!  I really hope there will be more.  There are so many different directions that these stories can go.
0517548232|5.0|Wonderful book.  Great for those who are learning about economics or need a refresher...like most of those in Washington.  The section on Tariffs was a little confusing but I will just have to reread it again.
B001L51RQE|5.0|Many people have commented on how generally great this DVD is, and I agree. I wanted to write this to specifically say how awesome I thought the drums were. Stewart Copeland was always one of my favorite drummers. His unique style of rock/jazz/reggae playing helped define the Police's sound, a degree of influence most drummers don't have on their band. His beats and fills were always interesting. Based on this album, I think he has only gotten better, and it is so great to get to listen and watch him play on a modern, state of the art concert film.  It isn't mentioned on the packaging or any reviews I've seen, but there is a drums only angle choice on 2 songs. Cool!  If you a drummer and you are reading this, just buy it! (I wish I hadn't waited 2 years.)
B000ZELISO|5.0|Although Book 6 is not my favorite book, I have to say that this time they did try to stay as much as possible with the book.  Compared with movie 5, movie 6 had most of the things I wanted to see (and I'm guessing a lot of other people wanted to see).  I can't wait to see how they finish the series, since they are splitting the movies (hopefully to follow the book even more) :)

0385340575|5.0|I have to thank Amazon readers for giving Lee Child books such good reviews, because I would never have bothered with them on my own. Somehow I had mixed up Lee Child with Lincoln Child, whose book Death Match was such a terrible, boring, go-nowhere dud that I avoided all authors named Child for years.<br /><br />Now I've read everything Lee Child ever wrote. He is just so much fun, a fabulous storyteller in the true English troubadour tradition, mixing a lot of fun factual trivia with a hero that is so outrageously improbable that it makes for a wonderful and satisfying reading experience.<br /><br />There are webpages for people who have read everything by Lee Child and are suffering withdrawal symptoms. I found some of them. If you haven't experienced the literary testosterone/crack cocaine speedball of a Lee Child novel, I highly recommend that you try it. Make sure you have a good book in reserve, though, for the comedown after you've spent a month or so reading nothing but Jack Reacher. I fell into a serious state of depression after I had run out of my fix. It took Michael Connelly to pull me out of it.<br /><br />The first few Reacher novels have an almost too-manly abruptness and an incredible amount of shrugging. As an inoculation, I suggest you read G. M. Handlon \\"the brewfisher\\"'s hilarious one-star review of the Killing Floor, entitled \\"I shrugged, he shrugged, she shrugged,\\" October 18, 2006. Here's my favourite part of Handlon's review, \\"Short sentences. Incomplete. He likes them. Loves them, really. Six word limit. Good for some folks. Not for me. No short attention span here. How about you? I shrugged. Why did I finish it? Dunno. I shrugged.\\" Yeah, Handlon makes a good point, but also cops to the fact that the Reacher books are tremendously compelling, even with their flaws. With Handlon's help, I cracked up each time somebody shrugged, which made the whole experience more bearable.<br /><br />Read by the king of audiobooks, Dick Hill. Need I say more?<br /><br />I review only audiobooks. Read my reviews, download, plug in, and you'll never be bored again.ooks. Read my reviews, download, plug in, and you'll never be bored again.
B00284G2JE|5.0|The Remaster/Reissue is a must own! This is bottom line the best Stoner/Doom Metal album ever made the songs are so thick and heavy it's like someone is pouring thick sludge over the Strings and melting everything in it's wake. BUY THIS!! The cover of Black sabbath's snowblind kicks ass!
0385532458|2.0|I know that Crisham tells a great story. I just don't understand why each of the short stories were so depressing. Usually there is some sort of redemption factor in his stories  but these lack it.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|You've already read how this movie was made in all these other reviews. I'll just add that this is a great movie, and it stays with you afterward. A day lateer, you'll still be saying to yourself \\"Oh! That's why such and such happened!\\". Don't miss it. You'll love it.
1577314808|5.0|This book had been sitting on my bookshelf for a number of years. I  finally started reading it.  It brought  together many other spritual writings in a way that was new for me.  Whether you come from a Buddhist, Christian or just a spritual journey perspective, this book will help you get rid of fears and past and future preoccupations so that you can live fully in the present and enjoy  your life more peacefully and completely. It has become  my most important book to share with others.
1416594787|5.0|Yet another well written book by Richard Dawkins.  This book explains evolution in such a way that any lay-person may understand it with ease.  Dawkins counters arguments made against evolution by explaining facts and dispelling common misunderstandings and misinformation.  He even explains the difference between scientific hypothesis, theory, and law, correcting the common misconception that theory becomes law (how the lay-person's use of the word \\"theory\\" is much different than what it actually means in science).  With his thorough and often witty writing style, Dawkins book is both educational and a very enjoyable read.   I highly recommend it for both young learners and adults.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|This was an addition to the other 4 seasons, so that after it ends this last season, we will be able to go back and watch it again and again. Great series.
B001B1876G|5.0|I don't usually review movies, but the one thing I hate about the internet is that it gives every stupid a-hole with too much time on their hands a voice.  I hate scrolling to the reviews section, and seeing anything but reviews.  Instead I find silly stupid aliterate people giving poor ratings to things for reasons that have nothing to do with the actual product!!    So, I decided to give this 5 stars, to offset all the negative \\"reviews\\".  First off, I know this is animated.  I can clearly see that it says it is animated on the box, twice even on the front!  Also, I do not see the names of Downey, Paltrow, Bridges, Favrue (?).  Third, I do see animated/cartoon picture stills from the movie on the back of the box (for those that can see it live).  That being said, it was a good movie, not only for an animated Iron Man story, but for one of Marvel's early attempts at the direct to video animated market (trailing behind DC, but quickly catching up, and maybe even surpassing).    In my opinion, Marvel tried to re-introduce Iron Man for the modern age.  This isn't a Silver Age or Ultimates storyline.  I still enjoyed it, and looking forward to a sequel.
0385341008|4.0|I had to buy this book for my book club. I was a little put off by the title, until I began to read. It is a lovely story about a woman and the friends she makes on a little island in the English Channel during WW2. It is entertaining, but also full of historical facts. I found it a little slow in the beginning, but stick with it, you won't be dissapointed.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|I love this movie. If you like action and suspense this is the movie for you. Liam Neeson still has it!
B0026P3G12|5.0|What a beautiful voice!  Coming out of nowhere, Susan Boyle has charmed the world.  Her rendition of these songs is memorable.  My only wish is that she'd included a few others, such as \\"Memory\\", that I know would have been wonderful.
B000VE439Y|5.0|Absolutely hilarious for anyone with an even modestly well developed sense of humor. The play on organized religion and their quirks is DEAD on! Easily watchable over and over again just to catch the bits you missed last time. Long Live Python!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I LOVE this CD and find myself playing it often.  There's not a song on it that I don't like.  I not only enjoy listening, but I frequently find myself singing along. My favorite is \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\".  ENJOY!!!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|As a LONG time follower of Star Trek I approached this movie with great caution. I was happily suprised as the acting, script, special effects are equal (at least) to \\"Kahn\\". A breath of fresh air to the series. Bravo!

B002I9Z89Y|3.0|I wish I could review this Star Trek: Season 2, But my Panasonic BD-10A player will NOT play it. Seasons 1 & 3 plays just fine and they are both great productions. There is a blog going about this problem below. I would like to know, what Blu-Ray Players all of you used to watch this Season 2? That would be most heplful in choosing a new BD Player. Thanks.<br /><br />2/9/2010 - I just bought a new Panasonic Blu-Ray Player BD-60 and it plays Season 2 without any problems. Good-bye BD-10A.
B000063Y8F|5.0|Three things recommend this press (and the extra money it costs):  1.  It is the easiest press to clean I've owned.  2.  It feels solid in your hand and is the sturdiest press I've owned.   3.  It is the most comfortable press I've owned.  I recently bought a second one for my son-in-law in South Africa.

B002EEP3NO|4.0|The Lego Star Wars Death Star is a neat, fun, and exciting toy that is appropriate for a true diehard Lego fan.  The complexity of building it requires an adult to participate for all ages up to teens.  While my 8 year old son was able to complete small portions of this set, an adult is necessary to interpret the sometimes cryptic instructions.  A buyer should be aware that this is an extensive building project with over 3800 pieces and an instruction book that is 256 pages.  However, for a real Star Wars aficionado, there are some incredibly detailed sections of this toy that closely duplicate the scenes in the movie and an overall authenticity for which Lego deserves high praise.  Also, the included minifigures are impressive and a big draw for most Lego fans.    As a word of caution, I would say that this Lego is not appropriate for amateur Lego builders.  Furthermore, those who do purchase should be prepared to have some frustrating moments while constructing this mammoth toy.  Nevertheless, my son is ecstatic to have this fascinating toy in his Lego collection.

0545123267|5.0|Quickie POV: Shiver is a beautifully written and touching tale that had me captivated from page one. The book is worthy of all the hype generated.  Stiefvater is an artist, her words paint a picture that seep through my skin and touch my soul.<br /><br />Review: The wolves are a presence in the woods behind Grace's home. They have become an obsession of hers ever since her childhood, when as a young girl she was drug from her swing by the hungry animals and almost devoured.  More so, the obsession runs deep for one wolf, one wolf who seems to watch her, protect her. The wolf that saved her from the others.<br /><br />When another wolf attack gets the town riled up and threatens her wolf, Grace is distraught.  She has to stop the hunters, she knows her feelings are crazy, but she would do anything to protect her wolf.<br /><br />Sam Roth is Grace's wolf.  Human during the summer only, he is trapped in an animal's body for the cold months. A tragic character, Sam thinks he is destined to just watch Grace from his wolf's eyes, and never know her as human.<br /><br />Beautifully written like all of Stiefvater's work, Shiver is a masterpiece of the written word.  The story is touching, the prose is perfection, the characters are so real I now feel I have new friends.  Sam's lyrics he recites during the novel were wonderful also - is there anything this author can't do? I am now officially a Stiefvater fangirl *woot woot*. If you haven't read anything by this author, RUN don't walk to your nearest bookstore or library and read her work.<br /><br />Quotable from book:  I slouched in my stoop in the sun and sucked in the summer as if I could hold every drop of it inside me.  As the hours crept by, the afternoon sunlight bleached all the books on the shelves to pale, gilded versions of themselves and warmed the paper and ink inside the covers so that the smell of unread words hung in the air.<br /><br />This was what I loved, when I was human.<br /><br />Recommendation: Sam and Grace have a mature relationship in this novel, so I would recommend this for 15+.  Nothing explicit and the language is prime time worthy. Adults will also enjoy this novel.  This is also not your typical werewolf novel - so I believe you do not have to be a fan of the fur to enjoy., so I would recommend this for 15+.

0786838655|3.0|Quickie POV:  Compelled to read because of the impending movie release I was captivated by the rich and entertaining story.  The Lightening Thief is fast-paced and high-energy, keeping you on your toes the entire time.  Yet, I found myself throughout the entire book thinking Dumbeldore might pop up at any moment and instead of a capture the flag tournament they might all run out and play Quidditch.<br /><br />Review: Perseus Jackson, known to his friends if he had any as Percy, is a troubled kid.  Kicked out of every school he has attended he has been moved around, man-handled and ignored for the better part of his life. Yet, strange things have always plagued 12 year old Percy Jackson.  Odd occurrences happen around him, so he isn't that surprised when his math teacher sprouts wings and tries to kill him.  It does anger him when everyone acts like nothing happened, especially his new found friend Grover, because Grover can't lie very well.<br /><br />Percy is intent on finding out the truth, but the truth is a little more than he expected and he is whisked away to summer camp, a special summer camp for the children of gods and goddesses.  A special place where the half-mortal offspring of the gods can harness their powers and learn how to control them and become the heroes that they were meant to be.  In an epic fight on the doorsteps of camp, Percy battles his way in...just to find the battle might not be over and there are whisperings.  Whisperings that he might be a little more than just the son of a god...he might be the one.<br /><br />While the story was entertaining the striking resemblance to the Harry Potter series threw me through a loop during the entirety of the book. It was obvious the author took the premise of Harry Potter and rewrote it from a Greek perspective. It was just too similar.  Twelve year old boy, orphaned, goes to a magical place to discover his true potential.  All the while the big baddie lurks...ever present and threatening.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, inspired by HP it is, entertaining and worth a read it is also. The book definitely kept me engrossed and wanting more.  I will read on and I will see the movie.<br /><br />Recommendation: Tweens, to Teens to Adults, everyone should partake. Harry Potter fans will very much enjoy unless you are territorial. The tone is young so go in and embrace your inner child.y HP it is, entertaining and worth a read it is also.

B001I82RVS|4.0|This film definately isn't for everyone. The gore level rises to comedic extents and the creativity in the film easily makes it a cult classic. As for many cult classics however, the acting is a little lame in parts, but you're too busy watching blood spill everywhere to really notice. All in all, for those who are into the so called \\"gore porn\\" this is right up your alley. :)
0441013597|4.0|This is an impressive novel, though not quite the Great American Sci-Fi Novel.  What makes it impressive is that in an era of technology-obsessed sci-fi, Herbert succeeds in fleshing out the characters of Paul, Jessica, and a few others; Dune was the best-described planet in science fiction until Robinson's Mars came along three decades later.    The problems?  It's rather difficult to get American readers to care about a feud between two aristocratic families in a future Empire, culminating with the hero making himself king, so Herbert has to turn Harkonnen into the ultimate heavy  (including making him homosexual, which dates the story) while making Leto and Duncan into cardboard heroes.  And sometimes the mumbo-jumbo gets ridiculous: in the first chapter Herbert says \\"The statement violated what his mother called his INSTINCT FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS\\", as if there was something exotic about having moral standards; why not just say Paul disagreed?  And, unfortunately, the mumbo-jumbo dominates most of the sequels, as reflected in titles like \\"The God-Emperor of Dune\\".

B0026P3G12|5.0|Having heard Susan Boyle on TV, I wanted to purchase her cd.  It is breathtaking and her voice is magnificent.  I ordered 2 more for friends.  I hope she makes another cd; one with all Christmas songs would be terrific.      Her version of \\"Amazing Grace\\" is really inspiring. And of course, she has made the version of the song from \\"Les Miserables\\", \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\",   her own. No one can sing it better.

0740748475|2.0|The plates are wonderful, great paper, great reproduction.  It is such a shame that they did not put the effort into the binding for this makes the other quality moot for the volumes fall apart on first opening.  At first we thought it was a quality control problem and we sent our first volumes back (all three volume bindings were broken front and back). When we got the second set, only one volume's binding was broken on first usage.  We went to a book store to check them out and see if it was just our ones and the display volumes in the bookstore had broken bindings also.  My son decided to keep the one we had, not wanting to risk getting a set with more volumes of broken bindings again and valuing the plates so much that he wanted it any way.  As I started, it is such a shame that they did not bind these volumes correctly.  They would be so much more valuable.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|It was a really good movie. Having read the book though I can't give it a full 5 stars. So much was left out, put in or just different. For movie goers only though~~~it is great. It's definately worth the purchase!

B001UV4XUG|5.0|The Bottom Line:    (500) Days of Summer occasionally gets too cutesy for its own good (e.g. the precocious 10 year old girl who knows everything about love) but it's a very smart movie when it comes to love and relationships, with appealing performances by Deschanel and (especially) Gordon-Levitt in the leads and a solid vein of humor running through the whole film; if you like romantic comedies but hate formula, this is the movie for you.    3.5/4
0571195709|4.0|In this short novel, the author is almost entirely concerned with exploring the distress and doubt that a man can feel upon reaching his final day with his wife and family before he almost certainly will carry out a plan to leave them the next morning, with no warning, just a note - the book's first line: \\"It is the saddest night, for I am leaving and not coming back.\\" The book consists of scattered, very sharp observations on marriage, women, desire, life, etc as the narrator looks back across his life in random fashion, focusing on relationships. The book does not necessarily promote a continual search for a perfect relationship, but it is a critical look at the trade-offs and realities, often unexamined, of marriage.<br /><br />Both the narrator and his wife Susan are smart, capable people - he being a screenwriter and she working in book publishing. Their facility with words hardly extends to their marriage, as it is beset with misunderstandings, pettiness, carping, detachment, and the like. On the surface, they have a comfortable existence, his wife being the epitome of efficiency, even strength; however, despite that \\"at home I don't feel at home ... there is desperation in her activity.\\"<br /><br />Though this move has been contemplated for months, the narrator turns philosophical, reviewing his reasoning, reconfirming his justifications for leaving. For him women represent a chance to \\"start afresh,\\" but a new relationship is not a casual endeavor. To touch another's body, \\"to put your mouth against another's - what a commitment that is!\\" How can one disavow such possibilities? He asks, \\"Is it too much to want a tender and complete intimacy? Is it too much to want to sleep in someone's willing arms?\\"<br /><br />He recognizes the radical, unsettling implications of desire: \\"How unsettling is desire! That devil never sleeps or keeps still.\\" Once desire takes over one's life, where does it end? \\"Surely you can't constantly be replacing people who don't provide what you need\\" Even his latest fling with much-younger, punker Nina, who caused a \\"violent jolt\\" whenever they met, has ended. \\"What makes me think I should have what I want?<br /><br />But can one really ignore fundamental incompatibilities? He knows that \\"Susan and I cannot make one another happy.\\" He doesn't want to openly admit that he actually does not want to love Susan, even reluctantly going to a marital counselor with her to avoid devastating them both. Despite the unhappiness, even on his last night he looks for some sign from Susan that he can remain with her and the boys, a tender gesture, something.<br /><br />This book could be dismissed rather easily. The narrator's obsessions and weaknesses are scarcely worthy of concern. Many marriages survive in similar circumstances, although at what costs? On the other hand, the book may be regarded as a sharp, even painful, look at contemporary marriage, perhaps the human condition, and the dilemmas that it can present.latest fling with much-younger, punker Nina, who caused a \\"violent jolt\\" whenever they met, has ended. \\"What makes me think I should have what I want?

B0026P3G12|5.0|Thanks so much for replacing the CD I Dreamed A Dream.  The first obviously got lost in the mail and I appreciate so much you overnighting the next one.  I truly love Amazon.  You people are the greatest.
B000O599WG|5.0|Its fun.  Plain and simple its fun.  After all movies are supposed to be fun and entertaining, isn't that the whole purpose.  I think it is.  Some moves now are for the special effects or the \\"wow\\" factor. Some try to woo you with the sex and skin factor and then there are those that are just plain entertaining and fun. This is one of those movies.  I guess the main attraction is being in my early fifties I grew up with these stars in this movie, its almost like watching a home movie with family. NO deep thought is required, no shame in letting the entire family sit and watch with you and no dead acting. Its just fun.

B002RB7VMA|5.0|I'm giving all five stars for the combined effort of both Michael Bubl&eacute; and Amazon.com.  You see...I find it difficult to get around, especially in the winter on a cane. (VA Pension) This way, I can download the CD without ever leaving my apartment.  And at a cheaper price than other download sites.  Once downloaded, I can always burn a copy or two to CD & print up my own CD covers using a Windows XP Media Center Edition PC.<br /><br />Michael Bubl&eacute; is simply the heir apparent to Ol' Blue Eyes - Sinatra; but more modern & upbeat.  I don't think Sinatra would've ever done a version of \\"Heartache Tonight\\".  Whether it be old standards, or something more up to date...Michael Bubl&eacute; covers it better than anyone else.

B002VKE1K2|1.0|My sister called me the other night raving about this movie that she just got done watching that scared the beejeesus out of her so I said \\"aww cool, what was it?\\" so she says \\"It's a movie called Paranormal Activity\\", I say to myself \\"uh oh\\" up goes the red flag in my head.  So shes telling me a little bit about the movie and it SOUNDS interesting enough but shes leaving out some important details that she forgot to tell me...but first:<br /><br />I don't believe in this crap, never did, never will...it's a stretch for me to believe in god because I was expected to believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny when I was a kid and we all know what happened to those things so now, as adults, you plunk me down in a chair and make me sit through 86 minutes of a film shot by a home movie camera ala The Blair Witch project, which I thought was a bunch of crap too but was far creepier crap than this and I only watched 45 minutes of this till I couldn't take it anymore, granted the woman's rack was well worth the 45 minutes I DID sit through even though I know of only ONE other woman that goes to bed wearing a bra (Pullleeease!)....I knew this movie was in trouble with me from the opening credits when I found out that it was shot with a home movie camera and not a traditional movie studio (the fact my sister forgot to tell me because if she had, I wouldn't have wasted my time or my money).<br /><br />I did watch this movie with the lights out in the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep during a snowstorm and it didn't help at all.<br /><br />I can't believe this movie did so well because...................it didn't do so well, sorry!, it sucked!

B002AOWXO0|5.0|Love this album. Scarlett has that retro 50's sound to her voice and Pete Yorn can do no wrong.
B002BPQ0Y2|5.0|I bought this album on the strength of their Grammy performance. Fergie sounded so powerful on Imma Be that I literally threw up my hands and finally gave into buying this album. I was and AM not disappointed. Let's get this clear: This is a party album! They're not exaggerating when they say the energy NEVER dies. Even the more down-tempo songs, such as \\"Missing you\\" and \\"Alive\\" are completely 'danceable'.     However, that said, even as a party album, there are tracks such as \\"Rock that body\\" and \\"One Tribe\\" that carry strong, social messages: love yourself, love each other,....the \\"Where's the love?\\" kind of lyrics that fans are use to. They manage to work these \\"positive vibes\\" in so skillfully that the album never drags. I found myself popping my booty while singing lyrics like \\"Forget about the evil that they feed you. We are One people.\\"      I have to mention that this is my first time purchasing a Black Eyed Peas album. Although I love some of earlier songs such as 'Pump it' and 'Where is the love?' I never really considered them as a truly impressive band. They just seemed like another pop ensemble that put out 2-3 good hits every now and then. Buying this album proved me completely worng. BEP have gigawatts of talent. This album, from my 'virgin' perspective is definite 5 star quality. I haven't listened to their earlier albums so therefore I cannot have any issues with The E.N.D.  I based my rating completely on the pure happiness I derived from listening to this album.     In other words, I completely dig this album.

0385523904|5.0|There a few books like this written today: concise, well-researched, plainly yet effectively written, and free of hyperbole.  This book is a very personal account of six lives in the failed state of North Korea.  The level of deprivation and humiliation these people endure is heartbreaking.  The book reads more like an outstanding piece of social anthropology than it does cut and dried journalism.  The author is to be commended for her ability to get inside both the hearts and minds of the people she has interviewed.<br /><br />I think that Nothing To Envy is a landmark book, a study of a culture and political system gone horribly wrong, that will be read for decades.  As the author notes, North Korea is the last of its kind, a state with an entrenched despotic, supposedly Marxist, leader who denies not only basic freedoms but also the basic provisions necessary to maintain any quality of life.  Reading this book in the comfort of my own well heated home, I felt both pity for those that live in North Korea and anger for the inability of the rest of the world to do anything while North Korean's citizens starve to death.  The impact of this book is both emotional and intellectual.  I highly recommend this book to anyone concerned about the social welfare of people and the role that government plays in people's lives.
B0029O08WA|5.0|New Moon Soundtrack is as good as Twilight or could be even better. It again depends on you preferences in music but for me it is a perfect choice for rereading the book. It helps refresh the memories of my own.    Try to shaffle the collection on your player and see if oyu like it better. I simply rearranged the tracks to better suit my perception of the book events. Since the movie is the Book adaptation I choose to go by the book. It does magic  Try it yourself, see if it works. Unless you already love the music.
B002T921DE|4.0|Brilliant picture and sound on this blu ray. George Michael plays all his hits then some. If you saw the 25 concert, then this will bring back fond memories. Would have been nice if the making of featurette included some US concert footage as well.
0452286751|5.0|Having read Atlas Shrugged first, I may have been expecting too much from Ayn Rand in this book but I was not disappointed. The Fountainhead was another example of Rand's genius we so seldom experience in today's writers. Commercialism has captured and doomed any ability that most current writers might possess so it is impossible to compare The Fountainhead by utilizing the same scale of 2-stars, 3-stars, etc. that we use for other works; such comparisons just don't suffice. However, being limited to 5-stars, this is the level I choose.
B00140PK6O|5.0|\\"Cranford,\\" originally shown on PBS, is a multi-week mid-1800s soap opera and is one of the best I've seen -- enough so that I've sprung for the DVD.  Amazon gave me a better price than PBS quoted, too.
B0006ZRX86|5.0|This is an album! The mindset today is to pick out songs for your I Pod or whatever electrical device they have now for personal listening. Funeral is something you put in the CD player and don't stop listening until the last song is done. I enjoyed this album from beginning to end and recommended it to friends who all shared the same opinion. This is a great listening experience.
0451169514|3.0|I feel guilty giving this book three stars. I am being overgenerous simply to make myself feel better for putting so much time into reading IT.  Stephen King can kill any suspenseful moment with excessive and unnecessary detail.  That assumes however that there is suspense in the book.  I almost feel that IT would have been better without the presence of the clown.  Throughout the book you do develop a sense of closeness with the characters, only to be let down by a ridiculously boring ending and a total lack of terror.
0743437497|2.0|I read half of this book in 2008 and had to stop because I was so bored.  I decided to finish it a couple months ago and wish I hadn't.  The decision to finish The Shining led me to one of the gravest mistakes of my life; I read the book IT.  I have heard so many people sing the praises of Stephen King that I figured the Shining was just a bad fluke and decided to read IT because of all the regards it has received.  The Shining is not a fluke; Stephen King is just a boring author that doesn't understand the genre of horror.  Maybe these books were good back in the 1980's when horror sucked.  I won't go into the actual details of the book because they are way too ridiculous.  Watch the movie instead; Stanley Kubrick actually had vision for this story.
B00003CXB6|5.0|Bought for 6 year old grandson.He had been waiting for it so of course he loved it.He had the other 2 movies and I could not find in stores with out packaged with the other 2.I was very pleased with the fast shipping service.

B002XMGGK6|1.0|Talk about a terrible ending I usually dont review things but this movie was so bad i had to make a review so no one else will waste their money. This movie has a great story about a father getting vengeance against the screwed up legal system and corrupt politicians but then ending is terrible. Talk about a major letdown I guess if you like a movie where evil prevails and the government wins by cutting deals and being corrupt then you would like this movie.<br /><br />Overall the ending of law abiding citizen the worst ending that I have ever seen even though i spent $20 for this movie im throwing it away because its not worth being in my collection.
B000001ZS3|5.0|Welcome to late 20th century electronic music! This was originally released in 1977 in an era this music was lumped into the \\"New Age\\" category. If your looking for good melodic electronic music you've found your disc. I have four of this artists discs all of which I call his early essential works: 'Oxygene', 'Magnetic Fields', 'Equinox' and 'Zoolook'. 'Oxygene' is a intriguing yet contemplative work that moves smoothly from track to track. If you have some good headphones it easy to get lost in this work. I highly recommend all the discs I mentioned above all which are pleasantly unique. You may have some trouble finding all these works, but they are well worth the quest.
0545123267|5.0|Enthralling.  Couldn't put down this gripping tale of growing love between a high-school girl dealing well with her distant and flaky parents and a sensitive, abused boy trapped in the change from human to werewolf.  I lost most of a night's sleep tracing the growth of their devotion and the resulting skillfully depicted changes in their relationships with parents, mentors, and opponents.  The parallels between their almost mystical love and the eerie, delicately traced settings in town and woodlands reinforce the haunting mood.
B000E1ZKLE|5.0|This adaptation is wonderful. It does a great job of hitting the major points of the book. Look, no movie could really do the whole book justice, but this does a fantastic job of telling the beautiful story. My only beef is that Hugh Grant seems to play the same character in every movie, but he fits well in this one.    As far as the negative reviews some have given, I'll just say this: Subtlety and nuance is lost on a FOOL.
B001EP8EL2|4.0|\\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\" reached American theaters in a truncated form one year before \\"Star Wars\\" blew open a giant junk-shop door in the culture that still hasn't closed to this day. \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\" was a complicated film that had David Bowie, at the height of his exotic powers, as its main calling card. It told the story of a space traveler from a dying planet, with a visual intelligence similar to the same filmmaker's \\"Walkabout.\\" \\"Star Wars\\" was a comic book come to life. Guess which one Americans fell in love with? The Criterion Collection blu-ray of \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\" gives the film a second chance to get overlooked, ignored or puzzled over in the marketplace. Thank you! Many minutes have been restored in this, director Nicholas Roeg's approved version, and, as others have written, the transfer and sound are gorgeous to behold. Blu-ray is a brilliant format, and that stores and Netflix are charging more to rent them will inhibit their growth. They should become the norm, the standard. They are amazing. My video store, Potomac Video, rents them at the same price as DVDs, as they should. I thank them. Retailers should stop killing the goose that could lay their golden egg, and put blu-rays front and center in their displays. Have you ever noticed that the physical video stores still remaining don't sell hardware -- DVD players and blu-ray players? They just don't get it.   Anyway, what struck me most in revisiting \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\" all these years later is Candy Clark, who I believe turns in one of the finest film performances of the '70s here. She is heartbreaking as a simple southwestern hotel housekeeper who finds herself shacking up with an alien who she loves but can't possibly fathom. Knock that role out of the park, and you are a great actress. She was three years removed from her triumph (Academy Award nomination) in \\"American Graffiti\\" and had done no notable work in the interim. How can this be? Why did Hollywood overlook this gifted and beautiful actress? It would be two years before she returned with an aging Robert Mitchum in a little-seen remake of \\"The Big Sleep.\\" She then reprises her role in an inferior return to \\"American Graffiti,\\" makes something forgetable, and then winds up with Michael Moriarty in \\"Q: The Winged Serpent\\" from nut job Larry Cohen. I like her challenging work, but Candy Clark deserved a much better career. Her character's life with Bowie's alien is marked by her increasingly desperate attempts to please him. She could handle the gun play during sex, a scene that had enormous impact in its day, but his detachment and obscured motives bring her to ruin, and she begins to reach for anything, including making herself look like a geisha, showing her total, clinging, pathetic devotion to him. It is a remarkable performance that climaxes several times when she finds out the truth. She is the human center of the film. Another human aspect is the portrayal of a gay couple in \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth.\\" This was 1976, mind you, many years before \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" and yet it is a mature, matter-of-fact display of two men who live together. No over-the-top hysterics, none of the laughing and twittering that still too often is a signal to the audience that it is ok to accept gays in culture. It is quite a nice piece of quiet commentary in a film about a being from another planet. Band of outsiders, indeed. The story, which from reading some other reviewers here, was hard to grasp, is that Bowie's Thomas Newton has come to earth because there is abundant water on the planet. His ambition is to find a way to save his home, or at least the wife and children he left behind. With nine original patents he becomes one of the richest, most powerful businessmen in the world, and he drives that wealth toward building a ship that will take him back through space. He is absolutely otherworldly and the joke is that he says he is from England. Business competitors don't like that he doesn't play ball and infiltrate and destroy his empire and then he is captured and experimented on by the government while being made into an alcoholic. The film is a subtle but blistering commentary on modern American culture, its trash television, its addictions, its vacuousness, its pornography, its casual violence, its destructive capitalist nature, its secrecy, its inhumane medical apparatus, the absence of empathy for those not like us, the inability to make deep emotional attachments, it goes on and on. \\"Star Wars' was lucky not to have predated its exacting knife. It is also, as if that is not enough, a tragic masterpiece, with two loves unrequited, the woman who loves the alien and the alien who can never again return to his family back home. Time passes by and everyone ages but Bowie. It's shattering to see, more so because of Roeg's remarkable restraint. The old adage, \\"Show, don't tell,\\" is on full display. No, there is not a lot of action; yes, it is beautifully thought-out and rendered. There is a scene in which Bowie takes a scientist into the capsule he's built to fly home (a shot of it was used on the cover of the original release of the \\"Station to Station\\" album) and asks if he could be comfortable in there. The scientist replies that he would go stir crazy very quickly. I think potential viewers of the film have to ask themselves the same question because this is no thrill ride on the Millennium Falcom, that's for damn sure.
B00005JMK0|5.0|Just scored the DVD in Sydney for A$10, anamorphic widescreen.    Had been looking for it for years, in the US.  Gave up some time ago.  Last time I saw \\"Electric Dreams\\" was at its original theatrical release.  Brought it home and watched it immediately.    The movie still makes me smile; it's every bit as good as I remembered.  It's 80's, make no mistake.  But the best part of the 80's.    \\"Electric Dreams\\" caused me to fall in love with San Francisco and I moved there 15 years later with my girlfriend (now wife).   This movie makes me miss San Francisco.; no other city in the US like it...
B0026P3G12|5.0|After seeing Susan Boyle's YouTube performance, I looked forward to her CD to see if she could sustain the excitement that had built up around her. I had two friends who also wanted the CD, and I ordered three copies from Amazon.com. My friends love the music, and I play the CD over and over again in my car. I love most of the songs and just can't get over her range of style and music. The songs are different musical styles from a Beatles song to very contemporary songs that I had never heard before. She seems to caress the lyrics with her voice, and they come out as if they are encased in velvet. I am delighted with the CD and recommend it to everyone. When is the next one coming out???
0805091742|3.0|Dr. Gawande acknowledges that this book grew out of his December 10, 2007 New Yorker article, \\"The Checklist\\". I suspect that, for many readers, it would be a better use of their time and money to read the article (which is available online) rather than the book. Although the book, like Dr. Gawande's previous books, is well-written, the author's essential conclusions could easily be summarized in one page (and have been in several reviews).
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is one of the best mini series I have ever seen! When I first saw this movie on HBO, I knew I had to have this movie as part of my DVD movie collection. Paul Giamantti and Laura Linney are both great (I saw both of them in other movies, Eg: Sideways, The Truman Show, Saving Private Ryan) as are the actors who play Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and George Washington. I like the movie scenes where John Adams comes to the aid of his countrymen at the Boston Massacre (I have been to the actual site, the Old State house, when I lived in Boston) and the scenes after the Battle of Concord and Lexington. The bombardment of Bunker Hill was especially moving as was the part where George Washington is sworn in a the Nation's First President. I give this movie a 6-star rating! (I know 5-star is the best, but it is better than 5-star) plus the music at the beginning is kick butt music (makes you want to go out and fight the British yourself! Don't Tread on Me!). In conclusion, it is well worth buying. I think you will be pleased with the results.
1881273156|5.0|Wonderful book with wonderful ideas and thoughts.  Great insight.  Good for couples of any ages.  Really makes you think and ask the right questions of yourself and your partner...

0670033049|2.0|John Steinbeck is considered a great writer and for years I heard this was his masterpiece.  I finally picked it up one day because I loved the movie (the version with James Dean).  I quickly found out that the movie only covered the last fourth of the book.  Still, despite the length (601 pages), I decided to read it anyways.  Man--this was a struggle!  It's a slow-moving \\"epic\\" that follows the Trask family from the Civil War to WW1.  There are tons of characters and situations but it's not an easy read.  Steinbeck was a good writer--his descriptions of California and Salinas Valley are beautiful.  However when it came to characterizations and motivations he was terrible.  All the characters are either evil or good--very black and white.  No shades of grey.  They don't speak--they preach.  I don't think anyone ever talked like this in real life.  Every single event or twist is oversimplified and talked to death.  More than once I got the unpleasant feeling that Steinbeck was talking down to his audience.  Also whatever his message was (I'm assuming he had one) it's totally lost as the story just rambles on and on and ON! As for the ending--it's kind of silly and pointless. It doesn't even SEEM like an end.  It seems Steinbeck just got tired of writing this and gave up.  I got through this hoping there would be some point (or POV) but there wasn't.  I'm surprised this was published in 1952.  Some of the material (mostly dealing with sex) was pretty explicit.  I heard this was not a big hit because it was considered too simplistic and anti-climatic.  I agree!  The movie simplified it even more (but the Hayes Code was still in effect so they had no choice) but it was more interesting. It some excellent actors (James Dean, Raymond Massey, Julie Harris) fleshing out their characters and even gave some motivation and feelings to Kate (Jo Van Fleet won as Oscar for her acting) who is just evil and nothing more in the book. It's never a good sign when a movie adaptation has more interesting characters than the book!  So--it's too long, too obvious and just rambles on and on for no rhyme or reason. Skip this one.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle sings a variety of songs to please everyone.  Her voice is so beautiful and inspiring.  Having watched her performances on TV, I could  hardly wait for her first CD to come out.  It was definitely worth the wait.
B002O3Z4W0|5.0|This was a gift for another Ann Rice Fan.  When I saw the movie, it was well done.  The acting was a little over the top, but that's normal for horror flicks.  The book was much better.  If you order the DVD, be sure and order the book, too.

B0030MM68O|2.0|I cannot believe this movie is nominated for awards...  really?  It was terrible!  My husband and I watched it until the end continually hoping something endearing would change our minds.  Uh, nope.  I didn't give a crap about any of the characters since their personal development as well as the development of their relationships was so scant.  So much of the movie was unrealistic I don't know where to begin.  Anyway, I love reading reviews- so it's only fair that I give mine, too.  Sorry guys, but I wish I would have passed on this.

B00065MDSQ|5.0|Briefly, this album is unique in all of pop music (for me, at least) for its almost unnatural ability to combine cold, dark, machine-like fury with sublime beauty. It's one of the few albums which I can confidently describe as unlike any other I've ever heard. I consider \\"Providence\\" just a bit of a foreplay, but the other 4 pieces are classics of dark, foreboding, grinding, weeping rock that is far beyond metal in its heaviness. For those who want something more than typical pop, but also demand content and musicianship in their rock, this album is nonpareil.

0823003590|4.0|Even though the title is misleading in that this book is only a complete guide in a single highly stylized method. It does cover that method very well.  It approaches portraiture using a method made popular during the renaissance where light and shadow were used to create form and volume with little use of line.<br /><br />Anyone interested in artelier style instruction will find this book extremely useful. Even for those who are not interested in this specific artistic style and method, this book will give you food for thought.

B00005JKES|5.0|I purchased this back in 2000 I believe, and it has managed to impress me ever since.  As a matter of fact, I just recently pulled it out and put it in my blu ray player (with upscaling of course,) and it looked incredible on my HD televison set (1080p.)  This was released almost a decade ago, so that really says something.  Plus, if your a fan of DTS, as I am, this is the only release of season one worth owning as it sounds far superior to the Dolby Digital mix found on the Gold Edition.  The colouration of the video on this particular release is far superior to the Gold Edition as well.  Overall, this is certainly the best available release of Twin Peaks Season One currently available.  I'd get it while you still can.
B000VS6P9Q|4.0|The intricate guitar work on All Along The Watchtower makes Eddie Vedder's a respectable rock cover, while [[ASIN:B000003TAL Sonic Youth's]] interpretation of I'm Not There has a vaguely menacing start that morphs into the melancholy; it's quite unusual to hear this band doing a tender ballad with such feeling. The style changes to appealingly arranged country-folk with Jim James & Calexico on Going Down To Acapulco and stays in that genre as [[ASIN:B0000047R8 Richie Havens]] performs a jittery take of Tombstone Blues.<br /><br />Stephen Malkmus' mid-tempo Ballad of a Thin Man impresses with its instrumental flourishes, Cat Power's Memphis Blues likewise charms with its instrumentation and Yo La Tengo's Fourth Time Around is a sensitive understated gem. The mood turns exotic on Dark Eyes with its oriental-sounding percussion, then explodes exuberantly on Karen O's edgy Highway 61 Revisited. [[ASIN:B000002VHO Roger McGuinn]] & Calexico does a subdued but moving version of One More Cup of Coffee whilst The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll gets a typical acoustic guitar singer-songwriter treatment by Mason Jennings.<br /><br />I love the swirling, uptempo Billy by [[ASIN:B000CCD0F8 Los Lobos]] as well as Mark Lanegan's brooding Man in the Long Black Coat. Mira Bilotte takes a pop approach to As I Went Out One Morning but it pales beside Malkmus & Lee Ranaldo's brief but atmospheric Can't Leave Her Behind and [[ASIN:B0001F7U9S Sufjan Stevens']] memorable Ring Them Bells with its frequent tempo changes. Just Like a Woman is sung in a soft, whispery voice by Charlotte Gainsbourg while the ecstatic I Wanna Be Your Lover by Yo La Tengo stands out.<br /><br />Glen Hansard & Marketa Irglova's old-style folkie You Ain't Goin' Nowhere is quite appealing but Ramblin' Jack Elliott's bluegrass rendition of Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues is a real treasure, soulful and absorbing. The hard-rock Wicked Messenger and [[ASIN:B0000AI45P Tom Verlaine's]] sleepy Cold Irons Bound don't resonate much with me, nor does Mason Jennings' The Times They Are A Changing which attempts to imitate Dylan's original with harmonica and all.<br /><br />It's a matter of taste; no tracks are really bad and there's plenty of variety. Overall, this is a surprisingly appealing album and a fitting tribute to Dylan. The most devoted fans and purists will probably reject the album outright but I've found many tracks of merit and as mentioned before, there's no total disaster anywhere.

0385339682|5.0|It is not a court-room drama nor a classic Grisham nail-biting thriller; The book is about the life of a journalist in a small southern town and his interactions with the town's inhabitants. The gem of this book is the nostalgic recollection of small-town America during the late 60s and 70s. The novel covers everything from the civil rights movement to the invasion of the corporate giants (Bargain City) that virtually destroy the town. The main plot is about a murder and trial that haunts the town for years. The book is hilarious in some parts and very sad in other parts.<br /><br />When I read a Grisham book I normally don't intend on reading the book again...'The Last Juror' is different...I will for sure read it many times again.<br /><br />5/5
B000067J1H|5.0|This movie is probably one of the most violent movies that I have eve ever ever seen in my entire life! It has a plot that is something you would only want to dream about and then be certain about waking up afterwards. It is sneeky, bloody, traumatizing, and thoughtless as heck! It makes you wonder what kind of people really do this sort of thing to each other. I could not ever imagine what I saw in this movie. Whew! It was worth me buying it after watching in last Sunday on cable tv.
B0014YVC6W|5.0|...as the sticker states on the outer cellophane of this BluRay.  Well,,,,, AWESOME! But unfortunately awesome isn't enough to describe the superior quality of this BluRay. It looks better than it ever did on the big screen, when the movie first came out! LOL  While I realize that there can be so many variances for each individual film (including DURING INITIAL PRODUCTION), if there is a current  benchmark to measure BluRay quality, this has to be near, or at the top!  This transfer also looks better than many other movies on BluRay, many of which have also come out long after Short Circuit! Anyway, I hope that as many as possible older movies can be transfered to BluRay with the end-result being a level of quality at least equal to, or near, this! :)
B001IMFHVG|5.0|Whatever the limitations of the sound and video of this DVD it is an absolute pleasure to be able to watch and listen to Rubinstein play. His love of the music, his audience, and life are in full evidence. With many musicians you want to close your eyes and just listen because it is distracting to watch them. There is so much tension, anxiety, or artifice in their face or body motion that it becomes a distraction from listening to the music. Rubinstein clearly loves this music and is willing to make mistakes in the more difficult passages as long as the beauty, power, and line of the performance benefit. If you enjoyed this DVD, I can also recommend the two DVDs on DG. The BMG Chopin Box of 11 CDs is one of the greatest bargain buys to be had.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|Sherlock Holmes has been so standardized that this new film is absolutely thrilling and fascinating. Of course we can look at it as a \\"touristic\\" guide to 19th century London, with mud, crime, squalor, bleakness, and it is true little of the top class or upper society. This London has been shown very often from Oliver Twist to Dracula or Elephant Man. But that is definitely not the main interest of this film. Then there is the fight against crime. There are two types of criminals. Lord Blackwood who is trying with a secret society that believes in human sacrifice to frighten the populace to establish the fascist rule of the upper class who wants to reestablish a total and absolute centralized power that has  never existed in England anyway. And then there is the scientific crime that tries to transform crime into a fine art, the eighth fine art of this world but whose objective is only stealing and getting all the most beautiful stones, gems and the biggest piles of money they can, but with the beauty of a wizard. Lord Blackwood is another Voldemort and in a way Irene Adler and her boss are criminalized Harry and Hermione Potter. But that is of little interest except that it creates a phenomenal action. What is most important here is the relation between Dr Watson and Sherlock Holmes, a full and absolute homo-friendship. They cannot live without each other. They cannot even survive without each other. They realize that homo-friendship in their action against crime. But the film is extremely clear and careful to show that this is only a friendship between two souls and that the only male element in that friendship in the male action, and by male I mean violent and disruptive, physical and muscular. And the film shows how these two men are obsessed each one by a particular woman. Dr Watson will be able to satisfy his sexual hunger by marrying his Mary, but she will have to become the go-between of the two men. She will have to bring her husband, soul and mind tied up, at the feet of Sherlock Holmes for one more batch or episode of adventure every so often. Dr Watson can love Mary only if he can love Sherlock Holmes and take part in his capers and adventures. On the other hand Sherlock Holmes can only survive in this life if he is chasing his own love in the person of Irene Adler and sexual contact can only be submissive on Sherlock Holmes' side. Irene will take advantage of him sexually when he has been reduced to passivity by some kind of soporific drug and Sherlock Holmes loves it and he will go on running after her and he will only get the satisfaction of holding her tight to prevent her from being cut in two lengthwise by a belt saw. That's only utilitarian physical contact whose sexual dimension has been evacuated by the danger. And the key to his liberation is under the cushion for sure but he is handcuffed to the bed and as nude as a new born baby with all his hairs standing up on their roots when the chamber maid arrives. This homo-friendship is exactly what Walt Whitman described so well in his poetry, particularly in his Calamus songs. The attraction between two men that makes them partners in life for some active and material objective with no sexual dimension and with two women around them who are making them dream of sex and run after their skirts but who have to bring them together regularly for their sexual energy to be reloaded by some adventure against some criminal, like Moriarty. Beautiful modern film that is talking to us of the emotional relations between people, man and man, woman and woman, man and woman, woman and man, in a very harsh world slowly edging towards fascism but always avoiding this deadly end. The most extreme advocate of eugenics and social Darwinism was H.G. Wells at the end of the 20th century: the only non Caucasian whites who were tolerated were the Jews provided their intermarried, and all alcoholics, mentally and physically handicapped people had to be gotten rid of. Hitler was only different from that objective as fort his position about the Jews. That's the society that is reflected in this film but from an iconoclastic point of view that is praising emotional relations between beings as founded on nothing rational, just love. And don't forget you can and must love your worst enemy.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDfferent from that objective as fort his position about the Jews.

B000NTPDK0|5.0|\\"The Queen\\" (2006) is a wonderful, fascinating movie with a great script, superior cinematography, and great acting by Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and by Michael Sheen as a toothy Tony Blair. It's all about the death of Prince Diana, the royals' reaction and behavior after her death and the way the public in an outpouring of grief turned their wrath against the royal family believing them to be indifferent to her death.<br />Looking back, the paroxysms of grief that were displayed by the public now seem excessive. Viewing the movie now, I think viewers may be slightly more sympathetic toward the Queen.<br />The movie portrays the royal family with Prince Philip, Elizabeth's husband (expertly played by actor James Cromwell) as a mean-spirited and nasty man who always has to put his oar in. The Queen Mum (in a brilliant piece of casting played by Sylvia Syms) is cold-hearted. Prince Charles is ineffectual, weak, and bungling. The Queen shows her disdain for him and has some nasty cracks to make about her playgirl sister Margaret.<br />All of this, of course, involves guesswork and supposition by the screenwriter since few were privy to what went on in the royal establishment. When Diana died, the royals were ensconced in Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Callous Prince Philip took the boys (Prince William and Hall, not portrayed in the movie) out hunting for a stag during the mourning period.<br />The Queen and royals remained in Balmoral while the public seethed. The movie shows the newly elected Blair benefiting from the furor and shows him imploring the Queen to show some consideration for her subjects who wanted her to be almost mourner-in-chief. Finally Blair convinces the Queen that the media is after her head, and the public is turning against the monarchy.<br />Through all of this Helen Mirren does a masterful job of making the Queen a flawed but real and human person.<br />Newsreel footage is used with great skill. It's an engrossing look at the royals. Elizabeth drives herself around the huge Balmoral estate, and she sees a beautiful stag. The symbolism of the stag is not completely clear, whether it shows Elizabeth's reaction to her predicament, whether it's Diana, or whether it shows that she values animals above human beings.around the huge Balmoral estate, and she sees a beautiful stag.

1591843162|5.0|FULL DISCLOSURE: I made a donation to the Acumen Fund to get an advance copy of this book.    FULLER DISCLOSURE: I would have donated twice as much to get it that much sooner because it's that powerful.    This is not a marketing book, though few of Seth's last books really felt that way.    This is a book about becoming indispensable, about becoming a linchpin. However, reading the book is not like reading the map; read the book and become a linchpin-in-training.    In thinking about it, especially because such a large portion of the book is dedicated to gifts, this books is really Godin's gift to anyone that is willing to read, to question themselves, to take the steps to become a linchpin-in-training. As I read through the book, constantly highlighting and dog earring pages, it became clear to me that Godin didn't have to share the information in the book -- he certainly didn't need to share everything in the book. Of course, had he left out any bit of information that he included, then he wouldn't have been practicing what he preached; he wouldn't have given away all of the knowledge that can help you succeed with no expectation of financial gain (sure, he'll make some money from the price of the book and maybe get some speaking engagements, but he could have provided so much less and still had the same outcomes, which makes the book itself a perfect example of the content of the book).    You might be surprised to hear that you'll learn a lot about yourself when reading this book, provided you can beat down the resistance that you may have to doing so. I'll admit that I raced through the book the first time I read it, underlining good quotes and points, but not really applying the knowledge to myself, not engaging the introspection that I should have. So I read it again. Because the resistance was to write a review quickly (which I could have) and not absorb and live the information -- I pushed against the resistance and did it the \\"hard\\" way, which ultimatelywas the more valuable way.    Ultimately this book is about helping you discover the artist that's already inside of you, to create art. As Godin defines it: \\"Art is a personal gift that changes the recipient. Art is a personal act of courage, something one human does that creates change in the other.\\" This books makes you think about all the ways you can become great at creating art; linchpins, ultimately are artists.    If you're looking for the map on how to do all this stuff, how to be an artist, then, as Godin says: \\"Here's the truth that you have to wrestle with: the reason that art (writing, engaging, leading, all of it) is valuable is precisely why I can't tell you how to do it. If there were a map, there'd be no art, because art is the act of navigating without a map.\\"    PS -- if during reading (or even before reading) you want to give up (or not start), look on page 101 of the hardcopy version; don't be at the confluence.
B002VECLVY|4.0|\\"A Single Man\\" (2009) is a well-intentioned movie I very much wanted to like, but it wouldn't let me completely embrace it because of the pacing of the movie and the ennui of the central character. Don't get me wrong. It's very much better than many other films out there. Colin Firth plays a college professor, George Falconer, age 52, who eight months later is still depressed over the death of his male lover of some sixteen years. He has decided to commit suicide.<br /> This is well-acted film with ponderous, irritating pacing. The photography is arty, mannered, and showy. It has some phony flashbacks and occasionally uses slow motion and extreme close-ups of faces (the secretary's, for example) that seem oddly out of place. It's almost as if some novice got a hold of a camera.<br /> It's a downer of a movie. The protagonist's depression, at times, becomes boring. It's the early sixties so he is basically closeted. It's the Cuban missile crisis when the media is playing up the fear of nuclear annihilation and people are talking about bomb shelters. The one time when this English professor becomes publicly animated and passionate is when he changes to the topic of the atmosphere of fear of minorities when he's supposed to be lecturing on Aldous Huxley's \\"After Many a Summer Dies the Swan.\\"<br /> He goes around in a daze. It's walking a difficult line; trying to portray someone depressed without losing your audience. Watching depression can become depressing. The movie left me somewhat dazed, hoping for something a little better, perhaps more daring. The character is numb, and I'm afraid, at times, the audience is numbed. It's based upon a groundbreaking 1964 novel by openly gay Christopher Isherwood.<br /> Still, this is a movie worth seeing. Groundbreaking in its own way. I'm glad I saw it.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This latest \\"Emma\\" is perfectly cast, with a script that was written with insight rather than kid gloves, and is all-in-all far better than the Paltrow or any other screen version.  Bravo! Brava!  And that about says it all.

0399230033|5.0|My 18 month old loves this book!  We have worn out our old one and are on our second copy.  It is a fun board book without many words, but lots of opportunities for your own sound effects, especially a gasp on the page that is all black except for a pair of surprised eyes.
1591843162|2.0|Ok, this isn't a \\"bad\\" book, but half of the time in reading it I felt like I was re-reading the same phrases and thoughts over and over and over again.  Yes some repetition is good to help you remember, but this seemed to go overboard.  The main message that I got out of the 50% I read was put your whole effort and being into your craft (i.e. profession) and conduct it so remarkably that you're looked at as indispensable in your field.  To me, it was more of the same thoughts as we've seen in most any other book on success, perhaps packaged in a slightly different manner.<br /><br />I really don't get what all of the 5 star reviews are about.  If you still want to read it, check it out from the library before dropping money on it.  I wish I had.

B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I was not a fan of Michael's until I saw his movie in Oct.   I was so blown away by it that I had to get this music.  I've listened to nothing else since.  Absolutely FABULOUS! And what a great deal from Amazon.  Now I've bought the movie from them too!  But I had preordered it from them and knew it was being shipped by them on the release date.  But I couldn't wait...so I bought one from the store and then received my other from Amazon in the mail!  But the movie and the music is so good, I'm thrilled to have 2!
B000001ZS3|5.0|I received my first copy of Oxygene on a cassette tape in 1981 at the age of 11. It was like nothing else out there, and I loved it. It influenced my choice of music from that moment on. Today I still listen to electronic music, Dance, House and Trance our my favorites. I bought this copy, not only because it was on CD, but because I heard one of the top DJ's in the world use one of the tracks during a recent set................It never gets old. Get it, Enjoy it.

B002QH2NUA|5.0|A wonderful journey from past to present. I loved Paul telling how they felt arriving in NY and Shea and the splicing in of old film with the 2009 concert was fabulous! For all of us who lived through that era but were never privy to attend any of their performances this is a real keepsake.    The band is very talented and in many cases their musicality is better than the original band. To be fair, it may be that the sound is so good compared to the almost primitive stuff used in the 60s that there is no comparison. But these guys are giving their all for Paul and it must be an unreal experience being able to play with such a legend.    As a former drummer who had a band in those days, I couldn't help but bring out the sticks and play along. There are a lot of softer moments that play to Paul's old fashioned side, but when he wants to turn it on, he can still ROCK!    For a Baby Boomer like me or young kids curious about the Beatles, this will give you a glimpse of history and a mix of the present. There may not be many more nights and albums like this, as Paul won't be around forever. But yes Paul we still love you when you're 64 ( or 65 or 66....)!
1846683130|4.0|Gawande makes a convincing case for a well-designed checklist lowering or eliminating the dependency on individual expertise and varied circumstance. The part that impressed me most was his argument that checklists designed the right way can dynamically change team performance by dispersing power away from the central authority figure (such as a surgeon).     But Gawande also has a bit of Malcolm Gladwell Disease(tm), in which he tries to make too much out of his own cleverness in everyday things. For example, he acts surprised to learn about project management methodologies such as those used in skyscraper construction, which depend heavily on checklists. I can believe those ideas have never seen the inside of an operating room, but given the bureaucracies Gawande has worked with, is project management really new to him?     He sometimes has that same annoying Gladwell-esque gobsmacked narrative of \\"I can't believe I (and, by 'I', I mean you, Dear Reader) was too stupid to see the truth and wisdom smacking me in the head\\".  Needless to say, Gladwell fans will love it, and for good reason: like Gladwell's writing, Gawande's is a smooth, accessible style, just enough to provoke reflection while staying attentive to the flowing text.  Unlike Gladwell, his writing is never smug, and Gawande is clearly motivated by a profoundly human issue (safe surgery).  I imagine there will be a host of David Allen fans (such as myself) implementing Gawande-inspired checklists among their teams.
B002TVQ4GW|5.0|One of the best films of 2009.  Behind AVATAR, STAR TREK and MOON.  This is a rare breed of film, almost unlike any other where I had to immediately re-watch the film to fully appreciate and savor all the unexpected twists and turns.  Also, the film is a gem for the fact that only at the end does one realize that what you think you have been watching has in fact been a 'trick' and that the story was telling you something else all along.  One of the recent reviewers on Amazon stated that he didn't understand what the film was really about.  But the clues are all there.  The name of the 'ocean liner' that the characters hitch a ride on is worth paying attention to.  It ties in directly with the reveal at the end of who or rather 'what' kind of person 'Jess' really is.  A work of genius.  Must be seen in Widescreen.  Blu-ray if possible.  I would say more but that would spoil it.  Enter the Triangle to see for yourself and be changed forever...

B001U9BRNE|5.0|Hit Man is the best Blu-ray concert I have ever seen. It's really like being there at the concert with the Best Seat In The House. If this is the only Blu-ray DVD that you buy you Will NOT be Dissappointed. I never realized David Foster was involved with all of these artists and that he wrote or co-wrote all of these songs.
0385504225|5.0|First Dan Brown took on the Catholic Church in \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". In this exceptional suspense-thriller he takes careful aim at the Freemasons - \\"...not a secret society, but a society with secrets...\\" and weaves his story-telling skills around the symbols of the Masons and architecture of Washington DC. Throw in a threat to National security, an ominous figure with a twisted personal history, and some authentic sounding science, with twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your chair, and you have a winning formula for this page turner.<br />Recommendation: Start reading it early on a day when you plan to do nothing else, as you will find yourself reading all day.

But I have unique tastes I guess, and sometimes I don't \\"get\\" the hype about some things that people rave about. This thing made me smile so hard, MY FACE HURT!  This was a delightful love story - well, three delightful love stories - flavored with a dash of \\"don't give up on your dream,\\" and a hint of \\"only those who really TRY fail.\\" I supposed I am just enough of a romantic, I am in love with these characters!  A must see!
B001QOGYFO|4.0|this is a great suspense/thriller movie. there was great acting, and it had a very good story line. it's about a lone u.s. marshal in Antarctica, and she finds a dead body and now she has to race against time to find the killer before the last plane takes off before the massive storm.  the only thing i didn't like about this movie is the fact that she was the only law enforcer there.(not even close to being true)
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|This is a great movie for those kids who loves robots. It has a nice story line and you can easily fall in love with any of the characters. The jokes are not too bad either. Watch it as a family, it will sure to please.

B001DEXDNI|4.0|I once heard a rumor that Aretha Franklin once paid Annie Lennox the ultimate compliment of declaring her one of \\"the best soul singers I have ever heard.\\"  I could very easily believe that this is true.  The vocal talents of Annie Lennox, ranging from ethereal to playful to soaring, are rarely bestowed.  And this album's fourteen tracks are a fantastic \\"sampler\\" of her virtuosity.      My problem, like the other reviewers, is lack of completeness.  While this album is most assuredly worth the money, the absence of works like \\"Hush, Hush, Hush\\" and the agonizingly beautiful \\"Into the West\\" leave an unfilled hole.  And more, I would also like to see a Lennox anthology that includes her work from the film \\"1984\\" like the hard-edged \\"SexCrime\\" and the breathtaking \\"Julia.\\"      Still, it's Annie Lennox, a woman, in my opinion, who is a \\"Prima Diva\\" in the old, best sense of the title.  Lovely work, dazzling voice, unbelieveable range.      Recommended, but I still want my complete collection!
B000002UA2|4.0|This record is an astonishing document of that suspended moment in time, just before rock's Great Divide in the mid-1970s, when a punk and New Wave underground would begin to render acts like Pink Floyd perpetually unhip, and all the more so when albums like Dark Side of the Moon would find a grotesque level of commercial success and be warmly embraced by the Dazed and Confused set. This would shortly be my stoner older brother's music, played on eight-track tapes in his orange hippie van, and, for years, I wouldn't be caught dead hearing it. But, take yourself back to the time this was first released, and for a brief, shining moment, prog rock, glam rock, art rock, bubblegum pop could all stand side-by-side. Look at this cover art and listen to this music. The vibe is actually uncannily similar to the early solo work of Brian Eno, but there are also pop songs interspersed here that wouldn't have sounded out of place on a Todd Rundgren album. And, for a record by a band that was about to become a commercial behemoth, this is very heady, art stuff, without a whiff of sell-out about it. Impressive musicianship with admirable integrity, and it only loses a star for the utter lack of irony that seemed to have plagued most of Pink Floyd in its post-Syd Barrett phase. Barrett is a post-punk hero because he was funny and clearly having a lark overturning the rock-and-roll furniture, while Waters and Gilmour were a little prone to take it all a bit seriously. By the time of The Wall, they would be almost insufferably self-important. But that doesn't detract from the timeless beauty of the music they created here.
B0030U1TA2|4.0|REVISED 8/1/14 FOR CD/BLU-RAY REMIX/REISSUE:<br /><br />One of Gentle Giant's underappreciated albums gets the deluxe treatment. Steve Wilson (of Porcupine Tree and who has done a series of marvelous remixes for bands like XTC and King Crimson)has tackled the \\"The Power And The Glory\\" in both CD and a beautifully done 5.1 remix. When I interviewed Derek Shulman a couple of years ago he mentioned they were working an animated video to go along with this album I wasn't aware that it would be for a 5.1 Blu-ray remix at the time.<br /><br />The DTS 5.1 mix is exceptional sounding giving additional detail, depth and sound stage to the album. The Blu-ray also features animated segments tied into the theme of the album and compliments the music.<br /><br />We also get a flat transfer of the original stereo tracks on the Blu-ray as well as the instrumental backing tracks with screen saver. All of these are at 96/24 LPCM. The single/title track \\"The Power And The Glory\\" is included for the Blu-ray remix as well as the CD.<br /><br />The CD sounds very nice as well with solid dynamic range and Wilson's remixes remain very faithful to the originals although some new detail does creep in now and again and the resolution is improved over the original analog mixes. As mentioned \\"The Power And The Glory\\" IS included as a bonus track as well as the instrumental out-take of \\"Aspirations\\".<br /><br />I'm not a fan of cardboard digipaks (although they are improved if they have a sleeve to house them in). This does not include a sleeve although it is a tri-fold digipak with a booklet included. The booklet features new comments from members of the band about the making of the album integrated into an article by Sid Smith (well known to King Crimson fans)as well as photos of the band in action. The lyrics are not included in the booklet.<br /><br />There have been some complaints about how tight the hubs are for the CD and Blu-ray. Evidently, those from the UK are less of a problem to get out (this edition is made in the U.S. if you are ordering it from Amazon--how can you tell? The U.S. CD and Blu-ray have FBI warning printed on the outer edge of the discs). Mine are pretty tight and the ordinary method of pushing on the hub to get it to release the disc took quite a bit of effort to the point I was afraid I might crack one of the discs. Be careful taking them out and, if you have the same problem I did, I would store them along with the booklet in a traditional CD or Blu-ray case (depends on where you want to store it of course).<br /><br />Altogether this is a handsome presentation of a classic and underappreciated Gentle Giant album. Although I would have preferred a traditional CD case, the carboard case looks quite nice but I would store it carefully as it will show wear and tear.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />The 2009 Alcuard Reissue CD review below:<br /><br />A vague concept album inspired by Graham Greene's novel of the same name (that focuses on the abuse of power, religion and corruption) \\"The Power and the Glory\\" followed in the wake of the band's \\"In A Glass House\\". Unfortunately, the band had lost some of its momentum in the U.S. when Columbia Records (their U.S. label)elected NOT to release \\"In a Glass House\\". With a new label (Capitol at the time), \\"The Power and the Glory\\" managed to skirt the bottom end of the charts.<br /><br />The remaster from Alucard (the band's own label)in some ways improves on the DRT; \\"Glory\\" doesn't sound quite as harsh here as on that reissue (the original Capitol release sounded extremely good with a smoother analog feel). Fred Kervorkian has used some compression and different e.q. choices on this remaster. The resulting album is something of a compromise with better, richer detail than before but the use of specific band compression also means that the CD sounds less \\"natural\\" than the previous Capitol version. Dynamic range is mostly kept in tact which is a good thing and the remaster isn't brickwalled as many remasters are. There is limiting applied as well as some denoising (at the request of the band) but it isn't as obtrusive as I thought it would be. The best comparison I can think of is that this shares a lot of assets and drawbacks as The Beatles remasters.<br /><br />The one drawback is that this reissue along with the others that were previously on DRT have had all the bonus tracks removed. For some albums such as \\"Free Hand\\" that might not be all that big a deal since they were live recordings but \\"The Power and the Glory\\" DID feature the previously withdrrawn title trackthat the band had recorded under duress as a possible single and for possible inclusion on the album. If it HAD been released when this album was, I suspect \\"Glory\\" would have sold better since the title track has a catchy riff and melody that would have earned it airplay on FM and perhaps even some AM radio stations at the time. Eliminating that track from this reissue was a mistake even if the band felt it wasn't a great song.<br /><br />Overall the sound quality is pretty good for a reissue particularly in light of what passes for a \\"remaster\\" today with harshly compressed, dynamically squashed sound. Even if this edition of \\"Glory\\" is missing the bonus title track, this version is an improvement on the DRT with much better e.q. choices and a less harsh sound. The detail is crisper, sharper here than the Capitol version of this CD which more than likely didn't use the original mastertape (this reissue does). All hype aside (there's hype on the back of this about it being mastered at 24 bits but the album still had to be dithered down to smaller bit size for Redbook CD), this does best the DRT and in my humble opinion does sound better than the Capitol version even if that verion is warmer sounding simply because a better source tape was used for the mastering.<br /><br />Cautiously recommended because of the missing bonus tracks. \\"The Power and the Glory\\" isn't Gentle Giant's finest album but it holds up remarkably well 35 years later.n't brickwalled as many remasters are.

6304297912|3.0|While a gross-out scene may be the most memorable part of this film, it does paint a pretty realistic portrait of highly disorganized young heroin addicts. I've known a lot of heroin addicts in the course of my career (none in Scotland, however) and only a few of them were as far gone in their addiction as the young characters of this movie. While most make some very bad choices on a regular basis, few would go as far as this film suggests.
B0030U1TW0|5.0|Gentle Giant got a one-two punch to the gut; the oldest of the Shulman brothers Phil left the band but the band carried on as a five piece and produced one of the finest albums they ever made \\"In a Glass House\\" only to find their record label wouldn't release it. With \\"Free Hand\\" they regrouped producing one of their most confident, melodic and complex albums. This remaster improves on the DRT remaster from five years ago and is only flawed by not having the bonus live track that release had.<br /><br />As for the mastering engineer Fred Kervorkian did what's called \\"selective band compression\\". Yeah, there is selective band compression applied but the album sounds surprisingly good and isn't brickwalled More importantly, detail and clarity are an improvement over previous editon of the album. There is limiting applied as well as some denoising (at the request of the band) but it isn't as obtrusive as I thought it would be. The best comparison I can think of is that this shares a lot of assets and drawbacks as The Beatles remasters.<br />This edition does sound better than the DRT.<br /><br />Why no bonus tracks? I suspect it has to do with the fact that the GG label Alucard will be releasing these reissues on vinyl later this year (2010) and that the band wanted the CDs to reflect the original albums and the forthcoming reissues. \\"Free Hand\\" along with \\"In a Glass House\\" and \\"Octopus\\" represents GG at their finest.<br /><br />This reissue bests the DRT in terms of sound with much smoother e.q. choices.

B001HZ9ABM|5.0|Having purchased all the previous Bee Gees' Rhino re-issues (with bonus tracks) I was eagerly awaiting this triple CD set....and on the whole it's a great collection, as with all the Series it's superbly remastered and has a wealth of Demos and unreleased tracks...     After Bee Gee's 1st, Idea and Horizontal - Odessa sees the Bee Gees' talent with songwriting in the 60's at it's creative peak - I would liken their run of 60's albums to the run of albums from The Beatles from an almost identical time period - Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt Pepper's and their creative peak The Beatles (White Album)...     I mention this because as with the White Album, Odessa can be a little confusing and simplistic on first listen, with only the title track and several well known singles of initial interest....then, over time, the album as a whole grows to be a fully fledged musical classic with real depth and contrast....listen to it late at night with headphones and enjoy!

B001HXG8PK|5.0|My son and I are huge fans of The Dark Knight movie and as soon as he saw this available to purchase, he knew right away that he wanted to have it for his collection. So, when it was brought to my attention that amazon had it for sale, I ordered it for him. Now we both can enjoy the music from The Dark Knight.

B002ZG997M|5.0|After seeing this movie twice, I am still amazed at the symbolism and double entendre used to convey thoughts about our waning humanity and disregard for our earth.  I highly recommend seeing this movie with friends who enjoy analyzing the meanings implied in the movie.  It makes for great discussions about society.  While most people focus on the use of the Bible as the object of interest, you can replace it with any other books of knowledge (Koran, Torah, etc.) and the movie loses none of its messages.  Turn your attention to the relationships, the moral lessons presented, what can happen when humans are isolated, and more importantly, the order of power when selfish people control our limited resources.  This is a treatise on what can happen if we do not pay attention to the signs of our day: our children 'graduating' from high school unable to read, weather changes, iran with weapon grade uranium, wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. If we do not make rapid effective changes in our approach to dealing with each other and our environment, we will sadly leave a world like that depicted in this movie to our children.
B000001FQI|3.0|Further from the eighties TFF strode, the more they had to compensate sheer memorability with overproduced arrangements, starting here in lovingly crafted, sometimes hollow and self-important expression.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Most have felt the surrealistic sensibility of this film. Yet, wasn't it that way with the films of Cocteau? And, wasn't it Cocteau who named a film about a painter (and himself and art in general) 'The Blood of a Poet.' So why do I say poet-filmaker? Well, in a broad sense we could say that all film is literature, but most film deals heavily with the development of plot (narrative). And what can a poet throw out? This very thing for the purposes of pursuing the freest figurations and self-expressions. Of course, when events are placed in a sequence, we can always call the cohesive (enough anyway) flow of 'events' plot. Yet, when, whether or not the 'events' have taken place on the same universe (as the prefix 'uni' implies that the various states cohere in some way and operate under the same fundamental laws) what we have is something other than narrative in a film operating as the cohesive thread. There is no getting to the bottom of this film. If an artist could 'say' or show something without doing the art, art would never be created. Anyone that has studied Shakespeare understands that ambiguity is one of the most powerful means of evoking meaning. It is the spectator who will have to untie these intricate knots. The ambiguity is then, an invitation. Perhaps the most ambiguous film yet produced is a grand triumph for the fans by virtue rather than in spite of its absolute resistance to claims of finding resolution & closure.   Yet there are enough lurid parallels to invoke the spirit of an initiated viewer's 'visionary reading.' So? We provide the thread, but without the medium we wouldn't want to. I've been out on my porch thinking, 'I'm on to this Eraserhead thing now.' Then I get curious and turn on the movie only to find that my abstractions are once again blown away by the particular forms, sounds, imagery, language, in short, everything that Lynch has at his disposal (he uses it all well and considers it carefully. Man, aren't those Fats Waller organ pieces perfect!). And I think that present film-makers would do well to learn from Lynch and Cocteau as well. Let's face it: film can appeal to our senses and sensibilities in so many ways that we can be moderately 'entertained' by unambitious trash. But, as for making an art of it, the only filmmaker I can think of that consistently produced movies of this caliber is Fritz Lang. And he new well how to use image--if not surreal, certainly not ordinary. 'Video' in Latin means 'I see.' And for today's film-makers, this mostly means very mundane things. The vast majority of films being produced are hardly worth calling mediocre because it is actually disgusting that billions of dollars are being spent on them (to make and to view).  Alas, people even like them. The 'video' that is 'I see with my intellect' and will reveal with imagery more akin to the the mind's eye is a rare thing to pull off. It's hard enough to find a movie with good acting and a decent plot that is not so hackneyed that I want to vomit. Though I earlier compared Cocteau to Lynch, I think Lynch has far exceeded Cocteau. As for Lynch's other films, the one most akin to this by virtue of its highly 'poetic' revelation is Inland Empire. I highly recommend it and believe that Lynch was very brave for creating a film that he knew would very likely displease even many of his fans. I recommend giving I. E. a chance. It can be painful at first, but I've learned when to watch it (it's definitely not every night, and it's far from pleasant). Everything Lynch has done (with the exception of Dune) is worth owning and watching several times a year for me. Lynch digs pretty deep into thematic explorations that sometimes span several projects, and I don't think after Blue Velvet the sadistic man ever really left his mind. I mention this because the spirit behind Eraserhead was growing from '70 (and probably before). A great treasure is the release of The Short Films of David Lynch. Whereas with Twin peaks you can seestrong parallels with Blue Velvet, there's not much for Eraserhead. But the Grandmother and the Alphabet, though short, place this film in a slightly larger context.

0812548094|4.0|This was a great follow up to the first book and all of the characters I fell in love with were back in this follow up.  What I like about the books in this series is there is the master plot that goes across all of the books, while each book on its own is a great read alone.
B000002KBU|4.0|Utterly enchanting female folk can hang with the best singer-songwriter material of its era and beyond.
B002BW7A58|5.0|I think alot of people thought they would hear some Carter III type songs on this release and if you go into it looking for that type of sound you won't like it. He basically took Kid Rockz style and perfected it. This is the best rock/rap album I have heard in a long time. Every song is a straight banger. It's nice to see an artist step out of their true element and still be able to kill it. For people who gave this album a one star, you don't know good music point blank. I found mulitple tracks I will listen to over and over again. Great release Wayne!!!!
B00005B58Y|3.0|3 1/2      This is a great old school release that of course mostly stays within predetermined confines but nonetheless contains some of the most gripping bop solos of the time.
0061968579|5.0|If you liked the story and you like Graphic Novels then you'll love this.  Its a great adaptation to a great story.
031606792X|3.0|If you're a fan of this series, you will need to read this book even though it's not as good as the previous installments.  The characters you love are present, though sadly some seem to go through a personality change and become less true to character. Some criticize this book for its storybook happy ending, which I'm actually OK with.  What I didn't like was the unbelievable resolution Meyer wrote in regards to Bella's parents. She wants you to believe that Bella's dad, a policeman no less, would accept Bella's immortality without questioning her physical transformation as well as the \\"adopted child\\" that looks just like her and who grows at a miraculous pace. Meyer's also wants you to accept that Bella's mom just happily goes about her own life without much contact or need to know what's happening in her daughter's life. I expected better in the handling of such \\"loose ends\\".

6305882592|5.0|I first saw this movie while in college in '72 or so.  I loved it and continued to watch it many time over the years; even trying to get my kids as enthused about it as I am (I so far haven't succeeded). It has it all youth, age; death, life; rich, poor; a movie that will take you by surprise and, if you let it,  and will have you laughing while singing the song of Cat Stevens.  A real clasic.

0810982862|4.0|I think that the general tone of many of the reviews, that the book feels unusually thin for a movie with the production depth of Avatar, is well-founded; overall, while it presents an overview of the art behind most of the movie, it's just that -- an overview. It feels a bit as if it were rushed out the door to get it into the stores as close as possible to the release of the movie, so that if the movie didn't do well, the books could capitalize on what interest there was before it slumped off and was pulled away by other releases. In fact, I noticed a major composition error -- in the large illustration of a Great Leonopteryx and Banshees in flight on pages 82-83, the compositor apparently got confused and mistook the greenish arc of Polyphemus in the background as the _ground_ and turned the image upside-down.    With the success of the movie, I strongly hope that there is a _much_ larger \\"Making of AVATAR\\" book that takes this book and raises it to the next level, talking about the evolution of designs from initial concepts to final imagery, with illustrations showing the steps in the process. This book is good, but it feels like a \\"Cliff's Notes\\" version of what I -- and, from the reviews, many others -- felt it should have been.
0805091742|5.0|This is my first Atul Gawande book and I don't want it to be my last.    Being more versed in aviation than I am with medicine or construction or investing, the idea of a disciplined work environment with a 'nothing left to chance' MO has been something I now realize I take for granted.  The stories from the emergency room are extremely compelling - the last three pages had my own heart throbbing.  And while the book does have many case studies and operating room anecdotes, Gawande smoothly teases out the challenges that exist for any organization experimenting with new technology or procedures and lightly discusses the surrounding philosophy.  The idea of a checklist is difficult to discuss without providing lots of social context.    That checklists are relatively new to medicine might explain why the book is written so optimistically and enthusiastically about other fields that use checklists.  However, it has to be remembered that, especially in aviation, checklists are only really good at preventing things that have already happened.  Talk of variances and 'chaos' in complex systems does come up in several places but Gawande doesn't quite connect the dots or talk about how a post-checklist-implementation world might cope.  Elaborating on checklists' weaknesses and opportunities for the tool to move even deeper into organizations (for organizational decision makers, perhaps) would make for a great sequel.    If you are even peripherally interested or involved with systems thinking and complexity, The Checklist Manifesto will feel very familiar.  Near the end, the author quotes medicine systems expert Donald Berwick: \\"Anyone who understands systems will know immediately that optimizing parts is not a good route to system excellence.\\"  If the connection isn't immediately clear I suggest you buy the book and read it.  You'll see.    I intended for this to be a quick, casual, and enlightening read.  Instead, I have almost a dozen pages tagged and lots of highlighting and underlining of concepts and conclusions that are insightful and valuable.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Love that there are 3 different workouts to chose from, ranging from easy to hard. Great how, if u keep up with it on daily basis, u can progress to harder levels in no time. Easy to work in before work.  With setup, warmup, workout, cool down, only 30 mins. if u need something quick and effective this works!! make it an everyday routine!!
080508990X|4.0|Book is great for toddlers and younger.  It is short enough to hold their attention as well as having colors that capture the eye.  The title is repeated on every page and depending on the tone of the voice you use when you read, also hold the childs attention..  The thick pages of the book make it easy for the child to grasp and help turn the pages.

B000093OU8|5.0|Great CD!  I have not heard this since the 90's and forgot how good it was.  Gary Moore is still in my top 10 favorite guitarists in the world!
B000093OU8|3.0|Gary Moore \\"Wild Frontier\\" is a great cd but needs a better job of remastering. The other remastered Gary Moore cds are great and play much louder than this cd. \\"Wild Frontier\\" cd only plays half as loud as the other remastered cds from Gary Moore. With 24 bit remastering available, there is no excuse for poorly remastered cds. So hopefully \\"Wild Frontier\\" will get re-released with better and louder remastering just like the other Gary Moore cds.
1933308087|5.0|Excellent book written by Jinny Beyer, a master of her craft.  It is a history of 4,000+ quilt squares: when each was first published, who published it, and the many names given to a particular square.  There are no patterns, per se, but the author explains carefully how to draft the patterns shown in the book using grids and the templates included with the book.  Also, line drawings of the squares are given which correspond with the photographs of each square.  Excellent book.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I've had several different brands and styles of headphones in my life so far [I'm 26 now]. I've used ear buds, Ipod style, Clip on, and even the big professional cushy ear piece style. Of all these, this is the pair I will inevitably return to. I've always found ear buds deliver the best sound, but HATE ear buds cause they just won't STAY in my ear. I like the strap over your head kind, but they don't give as good sound, as well as being really noisy to those around you, which is one of my main concerns with headphones, how loud they must be before the sound starts seeping out to be heard by others nearby. With these I get the best of 2 worlds, ear bud sound quality, but with a strap to hold them in place. A trick I use for further stability is to wear a hat over the strap, They are a flexible plastic that won't just break or give you a headache to do that. Another up side, my cd/mp3 players don't even need to be on half volume to be heard loud and clear, and by the time the volume is high enough to seep out, it's way too loud. These are SO cheap but SO much more effective then even the most expensive headphones I've ever owned.<br />So why do I ever own different ones? I'm pretty sure Sony is trying to phase out this quality style for whatever reason, so they're hard to find in stores amongst the gimmicky skull candy stuff out now and I have ONE big problem with these that probably won't apply to you so don't worry. My cat LOVES the rubbery wires, if left out I will, and have on 3 very frustrating occasions, come in to find them chewed to bits. I plan to buy a few pairs of these here on amazon and HIDE them when not in use, I can't bear to lose my favorite headphones..again.<br /><br />(2013)*I bought these in 2010 for $10 at Target, and when they got chewed up I bought 2 replacement pair here for $2.60 Total. I don't know where fifty-some dollars came from, they are not worth that price.
1421527618|4.0|I bought this book without expecting too much but the final conclusion is that it was definitely a good choice. It is simple yet interesting.     The idea of the main character having to fight the exactly same fight over and over again and suffering the mental stress of knowing that he is going to die every day, is really amazing. What can you do today in order to survive the next fight? How can little things change dramatically if you have to repeat them a hundred times? And don't forget the most important fact, the feeling that your are completely alone and without help.    I really recommend this book if you want to spent a little of your time reading something that will not let you down.
0618918248|4.0|I think this is the best book to question the biblical gods. Dawkins has a lot of good insight to share on the subject, and even though I don't completely agree with him 100% towards his material outlook, I do share his same feelings toward religion and the personal gods of those religions. I like how he didn't insult pantheism. He seemed to lay into the other main religions, though. A great source of material for anyone having to debate religious fanatics in their lives. I recommend this over Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens. Hitchens was too arrogant and you basically need a thesaurus when reading God is Not Great.
1416595554|5.0|Sashenka, I couldn't have left  it in the bookstore after having read the worldwide known Sebag Montefiore's Russian history books. I knew it, it was a good choice. Sebag Montefiore  is an accomplished historian and turns out to be also a talented novelist.  Sashenka is a beautiful historical novel with the added value of having an absolutely faithful historical background, which it makes it also a pleasant learning instrument.  It is the story of a woman, Sashenka, in Russia before and after the revolution.   The plot is divided in three parts.    Sashenka as a young girl, Sashenka as an important official figure in Stalin's regime, and the archival research of a young woman in contemporary Russia.  In this way, some passages are omitted, making the developing of the story more agile, and creating a growing sense of suspense between the second and third part.  One. Sashenka was born from a nouveau riche family. The household situation is discomforting and makes the young girl feel uneasy. Through an uncle, she learns about the ferment of the revolution and immaturely but passionately she throws herself into the cause.  Two. We find her married to an important man of Stalin's regime and she herself occupies a relevant political role. Sashenka has children and a serene life. The perfect high rank Bolshevik family. One day she does something unexpected. And everything takes a dramatic turn.  Three. We are in contemporary Russia, a student is asked to make some archival researches on Sashenka.  Since the beginning, the reader can perceive some sort of anxiety, like a crescendo. Then facts lead to a dramatic blast, followed by the silence and slowly a new life, and new windows are opened on the past. Some of those talk about love, devotion, and passion, some others about death, sacrifice, and fear.  In Sashenka, Sebag Montefiore develops the events on the setting of an accurate  historical background. At the beginning, it is easy to grasp the flavor of the preparation ground for the revolution thanks to the vivid descriptions of places, characters who certainly lived at the time, codes, methods, clothes, architecture, taverns, smell and noises.  And then the regime, the rigid system, the power, the hierarchy, the relationships among the men around Stalin, the reverence, the dread, and also the prisons, the tortures, and the bureaucracy. The intangible is given in a such dramatic way, that it comes natural to feel the terror of those years in all its aspects.  Particularly fascinating (and philologically reassuring) is the mingling of fictional characters with historical ones. There is an episode in which Stalin himself visits Sashenka's house.  The plot is intriguing, complex and smooth, the dialogues are well orchestrated, the shifting of the scenes has a good rhythm, the visual descriptions are precious, the characters' psychological introspection is articulated.  Wonderful compelling story, the story of a clever woman, sweet mother of two beloved children who lived in her beloved Russia, in one of the most dramatic changes in its history.  It could be a great subject for a movie.  Sashenka, the woman, followed me for days after I finished this Sebag Montefiore's novel.  It made my cry.

If you're feeling down, pop this sucker in the DVD player and the blues disappear!  No matter how crappy the mood, this is a sure cure.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|Only discovered this band about 3 and a half years ago, but like them very much. IN ABSENTIA was the first album I got into. I didn't like all of it, but I did like enough of it to want to 1) listen to the album again, and 2) hear their other albums. They've released two albums since I became a fan, and it sounds to me like they've come a VERY LONG WAY. The production, sound quality, and most important, the SONGWRITING have gone to a whole new level. I've lost interest in \\"concept\\" albums over the years, they always seem forced to me. But this album's a WHOLE DIFFERENT ANIMAL in the \\"concept\\" genre. I saw the concert in New York a couple weeks before hearing the album, and they were such a tight outfit, you'd almost believe they actually recorded the album doing LIVE TAKES as opposed to conventional recording techniques. Very smooth transitions from one song (or song-segment) to the next, some really dramatic ideas in the lyrical content, and some of the best arrangements that PT have ever put together.        The high point of the \\"concept\\" disc is the 11-plus minute track \\"Time Flies,\\" but other standout cuts include \\"The Blind House,\\" \\"I Draw the Line,\\" \\"Octane Twisted,\\" and the \\"concept\\" disc concludes dramatically with \\"I Drive the Hearse.\\" The four stand alone tracks on Disc 2 are equally well-produced and make a nice compliment to the \\"Incident\\" story of Disc 1. My personal favorite is \\"Black Cat;\\" and Disc 2 wraps up very nicely with \\"Remember Me Lover.\\"   Overall, the \\"atmosphere\\" of the album is a bit on the \\"dark\\" side, but underneath it all is the sense of adventure and the imagination that's always present in the best of what the progressive genre has to offer. It's put together so well, and so easy to follow that I'd even recommend this album to \\"non-prog\\" music listeners. Fine piece of work that deserves a lot of recognition.
B00003CXC7|5.0|\\"Rear Window,\\" of course, is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most glittering masterpieces, and the great thing about this DVD is that it goes a long way in showing us why. First, it presents the film in a beautiful new restoration, with glowing colors and crisp picture definition. Second, it provides a fascinating feature in the Extras section, describing how Hitchcock designed the set--one of the most ingenious production designs in cinematic history. It contains interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, including several of the neighbors on whom L.B. \\"Jeff\\" Jefferies (James Stewart) trained his binoculars. The featurette fills us with renewed awe at Hitchcock, one of the most meticulous directors ever as well as one of the most brilliant, and at how he could keep such myriad, tiny details in his head as he made this film.<br /><br />And the film itself? I can only add my few droplets to the oceans of deserved praise it has received over the last half-century. What perfect casting: like a master chef, Hitchcock blends the disparate styles of Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr into something delicious and unique. What superbly timed suspense: if your pulse rate doesn't exceed 200 beats per minute as Stewart listens to Burr's footsteps up the stairs, growing closer and closer in a measured beat, you need to see your doctor immediately. And of course the first appearance of Kelly, a breathtaking blonde beauty arising as if from a dream, will haunt you forever. If you've never seen \\"Rear Window,\\" you won't regret buying this DVD sight unseen. If you have seen it, I can't imagine you wouldn't want this DVD immediately for your collection.
B0014E9188|3.0|I have to admit, I'm more interested in THE INCIDENT and BLANK PLANET albums, but PT is a VERY TIGHT live combo, and always sound terrific. This concert video, for me, is a really entertaining overview of  some of the material they were doing ten years or so ago up to DEADWING. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's not interested in their earlier music.      PT has very a straightforward approach compared to other artists that fall into the progressive category: very clean production sounds, along with melodies and vocal stylings that are very smooth and well-crafted. They excel at composing arrangements that always do a nice job of showing variations in range, pitch, rhythm, and the ability to effectively switch from very soft & quiet to very heavy, powerful and loud. Their greatest strength, I believe, is this: there is never anything on a PT album that they cannot perform or reproduce in concert; I personally take great stock in how good a band is at such a thing. It's a very important trait in regard to being a good live band, and that characteristic is in full display in this video. I just wish they would release a video with more of the recent music being performed.
B00005AG7K|2.0|Will we ever get to see \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" the way it was intended to be shown? The film was shot in glorious, 60s-psychedelic color, but most people have never seen this version. Instead we get this junk: computer-colorized black and white garbage. There's no detail; everything is washed out and faded. It looks like it was shot with a cheap videophone and then dropped in a vat of bleach. What was planned as a series of celebratory music videos featuring some great new Beatle songs and tied together by skits with the thinnest of plots comes across as sloppy, amateurish and self-indulgent. There's no joy or excitement. This is unjust, and it's unfair to fans who would like to critically assess this film in relation to the Beatle oeuvre.    To be sure, Magical Mystery Tour was never a masterpiece, but anyone who has seen \\"I Am the Walrus\\" on the Beatles Anthology knows that this film is much better than is generally assumed. Somewhere out there is the original full color version of Magical Mystery Tour. Will someone please release it? My advice: skip this poor quality colorized version and hold out for the real thing. In the mean time, we'll just have to satisfy ourselves with the snippets that are available on the Anthology.

B0015DWLD0|4.0|Whether a book is a 1 star or a 5 star is a subjective opinion of the reader.  No one is right or wrong in their opinion.  Having shared that profound thought, I read with interest the reviewers that loved it and those that really didn't like it at all.  I definitely fall into the former category.  Four stars because:  I liked the author's writing style, the plot held my interest, I looked forward to getting back to it when I had to put it down, and it fell into my subjective category of a \\"good read\\".  Like most good reads, I thought it deserved 4 stars.  I save 5 stars for the best of the best.      On another note, I really enjoy the capability of reading a sample on my Kindle before I buy.  You get enough to at least get a sense of the author's writing style, which is huge for me no matter what the subject matter.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|I ordered this dvd for our 2 yr old grandson, as it is his favorite movie.  The price was great, it was in great condition and it arrived quickly.   Needless to say, our grandson was thrilled.

B00328R21C|5.0|(dictated by Emily's eight year old brother)    This Lego set is awesome. You have got to buy it. It stays together well and it's lots of fun. I think Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kanobi are cool.
B002VWONB2|5.0|Unlike the previous reveiwer, I know this is one of the best movies period, and very enjoyable to all ages. Bogarts performance was one of the best ever on the silver screne, the only draw back I can understand a new viewer is that its a little dated. But, the movie is a timeless classic. Look, don't read whats on amazon to make your oppion. Look on IMDB.If you think its an age thing Im 25; and the people I have had see it they all loved it and are under 26.
0131103709|5.0|This is a great reference, as well as an in depth look into the standard library.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Often a movie makes claims beyond it's reach, but when this movie says it's a cross between Superbad and Shaun of the Dead, it's not that far off.  While it doesn't have the dry British wit of Shaun, it does have the zombies!  Scarcely scary, this movie is full of laughs- who knew Zombies could be so much fun?!

0316044938|4.0|I have never ordered books from Amazon before. I was a bit apprehensive as to the service. It was much better than expected. My account was handled in a professional manner, with delivery of the product in a very timely fashion. I will certainly order more products from Amazon.
1439170045|5.0|A must read. While most would find the subject to be a \\"downer\\" this book does read like a memoir. A general look at life with Alzheimer's disease. For the marriage, person and grown children affected. A reminder that tommorrow is not promised and we need to live today to the fullest.  Wonderful work by a very talented author.
B001DDBCV4|5.0|Yes i have sat down and watched this series with my wife and this movie. And yes it is entertaining and i liked it. Now she has her blue ray and is getting refreshed and prepared for the sequel, lol.

0393075966|5.0|Joseph Stiglitz's book has lived up to my expectations.<br />I expected a coherent, insightful offering about the causes of the current crisis and how to correct them. Mr. Stiglitz does this in a way that an economics layperson can understand.<br /><br />The author explains various economics terms such as:<br />+\\"externalities\\"<br />+ The \\"Greenspan/Bernanke put\\" and how it effected the behavior of financial entities.<br /><br />Part of the problem is political. Campaign contributions have been a valuable investment for financial firms with a high return.<br /><br />Mr. Stiglitz has a critical view of president Obama's choices for his economics team. The recent past for these people doesn't instill confidence as they were involved to varying degrees in the crisis.<br /><br />Another opinion that I share is the double standard for Wall Street compared to the auto industry.<br /><br />A topic that the author addresses that doesn't get a lot of attention is the monopoly power that banks have regarding credit cards.<br /><br />A well-made point is the political hypocrisy regarding \\"socialism\\". \\"Socialism\\" is a dirty word in politics unless it involves socializing the losses of Wall Street at the taxpayers' expense.<br /><br />On page 291 Mr. Stiglitz makes a statement that sums up wide public sentiment-<br />\\" This crisis has exposed fissures in our society, between Wall Street and Main Street, between America's rich and the rest of our society.\\"<br /><br />This can be highlighted by the preferential tax treatment of the speculators on Wall Street over the working class laborers.<br /><br />The author touches on a wide variety of the social aspects of economics as well as some of the more famous economists and their theories.<br />Most important, the author offers some sober, but sensible solutions to prevent a recurrence of the problems and suggests who should bear the brunt of the difficult changes.<br /><br />This is a very readable book and one of the best available on the important subject of current economics. A must read!
0805091742|5.0|I measure a great book by how often I'm reading sections to my long-suffering wife/listener. Another indicator: I read the book slowly, tasty morsel by tasty morsel. Lastly, there's serious emotion when I turn the last page--somehow hoping it could go on and on. This book scores 10s on all counts.<br /><br />Really? A book about checklists is that good? Yes. If you enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's [[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]], you'll love this one.<br /><br />[x] 1. Atul Gawande, a surgeon and staff writer for The New Yorker, leads the World Health Organization's Safe Surgery Saves Lives program. If you didn't believe in checklists before, you'll be a born-again checklist-maker after Chapter 1.<br /><br />[x] 2. He quotes a 1970s study on \\"necessary fallibility.\\" It cites two reasons we fail at stuff: a) ignorance and b) ineptitude.  In the latter, \\"...the knowledge exists, yet we fail to apply it correctly.\\"<br /><br />[x] 3. Caution! If you're having surgery soon, or have friends or family facing the knife, you may want to skip this book--or ask your surgeon's views on operating room checklists. (In a recent global experiment, a two-minute pre-surgery team review of a standard checklist has dropped infection rates, death rates and complication rates by a staggering amount.)<br /><br />[x] 4. Pilots have long been the checklist gurus--but the art and science of well-crafted checklists have not found favor in other professions or industries...yet.  The Captain Sully story, though expected, still caused my heart to beat fast.  You'll appreciate how checklists saved the day for the \\"Miracle on the Hudson.\\"<br /><br />[x] 5. The chapter, \\"The End of the Master Builder,\\" takes you into the elite world of checklists created under the hardhats of McNamara/Salvia, a Boston high rise construction firm. The dingy construction trailer is long gone. In its place, \\"...on the walls around a big white oval table, hung sheets of butcher-block-size printouts of what were, to my surprise, checklists.\\"<br /><br />[x] 6. Checklists are \\"ridiculously simple.\\" What seems obvious, isn't.  Checklists enhance teamwork--even among virtuoso surgeons. \\"There's a reason much of the world uses the phrase, operating theater.\\"<br /><br />[x] 7. Boeing's checklist expert uses \\"pause points\\" when building checklists for pilots in crisis. Within each pause point, he limits the checklist to between five and nine items. I had no idea that there were checklist connoisseurs.<br /><br />[x] 8. For crisis lists, decide whether you want a DO-CONFIRM checklist (do what your gut tells you, then go back and confirm you did it) or a READ-DO checklist (more like a recipe).<br /><br />[x] 9.  Gawande interviewed the managing partner of a California investment firm who is a checklist zealot. He cited the \\"cocaine brain\\" that researchers often experience when investigating company financial reports. Without a thorough checklist (honed over years of experience), a greed mode kicks in and wipes out thoughtful discernment. They use a \\"Day Three Checklist\\" to avoid disasters. \\"Forty-nine times out of fifty, he said, there's nothing to be found. `But then there is.'\\"<br /><br />[x] 10. \\"Fly the airplane,\\" amazingly, is the first item on a checklist for engine failure on a single-engine Cessna airplane. \\"Because pilots sometimes become so desperate trying to restart their engine, so crushed by the cognitive overload of thinking through what could have gone wrong, they forget this most basic task. FLY THE AIRPLANE.\\"<br /><br />In one study of 250 staff members (surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses and others), 80 percent reported that the new checklist had improved the safety of care and 78 percent \\"actually observed the checklist to have prevented an error in the operating room.\\" Yet, 20 percent gave it a thumbs down.<br /><br />Then Gawande asked one more question, \\"If you were having an operation, would you want the checklist to be used?\\"  A full 93 percent said yes!
B0026P3G12|5.0|A cinderella set to music. A tribute to her lovely country of Ireland. Sincerety and feeling is projected in her voice when she sings. Besides being naturally talented she is an inspiration to all of us.
B0030GJ50C|5.0|Not what I expected... it was much better. I gave it 5 stars because I have never seen anything quite like it and I thought it was incredibly well done. Original, imaginative, gripping, not to mention bizarre. Just when you think it's all been done before, a movie like this comes along. Like \\"Pi\\" I'll probably never watch it again... once was enough... but I'm really glad I saw it and it will stick in my memory for a long time.
B002TVQ4GW|4.0|I'm not going to talk about the plot because it is something that needs to be watched and will be better with the less you know.    I thought it was an absolutely fascinating supernatural thriller. It is very complicated and doesn't make much sense at first and will leave you wondering long after the credits roll.    The look of the film is great and directed very well. I was very surprised that the cast were not horrible actors. Usually films like these fall burden too the fact that only the lead and maybe main supporting role put on good performances but I thought everyone did a great job, especially the lead.    The dialogue isn't amazing but it is made up by most of the brains of the script being put towards its complex and twisted structure.    It isn't overly gory yet the violence is still incredibly shocking.    I really liked the ending, it still leaves me wondering how some things happened and I really think it needs to be watched more than once. But I don't think the questions are enough to take away from the whole experience of the film.    Overall I thought it was an incredibly unique, complex, thoroughly entertaining, and a clever and very well made film. Unlike many horror films I didn't think this one feel apart at the final act and continued to surprise me right until the credits rolled. I think I would consider this one of my favorites which is saying a lot when considering how many horror films I actually like. Now I may not have found this to be as scary as Paranormal Activity I think all together it is a much better film and my favorite horror film of 2009, if it can even really be considered one. 8.5/10

B002Y0MQ6A|1.0|Don't recommend it. It will leave you depressed and wondering why you spent the two hours watching it.  You can find a better movie, or something of more value to do with your time.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|Modern film and good story play with new young actors ; film with connection in music with Beatles records in different way by new singers and actors from the film ; absolutely to watch. Only one regret no booklet in the special deluxe box set.
