0757302661|5.0|Seriously loved this book for the birth of our son. Because my husband and I both work full-time and he also attends school full-time we weren't able to make it to any birthing classes which had me worried bc the birth of my daughter did not go as I had planned (I labored for 39.5 hours). This time, however, we both read the book all the way through and I practiced the relaxation techniques daily we had the best birth experience EVER!!! This time I didn't go through the fear/pain cycle as I did with my previous labor and from start to finish it lasted just a little under 6 hours with no medications whatsoever. I would highly recommend this book to any expecting mother out there. I remember this labor and delivery as a peaceful, easy experience. I wish I could give this book 10 stars!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was insightful and intriguing. I was extremely proud to know how professional our Special Forces are trained and how dedicated they are in fulfilling their mission.  My congratulations to all Special Forces and Seals.

B000F3AB0Q|5.0|Gary Moore was a very special guitarist - he will be missed. I'd also recommend the DVD: [[ASIN:B00069YDWQ Gary Moore & The Midnight Blues - Live at Montreux 1990]] - but, can't think of any of his DVD's I don't like.<br />If you know Gary Moore, then you bought this and aren't bothering to read any reviews.<br /><br />If you don't know Gary Moore - I can attempt to calibrate him with some very subjective references.  I think his music is [rather than was I suppose]:<br />- softer w/more realistic phrasing and tone than Joe Bonomasa<br />- more personal than Clapton, and faster<br />- smoother and more intricate than Bloomfield<br />- deeper and more clever than Rod Price (Foghat)<br />- broader in scope than many<br />- I wouldn't put him in the class of Satriani, Morse, Vai, or Di_Miola<br />- but he was right at the next tier,<br />- not as creative as Vaughn, Gibbons, Landreth, or Verheyen, but every bit as skilled<br />- fun to hear him with Albert & BB King -  but I'll refuse to compare<br />- if you had to pick one album to define Blues to an Alien, you just might pick this one.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|The BluRay version begins with fight-action scenes like those in \\"300\\", amazingly up-close and very detailed in the pauses. The story-line continues from Spartacus and the gladiators escape and their beginning to work to free slaves and various nobles trying to capture him. By the 3rd episode relationships begin to gel and the plot starts twists and turns with surprises.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The details in this book are pretty graphic I read the book in less than two days I definately reccommend it
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I understand that the latest Kindle readers support original printed book page numbers. This item needs to be updated to explain how to format Kindle book files to include page numbers. Otherwise, this book is excellent in explaining the Kindle process.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Strictly off of my opinion, this movie was a overhyped reguritated Hollywood story about young love and violence.  It's setting was very strange, it started off in the District 12(that looked like it was an undeveloped third world country) and then came the spaceships.  After the selection, the kids get on a super technogolical bullet train with crystal chandeliers, tons of food, and....wait wait wait....WHAT!!!  It was remeniscent of a spin off of a sci-fi German Holocaust.  The first hour and fifteen minutes were painfully tetious, giving nothing but a boring dialogue of \\"how to survive\\".  An hour and 15 minutes in, thats when you start to see any sign of action...but by that time you will probably be asleep.  I read the first book, it was decently written, but they ruined the movie.  With some more book related changes this could have been corrected and made the movie decent, but still not worth buying. Do yourself a favor, instead of paying 20 bucks, rent it and see if you like it.  I know I was glad I did.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|First let Me say Thank You to The Seals. When You see this You will be able to sleep at night knowing they are on our side. The movie is a must see and was produced by Tom Clancy. It has action but also in My view more important the lost art of Story Development. The Actors and Seals made the story POP. The bottom line is the movie is a Best Picture.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I saw the movie in the theater loved it read the books three times cannot wait until the next one is released. And will buy that DVD when it is released.

B00992CF6W|2.0|I have this game for Pc.  love it. I now have it for kindle fire and I'm disappointed.  maps are small. survival mode has little resources.  I was stuck flying around on one map and had to restart.<br /><br />hope there's an update soon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|at first its hard to get a hold of the game in general but after you get used to it, its awesome!
0553807919|4.0|I thought this book was an interesting read. As a parent, I like to read all different kinds of parenting books. This book gives you a whole new perspective at understanding your child's behavior from a biological standpoint. The author describes in detail the different processes that take place in the brain during different scenarios of children's behavior - good or bad. The author also gives plenty of suggestions on how to deal with different kinds of behavior. Overall, I liked the book. I'm just wondering, how practical this author's approach is for a parent dealing with a toddler's temper tantrum in the middle of a supermarket.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! You have to get it. It has a perfect balance between surviving and creating. Even if you don't agree it's the best game ever, you will still have hours of fun playing it. A must get!
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|So beautifully done. And I LOVE both actors. Gorgeous settings and costuming, true tenderness in even the quietest moments between them.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This was so captivating- I was surprised. The social landscape of the times is well captured and the audience is spared no hard truth. You really feel each of the characters' troubles, strengths, longings, and imperfections, and see them adapt to their surroundings and circumstances. Couldn't turn it off.
0525953728|5.0|Really an excellent book about the US Navy SEALS and the work that they do.  There have already been a ton of reviews so let me just add a few comments:<br /><br />1.  I wish Mr. Bissonnette the very best, and the same goes for all the SEALS (past and present).<br /><br />2.  As an American citizen I can't - for the the life of me - see how this book does any harm to the special forces community.  I have probably read two dozen books by military authors (spec ops) from a variety of countries.  There is little or nothing in this book that compromises secure information - it fits in very well with similar books.  Hence the huge fuss from the Pentagon makes no sense to me at all.<br /><br />3.  I know one young man who wants to follow in the footsteps of the SEALS and Delta - and I have recommended to him that he read this book.  Therefore, I believe that Mr. Bissonnette has achieved his PRIMARY MISSION ... to encourage a new generation of young people to do their best and serve their country.<br /><br />4.  As a US citizen, is am pi**ed off about the Rules of Engagement (ROE) being given to our fighting men.  Why on earth are SEALS having to write PowerPoint charts to justify a mission?? Why are our special forces being asked to surround houses with Taliban fighters and ask them nicely \\"to come out and play \\" (my words).  Give me a break - this is friggin' ridiculous.  How did our politicians get their slimey paws into mission planning at this level?  Please let our warriors do their JOBS - or end the war!<br /><br />5.  It is possible that Mr. Bissonnette may feel the full legal fury of the Pentagon over this book.  If they slap him in irons - I wish him WELL.  It would be ironic that the Pentagon is jailing a guy who did more to boost their recruiting than anyone else this decade.<br /><br />Just my $0.02<br />This book is well worth reading!!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I worked in the defense industry for 20 years and was interested to find out exactly what this individual had to say.  I read the book quickly and found it a great read.<br /><br />The author took a lot of criticism for writing the book.  However in the book he describes actions on the part of others that he believed compromised the security of the individuals on this mission.  He did not seem in any way, to be a \\"Glory grabber.\\"  He constantly praised his fellow SEALs and emphasized the success of the mission being due to group effort.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|There is a ton of insight in this book to how devgru operates but there's nothing in here that the press didn't dissect in the days following the operation.  I really enjoyed the read.<br /><br />Thank you to the men and women who serve our country!
0545425115|5.0|Since everyone else has already written about the story, I'll just focus on the edition here.  It's a papper back and the content is the same as the other editions.  It's lightweight, and has that great book smell, though, since it's new, it doesn't have that musty book smell.  Either way, if you're like me and snatched this up for cheap, it's a great deal.
145162607X|5.0|Firstly, I should say that even though this book is part of a series, each of the books can be read as a stand alone. What I've really enjoyed about this series is that it takes place over the same time period, involving the same people and events but told from different perspectives/sides of the Cousins' War (also known as the War of the Roses). I love Gregory's knack for taking controversial topics in English history and writing elaborate, entertaining novels around her ideas. (Example: her next novel will be about what she thinks was the fate of the Princes in the Tower).<br /><br />I have read the other books in the series and had originally thought that I was on the Lancaster side of things, but this book has changed be into a Yorkist. One of the things I always find interesting in royal histories, especially English royal history is that one of the ways for men to attain their ambitions within court was to use their daughters as pawns. If a man could marry off his daughter to another man of power within the court, preferably a man close to the king, the entire family would rise. That remains the case with Richard Neville. He not only switches sides and makes enemies of his friends, he makes sure he places a daughter on each side so no matter which way things go down, he's set.<br /><br />The story is told from Anne's perspective and I really liked her. She's a bit whiny and naive, but through the course of the novel you get to see her grow from a child to a very shrewd and informed woman. I am still unsure how I feel about her sister Isabel. Part of me really wants to hate her, but she does have some endearing moments.<br /><br />Elizabeth Woodville (Anne's enemy, even when they are on the same side) is a piece of work. Though I had originally liked her in The White Queen I did not like her at all in this one. She just seems so evil to me now. Though what really gets me, is that Anne Boyelyn (who came a few generations later in history) gets harshly criticized in history, but she didn't do anything that Elizabeth Woodville didn't do. In fact, I think the later was much worse. And it goes without saying that Elizabeth had the kinder husband.<br /><br />There are a lot of twists and turns in the novel. It's hard to put down, especially if you are a fan of English history. It's a great stand alone and fits well within the series without being seeming over done. I can't wait for Gregory's next novel. She always fascinates me and her novels always seem worth the read to me.in history, but she didn't do anything that Elizabeth Woodville didn't do. In fact, I think the later was much worse.

0425263908|4.0|Erotic and intense...leaving you panting for more<br />Eva Tramell moved to New York with her best friend Cary Taylor to work at the renowned advertising agency Crossfire. Even before her first day at work, Eva literally stumbles into the billionaire owner, and sexiest man she has ever laid eyes on, Gideon Cross. She instantly feels the animal magnetism of him pull her in to the depths of erotic desire, leaving her craving more.<br />But Eva has a tragic past, an over protective mother, and a best friend who is just as damaged and broken as she is, that makes the titillating yet emotionally intense Gideon completely wrong for her. Despite her protests, Eva's desire for Gideon might be exactly what she needs, especially when he has skeletons of his own hiding in the closet. Gideon is used to power and control, but Eva is upsetting his normal routine and stimulating emotions in him that he has long since hidden deep within himself. Tumultuous and passionate, their fragile relationship develops as they try to fill a deep seated need that only the other can provide.<br />Seeking love and trust between one another, their relationship is intense, complicated, and emotional which creates the perfect setting for explosive and fantastic sex, that leaves the reader nearly as satisfied as Gideon and Eva. Sylvia Day has created an addictive read that promises to get even better.<br />One of the few issues I had with the book was the lack of resolve of the issues between the two characters. Sex was used as a Band-Aid, and while as fantastic as it was, the characters simply passed over issues without coming to any resolutions.<br />Readers looking for a Fifty Shades of Grey fix should not pass up Bared to You. While there are many similarities between the two books, particularly with the character types, they are two completely different plots with Bared to You having superior writing, better dialogue, and more creative sexual encounters.<br />The second book in this trilogy, Reflected in You is scheduled for release October 2, 2012.<br />baseballvalbooks.wordpress.comlected in You is scheduled for release October 2, 2012.<br />baseballvalbooks.wordpress.com
B000SEFNMS|5.0|It is an interesting true story - the perspective of some one on fire for living, whether or not one finds it insightful, worthwhile or wise--or not, I think it's an engaging read, in the least...
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book was marvelous.  I could not put it down.  I lived in Iran for several years and still learned a great deal about people who live in the middle east.
B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|It's a real stretch to enjoy action-chicks in a movie, but this is a bit more believable. Still, some of the fight scenes were poorly conducted/directed/photographed and others were perfect. The entire movie was uneven in that manner. The weaponry was top rate. The tech advisers and trainers knew their stuff.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|For a first time writer EL James took you on a nice journey of personal emotional growth of two very different individuals. I enjoyed seeing the story unfold and generally I don't love happy endings, but it was nice to see both characters wind up on the winning end of their emotional hardships with their relationship intact.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a great game. five stars for sure. good way to waste time waiting for stuff to happen. awesome.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|This is the just one of a number of RAM MOUNT products that I have purchased over the years.  These items are extremely durable and have always functioned exactly as expected.

0793518326|3.0|It's a good and complete book for all Beatles fans. It's got tabs for all instruments, guitars, bass and drum. For reference it's good but to play and read as you are playing, it's crap because of it's small size, 8.5'' X 11'' and it's scripted small too.

B001EC3JME|4.0|So I saw a lot of criticism on here about it not fitting the D-Cell flashlights. I am a Security Officer and decided to order this for my 3-D Cell Maglite regardless of what I saw about it not fitting. I received it yesterday, so it is new. I have to say, it is nice to walk around and not have the flashlight banging up against your leg all the time. This holster holds the flashlight securely. It is definitely tight, and you need two hands to get it out of the holder. I already noticed that it is loosening up slightly each time I check it for fit. When I put this light in the holster, I can not imagine it ever falling through the holder. The top of the flashlight is so much bigger around than the battery compartment. The swivel is somewhat flimsy feeling, but it does lock in place.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Fits Large Flashlights (3-D Cell Maglite)<br />Holds light securely to belt<br />Is not stretching too much for extreme wear<br /><br />CONS:<br />Definitely tight for this large flashlight<br />Needs two hands to draw/reholster flashlight<br />Swivel feels kind of flimsy, but does definitely lock at all the different angles<br /><br />I could not have asked for a better holster. WAY BETTER THAN THE FLASHLIGHT RING I WAS USING. If something happens to it soon, I will update the review. Otherwise, I strongly suggest this product!

B000A2RRF4|3.0|To call this a Michael Jackson concert is being generous. This is two hours of footage of MJ fans reacting to MJ. Absolutely maddening. I'm not kidding when I say that in a five-minute span, you will EASILY be cut to the crowd about 10-15 times. That's not an exaggeration. Absolutely frustrating. The three stars are for Michael and Michael alone. The parts I got to see were fantastic.

0470917458|5.0|Voet & Voet Biochemistry (4th edition) is a 1300 pp tome packed with detailed information about biochemical reactions, metabolic processes, the structure and function of biomolecules and much more. The book contains plenty of beautiful illustrations about the 3D structures of proteins, DNA, and their complexes, each with its corresponding PDB (Protein Databank) id code. Furthermore, each chapter ends with a long list of references to specific studies published in scientific journals. What can you ask more?
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a well written, easy read, however, you may not find much new information.  The author did a good job of not divulging sensitive information while telling an interesting story from boyhood to the raid.
0425238091|3.0|This novel was initially written as a catharsis for the author's bruised psyche that resulted from the inhumane working conditions that Interns of his generation had to endure. The cynicism, raunchy language and promiscuity were all relief valves to mitigate the pressures and oppression of the job...or so we are led to believe. If I had another slice of this baloney I shall suffer from severe indigestion.<br />I happened to be a surgical Resident during the period described in the book. I trained in some of the large urban teaching hospitals and have a pretty good idea of what generally went on. As anyone in the medical field knows, surgical training is the toughest as far as physical exhaustion and interminable working hours.<br />When I first read the book in 1979, I was already out of training. I found it then to be irreverent, intentionally shocking, outrageously funny in some parts, frequently whiny and woefully inaccurate. I thought that the author was a \\"nebish\\" (nerd in the modern parlance) who lived vicariously through the real or imagined adventures of other doctors, that were probably embellished via the gossip mill.<br />The book is a pulp fiction novel that depicts a mostly imaginary and biased perspective of a long gone era of American medicine and as such it is a fun read. But it falls short if taken seriously as a genuine account of an Intern's experience.<br />I just reread it and have not changed my opinion even with the moderating perspective of time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I had this app on my Blackberry and now on my Kindle Fire. Works great! Not only does it have many versions of the Bible but I can write notes for myself or share them with the community.  This is my favorite study tool.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I don't really get the fuss. There were a couple of hot sections but otherwise, the writing is embarrassing and the story-line is sexist and insulting. I'm sad for women who think of this as a fantasy. I definitely will not be reading books 2 & 3.
030758836X|4.0|This book was so intriguing that I've recommended it to others, not so much because I enjoyed it, but because I want to share the experience. I almost put the book down but only finished because I read enough positive reviews that I wanted to know how it ended. Neither of the main characters are likable, but I was left in the end with dissatisfaction over the lack of consequences for truly, truly, evil behavior. Was the marriage its own punishment? I don't have a book group. Amazon customers, what do you think?
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is perfect in every way,  except that you cannot download the NASB version. Before I got my Kindle Fire,  I had an ipod touch and the Apple version of this app let me download the NASB. I have used NASB to quite some time and don't plan to change. It is kind of frustrating to have a portable reading device, yet have to be tied to WiFi to read the Bible version I prefer. I hate the idea of paying for a NASB, not because I am cheap, but because reviews of Kindle NASB's make them sound inferior to this app. Add a downloadable NASB and I'll give you 5 stars. Add a downloadable NASB and I'll pay tor this app. Keep up the good work!  PS - I really enjoy the daily Spurgeon plan you offer.

B005PK1G76|5.0|I thought the parent console sold by Baby Jogger was overpriced, and so I selected this organizer. The price is reasonable, the cup holders are a good size, and the console fits our City Mini stroller nicely (hard to tell it wasn't made for it). Even better, it doesn't need to be removed when folding the stroller!
B006H5120E|5.0|This is a review of the Blu-ray not the movie itself.  It was watched on a 59\\" Samsung Plasma 3D television with a Samsung 3D Blu-ray player and a Yamaha 5.1 DTS receiver.  I've seen this film several times through the years on DVD.  If you are looking for a showcase for \\"pop-out at you\\" effects this is probably not it.  But the added clarity of the Blu-ray and the depth given by the 3D is absolutely astounding!  The first part of the film in particular, when the submersibles are searching the wreck, the added depth is incredible.  I found myself saying \\"wow\\" outloud numerous times.  I noticed a number of things I hadn't noticed before (including a reflection of the steady-cam as it approached one of the glass doors aboard ship).  The CG effects are slightly more noticeable on the Blu-ray but are not distracting.  The crispness of everything else makes up for it.  This was not a \\"rush and slap it on a Blu-ray\\" job.  This is a GREAT transfer!  And for us audiophiles it is a real treat as well.  From the great low-ends of James Horner's orchestrations to the ship breaking up around you it is bliss to the ears.  Even the subtle rumble of the ship's engines in the background is sweet.  There is an added bonus after all of the credits:  You'll be treated to an extended THX logo theme that will shake your house to it's foundation... in 3D of course.  This is a PERFECT showcase for a nice sound system.  Even without the 3D, this Blu-ray is definitely worth getting for the picture and sound improvement over the DVD.

B008VBYN80|4.0|I love the graphics and the battle modes.  This game is very similar to zyngas Empires and Allies in battles but requesting friends from Facebook for a kindle game is unrealistic.  I have yet to find a game where this works.  There are not enough people yet who own kindle fires so expect to have to pay some money in the higher levels to upgrade your army.  They give you one every level up but things cost too much. (blue diamonds)  If it gets too costly I will have to stop playing.
030758836X|3.0|the author is an astute observer and a very good writer--will definitely give her that. in terms of writing quality, the book is several notches above the usual writing in this genre. and (SPOILER ALERT FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW) i did much admire her trick with amy's journal. though i'd half guessed the truth about it--that it was a false write-up--i still felt it was ingeniously done. ditto, the first part of the book, in which nick might or might not be the killer--again, very clever writing and i'm impressed at how the author walked a fine line, letting readers interpret nick's words for themselves.<br />but, agreed with a sizable number of other reviewers. for me, the ending of the book leached away a lot of the meaning from what had gone before. it fell flat, it left me with an \\"is that all??\\" response--it didn't allow the book to rise above its genre and make any kind of overarching thoughtful point. with a different twist, i think i'd have found myself mulling over the novel for longer after i'd read it, trying to decide what the author wanted to say about men, women, marriage. as it was, i found the book a good, compelling vacation read that i pretty quickly forgot about a few days after having finished it. in fact, i'd still recommend it as a vacation read, but not as fiction that you can grapple with in any substantive way--which at one point i thought it might be.
B005KA188S|5.0|I didn't really see any of the promo's or the original movie before I bought this (and I won't lie I bought it because of the actors). HOWEVER, this is a good laugh.

Carly Rae is definitely going places. \\"This Kiss\\" is one of my favorites on this album; Carly Rae Jepsen does an excellent job on this and the music fits in perfectly with her vocals. \\"Call Me Maybe\\" is one of my favorite songs by Carly so far; this is one catchy tune that will get lots of airplay for quite some while to come. \\"Curiosity\\" again features Carly Rae as a fine singer who can do a pop tune alongside the best of them; and listen for other gems including a mighty fine \\"Good Time\\" with Owl City and Carly Rae together; \\"More Than a Memory\\" with that slightly poignant flavor that makes this pop tune memorable; \\"Turn Me Up\\" with that amazing sound; \\"Hurt So Good\\" with Carly Rae Jepsen never missing a beat; the charming \\"Beautiful\\" with Carly Rae and Justin Bieber; \\"Tonight I'm Getting Over You\\" that has Carly Rae singing out without ever letting go of a superfluous note; \\"Guitar String / Wedding Ring\\" with that stomping arrangement and the really great \\"Your Heart Is a Muscle.\\"<br /><br />For Carly Rae Jepsen's diehard fans, there are actually two deluxe versions of this CD. The one available here has three bonus tracks and a digital booklet available in .pdf format while the other, available at a brick and mortar store (Targ**), has the same three extra songs and replaces the digital booklet with a fourth pop song entitled \\"I Know You Have a Girlfriend.\\" The three bonus tracks available here are \\"Drive\\" with more excellent pop music while Carly Rae sings her heart out; the snazzy \\"Wrong Feels So Right\\" with Carly Rae at her usual very best and \\"Sweetie\\" which leaves me wanting more!<br /><br />Carly Rae Jepsen has released one awesome album with \\"Kiss\\" and its deluxe versions; she has a bright future ahead of her and she will be able to succeed at practically anything she wants to do.

0913866156|5.0|I got this deck today and I found it beautiful just like my first one I bought in Germany 1989. I cannot see any difference between decks printed in Switzerland and decks printed in Belgium. This is my favorite deck forever!
B00932A2MC|1.0|Somehow I knew it would be bad, but I didn't know the extent.  Great effects.  Spotty plot.  Ridiculous ending.<br /><br />On a technical note, the volume was very sporadic so I had to crank it up for some of the dialog but hurry to turn it down for music and other effects.<br /><br />Would have given it two stars if the sound issue didn't make it completely unwatchable.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It contains many twists and turns, that keeps you trying to figure out what is happening. it does keep you riveted
B007VUA7VO|4.0|really good detailed graphics ...really cool..I love how it tells you how much percent your battery has left before dying :)
B008HK3XOU|3.0|This is a really nice case. I like the fact the the Kindle goes to sleep when the cover is closed. It looks nice too. The one major fault is that there isn't any access for the power cord when the case is closed or in the standing position. You can change the position of your Kindle but it effects the sleep/wake feature when the cover is opened/closed.<br /><br />Overall it's a good case for a reasonable price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Finally for the kindle fire! I have been waiting forever to get this app and I got it the day it came out. I was tired of looking at all those Minecraft wannabes and was so happy when Mojang published the app!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The best calculator you could have.  Does everything,  easy to use,  easy to read,  and I love the large buttons and the running history makes it easy to check your numbers.  Thank you Kindle!
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Amazing, beautiful, inspiring, humbling. What an wonderful film that speaks to more than simply preparation of food but a philosophy on life that all should take on.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Friends With Benefits is an amazing movie. The movie is well written and creative. Hilarious and romantic. Definitely a must see.
B000I9S64U|5.0|An entire universe was addicted to a drug, ruled by machines, and liberated by religious crusades. A unique drug, the spice melange is the product of monstrous and gigantic worms that live in the sands of the dry planet Dune. Addicted to the drug, the people become apathetic and leave the machines to do their work, including the mental work. In time, they become slaves of men who control the machines until they liberate themselves during the religious crusades.  After thousand of years schools were created to reeducate them, two of which survived for each gender.<br /><br />The movie Dune is the product of the hard work of the producers working together with Frank Herbert, the author of the series of six books. It barely touches on the first book since the layers are many, complicated and esoteric at times. I have seen every version of the movies, including the TV version, and the newest versions which include some of the other books. I cannot have enough of this movie: it is my favorite movie ever; nothing comes close--in my opinion--to rival the quality of the acting, the plot, the production, the special effects and the (theme) music.<br /><br />To enjoy the movie better, I recommend reading at least the first book of the series titled Dune by Frank Herbert.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Ok, I'll try...<br /> errrrrm,*biting lip *laters baby *climax *eat<br /><br />There you have it, that's the book and I just saved you ten bucks.
B002Z7FWBI|4.0|Sat down on a Saturday and watched the entire collection. Reminded me of why I have always been a fan of Dirty Harry Callahan. Picture quality was decent and sound was straight out of the periods the movies were shot, although clear and crisp.

B0096DFBZQ|4.0|I really didn't think this game was that bad. It runs well on my kindle fire. I like the Mario kart feel of the game,  but the pacman features make it different,  so I like that. The controls will take awhile to get used to. It's just 2 arrows on the sides of the screen that determine your direction. Although I find the controls to be easier to manage than a touch screen keyboard :)<br />This is the demo version of the game,  but I might end up buying the full version.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so fun. it is like the real thing but you don't have to spend real money. gives you coins super fast.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great series!! It has all the scandal, romance, and drama without being trashy. I can't wait for season 3!!
B006TF6WAM|4.0|It initially took a while to get into the book, but once I got into it - was a nice read! A different story line.  Not my favourite book however.
1442419814|2.0|*Possible spoiler warning*<br /><br />My friend who had read this book before suggested it to me. After finishing it, I found that our views on it were clearly different.<br /><br />The good:<br />-Theme: The importance of appearance in our world is always something interesting to explore. The book also highlights the importance of individualality.<br />-The plot: A girl has to decide between becoming pretty like she's dreamed of her whole life or staying loyal to her friend and remaining 'ugly' forever.<br /><br />The bad:<br />-Tally: While this is partly due to the world she lives in, it's obvious one of the most important things to her is beauty. She's even willing to betray her trusting friend if it means she gets the operation. Tally knows Shay likes David, but only ignores this besides when thinking that Shay might get jealous. She comes off as whiny, unsympathetic, and rude. She's not the kind of character that you can feel for, relate to, or support. This might work for a supporting character, but definitely not the main character.<br />-Shay: While Shay started off as a great character who wanted to be herself, not a pretty, her personality and role quickly changed. Instead of being the girl whose best friend took her crush, she's the whiny jerk who won't accept that the person she likes is interested in someone else. By the end of the book, she's a pretty, which ruins what was her main character point. She was the only one to care that Tally had been a spy all along. Everyone else was surprised, but quickly got over it and accepted Tally.<br />-The romance: I didn't understand the romance between Tally and David. You get tiny hints that Tally's attracted to him, large hints from David, then BAM! She goes to meet his parents. I felt the romance was flat, as after they were \\"a couple\\" the only attraction they showed to each other was kissing. Then, at the end of the book, they're in love. It felt rushed and fake.<br /><br />Overall, the book isn't worth rereading in my opinion. It was streched out and rushed at the same time, had dull character interactions, and just fell flat. Midnighters was better. Enough said.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is a must read.  It makes you think about time and life.  Easy to read in a couple of days.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this book in one day. I could not put it down. Excellent excellent read and I would recommend to anyone.
B008J34466|5.0|I Love this Album. Pink is back and better than ever. Upon first listening to this album, I could tell that there are going to many hit songs here. My favorite tracks on the album are: \\"Blow Me(One last kiss), Try, Just give me a reason, True Love, and the title track, \\"The Truth about love.\\" Pink has stayed true to her roots and has made a fun Pop/Dance/Rock Commercial album. No experemental songs here, just more great songs from Pink. I know it's a good album because after only hearing it twice, I was walking around all day with the songs stuck in my head. Pinks voice is incredible and can't wait to see her in concert this time around.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously, so I'm at a loss to understand all the negative comments.  Jack Reacher isn't just about his physical prowess, he's also highly Intellegent, and I thought this was the emphasis in the first part of the story.  Jack in action was saved for later.  Also, there was quite a bit of dry Jack humor, some of it laugh-out-loud.  Come on, some of you are taking Jack too seriously.  However, I do agree, Tom Cruise is NO Jack Reacher !<br /><br />Lee Child, you are still holding true to the character of Jack.  Keep on writing him,  'cause I'm already waiting for the next one.
B0087HT36U|5.0|very fun addictive game lots of different levels exciting game play very good graphic design really enjoy playing this game
B008H5J510|4.0|Im not so much commenting on the film, but i am making public a possible issue with the overall first shipment of the product itself [[ASIN:B008H5J510 Katy Perry The Movie: Part of Me (Three-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)]].<br /><br />Apparently (only because i cannot find verifiable source reference yet) Some of the copies that went out from manufacturing did not include any bonus content on any dics as indicated on the packaging. According to the interwebs a/the second shipment of the product was correctly manufactured and was issued a yellow UPC code on the package. whether or not this is a verified validation of a complete product or not, i received my order as expected from amazon (Kudos there by the way, my first order) but the product i received is defective and missing the bonus content on the second disc as indicated by the packaging.<br /><br />A replacement has been ordered and i was advised if my replacement is the same that customer service will investigate further and possibly stop shipment on the product until verification can be made from the manufacturer that the product is complete
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The book is extremely fascinating for those who love this genre. I lost a lot of sleeping hours for this book and the other one in it's series. I can hardly wait for the last book in the trilogy.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|If you're on the fence about reading these take this as an invite from someone who is a serious reader to go ahead. I find this book worthy of the hype and large fan following.  The story moves fast, the post apocalyptic world of Panem is beleivable, most of the characters are well drawn, and the lessons about humanity in the face of tyranny and degredation profoundly connect with the narrative.  Collins also manages to speak deeply through these pages about our predatory reality TV/celebrity obsessed culture.  First class story-telling, thought provoking without moralizing, and a joy to read.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book is okay.  I understand that for security reasons details about the characters will be limited but I felt that it was too narrow where it did not pull me into the story as I hoped it would.  The events that are described in the book are very interesting and it offers a great insight as to how our government makes and deploys decisions when it comes to protecting our national security.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I'm enjoying this book as much or better than the first one. Following the characters in this book is much easier, and I haven't had any nightmares reading this one! (At least not yet!)
B0083SBM7Q|1.0|i for one loved the movie, however i am very disappointed in the dvd release. once again the dvd has no speial features at all and blu ray gets everything. why bother even putting it on dvd. just make this exclusive to blu ray since those who do not have blu ray get ripped off. why waste our time.
B004UID2LC|1.0|it was amazing at first. But my app kept crashing. Now it wont download anything, it wont even let me watch anything. AWFUL!!!
B0000041LO|5.0|Who knew 18-century chamber music could be so much fun? This set has real staying power; you can feel Haydn's playfulness and masterful structural virtuosity giving pleasure in the micro, and in the macro. The Beaux Arts Trio manage to keep things \\"classical\\" here, in spite of the difficulties of harnessing the resonance and volume of the modern grand piano and, save for the presence of low-frequency background noise evident in the lead-in silence, the recorded sound leaves little to be desired (unless you listen to their multi-channel 2-SACD Pentatone 9 Trios set). I haven't listened to many of their competitors, except for the Sony Vivarte Bylsma/Beths/Levin 27-30 period-performance disc (ASIN: B0000028UD). I have some preference for those performances, and not just for the HIP aspects; listen to some samples and hear for yourself. It's too bad they only recorded those four pieces.<br /><br />That said, this set is a bargain. For $45 or less, you get nine discs of world-class chamber music that charm from the outset, and benefit from repeated listening. To sum up in one word: \\"alive\\".
B007MAETA8|5.0|John really gets down to blues and folk roots in this album, all while staying true to his unique style.  Still, I have to say you can definitely tell he's matured a lot. This is one of those albums I could play over and over again without tiring of it!
B004UID2LC|2.0|Would have been 5 stars,  but the last update screwed things up. When I try to watch videos, it says error, and when I try to download something it wont let me. Before the update it was the best downloader I've used, so I hope they fix this problem soon.
B006XMVKD0|1.0|I am a new Amazon user.  I purchased a beloved classic to start my Kindle experience.  This edition is a fraud, unreadable.  Photocopied bits and pieces, a sham.  Let the buyer beware.
B0087HT36U|2.0|This is a fun Angry Birds clone that had you fling the rocks into the screen, making you can pick the exact spot you hit, rather than having to fling and pray you're accurate.<br /><br />However, there are several levels that are unbeatable because the timing on the levels is off. Watching walkthroughs, you can see that the game operates slower on the S3. I think it's just a programming issue, and I hope they fix it soon.
B008OOYALE|1.0|this is a great game however many features are not supported on kindle fire for instance the new update today...new layout...new dragons etc.  Also you need a guide map to advance quickly and like the update this guide book is not available to kindle users so you have to \\" figure out\\" what to do without directions.  I've emailed TL and really got nothing except sorry we're working on it but can't tell you when it will be available.  Good game for free but app is not compatible with kindle. Side note the game force closes & freezes easily every 5 minutes despite uninstalling & reinstalling. Not good for kindles.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|I don't know what other title might be used for this one.  It's not a sports show.  It's not a cooking show.  It is a love of fishing.  And a growing love affair that somehow doesn't give up.  And yes, Yemen is still Yemen. But I took a chance on this one and wasn't disappointed.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I like the functionality of this product. I can edit and create documents, which comes in handy for class. It would be nice if there was a sync feature.
B0000024YL|4.0|The mujsic was what I expected-great.  The sound quality of this disc was not good.  I constantly up and lower the volume when listening, which is quite inconvenient.
B007JUWM64|3.0|I felt the story plot was good, the action far to slow and the<br />musketeers  did not do enough acting...............
B00004VVN9|5.0|I remember this one from way back in the day. I love Christopher Walken and Natalie Wood, and this movie still entertains me all these years later.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this app. Fun for almost all ages. My favorite so far is the racing on page two. Thanks for a app full of fun mini games
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I was worried that this game would be more stressful than fun. I was wrong. It sometimes takes several tries before I solve a puzzle but that just makes it more enjoyable. A nice little game to relax with and use a few brain cells.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was the first military book I have read, but after seeing the interview on 60 minutes, I just had to get it.  I have always thought highly of all our military personnel, but after reading this book, I'm even more proud of all those that fight for our country.<br /><br />This book is anything but the \\"Hype and Glorification\\" of the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden.  I honestly felt this book did NOT divulge any confidential information or secrets.  But this man's story really needed to be told and I for one am very glad he did!
1423101499|4.0|Riordan's imagination soars as high as Icarus with this installment of the Percy Jackson Series - The Battle of the Labyrinth. Percy's a freshman in high school now, but his summer at Camp Half-Blood promises to keep him on his toes. There's new friends, new foes, a new quest, and as the danger grows closer, Percy discovers trust can be complicated.<br /><br />The story opens with Percy attending high school orientation at his new school. Immediately, he meets up with his mortal friend, Rachel Elizabeth Dare and is attacked by demon cheerleaders, the empousa. Percy wins the day and finds his way to Camp Half Blood where he learns about Daedalus' Labyrinth. It still exists and there's a secret entrance to Camp Half Blood. If Luke finds it, then Kronos and his minions are sure to attack. Percy's friend, Annabeth, gets to lead a quest into the Labyrinth, but everyone on the journey has an agenda. Will Grover find Pan? Can Percy and Annabeth find Daedalus? Will Nico, the son of Hades, prove himself friend or foe? Has Kronos gained enough strength to take human form? Percy and his friends can only hope for the best.<br /><br />Riordan opens the novel with Percy and Rachel battling the demon cheerleaders. The action grabs the reader and the mystery of the Labyrinth keeps them turning the page. The plot moves at a good clip. Riodan's writing is sharp, witty, and easy to read.<br /><br />As with Riordan's other books in the series, he continues to bring the ancient Greek heroes and their stories to life in a way modern readers can related to. Riordan's creativity shines.<br /><br />The characters are very likable. Percy is easy to relate to. He's a great friend, heroic, and always does the right thing despite his challenges. Annabeth, Grover, and Rachel each have very human elements that allow them to connect with readers.<br /><br />The Battle of the Labyrinth is fast paced and breathtaking. Readers 9 years-old and up will enjoy this book. It can be read as a stand alone, but it fits into the series nicely. I highly recommend this story to all who enjoy young adult and middle school novels.but it fits into the series nicely. I highly recommend this story to all who enjoy young adult and middle school novels.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i have no issues with with app. its fast and easy and I love it! its super convinient! I definatley reccomend this for everybody!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Chilling, dark, and powerful. It has the emotional inensity of Lord of the Flies or Brave New World. The characters are elegantly portrayed and purposeful. The Hunger Games is believeable, vastly creative, and original. You will dream about it. You will live and breathe in the world of Panem. And, most frighteningly, you will discover that the residents of that dystopia are simply a reflection of ourselves.

B000XHBHKW|4.0|This British studio progressive rock band led by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson had six albums make the U.S. Billboard Top 200 album charts from 1977 to 1984 for Arista, and this was the fourth, released in November 1980. It's a concept album in that the tracks more or less tell the continuing story of a man facing mid-life crisis who decides to risk everything he has at a casino. Like many who really do pursue this pipe-dream, he loses everything. The album reached # 13 on Billboard's album charts, eventually reaching platinum status.<br /><br />Hit singles to emerge were Games People Play (not the same song as the Joe South 1969 hit) which peaked at # 16 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in December 1980/January 1981 on Arista 0573 b/w the album track instrumental The Ace Of Swords, Time which climbed to # 10 Adult Contemporary (AC) and # 15 Hot 100 in June/July 1981 on Arista 0598 b/w the instrumental The Gold Bug, also from the album, and Snake Eyes, which struggled to a # 67 Hot 100 in October 1981 on Arista 0635 b/w I Don't Wanna Go Home, another album cut.<br /><br />The tracks, all written by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson, are:<br />Side 1<br />1. May Be A Price To Pay (lead vocal by \\"Elmer Gantry\\" - really Dave Terry) - 4:52<br />2. Games People Play (lead vocal by Lenny Zakatek) - 4:17<br />3. Time (lead vocal by Eric Woolfson with Alan Parsons backing) - 5:05<br />4. I Don't Wanna Go Home (lead vocal by Lenny Zakatek) - 4:54<br />Side 2<br />1. The Gold Bug - 4:28<br />2. The Turn of a Friendly Card - 16:19<br />  i. The Turn of a Friendly Card (Part One) (lead vocal by Chris Rainbow) - 2:39<br />  ii. Snake Eyes (lead vocal by Chris Rainbow) - 3:17<br />  iii. The Ace of Swords - 2:58<br />  iv. Nothing Left To Lose (lead vocal by Eric Woolfson) - 4:03<br />  v. The Turn Of A Friendly Card (Part Two) (lead vocal by Chris Rainbow) - 3:12<br /><br />The back cover provides the lyrics and track-by-track sessionography.
B005LAII6M|5.0|ALICE SHOT AND KNIFED ME BETWEEN THE EYES AND I LIVED TO TELL ABOUT IT!!!!! (Not to mention the large axe and giant licker removing my head, etc!) These effects were even better than RE#4. The best effect was when Alice slung the blade at me! I just about **** myself with that one! VERY REAL! It was right there!<br /><br />Just a note, you do need 3D glasses to see it in 3D. The standard glasses do not fit over prescription glasses. A clip on (to prescription glasses) version of the 3D glasses exists. There is the non 3D version of the movie as well.<br /><br />The movie opens where RE#4 left off - on top of the Arcadia (freighter) with all the humans released and enjoying their freedom. I was hoping to have K-MART and especially Claire back. We aren't shown it, but are left to assume the worst for them when Umbrella attacks. This in itself added an element of sadness to start it all. The opening scene in reverse was different, sort of a \\"wish we could go back and try again\\" in their remembrance. The movie does not pretend they never existed, we do see a few stills of K-MART, Claire & Chris Redfield from RE#4.<br /><br />The action doesn't slow for very long (just long enough for Alice to get kidnapped, get into a skin tight dominatrix/cat suit, and escape).<br /><br />I was beginning to think Alice was caught in a RE video game of sorts when the Tokyo sequence fired up around her (same one from the opening of RE#4, same people, same outcome).<br /><br />Did you like the 12 foot axeman in RE #4? Try 2! Alice and Ada Wong team up to take them down!<br />This is the New York sequence. Be prepared to get a haircut, a shave, and a beheading!<br /><br />Part of the zombie mutation this time around seems to be INTELLIGENCE! There was a large bunch of Russian zombies operating vehicles and weapons with no problem (Moscow sequence)!<br /><br />There was a bit of a love story in this. Alice falls in love with a little girl who mistakes her for her mommy (Suburbia sequence)!Alice's strong bond with the little girl is evident when she chases down and rescues the girl from a giant licker (despite everything about to get blown to kingdom come).<br /><br />The zombies under ice was about as creepy as you can get. Alice sees them swimming under ice while battling evil Rain (RE#1). Rain falls under ice when Alice blows a hole in it; the zombies swarm up like piranha! One last attempt to break free as she says, \\"I'm coming for you!\\" Alice says, \\"Good luck with that!\\" as the zombies pull Rain under for good!<br /><br />Something else different - one of the good guys turned bad.. turns good again! Remember Jill Valentine (RE#2 and very end of RE#4)?<br /><br />The movie ends with a massive battle scene in progress (humankind versus zombies/dragons/red queen/etc.), and we know where it has to go now - but leaves room for RE#6. Alice and Albert Wesker versus the Red Queen? I wouldn't have seen that coming!<br /><br />There is no surprise ending this time like RE#4 where the movie picks back up after about a minute of ending credits. There is no final blurb from Alice at the very, very end, such as \\"Is that any way to treat a lady (RE#4)?!\\" or \\"You're just another a****** (RE#3)!\\"<br /><br />This movie opened at #1 this past weekend, and if it does well overall, rumor has it there will be RE#6! As a huge RE fan, this would be fine with me! Fingers crossed!<br /><br />I have seen the movie twice in 3D, and liked it even more the second time! There is so much action going on continuously that it's hard to get it all the first time! Probably I'd see more the 3rd time. Constant surprises! (Nice, NRA protesting) Rain and Suburbia Alice have a conversation while speeding away from the zombies only to be suddenly interupted by a...well... go see it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />Final note: I am writing this at the time the movie is still in the theater and not yet out on dvd. So when the dvd does get released, I do not expect Amazon to separate the 3Dfrom the non-3D reviews like last time (RE#4).
B008KEQMDC|1.0|I spent the first hour of this movie trying to figure out what the plot was. Then quickly realized there was no plot and that writers of this movie thought of a subject, \\"pregnancy\\" and put together a mish mosh of pointless, poor humored clips and decided hire some poor actors and call it a movie.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I downloaded Adobe Reader so that I could read pdf files on my Kindle Fire also. Now I don't have to wait until I can sit at my desk computer.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I LOVE pinterest.  And this app works mostly fine accept you have to open each picture in order to like, comment, or even repin it.
B0088TG252|3.0|Good  concept but plot too confusing to follow in places.  Dialogue was also very difficult to hear which added to the confusion.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I really enjoyed this album. I don't like how they are being used by Apple. Hopefully they have made enough money to keep releasing albums.
B009329Y30|4.0|Zac Efron has really grown up. This is a nice romance with the addition of a cute kid and fun dogs.
B003RNZFRK|5.0|Excellent album. Very fun! The album starts off strong and never lets up. This was my first experience with the band.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I just like it. It works greatly on the ipod touch, no conflict with The Play or itunes. No complaint here
B001AGXEA6|5.0|This is a review for Beetlejuice Blu-Ray.  The video transfer from Warner Bros. is pretty good given the films 25 yr pedigree.  On my disc you must manually select the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless auidio track; it defaults to the Lossy DD 5.1.<br /><br />The Orig. 1.85:1 is slightly stretched to properly fill a 16:9 screen.  Danny Elfman's musical score is showing its age as it is not as crisp as a typical new movie.  Although it is noticebly better than the DVD audio track.<br /><br />It was a must have to fill my ever growing Blu-ray collection!
0446677450|4.0|But I am a lot richer having taken the advice of the book.  I hope my kids have learned this lesson.
B003R0LBVW|2.0|I had a hard time reading this.  Characters were whiny and didn't evolve or change.  I thought this book was an attempt of the author cramming his political views down my throat.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|This seemed like an awesome book so I got it. As i was reading it got better and better. But from the advertisement I saw for the movie the book is way diffrrent. I almost got half way through and the book screwed up. Amazon sent me an email saying a new one would be posted on their website. Well it has been 13 days and<br /> no update! I am waitin' Amazon!
B004KPLVV8|4.0|TRON: The Original Classic.<br /><br /> TRON is one of those films that is impossible to review on its own merits.  It is so connected with external events that it is these relationships that are more important.<br /><br /> It has been repeatedly mentioned that this is a great movie.  The plot is sometimes obscured by the visually stunning graphics, but that is OK.  Cindy Morgan is drop dead gorgeous.  Furthermore this film, as good as it was originally, has improved with age, for it evokes the ethos of the beginning of the age of video games.  All of these things were amply brought up by other reviewers.<br /><br /> But there is another aspect of these external relationships that was alluded to, but worth going in into further.  That is the relationship between Disney and this film.  This was not an in-house production.  The fact that it was made by Disney outsiders is probably the reason that such a good film could even come from this corporation.<br /><br /> Disney has shown only contempt for the American people.  This is evidenced by the endless stream of sleekly produced, yet insipid films that insult the intelligence of the viewers.  Then there is a long history of using the company's money to lobby congress to pass laws which gutted two centuries of tradition concerning fair use and public domain.  As far as this film is concerned, in the period before the release of TRON: LEGACY, Disney took the unusual and somewhat draconian step of removing the original TRON from circulation.<br /><br /> Disney's contempt for their audience is clearly shown in the mastering of this disk.  This is particularly noticeable in the nonintuitive way that one must use to skip the trailers.  These trailers for Disney-mind-pablum are unusually intrusive and difficult to circumvent.<br /><br /> In spite of this, it is a good DVD and is certainly worth buying.
B00932A2MC|3.0|This film has great action sequences and effects. Decent story line with good and good looking actors/actresses. Pretty good movie.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This was a really fast read. I loved the characters and how their lives ended u working together. Mich Albom always turns out excellent stories that make your heart sing. The story makes you realize the importance of time in your own life and how you use it.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The wife loved it. I felt it started slow but the story is well written and picked up nicely. Having not read the book, it was enjoyable but guys don't expect huge action through it.
B000XXTCF8|4.0|Good album. A must have for a Van Morrison fan. This has all the original recordings of classic hits. Good stuff!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I do not like writing reviews but this person had a lot of courage to do this book. Being former military i know the rules about disclosing info. But, the government is about to put out their own take on what happened . I'm glad to have this person's version first.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Did not like the book at all.  Had to finish because I started it.  Just did not like the story at all.
B007SGM084|5.0|This Book trilogy is insane. I actually bought the first book 50 shades of Grey in paperback. I got a few chapters in before I decided I was going to need to read them all! I love that they came as a trilogy for the kindle because then people don't ask questions....they don't know what your reading which makes it twice as exciting when you read it in a public place. Honestly, though you can't top this book. Every female should read it. Probably every man should too!! I give it an absolute 5 start but I will tell you....you need to have an open mind to want to like this book...it may push the limit for some women.
B008XCF7Y6|3.0|hard to keep viewing the show for all the reloading stream matter. I thought I was buying a hard copy dvd not making a view library.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|This movie isn't your corny lesbian move. You actually feel for the characters. You feel passion when they feel it, you feel anxious when they feel it, and you feel awkward when they feel it. I absolutely loved the movie!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I even buy it and it will not let me down load it so it took the money away from me
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book is a must have for fantasy lovers.  Sanderson has created a new world and it sucks you in from the first page.  You will not be able to put it down.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got this for my babies. they will love it!! good graphics keeps you interested the prizes are easy to get.
B002LAM7PI|4.0|I am so happy I got to see Coraline finally. The quality of the story telling and the imagination used to realize this world in such a unique way should really be praised. I can't really criticize the movie for being dark or intense because it never claims to not be. It should be noted that younger kids (under 10yrs) may find some of the scenes really scary because the main villain imprisons Coraline's parents at one point. I think of this film as having the same vibe as early Jim Henson fantasy movies such as the Dark Crystal or Labyrinth.<br /><br />I really loved this movie and now wished I had purchased it rather than simply rented it from Amazon's fantastic instant streaming service.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I used to like this app but recently something has happened, it has completely stopped working all together!!!!! idk what they did but I can no longer view videos or download music .  what has happeened? i know that it not just me because ppl have the same app are having the same problem. please fix this app!!!!!_
B002OSXDAU|5.0|This is the first book I've read written by Ayn Rand and I plan to read Atlas Shrugged next.  The reason I bought the book was to find out what all the fuss was about relating to Paul Ryan (perhaps our next VP) and his being influenced by her philosophy.<br /><br />Rand was a wonderful writer.  I could 'see' the characters and she created scenic visuals on the page.  I will reread this book several times over the next few years.  There are so many layers, I feel I'll enjoy it even more each time I read it.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with Rand's ideology, she weaves it throughout the book as an undercurrent--so rather than diminish the story--it enhances it.  I highly recommend this book--again, and again, and again : )
6305882592|1.0|I was very disappointed when I tried to watch this video.It seems that in Australia we need a different format than that of USA or Canada.I now have a useless DVD which will cost me more to return than it is worth. Please send me your comments to ednallewellyn@hotmail.com
B000I5X824|5.0|Arrived sooner than expected and fast. Has all the perfect songs. Comfortably Numb is one of my favorites and Aaron Lewis did such a good job!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|a really great book and an easy read.  you will learn a lot about the seals without giving away national secrets.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Afrer reading this crazy book in an amazingly short time, I was angry when I got to the last page.  I couldn't believe the author chose that ending!  This book is truly about more than one psychotic person, but I had to continue reading to find  out what happened next.  The characters are well developed, and the story line keeps you guessing.  I have to give it 4 stars because of the ending.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|This album and this group has plenty of reviews, accolades, awards and fans to not really need a 5 star rating from me or anyone else. If you're a fan of music, whether it be classical, rock, metal or punk, Pink Floyd has at least once crossed into your realm of listening. Their album, 'Dark Side of the Moon',  spent years on the charts and has spawned many stories about playing it along side the movie 'Wizard of Oz'. This album, 'The Wall', is a continuation of this band's magnificent writing style put forth in an operatic forum that rolls effortlessly from one track to the next. My little review here will not change the fact that this album should be placed in any one's top 100 count of all time 'must have' or great rock albums alongside other classics from Led Zeppelin, Blind Faith, Cream, The Rolling Stones and the Beatles. I own the live performance version of this album also and enjoy listening to both on a regular basis. Alongside other classic albums of theirs, such as 'Animals' and 'Wish You Were Here', and the aforementioned 'Dark Side', and lesser known but still great listening albums such as 'Ummagumma' and 'Meddle', this band always delivers superb melodies and haunting lyrics that make them one of the greatest bands ever in rock history. Buy their music, listen to it and enjoy the ride.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|It kept my engaged through out the whole book.  It even more made me want to check out the history of the events in the book.  The characterw were well fleshed out and engaging.  The flow of events riveting.  did not want put the book down.  Liked it so much I got the sequel, and am reading it now.  would and have highly recomended it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent read! All Americans should read & have better understanding of the sacrifices (& dedication) our Seals deal with daily; being prepared to respond on a moment's notice!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is a good game .it is kind of addicting.I started playing and could not put it down. I give it 4stars.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book thinking it was going to be good.  I was sadly disappointed with the writing style and the story itself.  I cannot understand why people are raving about it.  I will not be reading the second or third book.  I could care less what happens ...
B000QRIGLC|2.0|The first half of this book is so full of needless details and it is almost impossible to read.  Definitely written by a guy who thinks he is really cool but tries to say enough nice stuff about others to knock you off the trail.  If you insist on trying to read this one, skip the first half.  If you do read the first half that will be part of your life that you will never get back.
B0055TJI86|3.0|Of the many British bands to have records released in the U.S. during the 1970s/1980s, this progressive-rock aggregation certainly was among those with the least amount of commercial success in terms of charted singles. From 1971 to 1977 they had but 7, and only two of those managed to get into the Top 40 - Living In The Past, a # 11 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in late 1972/early 1973, and the late 1974 Bungle In The Jungle, a # 12. The others never even made the Top 50.<br /><br />One reason may have been their seemingly unabated infatuation with blatant sexuality. But then, how does one account for their 14 gold albums sold over here, all on the British Chrysalis label, which certainly did not present any change in their approach to music? Perhaps, overall, it was simply a case of their songs not being conducive to air- and juke-box play in North America which always tended to be well behind the British in achieving a more liberal approach to lyrics, not to mention dialogue in their TV shows! As of this writing, the sitcom Mother Brown's Boys is STILL a bit more avant-garde to air on any main networks.<br /><br />In any event, this was their 14th and last North American charted album (Chrysalis CHS 41590), coming out in September 1987, and making it to # 32 on Billboard's Top 200 album charts, going gold in the process. The tracks feature much more of the electric guitar work of Martin Barre and synthesizer contributions of Ian Anderson, and despite the fact it would be their lowest-charting album here, it did go on to win a controversial 1988 Grammy for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal Or Instrumental amidst the loud screams of critics that Jethro Tull was NEITHER hard-rock or heavy metal.<br /><br />Those involved in the album's production resembled a small army as evidenced by the list of names which takes up one whole side of the inner sleeve, while the reverse contains the track lyrics. The attractive crest on the cover is by Andrew Stewart Jamieson, renowned scribe and heraldic artist who has done work, including written illuminated manuscripts, for royalty, government personalities, celebrities and private individuals the world over.<br /><br />Band members are: vocalist/acoustic & electric guitarist Ian Anderson (also flute, percussion, keyboard, and automatic drum programming where used); electric and acoustic guitarist Martin Barre; bass guitarist Dave Pegg (also acoustic bass); drummers Doane Perry and Gerry Conway.<br /><br />The tracks, all written by Ian Anderson, are:<br />Side One<br />1. Steel Monkey - 3:35<br />2. Farm On The Freeway - 6:28<br />3. Jump Start - 3:51<br />4. Said She Was A Dancer - 3:39<br />Side Two<br />1. Budapest - 10:00<br />2. Mountain Men - 6:20<br />3.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|A pretty good story line and relatively well written.  This book offers just enough background without driving you nuts with details that don't matter.  It was nice to read about a seal who didn't spend the whole book telling you how cool they are yet saying they were't supposed to say that!  It was an fun read that was hard to put down.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Worse than 1st book lacking detail still talks to her self to much and murmurs to frequently If you actually are a reader I don't recommend this book
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The app consistently &quot;expands&quot; with your uses of it.<br /> This knowledge-ecosystem can glorify God (Jesus) with greater and greater efficacy the more you interact with it unto such an end (and means).
098478280X|4.0|I read both books while I was testing out the job market. They definitely were a great guide for me. I applied to all four major tech companies that are talked about in the books: Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon.<br /><br />I got call backs from Microsoft and Amazon. I passed the phone interviews with both, but turned down Amazon's request for a second technical phone interview, and just focused on Microsoft. Amazon's first phone interview was the hardest I've hard in the three months I tested the job market. One of the questions they asked me was verbatim in Cracking the Coding Interview book. Despite that, my brain was literally fried afterwards, they had me write code on paper and recite it back to them over the phone. I didn't feel like  punishing myself through a second interview, because I finally came to terms that I didn't really want to work in Seattle, WA or like the job position for that matter.<br /><br />I ended up getting flown to Chicago and Mountain View, CA for two jobs with Microsoft. The book was a huge help in helping me get over the phone interview. Reading the tips in the book made me take the process more methodically. Despite that, I did not end up getting both jobs. One job was already filled by an inside candidate, they were just putting me through a phony interview to meet their interview quota before giving it away. The other I flat out bombed the white board part.<br /><br />The things mentioned in The Google Resume about Microsoft seemed to be outdated though. My interviews were nothing like the book suggested they would be. Seems like they changed their format, and they interview you the whole day even if they don't plan on taking you.<br /><br />With that being said, this book was an invaluable guide along my job search. Definitely recommend it for anybody that wants to work in the tech industry, even if it's not for a top-tier tech firm.<br /><br />Oh, and I'm still waiting on Apple and Google.
0938045695|2.0|I've owned the book, and read, reviewed and studied it more times than I can count.  I've obsessively been using kettlebells for over 3 years and when I read the book, I had been using them for a year.<br /><br />If you have never swung a kettlebell before, and after buying the book,  I would suggest 2 things.  1. Go see an instructor for a couple of sessions.  2. Youtube University<br /><br />The Turkish Getup is a complex movement to learn because there are so many steps.  A book cannot do it justice.<br />The Swing is not a squat movement, you need to drop your hips back.  Pavel has some great drills in here on how to do so and the explanations are excellent<br />Most people including myself and everyone I've seen, don't clean correctly at the beginning, they bang their wrists.<br />He doesn't go in enough detail on the snatch.  The snatch will tear up your hands if not done correctly.  The worst part of the snatch on the hands is the drop.  He doesn't explain enough how to release the bell.<br /><br />The Program Minimum is a good way to break into kettlebells, but Pavel doesn't explain what to do once you can do 5 minutes of getups.  Do you up the minutes or up the weight?  Also he doesn't tell you how you should progress on your swings.  One hand or two?<br /><br />The Rite of Passage Clean and Press program with pullups is the meat and potatoes of this book.  It's fantastic and works.  The swing program to snatch a kettlebell? Eh.  You're not getting to 200 snatches in 10 minutes with this program.  People might have done it, but they supplemented.  Also, when you are struggling moving up to the next bell.  Pavel, instead of giving tips, wants you to download special reports.<br /><br />Also he should have added some squatting into the workout.  He really missed the boat in regard to this.<br /><br />All in all, it is informative and instructive.  The ladders approach is excellent and challenging.  The book however is incomplete.  Don't believe me?  Go to thedragondoor forum and see how often the same ETK question come up.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good read. All the hoopla about revealing tactics and classified information is a crock. Nothing more here than you would find in Blackhawk Down or Bing West books. One man's account of his experiences and a total over reaction by the media and DOD.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|So it's about Jack and you've gotta love him and I will always read the next Jack Reacher story but, and you knew there was going to be one, it isn't as fabulous as the earlier adventures.  I guess I didn't relate to the characters as much as I would usually.  It felt contrived and deliberately convoluted to showcase the red herrings in the narrative.  Not my favourite and as an aside will be very disappointed if the rumours are true - that Tom will be playing Jack - not cool.  Hello - the height factor?!?
B0053TMP24|5.0|The saga continues with Percy and his new friends. The characters are great and the story moves very quickly! Can't wait for the next one!
B008BRC7BE|5.0|This collaboration between the guitarist of Black Sabbath and the singer of Deep Purple really brings out the best of both artists. The album is stunning and is a must have for fans of both bands. \\"Black Sabbath meets Deep Purple\\" - this is the only apt description of this fantastic album.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book was easy to read and follow.  It gave details of how tough the day to day optyations are. Some stories about levity in the ranks. But threes no doubt that theses guys are elete killers. There were no tell all secrets being exposed. I don't see why all this talk about the author doing any harm. The best is seeing a picture of the gun used to plug osoma bin loden. Thanks Mark for getting the rat.
B008XG1X18|4.0|the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it freezes up &amp; kicks me off sometimes. not enough to discourage me from using the app.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I read the first two books and enjoyed the plot.  In the other two books the author does  get sidetracked and  strays from the plot.  In the third book it gets worse.  He also gets too preachy and political.  I finally jumped to the last few pages  just to see if Sanders ends up okay.  I never cared for the main male character.  He is a  know it all jerk.  But as  I said I liked plot but not the straying.
B008602KQI|5.0|Real all the books and the movie was the best.  I feel the director and actors where all great in the presentation of the first book.  I am glad they didn't do all of them in one.  So I have more to look forward to.  If I was younger I would try one of them cross bows now.
B008M34INW|4.0|MG knocks it out of the ball park with this movie. Get the Gringo is a funny, sad, action film that will not let  you go until the end.  I highly recommend this movie.  The reason that I did not give it a 5 star review, is the ending.  As usual the good guy/hero/antihero wins the day!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|A very well written book. Wonderful and exciting story line. I am looking forward to reading all the fifty shades books.
B0091XRL86|3.0|Not the best from Ardman Studios, still worth a gander. Story was ok. The Characters were original and entertaining! I would recommend this to anyone interested in animation and of course as a family movie.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I was looking for a new series that was going to be made into a movie and happened upon this one.  While I did like the book, I wasn't as enthralled as I was with the Twilight or the Harry Potter series (just my personal preference).  I would, however, recommend it to others and I am planning on purchasing the next book in the series.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Awesome Show. Great Story and Chatacter lines.  It is a very addictive show, but worth every minute and penny and dollar!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This app is really fun. I'm addicted to it, I have to play it every day! Can't wait to see more puzzles added.

B005K01VZS|5.0|What a belief that people can still come together,work together even with different faith's, but still work for the come good of all.<br />It's a book to read again when we start to wonder if faith is letting us down.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All three of these books are fenominal. They will keep your blood pumping and heart racing. I recommend them to ANYONE that loves action and adventure. Good reads.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Good book, kind of novice type of writing but a clear look into the problems of writing an account like this and wanting the truth to be told on how some of these missions are conducted.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Another enjoyable detective adventure by Michael Connelly.  True to his style.  I could not put this book down until it was done!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not ever story is going to be a cookie cutter, drama of perfect love. I've seen some bad reviews, but I liked the book. Couldn't wait to read more!
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|Great action. Love the helicopter scenes. brings back great memories with a kick! its a great movie for everyone. Watched it with my wife and was very pleased.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Despicable Me is a great way to spend 2 hours just laughing and feeling good for about two hours. A great story, wonderful voices and some great family moments. We enjoy it and have it on our Instant Video so we can watch it any time and we don't have to look to for the DVD when we want to watch it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I really enjoyed reading \\"Mark's\\" book.  The book gives a very good overall \\"feel\\" for what a day in the life of an operator is like.  Really covers some good ground with regard to the OBL raid.  No sure we'll ever know where the real truth lies, but I don't suspect Mark has any real ulterior motives or hidden agenda WRT the raid events.  Certainly sheds some interesting light on the raid.  Most interestingly though, his book allows us to see the operation through his eyes - giving a unique and very entertaining perspective on a tremendous military accomplishment.  I walked away from this very quick and easy read with a new perspective and a healthy does of respect for Mark and his peers, who probably aren't speaking to him now.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's a slow read for me in an odd form. More prose like at times. It definitely reads like a first time novelist wrote it.
B005FJ7EIC|4.0|This is an overall good vampire movie with a new spin. I've seen many vampire genre types and this one was a fresh new story approach. Very entertaining.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It is not a bad book...but I wish I would have borrowed it form the library instead of spending money on it...you at certain points want to hit Ana over the head...because she must be very young and stupid to not have red flags going up over this idiot...and he is the one who should be getting a beating...seriously don't buy it borrow it from someone or get it from the library and it is NOT an adult version of twilight.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A wonderful App!! Diversity of Bibles, comments, comparisions, devotionals, reading plans... Every active Bible reader should have it... Really love it!!
B00122LXTM|5.0|Good commercial overview of an illustrious career. All the hits are included, so kick back, light a doob, and mellow out!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app. Have had 0 issues on my Fire; loads all of my favorite locations, never crashes, &amp; is always up-to-date &amp; spot-on. I've also never seen porn-like ad's with this app. I absolutely recommend this app for anyone who wants accurate, timely, up-to-date weather forecasts. I also love the 15 day forecast; spot-on &amp; super simple to use!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|LOVE IT WELL DONE, TRIP BACK IN TIME; THE PERIOD AND ATTITUDES OF THE DAY WERE CAPTURED BEAUTIFULLY!  A DEFINITE MUST SEE!
B008D28HYS|5.0|Love it. Not for everyone, but this has kept my interest longer than any other game in the app store. Best part was I got it as the free app of the day.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Read the book due to allergies. Good information on nutrition and some of Problems that wheat can cause. I am off wheat products and have lost a few pounds and feel better.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was looking for a good book to take on vacation this year, so I downloaded book one, it was so good, I couldn't put it down, and finished it in 2 days.  By the time I got to book 3 I was sad that I was almost done with the trilogy. Can't wait for #4! E.L James, please don't dissapoint!!!
B005DJREJS|5.0|I'm a forty year old hygienist who was recommended this show buy a16 year old patient who said it was the best..... I agree
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Well writen narrative. The characters stayed within their caracteristics and normals for them. It gets a little wordy at times as all these books have done, as if some of the passagess are there just to add length to the novel rather than adding somethine to the book. Overall a good entertaining read.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|I think the film is weak by Tim Burton / Johnny Depp standards. I think it had trouble knowing what it wanted to be, more camp comedy, more action and tension with Angelic. Certainly no Sleepy Hollow.<br /><br />There were some priceless moments, and some great scenes. The scene where Barnabas and Angelic get it on is great. but I think the script could have been better. It was uneven in places, slow in places, and failed to develop things when it had the opportunity.<br /><br />The video around the Karen Carpenter song was great, funny, and accomplished a lot in the story. However, the appearance by Alice Cooper could have been used more, and seemed like a lost opportunity.<br /><br />The trailers give the impression that this is a camp comedy, which it isn't. So if that is the movie you are expecting this isn't Adam's Family.  There are some funny bits, but they seem to be thrown in somewhat randomly.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The author did a good job writing the Hunger Games Trilogy.  She started off talking about how the heroine supported her family by hunting, she revisited the hunting grounds in the second book and in the third, she came back so it was firmly implanted in the minds of the readers.  Also, she remained constant to the young man that befriended her when she was a child and he loved her throughout the games and put her first.  The suspense of what was going to happen next was riveting. It held my interest throughout all of the books and although it was written for young adults, I did not miss the intimate romance that most writers feel they need to write to sell their books.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|If you liked her other books, you will probably like this one as well... To me they are like popcorn - easy and fast to eat, but not much substance. I love all the technical stuff... at least when she sticks to forensics, I feel like I do learn a little something through the reading.<br /><br />BTW, if you are thinking of picking this up because you like Bones, think again - The back story is completely different and you will probably be disappointed.<br /><br />************SPOILERS BELOW*******************<br /><br />One thing I wish Kathy would do in future books would be to NOT have Tempe kidnapped and smacked on the head with a gun, or other heavy object. I would think she would have brain damage by now. Sometimes I feel like I am reading a Hardy Boys novel!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love it! Wish we could see it easily in the states now and not January dang it!! I would recommend it to anyone.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|This was a great game when it came out but after having all the new Angry Birds it's a little dated.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well done. Easy read. To the point. We owe a debt of gratitude to men and women of armed forces of the U. S.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I surprised myself.  I liked this book very much.  I also found that I couldn't wait for the next book.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|This book is a gem!  It is a story within a story about life on one of the Channel Islands under German occupation during WW2.  It starts slowly and the decision to write it via letters is a little off putting at start, but persevere because it will delight with its characters and the one who becomes the heroine, a most unlikely candidate considering the circumstances. The author is clever, weaving one story around another and introducing characters like red herrings who may, or may not, become important.  The author, a writer within, moves between locales in both time and place, creating a fascinating introduction to several worlds. The title is quirky and yet in context it works wonderfully well with the slightly pythonesque humour throughout the book.  A tremendous and very enjoyable read.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|Didn't much care if Harold made it to his destination.  Didn't much care that his feet hurt or his shoes wore out. Come to think about it, I didn't much care for any of it.  I did finish the book and when all was said and done I found it tedious at best and boring at its worst.  Not my cup of tea.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Within the first three episodes of this show there are references to Bill Murray, John Hughes and they play an Aimee Mann song, I was sold on this show right then and there. This is one of the strongest first seasons of a show I've seen in a long time. This show is a classic like Family Guy or It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, the kind of show where you can watch the same episodes over and over again and see things you didn't notice before and laugh like you did the first time you watched it. This show is cast so well, this is one of those shows that just works. I'm really glad it's not shot on a crappy half set with a laugh track, I hate that s#@%. They need to put this out on Blu-Ray already, so for now this is as good as it gets. I bought this for my sister and my Dad, and I'll probably buy it again for someone else. I think everyone should watch this show at least once.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I truly love the story.  The book is wonderful to read.  I love the characters and I feel that I am there, watching the story unfold, as I read this book.  I keep wondering how it will all end...I have one more book to read.  Congratulations to the author!  She has created a sensation with this one.  Can't wait until it is on the big screen.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|This is one of those cult classic movies I grew up with as a kid that seemed like no one else my age knew about. Yet as I have gotten older, it seems like everyone and their mom grew up watching this. I grew up with Muppets, Fraggle Rock and all that. This movie has great design aspects from Brian Froud and the Muppets in this movie are some of the best ever filmed. I don't typically like musicals but the musical numbers in this movie are mainly David Bowie and some Muppets. Mostly the musical numbers in this movie are like random, trippy music videos from the 1980's. This movie is still cool after all these years, the effects mostly hold up and it looks crisp on Blu-Ray.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I've been looking forward to reading this book.  I liked the first installment and was given that as a Christmas present a few years ago.  I dragged that hardcover around all 900+ pages of it.  When I got my Kindle I was excited to be able to download the second of this series however, when I saw the price I almost fell out of my chair!<br /><br />From previous reviews I'm not the only one who won't be purchasing this book.  I can't get over the price for an electronic book.  Really? I kind of have a rule about ebooks.  I won't download any book over $12.00 and if I actually pay $12.00 it's a book I absolutely have to have (I haven't downloaded any $12.00 books yet).  I thought the reason to have an electronic reader was to be able to download books at a significant discount from the actual hardcover price.  Guess that thought doesn't apply to this selection.<br /><br />Looks like I'll be asking for the hardcover for Christmas this year.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|Disney keeps putting out great editions of movies when releasing anything from Pixar on Blu-Ray, or any Hayao Miyazaki film. In regards to movies like The Rocketeer and now Hocus Pocus, they seem to not care about these films too much. While I love this movie and watch it every Autumn, this release is somewhat disappointing. Granted this movie is not some sort of artistic masterpiece of cinema, it's probably one of the, if not the best, Halloween movie you can get that isn't a horror film. The transfer is pretty clean, hardly any pops or scratches, the natural film grain is still visible which is nice, and colors are vibrant and detail is good with minimal soft edges. As other reviewers have stated, there are no special features which is total balls. If you love this movie, get it on Blu-Ray because this is the best it's gonna look for awhile I'm afraid.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and found that I didn't want to put it down.  I haven't felt this way about a book since I read \\"The Help\\".  The characters, their relationships and the story line kept me reading. The scene that is described at the beginning of the story got me hooked and kept me guessing about how the story would unfold.  The servants were powerful examples of family loyalty and strength under Mama and Papa's guidance even when faced with many challenges.  This is the type of book you read, you miss the characters when it's finished and hope there is a part 2.
B001EN71CW|5.0|There isn't anything I can say that hasn't already been said about this short lived sci-fi masterpiece. Except maybe that they need to make a Serenity sequel. Brown Coat for life yo. If you haven't seen this show, I don't know you... and I don't wanna know you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This application is great! The audio option really adds to the this app! LOVE having this on my Droid! Highly Recommend this app!
B005LAIH5O|4.0|Now this movie is the kind of movie you shouldn't expect too much from. It's a sequel to a remake of a movie from the '80's starring Harry Hamlin, I mean come on yo. With a different director than the Clash of the Titans remake, this movie still feels part of the same franchise. The visuals look great, if your a fan of the God of War series for playstation and like Greek mythology and Liam Neeson, then there is no reason you shouldn't like this movie. Pretty decent special features, I just wouldn't pay full retail price for this movie, I didn't, and I'm totally stoked with my purchase.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Definitely the best in the Robert Langdon series.  Several twists and turns that I didn't see coming made the story exceptionally interesting and compelling.  And the fact that the story takes place in the U.S. Capitol really \\"brings it home\\" for me and made it all the more enjoyable!!
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|Shaun of the Dead was the first of the Flavours Cornetto Trilogy by Edgar Wright, playing on the best aspects of a buddy movie and zombie film. This movie, Hot Fuzz, is more of a play on a buddy movie and action films. The third installment is The Worlds End, a movie about an epic pub crawl slated to come out sometime next year. Hot Fuzz for me, succeeded in taking all the cool elements of action films the same way Shaun of the Dead succeeded in playing up all the cool things done in traditional zombie films. Hot Fuzz is totally British in cast and setting and yet totally American at the same time since most of the movie is an obvious nod to American action films. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play off each other as well as they did since I first saw them in Spaced, together. Hot Fuzz pops on Blu-Ray, it retains the natural look of the film grain but is very polished with sharp detail and vibrant colors. Loaded with special features, if you don't own this on Blu-Ray, you need to. If you own it on DVD and weren't quite sure about buying it a second time, you need to upgrade to the Blu-Ray version. While there isn't any real additional content, this is one of the cleanest looking movies I've seen on Blu-Ray and is a must own in my opinion.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|Okay, so everyone has their favorite Ring. But this boxset consists of the HD telecasts from the Met  starting in October 2010 and finishing in February 2012.  If  you liked what you saw in the theaters, then you will love this on blu-ray.  The video and audio are spectacular. The cast is terrific. Just  watch the duet  between Kaufmann and Westbroek; totally believable  unlike some  other pairings on other sets.  I own 4 complete video sets of the Ring including the Bayreuth Kupfer set on laserdisc(recently released on blu-ray) and enjoy each one for different reasons. I also own the entire Solti ring on cd and a Toscanini Act 1  of Walkurie on disc.  But to me, this Ring is perfect for this era.  Some hate the \\"machine\\" but I don't even  notice  it anymore when  I am  so absorbed in the action and singing.  I have seen these in the theater; I was in a seat at opening night in 2010  for Rheingold, but the experience in a home theater with this  set  is  amazing.  I would give it 10 stars  if I could.  If you  must have traditional, then buy the last Met Ring  from  1990.  If you're looking  for avant-garde then  look here or at the Barcelona set.  Better  yet, buy them both and check out the Kupfer as well. What a choice. Who could complain  about that?
B005LAIHEA|5.0|While this may not be the funniest movie ever, it made me laugh when most \\"comedy\\" movies don't. I watched it with my girlfriend (who loved it) and I found it very charming. I was a big fan of Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Jason Segel did a great job yet again, writing a romantic comedy that is believable and funniest when portraying awkward and true to life situations. Also, this movie has a great supporting cast, Alison Brie (Community) and Chris Pratt (Moneyball) do a great job of taking stage when Jason Segel and Emily Blunt aren't the center of attention. My only complaint is that Kevin Hart was way under used in this movie, but I like that he was in it at all which was a surprise to me since they failed to mention him in any commercials they played for this movie. If you like funny, charming movies that are worth watching more than once, you should get this. Great visuals as to be expected with such a new movie, and has some pretty good sepcial features.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This has got to be one of the most poorly written, cliche-ridden pieces of garbage I ever had the misfortune of attempting to read. There is nothing about Christian Grey or his character that I found even remotely interesting. All I know about him is that he smells like body wash, his pajamas hang off his hips in \\"that way,\\" and he cocks his head to the side a lot when he talks. Equally annoying is Anastasia, whose breath \\"hitches\\" on every page and whose \\"inner goddess\\" does the samba, the Charleston and the cha-cha. My eyeballs ached from rolling them so many times. I basically flipped past the endless email exchanges and tedious dialogue to get to the more \\"adult\\" parts, which, although not bad, can't even begin to redeem the awfulness of the rest of it.<br /><br />I don't know. I couldn't get past those annoyances to give the book or the story any sort of serious consideration. The author's writing is like nails on a chalkboard. I think it's definitely a \\"win\\" for fan fiction and self-publishing. With the cash cow this has proven to be to Vintage, perhaps it can invest in a good editor before pushing crap like this out to the masses.

B008GOG98Y|5.0|When four \\"cutters\\" run afoul of college boys over a girl, they soon find themselves careening toward the ultimate face off--a prestigious cycling competition called the Little 500 on the campus of Indiana University. Though they've made a pact to waste the rest of their lives together, their struggle to prove themselves to a few frat boys soon has them breaking away toward a different kind of victory--growing up. This well-cast movie is geared-up with cycling action, humor, and relatable life issues. Breaking Away is in the peloton of cycling movies.
B008DVJO8C|4.0|it's alright.  i expected better. there are a few, good rockers on it. i listened to it twice then put it away.
B000GOZOP6|5.0|This movie is my absolute favorite in the whole wide world. The script, actors, director, and soundtrack are better than most.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|i never got it, was looking for it on kindle fire and its  not there. i dont have a cell phone that i can put that on.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I didn't want to stop reading even though I thought the dialogue and characters were not very well formed.  Kind of like a soap opera where you just need to know how it ends up. Good beach read.
B0091XRL86|4.0|this was a really cute movie that my kids loved.  It had some funny parts and I thought it had a good message about friendship.
B008AX18Y6|4.0|Joseph Anton was the alias that Salman Rushdie chose (a combination taken from Conrad and Chekhov) when he was in hiding, after being 'sentenced to death' after publication of \\"The Satanic Verses\\". On a sunny morning in London in 1989, a few months after the book had been published, a call from a BBC reporter changed his life. \\"How does it feel to know that you have been sentenced to death by the Ayatollah Khomeini?\\" she asked. With those few words, everything changed for him forever. In his Islington house, Salman Rushdie, understandably, shuttered the windows and locked the door. When he later left for an interview, he had no idea that he would not sit foot in the house again for many years...<br /><br />This memoir is always totally honest and never less than gripping, especially in the first half of this enormous book. The author discusses his education, family, relationships and his behaviour during those incredibly stressful years with immense openness. During the first two or three years of the fatwa, Rushdie was constantly on the move, reliant on his friends for places to stay. His second marriage was less than a year old at the time and already in trouble, so the stress and intrusion certainly did not help that situation either. The author was criticised, even at the time his life was in danger, by press articles claiming he was costing the country huge amounts of money, the government were imposing limits on what he was allowed to do (including how and when he could see his beloved son) and he was accused of selfishness for wanting to publish a paperback version of \\"The Satanic Verses\\" when the lives of hostages, such as Terry Waite, hung in the balance. Eventually, he would almost be blamed for being an author, for writing, for opening his mouth or putting pen to paper.<br /><br />Salman Rushdie admits frankly that many people saw him as arrogant and unrepentent during that time. He also allows that his need to be loved made him make misguided attempts at conciliation, which he later regretted. He knew little of what was going on - there were vague rumours or threats of hit squads, contracts and assassins, but he was told few details. He was simply moved again - and again and again. His freedom limited and, when he rebelled, he was told simply, \\"If you want to live, you will move.\\" Much changed for the author, and the world, during that time. There were major world events and huge social changes. Rushdie tells how he wrote his first book on a computer, instead of a typewriter, during those years.<br /><br />As a book, it has to be admitted, that the first half is certainly the most interesting. I certainly enjoyed reading about his early years and how he strived to become a successful author. The news of the death sentence and how the author reacted to it is certainly both shocking and gripping to read about. This is a very important book for those who recall the furore caused, so long ago, by a novel. I was quite young in 1989, in my first job, and I recall the huge outpouring of rage and hate that swept the country at the time. There was a real threat - bookshops were firebombed around the world and those who had translated the book were attacked (in one case killed). I did doing something I never did then, which was to buy a hardback copy of a book (too expensive on my low wage at that time) and that book was, of course, \\"The Satanic Verses\\". As the author says, \\"The freedom to write is closely related to the freedom to read\\". As we do not wish to be told what we can read - as we, as readers, feel we have the right to read whatever we want, then authors have to have the freedom to write those books for us. As a reader I am grateful for the stand this author took, which took immense bravery and which he tells with a great deal of humour (his brief attempt at using a wig as a disguise is priceless) and humility. This is a book you will be glad that you have read and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.conciliation, which he later regretted.

B004OKFISQ|5.0|The record, insert, and album cover arrived unopened and in perfect condition.  The sound quality is superb, the record itself shines beautifully, and this fantastic album is an enjoyable listen from start to finish, with no songs one would want to skip.
B008OOYALE|4.0|TeamLava did an excellent job on this game; however Amazon needs to do better. The kindle version of this app is poorly done, many important features such as the goal system are missing. Also a recent update to the game called The New Dawn is not available for kindle, hopefully it will be in the future.
0345803493|1.0|Into the middle of book 2 and the writers style is just annoying.  The repetitiveness of phrases, observations and feelings and sexual encounters is just cumbersome.  If I see \\"clamber\\" or \\"his breath hitched\\" one more time I will scream. I do enjoy the story line, simplistic as it is. Would like to see more depth in the story line, more adventure and danger.  Yes, WHERE WAS THE EDITOR? I'm assuming this is the author's first attempt at publication and hopefully she will take note and improve her writing style.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|It's a great game and would recommend it to anyone.  My only complaint would be the campaign is too short.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I purchased the book based on my interests in the War on Terrorism and US government responses to the terrorism.  The publicity this book generated was overblown and it caused severe and wrongful negative reactions from the leaders in Washington.  To me, there is nothing in the book that should give the nation any embarrassment on the international scene.  Threats to prosecute the author are ridiculous and simply silly.  I don't recommend the book to everyone but to those with historical interests similar to mine.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Some of his work is top notch so well written and richly produced, that it makes up for his lackluster stuff. He's got an interesting life story and point of view to choose from.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|this is a good spin on a classic style block drop game.  The added complexity by adding the numbers for every drop gives this game a little something to think about for every drop.  This makes it really good for kids learning or honing their basic math skills.<br /><br />It also helps tremendously that there are no added permissions required for this app at all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it! sometimes you'll have to force close it when you open it but otherwise its amazing and loads fast and smooth while browsing.
B000003TAW|5.0|Almost 20 years later, and still almost perfect.  Every song tells a story and no two stories are the same.  The very definition of power-pop, pop-punk, alterna-pop, or whatever other genre you can think of.
B008XG1X18|5.0|ive cooked tons of new meals, made new crafts, found decorating ideas and exercise tips all from regular people.I love pinterest!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I already had the B&W version which is, while challenging, still a lot of fun. Adding color into the mix added to the challenge and increased the fun. Playing on my phone has the extra challenge of fat fingers dealing with teeny-tiny squares but, while pinching increases the size of the squares, it reduces the amount of the playing field visible at any time. On my Galaxy Tab it is a lot easier, although still has challengingly small squares to deal with, but at least enlarging the game leaves more playing field in view. This is a function of playing the game on a small screen and not necessarily a negative of the game itself. No matter where you play the game, as you go up the levels and more squares are added, the smaller the squares have to be to fit into the same playing area. I highly recommend the game, as long as people appreciate the fact we cannot transcend the laws of physics, as you add elements into a set area those elements have to get smaller in order to fit.
B007MS5B6Q|4.0|If your already looking at this then you have already seen the reviews of the show. The Blu ray picture quality is nice if not a bit grainy and I would of liked a bit more extras. I am very happy with the season 2 set. Now on to the head! I am very pleased wit the head and it's almost life size proportions. I would say it's about the size of a nine year olds kids head. This will look amazing on your shelf. The head is kind of made out of a plastic,rubber Halloween like mask material glued to a hard plastic frame. If I had to nit pick I would of wished the eye was a bit more detailed,the paint job on the pupil and iris looks like two paint blobs on top of each other. I would of liked it to have a more realistic eye and a clear plastic gloss finish. I wish the teeth were a bit more detailed as well, perhaps a hard plastic and the same kind of gloss. The teeth are kind of rubbery like a mask. The screw driver could of been a bit more solid, as it feels hollow. That's nit picking and compared to a Blu ray set of this proportion this cant be beat for the price. I am very happy with this purchase. Just don't expect movie prop quality with this awesome price.
B000I8ES70|5.0|Mila jovovich at her best as Alice. These movies have totaled 4 to sat with a new one on the way. Apocalypse is by far one of the best so far.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Loved it. Plot is solid and fast moving, characters are believable and (surprisingly in some cases) lovable, to the point of making me wanto to move to Wyoming straight away when I hate the cold. Well written as well, can't wait to read his next one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty is indeed much darker! Can't get enough of this series. I have read it 3 times and each time I learn something that I missed before.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Hoping there's more to this series! I absolutely loved it! Although some situations are over the top, it's what really kept me reading!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Awesome book! Gillian Flynn is a wonderful author. After reading her other book Gone Girl, I was on a hunt to find another thriller read. Sharp Objects is a is a book about a young professional writer brought back to her home town to investage some murderer that reciently happened. This book take you formal ride as it Riggs deeper into the main characters life,  along with her secrets.
B00846REIS|2.0|Title says it all!!! Way to many similarities to the Grey Trilogy :( Was very disappointed, but would have liked it, if I didn't read the Greay books
B009329Y30|5.0|The Lucky One is amazing.  I watched it three times in a row then watched a little bit before I went to work. I told my husband I want this movie for Christmas or my birthday.  I love the movie because of the number of subjects it covers.  From the soldier trying to adjust to being back in the \\"real\\" world.  Taking steps to thank the woman who \\"saved\\" him while he was at war. A young divorsed mother that is trying to test a good example for her son as well as trying to run a business.  On top of that she is dealing with the loss of her brother. A little boy trying to make his father proud and never being able to do so. An angry hateful man that tried to make his father happy as a little boy and grew up to be just as hateful to his son as his dad was/is to him.  A grandmother still living her life after having a stroke.  Trying to stay out of her grandaughters way and letting her negotiate her own life, finally has enough and tells her what she needed to hear long ago.  Finally two people meet with no intentions of falling in love but, are so attracted to one another they can't seem to stay apart and when they are apart they can't stop thinking about each other.  This man also is the example of the man the woman has always wanted for her little boy.<br /><br />Guys if you want to make your wife melt during a romatic weekend, I would suggest making sure you watch this movie just before bed.
B008602KQI|3.0|This movie didn't really connect with me, it was alright and entertaining but I would of rathered watching something dubbed with a cheesy plot.

B006GM8NXM|5.0|I must admit that I wasn't on the true blood bandwagon from the beginning.<br />But after watching the first episode I was hooked! It is definately different than any other vampire show/movie out there. It has alot of the vampire myths plus a few new ones that I've never heard of. I just finished watching season 3 and about to start season 4! Hopefully I can finish in time for when season 5 starts!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Well im sure everyone by now has heard that its great. You cant put it down. And there IS an underlying love story that makes it so hard to put down. Its not just all sex/pornography that some prudes say it is.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I didn't think such a simple approach to a game would have such a fun challenge. The first iteration was amazingly fun, and this one managed to top that. I have spent many hours playing both versions of this game and I never walk away from either with the feeling that my time was wasted, even if i was supposed to be working. The design and layout are simplistic and easy to understand, while still providing enough of a challenge that you don't feel like a 2 year old finger-painting flowers. I actually have to uninstall it every now and then to keep me from playing it when I have other things to do. This is a game that is worth your time and money. Great game!
B0091REZMW|5.0|the game isncool...tons of quests....for free!! just wished energy would fill up fast!! if ya love hidden objects this is it!!
B001EIOOVS|2.0|Not up to expectations.  We had heard thru friends that it was excellent, but we didn't think so at all, hence only 2 stars from us.  Denzel Washington was very good though.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|this is a good game.. only problem is I had to redownload the game because of updated version.. I lost everything!!!!!! I even spent 20 bucks on the game... 1 star now...
B008CP93S0|1.0|All right folks if you decide to view Wanderlust be prepared for dissapointment. This movie has all the components to be a good flick. You have two super hot female leads in Jennifer Aniston and Malik Ackerman, addPaul Rudd and this movie should be hilarious. The only problem is the plot is terrible, and the dialogue is worse. You never connect with any of the characters except for Rudds brother whos name escapes me at the moment but he is the sole reason i give this movie 1 star instead of a big zero. Do yourselves a favor and do not watch this movie because it stinks. After reading this you can't say you were never warned.<br />Honestly Yours,<br />Jesse from Jersey
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book gives an excellent account of the life of our special forces.  The hard work they do and the lack of thanks that they get.  Read it to learn of some of the men that risk their lives for our safety.
B006RXQ3GO|2.0|This was not the entire film.  It was missing several scenes that were in the original release.  I am somewhat disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good app. Some games are super addicting. wish it was a little faster. can be super slow and acts up sometimes
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked the three books and the author was very good in the presentation and conclusion.  What else to say, if you liked the other books by this author then you will like this one.
B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|Cute, somewhat challenging, somewhat frustrating, not nearly so as Angry Birds.  Played it once, haven't really been interested to go back to it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I ordered the Kindle version so I could begin reading it Monday at midnight. It was such a good read, I was done by mid-morning.  I made a comment on Huffington Post that I did not see what all the fuss was about and you would have thought I said that George Washington was a commie. Sorry, but I still don't see what all the fuss was about. Okay, I get that he signed a non-disclosure agreement but calling him a traitor is just way over the line.  His stated objective was to tell the story the way it happened and show appreciation for the organization he loved.  He succeeded. He maintains his view that the story was not about him, but about the team.  It is so obvious how much \\"Owen\\" loved and respected his team-mates.  The complaints by others included that he gave away tactics and secrets to \\"the enemy\\".  Sorry, don't see it.  The only \\"secret\\" I even knew about came from the media soon after the raid: that the Blackhawks had stealth technology which is why we wanted the tail section back lest the Chinese get ahold of it. Owen made no mention of this at all.  As to tactics?  Give me a break. I am no military expert, but he didn't tell me, or anyone else, anything we didn't already know.  As a read, it could not have been more smooth and engaging.  I literally read it in one sitting. The flag-wavers can scream \\"Treason\\", but I thought he honored the team.
B0061PEAUY|2.0|This was one of Ms Reich's less interesting stories.  It has the same old characters, the same old conflicts, and the same old \\"damsel in distress\\" ending.  The \\"shocking\\" crime is poorly explained.  It's time to end this series.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought this book was very good. Not quite as good as the first, but still very entertaining. At the very least I had to buy book three to see how it ends.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|cool game at first... but it's a pain in the you know what that it doesn't have levels that you can accomplish without reverting back to the beginning. It gets redundant starting from the beginning EVERY time which then makes it seem boring.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was a little disappointing. Too far=fetched and complicated. The trip through the capital city was actually a little boring.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I really liked this book right up to the last word.  Kept me guessing all the time.  Well written.  And thought-provoking.
B0083SBMBM|2.0|I have yet to see The Avengers, sad to say.  I was really looking forward to getting the DVD.  But now, why bother?  I'll rent it via the LIBRARY for free because NOTHING is coming with it!  Why do all the extras only come out on blue-ray?  What gives?  I don't have a blue-ray and nor do I plan to.  This DVD should cost $10 TOPS because that is all you are getting - THE MOVIE.  What a rip off!  And why include all the extras in different formats?  How hard can it be to add an extra dvd with all the extras?!  I hope someone uploads them onto youtube for me.  I love watching gag reals and \\"making of\\".<br /><br />Really disappointed here.
1844486524|5.0|I checked this out at the library as I generally do with all my craftsy type books and I really liked it...enough to order my own copy! The one at the library was spiral bound and pages kept slipping out. The book I got here in Amazon was a standard paperback which I definitely prefer! The directions are great and it is a lot of fun to create some of my own cords for necklaces and such! I really like the step-by-step diagrams and how each item will reference you to the technique page you need. It covered not just simple braids but Kumihimo, weaving and the use of beads in many different aspects of the cords! Hardest part for me was that the given amount is only for 12 inches so I have to stop and do the math to ensure I make enough of a cord...but that's not such a huge thing really :)
B005K17RU0|4.0|the radar is great, the layout is great, the only thing that'd make it better is if they'd fix the app for kindle fire.  it locks up sometimes when zooming in on the radar map,  you have to power down to reset. a landscape option would be nice too. overall I recommend.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Too much \\"ground-laying\\" and not enough substance.  The wrap-up was hasty and the ending was singularly unsatisfying -- I was left feeling that a good opportunity had been wasted.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I love John Grisham and this book is a classic.  A little on the tame side, but always informative and accurate.  Again, i dont think these reviews need to be 20 words.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book brings you inside the mission without varnish, showing what the men who make up our front line are like - a truly professional force, but a human one too. Prior service members will definitely 'get it.' The pride that comes from within of completing necessary hard work for this country shows in this book. I found it a very candid first-hand account. Claims that this book 'reveals secrets' I believe are over-rated. It does show the make-up of the SEAL, and matches my experiences with the ones I've come in contact with on occasion in my 20 year career in the Navy. Well done!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The president and his cronies revealed more than what's in this book. Sounds like bit of a slap at the pres and his bunch by the seals. It's evident they think the pres is an idiot and too much loose talk from the politicians. Thank God for our special ops guys. Sorry to hear the upper brass is not standing up for these guys. Nothing like getting your ticket punched.<br /><br />Robert
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Felt like I was really there, with all the detail she puts in.  Fascinating story, and makes perfect sense, even the areas she admits she has embellished.  We will never know for sure, but it sure feels right to me!
B005OLUOVA|3.0|I say this as a longtime, diehard fan. This (Super Delux Edition) is a glorified greatest hits release. The remixes and 'fancy packaging' are not worth the extra cash.<br /><br />I've owned this set for 10 months. I did not have the dupe disc issue. My critique comes to the metal 'box'.<br /><br />The metal portion of the package is a very simple stamped piece, with unfinished edges, and bare metal finish. In my living room, on a shelf, proudly displayed with my red Singles Kollection box, it has already begun to rust. RUST! Indoors, climate controlled. Love these guys, but I'm a little let down by this set.
0345803493|4.0|This book was different then the first, the direction, and feel all together. I did like the book, but the first book had a more consistent flow for my interest. This one was very hot and cold. One minute I couldn't wait to see what was next and was excited or on edge, the next, it was almost boring. The end left me wanting to see what will happen next, and I really do like the style of writing in these books. I still recommend reading it.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I am new to smart phones and this app has made it a lot easier than I thought.  I use it a lot because I need to write things down quite a bit. It really makes my work easier.<br />Thanks.
B0000521G4|5.0|There are those movies, books, or TV shows, that bring your childhood back to you in a rush.  American Graffiti is one of those movies.  I remember how many times I saw this when I was young.  I loved it so much then.  There was something about the constant, echo-y soundtrack, the way the film was made - almost a documentary style, that just worked well together.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that after over 30 years the movie still holds up.  There's just something magical about it.  The cast is perfect.  The dialogue is well written.  The movie is tightly edited.  It propels you along, despite its very episodic structure. It grabs you emotionally.  And even though it's set in the late fifties it resonates as a really good representation of youth.  When you look around at the world of 2012 it truly reminds you of a time when life was simpler and maybe a little more real and present.<br /><br />Highly recommended for old and young viewers.
B006WB7IN8|5.0|Wasn't quite sure what to expect but couldn't put it down and so well written. The story line was plausible and the characters real, good research on OCD. Quite a while since I read a book this gripping, last one comparable in this genre was a Jeffery Deaver and that was many years ago. Never done a review before !
B00846REIS|4.0|50 Shades doesn't hold a candle to Bared to You.  This book is not only sexy with again a rich, powerful male.  It also has a tough female lead, who even though she has many demons, she's not a doormat.  These two people are intensley attracted to each other. Their love making is erotic not raunchy.  They are both flawed, but not without hope.  As abuse survivors their characters are developed slowly, but clearly.  You care about them and want to know more about them.  There is a plot and an on-going story line.  When I read 50 Shades, I kept screaming \\"where's the editor\\".  In 50 shades if you take out all the repetition, the book would only be about 16 pages long.  Bared to You, is much better and I am looking forward to next book.  In fact I have pre-ordered it.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|costumes and cinematography  are great.  The deeper intellectual underpinnings were smoothed over  when they had the potential to go Brazil-deep in it's dystopian construct.  But very enjoyable and will see the next one, although I wont see it in the theatre, but rather in the HD comfort of my living room.
B008CP93S0|4.0|Crazy comedy about two city folks struggling in their relationship and environment, having to drive to Atlanta to ask Paul Rudd's obnoxious brother for a job. They stop for the night on the way down and end up in a hippie commune where folks like to live off the land and run around naked a lot. Place is a little too strange for Paul and Jennifer Aniston, so they pack up and go to Atlanta. Job sucks, brother makes life miserable, so they go back to Elysian Fields, and get caught up in the very funny lifestyle. A struggle over the property(owned by Alan Alda and several co-founders of the place)ensues, the couple gets back together and they help save the day. You will enjoy if you like broad humor, slapstick, and Jennifer going topless on the news to gain attention for the property battle. I might be a little bias in liking this film, because I appear in a cameo as one of the co-founders, Jerry Beaver.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An excellent chronicling of the Bin Laden encounter, with strong foundational material on Navy Seals and the related core groups.  The authors at times used unnecessary salty language, but the overall thrust of the book, and its narrative, was thoroughly captured.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Another satisfying story. But I'll have to go back to find out if I missed some explanation on how Susan could ENTER England w/Kate's passport, even though leaving the US was easier? And why did Lane & company let Reacher leave the house and property (at the climax of story) without killing him?
B007FH9GA6|5.0|This movie will keep you guessing the entire time. Great cast, good mix of action and suspense, and interesting characters. Just buy it because once you watch it, you'll want to watch it again!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest app is much easier to use than the real website.  I enjoy the ease of toggling from tab to tab.
B0060D0R2C|4.0|I really liked this movie, it wasn't easy to predict where it was going to go and it made you pay attention.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Reading this account it is still amazing to me the level of professionalism of these individuals.  Mark does an excellent job of pulling back the curtain on a secret world where you can be eating tacos in the drive-through parking lot one minute and then jet set to the war zone at a moment's notice. Remarkably humble, the story walks you through the career of a Navy SEAL. It is not glitzy, it is not glamorous. There is no fame, no heroes, no ticker tape parade. Just a group of highly motivated individuals who have a job and they execute with extreme prejudice, and then return home just like the rest of us. Only this mission was different, and the return home was very different.  Now all the news shows lead with an account of their mission.  The ability to separate the mission over seas from the quiet life at home got blurred and as a result we got this first hand account of what actually happened on that fateful day.  Mark has taken a great risk to share this account, but I am grateful for his service and his story. Thank you, Mark.
B0018Q4DTY|5.0|Classic, classic Outkast.  For me, the easiest of all their albums to listen to all the way through (I ALWAYS skip Mamacita on Aquemini)and I don't know anyone who doesn't get caught up in its groove.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This book is pretty straightforward...a participants account of the OBL takedown. That part, which comprises the last 15% or so of the book, is interesting simply because we all want to know exactly what happened that night. Most of the book, however, is not about the raid in Abbottabad, but a retelling of one SEAL's career and experiences in the navy. Interesting stuff, but not compelling.<br /><br />I am a bit frustrated that the Kindle editions of \\"blockbuster\\" books such as this are so expensive, especially since I can't lend the book out. My recommendation: it's worth a read, but get it at the library, or borrow from a friend who purchased a hard copy. It's an interesting story, but it's not \\"must read now at any price\\" stuff.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Tom is mission impossible, top of the world to this film, GOT ACTION, and Paula is all that and then some , good addition.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Follows the story but leaves a lot to be desired in developing relationships between characters. Shaky camera is awful and she in no way looks like she's scraping by or had a hard life.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I found John Locke's book to be informative and inspirational. I appreciated the many examples he gave from his own experiences, using his own books as examples. His book changed the way I thought about selling and marketing e-books. Since reading his book and applying his principles, my book sales have more than doubled. I have recommended the book to all of my writing friends, and bought and gifted the book to several just starting out.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the games that are on here. There are some games that I like better than others.  The ones I like I play more of course.  I am always trying to get enough points to open another game.  I play this game everyday.

0393316041|5.0|Lively, funny, twisting, turning anecdotes with a little science hidden inside, SURELY YOU'RE JOKING, MR. FEYNMAN will keep you reading and looking forward to the next short chapter.  I read this book over the last two weekends and am surprised at how many quotes I remember, not to mention the new practical jokes available to me.  I can't wait to remove someone's door the next time they tell me to be sure to close it and leave behind a sign with those words, though I don't think I have a future in safe-cracking, an inside joke that only people who have read the book will understand.  Highly recommended... - lc

B007ZZ3RI0|5.0|Had heard about Adam's new album when he was being interviewed on television and read the interview in the Advocate but was pleasantly surprised that the album was even better than I thought it would be. Lambert has really pumped out a great new album of dance and pop which is a change from his rock pop last album. Keep up the great work Adam!
B008XBHBX2|5.0|In a word:  WOW!!!  I have always loved Jaws....but this new \\"Hi-Def\\" version is AWESOME!  It is spectacular, just crystal clear!  I plan on purchasing the Blu-Ray of this version ASAP!  This is THE BEST restoration of a film to Hi-Def I've EVER seen.  Trying to get a friend to upgrade to blu-ray?  Watch THIS with them...they will see what they've been missing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A fast read with lots of twists and turns. Holes in the plot make it a little unbelievable. The main character is a piece of work.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Heard alot of hype about this film.....seemed to be a favorite of the younger generation.  I decided to check it out....and was glad I did!  Very interesting story.....kinda gave me flashbacks to \\"Running Man\\", sort of where society in the future falls back to a more barbaric form of entertainment.  Great acting and well-written characters.  My 13 yr old talked me into renting it....and I'm glad I did!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so addictive!! has hours and hours of casual play... great graphics in 3d and great sound. 5 stars Kindle Fire.
B006HTUZ1C|1.0|I would have liked to play the game if it actually responded to taps to rotate pieces, but instead it ignores those and frequently interprets swipes as taps. If it worked, I would have rated it much higher, but as it is impossible to play, it gets the lowest rating I can give.
B00846REIS|5.0|Ok, so I'm one of those who loved Fifty, but I would have to say this book was just as good to me. It did take a while to get into, but once I did I was hooked! Patiently waiting for next book!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great book. I have read all 3 and have recommend it to all of my friends and family. I am a mom of 2 and still found time to read all 3 books in less than 3 weeks. Could not put it down. It is a well written book and I think that all women and men should read this book. I found out somethings about myself in this book. READ IT
B002DJSBMA|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theatre because at that point in time I'd have gone to see anything starring Brad Pitt.  What a revelation the movie turned out to be!  Pitt's performance blew me away.  I wouldn't have given odds that he could hold his own against mega-talent Anthony Hopkins, but it was a match made in Heaven.  The basic story line is that Hopkins' character, a successful man who is the head of a powerful corporation as well as of a close-knit family, is having symptoms of an incipient heart attack.  Pitt, who plays \\"Death\\", takes the body of a young man, and decides to strike a deal...he will delay Hopkins' demise, and in exchange he will be a guest in Hopkins home and world.  Death wants to experience human life. Before Death makes an appearance, Pitt (as the young man whose body is later co-opted by Death) meets Hopkins' favorite daughter in a random way, over coffee, and both experience strong instant attraction.  When Pitt (no longer the very human young man but a remote and other-worldly essence who is using his body) shows up at her father's house during a family dinner, her confusion is tempered by the fact she still is attracted...but now wonders what happened to the likable guy she'd met earlier.<br />  Brad Pitt's dual portrayals; first of the charming and good-natured guy in the coffee shop, then contrasted with the very non-human consciousness of \\"death\\" masquerading as a human being is nothing short of astonishing.  This was the movie that convinced me Brad Pitt could really ACT.  He is utterly different as each character, although in both he is outwardly a very attractive young man in a business suit.  It's in his eyes that you see the shattering difference...and realize when you look into them that there is nothing human looking out, as \\"Death\\".  I remember being awestruck in the theatre, and thinking, \\"Where did he PULL that from????\\"  How does one develop a character that is essentially inhuman, immortal and still frighteningly beautiful?  It was a masterful job of acting!<br />  Anthony Hopkins, as the man whose remaining life is under the control of Death, is brilliant, as always.  In his role as a father, a corporate leader, and then as a father fighting for the life of his daughter (Death has fallen in love with his daughter, and she with him; Hopkins must make Death develop human love and morality, in order to convince him not to \\"take her with me\\" when they depart for Death's true domain)...he uses all the talent and skills we expect of him.  His portrayal is achingly human and rises to our highest expectations.<br />  Along with a stunning supporting cast..each character fully developed and unerringly portrayed...I always thought this movie didn't get half the buzz it deserved.  It's one I will happily watch again and again.[[ASIN:0783233477 Meet Joe Black]]ful?

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an awesome read. It is a very insightful approach to human relationships in marriage. Lots of twist and very smart.
B003UN409Q|5.0|The memoir of one of the most unique rock bands of the 60's, The Doors (starring Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison) is spot on.  From humble beginnings to super-stardom; from success to despair; and ultimately from life to death, this is Jim Morrison's life story.  Val Kilmer is brilliant as Morrison.  I read somewhere that during filming he immersed himself so deeply in the role that a note was passed around the set instructing everyone to address him as \\"Jim\\" at all times, off-camera as well as on.  He went deep into the psyche of his character and it shows.  I also saw an interview with one of the existing former members of the Doors, who said that in some scenes, watching Kilmer play Jim onstage gave him chills...he felt as if he was watching Jim, for real.  If you loved the Doors, or if you just want to see an amazing job of acting by Kilmer as Jim, and Meg Ryan as his lovely muse, Patricia, you'll love this movie.  And the music (some songs sung by Kilmer as Jim...and you won't find it objectionable, I assure you!) is great, too![[ASIN:B003UN409Q The Doors]]
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This time I saw the movie before reading the book and still the book is way better. Very quick to the point and entertaining. Also not a typical love story which I really enjoyed ;)

B000028U0Y|5.0|You will be pleased with this record.<br />Live from Folsom Prison.<br />Great Songs.<br />These are not your everyday Johnny Cash songs that you will find in Johnny's Number One hits.<br />But if you like Johnny's deep voice you will enjoy these and the price is not that expensive.<br />I bought this album for a friend at work and liked it so much that I bought a copy for myself.<br />Even though the recordings are LIVE, they are still studio quality.<br />The songs are fitting for prisoners.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Must admit that I didn't see certain twists coming. As I read, I cringed at the sociopathic ideas and behaviors presented, wondering if such thoughts should be introduced to a young or weak mind.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app.  I do so much on my kindle fire I forget it needs to charged.  The battery HD keeps me well informed of the life I have left.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|While the story takes place entirely in Canada, Ryan is back and things could be starting again.  Quick read.  Not as much blood and gore but a very interesting story and backdrop.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|Terrific movie!  Lots of action, and is fast paced.  Even if you're not a train freak, THIS is a good movie.  Based on a true incident--- it's scarey to think about.<br /><br />The runaway engine seems to have a life force of its own.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you see/buy this movie.  Denzel Washington is great, and for Trekkie fans, Chris Pine (Played Capt. Kirk as a young man in the last Star Trek) is great too.

B004FEFS5E|5.0|Bryan Peterson is not only a great photographer, he is a wonderful communicator and instructor. I read this book first and then took the course he offers online by the same name. I love that he doesn't get overly technical, but presents often difficult to understand concepts in a friendly and easy to grasp manner. My photography skills and resulting images are dramatically improved as a result of Bryan's coaching through this book and the class. I think everyone interested in taking good photographs, whether for fun or profit, should have this book in their library. The pages should be worn out from frequent use and referring back to specific topics as a refresher.<br /><br />Thank you Bryan for putting such a great tool in my hands.<br /><br />Craig

B00846TRHY|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this true story about a man who changed his life and then seriously began to consider whether he was doing all he could to help in this world.  This newfound conviction led him to help orphans of the civil war in Sudan.  After watching this, my husband and I have given much more thought about what we can do to help others as well.  It's an excellent movie with quality writing, directing, and acting, as well as wonderful cinematography.  I would highly recommend it to any adult.  This movie is gritty and realistic, however, with coarse language and graphic scenes of violence, so I would advise parents to use discretion in allowing children to watch it.  Personally, I don't think I'd let anyone under twelve view this film.

0984725113|1.0|This book is an opinion piece based on a very narrow segment of technology. It lacks quantitative analysis and makes ill informed statements about economic history and the history of technology. The arguments are based on examples more so than facts, and there is no real economic analysis.  Oversimplified, the theme of the book is that communications and information technology (CIT) and automation are accelerating and the productivity gains are happening faster than jobs can be created and this is resulting in structural unemployment. Also, because of Moore's law and creativity, CIT's best days are just around the corner. The authors base their argument on several promising developments in CIT, none of which are profound. After all, computers have been around for half a century (and tabulating machines a half century before computers) and a more rational economic argument is that the most promising opportunities have already been exploited. Automation was widespread in industry before computers were developed.  The authors inject some technologies from economic history, like the steam engine and electricity, to which they compare the CIT revolution in importance; however, many of their statements are unsupported. Here is a good example: &#34;In the 21st century technological change is both faster and more pervasive&#34;.  This technological unemployment argument is also known as the Luddite fallacy. It is an old economic argument going back to before the Industrial Revolution when agricultural workers were driven off the land by increasing productivity.  The displaced workers lived a miserable life and many starved, but eventually as food prices fell jobs in towns and cities grew as people had more income to spend on non food goods and services.  By 1800 a spinning mule could do the work of 1000 wheel spinners and smaller gains were made in weaving. (How many robots using spinning wheels would it have taken to replace one spinning mule?) The Luddites of the 1810s smashed textile machinery because of job losses.  Yet the economy continued to expand as prices fell.  A decade later threshing machines had eliminated a large amount of agricultural labor.  In the late 1830s to 1843 there was a severe depression due in part to saturation of the textile market.  As the economy was recovering Frederick Engels Wrote the Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844. In 1848 Marx and Engels wrote The Communist Manifesto.  In 1892 Engels wrote that the bad living conditions of 1844 had largely disappeared.  The Luddite fallacy is a fallacy because reducing costs increases consumption, limited by diminishing marginal utility.  This is where new products and services are important- they create new demand.  The main shortcoming of the book is failure to provide a sufficient economic argument against the Luddite fallacy, that is: how is CIT economically different from past labor saving innovations in it's effect on prices and the development of new products and services?  The period of the greatest economic and productivity growth of the West was from the beginning of the 20th century until the 1960s, but the major changes occurred with electrification and internal combustion transport.  After the 1960s productivity sagged, despite the increasing use of computers.  Although there was a revival in the 1990s, productivity growth remained below the peak of the early to middle decades.  Automation is nothing new.  Factories, ships and airplanes were automated with analog feedback controllers beginning in the 1930s.  The basis of automation is control theory, which was a development of mathematics a long time in the making.  My view it that technological unemployment is driven by the fact that economic processes that improve productivity of non-labor and non-capital inputs, e.g. energy efficiency, are approaching limits, while computers are displacing labor.  Also, new products and services are not adding enough new jobs.  The great innovations of the past (railways, steam power, electrification) were able to dramatically lower costs, which increased demand.  (Railroads lowered transportation costs by over 95% and mechanization of agriculture, fertilizer and improved seeds lowered the cost of agricultural products by a similar magnitude.  Ten cents worth of electricity can do more physical work than a man can do in a day.)  A few problems now are: 1). Technology is no longer able to significantly reduce costs over wide segments of the economy because the economic sectors where technology increases productivity, such as agriculture and manufacturing, shrank themselves almost out of existence. 2). Most markets are saturated. 3) Energy efficiency has increased by such a large percentage that it is impossible to repeat such gains.  For the impact of globalization on manufacturing employment see the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation's paper &#34;Worse than the Great Depression: What Experts are missing about American Manufacturing Decline&#34;.  Update: I am reading Robert. J Gordon's <i>The Rise and Fall of American Growth</i> which discusses the declining impact of information and communications technologies on economic growth.  I would recommend anyone wanting a general economy perspective read Gordon.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I loved this game on the computer. I haven't played it in months due to many things but now that it is on my Kindle, I can finally play one of my favorite games again! I don't understand the bad reviews where they cant play it on their kindle, the price is high, and the game wont download. The game works fine on my kindle and loaded faster than most apps, Notch put the price of the computer version as 20$ where as this costs 7$, so stop giving crape about Notch when he evencquit working on minecraft and made Jen the main producer.

B008I3QZKU|1.0|As the first reviewer of Hot Fuss 8 years ago, I wrote that The Killers reminded me of an American Franz Ferdinand.  While that was a compliment at the time, unfortunately my love for Franz Ferdinand only lasted two albums, much like my love for The Killers.  This album is boring.  I absolutely love the first two albums, and even Day & Age had its moments, but this sounds very uninspired. I'm glad it's my roommate who bought this so I didn't have to waste my money.  Please don't waste your money, too.

B004LOMB2Q|1.0|For whatever reason, as soon as I purchased the pay-for version of this product, it stopped allowing me to upload PDF files from my phone. Also, it is annoying that you can only download and/or print one file at a time to your computer. Google docs is free, has faster uploads/downloads, and none of these other annoyances. Just use Google docs and save yourself time, frustration, and money.

B000SEGUDE|4.0|I heard this novel is about to release as a Film with major stars such as Tom Hanks and Halle Berry and directed by Andy and Lana Wachowski and Tom Tykwer.  Since the Wachowski's make powerful movies, and Tom Hanks is selective about which scripts he chooses, I decided to give the book a read.<br /><br />As a read, it's a challenge. It covers a broad expanse of time with story-lines (plural) interwoven through time, geography, and political/sociological imagination with no real explanation of the novelist David Mitchell's intention- it jump starts and grabs the reader.<br /><br />The reader is catapulted into a story in progress, expected to catch up and at the same time decode the vernacular of the text, language which includes many words not commonly used, with \\"common\\" spellings of some words (based on historic period usage) which are a challenge.  Having said Cloud Atlas is a challenging read, I also say I was riveted by the twisty/turning story - rushing from chapter to chapter, enjoying how the story was braided together from beginning to end - through time.<br /><br />The characters are fascinating, the culture complex and as frustrating as today's current economic landscape, and when I finished the read - the flavor of the story continues to resonate in my mind.  Now I can't wait to see how they translate it to the big screen.

B00102F5WK|1.0|Unfortunately, this DVD was damaged in shipping so was unable to view entire film.  What I was able to see was TERRIBLE.  Far beneath the talent of Meryl Streep.  Most of the dialogue was in Arabic with NO English captions so you had no idea what the actors were saying nor talking about.  I was quite surprised that an actress of Meryl Streeps stature would even dignify this \\"piece of crap\\" with her presence!!!
B0058UXHHK|5.0|The character Rose, I felt really bad for her situation with her mom. I mean right away the author gets your attention when Rose is a suspect in her mother's murder. You really feel for Rose and what she had to go through during this trying time of her life. You got to admire her strength and determination to clear her name. And I liked that the author wondering about Joe, is he good or bad guy. I liked her farty dog character too! I liked the ending, never would have guess that it was her boss.
B00932ANQM|1.0|This movie has to be one of the worst movies of all time.  I don't know where to begin.  The plot is fragmented and ridiculous.  The guy walked from where, Colorado to Louisiana and found a specific woman with a photograph without any other clues?  The acting is bad.. the script is bad.. the plot is stupid...<br /><br />Did I miss anything?

B0014EU5XI|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of ZZ Top, although I was in high school when they hit the zenith of their popularity with the Eliminator and Afterburner albums. I do, on occasion, like to hear a little crunchy guitar, however, and this set is a great overview of their career. My only caveat is that the versions of La Grange and Tush appear to be the later re-records with the less airy and powerful drum tracks. They sound like they were run through Dolby too many times. Anyway, an excellent collection. Especially at the 4.99 that I paid for it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I've read that the author will be shunned by fellow Seals, etc.  Are they aware the profits from this book go to Seals in need?  While  what they do is normally secret, Obama blew that when he announced the Seal Team 6 was involved.  The President , whether knowingly, or ignorantly, put targets on each one of the members of the team.  He should be shunned, or at least not reelected for the danger he has put the men in, not this author who is trying to put the record straight.  Anyway, it was an entertaining read, answered a lot of questions, and gave insight into the sacrifices these men make for their country.''There perhaps would have been no need to write this book if the Obama White House had not exposed too many details, already.  Also kudos to the staffwho worked for years to get the information that was finally acted upon.  The woman mentioned, who had worked a decade on this project  deserves all of our admiration.  I hope and pray that Obama doesn't give out her name at any point, she doesn't need a target on her back!<br /><br />I owuld  recommend reading it just to be knowledgeable about the way the mission really went down.  I hope the book makes a lot of money to help Seals.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|Split Second brings the characters back together with a lot of past history.  The story is interesting revealing the author's complex mind for the mystery format.  The story however is not up to his usual standards although remaining entertaining for the most part.

B007R41E8O|4.0|Twisted Lands, Shadow Town isn't a new game. Just a few minutes in I realized I'd played it on the big screen PC. But long ago enough to not remember all the moves. This is an abreviated version. In the PC game I had a heck of a time getting the gangway up. This time was just push a of button.<br /><br />Overall a fun, interesting game full of false clues, good but wierd story line, and a surprise ending.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Poorly written but captivating and becomes somewhat boring because it is soooo repetitious. The third book has better writing and a more interesting story line.  Bottom line- forgive the pun- the characters are fantasy the sex is fantasy the ending is fantasy but fun to read.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|I really enjoy reading anything well written about history and lives lived in the time between the World Wars in Britain....this is it, letting us into the 'upstairs' 'downstairs' lives, customs, etc., of the folks living at that time in Essex...  Having traveled to that part of the country in the past, the well written passages brought back my time there back to life.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Was very interesting to think of how people would react to such a catastrophe as sun flares. A little violent for younger readers.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|A well written account of, not just the Bin Laden mission, but the every day life of America's most dedicated and deadly warriors. My congratulations on a great book, and my thanks to the wonderful men who make up the teams.
B00846REIS|4.0|I really liked Bared To You. It had a story that kept you reading. The only reason that it gets 4 stars instead of 5 from me is that it is slightly repetitive. He screws up, she runs away, they makeup. I do have good expectations for the upcoming book as Eva and Gideon seem to be working through their problems. I agree with other reviewers that I like it better than Fifty Shades!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|The entire family enjoyed the movie. The one's that is in their teens stop and watched the movie and like it also
0385742886|1.0|I was so excited to hear about the release of \\"The Kill Order.\\" Loved \\"The Maze Runner\\" trilogy and looked forward to the release of the prequel. However, after a great beginning to the book, and a great ending, there was so much dead space between that I had to force myself to keep reading.  Definitely not a page turner like the others.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Love all these books and this one doesn't disappoint. Couple of great twists and yet again couldn't put it down.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day measures a career, not a day.  It is a fast read, with the excitement of an action novel.  Washington political meddling is eye opening.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book as much as I loved 50 Shades! Not comparing the two because you just can't. They are two totally different books. If you loved 50 shades but didn't so much like to bdsm part of it you will LOVE this one! Can't wait for the others to be released!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This is a Michael Connelly book and as I expected, a very good read.  I am a big Harry Bosch fan and I was not one bit disappointed in this book.  I am looking forward to reading his next!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Loved the book, i read all three..... it was easy light and addictive reading, its a shame that the book is over.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I read the trilogy and this second book left me thinking the author could have left out most of the sexaul  content and still told her story.<br />I'm no prude but the sexual stuff became monotnous and boring. I ended up skimmimg through the sexual parts and getting back to the<br />main story line.  All the hype over this trilogy is Much ado about Nothing ,in my opinion.
B004IYHW1O|4.0|This turned out to be a surprisingly nice little film. Very French in its atmosphere. The story line was unique. The film was fun and entertaining. Highly recommended.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|this final book of the trilogy was better than the first two. I sipped throught the sexual activity just to get to the story line.<br />I did like the story line over all and felt the author could have  left a lot of it out because most of it was like a ritual I new what was coming (pardon the pun). I did like the ending.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book held my attention enough to order the next book in the series.  At some points I could not put it down.  Yes it is fancy, but good and well thought out.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|I didnt know these books existed until the HBO series was done.  I find myself sneaking off during work or staying up way to late to read.  The story has captured me and I dont want it to end.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Twice now I spent hours playing the game and twice all progress just. disappeared and forced me to start over.  Unfortunately Glue would not reimberse me for credits earned that were worth real money.  I recommend this game but do not recommend spending any money for upgrades.
B006CHML4I|2.0|I really wanted to like this watch. The style was perfect for what I was looking for, casual but not cheap-looking, but unfortunately the watch failed after a few months of daily use.<br /><br />The time was off just enough to be wrong- maybe 5 minutes by the end of a week or two (which when I read the reviews thought wouldn't matter, but what is the point of a watch if the time is wrong\\"?).<br /><br />It's possible being more careful with the watch would increase it's longevity, but I guess as a semi-active person it was too much for it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A Dance with Dragons just left me wanting more...as every other novel in the series has. The only problem this time is that I can't currently have any more, as the next book has not yet been published...

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I found all three books captivating and addicting...I didn't want to stop reading.  I tried to stop at the end of a chapter several times, but found the chapter left me hanging and I had to continue on.  I have read all three books twice now.  Once I understood what he was like I wanted to start over again to try to understand what was going on in his mind as I read from the beginning.  I hope there are another set of books that come out with his perspective.  I liked this book the best because I am a sucker for a happy ending.
B005ZOCFCW|4.0|I bought this book in part to make sure I had understood the movie version correctly.  Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is the story of the efforts of George Smiley, a British spy forced into retirement by the new guard, to determine whether a mole or double agent is behind the sequence of embarrassing failures the service has experienced in recent years.<br /><br />Le Carre is a master of the classic spy novel, but in this case, I think I found more nuance and character development in the movie than the novel. The novel has a lot of head hopping, and I didn't really care about the point of view of Bill the schoolboy.  On the other hand, reading about Smiley's little bits of spycraft was entertaining, as was the description of smiling becoming as obsessed and inward-turning as Control had been in his last days. Moreover, the view of the paralysis and distrust that pervades an entire organization when the presence of a mole is suspected was convincing and sadly relevant.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun fun fun. its a fun twist on the old game. the kids love it and so do I!!! great for all ages.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I found the final book in this trilogy very interesting. I liked the way the characters had developed from book one.  My level of interest remained the same throughout the three books and was pleased with the ending.  However the sexual content did not live up to all the hype.  Some historical romances I've read would leave it blowing in the wind.
0553805371|5.0|THE GRAND DESIGN<br />-Steven Howard Debrecki ©2012<br /><br />THIS IS THE third book I've read by Steven Hawking.  The other two being \\"A Brief History of Time\\" and \\"A Briefer History of Time.\\"  The third book, \\"The Grand Design\\" incorporates a lot of what is said in the other two, with one exception.  Mr. Hawking, using Einstein's General theory of relativity mixed with Quantum theory and other very complicated equations, like Newtonian theory, Feynman's sum over histories, has determined that \\". . . that the universes were created out of nothing.  Their creations does not require the intervention of some supernatural being or god. . .\\"  He even goes so far as to say there is no God and gives the Physics to prove it.  To get behind this you must know something about M-theory (The theory of everything) and something about a unified field theory, which Mr. Hawking has failed to prove.  A unified field in an interesting theory that I personally believe in.  In particle physics, an attempt to describe all fundamental forces and the relationships between elementary particles in terms of a single theoretical framework.  To dumb it down.  Are the same strong and weak nuclear forces (gravity) that hold sub-atomic particles together on a molecular and sub-molecular level the same forces that hold the planets, galaxies and universes together?  I believe that they are. In the book, \\"The Grand Design\\" Hawking points out a great many things one being \\"who is God's God?\\" an infinite loop question and that the universe has an infinite amount of possible histories such as, what if Hitler had won the war?  The greatest thing this book does is to is the \\"question of belief.\\"  Predestination verses free will.  According to Joseph Campbell (the brilliant road scholar on world religion) \\"It not what you believe, but that you believe.\\"<br /><br /> Hawking is using terms like \\"forces\\" to explain physics he forgets what is behind those \\"forces\\".  In Hawking's opinion it is nada, nothing, zilch.  The universe unfolded and created itself and all life known and unknown out of nothing.  A little tough to swallow, but it's is pundits and wags like this that make you ponder the question and that his greatest contribution.<br /><br /> Mr. Hawking has been confined to a wheel chair since his arrival at Cambridge where he shared the same seat as Issac Newton.  Due to Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis he wasn't suppose to live longer than two years.  He is now 70 and has been a twisted, contorted wreck, just a talking head, so to speak.  Now if you don't think God has a sense of humor just Google his picture.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I've found it a very interesting book, for people who have interest in sports, particularly in running.<br />I'm a modest recreational middle age runner, and now I have a clearer idea of why ultrarunners do what they do.<br />Jurek puts it as a human, sort of spiritual, search.<br />Also the discussion about eating is informative, ideas are clearly presented and make sense, with recipies scattered along the book.<br />And in a way is a good adventure book, as well.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I watched this with my three-year old grandson and we both loved it, The second time he watched it, he was already singing along. The animation was great, music great, message great. Any movie that keeps a three-year old mesmerized for the duration is worth having.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the written series and thought this movie did an excellent job of committing the story to film.  A movie can never replicate every detail of a book but this film did a good job of staying true to the spirit of the story.  I loved seeing our hero as the girl who was on fire, excellent job on the costumes and special effects.  I was also pleased that although the story necessarily involved the deaths of the other tributes the deaths as filmed did not subject the viewer to excessive gore.

B0027MJU00|5.0|I purchased \\"Dark Places\\" after reading Flynn's brilliantly written \\"Gone Girl\\".  This is an incredibly disturbing book that I couldn't stop reading.  I felt physically exhausted after reading it - but in a delicious way. The story is gruesome and sorrrowful but Flynn can write! Her characters will haunt you long after the book is finished. As a bonus, she has a wickly, wonderful wit that comes when you least expect it.  This book (or any of Flynn's books) is not for the squeemish. However, if you've been wanting a writer who doesn't waste a word - Gillian Flynn is your new favorite author.  What a writer! Never a dull sentence!
B003K15INU|4.0|American Pastoral was an American delight. While I am getting accustomed to sloshing around in my reading boots to Philip Roth's extravagant use of language, I I become enticed by the way he slices the \\"onion\\" of the character by peeling, slicing, chopping, reconstituting, mashing, and then doing it all over again and again.<br />It helps that I was born and brought up in a similar neighborhood in Boston and at a similar time period. t is easy to relate to his environment.  However, I think that if I were not Jewish I would be overwhelmed by his descriptive powers and extraordinary use of language.  Instead of my practice of skimming over pages to locate the plot lines, I luxuriated in the prose page after page. I read this novel after reading I Was A Communist and Nemesis. It may be easier to read Roth if you immerse yourself in his style.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good book page turner for sure.  This book keeps you on your toes. You just never know a person l never or do you l lol
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Fun, but not free.  You only receive half of the game for free which makes it Shareware and NOT Freeware.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|This version is very entertaining and hard to put down once you start reading. Very close to the movie but much greater detail.<br />Usually I have read the book before I see the movie, this time I did in reverse & was very surprised with the end result.<br />A very worthwhile read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've liked each of the 7 novels I've read by Nicholas Sparks.  He has a great gift. I will be reading other novels by him in the future.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The author sets out to convey to the world just how much work is involved in just getting to the point of being selected for a mission like this. Throughout the book teamwork, not individuality, is stressed over and over. The life of a Seal or any Special Force military man or for that matter CIA analysts is one of the toughest and unselfless paths of life. This is a well written telling of the mission to get OBL and the intelligence which would evolve from it. No one person should take any credit for the success of the mission except for being a member of the team and the author gets this point across like no one from the outside could ! I heartily recommend this read and commend the author for doing so.<br />After reading the news today that the author is being shunned by the Special Forces Community, I went back and reread parts of the book; I cannot speak for the Special Forces people because they are special but, seeing what a spectacle the politicians made of the raid, I can commiserate with Mr Owens and applaud him on the way he told his story.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Its a fun game many level of play<br />It  passes the time when sitting in waiting room<br />Only fall back is you can't. Change the way you shoot.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Delightful and challenging. This is not a series your five year old will enjoy since it can have some tough game strategies, but it is kind of cool to have something besides green pigs to fight with and freeing the birds from their cages is really satisfying!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This was an endearing film about a British attempt to improve relations in this Middle East country by bringing in a sport normally only possible in northern waters...salmon fishing.  I don't want to give away the story, but it includes humor and a somewhat surprise ending.  Some may say it was predictable, but you have to wonder, can salmon really survive in Yemen?  Watch this film for a light-hearted story.
B004CFAWK2|2.0|I was completely bored with this book.  I am reading Can't Wait to get to Heaven and I don't want to put the book down.  I really like Fannie Flagg's books but just couldn't get into Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe.  If I could return it I would.  Sorry
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Excellent and reads like a thriller.<br /><br />Gives clear background and mission execution details like no other book in this area.<br /><br />True warriors story.<br /><br />Proceeds go to vets and the fallen.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|i like this game cuz its fun to play over and over again :) good quality and bright colors :) I'm a fan!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love every inch of this book, get lost in it EVERY single time I read it. Unexpected but enthrawling till the very end.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it! Absolutely addictive. Works great on the Kindle Fire. Could not be happier. It's like home-ec for a new generation.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Love this game!!!  A great twist on Tetris!  Can't stop playing it!  Great game for mental aerobics!  Challenging, quick and fun.  Works great on the Kindle Fire.  Occasionally, slow to respond to finger tap; otherwise a-okay.  AWEsum is an awesome app.
B000X9Q8A4|4.0|No one can deny that the Beatles have been extremely influential in music, and in pop culture in general. While opinions on the movie may vary, the music produced for it is--for the most part--an undeniably beautiful and fun tribute. The gospel version of \\"Let It Be\\" is moving, and who doesn't love a little Eddie Izzard flare with \\"For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite.\\" The only song I wasn't overly impressed with was Bono's version of \\"I Am The Walrus\\".
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app. Can see exactly. how much time remaining in charge w/o having to exit to settings.  Runs great on the kindle fire. I highly. recommend this app.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|The Thirteenth tale is definitely worth the read.  It is a bit dark and depressing at times, but it keeps you captive. The twists and turns in the story are suprising and keep you guessing. I enjoyed how the characters in the story were unknowingly linked to each other.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|this is a very good book but its a copy of the book battle wich in the book 22 kids are gassed on a school bus and wake up on a remote island and instructed to kill each other for a military test only 1 person lives
B000QRIGLC|5.0|By far this  is the best book ever written.  I cried starting from the prologue and during the event.  This book deserves 10 stars.  I can see why it was on the beat sellers list.  Marcus Luttrel story is by far the saddest event I have ever witnessed or read about.  It is a true account of war and what is all about.  After reading this book I felt I was on mourning my self.  Change my perspective of Afghanistan.
B0087HT36U|5.0|great game better than other breakem games its like angry fowl into the screen with no velocity input required great game
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey has to be the most satisfying and high-quality series that we have ever enjoyed watching. The two seasons of Downton Abbey purchased on Amazon, truly fed the addict in me and each evening I would find myself saying, \\"just one more\\" and after watching that episode, again, it was \\"just one more\\".<br />The period covered by this marvellous series is a fascinating time in our history and the cast, the costumes and the settings were all simply superb.<br />I cannot wait for season three as this series is truly addictive.
B0090EKRKU|4.0|I wish that It had stayed closer to the book, even so, my kids enjoyed it! We will watch it again.
B002BWP4A6|4.0|One village, mysterious and barbaric acts in pre-WW! Germany. This black and white film is the German version of Picnic at Hanging Rock. A psychological thriller whose answers are left hanging in the mind of the viewer.<br /><br />My German mother had me late in life, my grandmother was a 16-year old in 1914, when this movie takes place. I have tons of photographs that look exactly like this film. I also know a ton of stories that echo what happens in the film. Ordinary brutality, both physical and psychological, was not that uncommon in the era, but the filmmakers have compressed many incidents into the course of one year in one small place. That's what gives the film its claustrophobic, paranoid edge and the allusion to atrocities and ultimately the Holocaust. It's a very flimsy link. All peoples are capable of atrocities given the circumstances. It's also worth noting that if the film had been shot in color, the dramatic impact would have been far less.<br /><br />The performances are controlled and understated,  heightening the tension. Nicely directed, reminiscent of Bergman's early works.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thought the book was well written. I couldn't put it down.It was interesting to find out how much miss information we get from the news media.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book was not turned into a glitzy thriller story by an over-eager editor.  This was written by a man who looks at his job as a profession - doing the work and learning/maintaining the skills needed to efficiently neutralize those who want to harm us and our country.  It shows dedication to competence, hard work, loyalty to his team and to his country.<br />  This man is not a glory seeker - he's simply outlining what a Navy Seal routinely does and what he himself has done.  It gives away no secrets. I'm proud of him and all the other Seals I've known and met during my 20-year career as a Navy Nurse and in the years since I retired. I'm grateful for the protection they give us and for their sacrifices.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|After I listened to the whole disc I had the idea to print the lyrics for all the songs. Then I read them in the order they appear on the disc. It's amazing how the story line comes alive. That's how operas are written. And this one would qualify to be labeled ART because it has a powerful message for our society and for our times and because it takes the musical shape, form and contrasting techniques of Queen and Scorpions to the next level, while incorporating elements of classical music, like an auditory collage. Wonderful work of art in my opinion!
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|My husband was familiar with the novel this came from and was anxious to see it.  We went to the theater and we all enjoyed it tremendously.  So much so that we bought it through Amazon.  I guess it wasn't a great hit at the box office, and that is a shame.  So many interesting characters, great graphics and the basic story line grabbed our attention.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|This is certainly not one of Lee Child's better books<br />I found it boring and, in fact, didn't even finish it<br />I have been a great fan of all the Jack Reacher books but unfortunately this one fell well short of being a good read
0307591549|5.0|This book contains simple tasks one can use to improve happiness.  Easy read and the ideas have been effective this far.  Recommended read!
B009AMAK0E|3.0|\\"Trouble with the Curve\\" is Clint Eastwood's first acting role since 2008's \\"Gran Torino.\\" Eastwood was talked out of acting retirement for this movie. The San Francisco born actor turned 82 this year and it seems as though \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" took advantage of his age. Eastwood plays Gus; a baseball scout who is too stubborn to retire or make time to deal with his health issues. While this is probably the best way to approach writing a character for someone of Eastwood's age, \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" often feels like surveillance footage of Clint Eastwood being ancient rather than being anything substantial. The health issues in the movie relate to his eyesight, so seeing him run into furniture or not being able to see a baseball player swing a bat are vital to that story point. So did we really need to see him have trouble urinating or curse at his bladder the entire time?<br /><br />The drama feels pretty unbearable until Gus's daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) enters the picture. Adams makes \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" worthwhile thanks to her strong on-screen presence. Her performance makes it seem like she really is Gus's daughter as she has stubbornness and is extremely tough, but at the same time she's extremely smart-witted and incredibly flawed thanks to how Gus always put baseball before his daughter.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Justin Timberlake isn't bad but doesn't really stand out either. Johnny Flanagan (Timberlake) was a pitcher who could once pitch a fastball at over 100mph, but eventually threw his arm out and is now a scout for the Braves just like Gus. His one-liners are often pretty humorous, but his performance overall seems to struggle to be as charming or even keep up with Adams' performance.<br /><br />The forced relationship between Gus and Mickey is the heart and soul of the movie. Not only is that a focal point of the story, but the chemistry between Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams is what keeps the movie from being a complete train wreck. Gus still grieves over the loss of his wife and feels like he did what was best for his daughter while Mickey feels as though Gus pushed her away to keep baseball the main priority in his life. Their arguments and their bonding moments are when \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" is at its best.<br /><br />The Gus character has the same problem that Hushpuppy's dad Wink did in \\"Beasts of the Southern Wild.\\" If the character wasn't so stubborn, his issues wouldn't be as inflated as they turn out to be. But at the same time, you wouldn't have the same journey laid out before you and the final product wouldn't be nearly as interesting.<br /><br />In what is quite possibly the best scene in \\"Trouble with the Curve,\\" a man hits on Mickey at a bar and grabs her arm and Gus ends up stepping in and threatening the guy with a broken beer bottle. As the confrontation escalates, Johnny steps in, makes a smart aleck comment and the guy eventually walks away. The scene combines humor, intensity, and drama into one sequence that lasts only a few moments, but its consequences are felt long after and when its finally revealed why Gus jumped in then it gains quite a bit of depth as well.<br /><br />The issue with \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" is that it's nothing special. While it certainly may contribute that the person writing this review isn't a fan of any sport, that doesn't always play a factor as \\"Moneyball\\" from last year was pretty good. If you can get past Eastwood whispering nearly every line, then he doesn't do too bad of a job here. Amy Adams is the only reason you should really go to see this though. She's really coming into her own as an actress and does an exceptional job here. \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" does take a while to get going, but thanks to the tainted father/daughter relationship at its core is much more sentimental than it lets on.grieves over the loss of his wife and feels like he did what was best for his daughter while Mickey feels as though Gus pushed her away to keep baseball the main priority in his life.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|As the author promised, this was an even-handed, non-partisan recounting of the UBL raid.  It recounts some of the human aspects (mistakes, emotional responses) of the raid that were not evident elsewhere. It is refreshing that the SEALs are not praised as heros on every page -- they are doing a job, and their superb, grueling training prepares them for it. Some readers may be put off by the coolness with which triggers are pulled that end human lives.<br />All in all, it is a very believable, well-written adventure story that just happens to be true.
B008220DGE|5.0|Even without being able to see the precision to detail of a 70mm print, the cinematography for \\"The Master\\" still leaves a massive impact. The overhead shots of Freddie (Joaquin Phoenix) sleeping on deck, soldiers slowly walking up a staircase, and those various shots of the clear, blue ocean are just magnificent. The pride and joy comes down to the close-ups during Freddie's conversations with Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman). You not only see Freddie's awkward facial expressions and his mannerisms, but you can almost feel his sickness. You can tell something isn't right with Freddie right from the start, but being that close is like an intimate encounter with him. It's as if you're witnessing a snake eat itself. Seeing Freddie unravel is the bread and butter of \\"The Master.\\"<br /><br />The score may divide its viewers, but it's still phenomenal. More often than not very little music is used during \\"informal processing\\" or the more heated exchanges and the lack of music lets their impact sink even deeper in your mind and your soul. When it is utilized, it's very 50s inspired. The film begins with a view of the ocean from the back of a boat with only a thunderous use of the score to welcome you. The rest of the score relies on strings, piano, and out of tune clarinets to enhance that uneasy feeling that Freddie always leaves you with. The bluesy undertones of the score fit the film like a glove.<br /><br />The performances are almost overpowering they are so incredible. This is the first film for Joaquin Phoenix after the faux documentary \\"I'm Still Here\\" and he's as impressive as ever. Freddie is so sex crazed and unpredictable that you can't help but be drawn to him. His alcoholism is out of control as he'll drink any booze within his vicinity in one gulp and his \\"potions\\" are practically the source of his undoing. The scene where Lancaster Dodd processes him for the first time is perhaps Phoenix's most powerful.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman is just as brilliant. He's so passionate about his work and his beliefs. His scene with John More (Christopher Evan Welch) where More calls Dodd out for his bizarre use of time travel that claims to cure forms of leukemia is extremely engrossing. And his heated exchange with Freddie in the jail cell is so well done and just amazing over all. Dodd is the only one who likes Freddie and wants to help him, but his desire to help Freddie is also causing Dodd and his family to deteriorate. It's a pretty intense downward spiral that is just spellbinding.<br /><br />Amy Adams seemed a little out of place. It's not that she did a bad job, but her performance doesn't seem to be on par with how strong she was in \\"Trouble with the Curve.\\" It's a character you're not used to seeing her portray and it never really feels like a proper fit, but at the same time it doesn't necessarily take away from the overall message of the film.<br /><br />\\"The Master\\" is not a film; it's a mesmerizing experience. Joaquin Phoenix reaches an entirely different level of greatness with his performance, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, and the score is downright incredible. Paul Thomas Anderson has ingeniously crafted a marvelous journey that you can't look away from.brilliant. He's so passionate about his work and his beliefs.

B00005JPSM|1.0|This is the first time I will write a BAD review on a movie I bought through Amazon.<br /><br />I could not really watch this movie because is skipped, got stuck and it was quite frustrating. I really wanted to add this movie to my collection as it is, in my opinion, a good movie. That was why I was just a bit upset.<br /><br />Sorry.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This app consumed me for a few days until I had worked through every level. Then I uninstalled it, simply to make app space on my Kindle Fire. Shortly after that, I missed the game and added it back so I could re-play the entire thing! There are several possibilities for passing the huge number of levels...but solving each obstacle using the least amount of weapons leads to GOLD rewards. Also, never ever kill any ladies while using your weapons.  :)
B005HHSXP0|5.0|I'm in love with this entire series, buy them all, read them all! Bursting for the next book to be released.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I purchased my cover as a \\"used\\" repackaged product. The item looked and felt new. It fit on the kindle easily and adequately. The issue stems from the setup that is designed to act as a stand. The groove on the back side is not sufficiently deep enough to hold the kindle up sturdily and securely. The slightest shift will cause it to loose it mooring and falling down. As a carrying case it is easy to open and close and does a good job of protecting the screen inside of a purse, briefcase, etc.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book did not disappoint!  This account tied together the information that has already been revealed about the raid by other sources.  It also provided some insight into the operations of a tier 1 asset. I understand the importance of operation security (opsec) and free speech and i'm not in a position to determine if this book crossed the line.  I felt it was a good read and well written compared to some of the other accounts written about the war on terror.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Because of this ap, I have fallen into the habit of listening to the Bible each night.  It is wonderful.  I can choose from several translations too.  Wonderful.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best books ever. The story of how this man became himself is<br />so interesting. The love he has for Ana is so real. He is so fifty shades of<br />complex.  Hard to put the book down once you get start reading it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob.<br />This book, essentially a court trial novel, is a gripping story of \\"did he or didn't he?\\" but told from both the court side - as well as the parents of the accused side. It is gripping (though slow in places) and, towards the end, has more twists and turns than Lombard street in San Francisco.<br />All the characters in the book are well drawn - one gets the feeling of personally knowing them. The end however is - I can't think of a correct word - stunning? unexpected? weird?<br />All in all - I greatly enjoyed reading it from start to its spectacular finish.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game is way better than the first one and the best part is the graphics these are the best I have seen in a while.  her this game
B000XUBC5E|5.0|This book was a great thriller with an edge of your seat kind of story.  There are so many twist and turns of suspense.  I have read other Harlan Coben and he never disappoints.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The movie was awesome but the very end was kind of crappy. it didnt really make sense...its like a cliff hanger.
B00846TRHY|4.0|Very good movie! I did not know it was based on a true story until the end!!  I would recomend this movie to anyone.
B007JRUA7K|4.0|Probably not as much historical truth here as I'd like to believe, but fun to pretend there is. Nice acting and a very interesting take on an interesting person for a week or so that happened during a dynamic time in my lifetime. Most likely not as interesting for those that were not alive and aware at that point in time.
B0090EIILU|4.0|So many, funny catch phrases... a must see... if you like outrageous humor and fairly offensive (its a comedy) subject manor
B002KEZ96Y|4.0|Another pretty entertaining film with no real substance. Great for the more thoughtful sheeple as there are no poop jokes, just a pee joke.
B00846REIS|2.0|This is a \\"wanna be\\" Fifty Shades of Gray. I wouldn't recommend it! The sex scenes are dull and the way they end up meeting doesn't make sense. The relationship happens to fast and too casually. I would stop reading it if I hadn't paid to download it!
B0083EW97W|3.0|Kind of an old feel with a hint of country...Not my favorite john mayer but it was an ok CD
B00338QENI|5.0|Wonderfully written book with such thought provoking material. Wasn't expecting it to be a page turner but it was. The science references were easy to understand and were balanced out with a story about a family trying to make sense if their world.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|It worked on my after market iPod interface that I installed on my 2007 Nissan frontier, but the product looks kind of cheap, very delicate. If you do not treat it with love I think it will fall apart.<br />Sometimes when I am using it, I could hear static.<br />Overall I love it because I was looking for a device like this.<br />Next time, I will probably go for a $11 dollar one not this $22 CableJive DockBoss
B0046B3QTG|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  It was really cute and a lot of fun.  I almost wish we had bought it instead of just rent it so we could watch it again later on down the road.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|An outstanding read. The writer keeps you totally involved through believable descriptions applied to gory, intense events that make today's news stories almost copies of the people, places, and events happening today
030758836X|4.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. It was so well written and suspenseful, you will find yourself wanting to finish it in one night. Well worth the read!

B0001AVZA8|5.0|Jack at his best. Maybe just a notch below As Good As It Gets (which is as good as it gets), but still pretty darn funny! Glad I bought it. It gets added to my growing collection of Jack Nicholson movies.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The author has created a unique vision of the future, where society is locked in a vast underground 'silo', waiting for a time when the destroyed surface world becomes habitable again. They have been there for generations and most knowledge of the past, and how they came to be there, has been lost... or so it seems. The story is very compelling and has some real surprises. I was unsure of how it was going to end until the very last page. The characters are well written and realistic. There is quite a bit of action, and a couple of times I worried that it might get to into eye-rolling territory, but it walked the line very well, and stayed exciting while still being believable.<br /><br />I gave this book 5 stars and I do not hand out 5 stars very often. The last book I gave 5 stars, I believe, was 'The Road'. This book is right up there, and had me pondering about where mankind is headed, in a similar manner.

Yes we know some things could be less likely in real-life. But it sure is<br />fun to dream that we could do just that if us humans needed too.<br /><br />And now having said that about the battleship game we'll await for that movie<br />to come next.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009329ZF2 Battleship]]
B002CIY8EM|5.0|Loved the book. I always knew there was a better more technological answer than the selected stories in the Bible. Constantine was first & foremost a politician & that is why he incorporated pagan Jewish & Christianity in the Bible with only selected stories. Great read.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|The DP from Cloverfield should watch this film.  This is how you do a \\"found footage\\" movie.  The storyline is excellent and the execution was flawless.
B007N8RULO|4.0|as I said fun game a little bug black out thing ads a pain but I can get over it
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Started with the show. Became addicted from there. So I decided to start to read the source of this fabulous story. I got my Galaxy tab and wanted to try out some eBooks and this was the perfect book to start with. Not only do the graphics pop on your tablet it creates a different kind of experience to enjoy reading. Highly recommend to anyone!
B000FCK42M|4.0|Informative and exciting couldn't,t put it down. Don Winslow is a wonderful writer who captures your interest in the first paragraph.<br />The Power of The Dog is a must read for those who want to gain insight of the war on drugs , gun running and illegal immigration.
B0086700CM|5.0|So Much Fun! Highly Addictive! Once you start playing you do not want to stop. Hours of Fun!<br />Don't start until your homework is done!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book literally took my breath away. I found myself yelling at the characters at times. It was a frustrating book in the way that slavery is s frustrating part of our past. Highly recommend
B008D28HYS|5.0|Lots of fun. Great time waster and tons of levels. More words to fill this review. Words words words words.
B0091XRL86|5.0|This is an adorable movie for the whole family.  Nick Parks has hit yet another home run with this inevitable classic!  The humor of the characters is not to be missed - you'll want to watch it several times to see what you might have missed along the way!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Was a little surprised that I couldn't put it down, and went on to read the next two right away. Wish there were dozens more in the series.
B00571F26Y|4.0|While I had little idea that Wheat was in the \\"Everythings Bad for You\\" column, this book put forward the science about why that is the case. Largely that what we call \\"wheat\\" these days is very far genetically than it was centuries ago.  A slice of whole wheat bread produces more blood sugar that sugar.  Everyone needs to know this.  I was crushed that my favorite whole wheat bread is bad for me. However, I bought Non Gluten waffle mix and that was a delicious breakfast this morning.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have gotten quite addicted to Pinterest,  and it works on my Kindle Fire MOST of the time. However I also experience the problems with it not being able to log in and I have to &quot;force close &quot; a lot. I also have a problem with it freezing up on me while in use and I have to shut down the Kindle to get it to do anything.  This would be a great app if the bugs got worked out.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Not bad but thought there would be more details about the mission and what they did with osama body and maybe some pictures
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn was a quick read, but that was because of the twists in the story that made me want to keep reading! The first third of the book had me hooked, the second third shocked me and the last third left me speechlees.  Great book for interesting book club chats that for sure!!
B005AKFXZW|3.0|The way Morgenstern presents magic in believable prose is one of the successful markers of this book. She manages to capture each illusion or sleight of hand in a way that is both enthralling and convincing, and the mystical atmosphere of the black and white setting of the circus is very consistently presented, so that the reader feels drawn to it as something tangible. I found myself marvelling at the intricacies of the ornate clock at the entrance of the circus, complete with jugglers and subtle change of scenes with each passing moment - the details that the author draws the reader's attention to are good examples of Morgenstern's prowess at conjuring vivid pictures with her words, the mark of an ingenious prose magician.<br /><br />The love story at the heart of the strange competition that sets the circus in motion is however, for me, less captivating. Perhaps there is the sense of the usual forbidden love between lovers of opposing camps that seems unusually dull. The saving grace is the story of the twins who are born with the inauguration of the circus and their friendship with an ordinary boy Bailey, who would prove to play an important role to the fate of the circus, that gains reputation as more than just a performance venue.<br /><br />An entertaining read.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom is an amazing writer and this book is no exception. From the very first page it kept my attention.<br />I love the way he writes...like truth in a fiction form. I look forward to every new book he writes and The Time Keeper was worth the wait.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Love this movie. There is nothing better that a classic Christmas movie anytime of the year. Will watch over and over.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Again, i'm a huge incubus fan and to me, all the cd's i own could've been left on shelves since this album is so AWESOME! no song is worth skipping on this masterpiece and when i was 14, this cd almost got worn out. morning view will never get old.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Great read! Couldn't seem to put it down. Exciting, fast paced, intrigue. This is one of Baldaccis best. My favorite so far of his is still \\"The Winner\\" but this one was extraordinary!<br />[[ASIN:B006VFLIYK The Innocent]]
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Well written and informative. I found his obvious dislike for President Obama spoilt the book for me as it was not the right forum. The book was 99% about his military service and I was not interested in who he voted for.
B00846TRHY|5.0|This may not be your usual Gerard Butler movie, but he was awesome in it and it was a powerful & moving story. This was about a REAL life & it's redemption.... Maybe little slow to start for some, but sucks you right in... And for a previous reviewer> in 'real life' people act and handle things a lot differently than how we think they should or how they do in perfectly flowing 'story lines' in the movies that are based on fiction that we are used to watching.. Real life does not always flow perfectly like in the 'fictitious' stories in the movies.. In real life there are 'highs' so high & 'lows' so low and how anyone deals with a certain situation may not be how the next person does... Although in this case, I would do EXACTLY like the PREACHER! This movie was Fabulous! Watch through the credits at the end for 'real life pictures' of the preacher and others in this story. I loved it and recommended it to others that loved it also... This movie stayed with me long after it was over...It haunted me...Thank you Preacher for all you do & GOD BLESS YOU for never giving up on the good fight!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was well written.  I loved the chemistry between the main characters.  There were some far-fetched pieces to the story, but - hey - we're reading fiction!  I would recommend this book.
030758836X|5.0|Full of twists and turns, Gone Girl unfolds like a classic Hitchcock thriller, shocking you with every turn of the page.  It is a gripping masterpiece, superbly written with layers of intrigue and mystery, making it one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever read.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great book, Gillian Flynn has more than delivered!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I really wanted to follow the storyline, but found that it is just the same old same old.  I did not purchase the 3rd book, because it's just not that good for the price.....
B00932ANQM|2.0|Was not all that impressed. However, i do not believe i fall into the target market with this movie. 36 yr old male. Women ages 16-40 may enjoy this movie.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Contrary to other peoples' reviews I found this book very read-able and enjoyable.  While not as thrilling and page-turning as the first 3, A Feast for Crows still has a great story line and it keeps me reading.  I would recommend this book to those who enjoy the series.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|My husband and I are avid fans of Lee Child; we have read EVERY BOOK!  We are anxiously awaiting the next one!!
B00846REIS|4.0|I am very new at reading these type of books! I can say as a single woman it really made me wish I was not. The passion and dynamics to me were better than Shades of Grey. I am waiting for the 2nd book! Pre-ordered and waiting!
B00932A2MC|4.0|This movie so much fun I watched it twice. Not great on facts, or possibilities but lots of fun if you like sci-fi.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the first book in the series and dived right into Book 2 - Catching Fire.  The sequel did not disappoint!  The story of Katniss Everdeen and her struggles against the Capitol are so imaginative and suspenseful - I would definitely recommend it, but only after you've read Book 1: The Hunger Games.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|While a bit pricier than I remember previous books being, I still feel that this was worth it. Not brilliantly better than Kathy's other books, it was on par. This one takes place in rural Canada, a bit different local, and I have to admit that the ending was not expected. Overall, I was pleased with the plot but I felt that the relationship between Temperance and her \\"men\\" was a bit unbelievable -- and their arguments unprofessional.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Have not enjoyed a King book so much since 'THe Stand.' I found this book to be courageous and inspiring..
B008M34IJG|4.0|This made for a great \\"man night\\" to just chill and watch some actiony/sci-fi type movies. It had some cheasy parts in it, but overall, still a great movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I often read this type of book because I admire our armed forces, particularly the spec ops teams. This story is engaging, timely, and well written. Divulging secrets?? Huh?? You'll learn more from Clancy, Flynn, Thor etc. than you'll get from this book.
B000W93CHC|4.0|While \\" World without End\\" was very good, it was nowhere near as good as the first book.  I was disappointed.
B0050XFY4O|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, but this film was worth the viewing.  Told sensitively, not salacious at all.  Worth viewing.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Full of twists and turns. It keeps you guessing until the end. It has good character development, a trait often lacking in this genre.
B0027MJU00|2.0|Dark Place was filled with characters I have never known, would not like to know and totally did not understand as far as their actions and motivations were concerned. I loved Gone Girl and wanted to read Flynn's other works but after Dark Places I am reluctant to read Sharp Objects. The primary protaganist (I have even forgotten her name as she was so unsympathetic) was an unpleasant person who had lived an awful life but could not do anything for herself to change it and I could not even root for her.  I guess she ultimately was as happy as she could ever be but, compared to what most of us expect out of life, it would not be what I could call satisfactory.  After finishing this book I just wanted to put the whole thing out of my mind.
B00932A6G4|1.0|did not relize this movie was animated did not finish movie previews look like regular movie my mistake i have they other regular movies
B0012268N8|4.0|This is a great collection of hits from Steve Stills. My favorite is Johny's Garden. All of the CSN guys did solo albums but I think this was the best.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I was blown away by Gone Girl but sorry to say sharp objects is not of the same caliber. I was looking forward to another great read, but must say I was disappointed.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I'll admit, I was a little skeptical about reading a book about witches and vampires, but by the third chapter I was completely enthralled with the story. The characters are beautifully written and I felt like I really got to know them.<br />The concepts that Deborah uses are fantastic. I was constantly curious as to what was going to happen next. What would the next twist be, or how would Diana further progress in her travels of not only finding Ashmole 782 but herself as well.<br />The second book to this trilogy is just a good, if not better! The only thing that I am disappointed about it that I have to wait for the final book to come out!<br />It is definitely a must read if you are a fan of Harry Potter or the Outlander series! A perfect combination of the two with just as many twists and turns that will leave you dying to find out what happens next!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Sherlock Holmes has so much suspense! Its a wonderful action movie. This movie will have you on the end of your seat the entire time. Robert Downey Jr.makes the movie very spectacular.
B008LY9AWG|1.0|Not one of his better books.  Short stories with no ending. His other books are awesome. I was very disappointed in this one after reading all his others
B000GOU4M4|5.0|Christmas Vacation is the funniest Christmas movie I've ever seen. I have probably watched this movie 50 times through the years, and I laugh myself silly every time. We use the tag lines quite often in our home when we just want to crack each other up. \\"If you need me, I'll be upstairs alseep.\\" \\"Holy ***t, where's the Tylenol.\\" \\"Don't throw me down, Clark.\\" \\"Tis the season to be Merry.\\" Classic comedy!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This was an very good mystery. The characters and plot twists kept me guessing until the very end. Once I thought I knew who was the killer but I couldn't have been more wrong. That's okay tho'- makes for an interesting read!!!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This is a marvelous continuation of Martin's Throne Game series. The complex and engaging story line features interwoven tales of intrigue, lust for power, political dynamics and ambition.  The characters are rich and wonderfully constructed.  I am reminded of Tolkein but perhaps that is unfair to both Martin and Tolkein.  I'm thoroughly enjoying the literary journey.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great app!  I turn on relax melodies at night to help my children relax and eventually go to sleep. Relaxed children= Relaxed mom
B008LY5VHE|5.0|A great summertime movie.  The final shark scene is the best!  Quality of the movie was clear without any interruptions.  Quick and easy on the kindle or computer.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I'll start with the negative: One would think that after 18 years in captivity, this book would be much longer. I was left wanting to know more about her day to day adult life in captivity. I wanted a contemplation of her and her daughter's relationship.<br />  The positive: Yes, some of it is written as though a child would have written. That is because she spent some of her childhood there and was left with a childlike perception of her life and experiences there.<br />  People keep asking, \\"Why didn't she run when she had the chance?\\" Read it through and through and try to put yourself in her situation. It's an amazing, sad, horrible, inspiring, unbelievable story about confinement, manipulation and survival.
B008602KQI|5.0|Quality of the movie was good.  No interruptions during the movie.  Easy to download.  Enjoy watching on my kindle fire or computer
B005EGXTL2|5.0|The Mockingjay adds another dimension to the Hunger games trilogy. Well written with a questioning twist keeps you hooked. I really wish there was fourth book!
B000FC12ZA|2.0|If you are looking for insight into the world view of aboriginal people this is not the book to read.<br />If you are looking for a poorly written but enjoyable light fantasy this is your slice of pie.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this game. It is not that exciting but it is challenging. It is harder to do on my phone so having a tablet would best suite this app but I manage pretty well right now.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I was skeptical after reading the mixed reviews, but this book does a great job of continuing the plight of the characters and the Seven Kingdoms following the years of devastating wars. It takes more than one book to catch up with everyone (Book 5) but I'm looking forward to continuing the saga. I'm half way through Book 5 now and enjoying it tremendously. This is definitely character development and not high action, but after all the happened in Book 3, we need a little break from action to catch our breath, get our bearings and prepare for the future.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book certainly reviews the intensive and consistant training that Seal members must go through.. It descibes the intense planning and training required for each mission, and they work together almost as one entity to accomplish their missions.  They almost think with the same mind.  Very well written.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Love, love the new album! I love how it sounds and the songs are so much fun. It rocks!! You won't be disappointed!!
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I am a Sparks fan but this book was not his best. It was exciting in some parts but overall I found it slow and a tad boring.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Great movie - my 2 year old simply loves Cars and this movie sends a good message about friendship. My daughter also enjoys this movie. It is a hit for all ages!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I thought this was a good \\"second\\" to the trilogy, especially because it leaves the reader with a mystery at the end that can only be concluded in the third book. However, I really got bored with all the sex scenes in this one.  Good grief!  They were doing it so many times a day that it became not believeable.  I got to the point where I skipped some of it because it was just too much.  I still gave it a four though because it has a story behind it and I liked the way it leads into the last book.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|This is a fun little game, after I figured out how to play it. It is kind of like a risk-type of game with some different rules. It was fun for a little while, and I still have the game installed on my tablet 1 month after I installed it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Nothing but the best is what you expect from Doris Kearns Goodwin and that is exactly what you get in this book.  Not only is this an excellent choice but it is a MUST READ!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was not what I expected at first, but still an excellent book.  Very big twist at the end.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Kindle is great for instant down loads of latest books.<br /><br />\\" No Easy Day \\" is hard to put down due the number of true and different action stories.
B00846REIS|3.0|Definately not as good as \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" but it was ok.  I hope her next book will be better.  It lacked the action outside of the bedroom that it's competition had, wasn't captivating.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Movie was good. I liked it. But it was not up to mark as hyped when released. It could be much better.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This series is excellent. I LOVE reading and I'm just getting back into it now that my kids are grown, but I'm really having a hard time finding books of real quality that I can 'get lost in'. They don't write books with the same qualities and standards that they used to. \\"Writers\\" today who consider themselves \\"authors\\" write science fiction/fantasy books and label them as Y.A. which seems to allow them to 'write' books without the same good quality and standards of a book where they create a world and characters with substance, that are believable, with any complexity or depth, or even good grammar in many cases.<br />These books are as good and of the same quality as J.R.R. Tolkien's: Lord of the Rings series, at the least.  I am enjoying this series immensely and will return to them later to enjoy them again.
B000FCK65W|4.0|I read Betty Smith's book shortly after it was first published.  As a young girl, I loved it.  Oh these many years later it was a nostalgic read, and I enjoyed revisiting the world.
B0088WFZQG|4.0|My wife and I both enjoyed this movie... I think we saw some similarities from the acting point of view to lower budget films, but that didn't bother either one of us.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The first of the book was a bit slow reading, but it was necessary to set up the training these Seals go through.  I thought it very interestiing to know that they had training where they simulated these attacks.  The most fascinating was the attack itself, especially the emotions this man experienced but was able to put aside to perform his duties.  I would recommend it.
B00846REIS|5.0|Absolutely risque and scandalous, I re-read many paragraphs several times because they were intense and very moving. You will love and hate Mr. Steele.  I asked my husband to read several paragraphs to see what he would say.
B0086DBE62|3.0|This movie was such a cute and funny movie. A great Family movie we really enjoyed watching it. I love Julia Roberts in any movie!
B007SGM084|4.0|I read through all the three books, in the beginning at the strong suggestion of my wife, to be honest.  However, I found it entertaining, but, after a while, became quite amused and curious about the \\"Ana\\" character.... Asking some female friends around, I was told that in effect, women tend to reason as \\"Ana\\".... - very surprising, as I found the character, after a while, \\"annoying and twisted....,\\" which the women I talked to, about the book, are certainly not.<br /><br />As for the eroticism, I found it mildly OK, but nothing you do not find easy enough in internet - it seems women tend to find it more entertaining reading than looking at it.  I suppose that the fact that the book is written in first person, also helps.... - I can recommend it, for it really can open men´s mind about how women may think, and just for fun....
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I'm totally addicted to this game.  What fun!  :) Easy to learn as you go.  Save up those points for more colors and you can't go wrong.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was a wonderful ending to The Hunger Games Trilogy. I felt pulled into the lives of each character and found myself rooting for Katniss at every experience. The author did a great job of showing intimacy between Katniss and Peeta without making it unreadable for the younger crowd. [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]][[ASIN:B003XF1XOQ Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great read! There were was a couple pages that became boring buy thats when an action came to save the day. Worth purchasing!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is really good.  I love the colors and the way your finger makes a trail.  It starts very easy and then gets more challenging.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to think outside the box - in a box.
B0091W4IRY|5.0|Great movie...just as good if not better than the first!!! Ive watched this movie 20 times already, and plan to watch it many more!!!
B0084I9QIW|5.0|This is Michael Jackson at a true performance peak in full command of his craft, pure and simple. The talent level and energy on display by Michael here is astounding and mesmerizing. Like many other longtime fans i'd been waiting decades for an official video release from this tour and this DVD has exceeded my expectations tenfold. Sure, the 1980s 4:3 videotape quality is marginal, and even the 5.1 audio isn't all that spectacular but who really cares when the content is this good? In terms of official video releases, this blows away anything else you've ever seen. If your only real exposure has been the Dangerous DVD, youtube vidoes, or This Is It -- just wait until you see this one. Throw it in the DVD player for your skeptical friends and relatives and watch their jaws drop, yes it's that good. There is no hype here folks, this is the real deal and absolutely essential for any serious Michael Jackson fan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the perfect follow up book for the original \\"Hunger Games\\".  It flawlessly flows as if it were just the next chapter and not another book.  Excellent!
B00002EPJH|5.0|This solo album done when Jarrett was dealing with chronic fatique syndrome is precious.  Simply put, there are very few people who can get as much feeling out of the piano as this guy.  He's a giant.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Good to read and edit short Word documents and Excel spreadsheets. OK to view powerpoint documents but very difficult to edit.
B005LAIH9A|1.0|The american reunion dvd that i bought was suppose the be unrated. The one i got is a rental dvd and it wont let me play the unrated vertion. i'm not very happy about that.
B003YNXTUI|5.0|I love this Offspring album. I have purchased countless times. Always seem to disappear. Now I have on the cloud and can listen anywhere.
B00005MEW1|5.0|I feel like people are writing this review as if the \\"Gothic Industrial Mix\\" was meant to replace the original music accompaniment.<br /><br />It's fine if you don't like it; but the point is to watch this movie to whatever suits your fancy. For me, this music created a scary realm, at times trance-like, but genuinely spooky. I appreciate the old tracks, but sometimes it's hard for me to un-hear the old timey music and slip into a horror. This mix does that for me.<br /><br />It may not jolt you like heavy metal might, or make you jump, but it hijacks your mind and forces you to get inside this world. With the old film--the jump cuts, the lighting, the frame rate--it is truly creepy.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I watch movies to escape the everyday and have some fun, this movie met all the criteria for money well spent. I thought the story was solid and moved along at a good pace, the production value was, in my opinion , excellent. If you're on the fence and you're an sci-fi action fan then go ahead and pull the trigger. You won't be disappointed.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I really love Kathy Reichs books. They have had it all, the science, the mystery and a little bit of a love ( or lust story) This one was special because a lot of it takes place in my home province of Alberta. The subject is very relevant , the missing ( presumed murdered) sex workers of Edmonton.  A good read.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book started off promising. The introduction of the characters was strong but as the story progressed it went down hill.  I found the story to be a \\"want to be\\" knock off of twilight. I guess with all the sex it was the mature audience version of just that without vampires.  Things were repeated way too often for my taste. Those eyes, those lips, those hips, them jeans, his eyes, her eyes...just on and on and on. Very disappointed that I actually purchased this book. Could have borrowed the book and been just as disappointed but with $10 still in my account.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|A great read from start to finish! Even if you never lived through them you will feel a nostalgia for the Fifties and Sixties.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|AWEsum! is the right name for this App.  Like Tetris with Number blocks.  Has several features to Swap, Rotate, Slide Blocks sideways, etc.  This gives you lots of variety to help play and adds to your Enjoyment.  It is very Colorful, works very Smoothly and has Nice Music and Cute Sound Effects.  The game play is easy, Challenging Fun and Engaging.  Great game to keep your Mind Sharp.  It has NO Objectionable AD-ONs, In-App Purchasing or other annoyances.  Works AWSOME on my Xoom Tablet.  Developer (NOMAD Apps) has made a Quality app with no Greedy or Questionable annoyances to spoil our fun.  GREAT WORK-THANK YOU!
B0093KS6K4|5.0|There are so many twists and turns with this story.  Just when you think you have it figured out something else happens and changes your mind.  I like that it has more of a plot than four high school girls that sleep around.  Even though they suggest some sexual content it has been very minimal so it has been fairly safe for my older children to watch.
B007SSEU9O|4.0|I selected this video because Meryl Streep always gives an excellent performance. The reviews I read were not great, but I decided to give it a chance because I didn't know much about Thatcher beyond her being pals with Ronald Reagan.<br /><br />I thought the cast did a great job of portraying people over time, and the script conveyed the arc of human accomplishment and then deterioration. I don't know too much about Britain's political system, but this gave me just enough to get an understanding of it. Margaret Thatcher's prominent rise through the political ranks to the top job was well documented (or documented enough for me). Her achievement as a woman in the middle of the old boy network is certainly something that hasn't been done in the U.S. - yet - and that in itself is remarkable.<br /><br />I thought it was well worth seeing and, of course, Streep killed.
B009329Y30|4.0|I loved this movie simply for the chance to see Zac Efron. The young man has become quite the handsome hero type. The story of him, by chance, finding an unknown woman's picture on the battleground in Afgan is enough to draw the watcher in, but to watch him track down this woman, then fall in love with her is a sweet, typical, and predictable romance that captures the heart. You'll root for him all the way because...well...because he's the good guy. So if you like a lighthearted, sweet romance that leaves you with a warm feeling and a smile, then The Lucky One is for you. I highly suggest you watch it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't be fooled like I was. I kept thinking it's going to get better because everyone was raving about the series. It never did. I was so disappointed with the series and I'm an avid reader of all types of books. Don't waste your time or money. Truly disappointing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book. Thank You to all service men and women. You set a great example of unity and team work in the name of freedom. I loved the style of writing. Pooh Pooh on the government, Mark did not give any secrets away. Maybe somebody with \\"intelligence\\" should read the book first before passing judgement. Keep up the great work you do Mark and to all SEALS I salute you.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Don't be fooled like I was. I kept thinking it's got to get better because everyone was raving about the series. It never did. I was so disappointed with the series and I'm an avid reader of all types of books. Don't waste your time or money. Truly disappointing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a good annoying. Keeps you trying harder levels.<br />Grandkids love it too. Just when you think you have all<br />the colors right, you end up crossing a color. The levels<br />get harder each time. We have a lot of fun using it
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Don't be fooled like I was. I kept thinking it's got to get better because everyone was raving about the series. It never did. I was so disappointed with the series and I'm an avid reader of all types of books. Don't waste your time or money. Truly disappointing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love all three books!  I don't want it to end!  I know I will re-read this series over and over.  Can't wait for more books written by E.L James! I am a huge fan!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I believe this to be an honest factual account of the<br />daily life of a Navy Seal who through hard work and a<br />little luck got picked for maybe the mission of the Decade.<br /> Refreshing to read minus all the political B***-S***.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put down, had to keep reading.  Love the writing and the humor and the love they share for each other.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its like the best game ive ever played but it does get boring when you cant beat a level &iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found this to be an important account of the action taken to arrest or kill Bin Laden. I was particularly interested in having the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle supplied as to the intelligence aspects of the situation and the actual order of events in the raid of the compound. My hat is certainly off to all the intelligence people involved, particularly the woman whose certainty that Osama was there was borne out, and to the Seals whose immediate improvisational actions saved the mission. I do hope that the author is correct in stating that nothing has been revealed that would compromise our intelligence gathering or the safety of any of our people. So much had already been leaked by the Administration, however, that it is hard to see how this book would be actually harmful.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a very good simple calculator and it comes in handy when you need to do some quick calculation that I can't seem to do in my head anymore.
B004P12SSW|5.0|Love this movie!!!!Cher and Christina sure can sing, and it has a great story to it. I bought it so I can watch it whenever I want.
B0088RQ4TI|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Sooooo bad! The acting is awful, the premis is rediculus and the special effects are really poorly done. I have no idea why people are giving it five stars. It sounds like they really liked the books that it was based on. Well, having not read the books I can say that from a purely cinematic perspective John Carter is a total flop.
B008XG1X18|5.0|the pinterest app is so easy to use, I absolutely love it!  I use it on my kindle fire, and I actually prefer it over the computer. when I'm on pinterest,  I'm on the app.
B003SJ4NRG|5.0|My family LOVES this movie! It's a classic kids movie, plenty of laughs from everyone of all ages! The animals are hilarious and so cute.
B002WBZD02|5.0|Really good cast.  Great story.  Almost any movie based on an Eelmo Lenard book has got to be good.  The movie is full of humor.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story got my interest up right away and swayed me to one side and then the other all the way through.  The story kept me wondering up to the last page how it would turn out.  Great descriptive language.  I'll read her other books after this one!
B0089LIY7I|5.0|This is a great live album! It is mostly songs from last 2 albums but it would complement older live albums which have the older songs .
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|When we watch Downton Abbey: Season 2, it is a family time.  We only watch one episode at a time, and are happy to have discovered the possibility of having subtitles on the screen.<br />We don't want to miss a single line, which is sometimes difficult with the British accent.<br /><br />We can hardly wait each week for the next \\"watching\\" and are really involved with all of the family characters as well as the servants.<br /><br />Thank you for a top-rate DVD!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was, by far, better than the first two in the series.  The plot was much better.  The characters were better developed.  It was much more realistic.  In fact, the more I read, the more I wanted to read.  Really enjoyed this one.
B009AMABH6|5.0|I won't try and explain this movie to you, because I think it's impossible to do. There are many, many interpretations of what goes on and I believe that you have to see it for yourself to determine what it means to you. That being said, I had great conversation afterwards trying to decide just what I thought it portrayed, and I came up with several. I will finally just say that this is definitely one that I will purchase so that I can watch and re-watch it. And I'm sure that every time I see it I will come up with something different. THAT's what makes this a great movie to me! The acting, especially by Robert Pattinson, was absolutely phenomenal. The ensemble actors were all wonderful though and each brought something very different to the movie. I can't wait until this becomes available - I will be first on the list and suggest that you get on that list as well!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest.  So many things to do with such specific interests.  Wish it had been around longer than it has.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Relatively little of the book is devoted to the Bin Laden raid. Most of it is fairly boring detail about the author's life and some unremarkable obrservations about SEAL training. I can see why the government didn't attempt to stop the publication.
B008Y212PI|4.0|like the title says this game is pleasant and very simple. once you learn the trick of where must a tile be and where it cannot be then its just a matter of following the puzzle to its logical conclusion.  nice diversion.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have a background in psychology.  This book was nothing more than graphic descriptions of sexual intercourse featuring a gentleman who was, indeed, a sex addict.  The \\"dungeon\\" described was a little over the top (although many exist around the country), but the so-called \\"rough sex\\" is an activity often practiced by consenting adults.  No big deal.<br /><br />Containing too many cute emails, the book was boring and did not serve any intellectual purpose whatsoever.
B00124HR22|5.0|\\"Killer\\" is still my favorite Alice Cooper album. \\"Desperado\\" is a haunting ballad of the Old West. \\"Dead Babies\\" was a subject before it's time. The height of Alice's long career.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Fun and addictive.  Love Angry Birds! Keeps you busy and doesn't lag. The game is hard enough to keep you hooked yet not too hard where you give up.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|We first had the Free version and it was hard because sometimes my kids would hit the Ad Banner while playing and get pulled out of the game.<br />As any parent knows, giving a kid a video game is usually done to keep a child entertained and Ad Banners ruin that when they get pulled out of their game.<br />Love the Ad Free version.  If I was without children I would be fine with with the Ads.
B000V6ACKG|5.0|One of the best from that era.  The Boys are Back in Town, Jailbreak, and The Cowboy Song all in one place.  Running Back and Romeo and the Lonely Girl are two songs you'll never hear on the radio, but they're keepers as well.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I was amazed at what this poor girl went through.  Even more amazing was seeing the person she became. I couldn't put the book down.  It was like reading a thriller when you have to keep reading because you want to know what happened next.
1400052173|5.0|This book was easy to read and understand.  I had never heard about HeLa cells before but when I stumbled upon this book, I was suprised that I never heard about her in any of my biology classes in high school or college.  It's a shame.  I'm glad her story is out and some recognition has been given to her.<br />My favorite aspect of this book is that it explains the science in a relatable manner to the average reader that may not have had a basic biology course in high school.  I think it also gives enough key words so that readers that want to know more can easily do more research.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app soconvient and easy to use! you should try it has lots of great options and add ons
B003MAOTP2|5.0|Excellent choice. I Absolutely recommend this movie. It is long but completely worth every minute. I will watch it again and again.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This was a good read and quick.  Not much in way of testing the brain but were these books written to do that?  It was a nice break from the first one and I am looking forward to reading the last one to tie it all up.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely the best of the three books.  You really see the transformation of Mr. Grey and see how troubled his past was, yet how wonderful his life can be when he works through the past to the future.  How could this trilogy be the authors first books???  Wonderfully written - love the vocabulary.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Great game! Very well designed. Excellent game play....very engaging! Got for free but would purchase. Great and numerous board designs.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Finally a calculator app that works like a calculator. I love the fact you can actually see what you've entered instead of just hoping you got it right.  And the percentage can actually be subtracted or added after its calculated, imagine that!
B003B02O14|5.0|This book was great from start to finish. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time and Lanigan is always manipulating everyone. Read this in two days and wanted more..
B001D09OAI|5.0|I love this movie.  The characters are so interesting and funny and are very well acted. The humor is great and at time very subtle.  I'm sure this is one of those movies I'll watch multiple times, and each time will find some humor I hadn't noticed before.
B008ETOSYI|1.0|I did not want the movie in this format. When I realized I made a mistake  I could not change my order. I have never watched the movie. Not only did I waste money on this purchase. I never saw the movie I was looking forward to.
0345525558|3.0|Sad,moving and educational. The knowledge about flowers was very interesting. The story was to sad for my liking.<br />My book club members were an even split. Three liked it and three didn't.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|An outanding book written so a person of a limited psychology knowledge could understand.  I am a stroke victim and \\"happiness\\" is a key to any recovery.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|this is the best kitty movie ever!!!! luv thomas o'mally the alley cat, and the drunk goose how can u beat a drunk goose. this is great fun for the whole family.
B008A1NSTG|3.0|My eight-year-old granddaughter, my daughter and I watched this movie together.  My daughter and I didn't remember this story, so it was surprising to us it was based on fact.  Some of the acting was rather hokey, we did not like some of the language used as it was supposed to be a family film, but it was an interesting movie.
B0081L37Z0|3.0|This comedy was just ok. It's pretty much your standard issue slap stick comedy. I would probably recommend it others I think may like it..
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This reads like a teenage fantasy, which is fine if you want a mindless escape from reality and indulge in a some mildly satisfying sexual self gratification.<br />However, if you want to read something that provokes thought and stimulates your mind more than to ask WHY? OH WHY? does the main character keep repeating things like ... \\"my inner goddess is hugging herself with glee...\\" and \\"My inner goddess pouts provocatively at me.\\"??? Then, this is not the book you want to delve into. In fact, her \\"inner goddess\\" is referred to at least 42 times. REPETITIVE is the key word for all aspects of this book.  Yes, even the sex scenes become repetitively boring.<br />The writing is juvenile at best and I had to stop reading less than halfway through this book to retain my self respect.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A very long on tough book to read. It was written in a different time and place. Victor Hugo put together an epic tale. Often you has cause to wonder why he went off on such a tangent, but eventually the tangent is woven back into the tale in remarkable ways. After several weeks I'm a little less than half way through, but it has been a worth while trip so far. Miserables is an apt title. Reading it makes you appreciate the time and place we live in.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|it is a great way to kill time as well as zombies until you die then you fight for the zombies
B000UX6THK|5.0|Not only is the show great, the special features are good also. The Kyle MacLachlan SNL monlogue and Twin Peaks Skit are bittersweet. The sketch is funny the late Chris Farley and  the late David Hartman are in the skit reminding one of the loss of two funny men.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|When your doing any kind of math or chem who wants adds flashing making it a distraction. And whats worse is this review has to be twenty words......  adds  all I can say.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great for a quick check of the weather conditions. Gives all the information you need to be prepared for you day weatherwise.
B00628RVV0|5.0|My teenage grandson has been studying the holocaust and wanted to see some movies. Rather than starting him off with Schlindler's List, I started him off with this. It broke his heart, it made him cry, but it really drove home the very real human toll when so much is so often lost in the sheer numbers of the holocaust. I watched it with him and was moved by the sheer simplistic beauty and poignancy of this story. One of the best holocaust films I have seen. Highly recommended, but not without a box of Kleenex.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book will hold your attention until the last page I couldn't wait the get to the last page of the last book. I can't wait for the movie!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it! I enjoyed all three books! I can't wait for the movies to come out! I would recommend the trilogy to anyone!
B004UID2LC|4.0|ok I like this app but don't download TRUST ME GUYS<br />don't do it. Because it will not let me download a song I want so I upgrade it and know its so stinks now
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It is so much fun to play! Not hard to understand. A nice and relaxing game. I love to play it!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It moved slow and was written almost like a diary. No bull, no fluff, no personal life diatribes...I recommend.<br />Thats really all I can say.
B009329Y30|5.0|This movie is very romantic and even my hubby enjoyed it. It's a great date night movie.<br />And Zac Efron is a man now. Drooling allowed!
B000002OOZ|5.0|I put this in my cassette player in my Jeep Wrangler while trail riding in the mountains. My wife says I was a dork but it brough back memories of my still #1 favorite movie ever made to this day. I was 5 when I first saw the movie in theaters. The quality for a cassette was very good.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is a really good book. Series can and needs to be continued.Great read wish there was more too it.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I having been hoping for years, that one of the greatest adventure series, ever put to film would come out, on Blu ray........<br />well I can tell you this, watching Raiders on my oppo blu ray player, hooked to my samsung LED TV.......and enjoyng the audio thru my Bose Surround system.........has been a highly enjoyable experience, the picture quality is breath taking, its hard to believe these movies were made, quite a while back............the blu ray transfer, truly is steller, If your a fan of these movies, I highly reccomend this purchase, you will be blown away, by the high quality, of this blu ray set, as well as the packaging, it truly is worthy of a purchase, you will thank me!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day.. is not promoted as giving any secret information about the raid by Seal Team 6 that resulted in the death of Bin Laden.. in fact.. the author is very up front that if that is what you're looking for.. then this isn't the book for you..<br />What the book is though is an interesting read that will  give you an idea about the life and activity of Navy Seals and how many different operations they might be involved in that you don't realize..<br />The training.. and more training.. and even more training that goes into operations only to be called off at the last minute.. the constant living on the edge of having friends and colleagues killed in battle..all make it into the story.. and give you a good idea what the life of Seal is all about.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed the second and third books but found the first one a little overwhelming.  I enjoyed these more as there was more of a story to them.  I found all 3 very repetitive in alot of the story.  The last book of the series was the best as it had more of a story to it.<br /><br />NOT RECOMMENDED FOR YOUNG TEENS!!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I like a lot of people was quite curious about this book, and found it quite amazing.  I realize there was a lot of concern from the government and some people in the military that operational secrets and operational tactics would somehow be compromised, in my reading I found this not to be the case.  The author gives a detailed account leading up to his mission, including this mental and physical preparedness as well as the tactical.You  just don't walk away reading this book and think I am getting to know a soldier, but also a very motivated and courageous individual.  His  detail in describing the events not only personal but also emotional gives a clear insight on the danger and preparation of such a mission.  You feel like you're actually training and are experiencing his sense of danger and fear, while actually you're safe at home and admiring this tremendous courage.  If I had a chance I would like to have the opportunity to thank these men and this man in particular for his service and loyalty to our country.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played in. my life. there are a lot of different game on this app.
B0088ETCHW|5.0|Congratulations to the authors of this excellent book.<br />The book is very well organized going through steps that truly help in understanding our mistakes.<br />I can give you my experience:<br />I am a 50 years old guy that since five years ago is doing some master competition.<br />My swimming back ground is poor as I started swimming in competitions when I was 16 years old and ended when I was 23.<br />My very best times in 100 m crawl were always very close to 1 minute. It was clearly a plateau.<br />When I restarted swimming I could not do better than 1min 9 seconds but with the age coming it started being difficult to maintain that time and last July I was falling to 1 min 13.<br />When training series (10x100 leaving each 2 minutes) I could not do better than 1 min 45 sec each 100m. Even if in the first two series I could do 1 min 40 sec it was not being possible to sustain.<br />Some weeks ago I bought the book and I realized that I was doing an incredible high number of mistakes.<br />I jumped to my first season train and I decided to concentrate in few things that I learnt I was doing wrong.<br />It was fantastic: a serie of  10 x 100 m done with all 100 m in less than 1 min 30! And it was incredible easy.<br />I just corrected the breathing and avoid over gliding as I was doing.<br />But the best part is that I could identify many aspects more that I need to correct.<br />Again congratulations to the authors of this excellent book. Truly recommended.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Finally we get a true accounting to the end of the FBI's most wanted. This book was amazing!  After hearing so many false accounts from the press, I knew they had no clue to what really happened.  A must read if you love the USA!!!
0525953728|5.0|This riveting first-hand account of (pseudonym) Navy Seal Mark Owen... despite all the media hoopla of divulging classified secret information... is simply a well laid out account of not only Mark Owen's involvement in the killing of deranged (I personally think the use of this term is much better than the use by some of the term mastermind... as attacking thousands of unarmed, innocent civilians... to me should not be equated with a mastermind!) terrorist leader Bin Laden (Note: Bin Laden was referred to as UBL by the Seals and Government officials.)... but also a tale of Mark's youthful desires growing up in Alaska and dreaming of being in the Navy.<br /><br />The author expertly grabs the reader's attention early on as you're almost immediately in the helicopter with the handpicked team of Seals on the way to kill Bin Laden. The story then veers very smoothly back in time to what it takes to become a Seal... and then the reader is effortlessly taken through multiple training classes and exercises as well as actual missions through the years such as the famous takeover of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama that was on the way to Mombasa, Kenya, by Somali pirates. Mark was also involved years earlier in a misguided attempt to get Bin Laden.<br /><br />A number of themes are made abundantly clear... ranging from the dedication behind the scenes by all Navy Seals... to the constant \\"busting-of-chops\\" between the brotherhood of Seals that is one of the key components of keeping spirits high... and as an Honorably-Discharged-Viet-Nam-Era-Veteran... it's comforting to see that though our weaponry may have changed... and our enemies... may have changed... and though political correctness continues to get nauseatingly worse every day... that the pride and competitiveness... and comradery of the Patriotic American Serviceman is still intact within our elite warriors. When one of the greatest... most historical moments in military history is accomplished... it is almost tear inducing when the UBL mission is completed unbelievably successfully... without one American casualty... how self-effacing our American heroes were.<br /><br />And yet... much to the chagrin of the author and many of his comrades... how much credit President Obama tried... and to this moment... continues to try and shine on himself did not sit well with the men. After a congratulatory speech and meeting with the President and V.P. the author states: \\"BIDEN KEPT CRACKING LAME JOKES THAT NO ONE GOT. HE SEEMED LIKE A NICE GUY, BUT HE REMINDED ME OF SOMEONE'S DRUNKEN UNCLE AT CHRISTMAS DINNER.\\"<br /><br />If you really pay attention to the author's feelings throughout the book... which are not much different from the author's feelings in many other books on much less famous battles and missions... the price our greatest warriors pay besides the possible loss of their lives or physical prowess... is the dissolution of many of their marriages and families.<br /><br />Being on constant call... ready to go anywhere... at any time... always with the cameras and spotlights off... unless turned on later for political benefit. I know what it feels like to be half way around the world without one person that loves you... even knowing where you are. That's a price that can never have a dollar amount on it that can be justified.<br /><br />And tack on to that the ungodly weight of an ever-growing burden of an abundantly asinine *RULES OF ENGAGEMENT* that no one but the United States shackles on to the back of our fighting forces. G-D BLESS AMERICA... and I hope every American that reads this book remembers what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said:<br /><br />** \\"THOSE WHO HAVE LONG ENJOYED SUCH PRIVILEGES AS WE ENJOY... FORGET IN TIME... THAT MEN HAVE DIED TO WIN THEM!\\" **ucing when the UBL mission is completed unbelievably successfully... without one American casualty... how self-effacing our American heroes were.<br /><br />And yet... much to the chagrin of the author and many of his comrades... how much credit President Obama tried... and to this moment... continues to try and shine on himself did not sit well with the men.

B0058BI864|5.0|This is the best show ever. It's smart, witty, hilarious. I can watch and rewatch it without getting bored. Keep up the good work!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was the worst of the hunger games series.  If I had read this one first I wouldn't have read the others.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Easy,  fun,  and only a little frustrating when u have to wait 30 seconds for a coin,  once you have blown through your cache.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really wasn't sure if I would enjoy this book but to my surprise I couldn't put it down. I read all 3 in 6 days. I was reading it every chance I wasn't working. The storyline was great. I had to keep reading to see what happened next. I bought the kindle version and then decided to buy the actual books to keep in my bookcase. Great book. Hope she writes more...
B00846REIS|1.0|DO NOT BUY!!! Complete rip off of 50. The characters were awful and the story line was worse. My first and last Sylvia day book
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is epic its just like the Pc version it has creative mode and normal. it is worthy. to pay $7
0385344333|3.0|It's not the best Reacher, but it's not the worst, either. Hard to be specific without spoilers, but suffice it to say that if you can suspend belief in a number of scenes (and not the heroic scenes, just some set up scenes) it's an ok story. Some parts of the storyline seem recycled from other Reacher novels, and Reacher himself is beginning to become a bit of a caricature. Hopefully the next one will give us something that's a bit more of an intellectual challenge for Reacher. Solution at the end was flat.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|After the abrupt end of part one of this trilogy I just had to read the Second Part Unfortunately it did not live up to the expectations and I ended up scanning it after the first 100 pages. Now I decided to wait for the film instead of reading part three...
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book is great!  Follett's ability to develop characters and story lines is magnificent. I'm looking forward to the final two books in this trilogy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is the first Hugh Howey I've read, and it will certainly not be the last. The scene is progressively set up in a masterful, theatre-like way, with each of the five novels being almost an act of an utterly riveting piece. Excellent character design, well-paced scenario, quite original in its approach of a \\"behind closed doors\\" SF story. It certainly contrasts with your typical drama-full space opera, but what it lacks in grandeur, it more than makes up for in terms of psychology, State-sociology and civil disobedience in a post-apocalyptic environment.<br />Difficult to categorise, and proudly so: a great read, for a great price, there's no excuse to miss such a delicious piece of novelty in the world of science fiction.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Harold Fry walks to \\"save\\" a long time friend and along the way discovers his own life has not been a meaningful one. Not to give any spoilers but the last few chapters bring the reader the reasons for Harold and his wife's alienation.  Enjoy!
0738711500|5.0|I must say this is the best tarot deck I've bought! The book included is wonderful at explaining details without overwhelming the reader and she didn't spend time on the minor details. There were other spreads included in the book which has helped me as well. I recommend this book to all, beginners like me and advance tarot readers!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|With this app i can keep track of all my work projects and my daughters. I can use it on multiple equipment is a plus for me.
B003O86FMW|4.0|it was pretty good but not quite as gripping as the first novel. I enjoyed it and thought it was worth reading.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I bought this for my fiance for Xmas.  She loved it!  She played while making Christmas dinner.  She said enough with the Xmas songs, I'm listening to this sweet songbird today.
B008QZ1ZYQ|1.0|This game is very boring and bland. the concept is a dead end and the game isn't that good. If you're 3 years old I'm sure it's pretty fun.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Heartwarming and very well written. This book made me laugh and touched me as well. My only criticism is the exaggerated scenarios from the orphanage. They lacked the subtlety present in the rest of the book's well-rounded characters. In particular the description of abuse by the family that takes Jaime in. Still, an incredible first novel. I want to read more by this author. Truly masterful writing at points.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book has many twist and turns. The story just keeps you wanting to read on and on. Can't wait to read the next book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as good, if not better than Book 1! keeps you on the edge of your seat and has an ending you never see coming...
B009329ZF2|3.0|This is another typical made for TV sci-fi thriller that provides some gratifying scenes while avoiding any significant plot lines or complicated characters.  If you must know, I was bored to death the evening I rented this and the result was I enjoyed some mindless victorious moments.  Definitely not going to win any awards for the actors - many of whom are kicking proverbial butt on other networks, shows, etc..  If you've got the time, this movie will provide what you need at the time.  Still, no more than three generous stars.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Mad Men has got to be one of the best shows ever produced. And the 5th season does not disappoint.
B00932HEX2|3.0|Instead of the phrenetic pace of \\"24\\" or other high pitched spy thrillers, this show is plodding, understated and sometimes down right boring - somewhat like real life.  The idea is great, you just have to have a tolerance for the slow pace and the sometimes downright mundane approach to spy craft and the lives of spies.  It reminds me of \\"Tinker, Tailor,...\\" except that was far more depressing - probably because it took over two hours and this show sets you free from the torture in less than 60 minutes.  I gave it 3 stars because they obviously tried hard, but in reality it is only worth two stars.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Not a great movie.  It was just ok. I watched it and it passed the time, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have had many other weather apps for Kindle Fire and my IPhone. I really love this app. It has always been dead on with it's radar.
B007Z9R69M|4.0|Great action and awesome performance from Gina Carano. One of her hand to hand combat scenes is worth the whole movie!
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Good for a light,  fun read. Recommended for those who do not dissect books. Would read more from this author.
B007X16GFC|5.0|While the movie is a typical movie for Mr. Walhberg, I found it entertaining and worth the $5 that I spent on renting it.
B009329Y30|4.0|Loved this movie. Zach has grown up! A good date night movie or just a girls night out. I would even watch it again.
B00932A2MC|4.0|My wife and I found this movie very entertaining, though not realistic at all. That was part of the fun though was picking it apart.
B000QUCNOU|5.0|A genre-defying film can bewilder critics and frustrate audiences.  Often, people want to know what it is they're watching or critiquing.  But in the case of an absolutely fantastic movie, who the hell cares!  And Zodiac is truly a fantastic movie.  It's gripping, intelligently shot, flawlessly directed, and the cast is top notch.<br /><br />The story is widely known by now: It's San Francisco in the late 1960's and the cops are playing cat and mouse with a batshit crazy killer who taunts them by sending cryptic letter to the newspaper - letters that foreshadow future murders while referencing previous ones.<br /><br />The tension in this film is so palpable that it does occasionally cross the line into the horror genre: take the scene with the young couple in the park...in BROAD daylight!  And also the one with the single mother driving alone at night on a lonesome stretch of interstate.  Chilling stuff.<br /><br />With a script by James Vanderbilt (he wrote some of the Spiderman scripts) and direction by the wonderful David Fincher (maybe look into his resume!), this seems to be one of those films that the public simply didn't know where to place.  Is it thriller or horror or mystery?  Again, who cares.  See it and experience a wonderful American film.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|My daughter got the app, and is on it as much as I let her. She hasnt complained about it yet.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Still can't believe I'm into a biker club series but it is great.  Pretty gritty but very good.  Love the characters and the story line.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|The war of art goes to exact root cause of why we fall short on our promises. It explains the difference between the amateur and the professional. It touches the soul and gives the simple explanation of why we fail and succeed. A must if you want to change the right things in your life.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|in great conditions! the movie was like new.  very happy with the product. and the price was a  better than any store.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have honestly never read a book with characters quite like the ones portrayed in Gone Girl.  I am not even sure I can find words to describe how fantastic of a book Gone Girl is.  I could not put it down, I could not get enough of the book or it's characters.  I 100% recommend this book.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This is a very good book with plenty of twists in the plot. I look forward to reading other books from this author.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first two books kept my interest but Mockingjay did not.  I kept thinking that Katniss didn't need three books to make up her mind about which man she loved.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Great album,she rocks out! Saw her and her great band mates live last year. They were great and this album is worth a listen.
B0014EU5XI|5.0|if you took lightnin hopkins and electrified it and had a really really good band, then put twice as many tracks as you usually get, this is what you will purchase here.<br />i was surprised at the quality of the guitar work - i had no idea zz top was this technically good.
B0018AT890|5.0|I found this track very soulful and after hearing it come multiple times in the movie, I started the hunting process and found it :)<br />So, if you are like me who wants to purchase just one track, I would highly recommend this.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love the different levels and the storyline. The graphics are amazing and the tiles very creative. This is a must for puzzlers
B0086700CM|5.0|Definitely my favorite free game! Its fun and easy and for me a stress reliever. I have a kindle fire and it works great.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|very well designed game.hard at times but at the same time i enjoy playing..Its like u can go and go playing saying one last time ;)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved this book from start to finish. It's about time somebody told the truth about what happened. It seems harder and harder to get the truth from the media and our government agencies , thanks again for a great read and the truth!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A Feast for Crows: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book 4 in George Martin's series Game of Thrones was both enthralling and aggravating.  He is a superb writer, a master of description and sentence structure. I love to read a well-written book and all of his books so far have been a feast for my brain. His characterizations come alive. It is no effort at all to imagine everything he writes about. I have fallen in love with characters that I despised on the tv show. As is usually the case, the book(s) is so much better than the tv series, not that it is bad, but the books are miles above the tv series. I was disappointed that Books 4 and 5 should have been one, but have been divided into two books. Without spoiling anything, I wasn't happy with the conclusion of some characters. When I found out that others had waited 5 yrs. to get Book 5, I was flapperghasted, but I hope the wait for Book 6 won't be that long. If you love high fantasy, dragons, kings, queens, princesses, and \\"bastards,\\" then this series is for you. Personally, I pull for the \\"bastards.\\"
B008MG1E4A|2.0|After all the hype the book is pretty much a rehash of other tales about the SEALs. i did not see a single item which either needed to be kept secret or which was not already general knowledge. The description of the raid on OBL differs from the \\"official' version but only in detail. Some of the euphemisms are great. After the point man has shot OBL in the head he and the author \\"engage\\" him a couple of more times in the body. I can hear it now ,\\"Don't engage; I surrender.\\"<br />On the other hand, if you have not read anything about the SEAls, this will tell you much of what you would like to know.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|was very interesting and I believe accurate in detail.  I didn't catch any written word that gave secrets out to the public as the DOD charged. Seems the media was upset more than others. Very well written, left a few details out about the helo. crash that would have been interesting. I am just glad they killed the sob instead of taking him alive. Recommend it highly as a recruiting tool for the Navy.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Ahead of the controversy which seems to have been attached to this book, I wanted to read it to learn more of the SEALS and of, in particular, the mission that finally \\"got\\" Osama Bin Laden. Having read the book, I wonder if many of those who are criticizing it and complaining about the author have actually read it. I find, for example, no boasting here. I find a quiet, careful, thoughtful narrative who emphasizes the positives of training and focus and the bravery and sacrifice of those in the unit (not just him, not any way close--the praise is heaped more on the others!). I was not startled by any \\"secrets\\" (it seems that the reaction, to me, from official circles is more of fear of embarassment--not because those circles did anything wrong, but from foot-dragging, mission creep and the desire to stick an oar in where it might do more wrong than good). I don't even find anything overtly political (towards or against either side of the aisle). We need to celebrate our victories, to praise those who sacrifice, this book does both. A fast read and I've already loaned my copy out (I have both the paper and electronic versions) three times. Highly recommended.
B000LRVLPK|3.0|The case in which the watch was received was broken. I was disappointed that greater care was not taken to package the item. I was unsure what to do about the item.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|All in All a pretty decent movie. I think Jennifer Lawrence is a Good Actor, It had good action and it didn't have all of the over the top special effects, which I am beginning to get tired of watching.
B008602KQI|5.0|On vacation last spring, I visited my grandsons who were so excited about the coming release of this movie. They wanted me to take them to see it. But first they made me read the book. I ended up reading the whole trilogy. I find it really hard to put a book down and not know how the story ends. Anyway, the book, I felt, was a little too old for them with the violence in it but, It was so well written that the violence was secondary to the story that was being told. So, I took them to the movies to see \\"The Hunger Games\\" and enjoyed it immensely. The actors were superb (every one of them) and it was done very tastefully. Cant wait for the next to come out. I will plan my next vacation accordingly so I can take my grandsons again, my treat.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I just can't get past the style of this book - it's a collection of many little stories about WWZ.  There is an order to it all, but there isn't much more to grab onto than a few pages at a time.  It's like a book with too many characters -- after a while, I stopped paying attention to names and places altogether.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Magic Puzzles is a great time waster.  Coding needs some work as purchased puzzles can disappear but are easily restored.  The puzzles and good and you can control the degree of difficulty.
B00932IQIO|2.0|My own fault for contiuing to buy this. Starts well but then bogs down into repetion and awful writing and direction. Please save your money.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is amazing! I would reccomend this to anyone!<br />Especially if you haven't played minecraft! I cant wait to see what the next update will be...
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Some of the favorite parts we enjoy are the jetpacks and the gadgets, like Flash.<br />You will enjoy having him because he collects spin tokens and coins.  He also turns<br />into the vehicles when you earn them.  Enjoy the game.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Easy read, very informative about the lifes of Navy Seals and the attack on OBL. Short read and I didn't feel any classified information was leaked.
B0087HT36U|3.0|This can get a little redundant But overall not a bad But overall not a bad game. Only three stars.
1440503257|5.0|For those who expect to find butter beer in here its not!! It has all kinds of food from the book, many things they ate all over the place. Each recipe has a story about where it was eaten in the books. Me brothers and I try to make something out of it every holiday!
B007FG9LIE|3.0|It maybe closer to what lies ahead for us earth people than we realize.<br />I found it very interesting and read it in one day.  Kept the mystery going.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|They are not expensive and durable, high quality. My daughter loves this toy. I bought other toys (made in China) the quality was so poor, you cannot compare with this one.
0385344333|2.0|I was looking forward to this book so much and had pre-ordered it.  Once I started reading it, however, I realized how disappointed I was going to be.  What a horrible book from such a good writer and a great character.  This book felt just driving through Nebraska and Kansas...boring, tedious, and seemingly endless.  I realize it must be hard to continue writing one character and keep it fresh, but Lee Child really blew it with this book.  I would just avoid it if at all possible.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Fun, easy, and helps improve math skills. Very simple and easy to understand. Great for people of all ages 7 and up.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Erotic - great to re-kindle your sex life. A book all women should read and keep an open mind. Book badly written but overall the theme very intriguing and could't wait to turn to the next page.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Just enough preamble to establish the fact that the author knows what he's talking about, and more than enough detail to establish the fact that he was there!  I spent more than thirty years in the Navy, most of it in Naval or National Intelligence, and I find the narrative is specific enough to capture the excitement but cautious enough to stay well within the boundary of operational security.  This book makes an important contribution to the reputation of special operations personnel and makes it clear that much that has been published previously on this subject was self-serving political drumbeating. Bravo Zulu!
B000JMKQX0|1.0|Couldn't get into this writing. Too much of an interview & I appreciate character development. Gives the story some depth. This was more like watching the talking heads reporting what's written for them at the news hour.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I wasn't disappointed at all by the book.  Once again, a real page turner with lots of twists to keep the mind guessing!
B008BM9L72|5.0|If these books are taken as a story of young love it is a beautiful story.<br />Why does everyone have to put dirty sex in everything they read. It is only telling you what you and your partner are possibly doing. I enjoyed it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|this was my first experience reading Gillian Flynn, and i was REALLY impressed.. this book was excellent, and i didn't see it coming until i got to the very end. looking forward to Gone Girl.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I have read a few books on strength and conditioning. I have paid a personal trainer. I belonged to a gym... I wish I would have read this first! The author relates his own story & experiences about prison. He gives a cool history lesson of calisthenics. Then, he gets right into a description of the workout & exercises.<br /><br />There is a STRONG sense of urgency to get tough and strong in prison. As I read the book- I am forcing that urgency on myself. It's easy (for me) to put off a workout. But I tell myself and believe- I MUST DO THIS. I have to get fit! If you are a gym rat- you probably have more motivation than me. But this concept helped me a lot.<br /><br />The book is expensive for a Kindle download- but it is much cheaper than one session with a personal trainer. I'm glad I bought it & recommend to anyone.
B0083EW97W|2.0|Let me just say: I love John Mayer.  He may be crazy, but I think he is one of the best musicians we have from my generation and I will support him no matter what.  That being said, I must admit I'm not crazy about this album.  I was such a HUGE fan of Continuum and Battle Studies; this album just sort of falls short of those two.  I understand he was trying to return to his more acoustic roots, I'm just not sure it really succeeded on this attempt.  Either way, I will look forward to the next album all the same!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a co-worker.  She raved about her inability to put this book down.  After reading it in 4 days, I would have to agree.  I stayed up late several nights saying....\\"just one more chapter\\".  Before I knew it I had read 3 more and it was after midnight.  It was such a great story.  I will definitely be putting this on my re-read pile.  I look forward to more Jamie McGuire books.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Such a beautiful, haunting voice!  I really don't think Florence & Co. can do any wrong, and this album just proves that point for me.  In my opinion, the mark of a good album is one you can listen to on repeat and not get sick of it; let's just say my iPod has been working overtime these last few months since I purchased \\"Ceremonials\\"!!
B008YRVW0I|1.0|Gets interesting then it's blocked and makes you have to buy it to continue game play. Not cool at all.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Cant belive some of the negative feedback. I love character detail and depth for the plot. Even if the story as a whole does move forward as much as some would like, it doesnt take away from anything as thats just a preferance. The book is not the best in the series but does an awesome job off adding to the series as a whole.  I personally highly recommend reding this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|this was one of most creative stories I think I've ever read.  Very hard to put down.  Enjoyed it but was not crazy about ending.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a really good book and hard to put down.  Did he kill her or didn't he?  I really liked all the twists and turns.  Only problem was the ending.  Is it just me or did anyone else hate it! I was kind of hoping for more.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Like the layout, the huge variety of articles, enjoy some of the slide show options.  Kindle fire says \\"not compatible\\" for the videos, haven't figured that out yet, but okay with the wealth of reading material.
B0072S9KU4|3.0|I was surprised that this movie turned out to be interesting and with a lot of action. I expected a c type vampire movie.
0345803485|5.0|I love how fast my order was shipped. And I LOVE this book, I am enjoying this read..me time and taking notes!!!
B006QSL9XC|5.0|I have probably watched this movie 4 time and it gets better everytime.<br />If I had any ctiticism it would be the obvious fake beards on the Southern Generals.<br />I have read about the battle of Gettysburg and this movie is as close to the actual facts as could be<br />with the directors need for improvised dialoge.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I just saw these guys live, which makes me love their music even more.  Great deal for some great music.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I have all the respect for our men and women in uniform.  Seal Team Six are testosterone filled, adrenaline junkies,lean, mean, killing machines who are away from their families ten months out of the year.<br />However, I bought this book because I surmised that it would be about the raid to kill Bin Laden.  This book is about the author, about his trials to get into Seal Team 6. The author speaks of many missions as a Seal Team 6 member. It goes on and on and on about his special ops missions in Iraq and Afganistan.  As a woman, I find the description of the kills difficult to read. About 3/4ths of the way through, the author speaks of the raid and subsequent aftermath.  I wish to thank him, his unit, and all our men in uniform for keeping our country safe.  Too bad the press spoiled the best part of this book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A lot of people are talking about all the sexual content and they are not looking at the whole story line.  The story is so good.  I love the innocence of both the characters.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show! Even if english is not my first language, I find the jokes very funny and each time I watch it there is something new! And the good thing about it, if you miss a show, you can still watch and understand what is going on. And be carefull it's addictive!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The story is so great!!!! Can't wait to see what happens!!!!  Love both characters!!! The story line is so great---people have to see the emotions of the characters and not just the sex!!!
0425263908|1.0|I don't even know where to start or what to say. I don't<br />even care that this book is a 50 Shades rip off, I knew that when I bought it. That is reason most people ARE buying it in the first place. It goes from decent to just plain creepy and gross. They bump into each other at work and start screwing non stop and cannot leave each others sight, but not in a romantic way. They get off on each others pasts of horrible sexual abuse. Its gross how memories of being raped turn you on? I don't know, I have started skipping all the sex scenes b/c they are getting just plain gross. The characters are not likeable and they give you no chance to really even get to know them. Much like Gideion and Eva don't really even know each other. This book is STUPID and frankly kinda creepy.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I go on it all the time. I love this game and everything is free definetley recommend it.Get the game.
B007SNMYNS|5.0|Very informative and a real eye opener....although YEARS ago my mother complained that wheat \\"wasn't what it used to be\\"  but when I read about all the genetically changed wheat from seed, growth and processing, it gave me a much better understanding of how it adversely affects people all over the world.  No wonder we suffer from so much obesity, diabetes and chronic arthritis problems.  Definitely recommend reading this book.
B008WK30XO|4.0|Though it does not reach the heights of O' Brother Where Art Thou, this film scores mix of bluegrass makes for a great album.  And its all about white lightning.
0143119680|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  If you like books about witches, vampires, etc. and also like fantasy then this book<br />is for you.  It is well written and the characters come to life as you read.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Everything in the movie felt forced on you. There was no character development so you felt nothing when they started to die. You're supposed to feel bad for the main characters because they are poor, but it should have been more than just that.
B0090EIILU|1.0|Stupid. Just stupid. What a waste of money and time. Don't bother if you're over the age of 7. Make that over the age of 5.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love this site. can be a bit addicting though. i can be on it forever pinning and looking at pics my friends have pinned
B008D28HYS|5.0|Excellent puzzle-type game.  At first you don't know what you're doing but soon you catch on.  Some lines are s-o-o-o easy (you think)only to find out that you are wrong! There's a lot of juggling to satisfy the parameters of each line across and downward. Fun, interesting, and challenging.
B001LM1456|4.0|I liked this movie while its not the best movie ever it was better than I was expecting it to be
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Not too far into the book, I realized the book was parallel to the past TV series, THE UNIT. If you have seen the series, you've read the book. The OBL chapters were the extension of the series, only the book is non-fiction. The writer uses discretion (names, places,times,events and sequences), so the reader is left to wonder what of significance, that would separate the TV series from the book, was omitted for national security concerns. I felt nothing shocking or revealing was made known that the TV series had not already depicted.....in fact, I now give the TV series more credit than I would have while the series was airing as the book, in its' own sense, confirms the TV series. I gave the book 4 stars because I treasure non-fiction written by the hands-on and I give very much respect and thanks to those who are so dedicated.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|I Read all three of the Hunger Games Trilogy books. The movie for anyone who has not read the books is a complete waste of time. The Film makers should have added at least fifteen minutes to the beginning  to set up the hunger games. The movie was a total disappointment. I watched the movie with friends who after the movie was over asked what was it about. I guess that shows how inept the effort to translate the book to film was.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|I have read several of Ken Follett's books, and wanted to read another.  I didn't want to be disappointed though after reading some awesome books to start.  I got the kindle version of Jackdaws on a hunch that it would be similar to Eye of the Needle.<br /><br />Jackdaws had all the intrigue, mystery and character development that Eye had and then some.  The book is written about a period of history that I didn't know too much about and it gives you a good background on the time and events.<br /><br />Overall, a great book by Follett.  If you like his other books, don't hesitate to read this as well.
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading 50 Shades, this book was right up there for hot romances. I can't wait for the next book to come out in October, I will be downloading it right away!
B003AVPV1O|5.0|Briefly, it is so great to receive something that is made well, fits well, does what it is supposed to & arrives quickly....
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a great book but the other 2 books were far better. I don't like the way the charters changed and it seemed like we spent so much time in the mind if katnis. I don't like how violent the book becomes.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I found myself thoroughly immersed in this book from beginning to end. Isaacson does a wonderful job of giving us a clear picture of who and what Steve Jobs was. I found it very interested to see the way a true genius like him thought and acted in different situations, even though his behaviour was far from ideal in most cases. For anyone who has any interest in the life of Steve Jobs, this book is a must-read.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|Great out of the box thinking movie. Really liked it. Classic drama. If you want action or explosion it's not for you. This is for people that are tired of the same old cookie cutter movies we have been seeing for years. I mean really how many times can you see a Spiderman movie.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|My wife and I began watching this show after we caught an episode of it on our honeymoon cruise.  Very funny and always engaging.  This is one of my 'must watch' shows.  The characters have great personality and the show keeps that, and most other events that have happened in the show, consistent so you sometimes get special nuggets or a better understanding of something that has happened in a past episode by watching the new ones.  Especially enjoyed being able to stream it over Amazon and not having to deal with having more DVDs around.
B008602KQI|3.0|This movie was real close to the book. I am glad i read the book first. Movie skipped alot and was kind of lost. You must read book first.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've loved this app ever since I first downloaded it. My favorite part is the fact it tells you how much energy you have left with Internet browsing, music, games and video. Its a great idea to make it a free app with the option to pay for the upgraded version. I give this program a 15/10!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|frustrating.  a lot of coins go off the side as well as the goodies.  after 30 secs you get 1 (one) coin so you end up selling your prizes.  you get to go up levels quickly and there is a jig-saw puzzle for extra coins but none of my pieces seem to fit anything.  I'll probably get rid of it just because of the 30second wait which is way too often. that's the deal-breaker for me.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Ewan did a fine job! so w/ Emily Blunt.. good chemistry! I find it humorous. I even watched 2x in a row just to make me feel happy or something. Maybe I find Ewan's eyes and face profile so charmingly enticing!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that they should have the demo in app store. I mean, I had no money and was wanting to play the demo until I could buy the full version. Just to get a feeling of what the PE will be like. I know that this has nothing to do with my rating. But It's fun and all but flying should be more that jumping and floating. I have to go out and find a big hill and climb to the top to get to a good bight. I do hope that you will be able to fly in the next update. But other than that, keep up the good work Notch and Jeb!!!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|would trust a navy seal over obama any day of the week.<br />this story is well told. honest version of what really happened...the US NAVY SEALS killed osama bin laden, not barack obama who wouldn't know which end of a gun to hold.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Hurry up with the sequel!!  This was VERY fast paced and kept my attention through to the end and left wanting the next book.<br /><br />Loved the dog!<br /><br />If you are a hard bitten Historical Fantasy reader or just a newbie, you will welcome this story.  Kind of reminiscent of Game of Thrones but better in my opinion.  Especially keeping the cast of characters manageable.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to buy this one.
B004ATUEJY|5.0|I purchased this MP3 soundtrack after I had purchased the other Dirty Dancing soundtrack that Amazon had advertised to be on sale and sent to me via e-mail for like $3.  It was after I had purchased, downloaded, and listened to the entire album did I realize too late that the album was incomplete, and since it was my own fault for not checking prior I didn't bother calling customer service to get my money back; plus, like I said it was only $3.  The Legacy Edition has EVERY (last) song from start to finish that played throughout the movie.  Listening to the album always envokes all the various scenes in my head that they take part in (yes, I have watched the movie that much!)to the point that it is like watching the movie without having to turn on the television.
B00933U1EU|5.0|Engaging start for a new series.  The acting is very good and there is a good deal of tension to keep the episode interesting.
B005OP821K|5.0|I didn't start watching Revenge on ABC until about mid-season after a couple of friends were raving about it.  The first episode I watched was the mid-season recap that caught me up to that point.  Intrigued I watched the 2nd and 3rd episodes following and was hooked.  I really like the drama, and one upmanship of Emily and her main protagonist Victoria Grayson.  I also like the orignality of the television show's plot.  So many new programs today are either spin-offs of other shows, reality (crap) TV, or just the same ol' thing wrapped with the same stale and boring plot lines.  It is for those reasons I no longer subscribe to cable nor watch (LIVE)television anymore I just purchase the Season Pass of my favorite programs here at Amazon and watch via my computer, Roku, or iPad when I am ready commerical free.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|I am skimming this guide on my Droid 3, and find it to be informative and well written. I'd like to see another book that covers the myriad Linux bits that help one use Raspbian (really, any Debian) effectivley. Experinced Linux hands don't need that, but teh RaspI universe is populated by a gazillion folks who are either rusty re Linux (me) or new to the experience.

B000FA6720|5.0|The book was slow moving at first, but once I got about half-way through, I couldn't put it down.  Might be one of the greatest and most tragic love stories of all time.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I read the first book recently.  I immediately downloaded this book, and I am reading this book now.  I can't put them down.  Great books.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I downloaded CrossMe Color to try something new and have been hooked since. The puzzles get progressively harder, but they're a lot of fun to solve. I've been playing this everyday, just love it!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was hooked on this game the first time I played it.  It didn't take a lot of thought, but it drew me into the game right away.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Even though I read reviews on this book that weren't very flattering, I had to read it, due to the hype and talk of it I've heard from other women. The plot of the story was decent, even though it was a little cliche. The erotica of it, brought it to a different level. It was the way it was written that turned me off. Parts of the book were written well and quite sophisticated, but, like many reviews before mine, I got tired of reading the same phrases over and over again. Do people really repeat the same phrases to themselves, like that all the time? I don't like to think so. It's so boring. And the whole \\"inner goddess\\" I could do without. I thought it was stupid. These things made the story drag on longer than was really necessary. Needless to say my curiousity has gotten the best of me and I have just started book 2.
B005LAIHCM|5.0|Sarah has been recently divorced and she has searched for a new beginning with her daughter, Elissa.

Highly Recommended for thriller, mystery, and horror lovers!
B006ZNRD06|5.0|I was trying to get a certain movie to play on my Kindle but wasn't having any luck. This worked great! Thanks!
B00932A2MC|3.0|Battleship, while being a formula-driven action movie, is a lot of fun and shows that you can make a big-budget, \\"blow up everything\\" style movie without insulting the intelligence of your audience. Unfortunately, most summer blockbuster directors *cough*Michael Bay*cough* ruin their own movies with endless dialogue and cartoonish characters. If you have a nice big TV, make the popcorn, sit back and enjoy this movie.<br /><br />P.S. the casting of an actual wounded warrior was a smart bet that paid off well.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Decent programming and educational product, today's youth could really use this type game. Best of all it's free for today only.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is the only Mab Jo&ntilde;g game l've kept and played for a long time. Very entertaining! Even my granddaughters like it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I adore Pinterest. Period. But when it comes to organizing and editing my pins, I actually prefer to use the app. The only caveats I have are 1) I have to actually open a pin to like it, when I'd like to be able to just tap the screen and a heart pops up for me to click on. And 2) I can't rearrange my boards using the app...I kinda figured it would've been easier...using the drag and drop method on a touchscreen device and all. Just sayin'...it'd be A+ then!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game for when u are bored! great graphics! I love games where u can build up towns. this is one of my favorites.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|I really want to post a positive review but I have not played with this App enough for a full review. I did play a few games and it reminded me of WeeWar.com I like both games.<br />The game delivers on it promise, there are many maps and plenty of strategy to be used agains your opponent. It is the first turn-base strategy game I've played on my Android. It is a solid experience but I rarely fell like I need to Play another battle. Some kind of story would have help pull me back to the game. I've had back luck getting my friends to play against me for more that a game, that's not helping either.<br />The game is solid, there's just no hook.<br />I'm giving it 4 stars because all the issues I have are very personal, I can't make time to play it enough to enjoy it. For this that like this type of strategy game this is the first one I've really wanted to download. I don't regret the purchase, just wish I had more time to play.
0380807343|5.0|*received from publisher in exchange for an honest review!<br />I loved the movie Coraline when I saw it many years ago and I didn't remember that it was a book. When I received this book from the publisher to review I was really happy and dived into the book to read right away. The main character Coraline (from a adults point of view) can be a really sweet, smart child one moment and really rude the next. I can see young girls full of curiosity really relating to her as the author wrote Coraline how a typical girl her age would be.<br /><br />The book is written a simple but bold style. Although it says the book can be read by 8 year old and up, I'm not too sure about that. Some of Coraline is extremely, dark, creepy and out right disturbing. I would put this book at a reading level of about 10 and up. The language is simple enough while still challenging for a child that age to enjoy.<br /><br />The world that Gaiman builds is really magical and different. I enjoyed reading about \\"the other world\\" which is the world that mimics Coraline's real life, it starts off sounding great however it ends up being a nightmare. I like a creepy read and really enjoyed all the scary things that happened in \\"the other wold\\" again, not great for young children but extremely entertaining for children a little older. I really enjoyed the message this book builds on that even when your life doesn't seem perfect, a life that looks better is not always what it seems.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the movie as the movie stays extremely close to the book. It's a short read that will allow you to escape into a new world for a few hours.<br /><br />Rated Y-7-Disturbing and thematic elements<br /><br />Rating 5/5 Stars<br /><br />Janiera @ Books & Beauty
B008I3QZKU|3.0|The Killers has always been the kind of band that is able to come up with great tunes in order to release an album and I believe their first two records (Hot fuss-2004 and Sam's town-2006) were the proof that they were going somewhere. Afterwards, Day and Age-2008 was released and from this point on I started wondering where the band had the intention to end up. This particular record sounded as a attempt to sound like The Cure back in the late 80's but the effort wasn't strong enought and The killers were found as band trying to be another one but themselves.<br /><br />With Battle born-2012 the story is repeated and I believe this is because they don't really seem to know what they want to do with their sound anymore. Don't get me wrong, this album has great tunes but they're too immerse in the 80's nostalgia that is not really possible to understand if this is an album that the band produced in order to look for their identity or if they just felt comfortable with the way this set of songs sound. \\"Flesh and bone\\" and the most obvious \\"The way it was\\" are the perfect examples that support my previous statement. The single \\"Runaways\\" and \\"Miss atomic bomb\\" are two great songs as well that could be the friendliest for an average listener. My personal favorite so far (beside the single) is \\"Deadlines and commitments\\" because this track is the one that best describes The Killers trying to be \\"themselves\\" without leaning for too long on hooks and catchy words to build up a song. Unfortunely, the rest of the songs in Battle born are just ok but not strong enough to be memorable or timeless.<br /><br />The killers is a great band that's able to achieve thier own goals but they really need to find their identity soon and reflect it in a record that sounds more as their personality as a band than as a decade that is gone forever. The Sounds, another great band that I love, released last year their album \\"Something to die for\\" (2011) and in this album they found a sound where they could identify themselves (something that the members said in an interview after its release). I believe we need to ask The Killers if they feel the same way with \\"Battle born\\".re they could identify themselves (something that the members said in an interview after its release). I believe we need to ask The Killers if they feel the same way with \\"Battle born\\".
0385344333|1.0|I am a big Lee Child fan. I looked forward with anticipation to the newest Reacher novel. The last two novels prior to Wanted Man were disappointing, but they were still Reacher.<br />This feeble attempt is an insult to the memory of the man the author described as the\\"toughest man in literature.\\" Not a single fight.<br />Child has lapsed into formulaic plots: Start in a rural area, get involved in someone else's business, and escape from an exotic location against insurmountable odds. But the character development and detail which made earlier books so credible and fascinating is almost totally lacking here.<br />My advice: skip the latest and reread the earlier novels. They were written by an author who cared.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting, for sure a must read for all. The type of book that you wont be able to put down untill you finish reading it.
B0068THAGY|5.0|The first hour is very suspenseful. Well acted and shot. I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who is tired of \\"Yet Another Superhero\\" movie.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|A good quick read but not as compelling as other Reacher novels. Wouldn't have missed it though. Just can't imagine Tom Cruise playing the giant man Reacher in a movie.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Overall, I loved the whole series including this book. The ending just didn't do it for me. I really hope E L James writes the series again from Christian's POV. I think that would tie the whole series together! Other than that, I loved the book!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I rely pretty heavily on Google Calendar to keep track of my appointments.  When I got my new Kindle Fire HD, I decided to try to move as much of my productivity tasks to it as possible.  I hated the idea of having to enter calendar events into the Kindle and into my phone.  That ended up being not necessary with this app loaded on my Kindle Fire.  It syncs nicely with Google Calendar so that I only have to enter or change an appointment on one device.<br /><br />So far, it's a great app.  And it's free!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I watched it with my Grand Niece and Nephew and then again later with my 30 year old son. We all thoroughly enjoyed it and the message it gave to protect our environment.
B00000I8UD|5.0|This was a nice surprise, not to mention the perfect remedy for a frustrating day. Listening to this at the end of a day that included a wasted trip to the DMV and a shift at work mostly spent scratching my head at my assignments really help me relax and put everything into perspective. Dead Bees on a Cake can be best described as ambient dream pop with Eastern and smooth jazz stylings. It has a listless, mellow quality; the kind of music you would expect to hear while sitting in a coffee shop in a big city while the sun is setting. This mellow atmosphere turned me on to the album quickly, but what really struck me about it is how well it is structured. Aside from having a distinctive beginning, middle and end instead of coming across as just a collection of songs, it carefully avoids predictability and being repetitive by placing interludes or gear shifts at just the right moments. I don't really have anything bad to say about this album; all I can think of is that some of the three to four minute tracks were not up to the same standards as the album's longer ones.
B0031TZ9KS|5.0|I really really enjoyed this book! It is a very heart-warming and unique retelling from the point of view of an autistic individual. We feel what he experiences and see the world from his eyes - which is extremely enlightening if we do not know very much about Autism. The storyline is engaging, beginning with the death of a neighbour's dog by pitchfork, and the unravelling of the mystery behind the dog's death. With surprising twists and turns all related to the autistic boy's life, he uncovers the mystery as well as learns a great deal about his own family, his upbringing, and himself. We watch as he travels to unknown places for the first time and how he comes to terms with his fears and behaviours. It is a book worth reading!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Having read a number of modern, and less recent accounts of various military activities, I thought this was a fairly straightforward read.  I do not understand the controversy attached to this book.  There are a number of other recently published books that cover material that might be considered just as sensitive.  Perhaps this is just election year politics.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Maybe it's just the over hype, but this movie made me lose my \\"appetite\\" for the hunger fans. Did I expect to mug after reading the books, probably.<br />Alas, as mix as I tried to like it, I never really cared....
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It appears to be factual and unbiased.  For those of us who are interested, I think it is required reading.  And the majority of the proceeds are going to charity.<br /><br />In my opinion, the efforts to suppress the book are purely political.  The author gives credit to the President for making the call to go forward with this raid.  Some other opinions, perhaps four sentences in total, are not flattering of the current administration.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is great. It's one of those addicting jump and run arcade games. The character is cute. I love that you can shoot acorns that will kill bad guys and fireballs.<br /><br />Such a fun game. I highly recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was my first Stephen King novel to read and I loved it.  I normally read sci-fi/fantasy novels but when i saw the pre-order announced in an email the synopsis got me and I knew I'd wind up reading it eventually.<br /><br />If it says anything, I read from about the half way point to 90% done in one night/morning it kept me so enthralled.  I'm not quite finished with it, but I'm at 94% according to my Kindle; close enough to done to give a review I think!  Hopefully at this point I've written enough for Amazon to be happy, I just really want to add my 5 stars.
B0092MIHSY|5.0|I'll start off by saying that i'm a pretty big fan of Jens.  His albums previous to this one seemed to have 2 or 3 gems in it surrounded by somewhat ok songs, but nothing was cohesive.  This album was very well thought out and put together IMO.  Again, at least 3 gems, but this time the other sounds are quite good and I don't feel the need to skip them to get to my favorites.  I am recommending this album to people.  It captures his wit through his lyrics and his ability to make catchy melodic music in the process.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I enjoyed reading Slammed. It held my attention throughout the entire story. I would suggest this book to anyone who likes to read romance novels.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book is written by both characters, each taking a turn/chapter to tell the story and it was fascinating and gave me knots in my stomach while I read it! I am always curious about authors who write this way, would love an inside peek into their minds! I highly recommend this book!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I finished WHERE'S MY WATER? and moved on to WHERE'S MY PERRY?  Fun, can be challenging, a great time waster.  Don't play before going to bed.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I received this DVD in good condition and it played very well.  This is a great movie!  It has a lot of action and Tom Cruise, as usual, does a great job on his stunts.  Thank you!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book.  Very well written and very descriptive.  It was very exciting to read and it was nice to get a first hand overview of what really happened.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I found this video enjoyable. It depends on what you are looking for in a plot. This movie in my opinion is about uniting cultures and within each culture their is division even amongst themself. It is ot a film that's over the top, just light and enjoyable for a rainy weekend.
B008D28HYS|4.0|This puzzle makes you really think on what is the next move and keeps your mind working. This is an exciting game.

B008CP93S0|5.0|Awesome movie..I thought it was so funny. If you like a movie that's funny and u don't really have to think..just watch and enjoy and laugh? This is the movie for you..  great actors too!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is totally unexpected.  A great read, and worth both the time and the money. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to all.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This game is great to come home to at the end of a hectic day because it does not require too many brain cells, but there is a certain satisfaction when you complete a game!

B002N5N5LG|5.0|Jeff Winger is a hotshot lawyer whose career has been brought to a screeching halt due to the slight problem of his qualifications being non-existent. He has to attend Greendale Community College for four years and pass a series of tests to regain his law credentials. An attempt to seduce a fellow student, Britta, by inviting her to a fictitious study group spirals out of control, resulting in the creation of a real study group. As the group goes through the school year, they learn and grow together. And also inadvertently create a copyright-infringing school anthem, give the college a guy in a gimp suit as its mascot and then almost destroy the place in a titanic paintball game that goes horrendously awry.<br /><br />Community is entering its fourth season in the USA, but may be one of the best-kept secrets on television. Airing to mediocre ratings in the States and having almost no profile at all in the UK, it's nevertheless a funny, confident show which acts as both an obvious comedy and also something of a commentary on social dynamics and pop culture. The 'community' of the title is a reference to the central characters, who are all outcasts of one type of another, and their bonding together, and also to the wider college around them, personified through a recurring cast of tutors and other students.<br /><br />Early episodes are mostly spent with the show trying to avoid cliches, with the character of Abed (Danny Pudi) always ready to compare an episode's storyline to something he saw on Friends or M*A*S*H*. This constant meta-commentary and attempts at ironic post-post-modernism are amusing but also slightly tiresome, with the show occasionally feeling a little smug with itself or else flailing at trying not to be caught between cliches. However, it's not long before the writers stop caring about that (at least quite so much) and instead concentrate on having fun. Community melds both the characters and the situations they encounter into compelling storylinesthat feel a lot longer than their modest 22 minutes-per-episode run times would suggest.<br /><br />The actors are all excellent in their roles, particularly Joel McHale as Jeff, who has to make an inherently unlikable character likable without weakening the character, which he just about manages to do. The aforementioned Pudi is also great at portraying a character who initially appears to be the most predictable of the group but rapidly develops some interesting depths. Donald Glover takes the initially dull character of Troy and rapidly (by the end of episode two and its iconic Spanish rap number) turns him into a highlight of the show, thanks to some great comic timing. Yvette Nicole Brown's Shirley initially appears to be the 'mother' figure of the show, but some revelations about her personal life and gossipping tendencies turn that on its head. There's also a glorious cynicism about the character of Pearce (played by Chevy Chase, enjoying a career resurgence), a casually sexist and racist old man whose role in the group appears to primarily be making the other characters feel good about themselves. Alison Brie and Gillian Jacobs round off the primary cast as Annie and Britta, who initially both seem fairly straightforward characters before gaining more layers as the season progresses.<br /><br />Slightly less successful are the supporting characters, most notably Ken Jeong as 'Senor' Chang whose character is rather broad (more effectively in some episodes than others) and Jim Rash as the Dean, who random weirdness (he has a sexual predilection for people in dalmatian costumes) is wearying. Still, both have their strong moments as the season progresses.<br /><br />After the first few, slightly more pedestrian episodes, the season takes an upward turn in quality, culminating in the now-legendary paintball episode, Modern Warfare, when the show's ingredients combine together to create something hilarious, mildly emotional and completely demented, leaving the viewer eager to see what the writers and cast can do in the second year.<br /><br />Season 1 of Community (****½) is well-written, sharply-acted and finely-observed, with more going on under the hood than you might expect from a situation comedy.
0142000671|4.0|I am not into reading books much but I had to purchase this for a project for school. As i started reading I had gotten into it more each page that I read. I like this book and the price was right. If you are looking to get it don't hesitate buy it. This is coming from a guy that doesn't enjoy reading books.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Let me start off by saying I have no military background whatsoever. Those who do will understand this book better because the terminology will be more clearly understood. I found myself skimming over the military weapons terms and training explanations because I just couldn't visualize them.<br />However, I did thoroughly enjoy reading this book. My eyes were opened to what actually happened in the discovery of Osama and his death. The media, probably at the persuasion of the government, did not let us know it all. I would like to have learned more about the disposal of Osama's body, but I know this author had nothing to do with it so he couldn't write about which he had no knowledge.<br />I did come to a better respect for the Navy SEALS after learning of their intense training and sacrifice to their families.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book nicely ties together the science and practical application of the Paleolithic diet into an easy to read, highly informative book.  The guidelines are specific and backed up by sound logic.  If anyone is starting out with a Paleo diet, or struggling with maintaining it, this is a great book to motivate you to stick with it.
B0071BY084|5.0|I have had this for months- I just popped it in yesterday for the first time and I have been stunned ever since.<br /><br />Joe and I go way back. I remember when I was 16- I saw Joe on MTV in his video for Big Bad Moon. I lost my mind. I had this piece of crap Peavey Gremlin guitar- and I was inspired to play.<br /><br />I have followed Joe religiously ever since- I have everything he has done and have memorized every note and nuance of every one. I have been fortunate enough to catch him live 3 times- including front row pit for the Professor S tour.<br /><br />I read the \\"worst\\" revew and wanted to chime in. \\"The same songs\\" was the theme of that ill conceived post.  I really don't get it- last time I checked it is 2012 and you know the songs on the release before you buy it- it's not some marketing suprise, it's not the box of cereal that says \\"New and improved\\" and you open it and can't tell a difference.<br /><br />I take issue with the complaint as well as it is not based in fact.<br />\\"The same songs\\"<br />There are 10 songs from the new album on this one- 10. They obviously aren't \\"the same songs\\"<br />Hordes and Memories are old songs that you can't find in any recent live release since his 1988 EP.<br />War has never been featured on his live releases and Big Bad Moon and Crystal Planet not since Live in San Fran 2001. That's 15 songs. 15 of 25- 60% of the live album is stuff that is NOT \\"the same songs\\"<br />How can anyone complain if an artist plays hits? Of course he's going to play staples AWYAWM, Summer Song, Ice 9, Blue Dream and Satch Boogie. They're STAPLES. What does this guy suggest in it's place? The Phone Call and The Snake among others.<br /><br />In short- as this has gone on too long. Joe is as great as ever- and as one of the most technically awesome guitarists to have ever lived- that's saying something. Even the staples have a different flair- a twist.<br /><br />I am amazed and grateful to be able to listne to another flawless live Joe release. His last album was a shining example of thinking how could an instrumental guitarist put out anything different when he has had a career over 20 years? He did- The last album is epic and my favorite. This live release showcases that album beautifully.<br /><br />Thanks JOE!release.

B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Filled with extraordinary energy and sensitivity. This book creates an India we can all finally understand, and a protagonist with a heart as big as the continent!
B00846REIS|5.0|Many said this book was too much like the Grey series. I really ejnoyed this book. Not once did I have to use the dictionary on my kindle to try and figure out what the author was talking about!
1582701709|1.0|So Im reading \\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne. And I seem to be the only one that was disgusted by the mentality of this book upon reading the first 15 pages.<br /><br />So much, that Ive decided to write a page by page analysis of what I thought of the book as I read through it. To see if my opinion of it changes as I read. Right now... Did I mention Im disgusted.. This page particularly disgusted me.. Why?<br /><br />This book states for every negative thought you have, exactly what you didn't want to happen, will happen.<br /><br />■ \\"I don't want to spill something on this outfit.\\" means \\"I want to spill something on this outfit and I want to spill more things.\\"<br /><br />■ \\"I don't want that person to be rude to me.\\" means \\"I want that person and more people to be rude to me.\\"<br /><br />■ \\"I don't want to catch the flu.\\" means \\"I want the flu and I want to catch more things.\\"<br /><br />■ \\"I don't want to argue.\\" means \\"I want more arguing\\"<br /><br />And thus a classic... According to this Author's Logic:<br /><br />■ \\"I don't want to be sexually harassed.\\" means \\"I want to be sexually harassed and more people to do it.\\"<br /><br />■ \\"I don't want to be raped.\\" Means \\"I want to be raped and I want more people to rape me.\\"<br /><br />■ \\"I dont want to have cancer.\\" Means \\"I want to have cancer\\"<br /><br />That is all in accordance to this author's logic. Right? Isnt that what she is basically saying?<br /><br />By saying that you dont want something you are saying you want the opposite to happen. This is the way how the woman who wrote this book thinks.<br /><br />I hate her very much right now. Hate is such a strong feeling to have about some one you dont know.... *Sigh*And really, the only reason Im going to keep reading is because people seem to love this book no matter the crap she implies happens to you because you attracted it to yourself.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I downloaded it while away for a 3 day weekend and finished it before I got home.  Best book I've read in a long time.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This movie was terriffic.  It didn't change a thing that all the characters in the original Star Trek used to say about things they did when they were younger.  It was great seeing what the Kobiashi Maru test was really about.  Showing us how they made some of the scenes was very interesting but for me it took some of the magic away.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Sadly I cannot give this book much of review as the first person narrative writing style was so lacking finesse in any form I could only stomach 40 pages.  In actuality I was done within the first few minutes, but having seen the movie, which was entertaining I wanted so badly to like this book and therefore kept going.  I do not want to be negative regarding the authors skills as the story is unique and probably quite engaging, but as a lover of the English language I feel compelled to defend it against those that are charged with enticing the rest of us to think, feel, hear, smell and touch the images that the proper use of English can create.  For many of you it might be enough to read an easily digestible book, but for my part I want my authors to be better writers than I am, and that is not a high bar.
B008KMHFJY|2.0|originally reviewed here: [...]<br /><br />I thought it got off to a rough start, the writing was a bit disjointed and rather jumpy to begin with and I almost gave up on it, but it did settle down enough that I wasn't completely frustrated by it.<br /><br />The story was okay, however I was very distracted by the constant to and fro-ing between Abby and Travis and wondered if I should take a Prozac to settle my nerves; it seriously was a train wreck relationship.<br />But I have to confess, some of it was rather appealing, Travis did try to woo Abby after all.<br />At one time or another, I think we've all had, or wanted to have, someone to be so in love with us that they literally cant survive without us; a true co-dependent existence. But that kind of relationship is often destructive and unhealthy, and there were moments in this book that it went too far.<br />I lived with a boyfriend for a year in my late teens and suffered both mental and physical abuse before I finally left, and Abby and Travis's relationship was very reminiscent of that time for me. Travis never actually hits Abby, but at the end of the day, it's sometimes the emotional bruises that are far harder to heal.<br /><br />I didn't particularly like Abby all that much to be honest, I just found her to be a bit stuck up and standoffish. Travis wasn't much better either. In fact, I had problems with all the characters. They were all a very mismatched, shallow bunch of people that annoyed me.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under the age of 18 and even though I thought their relationship was abusive (depending on your definition) it is something that happens, and therefore I'm not going to condemn the author for it. But I am a little disappointed that this kind of behavior was romanticized, which may lead a younger reader to think that this kind of relationship is healthy and okay; and its not (IMO)<br /><br />An okay read, but definitely not for everyone.<br />Just a 2 Star read : <br /><br />*note*<br /><br />Walking Disaster (Beautiful #2) is the same story but written from Travis's POV and is set for a release date in April 2013.<br />If you visit the author's website you can read an excerpt, and I must say I actually liked what I read more than I did Abby's POV.me story but written from Travis's POV and is set for a release date in April 2013.  If you visit the author's website you can read an excerpt, and I must say I actually liked what I read more than I did Abby's POV.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|This is one of those movies that you don't hear a lot about, keeps you interested.  Fi you are looking for a good story-line on the human condition this is it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A truely great love story.  Started out a bit twisted, there were unexpected twists and turns, but a great love story none the less.  I would really like to see a fourth book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Just couldn't put it down. This book documents the hard work, dedication, and intense patriotism these soldiers posess.  Very intimate and authentic.  Written in a style that makes the characters very true to life.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the game is addictive.... I play this nearly every day. that's how fun it is.... gives you something to do when yur bored
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Jeff Davis did this show well. Season 2 better than first. Great humor,  action, suspense,  and beautiful ladies on show. Great acting. Season 3 will be even better
B005I0DLXK|4.0|Similar to her previous albums, she delivers a mix of R&B, pop, and dance music. Music for just about every mood you can feel.
B00846REIS|4.0|Tantalizing and raw.  Just what I needed as a new phase of life starts.  Read 50 Shades of Grey first which got me interested in reading more books like this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third and final book in the Hunger Games series is a wonderful completion to the story of the principle characters started in the original novel.  When I first started to read the original novel I did so on the recommendation of a friend and didn't believe I would enjoy reading about kids killing kids!  I was wrong!  The killing in the books is not the main theme of the book, instead the development of the characters and their feeling for each other is what you remember.  I highly endorse the three book Hunger Games series to anyone who enjoy a little suspense.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|If you liked the red queen and the white queen you will like Kingsmakers Daughter. It makes you think of the sacrifices a very public figure must make to get to where they are and to stay there. A good engrossing read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book in the Hunger Games series continues the excellent writing in the original novel.  Suzanne Collins is a wonderful writer and keep you interested from front cover to the credits.  Highly recommend!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved the British acting along with elements of the \\"classes\\" in the British 1900's.  How they interacted with each other, the interdependence they had and the historical evolvement of events was superbly accomplished.  Have both Seasons 1 & 2, can't wait until the 3rd Season begins in January 2013.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very well written and gripping  book. I had a tough time putting it down for a break. I didn't know the how it was going to end until the book was almost finished. The ending was very different is all I can say without giving anything away! I Really enjoyed the book!
B00846REIS|4.0|Although I liked this book, I think I would have gotten into it more. It was so similar to Fifty Shades.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I started with the \\"Secret\\" by Rhonda, then the \\"Power\\" and now \\"Magic\\".  I can't say enough about these books, they are wonderful, uplifting, confidence builder, etc.  Money well spent.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Love him or hate him, Hitchens was a talented man. He was an amazing person. He was one of my favorite writers and personalitites, along with Gore Vidal. With the loss of both men, the world is less humorous. I followed Hitchens final days on earth via his Vanity Fair articles, which is the book Mortality. I admired his courage and fight in his battle against cancer, and will miss him. In the book he never rages against his misfortune. He fully intended to continue his fight, even though the medical procedures he went through were horrendous. He was a unique human being.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It's an account of the mission as well as the training leading up to it. A good fast read just giving me the facts. That's what I was looking for.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I believe it is getting harder and harder to find books with great writing.  This book is one of those wonderful stories that ranks up there with the classics.  You can tell that Yann Martel had done his homework and was fully entrenched into the character.  I highly recommend this book.  It is a great read.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|While this is a very well written book, it is difficut to stay interested in it. Every chapter is a short story with all new characters and in no way connected with any other story. Some of the stories are better than others but any could be left out and it wouldn't effect the book at all. The book should be listed as a collection of short stories.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It is unsettling to see how manipulative and controlling humans can become.  I especially was unhappy about the ending. Her exploits while being \\"gone\\" seemed unlikely, as well as the fact that the two that robbed her money did not come forth once she returned home. The whole story left me scratching my head.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A very uplifting book.  A tribute to the human spirit while taking  a peek at its frailties.  This reminded me of \\"The Diary of Ann Frank\\" from \\"the German\\" perspective.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book came recommended by someone whose opinions I trust. Everything was fine until Amy came home and then it lost me. Like author didn't know how to end it.
B00979OL5A|5.0|This game is exactly the same from the original. The only difference is the new graphics. Only can play the first two levels for free, then you have to pay. Wish there was a way to earn coins to purchase more levels.
B0058YPLA2|3.0|Personally, I am completely over the myriad of crime drama franchises and supposed \\"reality\\" shows, so Once Upon A Time has been a welcome addition to my TV viewing. This is not among the greatest shows in the history of TV, the special effects won't win awards, two of the lead characters are rather vanilla and predictable, and the writers have some tweaking to do as they roll into season 2. However, the show has some redeeming qualities:<br /><br />--For those of us who grew up on fairy tales (especially the Disney versions), it's refreshing to see these stories told with a new twist and a more 21st century take. For example, we're actually given a more meaty reason as to why the Evil Queen hates Snow White, instead of the standard having-to-be-the-fairest-one-of-all nonsense.<br /><br />--Lana Parilla's Evil Queen/Regina Mills is constantly driven, relentlessly selfish and a vicious individual--and yet she creates moments where you actually feel for her (at least a little bit).<br /><br />--Robert Carlyle's Rumpelstiltskin/Mr. Gold is manipulative, sneaky, and almost always out for himself--and he somehow makes you like him as he's plotting and pulling all those strings.<br /><br />There are other positives, but to delve much further would reveal too much of the show for those who've yet to see it. Suffice it to say that, yes, Once Upon A Time is admittedly not the best show on TV. BUT, for what it is, it's a splendid change of pace and a welcome reprieve from the crime-laden, voyeur-rich, lowest common denominator fare that currently dominates television.
B00846REIS|3.0|I expected this book/series would be similar to Fifty Shades of Grey, and it was. This isn't to say it wasn't an entertaining, readable book.....just not real original. I did wonder a few times if there was going to be a story line, seemed like all the main characters did was have sex, anywhere and everywhere. That being said, I did finish the book and will probably buy the next one in the series when it comes out so I have something to read this winter that doesn't take a whole lot of thought!
B005HJWWW8|3.0|Not much better than my Fiio E-3.  Maybe it's my hearing that is the problem.I would not  buy this product again.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Once again Reacher is magnificent and Lee Child's humour very appealing.  The car ride equalled any car chase. What colour is Reacher's toothbrush?
B005TBWN0K|5.0|really cool app. I like every thing about it. its connected to evernote (which I have) so I can upload it there anytime no Internet required super app!!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love making awesome floated and then you can put them on facebook. Its so cool and its for and awesome price I love it solo much it is just so cool you have to get it I spend hours on iit!!!!!!!!!!!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|While heavy on the action and CGI graphics, I found little that was compelling about the movie. Their was little - if any - real character development, and in the end I did not really care if the heroes won or lost, or lived or died. The dialogue was too contrived and there were far too many cliches.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|didn't know it was a game that I needed friends to play. Will see how far I can go without having to play online
B005KB0SU6|5.0|This Spanish language book is beautifully and artfully written, a moving and powerful story told in a manner that captivated the reader from start to finish and left him wanting more! Much More!<br />Keep stocking these books.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|what we have come to expect from Ken Follett! A great read, I could not put it down. I highly recommend this book
B008BIN9EW|4.0|I purchased this game to have something to play with my husband. It misses the mark in two areas. 1- It would be nice to have real time play if your partner is next to you. (perhaps a way to use the same device to play.) 2- It needs a dummy course for people like me. I have already played a game and I am still fairly clueless. Both of these things would be above and beyond the cost of this game. It is worth what you pay for.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addicting game.  I was not sure about this game when I first started playing, it just seemed too easy.  The more I played the more addicted I became.  I love it.  I have had the game less then a week, and have almost completed 5 levels.
B00846REIS|4.0|Another \\"sexy\\" story!  A page turning can't put down type of book! Along the lines of Fifty Shades. Rated R
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I have been playing for 3 months and haven't spent a dime.  Very addictive!!  hard to figure out how to get out,  do so by going to settings.
B000GOZOP6|5.0|THIS IS A MUST SEE, AWESOME MOVIE!!  I LOVE IT!<br />THIS IS A MUST SEE, AWESOME MOVIE!!  I LOVE IT!
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Fifty freed author must be laughing all the way to the bank. Nothing of interest ever happens in the book and once one is past the first or second sex scene, it all becomes bland and horrifically boring. But! perhaps if your sex life needs perking up, you might like this book.
B003U74NQW|2.0|The movie was what I expected. I needed to watch it for class, but I'm never wasting my money on Amazon Video again. It froze three or four times through the movie, and the quality of the video was really bad.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! It is my new favorite thing to look at when I use my kindle fire.  I love seeing all kinds of creative ideas.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|its a fun game and all just its easy to run out of coins and want to buy more. don't let them trick u into buying coins :) over all its a fun game
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very entertaining sci fi. now some additional words to get the count to 20 blah lah so bo how now
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey series is very addicting. So easy to read on Kindle fire. A great love story filled with danger and desire.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|takes way to long to get coins and offers little in return for the long wait. little is explains although it downy take much to understand
B0015DYIH2|3.0|This whole book seemed to me like it was leading up to a climax that never happened. I was really amped to find out how the series would end and it just fell flat.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|I downloaded this on to my son's Kindle Fire, thinking that he might enjoy the video of spiders chasing bugs.  Instead I find myself trying to stop the spiders, and trying to do it in only a few cuts.  I like this game, but am disappointed that I've reached the top level (probably because I'm an adult and the target audience was kids, under 10!)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I think here in the US we wont see season 3 until early 2013 on PBS<br />I have been addicted to the show since I bought the DVD from first season. I could not wait until every sunday to watch a new episode on season 2. It brings you back to wonderful and sad times of history in a perfect settings. The performances are amazing....you are transported to the time!!!!<br />So different from new series where they just show sex drugs and violence<br />Im sure Ms Mclain will bring excellent performances and spice to it because she is a great actress<br />hope they show it soon here in the USA
B0018RFLQ2|4.0|Really enjoyed this film at times it can seem a little drawn out but all in all a good movie. Great story with decent acting.
1564148793|5.0|Jason provides great information in his book. I've read my copy several times! This guy knows his stuff and its great for people interested in protective magic.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great series. the amazon video stream feature is so cool. I actually watched it before it even arrived. The videos themselves are still unopened! I'm gonna just purchase the video stream next time. It's cheaper.
B006LSZECO|5.0|didn't love the ending but enjoyed the book... lots of strange twists and turns...I highly recommend this book... will probably seek out other stuff by this writer
0525952616|4.0|Possibly a concern for the future when the profit motive and a sense of entitled inevitability will surely outweigh a sense of morality.
B000KA7CSS|5.0|In My Opinion, The Most Entertaining NCIS Episode So Far.  The beginning, middle and especially the end, are excellent.  Also, Abby's costume is super.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Just proves that Obama still holds the record of never telling the truth! He is the only president that is completely devoid of the ability to tell the truth.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Edited. Good news the devs have fixed the tapping issue and now the game works flawlessly. As promised, upped to 5 stars. Thanks devs. I will certainly be looking out for more from Nomad.<br /><br />Original review<br />I was surprised how much I like this one. It's simple. Not too hard not too easy. Just create the sum of two blocks vertically to add up to the AWEsome number. You can move them sideways and rotate them. Match colors for extra points. I had to turn off the music as I found it annoying, but I usually turn off the music on most games.<br /><br />This is two games this week with NO permissions, and this one has no IAP, no ads. Imagine that, it can be done. Thanks NOMAD.<br /><br />The only problem I'm having on the Kindle Fire (original) is it doesn't always register my taps when I want to rotate. It's frustrating when you know where you want the block to go but can't do anything about it. When that is fixed I will up to 5 stars.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|read several books of Michael Connelly; this book is among my favorites; he shows the relevance between himself and the coyote in a city setting where you would least expect to see the lone coyote.  The symbolism was perfect as Bosch goes about trying to solve the murder. Would read this again
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|This book does a fine job of understandably and interestingly presenting current scientific findings in the field of human development during childhood, especially as related to the importance of early interpersonal relationships, which leave a lifelong imprint in multiple areas, and that are so often non-supportive or destructive.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Awesome game! If you are looking for adventure and puzzle logic this is it:) Best Big Fish game yet! You will love it!
B005LAIGKU|5.0|Get ready for this rock 'em sock 'em roller coaster ride on two tires. This is the Joseph Gordon-Levitt outing as a bike messenger supreme. I loved this film.<br /><br />There are a lot of neat elements. First time director David Koepp rivets us to our seats with the almost non-stop biking action on New York's savage streets. He did a kickass job on the action elements with some tight street level shots of the bikes in motion. It tracks, though. Unlike a lot of action films that get caught up in the action for its own sake. All the activity fits and furthers the story. Very nice use of the GPS as a tool for the messengers and also for shooting out a map for the audience to see and understand the context of the riding. Koepp has first rate screen writing credits including Jurassic Park, Spiderman and Panic Room.<br /><br />So, what about the story. It involves JGL in the role of Wilee ( as in Wiley Coyote, beep beep) three time winner of the best bike messenger award. He used to do trick riding, but now confines himself to his fixed gear single speed bike with no brakes, a true wheelman.<br /><br />His hot ex-gf, Vanessa,  played by Dania Ramirez, also delivers the goods on two wheels. Their issue though is that Wilee quit law school to ride his bike while Dania is working on the bike to get a straight job and leave bike messengering. They have split up because he blew off her school program for a bike race.<br /><br />The plot gets interesting quickly and mysteriously. Koepp here gets credit for his non-linear delivery. You have probably seen the trailer on TV which shows Wilee being chased on his bike and screaming into the phone about what was in that package.<br />Koepp fills us in with a number of flashbacks that work wonderfully for my money. They reminded me of Tarantino's use of them in Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />A very clever cop with a gambling problem played by Michael Shannon provides the dark side of the story. He wants the message the Wilee has contractedto deliver. Wilee, of course, refuses to give it up. So, we have an establishment cop for a heavy pitted against a bike messenger who wants to play by the rules.<br /><br />And the fun begins with the first of many chases.<br /><br />It's fascinating that the whole bike messenger world is an outside-the-establishment scene. The writing is so good that you don't know if this is just good-guy vs bad-guy, or really an anti-establishment story. As authoritarianism has flourished in the last few years, the idea of authority figures being evil is a logical response.<br /><br />Not incidentally, I loved the James Cameron TV series Dark Angel with Jessica Alba as a bike messenger. There is a slight reminiscence of that off the grid camaraderie here, too.<br /><br />I always liked JGL in Third Rock From the Sun also on TV.<br /><br />I recommend Premium Rush highly. It will definitely make you want to get out an ride your bike - just not through New York traffic.<br />I can't wait for the DVD. I hope it will have explanations of some of the trick bike riding.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I am a huge fan of any book that takes lots of sharp turns with the story telling so that you never know exactly how it's going to end.  Gillian Flynn does that well, so that you feel bad for the characters you want to hate, and loathe the people that you want to like.  Mostly, you have to keep reading to see exactly how it's all going to be end up instead of being a predictable read that isn't going to injure you at all.
1444737112|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read such a heart warming story of the unconditional love of an animal.  Bob & James are amazing and their story will cause you to laugh and to cry.  I highly recommend this book, once you start reading you will not be able to put it down!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I can't believe I didn't know about this sooner! I love it, I tell everyone about it!! I have in on the computer and my phone!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Not only is this a great story of the life and sacrifice of our Navy SEALs, but it is the definitive story on the mission the ended the life of Osama Bin Laden.  The narative is well written and easy to read.  There is enough detail for those looking for \\"inside\\" information, but it still provides an overview as seen by the men and women on the ground.  The politics of this book have been overstated by the media.  There is nothing too controverisal in it, other than some base line criticism of Obama and Biden for \\"outing\\" the SEAL's involvement in the mission to the media and a little jab at Biden.  The story of the actual mission is slightly different than the official version that has been fed to the public, but since the author was there, I tend to give him more credibility.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but after watching this, I just felt compelled to put in my two cents. I had been waiting for a BAD tour official dvd to come out for many years and when it was announced early in the year that the Michael Jackson Estate would release it on a dvd, I was beyond ecstatic. Then finally I received the dvd yesterday and watched it immediately. W.O.W. It certainly exceeded my expectation.  Admittedly, the quality isn't 100% perfect considering it was converted from a VHS tape of 25 years old, but the quality is still good (the Estate did a great job restoring it, which I really appreciate!) and it didn't really bother me that much because Michael Jackon is simply MAGNIFICIENT. He sings and dances perfectly and he is just breathtakingly beautiful with full of energy and you get two full hours of pure MJ with a lot of close ups and without much of crowd shots! I just couldn't take my eyes off of him the whole time watching it. I love his Dangerous tour too, but this is way better than that. It really shows why he is the greatest entertainer that ever lived and the undisputed King of Pop.
B0085776BG|3.0|While some of the action and flying scenes were good, the acting was lousy.<br /><br />Many of the action/flying scenes looked like 1950's air war movies where you could notice the pilot was in a mock-up plane in front of a screen with the background being projected onto it, except in this case they were in front of a green screen. I also don't like it when a scene is used over and over again (as in some of the battle scenes) except they flipped the scene vertically or zoomed in on a smaller aspect of the same scene. In other words it looked fake.<br /><br />The non-action scenes of the movie were almost painful. I tend to blame it on the script because I've seen some of the actors in other things and I know they can act better than this. The story line was predictable. The lines and the characters were cliche. And the actors were wooden caricatures.<br /><br />Not worth the money IMHO.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|It is a good read but there is some confusion while reading as to who is who as there are many names similar. Also the two story lines don't quite mesh...I still am not sure what one has to do with the other, but will read on....
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books deserve to be better known, and are a real triumph for independent publishing.<br /><br />The stories are engrossing, with genuine, likable (and hate-able) characters, a vividly realized future gone terribly wrong, and enough technical savvy to keep hard-SF fans happy.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|We love the movie, that's why I bought it. The only issue is that<br />the front of the box is damaged. It looks like it was cut. I buy<br />a lot of things from Amazon, and I've only ever had an issue with<br />one other thing, and it was used. This Italian Job DVD is brand new,<br />so it's disappointing that it's damaged. Hard to choose how to rate this<br />movie, because it's a 5 star, just the packaging is the issue. I've searched<br />all over Amazon, and can't seem to find any contact info. I'm still very<br />fond of Amazon, I just wish for them to give a close inspection of everything<br />before sending.
B002TUETW4|5.0|I have never been much of a Michael Jackson fan. I always appreciated the music of the Jackson Five, but never really understood Michael as a solo artist while he was alive. I decided to honor his memory on his most recent birthday and downloaded \\"This Is It\\" for play on my weekly netcast, TWRS Mid-Week Report. I was blown away by what I had missed all these years and now I am even sadder that the Prince of Pop is gone. The world tour would have been awesome and we, the world, are worse for his family's loss. His children are missing a loving, wonderful father, his siblings are missing a brother, and we are are missing a genius. This album contains all that Michael was and gives us a glimpse of what could have been. I highly recommend this album to anyone who lived the last forty years and to all our younger generations who don't fully understand who Michael was. This is worth every penny.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book was very well  written. The subject matter was something few Americans know much about, and knowing more gives us the opportunity to appreciate Seals and their training.
B002R5NL34|5.0|This is a very funny show with so many good actors and deals with a lot of current problems in modern families
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Perfect for those who like light novels, easy understanding, straightforward descriptions... It's entertaining although a bit too much a soapopera for me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|First book I read by author and could not put it down! I found a new favorite!!!She had me from the first page and kept me guessing until the very end!!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I am a big Serlock Holmes fan, and so far I am really enjoying be able to read it on my Kindle.
B009157BWU|5.0|We watched this movie for a family movie night at home with our 10 and 4 year old sons and everybody really enjoyed this movie - both boys wanted to watch it again the next day and talked a lot about \\"Oscar\\".
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day was a great read and put it into perspective just how our best in the military are in all dangerous situations.  This book also lets us know just how the one who is in the peoples white house is trying to take the overall accountability for the killing of Osama Bin Laden , which was not true. this was at the hands of our finest, the navy seals.
B0081HLM2E|4.0|Lots of twists and turns  with a surprise ending.  Loved the action but wanted to own book to clarify some of the action along the way.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Richly written - Grabs your attention from the beginning to the end.  A book you hate to put down<br />or can't wait to get back to.  Combines fiction with history - interesting but heart breaking when you read about<br />how people suffered under the European class systems.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This one of the best sites. It has endless topics to discover. I love the receipes and decorative ideas. It is like having all your magazines in one place.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|When I first started writing my book, I learned from the web site on how to publish for Kindle that the preferred format for submission was HTML.  I spent many hours learning HTML and coding every aspect of my book.  Building Your Book for Kindle only talks about using a word processing program like WORD and using its conversion function.  Now I don't know if my HTML version will be accepted.  Also, the sections on book cover and images are rather sketchy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought this was the best of the three books. Very very entertaining! It seemed to me to give the main characters more depth, and the interatctions were great.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|This was by far the best reading of all 3 books fantastic ending,only once I thought this book jumped around a little but was full of surprises. Best book I have read for a long time..... Very much a ladies book but men I think would find it interesting reading.... Enjoy
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was a great read. You don't have to read all about BUDS or all the other training, that you've read in most other Seal books.<br />I highly reccomend it.
B004L49K20|5.0|Bought this album after seeing DD in concert this summer/hearing their new songs. I LOVE it just as much as their 1st album, Rio, & Seven and the Ragged Tiger.
B006HTUZ1C|3.0|Installs with no requirements!  Then it goes down from there.  the game crashes when you flip applications.  then there's the gameplay.  you can only add two numbers and only vertically.  so even as an educational game it doesn't teach much.
B008M36EEI|4.0|Though this follows a predictable formula you won't mind that. It is a gentle fun Brit comedy in the old style of British comedies. Don't expect American style punchlines or pratfalls. Its the overall situation that will bring a smile to your face as a Yemen prince is determined to bring Salmon fishing to his country besides opposition from some of his people and skepticism from his British experts. Cinematography seemed a bit flat but otherwise no complaints. Worth the rental!
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Expect nothing because then you will be pleasantly surprised. 3.8 stars. The reason I docked points is because when movies have a surplus of characters that they jump around to, it's hard to care about them as much. And the story line becomes slightly chaotic. Like 'Valentines Day', that movie sucked. But this one did much better than that movie switching stories yet linking all the people, as well as making you care about them- at least to a degree. Heck, I must have cared because I even had a few tears at a couple parts. There were a few lol moments. Like when the daddies come on screen to 'bad a' music with their strollers and expressions. Bahahaha I laughed so hard. Other than that it was entertaining but I would not own the DVD. $3.99 was too much to rent as it was. But watch it if you are bored and looking for some entertainment.<br /><br />***May contain vague spoilers*** If you have had any experience with babies, or are close to someone that have, you will appreciate the humor. Also, they did a good job at showing different baby experiences. Kudos for that. They have the mom with the crappy experience (which I could better relate to, as I was puking for the entire pregnancy but even she had it easy in my eyes:) Then there was the race car drivers young wife who felt awesome during the pregnancy and literally sneezed the baby out. It's funny but true, that some people are lucky enough to have it that easy. They touched on symptoms of pregnancy, a c-section, miscarriage, and a heart felt adoption scene. Overall enjoyable if you aren't 'EXPECTING' a phenomenal movie.
B000U1Y5VY|5.0|I had the vinyl since it was released-surely one the most lyrical and enduring records ever.The CD was in great condition.
B004FPZ2G8|5.0|Jane Austin has been one of the best reads I have had the pleasure of reading, was easy to put myself into the time and place of this wonderful book
B004LROUW2|5.0|I am a huge lover of Murakami, especially Norwegian Wood and South of the Border West of the Sun. While Hardboiled wonderland is excellent it's never dragged me in in the same way. 1Q84 is a combination - it's a story with strong character development, intrigue, and magical elements that creep into the story very subtly. The best part? I get to have a Murakami book that I can read without finishing it the same day - dragging the pleasure out :)
B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie was great!  My husband and I watched it multiple times.  You will not be disappointed with this movie!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This movie is nothing short of amazing. It's intriguing, suspenseful, has a very well developed plot and very three dimensional characters, and has this way of captivating you so you're leaning forward, on the edge of your seat, hoping for- yeah, I'm not going to tell you. But I guarantee...you will be surprised. Go watch it! :)
B002KYHZLQ|2.0|Too many plot lines presented too early in the book. There are so many characters doing so much magic stuff that I made it two-thirds through the book without caring about any of them.<br /><br />Unlike Song of Ice and Fire, Wheel of Time, Dark Tower or Long Price, Malazan book one was just a chore to read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator is easy and very good to use and it is very good to have on hand<br />the buttons On the calculator are big and easy to see
159420229X|4.0|If you are looking for some memorization techniques as I was by reading this book, you may find some but they may not be much efective in real life. In the beginning of the book I found interesting and enticing points nevertheless they disappear towards the final chapter. Overall I enjoyed the book.
B00846REIS|5.0|Thought this was better than 50 Shades of Grey, I couldn't put  this one down, read this book in a day....can't wait for book #2 on October 2!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" is a sparse narrative providing in almost outline form the chronology of a Navy Seal Team Six member who was one of three who shot & killed UBL.  The writing borders on day notes with detail in only some passages.  It is nonetheless good insight into the frequency of Seal team missions, the UBL mission particulars, and, thankfully, reveals no classified information or other Seal's identities.  If you have read Howard Wasdin's Memoirs of an Elite Navy Seal Sniper, you'll have seen the narrative style, skills, and depth of \\"No Easy Day.\\"
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was AMAZING! It draws you in and you never want to stop reading! You would think the format would confuse the reader but it actually added a lot more to the book. I honestly enjoyed every minute of this book. Great buy.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|i wanted this movie for my granddaughter. She dances and the older girls and the younger girls were doing the sister dance and i wanted her to see and enjoy the dance. she loved it. we did edit parts of the movie and she danced through out the movie. she is eight years old.
B0087HT36U|4.0|My kids and I enjoy this game, which has a few quirks and glitches. It's a simple touch and hurl game. Invaders have taken sweet, peaceful peasants captive, so you have to break through their wood, stone, metal, earth, bamboo, lava rock, and maybe other material for their platforms to crush their assault. Many of the levels are easy for me but challenging for the kids. Some levels are impossible.<br /><br />We play on a Kindle Fire. The game has crashed a few times, once even rebooting the device. The gameplay is smooth enough, but occasionally glitches appear, like when you crack a long stone and all disappears though you know from experience that only part of it has been chipped away.<br /><br />You can think of this as a simpler version of Angry Bird, but it has its own charm. The peasants, for example, are very cute. My only real frustration with this is a treasure level that can't be solved without the buster bomb. Maybe that's a device-specific problem.
B005P68PCY|5.0|i love supernatural. i want to see the 7th season so bad before the 8th season comes out. is it on some web site in it's entirety for free?...Ramona Bruce...ashtonangelbaby19@yahoo.com
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I have not come to the ending yet! I will in the next day or so! A real page turner. My husband read it first and loved it as well, so I decided to try it. Now it is even better because we discuss parts of the book that I have already read!  This is my first novel with the character, Detective Harry Bosch. Now I want to read them ALL!
B007JMW46U|5.0|Any one over the age of 50 should remember Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes.  All the Sherlock Holmes movies were in black and white, and they always took place in the streets of London.  A very gloomy scenario.<br /><br />Who can forget his arc enemy Dr. Moriaty.  My reading this edition of \\"The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes\\" was a refresher course.  Now you might say well they have Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes, and his rendention was and is excellent, however wouldn't it be much better to read about \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and letting you imagination paint the picture for you.<br /><br />All those folks who like to form the scenes in their heads read this book I assure you; you will not be disappointed.
B0086700CM|1.0|tilting sucks I hats it for that but other than that it is preety good people read this or else
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Fascinating book not only about the killing of Bin Ladin but also of the skills needed by marines to carry out these types of missions-highly recommend it!
B00622B3MY|2.0|not as good as cars. But my son sometime still watches it. He watches Cars way more than he does with Cars 2 though.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I am a mother of 2- a four year old and an almost 2 year old. Both of my children love this movie. Not only do my children love it, but this is one of those movies I secretly look forward to watching as well. The animation is fantastic, but more importantly the message is as well. It's never too soon to teach your children about conservation!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was a good read. It was nice to hear a first hand account of the events of this mission and not the administration's doctored up story. I know the author broke the silence of the teams, but at least he is donated a large percentage of the proceeds to worthy causes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest has to be one of the best websites. You can find anything & everything on there. Food, crafts, home decor and much, much more. I go on to the website everyday because there is always something new! Enjoy..
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally, Pinterest on my Kindle! It works great, haven't had any issues with it at all. It works seamlessly. I like that you can drag to the left and the screen switches to a search, drag to the right and see your profile and stats.
0553582038|2.0|I was so disappointed with A Feast for Crows, where was the feast?, where were the crows? What was the word Brienne shouted? According to the reviews for A Dance With Dragons, we'll never know. Why all the new characters when we haven't finished with the the old? I was enthralled with the first three books, not so much with this one and I may not read the last (two if you want paperback). If I could ask one question it would be, \\"Really George???\\" Get new editors or learn how to finish a story. I hope the HBO series producers/directors take heed and give us something more satisfying.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|On the Kindle Fire.  I found this to be actually a really fun game.  I would recommend it to anyone wanting to brush up on their math skills in an enjoyable way.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|It was great, ill be picking up the next book soon. (: I was able to guess some of the plot ahead of time but it was written well enough that I didnt mind.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Hooked since the first episode of season one and not disappointed with the second season! Full of surprises and twists!
B005GHN2GG|5.0|Very original story with wonderful characters who have interesting lives. Martise is a slave owned by the Conclave, a group of wizards. She is sent to spy of the Master of Crows to determine if he is corrupted by an evil god. Very interesting plot and kept me reading well into the night. I loved the characters and believe the book would have been even better if it were longer and there was some further background development. But, it leaves this possibility open in sequels or even prequels. It is a keeper.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|enjoying this game on my new kindle fire hd. only on 7x7 boards so far. can see it getting more difficult.
B004MMEF30|5.0|[[ASIN:B004MMEF30 Hound of the Baskervilles]]<br /><br />I loved this book. It was interesting, exciting, and challenging. I love books with big vocabulary because I can use those words in vocabulary. What I liked the most is how cheap it is, $0.99 amazing!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book is a page turner.  However, found it to be too disturbing for my taste.  Did not care for the ending at all!
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|...it is a nice little escape from the day to day.  I read chapter one at the book store.  The next night, at about 10 pm, while my hubby watched storage wars, my mind was drifting to the characters.  I ended up giving in and purchasing it on kindle. By 3 in the morning, I had devoured the whole book.  This was a few weeks ago, so when amazon asked me to review the novel today, I had to really search my memory to recall what the story was about.  Which I think says something about the story.  Not very memorable, yet when I was inside of it I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />However, I do remember the male lead being a controlling, hot tempered little bugger and I felt at times the heroine was a tiny bit wishy-washy considering her tough past.  Despite this, I still wanted to find out where these two crazy kids ended up.  I believe the author did well to keep the pace going.<br /><br />So its my opinion that you would enjoy this novel if you aren't too much of a book snob, and don't mind reading about roller-coaster ride relationships.
B0090EIILU|3.0|Not a movie I would purposely watch again although, there were a few giggles. 1-1/2 hours lost that can never be returned.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Saw the movie and read the book... actually, read the book first, saw the movie second.  I prefer the book over the movie BUT they both work.  I'm a huge Nicholas Sparks fan... I read and watch it all.  :)
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm not much of a reader but was talked into trying Fify Shades and boy I couldn't put the book down. If you love sexy romance this is the book to read.
B00932A2MC|3.0|The special effects were good...however, the story itself was pretty plain.  No real plot line, nothing cohesive or new, simply a handful of rehashed story concepts smashed together with some good effects to hold your attention.  There were even portions in the movie that to me (a sci-fi fan) didn't make sense.  Aliens travel the galaxy to dominate earth...and their spacecraft has to \\"hop\\" around the ocean?  Yeah...kind of a leap. ;P
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|This is suppose to be a new society type film, the haves and have not's. sort of a running man type movie. I fell asleep twice watching it.
B006HTUZ1C|3.0|I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by this creative take on my favorite arcade style of puzzle fusion game. While the interface, graphics and sound are relatively simple, they function well, and do nothing to take away from the game's appeal. Really the only criticism I have is that I'd like to see this idea developed further. The biggest flaw in the game in my opinion is that there is only one operation (addition) that can only be applied in one direction (vertically) and can only use two cubes. How about a multiplication round? Or better yet, what if different directions (vertical, horizontal, diagonal) performed different operations? What if the player could control which directions could perform which operations? What about rounds where 3, or 4 numbers must be processed? This game has so much untapped potential that I must admit I was a bit disappointed by the lack of options. Still a good game, but it could be truly AWESUM if it were fully fleshed out.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|So, I'm pretty sure I can't say anything about this movie that no one else has said already, so I'm just going to review the special features, and overall layout of the Blu-Ray. This was the first Blu-Ray disc we have bought (buying it alongside our Blu-Ray player) and I have to say, it was worth it. You could tell the graphics were clearer, and it was overall a better experience than the DVD. Also, we bought it at Wal-Mart and received a Mockingjay necklace alongside it (always good to package a collector's item with your merchandise).<br /><br />Now, onto the special features. I liked the behind the scenes feature, which included a little explanation on some things that were left out of the book to movie transition. There is also a propaganda short from The Capitol (shown in the movie itself) which is interesting to watch as a stand alone piece, rather than just a clip from the movie. Next, there is some promotional artwork that you can scroll through in a gallery (though pressing the next arrow does get tedious after a while), but if you like looking at the posters of various characters that you might not have seen before, this is for you.<br /><br />Our Blu-Ray also came with a digital copy, which I hooked up to iTunes. This is a little more scattered with it's special features, but offers info on all of The Tributes, and it gives you clips of most of their scenes from the movie. It also has a small sample of info on each district, and the Capitol. Plus, if you use the digital code, you can play it on your iPod, which is good for people on the go.<br /><br />The only drawbacks were two things. One is there is no movie commentary, which I was really looking forward too, but there is a sort of condensed version in the behind the scenes feature. Second, is there are no deleted scenes, which surprised me, as usually, most movies come with scenes that were cut from the film. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers I guess.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the film (being a fanof the books before), and for what the Blu-Ray costs, with the high quality and bonus material) I'd definatly recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so far I am enjoying the game.  energy runs out too quick though &amp; to keep playing you have to buy more.  hopefully you will be able to get more energy as the levels go up.
B005ZUR724|4.0|good game. warning! have a good stable connection when using rwc! will charge you and receive nothing due to timeout.
B0047747A6|5.0|IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. i FELT AS IF MICHAEL WAS TALKING TO ME THE WHOLE TIME. AND NO MY CAPS IS NOT LOVED I LOVED IT A LOOOOTTTTTTT ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B006LSZECO|1.0|This story was slow to start.  Almost set it aside many times.  Plot absolutely ridiculous.  If she planned her  wickedness she wouldn't have been so naive to be taken advantage of by the people in the cabin area.  The ending totally unsatisfactory.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Interesting story of one woman's journey hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.  Descriptions of the trail, and her personal changes along the way, are quite vivid.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Love palying this game on my tablet. It can be fun playing by yourself against the computer, but it makes more fun with the two player mode. You can spend hours having a blast with this.
1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson has done a remarkable job on a remarkable man, Steve Jobs.  Steve was a very intense personality from the beginning.  The candid interviews and Jobs own decision not restrict or even influence what was written about him brings raw insight to the man.  I have never read a more fascinating biography about a truly complicated personality. We were fortunate to have such a great visionary-flawed-human being among us. I am grateful we have his story.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This an excellent read, I absolutely recommend it! I have 24 years of miltary experience, it does not contain anything remotely classified. The politicians and the pentagon need to get off this patriot's back.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|The amazon music app is exactly what I was expecting pertaining to retrieving the music that I would like to listen and considering purchasing. I haven't really had any complaints about it and since I mainly have android devices I'm digging the cloud player that I can use for my purchases as well as the current content that is featured on each of my android devices.
B0083EW97W|5.0|I began listening to John Mayer starting with Room for Squares and have enjoyed each album as much as the last. This one is no different. Every song stands on it's own merit. My favorite from the album is Walt Grace's Submarine Test. It tells a vivid story like no other song I have come across in the last few years.
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|this is only a one level demo. Looks nice on Fire, but the controls are awkward. the screen is horizontal and the steering controls are simply arrows on the sides of the screen. it is hard to tap the break petal and there is an arrow on the cart (I'm guessing a speed boost) that you cant reach while steering. I like that I could try it first, because I don't think I would buy the full version.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did. Good character development and even though the ending was wrapped up neatly, it wasn't totally predictable. Good book for book club discussion.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|Kiss of Steel was an unexpected gem of a book with fantastic characters, good action, and hotness hotness hotness! This books gets an easy five stars from me and leaves me waiting on the edge of my seat for book two!<br /><br />McMaster created a world where the aristocracy has vampire blood flowing through their veins and the cruel reign supreme. The rich and powerful willingly take on vampire blood to become 'blue bloods', meaning that they are stronger, faster, and live longer but one day they will begin turning into full fledged vampires and will have to be killed. They must drink human blood to survive, but have to watch for signs that the vampirism is taking over. This spilt into two different kinds of vampires was intriguing and I really loved it.<br /><br />This paranormal steampunk romance (light on the steampunk, heavy on the romance) is told from the alternating points of view of Honoria and Blade. Honoria is the daughter of a scientist who was experimenting with blue bloods and vampirism to find a cure when he was unexpectedly murdered. Honoria, who was always interested in her father's work and even worked alongside him for a bit, is a knowledgeable and likable heroine. She is smart and witty, but also very loyal to her family. She is the sole caregiver for her younger sister, Lena, and her brother, Charlie, who has a dangerous illness.<br /><br />Quote:<br />He smiled and her breath caught. Such a wicked, devilish smile. If she had been a normal young woman, without the heavy burden she carried, she might have let her gaze linger. Or if he had been a man instead of a monster.<br /><br />Blade is the rough and tumble ruler of Whitechapel, the poor district where the destitute and dangerous live. Honria finds herself living in Whitechapel after her father's death and eventually her path crosses with Blade's. They strike a deal that benefits them both, but Blade secretly just wants to keep Honoria close. Honoria is afraid of Blade because he is a blue blood and she knows he must drink blood to survive. She also knows that she has responsibilities at home and a secret to keep about her brother and she can't just give in to Blade.<br /><br />Quote:<br />Her gaze flickered his way. \\"You're staring.\\"<br />\\"Can't 'elp meself,\\" he replied. \\"You were made to be stared at.\\"<br /><br />Blade is that sexy Alpha male we all dream about and McMaster didn't hold back when creating him. His immediate attraction to Honoria and determination to have her no matter what coupled with his kindness and generosity toward her make him completely impossible to resist.<br /><br />Honoria and Blade are amazingly well written. They both have so many sides and secrets. Their building relationship was a wild ride to read, from distrust to faith to attraction to love. There was a great balance between seduction and sweetness between these two that I really appreciated. And then there was the hotness. Goodness, McMaster threw in all the stops with these two and I was practically drooling during some of the scenes. This one will keep you up late reading, that's for sure!<br /><br />Quote:<br />\\"Honoria. Look at me.\\"<br />To look at him would undo her. She slipped her shoes off and crossed toward him, her stockinged feet sinking into the thick carpets. To have his mouth on her skin.....She shook the thought off with a shiver. Such an intimacy had never occurred to her. A hot little flush swept through her lower belly.<br /><br />There are a lot of twists and turns in this book, some you might see coming and some that will certainly surprise you. The action scenes mostly center on the hunt for a rogue vampire that is on the loose in the city and McMaster proved that she can handle the action as well as the bedroom. One of the only complaints is that I wanted to see more of our main 'bad guy', Vickers. Both Honoria and Blade each have their own fights to pick with Vickers and when we finally meet him he is all the evil that was promised. He is that slimy and power hungry bad guy on a constant ego trip and I found myself waiting for a big showdown where he'd finally be put in his place.<br /><br />I don't know what I can say to make you read this book, but whatever it is let's just pretend I said it! This will be in my top ten favorite reads this year for sure. It really had everything I usually look for: action, strong heroines, sexy Alpha, mysteries to solve, creepy bad guy, and hot sex! Can you really go wrong here? Look for book two in the spring, which will focus on Honoria's sister and Blade's second in command (a werewolf!) as well as continue Honoria and Blade's story.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of: well-written paranormal romance, vampires, plots with mysteries and twists, sexy sexy sexy men, Firelight and Moonglow by Kristen Callihan, and everyone who wanted more sexy times in God Save the Queen by Kate Locke.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this classic. I had never read it before. Getting through the pirate talk was challenging at times, I must say. Overall, an exciting page-turner!
B002O1TMI4|5.0|This one's got it all, classical, great bass, and piano. Add Matt's guitar riffs and I'm in all the way. Message and lyrics, this one's a keeper and political at another level. ...Liked many of the tunes anyway after seeing his live in Seattle concert. Great gig- wish it was an mp3 file and could compare to the album version. Might even be better. Buy it- you'll like it.
B0085KGHOK|5.0|this review is for the Blu-ray of this concert only. i'm probably not as big of a Slipknot fan as other people out there, but i picked up this disc after finding it in the store and am very pleased at how great of a job the producers did putting this together. the video is full 1080p high definition, and the audio quality is just as great featuring both a DTS-HD Multi channel track as well as a high resolution LPCM Stereo (uncompressed audio) track as well. special features included in this release is a 45 minute documentary and music videos from the album All Hope Is Gone. i'm very pleased with this release and would recommend it to anyone considering purchasing this.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was a great read.  Blake Crouch hits it out of the ball park again.  If you are a horror fan, this is for you.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thought the book was very interesting.  I had a hard time putting it down to go to work!  My son deployed to Afghanistan early hours the Monday morning after Bin Laden was killed.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It seems easy enough touch the screen and kill zombies... I love killing Zombies!! hehe the only thing I haven't figured out is the upgrades you gather coins  & power up as you go along and it suggests how to spend them (which I haven't done yet) I like play the game more and see if they might be better spent later on something more useful. I'm not that far into the game but it had been fun so far and I can see it becoming a lot more challenging... Good graphics
B008D28HYS|5.0|Great game and a great step up from the original CrossMe. There have been the times where I get really stumped and have to put the game down and come back with fresh eyes but that's the sign of something really good. I highly recommend this one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK....KEPT MY INTEREST THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH. YOU DEFINITLY WANT TO READ THIS IS YOU READ HUNGER GAMES!
B008HI7BMW|4.0|I enjoy this soundtrack for a different reason than the Dark Knight. The Dark Knight Rises continues with many of the themes found in the other Zimmer-based Batman soundtracks and focuses more on the darker side of the music, probably to focus on the thematic elements in the movie. The album is filled with some of the recurring Batman themes driven by your strings (bass, cello) and heavy percussion, typical of Zimmer-style music. He throws in some of the chanting elements from the movie as well as use of electronics, which adds to the raciness of the music and I love it.<br /><br />I would agree with other commenters that the music does not seem to have the same level of mastering and hence the music quality suffers a bit. My only other quibble with the soundtrack is that it doesn't explore as many themes as the Dark Knight does, especially like the last minute of \\"Harvey Two-Face\\" with a beautiful, but powerful ending.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoy the soundtrack, but I am a fan of Zimmer's work, so anyone looking for music with heavy percussive tones with a focus on dark, thematic elements with some electronics will surely enjoy the music.
B005F6NA5G|4.0|Overall, I like this CD and the song selection. Originally, I purchased it after hearing one of the songs (Tequila) on the radio. It appears that the radio version (superior) and the CD version of this song are different. The salute \\"tequila!!!\\" has been replaced on the CD with something not quite comprehensible. This is a shame since without \\"Tequila\\" there is no \\"Tequila\\" song. The CD version only mentions \\"Tequila\\" once at the beginning of the song.<br /><br />Other than that, this CD contains remakes of some classically smooth, enjoyable music.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book and the series, have read it twice!!  Started reading the series for the third time, you truly get more with each read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app. So many things to do...so little time (because I spend it all looking at things to do!) LOL
B001NZXI5U|5.0|You can't go wrong w/ early 80's Scorpions.  This is by far one of their best!  There isn't one bad song on this album.  They're all great!
B006SAR6P8|4.0|After being blown away by the first Kill Bill i was expecting epic battles for the conclusion but these never happened. Still it's a good conclusion for the story. I gave it four stars instead of three because the excellent death of Bill.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is a great game that you would love to play for hours on hours without end!!!!! Hope they add more levels soon!!!!!!
B004S5C43E|5.0|From the time I received the book I started reading and I was so engrossed with it  I could not put it down.<br />It is another example of the talent this author has
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is defiantly one of the best I have read in a long time! Only gave it 4 stars because of ending!!! Worth reading!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This made me laugh out loud! She's so real and so funny. As a woman and as a working mom, I can relate to many of her self-deprecating anecdotes!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Different...entertaining  I like all stories set in the British Isles.  I was dubious at first but I was pleasantly surprised
B006EXW2YE|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this series. I wish there were more available. The actors are great and the various situations were interesting and kind of scary<br />Thanks!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was duped again.. Not my cup of tea.  Dragged on and on and on...Beginning, middle and end, I kept waiting for a part I liked.
0385344333|3.0|I guess my review name speaks for itself.<br />I had hopes for this one, since the last installment, \\"The Affair\\", was so weak. Thought Child would be trying to redeem himself.<br />The first 2/3 of the book are okay, especially if you enjoy playing numbers games. It just goes downhill from there. This is escapist fiction, so you don't expect too much in the way of a realistic plot, but...give me a break.<br />This episode just breaks down into little more than a Marvel comic book. This is simply not Reacher anymore, just a caricature of him.<br />Lee Child gave us 14-15 really classic books, but he has obviously decided to just cash in on his unique creation.<br />Most readers realize that once a book is sold to be a movie, the author has no say in the finished product, as it seldom has much to do with the character or the plot. Grin and bear it...<br />For Lee Child to actually ENDORSE that pathetic, childish,undersized twinkie of an actor,Tom Cruise, to play Jack Reacher, a foot taller, classy, stoic and intelligent, says it all.<br />Shame on you. Just take the money and run. Don't embarrass the classic character you have created any further.

B007F7QG0Y|4.0|Besides that five-string open-G tuning everybody brings up, nine things that I learned from Keith Richards' memoir:<br /><br />1. His mother was from a family of seven daughters, and if you've ever wondered about the hardiness of Keith's constitution, you should know that most of his aunts are still alive.<br /><br />2. London streets--they used to be full of animals. Keith: \\"When I was growing up, it was heavy fog almost all winter, and if you've got two or three miles to walk to get back home, it was the dogs that led you. Suddenly old Dodger would show up with a patch on his eye, and you could basically guide your way home by that. Sometimes the fog was so thick you couldn't see a thing. And old Dodger would take you up and hand you over to some Labrador. Animals were in the street, something that's disappeared. I would have got lost and died without some help from my canine friends.\\" (The roughly 60 pages of childhood stuff is probably the book's high point. Effortlessly evocative, it reads at times like some long-lost Dickens narrative, with asylum escapees on the heath, army deserters hiding in the woods by the Thames, a dead tramp found covered in bluebottles, street bullies, even a fatal explosion at a fireworks factory.)<br /><br />3. The winter that Keith, Mick, and Brian Jones shared a flat was London's coldest since 1740. They had a pay heater--had to keep feeding it coins.<br /><br />4. Keith not only wrote the bulk of the music for most of their best songs; he often came up with the lyrical angle as well: \\"Satisfaction,\\" \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" \\"Wild Horses\\" (I could go on) are all concepts that Jagger simply--albeit brilliantly--expanded on.<br /><br />5. While Mick was fooling around with Anita Pallenberg on the set of 'Performance,' Keith had revenge sex with Marianne Faithfull (and fled through a window when Mick came home). I've thought of Mick and Keith's friendship as fairly up and down, but the best way to describe it, for thirty years now, would be simply nonexistent. Interestingly, there are more entries in the index for Mick Jagger than there are for Keith himself. (My favorite: \\"Jagger, Mick and giant inflatable c***, 12-13, 485\\").<br /><br />6. In the late '60s in the UK, if your physician registered you with National Health as a junkie, you could receive heroin pills plus an equal amount of cocaine (the idea being that the coke would counteract the opiate effect of the heroin). This was the purest heroin and the purest, May & Baker pharmaceutical cocaine. Definitely no \\"MSS\\" (Mexican shoe scrapings--Gram Parsons' term for low-grade smack).<br /><br />7. Injuries sustained: finger squashed by a dropped flagstone, earring ripped from his ear as he slept, passing out after nine days without sleep and falling headfirst into an amplifier, finger burned to the bone by stray lump of phosphorous from stage pyro, punctured lung (falling off ladder), cracked skull (falling from tree).<br /><br />8. When I was fourteen I found an old copy of 'Oui' magazine in, of all places, a deer blind in the hill country of Texas. (\\"For the man of the world\\"--yeah, that was me all right.) One of the models was a dark-haired German sunbather, who came to haunt my dreams a bit. And now, all these years later I find out her name is Uschi Obermaier, and that she haunted Keith's dreams, too. When he learned of Gram Parsons' death in '73 he was in Innsbruck; on a mad impulse he drove to Munich in the middle of the night to hunt Uschi down, although he barely knew her. He miraculously found her, woke her up, broke the news, got a single sleepy kiss for his trouble, and left.<br /><br />9. Towards the end, the book starts to simply mark time--this is his manager, this is his guitar technician, these are his neighbors in Jamaica, this is the snapping turtle Keith caught in the pond at his house in Connecticut, etc.--and it begins to sound like an acceptance speech at the Grammys. The lesson is that everybody's life eventually winds down into routine, even for an outlaw like Keith Richards. And so this is the ninth thing I learned:<br /><br />When you're cooking bangers and mash, you've got to use a cold pan, no preheating.
B005LAII9O|1.0|I couldn't make it past 30 minutes of this movie, because I knew where the inertia of this flick was headed and I decided not to waste my precious time that I'll never get back. First, this movie has no identity as tries to become too many things to various audiences that could never mesh. It tries to follow in the footsteps of \\"Traffic\\" (excellent film btw) but because it takes a huge deviation, it ends up being a mix between the \\"Real-World-MTV\\" and \\"Once Upon a Time in Mexico.\\" What really unnerved me was 1.) Blake Lively narrating a movie and 2.) the casting. For the life of me, I don't know why Travolta and Del Toro would sully their reputations by choosing to work with such hipster amateurs. These are established thespians and not merely some \\"appeal to the mindless philistine masses\\" entertainers as is Lively and her two young co-stars.<br /><br />What also phased me out, was the fact that Lively's character promulgated her fantasies upon the audience such as when justifying her tactless promiscuity, she claims that both men are really one and their opposites complete each other. With a theme as serious as the one Stone wanted to portray being obfuscated with Blake's voice, presence, and general infantile character, seriously destroyed the credibility of this flick from the beginning. And how does Stone compensate for the lack of substance? As all contemporary Hollywood flicks do, with an over-saturation of violence to shock the non-cineastes into believing the movie is actually \\"great,\\" because they saw a few explosions and gory scenes.<br /><br /> Lastly, the truly sad part is this may be Oliver Stone's swan song, or rather his \\"bridge too far.\\" This is probably where his credibility as an elite director takes a Bell Shaped curve for the worst. He had his greats, but this is either a bump in the road or the beginning of the end. I definitely would not recommend for those who are film aficionados or more appropriately \\"cineastes.\\" However, if mindless violence sans substance is your thing, then add it to your gaming collection of \\"Modern Warfare\\" and \\"Grand Theft Auto,\\" as this movie is more becoming of that crowd.
B00846REIS|4.0|So you're feeling the withdrawals from having nothing to read after 50? Read this book. As much as I loved 50, and still do, this book is better written and the relationship is stronger. There is no bdsm (sorry!) but it is truly just as good.
B00377V6IS|5.0|I've been an Opeth fan for a few years now and if someone were to ask me \\"what kinda music do they play?\\" I'd be dumbfounded because that question is impossible to answer.  Instead I would point to this excellent album and say \\"listen to it and you tell me!\\"  Blackwater Park is not their best (that honor is reserved for Still Life) but Blackwater Park is an amazing record from start to finish.<br /><br />It opens with the brutal Leper Affinity which, like many Opeth songs is a brutal death metal piece until about halfway through where it switches to a clean vocal acoustic passage.  What is really impressive about this dynamic switch (which is something you hear a lot of on this album) is that it is done quite logically, it's not sudden, it's almost as if the song is saying \\"ok, we're going to slow things down for a bit\\" so the listener isn't surprised or shocked.  As heavy as the songs are there are also some mellow sections in the opening of songs like the Drapery Falls and Dirge for November, but they again switch to brutal death metal fury past the 4 minute mark.  Then there is of course the excellent track \\"Harvest\\" which is a 6 minute \\"clean\\" song with a more conventional \\"verse chorus verse\\" song structure uncharacteristic of Opeth...which is what makes it such a good track.<br /><br />There is a lone instrumental called \\"Patterns in the Ivy\\" not much to really say about it, it's more filler than anything else, but I'm ok with it.  Then the album closes with the insanely brutal title track which will surprise you as a listener even more so than the other songs on the record.  Overall if you've yet to listen to Opeth I'd recommend starting with this record or maybe Ghost Reveries and if you dig them move onto Watershed and then Still Life (which is their best).  No matter how you look at it though Blackwater Park remains a fantastic record, one that should go down in history as a landmark record for progressive music.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was set when I was in High School - I identified with many of the themes that the author presented. That being said there were many that were completely foreign to me and seem more consistent with a teen of today. Overall I really enjoyed the book.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I loved the first season and just ordered the second. I cannot wait to watch it! I don't care what other people say, it is a great show and it so sad that today we have crap reality TV and anything with real character is considered awful. If you like Lord of the Rings AT ALL. You will love this, also it was filmed in the awe inspiring land of New Zealand, like Lord of the rings. Put it back on the air PLEASE!!<br /><br />* THERE IS A FANSITE DEVOTED TO \\"LEGEND OF THE SEEKER\\", FANS ATTEMPTING TO GET IT PUT BACK ON THE AIR, IF YOU LIKE IT PLEASE JOIN US!* Thank You

B005EGXTHG|3.0|Not as exciting a read as the first two books and was a rather tame ending. I did not like how Katniss' character developed in this book. However, I guess every story needs an ending and this provided it.
