B007SGM084|5.0|OMG! just loved these books, do believe I will have to reread this trilogy.  (Never thought I would reread a book)but these are just way to good.
B000002L9Y|4.0|The album was in good shape (except for a small crack on the jewel case-to be expected after so many years). It arrived very quickly, too.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Krugman's short text on the great recession is great. It reviews sources, trends and solutions in his usual lucid prose. It is everything you want to know about this recession. The book is also loaded with data backing up his ideas. At times, he seems to assume that the reader has a degree in economics -- but if you want to know why the 'liquidity trap' is very improtant to your life -- then read this book.

0345803485|2.0|SPOILERS CONTAINED - Please read at your own risk.<br /><br />I got this book because I am in the local BDSM community and some of my friends have been talking about it and I broke down and gave into the hype. I kind of wish I hadn't. To me, it feels like this book was written by someone who did their research on Wikepedia (as the writer has the main character Ana do), and the BDSM exchanges (of which there are few) feel forced (no pun intended). I had read a few opinion pieces that said the book wasn't that great, was fanfic, was just a stroke book for soccer moms... I have to say that I agree. This book portrays BDSM in a harsh light.<br /><br />My two biggest issues with this book is how Ana reacts to the fact Christian was 15 when he was taken under wing and brought into a BDSM relationship with an older woman (a friend of his mothers), and that he was adopted at the age of 4 from a crack 'head' mother who died and that's the reason he's into BDSM. Yes, 15 is a bit young for someone to start a BDSM relationship - most states age of consent is either 16 or 18 - so yes he was a bit young, but according to Christian he knew what he was getting into and signed a contract (similar to the one he tries to get Ana to sign). The other issue is that he's like this because his crack 'head' mother (the books are a bit more liberal with her description) died when he was 4 and he was stuck with the body for a few days and mom's pimp found them. Yes, something like that would scar a child - but it doesn't leave them emotionally distant and make them turn to BDSM as the only outlet they can find for physical/emotinal contact. I was never abused and I enjoy BDSM, many of my friends in the community are stand up citizens who just like to have a little more fun when they have sexy times.<br /><br />Let's talk about Ana and Christian. After they meet and have sex for the first time (her first time ever) they seem to have sex every 10-15 pages (which makes for a good erotic novel, but it's the only way Christian seems to know how to end anything - argument or conversation, date... ANYTHING). I have a small issue with Ana, yes she's inexperienced, but she's 22 and has never played with herself sexually, never had a boyfriend, or sex of any sort. She's kissed, and as hot as the author describes her - that seems somewhat impossible. Once she comes to Seattle and visits Christian's \\"Red Room of Pain\\" aka his personal dungeon she's terrified of the place, instead of asking what everything is and does and how it's used. It just bugs me how the author names some items that I'm familiar with and via Ana's eyes they're pieces of actual torture equipment - not something fun to use, something to broaden her sexual experiences (but I guess as someone who's never even had sex before walking into a dungeon).<br /><br />And let's talk about Christian. He is the ultimate stalker. He meets Ana by a fluke (Ana's roommate is sick and she covers for her and does the interview that was scheduled) and he's caught by her blue eyes, blushing and ever consistent lower lip biting. After she leaves, he runs a BACKGROUND CHECK on her then goes to Portland to stalk her some more. Once they meet, and start figuring out what kind of relationship they both want (it's mostly what he wants as he's the Dominate in the situation) it's kind of crazy to what extents he goes to - EVEN AFTER they agree that she won't be his sub and they will just be bf/gf. What she wears, where she works (which he buys to gain more control), what she eats and when, how and where they have sex, sometimes it even feels to me the reader he'd love to tell her when to breathe. And this is only after about 3-4 weeks of knowing each other. Yes, some Dom/sub relationships do move this fast, but they sign a contract similar to the one in the book, but when they are apart living their daily lives the Dom doesn't check in 50 times a day to make sure the sub is doing what s/he wants (unless that's something they've agreed on). Christian is very obsessive/compulsive and doesn't want Ana to leave his side. If this was my friend, I'd do a reality check on them as it seems to me this is bordering on an emotionally abusive relationship.<br /><br />And the lip biting... Gah! Ana unconsciously bites her lower lip ALL THE TIME and it's a huge turn on/distraction to Christian - of which this happens usually every 5 pages or so if they're not already having sex. And I guess that since it's a somewhat 'mainstream' erotic novel the author can't use the word penis, vagina or slang there in - it's always 'down there' or 'erection.' Naughty words can be used in erotica, they make it sexier.<br /><br />OK -- BIG SPOILERS AHEAD --<br /><br />The end of the book just makes me mad. Christian spanks Ana full force (which I will admit hurts like hell) and she doesn't use her safe word/say RED or anything to stop him, and she runs away. She leaves the apartment and relationship. BECAUSE HE SPANKED HER! Gah!!! I seriously wanted to find the author and ask if she knew anything about BDSM before she started writing these books or if it just came to her head (as I know that these books are FanFic for Twilight - I'm just glad Christian doesn't sparkle). I know a few people who would laugh at 6 (SIX!) hard spankings and ask for more... LOTS MORE.<br /><br />OVERALL... I'd say this is a good book if you're looking for sex scenes to get off to. But as an accurate description of a BDSM based relationship try something else. If you want something that's real and is an erotic novel read [[ASIN:157344720X Take Me There: Trans and Genderqueer Erotica]] it's a better erotic novel, and has actual sex - not beauty/porn sex. If you want to learn more about BDSM read [[ASIN:B007C2JPTQ The Ultimate Guide to Kink: BDSM, Role Play and the Erotic Edge]], or [[ASIN:1885535333 The Guide to Getting It On]] as they both have great descriptions on how things work.y've agreed on).

B007549YM4|4.0|This movie was very entertaining.  Yes, I agree with most that there is no backstory to the characters, and that the movie does not explain more of who dropped the bombs or who the men in the suits were... but it was still a very chilling look at what could happen after the bombs fall, and the psychological effects of being couped up in a dark fallout shelter for a long period of time.  In short, it focuses on 2 basic, carnal instincts: sex and violence.  I will stop there.<br /><br />Driving the point home was the musical score.  This was very well done.  It reminded me of the score of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later and Sunshine.  The music adds to the feelings of the people who are trapped underground.<br /><br />All in all, it was very entertaining and did the job, despite the fact there were story elements missing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so cool!!!!! I had it before but one of my siblings reset my kindle, so I had to download it again.
0062064304|5.0|Many times an Art of..... book is very disappointing.  However, The Art of District 9 is not!  I love the early conceptual drawings of what the movie was going to be and what the tech and aliens were going to look like on screen.  Watching and reading about the evolution of the designs and why the changes were made was very insightful to me as an artist/wanna-be concept artist.  This is probably the best Art Of ...film book in my collection and comes highly recommended.  After reading it, I was quick to watch the movie again with more insight and, hence, making the movie even more enjoyable.  Great book!  Great movie!
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is what I've been looking for, the dictionary that came with the kindle fire was not very User friendly and I really wanted a resource I cud go to easily, it turned out to be that and much more. The games and updates. added are so interesting it makes me enjoy this app for hrs. Thanks Farlex.
B00000DHRX|4.0|Bought this wanting the best George Michael collection out there. (Twentyfive does contain some of his Wham stuff, but also has far too much mediocre newer material - Older and Patience, and far too little from Faith and Listen Without Prejudice). I ordered the US version because it appears to contain the classics Monkey and Hard Day (from Faith) which were removed from the UK version and replaced by an old B-Side (Fantasy) and an Older remix (The Strangest Thing), plus that Mary J. Blige duet which was withheld because of what George did in that public restroom. However, even though the track listing on the back of CD accurates reflected what's published on this site, the second CD was actually identical to the UK version. Maybe the UK version has now become the universal one, which is a shame because, even with the Stevie Wonder cover included, Ladies & Gentlemen: The Best Of George Michael is definitely a weaker collection without the career-defining classics that are Monkey and Hard Day.

B000M341QO|5.0|But the seller mildog keeps emailing me to rate him, here is a hint: sale the product and don't harass the customer afterward. Great movie besides the constant filling up of my email by the seller. I saw this movie on reguler Goverment TV (censored), and found the stupid censoring of the language to kill the whole movie for me, for the language in the Departed is a character in and of itself, hense my move to delete the movie off my DVR (in the middle of watching it because of the constant censoring)and buy the dvd off of amazon.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Wow! I love British actors, and if you do too, don't miss this film. I actually went to the theater TWICE to see it. Seeing as I see at most ONE film a year, that is saying a lot.<br />The writing is superb, as is the acting. I did not know exactly how it was going to turn out, and that was its charm.<br />Dame Maggie and Dame Judi are wonderful, but Bill Nighy is the stand out for me.<br />Go to see it, you will not be disappointed. If you can see it on the big screen, the views of India are breathtaking. I felt it was like being in that mass of humanity that is India, and amazingly, it all worked.<br />The young owner of the hotel, Dev Patel, also is quite worth mentioning. He did a great job, and when he finally stands up for his girlfriend, well, that was a real 'moment'.<br />Not wanting to spoil the plot, I won't add more, but please consider seeing it! Finally, a movie that isn't all expletives, blowing up crap, over the top violence, etc. You have to pay attention here, but it is worth all the subtleties you will pick up on.
0143123173|5.0|Fantastic read! This is the series that A&E's Longmire is adapted from, and I can understand why. You can read these books and not have any spoilers for the show. Great story; with lots of interesting caricatures that suck you into their world. It is a mystery and modern day western all rolled into one book. There is some strong language, mild to medium violence, no heavy sex, lots of mystery, colorful caricatures, and vivid landscape descriptions.
B007FZ7R7W|4.0|With the who techno era taking up music and because chris has gone mainstream i thought i would hear an entire techno filled album. But to my surprise chris actually gave us a bit of the pop and also the rythm and blues. Chris did his thing on this album from the hip hop to the pop and r&b. One of my fav tracks is Mirage w/ Nas and im lovin don't judge me. But overall, he delivers very well on this album. Def worth adding to the collection.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was my third Lee Child's Jack Reacher book.  I read Bad Luck and Trouble, then Worth Dying For, and decided I wanted to start from the beginning.  What a ride the beginning is!  I was expecting a kind of dry thriller being that it was Lee Child's first Jack Reacher book but it blew me away.  I'd always wondered how Jack started his hitch hiking lifestlye and this book did a good job of starting that.  I still would like to know more about his past though and hoping to gain more in the next few months explainging this.  My favorite quote from the book was when Jack says \\"I'm not a vagrant.  I'm a hobo.  Big difference.\\" LOL!  There are multiple highlights in this book via the Kindle which are excellent for a criminal justice major like myself.  If you like Brad Thor or Vince Flynn...pick a Lee Child book up.  I promise you won't regret it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Not something to be read in front of children.  Made u look at the world through a different light.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|First off, let me state that I bought mine through Micro Center because they were offering the mobo I wanted in combination with this CPU when it first dropped for $280 as a package.  However, I highly doubt there will be a big difference in the chip based on where you bought it.<br /><br />This chip is out of this world.  I paired it with a Z77 mobo and it FLIES.  I've managed to successfully OC it to 4.6 GHz on air cooling (Cooler Master V-8) with temps ranging from 20C idle to 64C load.  That sounds high, but the TJMax for this chip is 105C and it's safe to push up to 90C.  I've still got enough room to MAYBE push 4.7 out of this, maybe.  Now note, you WILL NOT be able to push this chip much beyond 4.5 GHz without some serious cooling solutions thanks for Intel's decision to use paste instead of solder.  There is a major voltage/heat wall at 1.34v that will stop you in your tracks and the temps start rising fast at about 1.28-1.3v.  However, pound-for-pound, this chip is worth it in both my opinion and reviews over the last generation simply because of that native USB 3.0 support and PCI-E 3.0 support.  It will run neck-and-neck with a OC'ed Sandy Bridge, but offer the new supports.  Both may not be used heavily right now, but I'm future proofed for at least 1 1/2 years minimum.  Why not get the same performance with new toy for slightly more price?<br /><br />I do not use my system for heavy media processing so I cannot comment on that, but I do use it to see how far I can push the system and for gaming.  Just for an example, I'm running BF3 (which is very CPU intensive for a MP game) under ultra settings and only use  68-72% of my CPU potential.  My previous AMD 955 BE was under 100% the entire time and never let down.  I sadly had my GPU fry from static when I was rebuilding my system with this new chip and I got to play with the iGPU on the chip while I waited for my graphics card's RMA to finish.  I was NOT able to play high graphics intense games like BF3,but I was able to play games like Civilization 5 and Diablo 3 under high settings with 60+ FPS with just the integrated GPU.  That's impressive to me!<br /><br />If you're looking to upgrade to a new chip, this one will not let you down and will continue to zippy and take advantage of new technologies well into the future.  This chip is good for the gamer, a challenge for the OC'er, and PERFECT for the person who just wants to sit at home and watch Youtube.

B001P9EQH8|2.0|I have had the FiiO E5 Headphone Amplifier for over 12 months and for the first year or so, it worked amazingly. It gave me the increased volume I wanted, the bass I desired and yet... something was wrong. Last week, the charging cable no longer would remain in the charging slot and as of tonight, when trying to charge it (I don't like giving up), the moment I stuck it in my USB port it caused my entire PC to shut off. I thought maybe, it was my PC... so I tried it in my wife's computer and it DID THE SAME THING. I made sure it wasn't my PC by sticking in other devices that required a USB charge and they all work fine.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR LONG TERM USES!

0345535421|5.0|I was a big fan of the series on HBO, so I wanted to try and read the books to see how similar they are. I LOVE THEM! Just finished the first one, and now I'm on Clash of Kings with the next book on the way. I feel like if I didn't watch the show initially, this may have been a difficult read because it throws so many characters and places at you all at once. However, after reading the first book and watching Season 1, I found it an easy and intriguing read. Some parts of the show differ from the book, but what show/movie/etc. doesn't deviate from the storyline a little, huh? Either way, George R.R. Martin is a genius!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a simple calculator.  This is great and it fits full screen.  I would recommend to anyone.
0345803485|1.0|I downloaded the free sample of this for my Kindle and have only read that. Since I haven't read the whole thing, I want to point that out right away.  However I read the sample, found it atrocious, and will not be contributing my money to the sales of this best selling piece of trash.  First, the writing is terrible.  If this were written by a 12 or 13 year old, and I were a middle school English teacher, I would probably give the writing a \\"C\\" grade.  Second, the female lead character is portrayed as clumsy, stupid, naive, timid, afraid, etc.  I am not interested in reading about a female character who falls down upon walking into the lead male character's office,  then blushes repeatedly and at the same time drops her pen over and over again as she is supposedly taking an interview.  Next, when this very wealthy and powerful 27-year old man shows up at her work, which is at a hardware store, flirts with her in what she herself perceives as a threatening manner and buys cable ties, masking tape, and rope, she is still so dense that she doesn't have any thoughts about what this all might mean, and of course, has this intense craving to see him again, or there would be no book at all.  I do not enjoy reading about women portrayed as stupid, weak and afraid, and after reading the sample, I am not going to waste my money or any more of my time on this.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Having been a fan of the Alien franchise since I was in grade school, I was anxious to see this movie when I first heard about it. I then began hearing mixed reviews, and became wary about seeing it for fear it would be an enormous let down for me. I finally got around to seeing it, and I just have to say I am not the least bit disappointed. There are a lot of things in this movie that require interpretation on the viewer's part; they are not spelled out for you immediately. It also requires some knowledge of the first Alien movie- not so much the sequels. And some understanding in Greek mythology and the bible as well. If you want to see a movie that just spells it all out for you and you just have to sit there and watch it, this isn't the one for you. I thought it blended excellent elements of horror, suspense and amazing special effects into an incredible HR Giger-esque vision. Awesome movie. Can't wait to own it.

0307593312|3.0|Not one of my favorite Murakami books at all. I enjoyed parts of it, but the pace at which it gets going is frustratingly slow, and doesn't pick up enough after that to really make me forgive the first 300 pages. Yes, 300 pages - it took that long, or longer, for me to really get interested in the story. Normally when I'm finished one of his books I'm completely satisfied with the lack of answers he gives. This time I felt like the loose ends weren't left loose on purpose. There were a few very elegant resolutions, my favorite being what I believed about Tengo's mother. But other parts just felt unfinished and unexplained, not in a satisfying Murakami abstract way. That being said, thank you, Mr. Murakami, for not bashing me over the head with explanations about everything - I do like being able to tease out a few clues left in the text to figure out what's going on, and for that it's still one of the smartest books I've read in a long time.

B000P12LWY|5.0|It took a little while for me to warm up to the show - i liked it but didn't spend a whole night sleepless watching it until around episode 7, at which point there was no turning back.  As others mention already, the set designs, actors and screenplay are very well done.. but what intrigued me most was that the historical period of the story basically coincides with the division of the church, from the rule of Catholicism to the outbranches of \\"protest\\"-antism.  And the show goes on to become a study almost (and a very entertaining one at that) of the way this came to be (in England).  The story does a pretty fair job of presenting both the integrity and corruption of the Catholicism of Europe at the time and it likewise shows how and what drove the king to accept \\"reformist\\" versions of Christianity.  It's a fascinating study of a subject I really knew very little about and I come away feeling more informed somehow, and entertained into the bargain.  Even if religion isn't your thing, religion and politics were once quite married and intermixed with the state and it's fascinating to see these things portrayed - and to compare them with where we are now.  A fascinating historical story.  It's no wonder Shakespeare put it on the stage in his day.  Showtime has just sexed it up a bit.  And speaking of sex, if this show doesn't convince you of the power that libido plays behind the scenes, nothing will!
055357342X|2.0|It pains me to say how much I did not enjoy this book<br /><br />George RR Martin's story telling is like an old man who wants to tell you a story:<br />it starts out great and you cant wait to hear what happens to all the characters, but soon he's forgotten what the point of the story was, and he's gone off in 10 different directions you could care less about.<br />You keep listening intently until finally he's fallen asleep(ended the book), oh well, maybe he'll get to the point next time... nope!<br /><br />I'm trying to imagine how he was able to write a story with such great characters, and such a gripping story line, and yet somehow 4 or 5 of the main characters can die and you still feel like the story line wasnt advanced.<br />I think its funny how many people seem to hit their limit at 500 pages.  I was also very tempted to throw this book away after 500 pages... but i would not be so easily defeated!  I trudged trough the rest if this monotonous book like i was trying to get home after being lost in the woods.  I should have given up!<br /><br />in short, this book is 11 hundred some odd pages without the glossary in the back.<br />Each characters chapter is 10 pages each.  you could easily pack the same information of each chapter into 2 pages each.  That would make this book about 300 pages.  if this book were 300 pages it would be a 100% five star book
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Ok everyone if you're looking for the best bang for your buck, stop wasting your time and buy these now. They're an incredible value, offering nice tight bass, crystal clear highs, and pleasant mids. And they're very easy to drive. Anything you plug these into will sound good. I mainly use them with my mp3 player and I've never heard my iphone sound so good with ANY other headphones, iems, or earbuds. Beats by DRE and that Bose garbage don't even come close to these SONY MDR7506. Sure my Sennheiser HD 650s sound better, but only when paired with an expensive amp plus they're also more than 3x the price. At $100 I really think these can't be beat.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|It's really fun, to be honest. I've almost always loved playing the piano, or piano music for that matter, but this brings it to life.  A few setbacks are that in some songs, you have to have three notes played at one time (The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy), which is impossible for the Fire.

0345803493|1.0|I submitted my review of FIFTY SHADES DARKER to Amazon, and in the title of the review was an \\"obscene\\" word from the novel that I represented with its first letter, dashes, and its last letter, and then I wrote in my review:  \\"I'm the one who put the dashes in the word. I don't know if Amazon allows such words in reviews of the books it sells that contain those very words. So I perhaps err on the (unnecessary) side of caution.\\"<br /><br />It turns out I was not cautious enough and that, even with dashes, \\"obscene\\" words are not allowed on the site.<br /><br />Here is what Amazon had to say:  \\"We do not allow profane or obscene content. This applies to adult products too.\\"<br /><br />So, right, Amazon SELLS works with what they call \\"profane or obscene content.\\"  But you can't quote that content in a review (even when you take out some letters so you're not actually quoting that content in the first place).<br />(Amazon also sells adult products and prints some pretty racy reviews of them too.  If you like the FIFTY SHADES book, check them out.)<br /><br />This all strikes me as censoriously illogical.  However, Amazon has nicely invited me \\"to revise your review and submit it again.\\"<br /><br />So here goes (with apologies for perceived lacunae):<br /><br />Those curious to know what word Christian Grey hisses can find it (without my dashes) on p. 68 of the Vintage edition of FIFTY SHADES DARKER.<br /><br />That particular \\"obscene\\" word appears many times in the novel, usually in italics, in Ana's mind, and often preceded by the word \\"holy.\\"<br /><br />The word \\"hiss\\" or \\"hisses\\" also appears many times. Sometimes it is used to describe words that actually are sibilants. But in a case like this (see the title of this review), if Christian Grey is actually able to pronounce that word with a hiss, then he's an even bigger lisper than a reader would give him credit for being (and he seems like a guy who would lisp).<br /><br />But so is Ana: \\"'Why here?' I hiss at him.\\"<br /><br />You'd think they were made for each other. Instead of just made for making each other.<br /><br />This book gives writing a bad name. Thank goodness it doesn't do the same for sex (which does enough for itself to give itself a bad name). Desire...well: \\"Desire explodes like the Fourth of July throughout my body....My inner goddess is doing a triple axel dismount off the uneven bars [at seeing Christian unclothed for the umpteenth time]....My inner goddess cheers loudly to the rafters\\" as Ana kneels before Christian and then he...\\" sorry, I guess I can't quote this either, even though it contains no actual \\"obscene\\" words, only suggestive words, but see the same p. 68, where you'll learn what makes Christian hiss a word that only he can hiss.<br /><br />There used to be what was called automatic writing (sort of what Truman Capote accused Jack Kerouac of committing). E L James commits what seems to be unconscious writing. On one page, \\"He cocks his head to one side.\\" On the next page, \\"I cock my head to one side.\\"  (You supply the joke; mine has been removed.)<br /><br />\\" 'I could look at you all day, Anastasia.' \\"--page 76.<br /><br />\\"I could look at him all day.\\"--same darned page.<br /><br />Etc., etc. (see other reviewers who have punished themselves with having to type out this drivel).<br /><br />At first, I thought the mystery was why this book (this trilogy--I've also read the first) was published. Then I realized (helped along by the many positive reviews on Amazon) that it was published because people LOVE bad writing (\\"People do not deserve to have good writing, they are so pleased with bad.\\"--Emerson). (Heck, it's better to love it than not to recognize it.)<br /><br />So the mystery to me is why someone didn't help this author avoid embarrassment. Why didn't her editors? A kind theory is that they wanted her to be embarrassed, because they themselves were embarrassed to be publishing such a book that they were publishing for only one reason (whatever that might be) and hated themselves for having to hold their noses while they did it.<br /><br />The unkind theory is that the editors themselves don't know good writing from bad and so can do nothing to help writers from making fools of themselves.<br /><br />If that's true, then we should all go around hissing.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|If you like the classic Asia sound of melodic mid-tempo rock then you'll like this album quite a bit.  I was a huge fan of their last album (Omega) which I consider to be their 2nd best album (after their debut).  The new album is very similar to Omega and again features great melodies, solid lyrics, and excellent performances by all band members.  The clear star on this album is John Wetton whose voice is somehow better now then it was back in the 80's.  His voice sounds magnificent here. Geoff Downes and John Wetton have writen a strong batch of sounds and Howe and Palmer added the guitar and drums to create a great summer album.  Enjoy!
B00884GR0W|3.0|this isn't minecraft but it is fun. although I usually get mauled at night I like it but what really ticks me off is that it crashes and the controls suck only buy if your kindle works really well
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it a nice game best one I have play in a while n also it very easy n that it so this it
B001NS5F62|5.0|Probably the best Dire Straits album.  Bluesy, jazzy, smooth, yet hot.  Possibly the best guitar riffs by Mark Knopfler.  Truly a classic album.
B0080R7Q70|4.0|I haven't been enthralled with the Flower Kings as of late.  Really enjoy their earlier stuff, but one can say that about any prog group I suppose.  I was about to write this one off until I heard disc 2.  Much better than disc 1.  I guess it's just a matter of personal taste, but I like them best with the hooks and chord changes.  Not really into their Zappa stuff.  I like their diversity in music, but sometimes seems like they get off on a tangent of something going nowhere.  Pretty good prog group though, what few that are left.
B005LAII0I|4.0|Reminded me of the humor and wit found in \\"The Princess Bride\\".<br />Well done and interestingly played out. A movie to be viewed more than once.
B007I2BZIE|1.0|Don't know why I continue to support these artists who's time has come and gone?  Nothing but noise.  Not too much unlike the rest of the garbage they call music today!
B0052VUNHC|3.0|Let me preface this with the fact that I am an editor, and although all I do at work is read, i love to read a lot of lighter books at home.<br />I picked this book up because I had read an article about the books like Shades of Grey that are being optioned for movies. Although i read the book in a day, and i loved the story and the characters, i felt like there was a lot of character development missing and a lot of text that could have been condensed.<br /><br />I was appalled at how poorly edited this book was. I am completely for self-publishing and this entire book publishing revolution that has been happening over the years with authors bypassing publishing houses, but at the end of the day the author is putting a product out there that is flawed and no one who is paying for a book should find typos and just plain sloppiness. It's almost as if the writer did not even re-read her work.<br /><br />I urge all self-published writers to PLEASE, PLEASE spend a little money and get yourself an editor, not a friend to read your work, but an EDITOR, someone who knows what a book needs, someone who knows the rules of writing and someone who knows simple copyediting. My joy for this book, and many others i have read recently, including 50 Shades of Grey were dampened because i could not get over the poor writing, the obvious over use of a Thesaurus and the simple typos. I wish i could give it more stars, but my experience was truly marred.
014312093X|4.0|A friend of mine was insistent that I read this, as it was one of his favorites, so even though the beginning is slow and difficult to get invested in, I chugged through. The narrative improves, and it becomes much more apparent why this novel is considered to be such a classic. I certainly enjoy a good spy thriller dime novel read, but that's not what this was. This was much more of a high brow literary novel. John le Carre demonstrations his ability to create believable humanity, and focuses on the development of the characters, especially the protagonist, far more than on the \\"plot.\\" Slow at times, but has much to offer.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is very addicting!!  When I first downloaded it onto my phone, it would freeze up or run very slowly.  I got a new phone and it works great! Now I want to download it onto my Kindle Fire.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|I must admit I wasn't expecting much from the new Beach Boys album. I honestly thought it would be a lackluster effort from a group of senior citizens out to make a money grab to help support their retirement. Boy was I wrong. The songs on this CD are, for the most part, first rate and the harmonies are still there after all these years. It does my heart good to know that a group I grew up listening to is still around (minus two original members) and putting out great music.
B004UIXZV4|2.0|Peu de reproches à faire concernant le contenu (évidemment !), mais la typographie laisse franchement à désirer. Le peu de fautes d'orthographe et autres coquilles rend néanmoins la lecture agréable - à la différence du deuxième volume de la Recherche en édition gratuite.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I know the in-thing right now is to bash Tom Cruise but after watching Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol you might have a change of mind. He is that good in this film. The action is intense(especially the Dubai high rise sequence) and so is the suspense. Get this movie. You won't regret it. In my opinion it is the best of the Mission Impossible movie series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the series.  I couldn't put it down. Can't wait for this authors next series.  The book was enjoyable and I hated for it to end.
B0014BEDBG|4.0|Bought this for my husband who was thrilled.  Justin Timberlake is truly talented and puts on an incredible show.  The commentary and backstage outtakes gives you a personal insight into the making of the tour.  You will not be disappointed.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun but a little repetitive . Not unlike marriage. could use more variety&hellip;, wink&hellip;.Wow this us a pain on the K F.
0345803507|5.0|I loved the entire series.  Couldn't put it down.  Just kept reading and reading.  Wish there were more..  Will be looking for more books by this author.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|this is the same game available on the PC from big fish.  I love that game.<br /><br />but I find that it is too small to see on the kindle fire.  some screens are ok, but most are too crowded.  It needs to let you pinch to enlarge as all such games do.<br /><br />what I dislike most is that you can't exit without needing to start over.  this is the first game I've come accross that didn't save your progress when you went to menu.  it warns you that it will happen, but leaves you stuck if you want to exit.  the PC version doesn't do that.<br /><br />bottom line is that it would be 5 stars if you could 'pinch' to enlarge the screen, and save to exit.<br /><br />this isn't ready for kf and android yet.
B0015AARJI|3.0|The PS3 controller has buttons that sometimes don't work.  Also it shuts off on its own from time to time.  Technically, the controller does work, but it's very evident that the controller is not in great shape.
B003LXSY60|5.0|This is a really solid album - it's great from beginning to end. Catchy but never trite. Favorites include Everlasting Light, Tighten Up, and The Only One. The Black Keys just continue to improve.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|This is classic Stanley Kubrick.  Loved it!  Luckily I missed the Vietnam war by a year, but lived through the country's turmoil over the war.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game it is beyond addictive it is the best game ever there is not one better. I totally recommend this game to the world.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|I'm not one to complain about a free app, but as you can not pay the fourth mission without either spending money or replaying earlier missions I have to. I'm promptly uninstalling this money grab.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its the best game ever I think everybody should get this game and it is the best so just get it
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|This was different and refreshing!  I didn't know what to expect when I decided to watch this movie and I'm glad I didn't read the reviews... I really enjoyed it!  I think it showed a great deal of artistic creativity and talent to have this movie keep the viewer entertained for its full length especially considering the plethora of special effects that are commonplace in full length films today.  Well done!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome and it has really cool games geeeeeeeeettttttttttt tttttthhhhhhhhiiiiiiisssss aaaapppppp get it! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  please please getthis app
B007Z5WMCW|1.0|it made me watch a commercial before I could watch the show. and when I got to the show wasn't even in English. you also don't even get to pick your own show
B007MDB71O|4.0|Due to being called a box-office bomb and some bad word of mouth, I expected a bad movie, but John Carter is a fun space opera. The movie is daring and a little old fashion for a movie with such great CGI which is why some people just write it off as bad. The film also gets called a StarWars rip-off when the books were written by the writer of Tarzan and around much longer.<br />  Taylor Kirsch (Friday Night Lights) was even picked on by Richard Roeper but he had a lot more charm and charisma than he got credit for. While William Dafoe (Spider-Man) does brilliant voice work as Tars Tarkas, an alien that believes in John Carter from the start but he also wants Carter to fight for his race due to Carter's great jumping ability. You also have Mark Strong (Sherlock Holmes) good as always in a villain role of course as a shapeshifting alien and Lynn Collins as one of the sexiest Princesses on film in awhile and she of course is Carter's love interest. Oh and I want Carter's loyal alien dog that follows him everywhere.<br />  John Carter is one to be open minded about and to form your own opinion with. The film had bad marketing and wasn't even advertised as being based on a book which sometimes helps. It also was in the top 10 at the box office for a couple of weeks but was constantly picked on due to how much it cost. If it didn't cost so much to make, it would have been considered a hit.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this to come out on the kindle fire! It has awesome graphics and is free. What can be better than that? BTW; it does not freeze.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I love this game so much! My uncle introduced me to it and I started to play, and I fell in love:)
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I know it's free, but requiring my email or facebook password to play is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous and highly insecure. No app is so cool that it is worth having my identity stolen. About to uninstall this security risk
B007N31YFW|4.0|\\"Sound of Noise\\" is rooted in a boldly original premise. Six Swedish drummers set out to perform 'Music for One City and Six Drummers.'  To pull it off, the percussionists must perform the composition's four movements at various public locations using non-musical objects, vehicles and even body parts. The performances bring to mind the way the [[ASIN:0783113331 Stomp]] theater group uses everyday objects to create complex polyrhythms. Additionally, the activist drummers assemble and operate in a way that reminisces the clandestine yet humorous antics of the criminal team in \\"[[ASIN:B000P0J0BK Ocean's Eleven]].\\" \\"Sound of Noise\\" gives an original spin on the cops and robbers plot thread as police officer Amadeus Warnebring pursues the bohemian pranksters. The pursuer and pursued come together for a zany ending that invokes the absurd but is entirely hilarious. It's an indie film that's likely to resonate with musicians and drummers in particular. It feels like an art house film done with a big budget, complete with fantastic visual effects. The film can only be watched in Swedish with English subtitles. Much of the quirky film experience is visual and musical; so despite the language barrier, it shouldn't be a difficult watch for most American viewers. In any case, the Swedish cityscape makes for a vivid setting. The novel storyline, music and acting make for a memorable watch. So in the end, \\"Sound of Noise\\" is anything but noise.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|If I were you I would get this app it looks sweet. my kindle fire broke so I'm usnig my sisters. I would just get this app!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great free app. I like being able to pop open my kindle and waste some time when needed while playing something fun! I am not too far into the game but I like it so far. the excesive advertising is a little annoying but I am looking forward to seeing what other games are on this app!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I am not much of a reader at all. I actually have an IEP and struggled in school so I always hated reading when I had to. So when I finished the book in a week and 4 days I was so proud of myself. The book kept me wanting to read more. I just couldn't put it down. I am on the second book right now and i'm almost done that book as well. after a lil over a week. I'm enjoying this series so much when I'm done I will order more books from Suzanne Collins. Thank you very much.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This epic recording is so far ahead of its time that it remains relevant two generations later. Just amazing. Dark Side is a combination of smokin' R&B, esoteric electronica, and some of the finest guitar work of all time.
B0086700CM|5.0|I thought I wouldn't get too addicted to this but I was wrong. I have been playing this game for hours. real life seems sad now.. sometimes it'll do something weird like jump when you mean to turn but it might just be me so I'm still giving it 5 stars.
0307346617|5.0|First of all I loved it. I couldn't put it down. I couldn't wait for each new chapter, and I was deeply saddened that it had to end. The perspective in which the book is written is something I have never seen before and took a little getting used to, but after the second chapter I got it and then began to fly right through it. Max Brooks has an attention to detail that sometimes made me feel like I was reading an actual historical account rather than fiction. You can visualize every interview as it is being told and each one has it's own twist, whether it's confronting the horror of the zombie war, dealing with the remains of humanity and sanity, or even just the endurance of the human spirit.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter he leaves just the slightest hint of suspense that makes your imagination take over and run wild. I have read other reviews and can see why this would turn some people off. If you crave a neat tidy little ending with all the loose strings tucked away then you won't like this book. As for me, it just plain worked. There were a few chapters that I simply wished would not end, but that made the suspense and the atmosphere of the world that much greater. I felt for the characters. I could see myself in their shoes. There is no way to describe it without giving away all the juicy bits that make the work complete. But you won't be able to stop once you get into it. Did I mention that I loved it?<br /><br />I give World War Z my highest recommendation. Bar none. Period.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I was so excited to get into this book- more than anything because the whole of the female race seems to be engrossed, and i was seeing it everywhere. The comments of how people could not pt it down, and how their eyes just seemed to go all glossy while they spoke...... turned me into a curious cat! People whop i respect and believe to be on the same level as me......How could i not read it?<br /><br />Well, i made it to about 40% of the book, with no real story line in sight. I happened to get that far on the hope that there actually was. Eventually i asked a friend, (who was now onto the second book) whether there was actually a story line, and when she replied \\"well, no, not really\\", i could not waste my time any longer. It is not often that i actually put a book down. I always hope that climax does come... often i realize that there was no real climax. I decided on this book that i need to stop doing that.<br /><br />With no story, and just sex, sex and more sex......it gets a bit boring. Real quickly. It has not been written well either. Don't waste your money. Trust me.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This is my first review of any product on Amazon.<br /><br />While I wont discuss the film plots and details, I would just like to voice my own opinion on these 4 films. Batman, and Batman Returns stand out as the darkest and most ambitious of the 4 films. My personal favorite of any Batman film is Batman Returns. Mostly because The Penguin is my all time favorite Batman villain<br />(who can argue against penguins with rockets strapped to them?), and has the best Catwoman. That 2004 atrocity doesn't exist in my book. But dont get me wrong, the first film has the best Joker to date. Yes I prefer the Nicholson Joker over Ledger Joker only because the Dark Knight Joker seemed way to dark and violent, and instead of crazy and fun. But back the the anthology films. While Batman Forever and Batman & Robin are not the worst of films in terms of quality, they completely fail in capturing the true darkness of Batman. They almost seem to poke fun at the first 2 films. But to the average moviegoer and not much of a Batman fan, they are enjoyable.<br />The discs themselves and the packaging are superb. Very cool case and actually having the movies and bonus material discs in their own respective cases makes it hard to damage the discs. This is the perfect set for any Batman fan, despite having 2 out of the 4 films actually worth watching, I will still give the set 5 stars. I mean come on.... its Batman. :D
B007SGM084|5.0|Definitely a great read. Outside of the known erotica the book is a great love story. U need to get all three they blend so easily and if I didn't have the trilogy at once I would have been going crazy! Read them all in 2 days!!<br /><br />Enjoy!!
B0086700CM|5.0|it needs to have the movie brave version of temple run and its the best game on my kindle fire I love temple run!!
B007KUFDBY|4.0|My wife and I, along with our two children, both below the age of eight, watched this movie yesterday. While the kids enjoyed watching the film, as did I, my wife found the movie to be a bit bland.<br /><br />Certainly, the cinematography is excellent, as are both the computer animated and hand drawn sequences. The technical presentation of the film on blu-ray is certainly first rate. Both the video and audio aspects of the film are very good.<br /><br />However the plot seems a bit forced, as does the juxtaposition of 18th century sailing vessels, and associated crew members, with advanced technology, including robots, cyborgs and interstellar space travel. While the plot is coherent, and at times interesting, it just doesn't feel right, as if the directors and producers could not decide if they wanted to have a pirate film, with all the trappings implied with such a film, or an interstellar space travel film. In the end, they tried to do both and it just doesn't come out right.<br /><br />Will the kids watch the movie again? Probably. Will it become one of their favorite films? Probably not. Is it a good distraction for kids and adults for an evening spent watching a movie? Yes.
0062060562|5.0|I started this book and was afraid to fall asleep before I finished it. I was afraid to go to sleep and not remember it in the morning like the main character, Christine. Every day she wakes up, she has no idea where she is and doesn't even recognize herself in the mirror. Every day she starts all over from the beginning wondering what in the world is going on.<br />  I found this to be a fascinating psychological story and the last chapters make very suspenseful reading. A great way to spend a summer day.
0345525558|5.0|This special novel follows the coming of age and beginning of real life for Victoria. Having been raised in the foster care system, we meet her as she turns eighteen. She is becoming an adult, embarking on a life of her own.<br /><br />The book is written in alternating parts, between Victoria's childhood and present day. She is having trouble moving forward in life while holding onto the baggage of a damaged childhood.<br /><br />Victoria's solace has always been in flowers. She finds comfort in the meaning of them, and symbols associated with them, the language of them. Insecure, and truly unable to communicate her feelings to those around her, Victoria relies on this as a sort of second language. Eventually, this does become a connection.<br /><br />It has long been believed by many cultures that flowers have healing properties. This can be medicinal, physical, psychological or even emotional. This was the case with Victoria.<br /><br />The story of Victoria is full of thorns and sharp burrs that stick to the reader. Yet the author offers the reader a bouquet of experiences of a true survivor. A good Summer read, this book is memorable.<br /><br />A bonus: at the rear of the book is Victoria's Dictionary of Flowers, in alphabetical order. She lists the flower name, botanical name, and the meaning of the flower. The list is long, from Abutelon (Abutelon)...Meditation, to Zinnia (Zinnia)...I mourn your absence.

1401937519|5.0|After reading the book I felt better about myself.  Anita wrote about not fitting in, never being good enough, and how this affected the way she lived her life.  By the end of the book she has gone through a transformation to feeling/being perfect.  She took me along with her.  A satisfying read.
B0063GORYU|5.0|IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!! If you get it you will LOVE it so I am telling you get it trust me you will LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|Saw The Grey last night.  I loved it.  Just when you think you've seen every permutation of the survival movie, one comes along and blows them all away.  Neeson isn't saddled with an American accent so he can actually emote without restraint which enhanced his character to be much more than a typical action hero.  I felt for each person who died because I was placed firmly behind Neeson's eyes and never felt like they were just going through the motions.  Even as their numbers dwindled I kept rooting for them to survive, even the jerk who went on about the wallets.  And that ending was just perfect.
B000000WCV|5.0|im from argentina, and i didnt know what to expect from a used cd,,, but it was really good purchase,
B0088W2LC2|3.0|Overall the product is exactly the show you'd expect. But the recording on file has 2-3 minute dead spots where the commercials were. This isn't drawn from the disc editions, it's drawn from the TV masters.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I wish Amazon allowed 1/2 stars, but oh well.  Anyway, I have to say I read a lot of books and it has been a loooong time since I've come across a book that I thoroughly enjoyed that has a wonderful story that I do not want to put down.  This story was lengthy, but it didn't feel like it.  I really didn't want it to end.  In many books that I read, there are so many pages of superfluous writing that I have to skip over to get back to the interesting parts; however, in this book, I found there were hardly any pages that were insignificant.  It seemed as if something was always happening and everything was so interesting, I was completely captivated by the story.  I loved this story and how refreshing it was.  I really can't wait until the sequel.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the reason I took off a 1/2 star is because of all the grammatical errors.  I'm not sure if that's because of the editor or if because it was a Kindle edition and sometimes with Kindle, they seem to mess up a lot of the grammar.  The only other negative thing I can point out, is that sometimes all of the unusual names and places made it difficult to follow.  There were a few times I was confused on who the author was referring to and the place.  But I quickly caught on after a stumble here and there and I was so enthralled with the story, it didn't matter all that much.<br /><br />To sum up, I really recommend this book if you enjoy fantasy or science fiction.  I really liked the main character, Vaelin Al Sorna; a true hero and an ideal man.  Can't wait for book 2!<br /><br />Update:  after I thought about it, I really should have rated this 5 stars, instead of 4. I can't stop thinking about it and thinking it really is a great story.  I can't seem to enjoy any books lately because they don't seem to compare; hurry with book 2 please!
0525423656|3.0|This is the sequel to Matched. I liked Crossed better than Matched, partly because it has less of a typical science fiction plot. Ky and Cassia and some other characters escape into the canyons and try to find the \\"Rising\\", the rebellion against the Society. In the end, though, it seems to me, the Rising is not much better than the Society. They have their own tight rules; you are not allowed to have \\"unnecessary possessions.\\"  The book did have an interesting plot, but it was kind of depressing. However, I did like the descriptions of the beauty and loneliness of the canyon. Also, some interesting new characters are introduced in Crossed, each with their own complicated story, and secrets are revealed. The Matched trilogy is definitely not my favorite science fiction, but I will read the third book when it comes out, if only to see what happens in the end    *You can read all of my book reviews at my blog, [...]

0375830995|4.0|This fanciful and funny book was written by the same author as the Book Thief, which is one of my favorite books. I Am the Messinger is certainly not as serious as the Book Thief at first glance, but it is actually pretty meaningful. Ed Kennedy, an underage cab driver without much of a future inadvertently stops a bank robbery. Then, he gets an Ace of Diamonds in the mail, with some addresses on the back. That's when he becomes \\"the messenger.\\" He is chosen to care about people in need in many different ways, and to help them. But one question remains. Who's behind Ed's mission? I really loved this book, though the plot doesn't sound that interesting at first. But it was a clever book, and I liked the characters, including the Doorman, his stinky, coffee-loving dog, his ever-cursing mother, a whole host of dysfunctional friends, the people who he's helping, and of course, Ed Kennedy himself. I really enjoyed reading this book, which was a pretty fast read. Also, the ending was really sweet and just felt right.    *You can read all of my reviews at my book blog, [...]*

0307744434|5.0|I first read The Night Circus in January, and I just loved it so much. Here is what I said in my original review: \\"This was a really good book. It was darkly mysterious, and made me want to keep on reading, and not put it down. It tells of the Night Circus, or Le Cirque des Reves, which is an amazing circus that opens only at night. Inside the circus, however, a fierce competition or \\"game\\" is going on between two illusionists, Marco and Celia, bound by their masters to play the game to completion. They innocently fall in love, not realizing how the game must end- with only one person left standing. One thing that I really enjoyed about the book were the fanciful descriptions about the circus and its tents. It made me feel like I was really there in the circus, breathing in the scents and sounds. I also liked the ideas for tents that the author had; they were really wonderful. There is a beautiful and complicated clock in the middle of the circus, and I loved how its clockwork was described. The ending was a bit enigmatic, but it was meant to be that way, I think.\\"    I loved The Night Circus just as much, if not more, the second time around. The writing style is my definitely my favorite part about the book; it just melts in your mouth like the confections at the circus itself. As you can see from the opening few sentences under the title \\"Anticipation\\", it really does build up the suspense and anticipation. The plot itself is also really great. The Night Circus just hooks you. Oh, how I would love to visit Le Cirque des Reves (which actually means The Circus of Dreams), with its beautiful clock, and outstanding shows. All at night.  And the book is dreamlike in a way, because of course, nothing like this could happen in real life. The Night Circus is quite romantic too. The two main characters of Marco and Celia are very strong too, and I loved both of them, as well as the supporting characters. Whether you like fantasy, romance, or historical fiction, everyone should at least try this one. It's one of my Top Ten Books, and I think it's been elevated to third or fourth by my rereading it.    *You can read all of my reviews at my blog at [...]

1423140591|4.0|The sequel to The Lost Hero, this is a pretty good book. If you've read any other books of Riordan's, you'll know that the heroes usually travel across the country (or the world) on their quest. In The Son of Neptune, Percy (from Camp Half-Blood, though he doesn't know it as his memory is lost), Frank, and Hazel, travel up the West Coast, through northern California, Oregon, and finally, Alaska. It's kind of frustrating though, cause if you've read the other Greek series, you know who Percy is and you really want him to find out. But it's a suspenseful and funny book, full of adventure.<br /><br />However, one of the characters is named Frank Zhang, and he's supposedly Chinese. But there are some very cliched views of Chinese people in the book and Zhang does not mean \\"master of bows\\" in Chinese, as Riordan claims. It means open. Riordan obviously didn't really do his research that well.<br />I still liked it though, and I really can't wait to read the third book, The Mark of Athena; the book built up a lot of suspense. I think the title of the next book has something to do with Annabeth, who is Athena's daughter. And, by the way, I like the Greeks way better than the Romans. Just saying.<br /><br />*You can read all of my reviews at my blog, [...]

B004LROMWU|5.0|Dystopian future films are seemingly popular, but sci-fi always has a difficult transition to television.  In Falling Skies, many of the difficulties are present, and may eventually prove to be fatal to the series.  As it is, a group of survivors known as the 2nd Massachusetts (Revolutionary War reference) attempts everyday survival and resistance against green, spider-like aliens referred to derisively as \\"skitters\\" in the aftermath of world destruction.<br /><br />The characters are real.  They are fighters and survivors who grow beyond themselves yet recognize the power of camaraderie and numbers.  Everyday people thrust into a post-apocalyptic, planetary takeover do not commandeer jets like in Battlefield Earth; they certainly do not gain stage [[ASIN:B008602KQI The Hunger Games]] or become the world's leading expert in [[ASIN:B003KRJNBW The Book of Eli]]; and they do not suddenly turn into a homogenous community of General Patton clones.  They scratch, claw, and fight for survival.<br /><br />Speaking of Patton, I don't know why Will Patton, as Capt. Dan Weaver, is taking such a beating by some.  I think his performance as a troubled leader of a rag-tag group of survivors is great.  Regardless of personal experience, a military commander is going to face extreme difficulties when dealing with an assorted group of people lacking the rigid structure and discipline possessed by those in the military.  Even his executive officer, Tom Mason (Noah Wyle), displays just enough disobedience to usurp some of Patton's power, and ultimately weaken his stature amongst the 2nd Mass survivors.  Adding to his headache is scene stealer John Pope (Colin Cunningham), an outsider, loose-cannon who mixes aplomb with insanity.<br /><br />The sci-fi and FX are a mixed bag.  Sometimes the blending is seamless.  In other instances, it's pretty movement is a bit choppy.  Story-wise, the technology is sufficiently advanced that humans don't suddenly start incorporating it to its fullest extent (looking at you, [[ASIN:B0012HF5NC Independence Day]]).  In one gruesome plot-line, the aliens attach mind-controlling devices (called \\"harnesses\\") to the spinal columns of children.  This has been criticized by some, but it's not like adults and children have ever been divided in sci-fi before, [[ASIN:0765351986 right]]?<br /><br />I truly enjoy the series for what it is.  It's more drama than action, an evenly paced storyline that reveals just enough to entice.  Unfortunately, like so many other good sci-fi series (Firefly, Sarah Connor, V, Terra Nova), I expect this series to be cancelled in favor of the next CSI, SVU, cooking, auction, or repo \\"reality\\" show.<br /><br />(Extras: Extended pilot, audio commentary, Comic-Con panel, Behind the Scenes features (Skitter & Harness makeup), deleted scenes, and a Season 2 preview)extent (looking at you, [[ASIN:B0012HF5NC Independence Day]]).

B000UBMWG4|3.0|Blade Runner (1982), based on \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" by Philip Dick, is a disappointing film.  Its superior premise, production design and talent would all lead one to expect a masterpiece, a worthy follow-up to Ridley Scott's 1979 classic, Alien.  Even the movie poster artwork promises a dangerous, thought-provoking, and exciting dystopia film.  But Blade Runner doesn't capitalize on its many assets; it stagnates, rather than reaching its full potential.<br /><br />Simply put, it doesn't go anywhere.  Harrison Ford himself recognized this when he commented that the film's plot was centered around a man's relationship with his toaster.  The script doesn't climax; it travels in a straight line.  When Roy Batty delivers his excellent \\"tears in rain\\" monologue at the end, the effect is not what it ought to be because the story has not meant anything up to that point.  There are many excellent scenes that have beauty and meaning throughout the film.  Some of them are very successful on a primal level, such as the love scene between Harrison Ford and Sean Young.  Others are effective at evoking a specific mood, such as the nightclub scene near the middle of the picture, and the many shots of Deckard walking through the dark, nightmarish city.  The point is that a string of scenes in row can all be individually brilliant, but they are meaningless as a whole unless they have something to tie them together beyond actors, cinematography, and basic premise.  Blade Runner needs a real story, a compelling story.  And that is the one component that this film lacks.<br /><br />Blade Runner, however, remains an enjoyable film after multiple viewings.  Many viewers have reported hating the film the first time that they watched it, but as they watch it again and again, it begins to grow upon them until they finally begin to love it.  I, perhaps, can count myself in this category.  I was supremely disappointed after the first viewing, but after seeing the movie multiple times, I knew where the plot was going and rather than feeling disappointed, I was free to concentrate on the assets of the film: the beautiful cinematography, the production design, the music, and the overall mood that has been evoked.  In fact, Blade Runner has so many assets and so much potential that it is all the more painful that something as fundamental as the script held it back from becoming a masterpiece of the genre.  Nonetheless, Blade Runner remains an important film, and its influence in the science-fiction genre is indisputable.

B005LAIHSQ|3.0|Hollywood doesn't do these very often and that alone is enough to coax many movie viewers to go see \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\". A true sign of that is the epic performance of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies and the giddiness in many that a \\"Hobbit\\" trailer foretells of another. \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" is no \\"Lord of the Rings\\", but a more fair comparison would be to a movie like \\"Legend\\". It isn't perfect, but it is without question a worthy addition to the short list of fantasy adventure movies that Hollywood sometimes backs.<br /><br />\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" has many qualities but the most standout one of those, even above the knockout special effects, is the performance of Oscar winner Charlize Theron (\\"Monster\\", \\"Reindeer Games\\"). She is haunting in her portrayal of the evil Queen Raveena. Like every great actress does, she took her role and made it hers, unique and hypnotizing. The torment that she goes through to remain on top of the spell she has been saddled with is something you can't take your eyes off. Theron is having a big time summer, because next week she'll appear in \\"Prometheus\\".<br /><br />\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" is also gifted with amazing special effects. The images and cinematography of the film rival that of \\"Legend\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\" easily. Although there are moments where, as the band who are protecting Snow White travel, I couldn't help but think of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and that's never a good thing. The sweeping sceneries and orchestra music were too similar to \\"Rings\\". This can be overlooked because it is so fleeting.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart (\\"Twilight\\", \\"Zathura\\", \\"Panic Room\\") plays Snow White and as much as I wasn't sure of her acting abilities, I'm more confident now that she's capable. Sometimes I feel she leaves her urgency and emotion behind and maybe that's a sign of a person who started acting when she was nine. An acting career was sort of put at her footstep before she knew how to achieve it. She is twenty-two now and has been in many successful films. There are moments in the film that are a little over dramatized as she works soldiers into frenzy like Joan of Arc, but all in all, she was \\"Snow White\\" and she did the movie justice.<br /><br />\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" is certainly not perfect and it is certainly not going to be one of the most talked about movies of the summer. Yet, in a summer full of superheroes, aliens and talking teddy bears, it is the only adventure fantasy until \\"The Hobbit\\" comes along in December. If you enjoy movies with mythical creatures, unstoppable evil's and heroes emerging, then \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" might just be a good fit for you.twenty-two now and has been in many successful films.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|Those who are familiar with the names Ridley Scott, H.R. Giger & \\"Alien\\" got a slow trickling of information about the movie release of \\"Prometheus\\". It's story, plot and origin were a complete mystery and should remain that way until you view it. The mystery surrounding the movie is as intense, mysterious and teasing as the trailer included with this review. In fact, the trailer is a fair depiction of what you will get with the film. You will get great science fiction, intense gut wrenching scenes and mysterious cave drawings that lead scientists to another world.<br /><br />Don't talk to many people who have already seen \\"Prometheus\\" before going. You don't want to know. If you enjoy great science fiction and you enjoyed the \\"Alien\\" series of movies, just go. \\"Prometheus\\" is beautiful and horrifying at the same time. It isn't for the squeamish. I will be ultra careful not to tell too much as well.<br /><br />Those familiar with the \\"Alien\\" series are also familiar with the name \\"Weyland Industries\\". They are the corporation behind the original \\"Alien\\" movies. They are the money and brains behind the operation to explore alien life forms. So when Elizabeth Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace (who rose to fame with the Swedish \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" movies), finds cave drawings all over earth that are similar, it leads her and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway to question our origins. Who are we and where did we come from?<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" is more thought provoking than action movie. Not to say that the action isn't plentiful, but the thought and development that went into the film are top notch, as well as the acting, direction and cinematography. There really isn't much to criticize about the film. \\"Prometheus\\" is pure and simple, great escapism cinema. You will be gone away for two hours to a place that will have you thinking, wondering and cringing.<br /><br />There have been a great variety of summer movies this year and Hollywood has finally learned a valuable lesson about moviegoers. We want variety. \\"Prometheus\\" is possibly one of the best science fiction movies of all time, emphasis on the science. It mixes the \\"Alien\\" genre with a great movie like \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\". It does what every great movie should do, make you question and make you think.

I asked my husband if it took away from what the episodes first look like and he said absolutely not. The improvements in no way took away from enjoying the series again as a true Trekkie! There were lots of extras on the disc...interviews, some explanation on what was done to the film and just lots of very interesting info.

B005LAIHZE|2.0|Seth Grahame-Smith wrote the fictional novel \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" and it was published in 2010. So, the fictional concept of Lincoln being a vampire hunter in his secret life wasn't first realized in film form, but it is the first time many who aren't familiar with the book became privy to the extreme concept. Some rolled their eyes at the concept, some chuckled and some were intrigued to see how the creators of the book and film could make the fictional secret life of Lincoln feasible.<br /><br />Benjamin Walker, a virtual unknown, is an uncanny likeness to Lincoln and that is definitely one of the great values to the film. The moviemakers couldn't have found a better actor to play the part and as much as he is an unknown, he won't be for long. He definitely held his own. His ability to fight vampires with passion and then become the distinguished gentlemen and amazing public speaker that we are all aware of made believing the secret life that much easier.<br /><br />That being said, \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" suffers from the summer blockbuster expectations. Summer blockbusters are usually crammed full with movies with so much cheese and over-the-topness you just want to roll your eyes, and I didn't want to roll my eyes. I wanted the creators of the movies to convince me, as much as I know vampires are as real as fairies and dragons, that this secret life was possible. Most of the movie did a good job of blending known facts with fictional elaboration, but then the creators knew they had to please those that have made guys like Bay, Emmerich & Wiseman filthy rich every summer.<br /><br />Had \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" had a release date outside of the summer blockbuster season, maybe the lowered expectations would have kept them from going off the deep end just to give everybody a slam bam `watch this' finale. After successfully building a reality threshold throughout the film, keeping a nice blend of history and fiction, they destroyed that illusion.<br /><br />I had hoped that \\"AL: Vampire Hunter\\" would have had more tact than it did. I had hoped that there would have been more intelligence and more history, but there wasn't. Instead, the movie dragged through out, only brush stroking over the things we know as fact about Abraham Lincoln and never delving below the surface. The movie has some merit. As I stated before, Walker is a great Lincoln and the effects were amazing, but the makers should have spent more time maintaining the illusion to the audience that maybe, possibly Lincoln was a vampire slayer. Instead, they left us realizing that it was just another empty summer effects showcase.that illusion.<br /><br />I had hoped that \\"AL: Vampire Hunter\\" would have had more tact than it did.

B005LAIHRC|4.0|This has to be one of my favorite summers for movies in years. There has been such an amazing variety and now we have a Rock-N-Roll Musical amongst the superheroes, aliens and action stars.<br /><br />\\"Rock of Ages\\" is an adaption of a Broadway rock comedy musical that debuted as on off-Broadway production in 2008 but made its debut in Los Angeles 2005. Constantine Maroulis of American Idol fame played the lead character, Drew Boley, in the Broadway production and has a cameo role in the film. Diego Boneta takes on that role in the film. He is probably one of the lesser known of the cast that includes Julianne Hough, Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin, Mary J. Blige, Catherine Zeta Jones, Malin Ackerman and Tom Cruise as legendary rock god Stacee Jaxx, a role without question inspired by Guns-N-Roses front man Axel Rose.<br /><br />The movie and the play are set back in the late 80's when Rock-N-Roll was decadent and king. Dennis Dupree (Baldwin), owns the rock club The Bourbon Room that I can only assume is based on the real rock club The Whiskey in Los Angeles. Sherrie Christian (Hough) is an Oklahoma girl who takes the bus to Los Angeles to pursue her Hollywood dreams. Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) is a legendary rock star who is lost in a sea of scotch, decadence and his own persona. Drew Boley (Boneta) is a bartender who is a rising star. All of these characters come together to form the story.<br /><br />There is nothing unique about the storyline to the film. All of the stories that mold together are pretty clich&eacute; and predictable. The romances that form and the dilemma's faced and dealt with have been seen and done before. Yet, the truth is, the movie isn't about the stories that are formed during the course of the movie by the actors. The movie is a love affair with a Rock-N-Roll age that ruled in the late 80's and has since been forgotten in an age of boy bands, studio-enhanced albums and conformity.<br /><br />\\"Rock of Ages\\" is a homage to the decadence and freedom of Rock-N-Roll. Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) embodies all of the things that defined a generation of rock stars and also make complete fun of it. The movie is fun, hilarious and had a guy like me, who graduated high school the very year that this movie takes place in, grinning throughout, remembering all of it and inside my head, singing along with all the unforgettable songs.<br /><br />\\"Rock of Ages\\" is similar in style to the television show \\"Glee\\", but with all of the seediness and debauchery of an age of music that got lost in the shuffle somewhere.ck-N-Roll.

B005LAII1C|4.0|Seth MacFarlane who became famous for his animated Fox television show \\"Family Guy\\" is making his film debut with \\"Ted\\", a movie about a boy and his teddy bear. How sweet. If you know anything about Seth MacFarlane and \\"Family Guy\\" you know that there is nothing `sweet' about \\"Ted\\", although you may be surprised.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays John Bennett, a Boston kid with no friends. Even the Jewish kid who's getting pummeled by a mob of neighbor kids doesn't want to make friends with him. So when he receives a teddy bear for Christmas (a talking teddy bear with a sweet little, \\"I Love You\\" voice), he has a brand new best friend, but he only wishes that the bear could really talk so they could really be friends. In this movie, wishes come true.<br /><br />\\"Ted\\", the movie, is crass, offensive, rude, obnoxious, gross, sophomoric, disgusting, childish, offensive (did I say that already?) and surprisingly heartfelt. Yes, that's true. The biggest, most surprising thing about \\"Ted\\" is that it has a heart. Somewhere in the midst of all the slosh and rudeness, the movie manages to make you care and feel a real genuine kinship with John and his rude, prostitute hiring, dope smoking, \\"Flash\\" loving, party throwing teddy bear.<br /><br />If you're offended easily, \\"Ted\\" is not for you. It will offend. That's a guarantee. There are no rocks left unturned when it comes to offensiveness. Although, the last two-thirds of the movie changes tone a bit and becomes something different. Oh, it's still offensive at times, but the characters begin to be fleshed out, and the people who enjoyed the first two-thirds, may not enjoy the last one-third as much. They were smart enough to keep some pretty good jokes near the end as well.<br /><br />\\"Ted\\" is not just a movie about a teddy bear and it isn't just a one-gimmick type movie either. The writing is good, although some of the plot twists in the last part of the movie were a little predictable and silly. The jokes are numerous and MacFarlane used every trick he had to keep them rolling from offensiveness, to thinkers, to spoof and then some. Some of the jokes, I thought, were actually really intelligent.<br /><br />I certainly don't recommend this movie to everybody, but if you can take a joke and don't mind no limits joke telling, you will have a great time at the theatre.

B005LAII08|3.0|Other than \\"Prometheus\\", \\"Brave\\" may have been the most mysterious movie of the summer. The trailer reveals a flowing locks, red-headed girl who is being forced to marry the winner of an archery contest to dawn her own bow and arrow, step out onto the archery field and put, not one, but three arrows dead center of the target, splitting the third arrow down the middle. Then of course the words \\"Brave\\" jump to the middle of the screen with a dramatic crescendo of music. So, what is the movie all about?  Well, it's from Pixar, the guys behind \\"Toy Story\\", \\"Cars\\", \\"The Incredibles\\", \\"Up\\", yada yada yada, you get the point and you know their stuff.<br /><br />First and foremost, the movie opens with beautiful \\"Braveheart\\"ish scenery that is done justice by the Pixar team and their abilities continue to dazzle throughout, bringing the characters and situations to life. You expect nothing less from the artists who have done such incredible work in the past and \\"Brave\\" is no exception. Yet, Pixar has set their own bar and we don't go to the movies expecting to be dazzled by them like we were when we saw \\"Toy Story\\" for the first time. We know what they're capable of and we're not surprised by it anymore. Their artistry is commonplace now. So, we need a story and \\"Brave\\" may, or may not have delivered.<br /><br />The movie starts off with what we saw in the trailer and builds upon that. We learn about Princess Merida, voiced by Kelly MacDonald and most importantly Queen Elinor, voiced by Emma Thompson. We learn about their complicated relationship and how tradition is expected of Merida and they both have conflicting views about how Merida should go forward in life. The relationship comes to a head and things happen that I won't delve into and then the movie goes into uncharted territory. Once Merida flees from her life, we start to see where all the mysteriousness leads. We start to see all the things that Pixar kept from us with their extremely vague trailer.<br /><br />I won't delve into that because it was kept from the audience for a reason and I hate ruining movies for people, but what does happen was unexpected and I didn't see it coming. Unfortunately though, underneath all the Pixar animation magic, the story that resides is kind of thin. It is a fairy tale type movie and it never really delves beyond that.

B005LAIHKY|2.0|Tim Burton has made a career off of the `strange and unusual'. In fact, he has rarely strayed from that formula in his entire career. He has made gems like \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", \\"Beetlejuice\\", \\"Batman\\", \\"The Nightmare before Christmas\\", \\"Corpse Bride\\", \\"Ed Wood\\", \\"Sweeney Todd\\", and the list goes on and on. He has also teamed up with Johnny Depp now eight times.  With \\"Dark Shadows\\" he has kept with the `strange and unusual' theme, but the strangest thing about it, is the lack of comedy in the film, despite the trailers obvious comedic tone.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to think about \\"Dark Shadows\\". I have been a huge fan of Tim Burton over the years, but the trailer promoting the film just didn't grab me as funny. I felt like the trailer was trying to be funny, and I found it `strange' and flat. I know now, after watching the film, that my perception and preconceived notion was the correct one.<br /><br />For all I know, the film will enjoy the same camp following as the television show in which it is based upon. In 1966, the television show \\"Dark Shadows\\" debuted on ABC and it was melodramatic, campy and `strange'. The television show was a gothic soap opera and that is exactly what the film is. It centers around Barnabas Collins, a man who unfortunately draws the intense eye of a hired help named Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). He doesn't return her affections and when he falls in love with another. Bouchard, a witch, casts spells that change all of their lives forever.<br /><br />The film has amazing effects and design. Most Burton films do. I was most drawn by the amazing effect they had for the witch as she cracks from time to time like a porcelain doll. It was an amazing effect, and it isn't the only one. The thing about \\"Dark Shadows\\" is that it could have been great. It had the potential to be great, but there were just too many scenes that served no purpose in the film, except to try and be funny and most weren't. The movie jumped from drama to comedy without warning and it never tapped into a single emotion the whole time.<br /><br />I wanted to like it. That's the thing. When you go into a film `wanting' to like it and knowing you're going to like it, and don't. There's something wrong. A better script should have been written.ithout warning and it never tapped into a single emotion the whole time.<br /><br />I wanted to like it. That's the thing.

B005LAIHPY|4.0|Finally, a summer without Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich, but in its place we get Peter Berg's \\"Battleship\\". By the end of this review, I hope to get across that I think that's a good thing. \\"Battleship\\" is big, silly and flawed, but while I say that, it is certainly a worthy addition to the summer blockbuster rollout. It may be facing an uphill battle against \\"The Avengers\\", \\"The Amazing Spiderman\\", \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" and \\"Prometheus\\", but it shouldn't be overlooked as a fun trip to the movies.<br /><br />To make matters worse, \\"Battleship\\" was wedged right between the billion dollar \\"Avengers\\" and another anticipated movie coming out next week, \\"Men in Black 3\\". Yet, what Peter Berg understands about making movies is that people really register with personality and humanity, which \\"Battleship\\" has in spades.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch (John Carter) plays Lieutenant Alex Hopper, a loose cannon, unpredictable, Maverick from \\"Top Gun\\" kind of character. You get the gist of his personality in the very first scene we meet him as he takes going that extra mile for a girl to a whole new level. Brooklyn Decker plays Samantha Shane, a girl who just wants a chicken burrito and Hopper is out to impress. That scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />\\"Battleship\\" knows what it is. It is big and silly. The comedy is frequent and the comedy, for the most part, works. Yet, when the trouble occurs, the creators have done their job and we feel the urgency and peril in their dilemma. As aliens from a similar planet from a distance galaxy explode into our atmosphere, bent on taking over, the trouble grows thick and it grows fast. You feel the overwhelming and seemingly invincible nature of the invaders.<br /><br />Peter Berg knows that people relate to people, not explosions and he puts the comradery and humanity of the navy officers on full display. \\"Battleship\\" isn't trying to be serious. It knows it's big and crazy. A perfect example is the one element of the film where the U.S.S. Missouri, docked for museum purposes, is recommissioned along with the elderly veterans that inhabit it. Still, not only is this an entertaining wrinkle, it is also pretty cool seeing the filmmakers refer to the U.S.S. Missouri as the quality vessel that it is. Not to mention, seeing the elderly veterans talking trash about their battleship.<br /><br />\\"Battleship\\" is a fun movie. It reminded me of \\"Top Gun\\", \\"Hunt for Red October\\", & \\"Crimson Tide\\" with aliens and comedy thrown in. It is a worthy summer movie and I hope that people do go see it, so that Hollywood knows that we like personality, humanity and story with our explosions. I'm bored with Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich type movies. Never once was I bored during \\"Battleship\\".m where the U.S.S.

B008518MOW|4.0|It has been fifteen years since \\"Men in Black\\" surprised audiences with its uniqueness and quirkiness. There were effects that you swore were from Tim Burton and a storyline that we had never seen before. The original is still a must watch kind of movie and probably will always be. Many critics have already said that \\"Men in Black 3\\" is better or equal to the original and some have said just the opposite. Personally, I find this one of my most difficult reviews because they are both right and both wrong.<br /><br />K (Tommy Lee Jones) and J (Will Smith) have been partners for a long time and still don't know much about each other. That seems to be the overriding theme to the movie as K's past comes back to haunt him in a big way. Boris the Animals (Jermaine Clement) has been imprisoned on the moon since an event that occurred on July 18th, 1969 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Anyone who knows American history knows what happened on that date and at that location. It's an event that K has never discussed with J and it's up to the audience to decipher why.<br /><br />\\"Men in Black 3\\" may have the scariest villain of the three movies. His alien traits may be too much for some youngsters. Although he is also, hands down, the most effective villain of the three movies. You feel his dangerousness and you understand why K does as well. Because Boris is such a dangerous and fearful villain, he also changes the mood of the film. That, to me, is the biggest thing to note about \\"MIB3\\". It is a different movie from the other two. \\"MIB3\\" has a more emotional feel to it. It is less chaotic and less happy-go-lucky. The humor is there, don't get me wrong, it is just less.  The movie may be less fun for some viewers, but that isn't to say that what is in its place is bad.<br /><br />J is forced to go back in time at one point during the movie and when he does so, he finds K at the age of 29, this time played by, not Tommy Lee Jones, but Josh Brolin. This is probably one of the most amazing aspects of the film, and it involved no CG or computer f/x.  It involved Brolin doing an impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones. Apparently, the impersonation began during the filming of \\"No Country for Old Men\\" and was perfected before filming \\"MIB3\\". It is the greatest illusion of the film. Brolin nearly backed out of the movie because he didn't think it was good enough, but the final result is outstanding.<br /><br />\\"MIB3\\" is a good movie but the herky-jerky looseness of the first two films is lost and replaced with a more moody film. The emotional connection between the two agents is explored and it makes for, not worse, but a different film in the series. It has been a good summer for movies so far, possibly one of the best ever, and Spiderman, Batman, Snow White and Prometheus have yet to arrive.ing aspects of the film, and it involved no CG or computer f/x.

1606995359|5.0|I have always been a huge Fan of Disney, collecting almost every movie and visiting Disney World eight times with my children. We also ventured out to Disneyland. This is another funny adventure of the miserable, but wealthy Scrooge McDuck. Entertaining, colorful, and laugh-out-loud fun for the children. Also fun-filled for the Big children, like myself. As with all creative Disney movies, this aims to please indeed. Delightful from beginning to end. Highly Entertaining!

0618526412|5.0|The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is one of those books I wish I had read decades ago.  I picked up a copy at a used book sale and was immediately captivated by the five main characters.  The Amazon purchase I made was a gift for a relative, made even before I reached the halfway point of the book.  Service of the seller was excellent, mirroring the themes of the book.
0156027321|4.0|For years I noticed this book on display, particularly its cartoonish paperback cover. Was it a children's book? This Pi stuff -- was it something about math? It's a castaway story and like all castaway and shipwreck stories it's about human endurance, indomitable spirit and man vs. nature. The things that distinguish this story from Robinson Crusoe or Tom Hanks in Cast Away, is that the main character (Pi, short for Piscine) is trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. He's Indian and multi-religious - a true believer in Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. He comes from a family of zookeepers who were transporting their animals by freighter. This is how he wound up with a tiger in his lifeboat. It's an inspiring book, but drags in spots -- more than 200 days at sea is a lot of fish and storm stories. I kept waiting for the multi-religious theme to play a real role in the story but it did so only peripherally, so the plot seems a bit disconnected. In the end, we are offered two stories: one of murder and cannibalism and one of a journey in the lifeboat with animals. A key theme comes at the end of the book in a throwaway line: Which story do you prefer? So it is with God. It's a good read and a unique plot.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|Will Salas (Justin Timberlake): \\"How can you live with yourself watching people die right next to you?\\" Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried): \\"You don't watch. You close your eyes.\\"  Her sentiments about a world in which time is money literally and people \\"time out.\\"<br /><br />It's a decent action movie with a few movie cliches.  Like when Will and his mom are running to meet each other before she \\"times out,\\" then the cliche is repeated again later on as he and Sylvia are running to each other before she \\"times out.\\" My favorite was the James Bond throwback where Will is playing poker. He intro's himself, \\"Salas. Will Salas.\\"  All in all the movie turns into a sort of Bonnie and Clyde story in which Will and Sylvia are robbing banks containing what I guess could be dubbed \\"time capsules.\\"  I believe the movie at its core is an anti-corporatist/antibanker movie as Sylvia's dad is owner of a large national bank and they refer to his time as being stolen time. It's stolen in the sense of taking it from the people to make themselves rich, but giving it out to look like they're not, such as \\"time loans\\" and time printing (inferred, but not seen in practice.)  Also everybody works to gain time and the inflation is referenced as only happening in the \\"ghetto\\" and the idea is to kill the poor people while the rich keep on living. For a couple of hours to spare it's not a bad movie, but does have some sort of anticapitalist/socialist message to it about evil business owners sucking the people dry while we should be freely \\"sharing\\" and redistributing the wealth.\\"  Not exactly my philosophy since I believe in a truly free market (Austrian economics style) regulated only to protect the surrounding environment and people from the abuses of bad business, but it makes for a good story otherwise.

0345803493|4.0|I can't understand the folks that think these are shockingly pornographic. Sexual and erotic..absolutely. I'm one of the 'couldn't put it down once I started reading' folks.  I laugh reading some of the negative reviews because of the statements about the repetition and after reading about how many times Anna bit her lip, rolled her eyes etc., I must say, I see the point and found the numbers amusing but for me it was fantastic.  I've come across people in my life who have simliar habits, some annoying and some enthralling.  For me, everytime Anna bit her lip I got it. It's usually something you're  not aware you're doing, but your inner goddess just takes over.  For those that don't have an inner goddess, tsk tsk.  It makes for a lovely adventure in life.  I've just finished book 2 and am looking forward to book 3.  A literary masterpiece?  No, but an enlightenening escape back to the time when my husband and I first met and couldn't keep our hands off of each other.  If you let yourself relax and enjoy the story - it can remind you of how moments in your life can be if you allow yourself to love deeply.  Love isn't perfect but there are glimpses in time where you can simply exist and laugh deep and hard and honestly from your soul. These books helped me relax and reminded me that sometimes a little fantasy and a lot of trust goes a long way.  I also see the points about teens and young adults getting the wrong impression and thinking this is real life, but from someone who's lived long enough to know how difficult life can be and how short it is...I plan to read the trilogy again and I'm sure I'll enjoy it just as much the 2nd time...
B006RED4GA|2.0|Somewhere buried under a lot of tedium is the basis for a rather gentle and mildly amusing comedy about people running an historic hotel that has seen better days. However..a lot of poorly handled supernatural claptrap has been thickly applied. Early on there was a faint suggestion that it may actually have gotten somewhere..it might even have been an intelligent and creepily atmospheric thriller. It isn't. It's plodding, predictable and lame with a script that appears to have been written by a schoolgirl with an interest in the spooks. Far from being a classic of any kind. It'll leave you cold and feeling cheated and guilty that you spent the better part of two hours on it if indeed you can last that long.

0061339202|3.0|\\"Flow\\" is an interesting research book detailing the manner in which everyone from athletes and performers to authors and scientists reach their peak state of creativity and performance.  Interesting work, and still has relevance 20 years after original publication because it transcends the decades.  However, as with most literary works penned by researchers, it becomes bland and a bit hard to follow at times.  Written like a manual for other scientists rather than for the folks it is trying to help.  Editing with \\"real people\\" in mind would have helped!

B008B3H4VQ|2.0|I loved Linkin Park's 1st two cds, the single What I've Done and two of their Transformer Soundtracks songs.  I thought LP would make a \\"comeback\\" with the cd....I was wrong.<br /><br />After listening to more than half of the samples, I found the songs to be a bit too poppy sounding.  I thought I was listening to a heavy version of *Nsync.<br /><br />I though Linkin Park was one of the better NUMETAL bands that came out in the early 2000's--and were very creative giving us a quality mix of rap-rock with a dash of other musical elements, yet, it seems they have become watered down--And it sounds to me that they are forcing themselves to grind the music out--possibly to meet contract agreements and for desperation for top 10 hits.<br /><br />I think it's time for the band to disband...The luster seems to have faded.<br /><br />Be good to see Mike and Chester go on to other projects.  Hopefully, they won't fail like Serg's solo career after System of a Down....

B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was a real page-turner. The storyline was absolutely brilliant and the author had taken time to insert subtle clues and references recounted later in the book.  The author also slipped in a major surprise twist in the middle, leading most readers to think, \\"Wow. If this is what's happening mid-way, the ending is going to be one heck of a grand finale.\\"<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />Now, I'm trying to write this review without including spoilers, but if you haven't read the book yet, better to stop reading this review now.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT!!****<br /><br />Imagine reading an edge-of-your-seat nail-biter akin to \\"Fatal Attraction\\" or \\"Sleeping with the Enemy,\\" and the storyteller wrapping it all up with \\"...and they lived happily ever after.\\"  Um ... WHAT?!??!  It was/is one of the laziest endings EVER.  What a monumental letdown this was.  Up until the last few pages, I was recommending this book to others.  When I got to the ending, I had to let those same people know what a disappointment it was.<br /><br />One last observation on the author's writing style:  She doesn't seem to know what the word \\"literally\\" means.  However, she uses it often and each time she uses it incorrectly. \\"Literally\\" means in the exact sense and without exaggeration.  For example, \\"It's raining so much it's literally causing local streets flood.\\"  That's the exact sense.  However it's incorrect to say, \\"It's literally raining cats and dogs,\\" unless there are actual animals falling out of the sky.<br /><br />From this book:<br /><br />Page 30:  \\"Their ears were literally pricked.\\"<br /><br />Page 40:  \\"[She] literally shed herself, a pile of skin and soul on the floor ...\\"<br /><br />Page 179: \\"Rand, on the other hand, was literally losing his head.\\"<br /><br />????<br /><br />Sure, I'm not a master of the written word and I'm sure there's a typo or two in this review.  But then again, no one is paying $12.99 a pop to read this.

0385344228|5.0|I don't want to overpraise this book because I don't want others to be disappointed but I can't help myself because DEFENDING JACOB has turned out to be one of the best books I have ever read!  I actually got out of bed last night and sat up reading until 2 AM because I could not stand not knowing how it would turn out.  The last time I did that was with THE GODFATHER by Mario Puzo.  I read this novel in less than 24 hours because I become almost consumed by it, it was that compelling.  For me, every word, every sentence, every chapter was an exercise in readability.  It's hard to pinpoint what genre this novel falls into because it is by turns a thriller, a courtroom drama, a mystery, a family saga...what it is, is great literature.  I simply cannot recommend this book highly enough.  Even if you don't agree that it is one of the best books you've ever read, I'm still sure you will become caught up in it and enjoy it.  DEFENDING JACOB is a reader's delight.

B0052CK5PQ|4.0|Enjoyed! Very funny and entertaining at times. A very frank and enjoyable biography really, think some of the critic reviews I had read built it up somewhat as the new book on feminism for the 21st century which it's not. Would be a good holiday read.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This movie is a shining example of what all Blu-ray sets and re-releases should strive for. The video and sound quality on all movies is amazing. Moreover, the amount of remastering does not take away from the atmosphere of the originals and does not look cheesy like some movies that have been redone. Even better, each disc includes both the remastered version AND the original theatrical release, for those of you that want to see them movie as it was originally released!<br /><br />Also, the set is loaded with special features that are actually worth watching. I'm not a huge fan of special features usually, but we watched them on this disc and were instantly sucked in. The \\"making of\\" videos really add and extra dimension to the movie and really help reinforce what a special piece of film history this series represents. I thought that knowing how they were made would take away from the wonder and horror of the movies, but instead it just reinforced it! The sets for the movies were practically living as they were seen on the screen.<br /><br />If you like any of the Alien movies, BUY THIS SET. This is one of those few times when buying a box set on Blu-ray is worth it even if you already own an older DVD boxed set. Most of the time companies just transfer them on to Blu-ray to make a quick buck from fans who can't resist something because of its title. However, this set is an exception. They put a lot of work into this and tried to make it great, and they succeeded. This set is worth every penny. I really cannot give enough praise. If you're tired of feeling like you're getting taken advantage of by movie companies--this set will restore your faith in home theatre!
B007IQX1G4|5.0|As always, Charlize does a great job of showing us she's one of the best actresses out there. I quickly forgot it was her and started seeing myself in certain scenes and friends in other scenes. This is a great film. It's not a rom-com. It definitely is a wake up call to those who feel their life is perfect and everyone else is lost. Just live!!!

0062068423|2.0|Some parts of this book are ok, but much of it is disjointed and confusing to read. He tries to create suspense but he cuts off at the wrong places he needs to stop trying to be clever. Also there are characters that suddenly pop up and you are left very confused as they aren't introduced properly it is like there are whole parts missing.
1441761268|5.0|There are few times when you find a book that you cannot put down!! I was hooked on \\"Kitchen House\\" from the beginning. It is amazing to see the story line develop and the author does a great job at thoroughly explaining each character and weaving their relationships so seamlessly. I truly felt like I was a part of \\"their world\\" and escaped back to the late 1700's when I was reading this book! I felt as if I came to know Bella, Lavinia, Mama Mae, etc...so well. I love historical fiction, and this is a great book for that- you are learning about slavery and life in the late 1700's, early 1800's, yet it is told in a great story that you cannot help but become attached to! Wonderful story, wonderful book. I just loved it. There were times in this book when I laughed, times when I cried. I am nearly finished and I am trying to read this slowly so I do not finish it too quickly!! I will be sad when it is over. I wish I could find more books like this one!! Bravo!!
B006WAIUEK|4.0|Recently read Welsh's Crime and that was a bit dull. This is very good, Welsh has a good insight into the motivations of people add to that the shock factor and dark humour of the situations the characters are put in.
0307730697|5.0|I just finished the Book Fearless.  This book tells the amazing story of Navy Seal, Adam Brown's life.The story is gripping and the book was hard to put down.  Except for some harsh language I would recommend this book to anyone.  I think it would be especially helpful to those who are struggling to find their path or purpose in life. It would be great for High School students and graduates, college students, those struggling with addictions, those who find themselves in orison, those who feel hopeless, or simply those who are looking for an inspiring story.  I don't want to give away anything in the book but it gives an account of a man who struggles in life with many demons and ultimately shows what Adam is made of.  A man of extraordinary strength, resolve, character, compassion, and craziness and the ultimate sacrifice he is willing to make for his family,friends, and country.
B004I744AS|5.0|I still use an old version of Webster's that has a wonderful dictionary/thesaurus combination, but I had to upgrade my computer to run it with Windows XP on my Windows 7 OS.  This app actually offers so much more, and I find myself turning to it just as often, and possibly more so.
0765316994|4.0|I found out about REDSHIRTS through my father, who mysteriously knew about a book I didn't. Then again, this is the same man who recommended DUNE to me, which turned out to be one of my favorite books of all time, so I shouldn't take his recommendations lightly. My dad is a closet Trekkie, so I know well what a Redshirt is in the world of Star Trek. And everyone knows that the poor Redshirt dies. This book is about that phenomena, and it's wildly hilarious, but there is just something missing...<br /><br />REDSHIRTS follows Andy Dahl, recently assigned to the starship Intrepid. Dahl quickly begins to realize that there is something peculiar about the ship's away missions - the captain, the science officer, and other select crew members always live even despite apparently insurmountable odds while the poor ensign (or more) dies. But the truth about this strange phenomenon is stranger than the phenomenon itself.<br /><br />This is a laugh-out-loud type of book. In fact, for me, most of its laurels rest on the fact that it is a comedic book for geeks who have seen a few too many episodes of Star Trek. The poor Redshirt who is never really mentioned will be the first to die while Kirk and Spock and McCoy will randomly live even though they should be very, very dead. This entire story is cemented around one concept which is innately full of humor, and for the most part, it manages to carry the novel - even as the story takes a very strange, unexpected turn and becomes a very philosophical story.<br /><br />Oh, and it's very meta.<br /><br />The characters are quite enjoyable, as is the plot. The writing is serviceable enough, although it was a bit disjointed and could have used some polish. It came off a bit dry, to be honest. Unbelievable. The transitions are awkward and the characters, while enjoyable as I said, do not have much substance. We know little about them, their personalities, and after awhile several began to blend together. For example, Hanson for me was just there. I don't know anything about him after finishing the story. Even Dahl was somewhat dull. He was a priest in an alien religion, but that is the extent of what we find out about him really.<br /><br />The ending, as well, left me wanting more, but the laughter from the earlier parts made up for some of the slow parts.<br /><br />REDSHIRTS will appeal, in my opinion, mostly to geeks and nerds who are familiar with science fiction television. If you are not a geek, I think a lot of the nuances will go past you, since this one has a lot to do with science fiction television - in more ways than the synopsis will tell you. But be prepared for rather dry story to get to the buckets and buckets of laughs.<br /><br />VERDICT: Extremely humorous but belayed by a rather dry writing style, REDSHIRTS is one of those ultimate geek novels - it won't appeal to everyone, but to those who enjoy science fiction, it will be quite enjoyable.st there.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|Very different format of writing and a very enjoyable story. The story was fictional yet had history woven through the whole book.
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Rya Gosling hit the mark with this character, and the music really makes you feel a part of this movie. Slow build to any real action, but you need that to understand his character. People saying otherwise don't understand the depths of his character: he is the movie, the movie is him.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is off the roof. I think you will be intertaned.If I where you I would bye this app.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|First off I am going to start by saying, please judge this on the music and not on someone's past mistakes. Everyone has done something in their life that they would like to move on from. It doesn't help when you have people steady bringing it up in their faces all the time when they doing their best to change. So, before you judge someone, just remember that at the end of the day, you are no better than anybody else. I am sure you have mess up at one point or another in your life.<br /><br />*This is a really good album once you have given it a few listens. My only problem with this album is the cursing. I don't like cursing so that is kinda my only complaint.*<br /><br />Now getting on to the songs (This Is What I Feel When I Hear Them)<br /><br />1) Turn Up The Music - Now I will admit when I first heard this song, it didn't really grab me and I wasn't too crazy about it. However, once I heard the remix, I immediately fell in love with it, and love both versions since. This is a great high energy dance track. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />2) Bassline - To me, this is more of the \\"Look AT Me Now\\" track of the record. I think this should be a single. It has a sick robotic sound to it which is great. It also has a cool kinda cocky vibe to it, which is fun to play around with every once in a while. (I'm not saying I like cocky records really, but if you can make it fun and not that annoyingly type cocky then it is alright with me) 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />3)Till I Die - Featuring Big Sean & Wiz Khalifa. This is one of the few songs I don't really like on this record. The only reason why I gave it a 2 out of 5 stars is because, I like Chris' background vocals on it. I love the way he sings the words \\"I'm High\\". He's sounds incredible singing it. Other than that it just sounds like a song that has a whole bunch of cursing in it for no reason. Not impress. (Really no need for cursing. Please get rid of the bad language for good.) 2/5 *stars*<br /><br />4) Mirage - Featuring Nas.This is a great song. Chris & Nas do a great job on it. The beat has a great 90s feel to it which makes it sound more natural and real. I think the song samples the beat \\"Waterfalls\\" by TLC, and it sorta has a semi angry vibe about it. I think this should also be a single. I am sure it would definitely blow up the charts, and radio. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />5) Don't Judge Me - A beautiful ballad. The lyrics and meaning are very deep. I would love to hear more stuff like this from him often. (This is real music) 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />6) 2012 - A very sensual/sexy ballad, about making love like it's the end of the world. A little too deep in detail but I will let it sly this time. The music and Chris' vocals are very mellow and relaxing. I'm sure all the ladies will love it when they hear it. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />7) Biggest Fan - This is another great song. I love the vocals in this song. It's about his \\"biggest fan\\". I love the music and beat in it. One of my favorites, a great feel good vibe to it. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />8) Sweet Love - This was one of the singles I like immediately when I first heard it. He samples \\"Freak Me Baby\\" by Silk. It reminds me of the way he sang his song \\"Yo (Excuse Me Miss)\\" from his first album \\"Chris Brown\\" just in terms of vocal styling, which capture my heart and made me fall in love with his music. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />9) Strip - Anybody recognizes this song from his fourth mix-tape called \\"Boy In Detention.\\"  It is a upbeat fun club sing along song about seeing a person strip and very fun to dance to. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />10) Stuck On Stupid - It is a great ballad about being in love. It has a latin sorta type beat and feel to it. Another one of my favorites from the album. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />11) 4 Years Old - Another great lyrical heartfelt ballad, that again I would like for him to do more of. It's basically like a reflection of himself talking about having everything and still not being completely happy. 5/5 *stars*<br/><br />12) Party Hard/Cadillac (Interlude)- Featuring Sevyn. This is a really cool pop mellow type ballad about seeing/liking this person for the first, and wanting to be with them. Cadillac (Interlude)featuring Sevyn is like a cool acapella 60's type doo wop feel record that shows off both Chris & Sevyn's vocals. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />13)Don't Wake Me Up - It is a very fun pop upbeat song. He teams up once again with Benny Benassi (Beauitful People from the album F.A.M.E.) & also Free School & William Orbit. I'm sure this song gets the club jumping when it comes on. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />14) Trumpet Lights - Probably the strangest song on this album, but in a good way strange. It has a dubstep type beat/feel to it. It reminds me of a song that be played at wedding receptions called \\"It's Time For The Perculator\\" (I believe). The more I have listen to this song the more I have grown to like it. I give it 5 out of 5 stars for creativity and it being something out there. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />15) Tell Somebody - It's a great 90s type old school R&B ballad to me. I can see this being played on the radio a lot. I love the vocals in this. Also hearing Chris sing along to it on Ustream was a plus. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />16) Free Run - A great ballad with strong vocals on it. Also great meaningful lyrics, and very relaxing. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />17) Remember My Name - It's a cool pop song, but it's not a track that really grabs me. It is probably the filler on the album to me. 4/5 *stars*<br /><br />18) Wait For You - A great track about \\"waiting\\" which we don't hear too much about anymore since Janet Jackson's \\"Let's Wait Awhile.\\" So kudos, it's very creative especially coming from a guy. 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />19) Touch Me - I love the vocals and music in this song. It's a very sensual ballad, plus you get Chris talking on it which he doesn't really do. It has a Prince type feel to it to me. (I consider this sorta like the sequel/follow to \\"Wait For You\\" for some reason) 5/5 *stars*<br /><br />Overall this is a really good album. As a whole, I will rate it 5 *stars* because it is really a solid decent record.
B000068FUS|5.0|Most of the reviews will give you an idea of what this is like and how good it is. As Rolling Stone says a modern (well reasonably modern) classic. You can pick a few tracks or just sit down and listen to it straight from start to finish and soak it up. Although I am from Australia I can just feel the genuineness that southern rock exudes. These guys have it in spades and should be more greatly recognised. But then that's the music business - dross gets the $ and the fame.
B0002EXH54|5.0|This is one of the best thrash metal albulms ever Megadeth is one of the best bands ever. They are my 3rd favorite out of the big four but I strongly like every band in the big four. Any way if you like classical Thrash Metal than you will love this it is remastered but that dosen't make it any less good. That is What it is called ReMastered Thank you for reading this review and hope you found it helpful.
B0001FGBD4|4.0|Have recently acquired a DVD player that is also a SACD player and so I am exploring and buying a few SACDs to see what they can sound like. Although I am not necessarily a big jazz head this is pretty good and the 3rd track \\"The Real Blues\\" by the Ray Brown Trio is worth the price of admission on its own - hits me where I live as I am a blues fan. The CONCORD Jazz SACD Sampler Volume 1 is also pretty good on the basis of the reviews I have seen but why is it so expensive?? C'mon CONCORD if it's that good make a few more copies of Volume 1 available.
B002JYPV3G|5.0|This albulm is by a band that is just awesome they are a nu-metal band but man Can Corey Taylor Scream. This is awesome Combination of nu-Metal,Heavy Metal,and Death Metal it is all just awesome. The Drumming is just so fast loud and in you face The Vocals are awesome and everything else is just awesome if you call yourself a slipknot fan and don't have this albulm then you are missing out big time so if you like Slipknot this is a must have. Especially since you get a DVD and some other tracks you don't get on the regalur cd. Thank you for reading this review and I hope you found it helpful.
0756407125|5.0|I read The Name of the Wind a few years back and thought it was superb. I ordered both that book and The Wise Man's Fear a few weeks back to reacquaint myself with everything...<br /><br />And I couldn't be happier. I started to read other reviews of this book and was slightly dismayed - did I miss something? While I agree there are many loose ends, and Rothfuss will be hard pressed to get this all wrapped up in one more book, what do I care? Take two, take three more?!! The writing is phenomenal, and I was struggling to keep my eyes open to read more.<br /><br />The stage is set for some fantastic revelations, tragedies, and twists that twist and twist back again. Could I nitpick? Sure. But much of the problem dealing with revelation in the storyline deals with the fact it has been told entirely from one point of view, albeit from two different time frames. Bast or the Chronicler have now come in as a point of view - but that's it and very rarely. For Kvothe to speculate looking back would be odd and take a bit of the surprise out of everything.<br /><br />Keep it up, I'll buy the next one. Or two...
B001BGTWXI|5.0|This cd is one of the best cds ever they combine nu-Metal and Heavy Metal to make a very good albulm with fast songs and slow songs. The songs that are the best on this albulm are Psychosocial,Snuff,Sulfer,and Butchers Hook those are my favorite songs on this albulm overall this albulm is great there isn't one song on this albulm That I don't like. Most people think that slipknot sold out after subliminel verses 3 but look at the freakin cd there is an explicit content sticker on it when you get it. In my oponion Subliminel verses 3 is a really great albulm with only two sucky songs. So I would reccomend this to any slipknot fan that has stayed with slipknot but is not a Maggot because Maggots like any thing slipknot has and that is just crazy. How can you like a song that you have never heard that is absolute bull crap. Thank you for reading this review and I hope it persuaded you to buy this albulm.
1423136802|5.0|My son was really into Percy Jackson.  Sometimes he reads through a book in a day, other times it takes him a couple of weeks to make it through a book.  If he gets interested in a series, I always try and stay one book ahead of him so when he's ready, the book is waiting for him.  The boxed set made it easy to stay on top of his reading.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|If you like metal then this albulm then this is for you it is not anything close to death metal but it is a very good albulm. First off the best song is almost easy if you haven't heard it then you better hear it if you like Avenged Sevenfold. The worst song on this albulm is a little piece of heaven I just think that The song is crazy and not that good but it is ok. So buy this if you Avenged Sevenfold or Metal period you won't be dissapointed also another good albulm to check out by them is city of Evil all songs on that are awesome.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was Gran Torino starring Clint Eastwood. This one came from the 5-dollar rack at Wall-Mart and was quite a good movie. Of course, I've always liked Clint Eastwood and have a big collection of his movies. In this movie, Eastwood appeared quite old. He played a veteran of the Korean War, and his true age is just about right for the part.<br /><br />Eastwood lived in a decaying part of an older big city. His wife had died and he was now all alone. Most of the original residents of his neighborhood were gone and the new wave of people were mostly Asian. Some Hmung people lived next door, much to his dislike, and the area was plagued with gangs. The \\"Gran Torino\\" of the title was for an aging but very-well-kept-up 1972 Pontiac he had stored in his garage. The car was coveted by some of the young hoods of the neighborhood. Eastwood was the old Eastwood and had a few guns and issued a few Eastwood-type threats that kept the hoods at a distance.<br /><br />Eastwood was an aging curmudgeon and angry with seemingly everything in the modern world. Several times he helped the next door family out of threatening situations, for which they were very pleased, and they gradually and grudgingly became friends. Eastwood befriended the young boy and trained him and helped him to get a construction job. It was an uplifting story, probably played over and over in modern America, and well worth watching. Everything about the movie was first rate, but I'd expect that with an Eastwood movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Well, I have read 4 of the 5 books of \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" and the video version of \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is  just as bloody and raw and awesome as the book. There are some details that were not too much to my liking, but then, you have to compress things for public viewing; otherwise it would be about 20 hours long. This version has Blu-Ray only, no DVD or Digital download, which is just fine for me, since it carries the complete guide. This feature is an absolute plus!!! (Get it if you can) It connects characters with locations and histories; it has little clips on all these, voiced by the actors in character! (The one by Viserys was chilling.)<br />One last thing.<br />Tyrion, Tyrion, rah rah rah!  (yes, I belong to the few, the proud, the fans of The Imp)<br />Jean
0307341577|2.0|I loved Flynn's new novel, \\"Gone Girl\\" and so I was eager to read something else by her. I picked up \\"Dark Places\\" and, while it is entertaining and well written, there are many flaws to it as well.  For starters,the characters are just awful. Great writing includes the ability to develop eccentric and unlikeable characters but the reader should be pulled along because of the sympathy the author is creating at the same time.  Flynn doesn't seem to do that in this novel. She seems to be constantly reminding the reader how disgusting and unpleasant these people and their lives are.  The ending is also a let down.  Too many contrived coincidences but I won't say anymore, as most of the fun in this book is getting to the end.  Also, I wouldn't recommend this book unless you like descriptions of lots of gratuitous animal cruelty. I had to skip pages and pages of it. Very violent and unnecessarily sensational.  There is no doubt that the author is talented, but this book doesn't make the cut.
B008BYXQJY|4.0|I listened to this album for the first time yesterday and was completely happy with it.  There wasn't a single song that didn't have me dancing in my seat (inappropriate at Starbucks).  Levine's voice carries Overexposed as it has on all Maroon 5's other albums.  I wish I'd paid a bit more attention when I purchased, as I could have had the deluxe edition for the same price, so I've had to download the 3 bonus songs for another $3.  I haven't listened to them yet, but I'm pretty confident I'll like them just as much.  Maybe this album isn't as artistic as past albums for Maroon 5 have been, but it's fun and gets you moving nonetheless.  I gave it 4 stars mostly for the fact that, with 2 versions of the album, I feel a bit cheated to have to pay more to get the rest of the songs.  Why not just one version and be done with it?
B004R5YXRA|4.0|It would seem fitting for David Sedaris to narrate his own life story, but I find myself annoyed from time to time with how he reads it. Like he's complaining about everything. Maybe he is, but it's not fun to listen to.<br /><br />But I can ignore it and laugh at the hillarious stories.
030758836X|5.0|GONE GIRL deserves 5 stars primarily because it wears so many hats at once: page-turning suspense thriller, razor-sharp social commentary, and an unflinching analysis of the peaks and valleys of marriage.  This book is the rare intersection of chart-topping fiction and actual literature.  It is the perfect summer read, digestible in several days (you won't be able to pace yourself) AND feels like a book you will never forget.  The hundreds of other reviews should give a sense of the basic story, which starts precisely on July 5, 2012 - the day I finished this masterpiece.  Commentary on plot-specific points is too risky to spoil any one of the numerous roller-coaster twists and turns in the plot - suffice it to say this book is NOT a one-trick pony that some one can solve or predict halfway through.  Instead, the plot develops much like a real relationship might - learning some ugly truths about two spouses, Amy and Nick, little by little, with both actual and figurative puzzles being posed and solved as you go - the perfect analog to the novel's main point: you are likely to feel the most intense feelings - infatuation, despair, attraction, resentment, bonding, and contempt - all at once - for the same person in your life - whether it's a spouse, a partner, a sibling, a parent, or a friend (or one of each as life progresses).  The alternating narrators and initially-disparate timelines were not distracting - this mechanism is often employed clumsily by authors, but Gillian Flynn hits it like a tuning fork - each shift in voice and time felt like a long-awaited drink of water quenching the reader's thirst.  The two main characters are anything but cliche (and to those critics who dismissed the diary from the opening section as 'teenage' in voice - I think you missed a major plot point) - you will laugh and cringe about aspects of both husband and wife as their respective stories and perspectives unfold.  The author certainly doesn't pull her punches when addressingintimacy - and it's so refreshing to read something that is neither majestically Elizabethan nor cliche-James Bond-cool when it comes to the bedroom (the analysis of \\"The Cool Girl\\" could have stood as an award-winning essay all by itself) - the author lends a very credible voice to the inner thinking of both genders on the most taboo of topics - without anything seeming gratuitous, since so much of the novel is devoted to the mental chess game being played out between husband and wife over years.  Yet above all of this excellent \\"thought process\\" analysis - pages and pages of compelling reflections on life's mundane yet essential issues - is the main event - a ticking time bomb of confrontation, suspense, mystery, and drama - making the book as addictive as it is fulfilling, with flashbacks enriching the characters (or, at least, their points of view - which serve as a literary musical chairs game as the novel progresses).  The reviews that characterize this novel as a \\"whodunit\\" do a disservice - GONE GIRL is far more complicated - and you will have that answer long before the last page - this novel isn't meant to be solved, like the 6-books-a-year-will-he-find-the-bomb-or-solve-the-code \\"thrillers\\" we see cranked out - instead, GONE GIRL is meant to be savored - I found myself reading parts over and over even before I was finished - sometimes because a second pass of a certain clue (there IS literally a puzzle being solved for much of the book - but it's presented so authentically, and ingrained in the plot, that it doesn't feel contrived) provided a completely different meaning - and sometimes because re-reading Amy or Nick's perspective on some issue or memory provides new depth the second time through - rather than hanging her hat on some artificially constructed solution, the author seeds GONE GIRL with dozens of trip wires, some of which will detonate long after you first walked past them - collectively providing a very satisfying read.  Some reviews criticized the ending as a letdown - I respectfully think those readers missed the main point of the novel - this is NOT simply a crime thriller, anymore than marriage is simply a ceremony and honeymoon - the novel, like the institution of marriage that it examines - deals (often with purposeful hyperbole) with the yet-unanswered question of \\"What do we do with each other when the cheering stops?\\"  GONE GIRL provides a better analysis of the highs and lows, and aspirations and regrets, that are a behind-the-scenes fixture to every marriage than most non-fiction marital advice books do - and without seeming preachy, or one-sided, tackles the issues of how childhood and parenthood and temptation and familiarity collectively rain a lifelong meteor shower down on every couple to strain the fabric of love-everlasting.  Again, no punches pulled when it comes to calling out the endless ways couples negligently (or purposely) drift from the highest emotional highs to the grumbling, time-wearied lows - if your head is not spinning from the twists and turns of the main plot, it will certainly be as you read the mental twists and turns that each spouse offers on the topic of what makes a relationship work, and what kills it (figuratively or otherwise).  GONE GIRL deserves the praise used for Amy's fictional offshoot (read the book) and Amy's working title for a manuscript - \\"Amazing\\" -  I loved the book from cover to cover, both as a suspenseful mystery to be solved, and a wide-ranging examination of the engine of marriage to be considered.

B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Fantastic, gifted musician!!! Enjoying my CD!!!The music is great!! A person could enrich their lives with his music; his singing!!Dancing and exercising; doing housework!!Fantastic!!Very enjoyable.
0439023513|5.0|The product was in amazing condition for brand new! It looked like i had gone out to the book store and bought it myself!  And for like half the price it was an amazing steal!<br />The person who sent it was very thorough as well.  It came on the exact day it said it would and i was able to track the package as it went through the shipping process.  There is nothing bad i have to say in this review. There was no damage when the package came, and i have already started reading it.<br />Thank you for such an easy process to getting my book!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book is really badly written.  It is the porno version of twilight.  The storyline (what little there is) is terrible, has no substance. I do not recommend this book at anyone.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angary birds games because. you can play. it. any where for exgample. like on the train and on the bus. and on the airplane.
B007SGM084|5.0|One of the best stories ever. A lot of twists and turns to it.  I am reading it for the 2nd time.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|This is definitely a must buy! As a big team breezy member, I obviously found this album great and definitely worth it. A lot of the songs took us back to the old R n B Chris Brown which is why we started loving him in the first place. This album will win a Grammy and go platinum in no time at all.
0060775858|1.0|This book is somehow unsettling and very boring at the same time.  I'm not sure where all the hype came from but this is the least favorite of mine among my seven month old's book collection.  He doesn't much like it either -- looks away and actually shuts it or squirms out of my lap after a few pages.
B0064X79JC|2.0|I was very disappointed with this book.  Maybe because I saw the movie first I had an idea of the structure, but I was quite wrong.  I've never read a book that skipped back and forth without any semblance of time.  It was almost impossible to determine when things were happening.  I was baffled from one chapter to the next.  I made the mistake of not looking in my local library first.  I made sure I did that with James Sallis's other novel \\"Driven.\\"
B006RED4GA|2.0|Just finished Innkeeper... Well it never really amounted to much. It is slow to start and didn't take advantage of any of the truly interesting possible story points. I would reccomend this movie for a bunch of 12 year old girls looking for a slumber party bubble gum thriller.the whole movie likened itself to standing in front of a dark bathroom mirror and repeating bloody Mary the end result is about the same, A waste of time with nothing to show for it.
0345803485|3.0|Whoa. That was something else. I exhaled, returned to this planet.<br /><br />I laid the book on an end table and reflected for all of two seconds on the wisdom of what I was about to do. As usual, the other organ besides my brain that occasionally ingests large volumes of blood won out. Indeed, it was good and ingested right now. Heck, it was worth a try. I turned over on my side towards the lump under the sheets next to me.<br /><br />\\"Hey, babe, wanna try some, uh, kinky sex?\\" I said, trying to sound nonchalant.<br /><br />Lump rotated slightly towards me, lifting two hands, a pencil and a crossword puzzle into view. \\"Sure. What's a six letter word for a bench on which a rower sits? Starts with `t'. \\" she said.<br /><br />\\"Thwart,\\" I said.<br />\\"Ah. Thanks,\\" she said, pencil scratching.<br />\\"That's apparently what you're doing to me.\\"<br />The pencil stopped moving. \\"What?\\"<br />\\"You're thwarting me. Thwarting my intentions. You said yes but you mean no.\\"<br />\\"I said yes?\\"<br />\\"Yes. `Sure', to be verbatim.  I read that as yes.\\"<br />\\"I did? Said yes to what?\\"<br />\\"To kinky sex.\\"<br /><br />She digested, then said \\"You're right. I mean no.\\" At that, she began waving her pencil over the puzzle again, but soon dropped it on her end table and turned on her side towards me. She raised her head and looked past me at the book on my end table.<br /><br />\\"You've been reading Fifty Shades of Grey again, haven't you?\\" she said, piqued but not angry.<br />\\"Uh, yeah.\\"<br />\\"How is it?\\"<br />\\"Actually, it got kinda cute about the time I didn't expect it.\\"<br />\\"Cute? It's about dominant and submissive sex, isn't it? And bondage, egad. How can that be cute?\\"<br /><br />I sighed, feeling my feel-good-ingestion lurking unseen under the sheet like the Loch Ness Monster slip sliding into past tense. \\"Well, yeah, except she's not really submissive, just naïve. And he's a perfect control freak gentleman when they're not in his Red Room of Pain.\\"<br /><br />My wife rolls her eyes.<br /><br />\\"That's what turns him on,\\" I said. \\"When she rolls her eyes, like you just did, after he says something ludicrous like . . . like `You must use my private jet to commute six blocks to work. It's safer. I can't bear to lose you, Ana.' \\".<br /><br />\\"He has a jet?\\"<br /><br />\\"He's a billionaire. At age 26. Sort of a Mark Zuckerberg, but incredibly handsome, saving the world while the money rolls in. But he's never working. He's too busy stalking her, buying her stuff, e-mailing her. And when they're not e-mailing each other, they're . . . well, you know, they're . . . doing it . . . a lot.\\" He's a sex expert. Practice makes perfect. He has the finest, er, tools. And toys. Yeah, don't forget the toys.\\"<br /><br />\\"And what's she got?\\"<br />\\"She orgasms at the drop of a hat.\\"<br />\\"I see. \\" Her eyes unfocus for a moment. \\"Is this some sort of reflection on me?\\"<br /><br />I squirm, hoping to avoid foot-in-mouth disease. \\"Oh, no, babe. It's a reflection on . . . me, not you. Like him, it's my job to make sure you, uh, enjoy the moment . . . as well. \\"<br /><br />\\"Uh huh,\\" she says, unconvinced.<br />\\"It's just that I thought that maybe a little variety would be . . . good.\\"<br />\\"Variety. What kind of variety do you have in mind?\\" She sounds interested, I think. I hope.<br />\\"Well, I don't know,\\" I lie. \\"Maybe you could read the book.\\"<br />She raises up and peers at the book again, lying there innocently.<br />When I get up to pee hours later, her reading light is still on.
0156034565|5.0|I just cannot say how much I loved this book! Not only did it make me laugh until tears ran down my face, it is also a glorious satire of self-serving, hypocritical politicians.<br /><br />Dr Alfred Jones is a meek, hen-pecked scientist with a particular interest in the life-cycle of the caddis fly. He works at the National Centre for Fisheries Excellence, a department of DEFRA. When a fabulously wealthy Yemeni sheik with a passion for salmon fishing is ready to invest vast sums of money into establishing salmon fishing in his own arid country for the spiritual benefit of his countrymen, the British government, keen to improve relations with the Yemen, instruct the department to prepare a feasibility study for the project.<br /><br />Faced with the impossibility of making the unfeasible feasible, Dr Jones is offered an alternative: the loss of his job. Terrified of his scornful wife who is carving herself a career in the world of finance, he buckles down and decides to find a way to make the project work, and eventually convinces himself that it's possible.<br /><br />Stocks of fish are earmarked for export - drawing the fury of anglers and animal rights groups, while the gentle, religious Sheik is targeted for assassination by Al Qaeda because salmon fishing is anti-Islamic. Busily designing transportation and holding tanks and overseeing building works in dry and dusty Wadi Aleyn, Dr Jones develops a friendship with Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, the Sheik's agent. He can't help comparing fragrant, pretty, fun-loving Harriet with dour, ball-breaking, workaholic Mary. But Harriet has her own problems as her fiancé, a soldier, is missing behind enemy lines in Iran.<br /><br />The British Prime Minster and his slimy spin-doctor wobble like weed in a strong current as they twist and turn to squeeze every potential advantage from the situation whilst simultaneously covering their backs should the project go wrong.<br /><br />Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is my idea of a perfect read. It's beautifully written, hysterically funny, very poignant, and a great story with an unexpected ending. And I learned a useful new word: Anadromous. Definitely an all-time favourite. Thank you, Paul Torday for a wonderful book.<br /><br />I haven't seen the film, and don't plan to, because I believe that the exquisite subtleties that make this book so special can only be conveyed by the written word.
B006X96PF6|3.0|I recently picked up Troubadours On the Rhine from my local library. I can honestly say that I am glad I didn't spend money on this live album. I do love that Troubadours On the Rhine has a live, intimate quality to the sound but does the public really need another live album from Loreena McKennitt? IMHO I don't think so. I love Loreena's voice and the talents of Brian Hughes and Caroline Lavelle however I feel like she needs to put a moratorium on the live albums. It just seems unnecessary but if she insists on putting live albums I wish she would be daring and chose lesser known songs. I hope the next album she puts out is an album with new material.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I did not care for this book, another controlling and possessive lead male in a novel.  I\\"m really sick of these types in books I read.  How about a woman with a backbone that kicks these d-bags to the curb and finds a male equal? Oh well.  That being said, it was a quick read with a minor random subplot in the middle of the book that took away from the flow of the novel.  I almost didn't finish it because of this.  It's a fast read, and if you like your men controlling and your women sloppy drunks maybe you'll go for it.
B001HN6EF4|2.0|My wife bought these for the pool.  Good concept but very durable.  The finish is already wearing off after one use in the pool.  Probably from rubbing on the deck outside the pool.  Plus our 2 year old grabbed the whole deck of cards and threw in the water and they all sank to the 6ft deep end near the pool drains.  Overall not a great product.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Made it through 2/3's of the first book ... I'm done.  Please don't bother.  It's poorly written, utterly unbelievable, and disturbing on so many levels.<br /><br />Seriously, don't waste your time.
B006O6F932|1.0|I purchased this dollhouse a week ago.  I paid $125.00 for it, and it's now $79.00.<br />If I could I would return it immediately.  It is very flimsy and seems to be made of cardboard.<br />I got it for my BFF's 5 year old daughter, and she hasn't been able to play with it.<br />None of the parts stay together, the stairway falls down, the floors are so flimsy the<br />furniture won't stand up.  My recommendation is don't buy it, especially for the<br />money I paid.<br />I felt so bad that it can't be played with.... so we made our own out of a cardboard box<br />and decorated it.  She has gotten way way way  more enjoyment from that!!!<br />What a waste of money.  :(
0593055810|5.0|Amazing combination of fact n fiction. I loved it. Bravo Dan brown. Movie is ok but the book is great
B007SGM084|5.0|this is the best trilogy i've read in awhile!  addictive!  page turner!  just couldnt put it down!  now im at a loss.. dont know what to read next!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I read the first book because everyone and their mother was talking about it.  It was ok. I thought maybe the second book would get better and it just got worse. This book is irritating on so many levels.  Here are some of the worst aspects of the book:<br /><br />1. She writes like a 5th grader yet uses words like \\"petulant\\" unnecessarily.  She does this over and over.  I really think she had a thesaurus next to her when she was writing.<br />2. Ana still thinks she's not very pretty and needs to just shut up about it.  This girl has no self esteem and it gets really annoying.<br />3. I don't even want to know how many times Ana says or thinks \\"jeez\\"<br />4. Her stupid subconscious and that inner diva or whatever it is continue to be irksome.  Did that bother you that I used irksome instead of something normal like \\"annoying\\"?  See point number 1 and don't read this book.<br /><br />I get that the draw are the sex scenes or whatever, but there needs to be some kind of plot and there isn't.  I only finished it because I had already paid for it.<br /><br />With all of that said E.L. James is laughing at all of us on the way to the bank.
B0086700CM|4.0|I'm glad thy put temple run on the kindle its just that it freezes. too much lil it always messes me up I still love it :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book. It was a very intensest read. It kept my up into the wee hours of the morning couldn't put the book down. Lots of emotions in this one you laugh, you cry, you will go OMG. and you will think about it after your done reading it. I bought it on my e-reader then when I finished it I bought the paperback books for my collection because I know I will be reading it again soon.

B005AKFXZW|5.0|Reading this book was a joy.<br /><br />There are short stories that manage to maintain a gentle, lyrical sense of magic.  I love them and have often wondered how one might go about transferring that mood to an entire book.  Morgensten has done so.<br /><br />The book is not told in linear narrative.  There are brief interludes, and the narrative shifts backwards and forwards in time.  For this book and this story, it works very well.  Each chapter keeps its sense of magic, a dreamlike feeling.  The story feels like a collaborative effort made by the individuals contained in the story - I particularly like the fragments of newspaper articles written by one of the reveurs and placed throughout.  And I did not mind the second person chapters, where I, the reader, was literally invited into the circus.<br /><br />It is so wonderful to hear hype about a book and discover it is justified.  This lady can write - and write very well.  I wonder what on earth she will come up with next.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|The movie has language options which came useful in a recent training for teachers in Mexico - The teachers and other trainers loved the movie as it depicts Temple's life experiences with autism and how she came to be an advocate and internationally known speaker.  Loved the movie!
0062082353|4.0|I found this book a quick and enjoyable read. You won't learn how to be a sniper here but you will see a bit of what it takes to become a Navy Seal and what that \\"lifestyle\\" entails. Having served in the military in the '80s, I found the modern combat techniques quite interesting. The real question is how do you come back to regular society after shooting people every day for a living for so many years? The author seems to have handled it but does talk a bit about how it changes you. Not overly gory, this is worth a read if you enjoy combat recollections.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|\\"Everything in the room screamed that I didn't belong.\\"<br /><br />I devour this book in less then 24 hours it is an amazing read. A story that not only shows us the nice and caring side of love but also the messy and dark side of being in love.<br /><br />With amazing character Jamie McGuire takes us on a countless emotion ride that fallows abby and Travis on they're way to fall in love
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is extremely addicting! I love it. Some games are more difficult than others but they are all really fun.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|\\"Cheap CGI\\"...\\"Bad acting\\"...etc<br />Are these people watching the same movie?<br /><br />\\"Cheap CGI\\"  -  The computer graphics are excellent.  As good as or better than any other film.<br /><br />\\"Bad acting\\" - First of all, no one is expecting an Oscar performance in a sci-fi action flick, but the acting is fine.  Lynn Collins shines.<br /><br />\\"Incomprehensible plot\\" - It does require you to think.  If you're not used to doing that while watching a movie, you're in trouble.<br /><br />\\"No chemistry\\" - Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris oozes chemistry.  Any red-blooded earthman or blue-blooded barsooman would ooze back.<br /><br />Five Stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|Its a ton of fun. A lot of my friends have this game and I thought they were crazy because I saw them playing it all the time but no that I got this game I cant stop playing it on the plus side its free

B0054JZC6E|5.0|i think this app is fun for all ages. it has alot of really cool games. i really recomend it.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Absolutely love this book! I agree with the comment about the poor editing, but it's still a worthwhile buy.  I'm studying to be a personal trainer and have found the workout progressions fantastic.  I have done a fair bit of training in my time, but I can honestly say I've never been so sore 2 days after a workout as I was with these exercises.  Love that you can do them anywhere too.. invaluable tool for anyone wanting to get in shape.
B007SGM084|5.0|The first book is a little slow, but definitely picks up in the second and third. Held my attention the entire time-couldn't put it down! Highly recommend!
B007VLHP9K|5.0|Only wonder why it had taken so long. Unglaublich! But better than never.<br /><br />Had known these videos for a long time. The seventh and eighth, especially, are transcendental. Can't wait to grasp a copy!
B007SGM084|5.0|I found this trilogy to be so captivating that I am already rereading the books.  The author keeps the stories moving so all three books are page turners.  I recommend this series.
0345803485|5.0|I am almost done with reading this book,and it is really good. I ordered book 2 and it just arrived a few days ago. I am very pleased with how the shipping process is too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best books EVER!! Would recommend to all ladies and even men! Buy them all at once for a slight deal
B000068FY0|5.0|Considering it's based on a loose concept album theme............it's about as perfect an album as you can get.No wasted space or filler here, just great songs that are well written, well played and well produced. A stellar album in every sense of the word. I am BLOODY WELL RIGHT !
B0083GQKQG|4.0|My teenage daughter & I watched this movie together. We both really enjoyed it. I love Tilda Swinton- she does some intense movies. I do not like blood, but this movie is more pyshological than blood & guts.  Go see this movie...
030758836X|5.0|Like most people on this site I read a ton. Because of this, I am pretty quick to spot where a plot is going, because it is so difficult to come up with a plot that goes somewhere new. In Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn has created a plot that kept me off balance in a very exciting way. Just when I though I knew where this was going, what the motivations of the characters were or what they planned to do, Flynn decided to choose a different path.<br />In addition to an exciting and unique plot, Flynn also offers some of the smartest writing that I have seen anywhere about relationships between men and women. One character's discussion on pages 222-225 about the Cool Girl is perfectly describes a suspicion that I have had for ages, but was unable to articulate as perfectly as Flynn.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves mysteries or who wants to explore the complicated, and sometimes painful, ways in which relationships can function.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its a fun game!But its way to SLOW.on the kindle fire.So it doesn't really work on a aneroid either.So it kinda sucked-_-:/
B0000069CT|5.0|Great sound and artistry. Bruch was a true master.<br /><br />This double cd is fantastic and should be in every classical collection! These 3 violin concertos are fantastic! The other works on the cd's are such an added bonus!! I listen to them more than the concertos!!!  $9.81 total delivered to my mailbox.<br /><br />Well worth the price except (as usual) this was another Phillps double cd that did not allow both cd's to be ripped onto my computers. As one disc rips, it rips over the other disc already ripped onto my computer.<br /><br />Good day friends !
B005IQZB14|4.0|I'm quite shocked at so many \\"angry\\" reviews about this book and questioning of Cheryl's character.  This book really intrigued me and I was all consumed in reading every word she spoke, every emotion she felt, every step she took, and every pain she felt. She endured a lot and we all don't make the right decisions in life, such as evident with this author's story.  This book is much deeper and includes depths that the readers who didn't quite understand this book or didn't like this book couldn't quite understand.  Some people who read the book are missing the DIVINE intervention that was meant for Ms. Strayed (now married, differnt last name) but there are beautifully profound quotes from this book that gave me chills. The most profound one for me that I will take forever throughout my life is ...\\"Fear, to a great extent, is born of a story we tell ourselves, and so I chose to tell myself a different story from the one women are told.  I decided I was safe.  I was strong. I was brave.\\"  This journey from lost to found was really touching and such a treat to read. I hope that readers will choose for themselves, the journey on the PCT with Cheryl was riveting at best.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|ok but I would rather you be able to change the Color of the battery thing I think its good that its free
B006LSZECO|5.0|Nick and Amy Dunne seem like the perfect couple until Amy goes missing on their 5th anniversary. Told in the alternating voices of Nick and Amy, the story twists and turns with mind-bending quickness that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page! Loved it!
0307959856|2.0|It is a truth universally acknowledged that imitations may be the sincerest form of flattery but they rarely live up to the originals. In the case of Death Comes to Pemberly, I suspect that Baroness James enjoyed writing this book considerably more than I enjoyed reading it.<br />P D James is obviously an Austen fan, and she works very hard to re-create the atmosphere and the style that Austen lovers revere. However, this is supposed to be a mystery, and the leisurely style and florid prose of the early nineteenth century do not suit, especially when it is further confounded by so many names of characters that the reader REALLY needs a Cast of Characters list to keep them straight, especially if it has been a few years since reading the earlier exploits of the Bennets and Darcys.<br />I confess I did not finish the book, so I cannot comment on the plot, which was almost non-existent up to the place where I stopped reading. Maybe it would have improved, but after 25% of the book is dull I'll move on to something more promising. Too many books and too little time to bother with the ones I am not enjoying.
B0086700CM|4.0|ever time die or mess up u just want to try it again and again and again personally I like it
B004XJHBCE|4.0|Much higher lag on the Amazon Appstore version than on the Google Play version.  It probably has to do with the license check.  I'm guessing it pings back to Amazon every time you click on the shortcut/widget making it slooooow.<br /><br />Not a bad app.  The best of its kind.Slower than others but better organized.<br /><br />It could do with a more updates look and feel for the folders though.  Currently there is no way to skin them.<br /><br />grade: B
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I ordered this book for my Kindle only because I heard so much about it.  And I wanted to hate it.  I didn't.  I enjoyed it to the point that i couln't put it down.  And immediately ordered the second book.  Christian is such a complex character as is Ana, which makes it a compelling read.  I had to put book two down only because I needed to go to work!  I look forward to finishing it and digging into the 3rd installment.
034580404X|5.0|I read these in less than a week. Loved the main characters, both were very strong. I will reread these again.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|So I read a lot of the other reviews about this Office Suite before I bought it. I waited until it was 99cents. So some of the complaints have been fixed: You can connect to google docs. You can save files on your android device and it will not be \\"lost.\\"<br /><br />However, it is true this is not the most recent version. When you try and update the software it will bring you to their website where you have to pay 14.99$ to get the additional features. So for 99 cents you are getting a limited but still functioning version of Office6. The newest one is 6.10 on their web site. The 99 cent version is 6.1.861. So it is obviously older. But again you get what you pay for. It edits word etc. So for my use it is fine. 5 stars would have been if they sold the fully functional updated version. 4 stars would have been if it was missing only a few features and the version was closer to 6.10 and not 6.1. So I give it 3 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so good. you should get it. its really really fun!! it works perfectly fine on kindle.awesome awesome awesome!!!
B004EPYZUS|4.0|A good action film from the series mission impossible.  Thou i have most of the series, because i like action movies, mission impossible movies are just ok for me, thou they do have some good action sequences.
1568363931|5.0|Used this every day since I got it. The recipes are easy to understand, especially for a Westerner getting acquainted with Asian terminology and cooking methods. Don't let the size of the book fool you; every nook and cranny has some kind of recipe on it. Excellent advice for first-timers as well as some good favorites. I'm never moving anywhere without this book.
0345803507|5.0|An overall great book/series...a must read for all women! Once you start the series, it will be difficult to stop. Enjoy and happy reading!
B005K17RU0|5.0|bar none this is the best weather app out there. highly recommended for tgw accuracy ease of use and stylings.
0345803485|5.0|Now I know why this book has become a best seller.  Read this and see for yourself.<br />I was left hanging after the first of the trilogy and immediately ordered the next 2<br />books in the series.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I purchased this movie for my 4 year old niece, who loves and adores Ariel.  Since watching the film, she has taken to leaning against large rocks (imitating Ariel when the ocean splashes up behind her as she poses on a rock), and singing to her toys.<br /><br />When I purchased the DVD, it was less than $15 (on amazon), at the time of this writing, the price has skyrocketed above $50.<br /><br />Another bonus, in addition to the added material contained on the disks, is the removal of the \\"Phallic Symbol\\" on the underwater castle, and the \\"questionable accents\\" on the pants of the priest who performs the wedding ceremony between The Prince and Ursula.<br /><br />It should be a crime to deny a child access to this wonderful story filled with beautiful songs and vivid imagery.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great Book!!! It is a must read!!! Once you start reading it, you will not want to put it down. It is very addicting.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it was a great game and the only reason I'm doing this is tomake some points for free. I pesonaly like the game because u can make your own city from the ground up
0312427565|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long to read this book. Now I can't put it down. I am a pilot and read a lot of aviation literature, and think this some of the best. The story is fascinating and Tom Wolfe is a wonderful writer.
B000FC2O48|3.0|\\"Ubik\\" started out promising. It was an interesting premise for a story that I found intriguing. Unfortunately, after reading several chapters, I became disinterested. I basically didn't care about what happened to any of the characters involved (even though I found the plot mildly clever).<br /><br />If you are a person who wants to identify with, and feel an emotional connection to the main characters' lives, I wouldn't recommend this book to you. But, if you are a person who prefers twists and turns in a plot instead, you'll probably enjoy this story.
B0063TX06I|5.0|MAIN COURSE is my favorite Bee Gees album.  The 1975 release captures the trio's strongest assets---their smoothly crafted melodies, polished musical arrangements and the tight vocal harmonies.<br />MAIN COURSE contains some of their finest work and Arif Mardin's production is flawless.  Three hit singles catapulted the album to the top of the charts; the singles did well also:  their #1 smash JIVE TALKIN, the tune that foreshadowed their disco success; the top ten NIGHTS ON BROADWAY, one of their best songs from its infectious synth-bass opening to its tempo-changing break and Barry's incredible falsetto; the melodic and inventive FANNY BE TENDER WITH OUR LOVE was a top 20 hit.  The remaining tracks are vintage BG magic:  the smooth beauty of BABY AS YOU TURN AWAY, a truly melodic gem; the playful Beatles-esque of ALL THAT MAKIN LOVE; the simple beauty of COUNTRY LANES, COME ON OVER and SONGBIRD; the perfect pop euphoria of WIND OF CHANGE and EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE.<br />The passing of Maurice and Robin may have brought the brothers to an end, but they have the legacy of four decades of incredibly good recordings!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. In fact, after I read it I couldn't get enough and reread it. Read it twice in two days.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I read the Burroughs' Mars stories when I was a boy. Therefore, I already had a good idea what the story was about. I can see why the critics gave so-so reviews and why audiences found it hard to follow. In a similar situation to \\"2001, a Space Odyssey\\", if you had not previously read the book, you may have found some of it hard to understand. Other than that, I considered it well done and good family fare from Disney. It is a shame a little more attention was not given to drawing the audience's attention to what was happening and why, because there probably will be no sequels. As with the \\"Tarzan\\" series, Edgar Rice Burroughs did a good job on the Mars stories and they make good family fare. I would have enjoyed further movies of the series. Of course, maybe the swashbuckling days of sword play and the Buck Rogers/Flash Gordon type of science fiction is lost on the younger generations, even with all the special effects. If so, then I'm afraid that Robin Hood and Knights in shining armor are also on their way out. What a pity. Still, \\"Pirates Of the Caribbean\\" seemed to survive. I thoroughly enjoyed, and always will, the tales of Barsoom.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved the storyline in this book.  It was great.  I couldn't put it down.  And, when I finished with the 1st book, I just HAD to get the next one to see what had happened.  Same thing with the 3rd book.  Thank you, E. L. James for a great story.  Looking forward to reading more books from you.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|I have been a rabid fan of the Aliens series for decades. I've devoured every Aliens (and Predator) game, movie, comic book, and novel that has been released pretty much for the last twenty years, and while somewhat let down by the AVP 1 movie and almost completely let down by the AVP 2 movie, I knew that if Ridley Scott was directing a new movie that was a prequel to Alien, it would be great.<br /><br />And it was. This movie had the huge epic feeling you only get from truly great science fiction; the LV-223 approach scene, the Prometheus in space (it's the name of the ship in the movie), all the locations on the alien planet, and just everything about the movie was so well done and so polished. I went to see it twice in the theater in the same week, which is something I very rarely do, and usually when I do that the second time I see the movie my enjoyment of it is diminished a little bit or I find a few cracks or flaws in it - but not with Prometheus - I enjoyed it even more the second time.<br /><br />So now for the geek details, by category of things I care about seeing in an Aliens film:<br /><br />Xenomorphology (alien life): Absolutely killer. I am refraining from spoilers here but let me tell you that every form of alien life you see in this movie really does seem that - alien. As it should be. More than anything else, I am interested in the alien lifeforms and alien ecology in the Aliens universe, and Scott did an awesome job of introducing some new creatures to the mythology without corrupting anything else already in place - which is saying a lot.<br /><br />Action: No, this is not a movie involving the Colonial Marines, and no this is not, per se, a purely action movie, so you do not have any scenes with handfuls of Aliens swarming soldiers carrying automatic weaponry - because this is hundreds of years before the Colonial Marines even existed, anyway. This movie is instead a SCIENCE FICTION movie - not an Action/Sci-Fi movie or a Sci-Fi/Action movie. It's a film about the most realistic possible depiction of exactly what could possibly happen when we finally encounter alien life.<br /><br />Acting: Despite some others' opinion to the contrary, I felt that the acting in this movie was perfect. Not kind of great, but perfect - spot on. Especially the second time I watched it, I was repeatedly struck by how interesting of a web of relationships and interactions all the characters had with each other. I found all the characters believable and interesting. On that note, Michael Fassbender as David was literally mind-blowingly good. I found myself actually sympathizing with him more often than some of the human protagonists. And Noomi Rapace as the female lead was stunningly good.<br /><br />Feeling of Immersion / 3D: Absolute. I saw not a single molecule of anything in the film that detracted from my immersion in its universe. In fact, I had to remind myself to actually move around at several points throughout the film (both times I watched it) because I would realize that I had been sitting perfectly still doing nothing but watching. And the 3-D, a gimmick which I have almost universally despised in movies since the new 3D DLP technology came out a few years ago because most of the time directors use it as an excuse to throw in multiple \\"someone is jabbing something in your face, LOOK, HERE'S THE 3-D EFFECT!\\" scenes, was actually very subtle for the most part - which made it extremely effective.<br /><br />Storyline: I thought the storyline was great. Some have complained about it, but I didn't find any flaws in it. I think something needs to be said here; I have noticed many of the detractors are saying that the plot had holes in it; that there was \\"no explanation\\" for one or more of the things that happened during the movie (trying to leave out spoilers here, so I can't be more specific). To those people, I would say \\"Then don't watch a science fiction movie. Watch one that has no fantasy or sci fi elements to it.\\"The entire reason I watch, and, I suspect, many people watch, science fiction is to experience an ALTERNATE reality - one in which fantastic things happen that we let ourselves be carried away by and immersed in. NOT one that we audit mercilessly, picking apart each scene or possibility until we find something we can qualify as a flaw which then somehow unravels the entire movie. And besides, I'm an expert at noticing plot holes, flaws, and badly conceived storylines in movies - they jump out at me like a sore thumb - and I did not detect a single one in Prometheus. Yes, I know that great science fiction usually involves things that are scientifically possible although out at the far edge of possibility - and this movie had just that.<br /><br />Faithfulness to the Universe: A lot of people know everything about the Star Wars universe, or the Star Trek universe; I happen to know a lot about both but neither are my personal choice for \\"Science Fiction Mythology of First Choice.\\" The Aliens universe is my first choice. Scott did such an incredible job of creating an amazing film set within that universe bursting with new ideas and new creatures without violating a single piece of the existing universe. Purists will call \\"foul\\" at this point, extracting examples from the Aliens Vs Predator movies here of how Prometheus doesn't match precisely with the version of the universe depicted in those movies, but....honestly the AVP films were pretty bad, regardless, and Ridley Scott and Giger invented the Aliens universe - so I think Scott has free license to basically ignore the AVP universe if he wants to.<br /><br />Answers & Archives: I was very happy with the way that Scott worked in much of the material that HR Giger originally developed for the first Alien movie but they were not able to use at the time due to budget constraints. If you look at the portfolios of art that Giger did back in the late 70's for Alien, much of what is in Prometheus was actually visualized then by Giger, and it's great to see a director fulfilling Giger's vision on film in an Aliens movie. It was exactly what I wanted to see, and Scott did it perfectly.<br /><br />Series Continuity / Fit with Existing Aliens Films: The entire thing is a brilliantly directed, wonderfully executed Part 1 of the prequel series to Alien. And a word on that; don't forget this is only ONE of TWO Alien prequels that Scott has planned. For anyone not understanding how this movie links up to Alien after they've seen it, don't forget that Scott never planned to answer all the questions in this movie that link up to Alien - there is still another entire movie worth of things that has to happen before we will come up to the doomed crew of the Nostromo, timeline-wise.<br /><br />Conclusion: I rarely buy movies anymore, because I almost never want to watch them more than once - but I'll be pre-ordering the most content-heavy version of this movie I can. I'd recommend it quite highly to anybody.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have spent countless hours in the gym with very little to show for it. I always thought I was a \\"hard gainer\\" and oh well. I've read a bunch, but incorporating the new reading didn't seem to help. I recently completed some months of the Insanity work out and that was good. But I still didn't feel like I was making the gains I should.<br />I am very happy with Mike's book. I'm a scientist, so I understand what people say about maybe things should be referenced more. But I disagree. You can find a reference for pretty much anything philosophy you want to espouse. What I wanted is one person's philosophy on how to look good. And there is one suggestion in the book that is different than everything I have been told for thirty years in the gym, and I think that change will make all the difference. I don't want to give away much in the book, you should buy it, but Mike talks about exercise, nutrition and rest and how important each is. And there are some novel ideas here, at least novel to me.  I'm a couple weeks into the program, so it's too early to tell much.<br />Maybe I'll report back after a couple months with the program. But if you are considering buying the book, I would strongly suggest you do. A bunch of the other reviews mention that Mike will email you back if you contact him. It's amazing.<br /><br />I think Mike combines a lot of knowledge and experience, maybe stuff a lot of people would agree about, with some novel ideas.<br /><br />UPDATE: One year into program, July 2013<br />This book blows away all my other investments in gyms, gym equipment, books, in short, every investment, on how to exercise. It's been a year now on Mike's program. And at 50 years old, my best year ever as far as making gains in muscle and how I look. I travel a lot for work, so that interrupts my training, but even with that, I am seeing great results. I just spent $75 on Mike's personalized diet. And I suspect that is going to be a great investment also. Starting on that dietprompted me to write this update. In my review above, I say that there was one big difference in what Mike has you do, I think I was wrong about that. He has several really important differences in how he has you train. I am NOT going to be one of those reviewers who spells out what is in the book. You should invest $15 in your body and buy it. I do NOT agree with those who say this is not new information. To me it was, and I have worked with personal trainers and read books about gaining muscle. Plus I am really happy that I have been completely injury free-if you don't pay attention, you will think Mike's program emphasizes heavy weight, fewer reps. But if you read carefully, he has you do a warm up for each muscle group, that has you using less weight. And I think that has been a subtle but very important feature of the program. And that because of what Mike's philosophy, which includes focusing on just a couple muscle groups a day, I don't have to spend hours in the gym each day.<br /><br />In conclusion, incredible program. Mike has brought together a lot of great information together here.

0486284735|5.0|I must say I never imagined I would enjoy reading a 19th century romance, but it turns out that 'Pride and Prejudice' is an easy, pleasant and surprisingly engaging read. The story is set in rural England of early 19th century and is centered around Elizabeth, second daughter of the Bennets, and her evolving relationship with 'proud' Mr Darcy. The author has done an excellent job keeping the pace of the story, while painting excellent character portraits.<br /><br />--<br /><br />A minor note:<br />Some people observe that the name of the county where the military regiment is settled appears as \\"----shire\\" throughout the book. Strange as that may seem, it is not a typographical error; it is actually how it appears in the original (you can check the free online editions of the novel on Project Gutenberg or Google Books). According to an annotated version by David M. Shapard, that was done in purpose by the author to avoid naming a particular county, although the reason is not known for certain.

0307592731|1.0|This is not one of those times where the hype ruined it for me because I picked it up before Oprah selected it for her book club and I went into it with a completely open mind. BUT...it was a complete fail for me.<br /><br />After losing her mother to cancer and divorcing what seemed like the most supportive husband ever, Strayed decides to hike the Pacific Crest Trail. The idea comes to her after seeing a book on the subject and since she doesn't seem to have anything else going for her, why not? She is essentially homeless as she can't figure out where she wants to settle down and without a job to tie her down, the decision is easy. She's in her mid-twenties and healthy, it can't possibly be that hard, right?<br /><br />It's not unheard of for a non-hiker to hike a trail like this one. Lots of people find closure and peace of mind on the trail. Stripping yourself down to the bare essentials, pain and hunger all have their place in clearing away the cobwebs so Strayed's decision to hike the trail, was not that unusual. However, I expected her story to be about her coming to terms with her mother's death. After all, that is why she set out for the trail in the first place. Instead, what I got is a silly book about a woman who is just a little too full of herself.<br /><br />Here are just a few reasons why this book falls into the ridiculous category:<br /><br />The contents of her pack included an entire package of condoms. Really?<br /><br />Her decision to hike alone. Really not safe and in fact, stupid.<br /><br />Her care packages to herself  included sexy lingerie for her potential hook-ups with strange men. Okay, she said it was for her to feel good but when you pack an entire box of condoms you've got to to wonder.<br /><br />The possibility of sex on the trail is of great concern to her. Not her shredded feet or the lack of boots that fit.<br /><br />The actual sex that takes place and her getting a kick out of being able to attract smelly men on the trail. Ick.<br /><br />Ahem, the drug use. She was a hard-core heroin user before the trip and if my memory is correct, manages to find drugs at least once while taking a break from the trail.<br /><br />Clearly, there was not enough hiking and true self discovery for me to take this book seriously. It veered off into numerous directions and although I felt for her at the beginning of her story, I had lost all respect for her by the end of the book. The writing is choppy and I didn't care for her self-absorbed nature. Every thought seemed to turn towards sex or the possibility of sex or had something to do with her looks. I got tired of it. You are hiking and haven't showered in days. How can you be concerned with your looks? Seems like more important things should have been a concern.<br /><br />I can't recommend this one. It's not what it's described to be. I don't feel that she really got the closure she needed and it angers me to see it flying off the shelves just because Oprah picked it for her club.<br /><br />Trust me, it's not all that.Ick.<br /><br />Ahem, the drug use.

B00499QUK2|5.0|It would ordinarily be hard to say what the best part of this 'update' of Sherlock Holmes is; the title character is played well and thoughtfully, Lestrade is a thoroughly professional conventional detective, and the supporting characters are engaging without being distracting.  However, the most surprising and impressive element of 'Sherlock' is easy to point out: the character and acting for Doctor Watson.  The character development is outstanding, and the understated acting is genius.  The series emphasizes Watson's contributions to Holmes' detection and managing of his weaknesses, reminding us of why Conan-Doyle wrote of a team.

044655667X|5.0|Not that there's anything wrong with reading century-old literature - in fact, there's a lot right with it - but after reading a string of books that were all ninety years old or more, I figured it was time to have a little change-of-pace and read a recently written book.  Who better to break the pattern with than Michael Connelly, one of the most consistently good mystery writers around?<br /><br />Which led me to The Fifth Witness, the fourth in Connelly's books about Mickey Haller, the Lincoln Lawyer, so nicknamed because he used that particular car as his office.  In this book, however, Mickey finally moves into a regular office as he takes on a high-profile murder case.<br /><br />Prior to getting this case, Mickey is just squeaking by, doing foreclosure cases.  One of his clients, Lisa Trammel, has just gone from worrying about losing her home to a much bigger problem:  she's accused of killing a banker associated with her foreclosure.  Mickey's an adept lawyer, but it won't be an easy case, as the evidence pointing to her guilt is pretty heavy; his only hope is to make it look like a frame-up, always a dicey strategy.<br /><br />Compared with narratives from one hundred years back, this story focuses more on action than description and a little more on character and less on plot.  Therefore, even as the main murder case goes on, we get to see the private side of Mickey's life, particularly with his second ex-wife (and still occasional lover) Maggie.<br /><br />In short, this is another great book by Connelly, sure to please both new and old fans.  As for the title, I won't say who it refers to, but it's actually more of a pun than a literal phrase.

0385341679|5.0|I have read the Fever series since it came out and patiently awaited this book and can say that I felt it was worth it. This book seemed much longer than the others, and she wrapped up quite a few loose ends nicely which I like. It did seem that compared to the other books this was jam packed full of information about all the characters. I really wish that she had spread it out just a little, maybe put some of the information into the previous book or something, it was a little overwhelming after the pace of the other books. However, I can't complain about getting character details. I wasn't left wanting which isn't always the case with the \\"last book\\" of a series. She did leave a pretty good opening to continue and I know she is putting out some graphic novels, which I have yet to read. Overall I loved the series and this book specifically and even if I never read any more of the story I felt like it was a pretty good ending.
1451627289|5.0|*A Brief Note to Readers: If you find this review \\"not helpful\\", please take a moment to tell me why in the comment section. Thank you.*<br /><br />After almost half a century, the assassination of John F. Kennedy still fascinates the public more than any other event in American history.  But what if it could be undone?  What would the world have been like if Kennedy had survived?  With \\"11/22/63\\", Stephen King harnesses that fascination and answers those questions by weaving history with fantasy and does so in such a way that a reader's mind will be reeling from the possibilities and consequences of time travel and the attempt to change history.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that the concept for this novel sat idle for almost forty years.  When King began writing it in 1972 (a mere nine years after Kennedy's death), he shelved it after a time, claiming that \\"the wound was still too fresh\\" and that he was still too green as a writer for such a complicated story.  All that creative fermentation and the opportunity to perfect his craft set him up for an even richer story once he went back to it.<br /><br />But it also set him up for some painstaking research. King took great care to portray 1950's and 1960's life with unerring accuracy, including trends in simple forms (such as cars, household products, fashions, music, dance, etc.) as well as abstract (racism, moral convention, small town mentalities).  He also got to know his landscape, traveling to Dallas, TX on several occasions and touring the infamous School Book Depository and one of Lee Harvey Oswald's former residences.<br /><br />His execution of the central plot is spellbinding.  He makes every word count, his narrative uncomplicated, efficient, and full of purpose and occasional humor.  The story moves along expeditiously despite its length (842 pages) and its forays into a few subplots.  Though some of his stories of this ilk can get a little self-indulgent (his first draft manuscript for \\"Under The Dome\\" weighed 19 lbs), \\"11/22/63\\" gets a pardon because every one of its characters, even the most minor players, are fascinating.<br /><br />But it is the love story he includes that is absolutely exquisite.  Readers of King's work know that he doesn't do lavish and lacy metaphor when it comes to passion.  The love affair between his protagonist and a woman with whom he inadvertently crosses paths is understated, clear-cut, and powerful.  Those who are skeptical about his ability to write a moving love story will more than likely be the ones who find themselves teary-eyed at the book's conclusion.  Despite stirring love stories in previous novels (e.g. Bag of Bones), the coupling of Jake and Sadie Dunhill outshines them all.<br /><br />\\"11/22/63\\" differs from most of King's catalog in that it is historical fiction with a sci-fi twist.  Readers who don't care for the horror genre but still want to give King a try will greatly enjoy this.  Highly recommended.e\\" weighed 19 lbs), \\"11/22/63\\" gets a pardon because every one of its characters, even the most minor players, are fascinating.<br /><br />But it is the love story he includes that is absolutely exquisite.

B0084IG7KC|1.0|I really disliked this movie I tried to get into it but I could not. All my friends told me it was an amazing movie filled with action and adventure with a bit of romance. To me it was very lame and corny on all aspects...they tried going for this holocaust feel in the beginning to make you feel sympathetic for the people living there but you won't give a damn. Because this story wants you to give a damn for Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence)she is humble, tough, and passionate. I really liked her it's as far the only thing I liked was this girl she is a great actress that fits this role perfectly.<br /><br />Unfortunately that's as far as it will go for me...later she volunteers for her sister for not making her go. Another boy get's picked up Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and they go prepare for a gladiator fight with other people in other districts. The fight begins in the island and it goes on but WOOOOOW the action sequences were terrible in this film they went for the shaky cam effect and zooming in on almost everything. It practically kills it that there's no suspense and thrills that it bores me.<br /><br />I felt this movie was more intended for the teenage girl crowd as there was a hint of Team Peeta and Team Gale going on. I just couldn't take it anymore it needed to have an adult theme not a kids love story -___-. After the dissapointment I went on and read that this was a complete rip-off of Battle Royale. I happen to catch it on Netflix and wow Battle Royale was by far a grittier and brutal presentation of action and great characters that develop as the film goes on. It was far more superior and thrilling than this pile of garbage.<br /><br />I even heard that the other books were garbage in the franchise and Hunger Games was the only good one. How on earth are these writers going to try to make a good movie on bad books? It is going to be very interesting to see the outcome. I guess I saw a different movie than the rest of the fans going crazy on \\"What a masterpiece and incredible piece of film this is!!\\". Pffft please this movie was not worth the price of an admission ticket it's a rental at best.\\"What a masterpiece and incredible piece of film this is!!\\".

B007Y6OZE0|4.0|The Offsprings' new album is actually quite good because it has what you would expect from them, the fast opening punk rock track, \\"The Future is Now\\", which leads into \\"Secrets From the Underground\\" and what I think is reminiscent of the Smash album sound: \\"Turning Into You\\".<br /><br />The album has a joke song, which is not bad, but after a while it's not something you will really find yourself going back to. Thereafter, it takes a turn for the worse for a few songs, with generic drumming (which is sadly a bit of a problem in this album - if only they would re-instate Ron Welty).<br /><br />Terrible, to say the least, is \\"OC Guns\\" (why it even made the cut I don't know), along with a re-recorded song \\"Dirty Magic.\\" This is a bit lazy on the band's part--new material would have been better. However, others may agree that this works well on the album.<br /><br />Before you know it, the album closes with energetic \\"Slim Pickin's\\" so whilst it's not their most consistent like their last release: \\"Rise & Fall\\" but still a very good follow-up and still enjoyable. Though I think most would debate that \\"Smash\\" is their most consistent for an overall comparison.

B000001FFJ|5.0|After a decade of stylistic drift -- singer-songwriter, Beatnik wannabe, heartbroken crooner, booze-soaked bluesman -- Waits radically changed his sound with \\"Swordfishtrombones\\" in 1983. As good as that album was, \\"Raindogs,\\" released in 1985, is its vindication. All of Waits' styles are on display here, with his clattering Harry-Partch-meets-Kurt-Weill-in-Hell sound providing the unifying thread. The variety and range are dazzling. \\"Downtown Train,\\" the disc's key cut, has been covered by every manner of singer, yet it remains Waits' property. There isn't a bad cut on this album, and many of the songs are Waits mainstays, if not outright classics.

B0041KKYGU|3.0|Kind of lame, but I did like the arch humor between Diaz and her ex-boyfriend, Justin Timberlake. When they dry-hump here, you know they knew that people would find that titilating. But Diaz is getting a little older now, and she is not  as hot as she once was. But Timberlake just keeps looking younger, absurdly so, in this film. The non-stop expletives uttered in the wrong locales are a big part of what humor this movie relies upon. I thought it was funny, but not everyone will get the jokes here.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|First book on Kindle-  WOW-  Computers-Laptops-The way Music is marketed-Movies-Phones.  Steve Jobs was a World Leader in transforming us to the Information Age.

A \\"must Read\\" for everybody who is moving from the Industrial Age to the Information World.
B004Y1USV2|2.0|In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, \\"star stuff\\" \\"galaxies\\" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?<br /><br />I regret to say this, but \\"Fly From Here\\" sounds like Starcastle.  It's Yes Light.<br /><br />I'm glad they're still out there, working on new material.  But this is simply not a CD I will be spinning again in preference to almost any other Yes album I possess.<br /><br />This is for one of two listeners:  either the Yes Completist, or someone who is not acquainted with Yes, but who enjoys light, fluffy, spacey, extended pop.<br /><br />Just not a great album IMO.

145162445X|2.0|This book was unexpectedly disappointing. As a non-scientist who reads extensively about cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, I wasn't surprised that the author spent the first 142 pages of his book rehashing what we know so far about the formation and evolution of our universe and its component structures. Some of the information is quite recent, and I expected the foundational knowledge to be important to understanding the argument and evidence that would presumably follow.    Unfortunately, I was fairly well stunned (and disappointed) that he then blithely extrapolated one known phenomenon into a wildly different context with barely an acknowledgement of how different it is, and then declared victory in a ridiculous and unnecessary argument with theists.    It is true that we know from recent experiments that what we long thought of as \\"empty space\\" beyond the edges of our solar system is not \\"nothing.\\" Even places in deep outer space that are truly empty of any dust or molecules are still physical structures that are capable of holding matter - similar to how an empty shoe box is still a physical box.    We all know that shoe boxes are made from cardboard, and we now know that space itself is made of a seething sub-microscopic \\"quantum foam\\" that contains vast amounts of energy and strangeness. (See [...])    Quantum mechanics also tells us that inside this quantum foam, at the tiniest microscopic level, all sorts of particles and anti-particles are constantly winking into and out of existence. The author describes on page 154 that under the right circumstances, two charged plates can be brought close enough together such that a \\"real particle-antiparticle pair can \\"pop\\" out of the vacuum, with the negative charge heading toward the positive plate and the positive charge toward the negative one.\\"    As crazy as this sounds, we know from Einstein's famous equation that energy and mass are essentially interchangeable. They are different manifestations of the same thing, and under the right circumstances (such as nuclear fusion), we can convert matter into huge amounts of pure energy such as nuclear weapons.    These same principles suggest it is entirely reasonable for energy to turn into particles (mass), and the author presents a compelling case of how the math works out fine when an equal balance of particles and antiparticles pop into existence, because they represent zero net energy. (Imagine having two bank accounts with zero balances and then electronically transferring one dollar from one account to the other. Suddenly one account has one dollar and the other account has a negative balance of one dollar.)    Unfortunately, this is where the author makes a leap of faith that I simply can't follow. He concludes that because it is probable (or even certain) that miniscule quantum particles and antiparticles pop in and out of existence inside our spacetime, it must follow that it is possible or probable that the same thing happens outside of spacetime - in a manner that allows for the creation of a quantity of spacetime that is so huge as to be literally mind-boggling.    (Our Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 300 billion stars, and is so vast that it would take a rocket ship (traveling 500 miles per hour) more than 147 billion years just to cross the Milky Way. And our galaxy is one of more than one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.)    After making the case that it is possible for universes to pop into existence so long as they have zero total energy, the author completely fails to explain why our universe seems to have far more matter than antimatter. I was expecting him to say there must be vast amounts of antimatter beyond our view , but he instead provided a head-scratching explanation of how the imbalance could have come to be - without addressing the fact that such an imbalance flies in the face of everything he postulated about the primacy of zero energy systems.    Near the end of the book the author unintentionally shows how weak his arguments are when he comes right out and claims that it is a \\"fact\\" that \\"in quantum gravity, universes can and indeed always will spontaneously appear from nothing.\\" It may be true that this is so in some version of the speculative (and unquestionably incomplete) theory of quantum gravity. But it certainly is not a fact and the author's presentation of it as one is emblematic of the sloppy reasoning found throughout his book.    Finally, a grudging word about the book's discussion of religion. I am embarrassed for everyone that a book dedicated to exploring cosmology and scientific principles spends so much time pointing out how the overwhelming huge mountain of scientific facts (based on easily repeatable experiments) conflicts with the mix of inconsistent ancient myths that comprise monotheistic religions.    From my perspective, \\"religion versus science\\" isn't a conversation worth having because religion brings nothing testable to the table. Religion isn't even the equivalent of a spoon at a knife fight.  It is more like claiming a cupcake is a great life preserver while living in the desert, far from water.    I would have greatly preferred that the author split this book into three books. One being his robust and excellent discussion of modern cosmology, the second being a more logical explanation of his theory of nothingness, and the third being a scientific evisceration of the myths of theistic religions.  Having read the book the author wrote, however, it is clear to me now that he (and/or his publishing company) intended to pick a fight with religion in order to generate buzz, controversy, and sell more books.    He should have spent more time explaining and defending his central theory, and laying out the case for the next generation of scientific experiments that we should perform in order to prove or disprove his theory.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This album is a great example of \\"aging gracefully.\\"  The musicianship is stellar -- just what we've seen from Eddie and Alex at their musical best.  Son Wolfgang has some serious chops.  This sounds like classic VH without any feeling of trudging through old territory.  The cuts feel like missing (but good) tracks from albums like \\"Diver Down,\\" \\"Fair Warning,\\" and \\"Women and Children First.\\"  Only they're brand new.  None of these songs come across as recycled hits from the past.  It's really wonderful.<br /><br />At least THREE of these songs come straight off the band's DEMO REEL from 1977 or thereabouts -- that surprised me.  These are \\"She's the Woman,\\" \\"Big River,\\" and \\"Beats Workin\\".  Perhaps I have missed others.<br /><br />But what really gets my attention (in a very very good way) on this CD is David Lee Roth's lyrics, which are mature and thoughtful without sacrificing any of his silly, glib, fun-lovingness.  And in the three songs mentioned above, you get a window into how Roth works.  Though the musical arrangements are nearly identical to their 1970s demos, Roth has completely re-written not just the lyrics, but the vocal arrangements -- in other words, the singing melody has been altered.  IMO this shows Roth's unwillingness to sing the kind of lyrics he thought were appropriate when he was 20 years old -- and that's a GOOD THING.  Kudos to Roth.<br /><br />DLR knows his audience and respects who they are -- you can see it any lyrics addressing women on this CD. Referring to the target of his affections as \\"soccer mom\\" and (my favorite) the line in \\"Tattoo\\" which goes, \\"Mousewife to Momshell in the time it took to get that new tattoo.\\"  Roth knows he SHOULD be cajoling women in their 40s or 50s (not 16-year-olds any more), and his lyrics reflect this.<br /><br />I think that's very very cool.  Check out the lyrics to \\"Outta Space\\" if you never thought you'd hear Roth singing about population problems and environmental disaster.  How did he manage thatwithout blowing the laws of Rock n Roll Cool?  But he carries it off.<br /><br />The special edition (from Asia) has a short DVD of the gang performing unplugged versions of a few songs.  Roth's sheepdog wanders in and out of the proceedings.  Not a \\"must have\\" extra but good fun.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|And after my iPad disaster (my autistic son dropped it on the corner and cracked it), I recognize the value of corner protection.  I thought I wouldn't like the fact there is only one setting for tilting the kindle, but I don't.

0307594165|5.0|Toni Morrison is a literary genius.<br /><br />\\"I can be miserable if I want to. You don't need to try and make it go away. It shouldn't go away. It's just as sad as it ought to be and I'm not going to hide from what's true just because it hurts.\\" (from page 131)<br /><br />Why is it so hard to write about books that are so amazing? I always seem to have this issue with my favorite books. This is definitely the case with Toni Morrison's Home. Even though the novel is shy of 200 pages, the story inside it is so artfully crafted and brilliantly executed. The varying points of view and switch between first person and third person gives the reader different versions of the 'truth'.<br /><br />I've learned about eugenics in my women's studies classes. It's a horrible dark secret in American society that often gets overlooked or ignored. In a way, I am glad that Morrison decided to talk about this piece of history in her latest novel. I am disgusted that it happened, don't get me wrong, but I strongly believe in learning about any sort of discrimination. That's another reason why I admire Morrison so much. She links together all of the oppressions and shows how racism exists right along with sexism and classism. The voices of minorities have always been silenced, and there is great power in learning from the past. The other choice is to ignore it, but what does that do to a person?<br /><br />Frank is a perfect example of this. He may not be a perfect person, a perfect brother or boyfriend, but he is still human. He tries to ignore the past and it just haunts him and pulls him into a downward spiral. His post-traumatic stress is clear through his hallucinations and 'abnormal' reactions. When he finally says the truth, though, he is freed from that poisonous denial.<br /><br />I can't recommend this novel highly enough. If you love happy, care-free novels, then this isn't for you. You might say it's too depressing, too dark, too somber. But to her fans (like me) it is empowering and hopeful. The message here is really strong and inspiring. Nobody should make you feel like you're worth nothing. You might get discriminated against because of the color of your skin, or your gender, or the lack of money in your pockets, but those oppressors aren't better than you. No one is better than you. It takes a lot of courage to see that and accept it, but it's true.wering and hopeful. The message here is really strong and inspiring. Nobody should make you feel like you're worth nothing.

I recently got into the stock market about 4 months ago after taking over a portfolio that my grandparents had set up for me when I was born.

0385344228|5.0|...I'm serious...I could not put this down..Although other reviewers did not like the \\"long-winded\\" author's story-telling, I loved getting inside the head of a DA, husband, and parent who struggles with his own family secrets.  I also enjoyed the court narrative from a DA's perspective, learning about the drama, police and games played out during criminal trials. Although I predicted some aspects of the story, I was never 100% sure, and the ending caught me by total surprise. The only part of this narrative where I could not suspend disbelief was the unshakable father's blind faith in his son's innocence, despite much evidence to the contrary. The author could have put more conflict into this, to make it more believable. On the other hand, the author made the struggles of loving parents raising a damaged son very real to me.

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This is a very good hidden object game. There are several kinds of searches for variety and the story mode is very long. You do not have to log into Facebook to continue, but it does ask you to fairly often. Just close the login screen if you don't want to link to Facebook. Also, not every wrong touch will result in a time penalty, but several in a row will. The only thing that keeps me from giving this game five stars is that the mini games could be more challenging, but for pure hidden object fun, the game is excellent.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|So, when Vampire Diaries (the series) originally came out, my first reaction was, \\"Good God, this is Twilight all over again\\" (and in case you were wondering, I don't like Twilight). Now that it's been out for three seasons now, I decided to give it a chance and bought the first season on a whim. Although I still maintain that it's rather Twilight-y with its love triangle and its brooding and its near-perfect female lead with brunette hair... this is WAAAAAY better, on all accounts - including the books. I didn't care for the first couple of books... the show, in MY humble opinion, is superior. And perhaps it's because I'm female and I enjoy this show purely for the gorgeous men/boys... I like to think of it as \\"True Blood\\" if you took out all of the crazy sex and at least 3/4's of the blood - not necessarily for kids, but for those who don't have any desire to expose themselves to the unnecessarily graphic and gratuitously explicit sex and violence, which, at least in my mind, is a plus (and yes, I've watched True Blood... watched all the way up to season 4 and then stopped... and I've read all the books. I've done my homework, this is all opinion based).<br /><br />Long story, short, this series, at best, is a guilty pleasure for me. Does it have its flaws? Of course. But does that take away the sheer joy of watching and indulging? Of course not. :)
1451627289|1.0|I love Stephen King's stories but usually get bored with the in-depth details and repetition.  I was hoping it wouldn't be so with this novel.  I was looking forward to the story of JFK and time travel to save him.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  After making it 200 pages into the novel the man was still waiting to stop the janitor's dad from killing his family.  Now if they make this into a movie I will watch it like I have King's other books that have been turned into movies.  But really is there the need to have something happen and then the narrator say he did sneeze or something along those lines.  It happened many times during what part of the novel I read.  Anyways, I really wanted to like but just couldn't do it.  The story moved too slow for me to finish it.

B005LAIH5O|3.0|I was a little disappointed with Wrath of the Titans.  The first film was by no means perfect, but it was entertaining and you got a sense of Perseus as a real hero.  Even though the production values, special effects, amount of action scenes and creatures have all been ramped up significantly for the sequel (this film is GORGEOUS on Blu Ray by the way) the film just seemed sort of \\"empty\\" to me.  There's wasn't really much for Perseus to do here and I find that disappointing.  It should have been his movie and it wasn't.  Wrath of the Titans is still a marvel of a movie to look at and certainly has its moments, I just wish they would have kept the emphasis on Perseus and his heroism instead of taking that away from him in order to center the film around bickering and fickle gods who's affairs were much less interesting.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|Cheap chick flick full with clichês. I couldn't finish this book - stopped reading about 2/3 through it. Gave me an impression of something written for teenage girls turned on by \\"bad boys\\".
0345803485|3.0|People at work were talking a lot about this book, and so I bought it to take on vacation. Work has been insane, so I was happy to read something that was not going to make me think too much. Sometimes I enjoy a little crappy reality TV for the same reason. This book fit the bill.<br />I read it non-stop for a day, but once I got about halfway through I was wondering what was going to happen. I imagined all kinds of scenarios that could have played out, and to be honest, the only reason I finished the book was to find out what was going to happen, because SURELY, something has to happen, right? As I read on, I began to notice \\"his/her mouth pressed into a hard/grim line\\" used over and over. Then I began to count the use of the word \\"clamber\\"--which was not only overused, but also to describe part of a sexual act. He clambers on top of her? Really? Also, the use of \\"Argh\\" as something cried out during sex made me laugh. If I did that, my husband would think I was making a joke. As someone reviewed earlier, it reminds one of pirates.<br />I had the book on my kindle, and when I got to the end of a chapter and no more pages came up, I realized it was the end of the book. That was it? That's what everyone was talking about? I was pretty disappointed that nothing really happened. It was annoying to read the same sex scene over and over, the same words,  etc...and then have nothing really happen. It definitely entertained me for most of the book because I just wanted something to get my mind off of work...but I wish that I had read something else, in retrospect. Even I know that a good story has to have some sort of climax...and maybe the author got confused about what kind of climax makes a good story.

This memoir was informative, shedding light on the mentally and physically abusive coaching methods of Bela and Marta Karolyi, and sending a message that we need a change in the way gymnastics is run in this country. I found the story of Dominique reuniting with her then-unknown sister Jennifer both heartwarming and heartbreaking. This book is a must for fans of gymnastics, for those who love exposés, and for those who love a story of triumph over darkness.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I didn't read the book. But I love the reviews. REviews rarely make me laugh out loud, but these do. I will skip the book. It can't be anywhere near as good as the reviews.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought and read this book on Kindle because of the rave reviews.  Rarely does one find so many 5 star reviews for any book!  Now that I've read it, I can see why.  The book is very well written with great plots, unexpected twists and wonderful character development.  I had a hard time putting this book down until it was finished. Now I can't wait to read more of his work.  I was planning to review each of the 5 books in this volume, but they flow so well together that it seemed more like long chapters in one incredibly good book.  Sci-fi at its best. Buy and read this book, you won't regret it!!!!

0345803485|5.0|This book was great! I loved it! Alot of people are saying that it is not well written but you cant hardly notice, except for a few words that are repeated a few more times than really necessary. Otherwise it's great, especially if you love the type of romance novels that are rough through out and end with a happy ending. Great! Wouldn't regret reading this and the other two at all!!
B00004WPAE|5.0|If you're a die hard fan, it is a must have analog LP. My advice, however, is to find a good quality used LP without any digital manipulation. The new Beatles' LP's are digitally remastered. A vinyl Beatle album produced in the 60's through the 1990's is as close to a 1:1 representation to what happened in the studio as you can get. And if you buy good LP's and take care of them, snaps, crackles, and pops will be very low or non existent except between songs. Compare to digital (CD's, DVD's, SACD's, DVD Audio). The difference in sound is incredible. You can still find good Beatles LP's out there for $15 if you take time to look. Analog LP's are so much warmer and the sound is fantastic compared to digital. My next quest is to hear LP's through tube amplifiers. Supposed to be great sounding.
0553386794|5.0|One of the most enthralling books I have ever read. I can't recommend it enough, and can't WAIT to read the second book!
B003Y5H5BA|3.0|For the most part, I found it to be a bad, somewhat boring and predictable, film which somehow manages to entertain by forcing you to wonder what mishaps Hill and Channing will get themselves into next. Despite the fact that they are seperated for a good part of the film there is no question that Channing and hill have on-screen chemistry that manages to keep the film together. Unfortunately, the script was rather weak. Many jokes will fall flat, but if u can manage to get by it than you'll see a Johnny Depp cameo which was pretty cool.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Fast read just like the 1st book.  Daughter 10 loves this series & is reading it for the second time.  What a great buy!  Don't have to force her to do her summer reading :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved reading 50 Shades of Grey , I was suprised I get bored easly; However I was hooked with Ana and Christine , the storyline had me thirsty for more, I dont see how the book got so many bad reviews, Its a book get over it , I hope she writes more Book
B005USZYDU|5.0|easy reading, entertaining, good character development, plot and mystery.  Probably aimed at audiences 40 to 50 years my junior, but a refreshing break from the more complicated and even risque' novels for adults.  I would think this series of Theo Boone pieces could be positive influences on early teens and even young adults.  Hope Grishem continues with a few more.
0143119680|2.0|I haven't been able to get past page 179.  It's one thing to write beautiful descriptive prose, such as James Lee Burke does when describing the area around New Iberia, Louisiana, but Harkness goes on and on and on about food and smells and wine.  I usually have a fairly good idea about a story about 50 pages in, and so far I can tell the relationship between most vampires, witches, humans, and daemons is not harmonious, and there's something about a book.  I had really high hopes for this book, and I think if I could get past all the adjectives about food, and the descriptions about how it was prepared, I would probably enjoy it.  I'm ready to get to the meat of the story (no pun intended).
141690977X|1.0|If this book were written as is but identified as a broad satiric \\"fictional\\" comedy, then I think it would be more accurate. However, it's presented as a sincere \\"self-improvement\\" book that is being gobbled up as gospel by both men and women which is both sad and dangerous. The publishers missed a great chance at creating a comic gem that is a reflection of our times. Apparently, the makers of the film that was inspired by this book, blew that chance as well.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ernest Cline is a genius!  I loved every page of 80 nostalgia and video game humor along with the virtual world he created.  The writing is entertaining and witty as well as being great for a laugh while the story is always moving forward.  You can't help but root for Wade, Ache, Art3mis and all the rest!  Plus I now wish I could live and play in the OASIS.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|simply awesome. we love this game. Easy enough for children, but still fun for adults. Love that you don't absolutely have to buy extras. It may take longer but you can do it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I decided to read, or should I say try to read, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" on vacation recently figuring it would be an easy quick read.  However, I guess I could say it was too easy.  The plot had very little depth to it, it was just about Ana and what's going on in her mind. Additionally, the writing style was very poor in my opinion.  For example, the author, who is British, tried to write an American novel and failed... Clothing styles were refered to \\"smart\\" which hasn't been used since my parents were teenagers to describe an outfit or look.  Also, characters were too \\"dreamy\\" and impossible to believe.<br />Maybe I didn't enjoy the book because I'm use to reading authors who write fast-pased books such as John Grisham or John Lescroart who have numerous plot lines in them so this was a major change for me.  Maybe if you typically enjoy romance novels, you might enjoy the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trillogy, but I believe even those who traditally read them will find these books very flat and unbelievable.<br />Another reason why I was disappointed was that I do enjoy erotica and it did not live up to my expectations. When you write erotica female body parts should not be referred to as \\"down there\\" and orgasims do not come that easy for women.  If you are use to reading erotica, don't hope this book will satify your desires, it's more of a romantic novel than anything else.<br />It was so bad I could not finish the first book... that is very unusual for me!

B000OONQ9O|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend as one of his Christmas gifts. He watched this movie when he was little and was very surprised I found it. This movie is quite something. I was skeptical at first, because I didn't see the appeal. However, this movie is quite good! It's about a gangs struggle to clear their name. Based in Coney Island. Very happy that I found a piece of my boyfriend's childhood to give him now that he's older.
1469984202|5.0|I was so impressed with this book!  Mr. Howey has crafted a well-thought out, well developed, gripping read.  The characters have great depth -- even the villains are multi-dimensional.  So often I read a book, especially in the science-fiction genre, and find one sticking point where I think, \\"but why didn't they ever figure out...\\" or some plot point that never quite fits or makes sense.  I never ran across that with this book.  Howey is the best writer I've run across in a long time and I can't wait to read more.
B001HN6918|4.0|I really liked the original `Kung Fu Panda'.  It was cute and the animation was really top notch.  Now that my daughter is older and has become obsessed with the television show (yes, obsessed is HER word for the matter) I've come to have a shaky feeling about the idea of having her watch a cartoon whose sole purpose is to depict martial arts being used on everyone.  Sure, it's the age old `good versus evil' which is kind of used in every cartoon, regardless of tone, but there is something about the excitement of watching someone get beat up that should be reserved for teenage boys, right?  I don't know, I mean, the film is cute and has charm and it is funny in many parts, but the overall feel I get is one of discomfort as the character's punch and kick and fight to the death on numerous occasions.<br /><br />Call me a prude or call me a parent, but at times I feel they should go hand in hand.<br /><br />But, as a film I kind of liked this.  It was just as good as the original, which is a tough hurdle to cross for almost every sequel.  The animation is stellar and the character development is just as tightly etched here as it was in the original, which is a nice bonus.  The storyline has similarities to the original (really, it is a formula that is regurgitated countless times and yet it feels freshly done here, which is nice) and I was pleased to see that the original cast returned.  I just hate it when they cast new actors to play previous characters.  In the end, I am iffy on recommending this because of the violence level, but each parent knows their child and so they can make that decision for themselves.  As a film itself, this is a good one.  It has its own identity and personality, and that is a rarity these days.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY love this album ! It is so amazing to see how much of a grown man Chris Brown has become. His music gets better and better each album!
B003H9M1QM|5.0|A Disney classic! I love Dumbo and in this Blu-Ray disc version it really does look remastered! The cardboard case around the plastic case came undone, however I fixed it by gluing it back. This movie is one of my favorites! It also teaches someone not to be ashamed of a body part that they might be insecure about! Love this movie and always will!
B0051OJG4Q|2.0|I have compared this 8 Albums version with the EMI Capitol version, the sound is immaculate on the latter. The Capitol is tuue stereo HI Fi with a lot of effort put into the reissue. The 8 classic album issue is a straight copy of vinal in mono. Thankyou to the record store that gave me the opportunity to listen and compare before I purchased. Maynard Ferguson is on trumpet on the About the Blues album for the die hard Maynard Ferguson Fans out there. Grab the Capitol version before it goes out of print.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|Like with most films in this genre, `Wanted' comes with a steady list of pros and cons.  As an exciting piece of filmmaking, `Wanted' raises a certain bar.  It relishes in its abundance of bloody violence, using CGI embellishments and sharply executed editing to keep the audience drawn in from frame to frame.  Story-wise, the film is a tad underwhelmed considering that its own plot holes derail some of the satisfaction one could have here.  The acting is actually very well across the board.  James McAvoy dons a perfect American accent and Angelina is well within her element as a serious `bad girl'.  She knocks another action persona out of the park with effortless sensuality and devilish aggression.<br /><br />Sadly, the film is snagged by horribly used narration (it just isn't handled well here at all) and the plot developments are weighed down by some regurgitated sequences.  Still, the action is top notch and exhilarating and the special effects are mind blowing in parts (that train sequence in particular is stellar).  McAvoy's office `switch' is the best scene in the film (I totally want to hit someone in the face with my keyboard) and the car chase in the red corvette really sets a bar VERY high for film's to follow.<br /><br />If you want a mindless action flick that will keep you tuned in, this is for you.  I was hoping for something a tad smarter (even Jolie's `Salt' has more common sense at use here) but then again, when you have a film circling the actions of a thousand year old cult of assassins who get their targets names from the looms in a textile mill, well...I guess you can't expect a really `smart' film.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I found this book very helpful, clearly written, and informative. It's an active example of what to do and how to do it well.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|My wife and I don't watch too much tv. Our bar is pretty high for what we want to see on tv. We both LOVED the LOST show and when we saw that some of the creative minds behind that show were a part of this new show we had to check it out. After the 1st episode we were hooked. We really enjoyed the new way in which these fables were being told and intertwined with one another. The quality of the production, writing and acting are of total quality. Looking forward to the 2nd season with great anticipation. Though I must admit, I probably won't buy the blu-rays until the series ends and there is a box set, just my preference.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|What a great addition to my film library. Exceptional script & excellent acting. Might be the best black comedy ever. With classic lines like \\"no fighting in the war room\\" & \\"you'll have to answer to the Coca Cola Company\\" and many others, this film is memorable & it's held up through the years. It's always fun showing this to the younger folks who have never seen it. This anniversary edition includes some cool extras: interviews with reporter Bob Woodward (Watergate) & director Spike Lee offers unique perspectives & insights into this phenomenal piece of work. Also, never seen before footage of the late great Peter Sellers & a cool little booklet containing even more inside info.<br />Thank you Amazon!!!! Very cool.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|The idea of a film portrayal of Margaret Thatcher is an interesting one.  I just really wish that this film were more interesting.  Instead of giving us anything of substantial depth, director Phyllida Lloyd serves up a series of scenes that serve no purpose other than to prove that Meryl Streep can do anything.  Sadly, her performance is hindered so drastically by the horrific pacing and emotional emptiness that I feel her Oscar win will be largely considered one of the most undeserved in recent years.<br /><br />I'm not going to sit here and bash the film.  It isn't...terrible.  Some critics were relentless and some of my friends said it was the worst film of 2011.  It wasn't.  At least this film isn't insulting.  I would watch this again before watching something like `The Descendants'.  That being said, this film is far from good.  It is actually pretty bad, especially for what it attempts to do.  Lloyd is a very inept director (as was proven by her botched job with `Mamma Mia') and trying to tackle something of considerable depth left her coming up VERY short.  She manages to take a woman who had so many stories to tell and reducing her to a montage a scenes with zero complexity.  The shoddy editing takes us in and out of Thatcher's life, at times in nonsensical order, as a way of weaving her past into her present, but this only serves as a way to take us out of the story and place us elsewhere.  If it weren't for Streep's obvious handle of the material I would have turned the film off a quarter of the way through.  It lags too often, and the unintentional camp that comes in with the constant regurgitation of events (the handling of Thatcher's hallucinations is clich&eacute;d and overused) made my eyes hurt from all the rolling they were doing.<br /><br />It feels weird to say that Lloyd should have called up Ron Howard for tips on how to build a coherent and engaging portrayal of mental illness, but she should have.<br /><br />The lack of emotional connect makes this a really shallow portrait of an important woman.  By film's end, we really don't learn anything about her.  Lloyd is so bent on portraying Thatcher's inability to let go of her late husband that she fails to build anything else, and she forgets to really color in WHY Thatcher can't let go.  The scenes with Streep and Broadbent don't paint Denis Thatcher as anything special or really allow them to build a relationship.  In fact, Thatcher is basically painted as a solitary entity the entire length of the film with no real emotional ties to anyone.  Her ambition drives her, but that is never truly explored, and I wouldn't have even took to that concept had Broadbent not shouted it at the camera in one particular scene.  Lloyd doesn't layer anything here.  She tries to pass off segues as complete thoughts (let's zoom in on a photograph and then show scene that has no tie to the last and then zoom out at an old woman staring blankly at a wall and call that depth) and it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Streep is a wonderful actress.  She can really do no wrong.  Her talent is non-negotiable and yet even she falls victim to Lloyd's horrendous grasp of the material.  By splicing the film in such a nonsensical manner, Lloyd has stripped Streep's performance of depth and meaning and merely presented us with a really good mimicry act, but nothing more.  Streep embodies Thatcher, but she doesn't tell us anything about her.<br /><br />Poor Viola Davis.s a really shallow portrait of an important woman.

Yes, you do see all the gory bits from the episodes (like in \\"Guts\\" where they chop up, dismember and bathe in the zombie guts).  There's some great bonus features in this set from interviews to how they do the scenes and even \\"Zombie School\\".

He may be a little controlling like Edward but it does make him sexy.<br /><br />I actually liked this book better than Twilight probably because I got really tired of the whole we can have sex till were married thing in Twilight. This book is more realistic. I read this one on iBooks because I was afraid of the bad reviews and my sister had it on her iPad but I'm going to get the Kindle version of the second book because I liked it so much.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Like many others here, I felt this book started extremely well and rather enjoyed meeting Will Robey, a killer for the government, and a little girl named Julie who has endured significant  tragedy.  I even got through the middle of the book without losing interest, but I found it wandering, and about 3/4th of the way, Baldacci seems to have lost his focus, giving us some pretty unbelievable things to consider, and then culminating with a very mediocre ending.<br />I agree that Julie, the 14 year old is a great character but felt her 'age' was a reach for anyone who knows 14 year old kids.<br />And........ then there is my reference to Jack Reacher.  If you read Lee Child books, you will know what I am saying, and if not, you should read his books.  Will Robey proves that flattery is the most sincere form of flattery.<br />I am confident that we will see another book about Will Robey and Julie and I might well read it, but I do hope Baldacci takes us all the way to the end next time.<br />In closing, Baldacci's \\"Camel Club\\" series was his best by far for me, and I would like to see him do another of that series but am guessing he thinks Robey is his new character of the future.

B003K16P3M|4.0|Imagine a world where certain people are 'graced' with special talents such as the ability to read minds, or superhuman survival skills, or just the ability to swim better than anyone else.  And then, what imagine if you could influence other people with your words, to the point of even having your words come out of someone else with the influencing ability undiminished.<br /><br />Would you be accepted for your skills, looked down on, admired, or even feared for those skills?  Kristin Cashore explores all of these issues in her book Graceling, the first of a trilogy, with a heroine for our modern age.  Katsa realizes her ability to kill when she's touched in an inappropriate way by an uncle.  Katsa kills him with one blow, and without a single thought.  She horrified at her newly discovered ability which her uncle, the king uses to dispatch his many enemies.<br /><br />While this isn't a perfect book, it is exciting and new, a combination of Lord of the Rings, with its own magical world, Twilight with its supernatural romance, and the Hunger Games with a heroine that can really take care of herself.  Katsa belongs on the big screen with her warrior skills, and her painful self doubt.  She's a perfect wounded soul who does her best to make the world as right as she can with the secret council she heads with her friends. Hoping to right some of the wrongs she's forced to commit by her corrupt uncle the king of Middlun, Katsa bands together with her friends to help out anyone who's been abused by one of the corrupt rulers of the 7 kingdoms.<br /><br />The sudden climax of the story took me by surprise, but not in a satisfying way.  The crime of Leck was so large, and he was such a worthy opponent that I wanted him around for forever.  The kind of antagonist who forces the hero to dig deep to defeat him, which is what makes for an exciting story.<br /><br />The love story is specific about what happens to the main characters, though it's not graphic, which makes Graceling not for the very young reader.<br /><br />The story continues with the young queen Bitterblue who Katsa rescues in the first book.  I haven't read it yet, but I plan to.  I really enjoyed Graceling.  The characters were well-rounded and realistic and grew as the story progressed.  The world Cashore created is intriguing and exciting to delve into.  All around great writing.

The first is for everyone who HAS NOT SEEN IT: THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!<br />It is very fun to watch, and if you know any of the songs, don't be afraid to sing them aloud in the theater. Chances are someone else will join you/has already started. Its quite fun. The actors do a great job of singing, and I actually like some of the tracks done here more than the originals. I took my father to this, a teen-20s in the 80s, and he was SOOOO excited to go, and we've seen it twice, want to GO AGIAN, and we BOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK AS SOON AS WE LEFT the theater the first night.<br />I'm going to get this on blu-ray the day it comes out.<br />Just to warn some of you, IF YOU ARE CONSERVATIVE, be careful when you watch this movie. I personally thought the \\"risque/racy\\" scenes were hilarious, and I enjoyed them, however I know some people would think them innapropriate.<br /><br />FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WRITE REVIEWS:<br />Seriously? Do you really have nothing better to do than point out what you think are \\"flaws\\" in this movie? So what if its an \\"adaptation?\\" DO YOU KNOW WHAT ADAPTATION MEANS? It means its NOT THE SAME.<br />I went to ERAGON the night of its premier. I had waited 2 YEARS to see it. I took a survey that night, and being a fan of the books, I wrote how excited I was, that the author was a genius, how I had waited two years, all my expectations...<br />Then I watched it.<br />And I was ROYALLY PISSED.<br />I could not believe how much they ruined it.<br />And I told them so. But later I realized that I should have watched it like it wasn't related. Because its an \\"ADAPTATION.\\"<br /><br />You should know before you go in that its 80s music. If you don't like the movie AS ITS OWN PRODUCTION, then you can say so. But separate the two.<br />The Sound of Music is remembered for Julie Andrews Edwards, not for it being a musical and a movie.<br />They are separate entities.<br /><br />On a final note, I personally was not a fan of the female lead either, however, that's who they chose, they stuck with it, and it still turned out to be a FABULOUS movie.<br /><br />********EDIT********<br />THIS IS FOR THE EXTENDED EDITION<br />For those of you who MUST HAVE everything \\"EXTENDED EDITION\\" then go ahead. There are some great extra scenes that would have been cool in the original cut. HOWEVER: this is not true of the entirety of the extended edition, in which you must watch THE ENTIRE COLLECTION of the extra scenes. MOST OF WHICH actually TAKE AWAY from the magic of the movie, and almost ruin it.<br />So be warned, watch the theatrical version first, and make sure it is the one you share with your friends.<br />The extended version is IMHO not worth the time, and brings less enjoyment than the theatrical version.he female lead either, however, that's who they chose, they stuck with it, and it still turned out to be a FABULOUS movie.<br /><br />********EDIT********<br />THIS IS FOR THE EXTENDED EDITION<br />For those of you who MUST HAVE everything \\"EXTENDED EDITION\\" then go ahead.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I want to review each novel on its on accord.  I have read a few of the reviews and as someone said you either love it or hate it.  For what it's worth I think it's a good novel.  I am going to have read the Twilight series in order to understand the comparison between the two novels/series.  But in any event, if you are looking for an erotic novel that will have you panting and sweating - this is not it, it's a romance novel, with this S&M aspect to demonstrate the depth of Christian's control.  The sex is neapolitan -- there's variety but nothing that is overwhelmingly exciting.  I agree with others the descriptions are repetitive and gets boring after awhile.  But as for the novel itself, I like the premise.  I liked that Ana is able to bring something out of Christian that he never wanted unleashed.  I like the email interchange between them.  Although, I can't help but ask why would an intelligent, outspoken, young woman who never been in a relationship before, never had any sexual experience, go for a man like Christian?  Ana is a romantic, or has desire for romance so why would she fall for a man that is controlling, guarded but most of all emotionally unavailable.  Then I started analyzing the characters.  Ana is self-conscience with a low self-esteem but she is a care taker by nature.  Christian thought he could easily dominate her both sexually and mentally but Ana proved to be more outspoken than he bargained for and presents a challenge that is both welcomed and unwelcomed.  For Ana the \\"beautiful\\" Christian is someone Ana wants to care for; nurse his mental and physical hurts and understand why he is the way he is.  She believes with her love she could \\"bring him to the light\\".  I read a review from a magazine that said this novel is was about submission but for me it's about limits - how far would a person go for love?  How much would a person give or not give for love?  What is a person's absolute limit?  What is keeping me reading is hoping that I find the answers to my questions.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this game a lot. This game is a hard fast game that has danger at very twist and turn. I know it might hang up sometimes but tell me one game that dose not hang up at one time or another. I would just give it a try if you do not like uninstall it.

B000FBFN1U|2.0|1. The book is extremely well-written, and I have become a fan of the series. This being my third book has given me an insight on the direction which the author has taken the series.<br /><br />2. There is no moral backbone to this story. The author has not explained why anybody does anything besides primitive needs for sex and revenge. It is in reality a meaningless story, even if you look at it through agnostic lenses. When the author stabs at the heart of anything noble as being of value, you get a very meaningless story. Existential angst?<br /><br />3. Characters are inconsistent at times. Littlefinger, Tyrion, and Varys have confusing identities, and not because they are complex, but because from chapter to chapter they don't behave like themselves. This is not because they are developing into a more mature and complex character, but because the author is bent on making bad people win regardless of the logical flow of the story.<br /><br />4. Is there really a need to use language akin to erotic stories? I don't get the over the top sexuality. The sex adds nothing to the plot. Porn for porn's sake is useless. What does it add to the story when the author describes in graphic language the noise Tyrion's penis made when it came out of Shae, when they had sex in Varys' room?<br /><br />5. It makes no sense that a house which has stood for 5 thousands years to come to an abrupt, and uninspiring end. You don't keep a house for 5 thousand years, and get ousted like the direwolf house did (trying not to give spoilers). It makes no sense that people like Ned Stark to be outwitted and outplayed in such a childish manner. Ned Stark knew he could not trust anyone, yet he trusted everybody in the manner of succession. It makes no sense.<br /><br />6. People of Westeros have no problem believing in gods, spells, curses and so on, but when intelligence comes that the Others have risen in the North, and that there are dragons in Qarth, they dismiss it with mockery. It makes no sense in the context of the story. You either are a skeptic or you are not.<br /><br />I thought this series might give Lord of the Rings a run for its money, but it fails miserably at doing that. This book is a lesser house under the shadow of Casterly Rock while Lord of the Rings is Aegon Targaryen the first of his name, riding a dragon and breathing fantasy fire on this lesser work, of a lesser author, read by lesser minds.u either are a skeptic or you are not.

B007TG34QU|4.0|I have to admit to being biased towards the performer. Any baroque release by Rachel Podger is to be eagerly anticipated. She continues to be at the top of her game in terms of stylish performance, musicianship, energy and elan. The musicians she chooses to record with --whether its her own Brecon group, the Arte dei Suonatori, or the Holland Baroque Society used here--all are first rate. Their enthusiasm imbues these performances. And we really did need a refreshed interpretation of Op. 9 (\\"La Cetra\\").<br /><br />That being said, there is a limit to how much the skill and enthusiasm of performers can overcome the source material. This is another personal bias--and I won't claim otherwise--but there are more interesting and inspiring Vivaldi opuses than Op. 9, and which would better reward a new approach.<br /><br />So I'd say this:<br /><br />1.) For those of you who are collecting as \\"Vivaldi completists\\", this new set is undoubtedly worthwhile; and I echo the views of other reviewers that it's likely a \\"buy it now\\" decision.<br /><br />2.) For those who are somewhat newer to Vivaldi's complete oeuvre, and are trying to avoid \\"death by 4 seasons\\" by hearing something different, I'd start elsewhere.<br /><br />Start, instead, by purchasing the Op 4 (\\"Stravaganza\\") done in 2003 by Rachel Podger and Arte dei Suonatori. This too, was in need of \\"dusting off;\\" a decade ago Podger's performances lifted the music to a new height and demonstrated how much more there was to the underlying material than many had realized.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00008IUW2 Vivaldi: La Stravaganza]]<br /><br />So, my two personal biases get me to an average score of 4 stars: 5 stars for the performances, which are everything I've come to expect from Podger; 3 stars for the \\"Red Priest's\\" Op 9. I just don't think opus 9 has enough going for it, even with Podger et al's valiant attempts to reinvigorate it. (can they please invigorate op. 7, 11 or 12?)<br /><br />But, also a strong encouragement to Vivaldi newcomers to boldly seek out other parts of his recorded edition, because Podger, Fabio Biondi, Giulio Carmignola (and others) have done so much to elevate our understanding over the past decade.<br /><br />See also these:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000007TKK Vivaldi: L'Estro Armonico - 12 Concertos]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005IA1S Vivaldi - Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione / Europa Galante, Biondi]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005UV9F Vivaldi: Concerti per mandolini]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005NF01 Antonio Vivaldi: Late Violin Concertos (RV177 / RV222 / RV273 / RV295 / RV375 / RV191) - Giuliano Carmignola / Venice Baroque Orchestra / Andrea Marcon]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00006L3PG Late Vivaldi Concertos: RV386 / RV235 / RV296 / RV258 / RV389 / RV251 - Giuliano Carmignola / Venice Baroque Orchestra / Andrea Marcon]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0019RQTUS Vivaldi: Concertos for Two Violins]]<br /><br />And for Podger doing Bach:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003X06BFW Bach: Violin Concertos]]ivaldi newcomers to boldly seek out other parts of his recorded edition, because Podger, Fabio Biondi, Giulio Carmignola (and others) have done so much to elevate our understanding over the past decade.<br /><br />See also these:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000007TKK Vivaldi: L'Estro Armonico - 12 Concertos]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005IA1S Vivaldi - Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione / Europa Galante, Biondi]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005UV9F Vivaldi: Concerti per mandolini]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005NF01 Antonio Vivaldi: Late Violin Concertos (RV177 / RV222 / RV273 / RV295 / RV375 / RV191) - Giuliano Carmignola / Venice Baroque Orchestra / Andrea Marcon]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00006L3PG Late Vivaldi Concertos: RV386 / RV235 / RV296 / RV258 / RV389 / RV251 - Giuliano Carmignola / Venice Baroque Orchestra / Andrea Marcon]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0019RQTUS Vivaldi: Concertos for Two Violins]]<br /><br />And for Podger doing Bach:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003X06BFW Bach: Violin Concertos]]
6304884419|5.0|A Bronx Tale is a movie everyone who likes gangster movies needs to have in their collection..The movie is shown on TV, however all the swear words and bleeped.  The movie loses some of its impact when this happens.  Anyone who lists The Godfather series as their favorites will love this movie.  And, as a bonus, the music background is first rate. The bar scene is everyones favorite.  The actor who plays Sonny, wrote the movie based on his real childhood experiences. A great find.
0920668372|4.0|I remember being very young, sitting in my mother's lap as we rocked back and forth in the rocking chair, and listening to her fight tears as she read this story to me. As a child I was so puzzled as to why this book would make her eyes well-up and her voice crack, but now that I'm a parent myself I completely understand. I love this book for a lot of good reasons - the bond between mother and child, how clearly I can hear my mother's voice when I read the familiar words, and how the illustrations take me right back to being a small child with my face pressed against my mother's blue bathrobe.<br /><br />Because my love of this book is so tied to memory, it's easy to ignore the creepiness that sneaks in towards the end of the story. However, I can commiserate with the previous reviews that found the mother's actions a bit absurd toward the end of the story. I admit that if I were to read this book fresh off the shelf with no attached memories, I'd be turned off by the fact that the mother is essentially breaking into her adult son's home so she can hold him in bed while he's sleeping. But if you ignore the dependency issues and focus on the broader elements of the story, it's still a good one.
0553801473|3.0|After reading the latest installment of Martin's series, I can't help but think the main theme is to avoid leadership at all costs.  This is a book about various characters who, upon rising to positions of leadership, struggle with the complexities and challenges inherent in leadership.  That's about it.  The characters struggle and we get to read all their thoughts and inner turmoil about every decision they make.  Every character who attempts to lead well with integrity and wisdom gets screwed in the end.  The moral of the story?  Leadership's a bitch.<br /><br />Honestly - it doesn't make for exciting reading.  Echoing many reviews, nothing happens here.  Did I really just read a whole chapter about Tyrion signing papers and scrounging through junk armor to find something to wear?<br /><br />If I understand the context correctly, George Martin wanted to skip ahead after A Storm of Swords and pick up the action again some years down the road.  Apparently there is more amazing story waiting for us about five years after the action of SOS.  The problem, if I heard right, was that there was just too much action...too much that happens to these characters in the interval period.  It just couldn't be summed up in a mere prologue.  It required another book...no - another book wasn't enough to cover the intermittent period between the main stories.  It required two books...big books...two volumes.  And each book could only deal with certain characters because there's just too darn much that has to be told...<br /><br />So here I am reading Dance with Dragons and I keep putting the book down after finishing a chapter and wondering, \\"is this the part that had to be told?  Was what I just read really indespensible?  We couldn't get onto the main storyline without knowing what Tyrion's thinking when signing papers?  Or without knowing what piece of armor he chooses from the scrapheap?  Don't get me wrong.  Both ADWD and AFFC have some major plot points that I'm sure actuallydo help move the plot along for the good stuff still to come.  But honestly - it all could easily have fit into one book...and maybe even one prologue.<br /><br />Unless, of course, we are actually concerned about the rigors of leadership and care to read about leader's thoughts...and thoughts...and thoughts...

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|SPOILERS !!!!!<br /><br />Omg seriously???? All the best people in here died! How awful...and she even ends it on a depressing note. Yes, they get together, have kids, blah blah...and then she is still sad and depressed at the end. WTF??? This entire series was SOOOOO good, and action packed, and the last 2 chapter had me throwing my Kindle across the room. So disappointed. I hope they change the ending a little bit for movie purposes. And how many times is Katniss gonna get knocked out and wake up in the freakin infirmary?! Jeez!

B007FZ7R7W|5.0|I prefer C Brown's slow stuff, so this album is fantastic, & he gives us the slow stuff, & the pop, fast, dance stuff.  I never thought of C Brown as being O G in any of his albums like someone else said, but love this one.<br /><br />I have always been a big fan of C Brown(the entertainer), not one to pass judgement on C Brown(the man), as no one is perfect & if Rihanna has forgiven him, then that's good enough for me. Any of us could have been in that situation.  There really is nothing for me to forgive him for as he did nothing to me to begin with, he won't be coming to my home for dinner, or is my friend, and & I don't put these guys on pedastals.  I separate the enterainer from the man.<br /><br />Back to the album, this album is the best album I have heard this year, & one of the best C Brown has made, I mean, like my titles states, I am breathless after listening to this album, & It has been on repeat since getting it. Favorites, are Don't Wake Me Up, basically track 7 to the finally. Say what you want about C Brown the man, C Brown the entertainer is amazing.  I love his album from start to finish, but track 8 9 10 12 13, are some of my favorites.  C Brown gives us a dynamic range in this album we have not seen in others, & really speaks to his talent.  What more needs to be said, I love this album, and any fan of his music or his style should get it.  End Of Discussion!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I made the mistake of buying all 3 books together. What a HUGE waste of money. This author needs an editor VERY badly. And anyone who has had a controlling, annoying boyfriend will hate this book. She can't go certain places, has to be home by a certain time, why no call or text? He acts like a dad, not a bf. I have a problem that I can't stop reading a book once I've started it, so I had to keep reading the first one. I ended up reading the other 2 just b/c I bought it, thinking it would get better. But no. It took me SOOOO long to finish b/c it was just so stupid. The only silver lining was the emails....those were funny.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Entertaining storyline, great graphics, a fun twist to an I spy game.  Easy to burn hours and battery life caught up in game play.
0553801473|1.0|Spoiler alert.<br />Pros:<br />Cersei's walk.  Stone people on river.  Warging in the beginning of the book with promise of Others.  Take down of some of the Freys.  Lord Manderly, now that's what I read these books, for.  What an interesting guy in such a horrible good way.<br />Cons:<br />No one gets anywhere, everybody is in mid journey to get somewhere. Not enough of the dragons, poor dragons.  Dany becomes wimpy, boring, and is in love with a boor.<br />Bran turns into a tree, but for what reason?  No Jaimie, or explanation of why Brienne shows up.Tyrion has a lot to do with traveling with another little person, but nothing comes of it.  Jon fights with everybody and does nothing but get stabbed in between organizing foodstuffs, and talking to lots of people.<br />And lots more.  Too many people get killed off, only to come back.  Arya continues to get used to killing people.  Same stuff.  Sansa and Littlefinger - not much happening, either.<br /><br />Seemed to be full of fillers of Dorne descriptions and the new Ageon.  Meerenese country and people so boring.  Lots of descriptions of food and traveling and eliminating wastes from the body. Some violent and disgusting sex, which seem like degrading s&m.  In great detail.  For no good reason to further the plot or show character development.<br />  Someone should edit this man. Dance and Feast could have been one short volume, and something might happen in Winds.  If it ever does get written.<br />  Don't buy this.  Just get it from the library and skim.
B006Z476J8|5.0|I wrote a short review of this classic album referencing the 2008 reissue with bonus tracks.  Mark Berry does an extensive review that I can only compliment on - it's spot on!  Again, as I mentioned in my other reviews of these remastered gems, the sound and quality of these discs is second to none.  I buy CD's mostly to listen to in the comfort of my car - listening at home can be fatiquing.  However, I'm having a gas listening to these gems at home - they actually rival the vinyl versions.  Material from the sixties and seventies is hard to translate digitally - a wonderful surprise, indeed!  Highly recommended!!!

B008FWHGYS|5.0|Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles (City of God, Blindness, The Constant Gardner, etc) once again demonstrates how far away from reality his films can take us, but at the same time how closely he can examine human foibles so that rather than being a spectator he involves the viewer into squirming through our own errors of assignations, past, present and future. The screenplay for this extended psychological thriller is by Peter Morgan (Longford, The Queen, Frost/Nixon. The Last King of Scotland, etc) and yet both men attribute the inspiration to Arthur Schnitzler's 1897 play La Ronde which scrutinizes the sexual morals and class ideology of its day through a series of encounters between pairs of characters (shown before or after a sexual encounter). By choosing characters across all levels of society, the play offers social commentary on how sexual contact transgresses boundaries of class. Meirelles and Morgan weave together the stories of an array of people from disparate social backgrounds through their intersecting relationships in locales such as Paris, London, Bratislava, Rio de Janeiro, Denver and Phoenix.<br /><br />The audience must pay full attention to the stories as they unwind as there is a huge cast of characters and most of them, even though briefly at times, are interconnected.  The film opens on Vienna where a photographer is taking stills of a Bratislava girl `Blanca' (Gabriela Marcinkova) who is being molded into a call girl while her hesitant sister observes.  We then see Blanca's first assignment, a British business man (Jude Law) who is thwarted in his pickup by a business rival (Moritz Bleibtreu): the business man is married to Rachel Weisz who in turn is in a torrid affair with a photographer (Juliano Cazarr&eacute;) who in turn is married to a girl in a red beret who works as a dental assistant for a dentist (Jamel Debbouze) who in turn stalks the dental assistant with guilty and unspoken passion. We also meet a young man Tyler (Ben Foster) as he is being released from prison as a sex addict and fears entering the world of women. In an airport in Colorado a gentleman (Anthony Hopkins) still searching for his missing daughter befriends Laura (Maria Flor) and while their flights are delayed Laura meets Tyler and decides to seduce him, but the terrified Tyler cannot navigate through his past guilt and fails to let Laura have her daring passionate way. The coincidences mount with many more substories than these and in the end much comes together back in Vienna when the now practiced call girl Blanca is involved in a one night stand with an exceptionally wealthy and ruthless Russian (Mark Ivanir) whose bodyguard meets Blanca's sister and the two share a friendship that has a surprise ending.<br /><br />This is only a smattering of the characters that populate this mesmerizing story, a story that is at times overwhelmingly confusing but when dissected slowly it produces a sense of awe in the viewer.  This is most assuredly a thinking person's film but one so exquisitely made that it deserves several viewings to grasp all the subtle nuances.  For those willing to commit, this is a brilliant film.

B005LAIGW8|5.0|What kept me from checking this out for a while was that it's from a couple of guys who did Crank. And that movie was overly done for anyone who was into meaningless movies with little story and a load of action, swearing, and sex. Luckily, the visual formula was perfect for this sequel to what I thought was an overly cheesy, hardly believable (at all) comic-based movie. I know that Ghost Rider, like any comic book by Marvel or DC, would likely have cheesy one-liners. Add to that super-cheesy CGI and a lackluster story along with predictable moments, and it's no wonder I couldn't completely enjoy it. In this case, most of the film is presented with a look that looked more realistic, grittier, and, all-in-all, much better. And when it's not presented in a more real-looking visual style, you can see the CRANK influence, and it was a definite trip. Post-emo artistic animation backstory sequences, a psychedlicesque bike ride that ended in a very comical style (I've heard of bad allergies, but that's completely different!), and even a couple random visual jokes that were pretty good, it was no wonder there moments I'd considered actually buying the film. Plus, unlike the Elementals in first film, the contract guy who gets turned into a man with the power to decay seemed a lot trippier (especially when he claims his victims). The story itself was rather funny, so I couldn't help but enjoy it throughout, so it helped enhance the comic-book action and humor.<br />And I've got to say, I don't miss Ghost's special soul attack from the first and am glad to see it replaced by the more subtle scare tactic he uses.
B000BZISTE|5.0|After all these years M*A*S*H is still worth watching.  A reminder of of any Mobil Army Surgical Hospital was then or could be now.  Funny and touching.
B004K4IZ54|2.0|Seller was excellent...received item on time and company great to work with with order from GreyWhale again in a heart beat.  I really like this movie but you can hardly tell any difference between the 2D and 3D version...which is DAD because this movie would have been great if filmed/shot in real 3D versus converted from 2D.  No depth to the 3D in this movie.  Don't waste your monie buy a used 2D DVD version for about $5 including shipping.
B005LAIH5O|5.0|Wrath of the Titans is a well done sequel to Clash of the Titans. The 3D experience makes it that much better. I highly recommend the 3D version.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I enjoy this game, though I don't like having to buy content to improve city stats. Other than that, it is fun and works well.

1843794411|5.0|This is my fourth audio book by Naxos Classic Fiction and am very pleased with the quality of the product.<br /><br />Richard Armitage always reads these books with such energy, enjoyment and his different character voices are entertaining.<br /><br />Usually with audio books being read by a man or woman, you don't always find the different characters as believeable.  Mr. Armitage<br /><br />makes them believeable and makes the entire story a real joy to hear. Please have Mr. Armitage read more of Ms. Heyer!!
1573228737|4.0|Another brilliant book by Sarah Waters. The creepiness \\"creeps\\" up on you in this one. A young woman becomes a \\"Ladies Visitor\\" at Millbank Prison. She encounters a woman known as a \\"Spiritualist\\", for whom strange things seem to appear and disappear, and for whom spirits do bidding. After falling in love with this woman, events race to an all too devastating conclusion.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm really glad I downloaded this game.  I like to play solitaire between books or when I'm bored or waiting on someone.  I recommend it.
B0086213XW|5.0|This movie made it hard for me to breathe.  I was just so poignant and heart-wrenching that I found myself holding my breath so I wouldn't spontaneously burst into sobs.  Then other parts were so adorable and cute and funny that you almost laugh but never quite come close because the sobs that didn't break out are still hovering in the background.  That sounds dramatic but in truth, I could so easily relate to what Margot had to go through and what she inevitably ended up with in return...It's hard to say too much without giving away any major plot points.  In any event, wonderful movie.  I though the part where Lou was rocketing through the 52 emotions at the table was the only major poor spot.  Way too forced and hardly believable at all.  You'll see what I mean.
B0056WODZ0|5.0|So glad i decided to download this book!Took a chance because i hadn't read anything from her before, but what a good decision:) U knw wen u'r hooked on a book wen u cnt put it down & read it in 1 sitting (thereby not being able to wake up for work the nxt morning,lol). Also luv wen an author has a wonderful sense of humour & it reflects in their books.Hav now read all the books in this series,& cnt wait for more.Def a good buy.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I started watching the series, Firefly on Netflex and got hooked on it at a friends house. I couldn't watch all the episodes, so I bought the whole intire series and I love it!!! The series was way beyone it's time and should not have ever left! Joss Whedon, has a great imagination. I am so sadden to have seen it come and go so quickly. This series should have stayed on for years to come. It was just getting started to where it needed to be and BOOM! Just like that it was gone!<br />I loved each of the characters played in this series. I did get to see Jewel Stait in The Stargate Atlantis Series as the new doctor. I watched that series from begining to the end. She is a great actress as all of them were. I'm sorry to have just caught this series way too late.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love Ice Age Village. I play it every day. I like to learn about different mammals. The game is fun and entertaining.

B005QPGHQU|5.0|I've had Evanescence's third album since it came out, and I have played it a lot since then.  I was quite pleased that this much more of a step forward than The Open Door.  After the first few listens I wasn't sure if I liked \\"What You Want\\", but it grew on me.  I listen to this album mostly while running, and I found that \\"End Of The Dream\\" is a great song for those tough stretches where you would really rather just stop.  The line \\"Follow your heart `til it bleeds/As we *run* toward the end of the dream\\" especially fitting.  I also really like \\"I'm not afraid/I push through the pain\\".  I know that I'm taking these out of context, but it's great motivation.<br /><br />I noticed some interesting use of Amy's piano playing on this album.  Whereas on Fallen she typically played to drive ballads like \\"My Immortal\\", it has more of an edge now.  This is especially true on \\"Erase This\\" and \\"Disappear\\" - the latter conjuring images of Michael Myers and Halloween.  Both of these songs are also just as heavy as other songs.  If you are hoping for something more earnest with piano, fear not.  You will find what you are looking for in \\"Lost In Paradise\\" and \\"Secret Door\\".<br /><br />Overall, Evanescence is a great, balanced album.  If you are wondering, the four additional tracks the Deluxe Edition are no mere throw-ins.  You will only be getting three quarters of the great material if you go for the normal edition.  This is the bounce back effort that Evanescence needed, and I highly recommend it to both new and old fans alike.<br /><br />Download this:  End Of The Dream
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|With the addition of the plug end with works wonderful for the Kindle Key Pad.  I love it.  It gives me an extra cord to put in the RV and not have to worry about forgeting it.
1250006341|5.0|This book is beautifully produced and very well written.  And it is succeeding in getting me through my enforced withdrawal from Downton Abbey.  I'm eagerly looking forward to its return in 2013, which happens to be much too long of a wait.  Still, the book is a comfort.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|What can I say, I am hooked on the Game of Thrones. Outstanding in Hi-Def. Watching the series made me buy all the books.
0812550706|5.0|There are quite a number of reviews that will tell you just how awesome this book is. Instead of going into a massive amount of detail, I am going to use popular cultural references to explain how great this book is.<br /><br />Ender's Game is like Harry Potter meets Sherlock Holmes in a sci fi setting. The main character, Ender, like Harry is destined to be the one to save the world and is chosen to go to a school very far away where he will fit in. Like Sherlock Holmes, Ender is super smart and meets every challenge that is thrown at him. Ender's Game is also like Harry and Holmes because the story is well developed and the plot twist are mind blowing. I bought the book yesterday and finished it today.<br /><br />The only downside is the writing style is not as good as say Asimov's stuff.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and was sad when I was finished reading it.  I tried to make it last as long as possible.  This story brought out a lot of emotions in me.  Surely, not a good time in our history.  I just loved the characters and found myself thinking of them all long after the book was over.  I wanted to the story to continue, and that is a mark of a good book to me.
0439023521|5.0|This book is very interesting! I couldnt put it down. It was so good! I love the action and I prefer to watch the movie AFTER the books!!!
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Drive is a beautifully filmed movie with many surprises. Not the usual 'car type' of film. The opening scene is fantastic! I love how the story unfolds and feels so natural and believable. The main characters slowly build their attachment to each other in the middle of a nasty element including bad deals and shady people. Good guys and bad guys are on the fence a lot of the time. Includes quiet glances, tough choices, warm smiles, rough characters, sharp blades and American cars. The scenery and soundtrack belong to this film. Mostly a harsh, concrete environment, but with a memorable scene that includes some happiness outside near the water and trees. A simmering story with some realistic views that give the viewer time to feel the mounting tension. Everything doesn't need to be spelled out and sometimes the eyes can say a lot. All the actors are very fitting & perform excellent in their roles. Revenge is sought out without enjoyment, but with an instinctive path.<br />The scorpion can't help but sting...Tick-Tock...
B005K17RU0|2.0|I loved this app until I really started paying attention to the temps it was reporting. Comparing it side by side with the weather channel app and Google weather, accuweather was often significantly different. The app has many great features that I will miss, but I am looking for a weather app that is a little more accurate than accuweather.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Love playing the game. Hate the commercials and ads but that is the world we live in. Took a couple of weeks to find the stats. Animation when you win is fun.
B000A6T1HC|5.0|Incredible range of feeling, voice, and emotion.  If you only need ONE baroque work, this would be it!  She captures the era's excitement, beauty and elegance and pays tribute to the great castrati.
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|This review is being written about 4 years after the film's initial release and very close to the lasted installment of Nolan's franchise. While a 1-star review is being harsh, it can be justified. I hadn't seen the film since the opening weekend 4 years ago and thought it was solid, so I decided to finally pop in the Blu-ray. I barely could finish the film this time. Like other reviewers, the Joker's \\"insanity\\" level was full throttle the whole time. While he did explain a brief story about the Joker's alcoholic father, the character was one-dimensional the whole time and had zero depth of motives beyond the \\"insanity\\". The Joker character also had gobs of different cronies at every turn: the opening robbery, the scene invading the dinner party, the scene capturing the black mob boss, etc, etc, etc. Every time these followers seemed willing to die for the Joker's cause, which was nothing. Were they paid? It just never made sense where these literally hundreds of bad guys came from. Even insane Arkham recruits would have been incompetent or killed the Joker themselves. Also, the Joker's elaborate plans of bombs, robberies, kidnappings, escapes, re-escapes, mind games, poisonings, and power plays would have been impossible to implement either by resources, time, or manpower. I know it's a comic book film and needs to be allowed some leeway, but it was so unbelievable. The film is titled the Dark Knight, but there was barely any Batman or Bruce Wayne involved, but in limited doses, most of which was punch throwing. I give an A+ for action and special effects, but there was no feeling behind what was happening. The run time was way too long and I feel the peak happened when the Joker was trying to Kill Dent in the Swat van. This was half-way through the film. I probably won't watch this film ever again, but it just drags to make me feel for any of the characters or story lines. While the film as a whole isn't terrible, as the title suggests this film is a product of being ridiculously over hyped and overrated to the point of madness, just like the Joker. Obviously this is my opinion, there are a 1000 5 star reviews, so I'm in the minority. Looking at the DK Rises previews, it looks like more of the same.
030758836X|3.0|To me, the beginning was so blah that more than once I thought to stop reading this book, but I continued on to find an intriguing plot, only to find an open ending, which I hate.  No closure, wouldn't recommend.
0345803485|4.0|Ok... So as I read this book I was thinking to myself \\"Is she forreal?\\" All the repetitive words, the crazy sex all the time got out of hand. I would not compare this to Pride and Prejudice or Jane Eyre but I think if you're looking to read something new, this is worth  your while. It definitely kept me entertained for a while.
B001DPC52C|5.0|This concert so out-did Nightwish's \\"End Of An Era\\" concert DVD and I'm a big Nightwish fan. I really didn't like how Nightwish used pre-recorded audio for the orchestral parts of the concert. It was like listening to the studio version while watching the concert. I'm not sure why Nightwish just couldn't have gotten an orchestra for that one night for the DVD. Within Temptation did it right for this DVD release. The live orchestra really brought out each song to life, I even enjoyed the songs that I was not into until I heard this. The band really meshed well with the orchestra, but my only gripe was that you couldn't hear the guitars when listening to the concert on DTS audio. On the DTS audio, the guitars are drowned out by the orchestra except when a solo was played, so I played it on 2.0 audio and the guitars are heard very well. Other than that, overall this DVD is excellent! Not only you get the excellent concert, but you also get behind the scenes and interviews of the band. Of course a live CD is also part of this package which is a plus. This is a must have as Sharon is so beautiful to stare at and the music is amazing!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|After attending the Beach Boys 50th year reunion concert (which was fantastic!) at the Hollywood Bowl, I had to order this album immediately.  First, the title song That's Why God Made the Radio knocked my socks off!  With its close-harmony vocals it will transport you right back to the Sixties.  Listen for the baritone sax in the chorus.  Gnarly!  The rest of the songs are also great and creative and really grow on you.  I've listened to the CD at least twenty times now and I'll listen to it again as I drive to UCLA this morning.  Each song contains interesting melodies, tight harmonies in the right spots, chord and key changes which will delight you, and occasional hints of hits of the past.  For example, you'll hear a few notes of Stairway to Heaven in the ethereal opening vocal, which I think is meant to be a tribute to Carl and Dennis.  Right after that haunting opener they rock you with That's Why God Made the Radio, and it varies from then on with differnt styles and moods.  The Beach Boys and their back-up vocalists and instrumentalists are superb and the mixing and recording are state-of-the-art (it was done in studio; I think even Brian would say it's perfect).  If you are a fan of the Beach Boys you will love this album!
B002RV01Q8|5.0|I've been a long time Enya fan now, and for so long I've waited for a DVD collection of Enya's videos. I've always had Enya's VHS \\"Moonshadows\\", but with only 5 videos it makes yiou want more. I was excited when I heard that Enya was coming out with a DVD of videos but unfortunatley it was not available for US market (PAL format only). So it took a 9 more years for us US fans to finally get Enya's videos, but it sure was worth the wait. This is a great package because not only you get the DVD portion of Enya's videos but also a CD of most of Enya's hits. Now, I purchased this mainly for the DVD portion since I have all of Enya's albums. I am very grateful for this DVD to finally have Enya's collection of vidoes, but I don't know why \\"Book Of Days\\" was left out when it was on \\"The Video Collection\\". I love this song and never have seen this video, I'm sure the video is mostly of clips of \\"Far And Away\\" but still would have been nice in this collection. Other than that, that was my only disappointment. The up-side to this, is you get the most recent videos \\"Amarantine\\", \\"It's In The Rain\\", and \\"Trains And Winter Rains\\" here. So overall this is a better DVD collection of Enya's videos, and like I mentioned earlier, you get a CD of Enya's collection of hits also.<br />\\"1987: Enya\\"<br />04.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was a slow start, unusual and brutal details of sex situations. If you are not used to these details, just get through the first 30 pages and it gets much better. Second half of the book was much better. I absolutely love book 2 and 3.
0345803485|1.0|Has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. So disappointed that so many of my friends live it. Like a teenage fantasy didn't even finish it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I came across Collins books on a library, and looked them on the Kindle library. Being a long time fan of science fiction I identified several subjects that have been used over and over, with different degrees of success; such as post-disaster worlds, gaps in technology and power, master and subservient races (all human here though), the decadence of those in power, the showcase of death and violence as a form of entretainment.<br /><br />However, the book was presented in such a way that it was difficult to put down. The narrative is clear and allows you to have a clear picture of what is happening in this world, the characters are not forcibly made to be likeable or to have heroe qualities about them; they are quite simply a couple of teens who had the ill luck to be thrown into this whole mess. That makes it all the more believable and opens the possibility to connect to the characters. The violence of the Hunger Games is not overused, and its focus on survival, and the relationships that are made within make it a hard book to put down.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|E. L. James' Fifty Shades series is a must read for anyone not afraid to read about the darker side of the bedroom.  When I purchased this book, I had no idea of what to expect since I had only heard that it was raunchy.  I was intrigued the moment the male character was introduced.  Let's just say I now understand why she chose the title.  I was totally wrapped up in fifty shades.  It was hot, steamy, and good to the last word.

B008B1W3V4|5.0|I love the band Maroon 5 since they came out in the early 2000's, they are very talented and unique, I even saw them once in concert in 2004 when they opened up for John Mayer near Chicago and I've been a fan ever since, they are awesome live to see in concert, every one of their cds are awesome and this one is great as well. I got the Clean version, because I don't like any bad language in the music that I listen to. Every song is awesome on here, I highly recommend this one to any music fan out there or any Maroon 5 fan as well, you won't be disappointed, what a great addition to my Maroon 5 collection. I wish the best of luck to Maroon 5 in the future to come, you guys rock, thank you for your talent that you have and keep up the great work. A++++ for this one. Its a winner!!!!!!!
B007I2BZIE|2.0|Everyone will have different views on the music.  Personally I think there is some excellent playing here.  It's a harder Rush than you might be use to.  A lot of similarities to Vapor Trails in some ways, but I like the guitar riffs here better.  Unfortunately the excellent music is wasted from the worst mastering I've ever heard.  There are no soft passages here as everything was compressed to a narrow volume range.  I have Revel Salon 2's, a Krell Evolution 403, and a Denon AVP-A1HDC1 preamp, so don't try to tell me I don't have a good system.  I purchased the 24 bit 96 kHz high res file and it has a bit less compression, but the sound is a joke compared to the old school Rush sound from Terry Brown.  I don't think the issue is the digital recording evolution.  I've heard a lot of fine digital recordings.  The issue is compression.  What I can't understand is how Rush allowed this to be released.  Perhaps they have no hearing left after years of loud music and can't tell the difference between good and bad sound anymore.  I'm looking forward to a new mix, but can't listen to this.  It gives me a headache.
B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|I will never ever listen to a new Linkin Park album.  There are just way to many good new bands to listen to waste my time listening to this junk.  This album is all techno from start to finish.  Do the fans a favor and break up ASAP.
0307716546|5.0|Not the book that I was expecting to read, but much better! A school is on fire and her daughter Jenny is inside so Grace goes in to save her. Then the unthinkable happens and she is trap in the rubble. From there, most of the book takes place at the hospital where Grace lays in a coma and is brain dead, and Jenny is burned and her body systems having trouble stabilizing. Their spirits meet each other as they try to figure out what happened and what caused this tragedy.<br /><br />This was a very good book. One that could be sappy and silly or overwhelmingly sad, but instead encourages the human spirit to do love with everything that is in you.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|Great songwriting and musical performance but the album as a whole is mixed and mastered too heavy on the low end and too loud throughout.  The album sounds muddy.  However the mastering of this album (done by Brian \\"Big Bass\\" Gardner) was supervised and approved by Rush.  Rush also hired Gardner to master their prior album S&A (and S&A does not sound muddy).  Audio-Times.com has a recent interview \\"Brian Gardner on mastering the new Rush Clockwork Angels album.\\"  Gardner confirms the participation of the band members in the mastering process.  For those of us fans that are disappointed with the mastering on this album we only have Rush to blame. This muddy sound, unfortunately, is the \\"atmospheric feel\\" that Rush desired in this particular album and was achieved by the mastering (and to an extent the mix) that they supervised and approved.  In fairness to Rush and Gardner the mastering on this album is not as bad as Vapor Trails (but it is still quite disappointing for such an otherwise impressive album).
B005HSL626|4.0|Love the game, can play it for hours,but soetimes it will stall, freeze, and quit unexpectedly. But only once in a while. Great for bored ppl!!
B007I2BZIE|3.0|Noisy, overly layered sound caused by TOO MUCH TWEAKING in the studio.  I thought they were trying to move away from this.  Whatever.  Imagine this material in the hands of Rupert Hine.  This is my way of saying I've been there since 1978 for this band, and accordingly, have cheerfully accepted all kinds of experimentation.  I am tired of vocals in search of a melody, and the production is HEAVY-HANDED.  I said it again.  I find myself not lasting through these eight-minute slug fests.  I've NEVER had that problem with a Rush creation before.  Mind you, and to remind you, I like to rock.  A lot.  I love these guys and always will.  I practically built their vacation homes with my purchases.  Almost every song that starts off with potential does not sustain the groove.  You cannot understand the lyrics as they are sung and overdubbed.  I give this three stars because they are Rush.  Maybe they should have released this album under an alias.  I'm totally conflicted with knowing this could be so much better. NOISY!!!!  When I played it loud in my car, I had to pull over because the out of control bass rumbling had me convinced I had engine trouble.
0345803485|1.0|Do the number of blushing words in the other reviews count as 20 words of the book?  I just saw the ad on TV to buy the book and read what \\"everyone is talking about\\".  That's always a killer for me, but here I am finding out what people are talking about.  I don't know about the book, but the reviews are hilarious and are probably infinitely more entertaining.  A lot of promising writers among them.

B006RUJST6|3.0|Good story, but left me a little unfulfilled.  I really liked both Lake and Will.  I loved that for the most part, Lake acted like a 18 yr old girl.  I appreciated that she behaved immaturely at times and tried to make Will jealous, or daydreamed about running him over, lol!  That is how most girls her age would react to the frustrating situation she was in.  Lake was spunky, strong, funny and I was rooting for her and Will.  I loved Will as well.  Especially when he got jealous and a little forceful...yum.  I will be very frank about why I'm rating this book 3 stars.  There is no sex.  I think they only kiss 2-3 times. She is 18, he is 21 and I get that b/c of the big \\"situation\\" it would be \\"wrong\\", but Will is like a saint or a monk or something.  I mean, she sleeps in his bed and he doesn't touch her!  I would have given this a much higher rating if they had given in to their feelings and desires.  When I read a romance, I want the couple to find eachother so irresistible that they won't let anything stand in their way.  I know this is a YA book and maybe that's why it's so clean, but Lake and Will seemed so fine with not having a physical relationship of any kind that it made me question their attraction a bit.  In a romance novel, I like both a emotional and physical attraction.  But that's just me! :)  I suppose when reading YA books, I should stick to \\"mature YA\\" like Thoughtless or Beautiful Disaster.  Anyway, just thought I'd post this review incase there's others out there like me who prefer a little action in their romances!

1410433765|2.0|The pure joy of being wrapped up in the kind of beautiful prose that makes a 600 page book worth the weight of carrying it around in my purse for two weeks never materialized. So I carried the book around for close to a month trying to push through the chapters that were full of summary rather than action. By the end of the book, I was just plain disappointed. The characters were flat, the dialogue rare and alternating between under and overwriting, and the moments that occured in the present were often of mediocre significance. Most actions occured offstage, in a poorly written 200 page pretend memoir. If I wanted to read a bunch of pages that summarized stories that had already occured,  I would spend my free time reading sparknotes. Overall, Franzen is too conscious of his sound and stifles the flow of a natural story.

1741794609|4.0|The Taj Mahal is beautiful because it incorporates sacred geometry[[ASIN:0195181433 Al-Kindi (Great Medieval Thinkers)]] of as I recall al-Kindi, and it is an embodiment of the day of judgment.  Any building with sacred geometry in it is beautiful, whether it is Angkor Wat [[ASIN:0824817206 Angkor Wat: Time, Space, and Kingship]], Stonehenge, [[ASIN:1426305990 If Stones Could Speak: Unlocking the Secrets of Stonehenge (Orbis Pictus Honor for Outstanding Nonfiction for Children (Awards))]], or a Gothic cathedral. [[ASIN:006115430X Universe of Stone: Chartres Cathedral and the Invention of the Gothic AKA Universe of Stone: A Biography of Chartres Cathedral]].  Knowing this is very helpful to appreciating what you see when you get there.  Lonely Planet can't really cover stuff like that.  It does have useful tips, some stuff on hotels, restaurants, etc.  For Delhi, you're better off finding a cabbie who can take you around.  I actually had dinner with the tour guide I had for my visit to a palace in Jaipur.  He was a good guy.  Another reviewer likes the Rough Guide more.  OK, it has 8 pages on Fatehpur Sikri.  But you really want more than that, to be ready to visit that place.  Sure, I tied threads to the window around Salim Chisti's tomb, what the heck.  If you are doing a tourist trip to India, the north is a good place to go, and this book is fine, I think.  India is very, very different from the US, or even Europe.  I was mostly unable to get my clothes washed, so I had to do them in the sink, and let them dry.  It is better not to walk the streets of big cities.  The women were begging- for baby formula, which costs, for them, by comparison, some outlandish amount, probably what Cocaine costs here.  A guy asked me, \\"You like boy? You like girl?\\"  I said, \\"Thanks, I like my health\\" and moved on.  When I went to train stations or airports, there was none of this National Guard recruits sitting there bored out of their skulls.  There were very alert soldiers with rifles, carefully scanning the crowd.  Do not argue with authority in India.  Be very careful about food.  Do not get ice cubes, you don't know where the water came from, and check the water bottles, to be sure they're sealed- they might have been refilled with questionable water.  Years ago, my parents were in a restaurant, on this side of the world, and they saw that sewage water was used to wash dishes. Books are holy in India, they do not put books on the floor.  If you go, you might consider taking your favorite kind of books, say self-help.  They like American books in India.  Oddly enough, they like American books on Yoga- the paper and pictures are better, they tell me, and they like the new perspective.  They drive in Delhi about the way they drive in Cairo- the driver only looks ahead.  Do not try to rent a car here.  Do not assume that India is like the US, it is not.  When you get your passport photo taken, if you are male, have a tie on.  For women, wear something conservative.  This matters.  Dress conservatively. Your appearance will still broadcast TOURIST, but not as much.  Do not carry a wallet.  Put money in your front pants pockets, the 20's or equivalent on one side, and smaller bills on the other.  Do NOT flash your cash.  There are people who can razor open a purse in 1 second, and have the wallet out and gone in another second.  Project your awareness out at least 30 yards, and be aware of everything around you.  I'm not saying to be afraid- but if you were in an area of say Los Angeles, or NY City, that seemed a bit seamy, you would not wander around in a daze.  Don't do that here.  I had no problems in India when I was there, and I enjoyed it.  I wouldn't stop at the tips in this book- read several books, maybe some websites, and put it all together.  Know that whatever place your tour or cabbie stops at for souvenirs gives a 10% cut to the driver.  If you ask the driver- they will tell you where to get stuff cheaper, also.  [[ASIN:0761454845 CultureShock! India: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette (Cultureshock India: A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)]] is helpful, also.

When we look at stories like this, from [[ASIN:1577315936 The Hero with a Thousand Faces (The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell)]] models, they are always metaphors, at several levels.  Green is the heart.  When you are centered in your heart, you can do a lot.  The ring is intent.  The imaging of the green ray is straight out of [[ASIN:0875168116 The Neville Reader: A Collection of Spiritual Writings and Thoughts on Your Inner Power to Create an Abundant Life]].  Yellow is the conscious mind, fear, analysis, monkey mind, and of course it interferes with heart.  I had read these as a kid, and it wasn't until Dr. Richard Bartlett [[ASIN:1582702381 Matrix Energetics: The Science and Art of Transformation]] started talking about the archetypal aspects, that I realized there were multiple levels.  There is a scene where Hal tells Jason how much he loves flying. Hal encourages Jason to close his eyes and relive a no-hitter he pitched.  This is where the ring [intent] chose Hal- intent is the feeling of it already done.  It is interesting that one of the Oans was missing; kind of like [[ASIN:B00000JPH6 The Dark Crystal]].  I don't enjoy many movies made for adults, they tend to be shallow.  Movies like this reach deep into the mythical, archetypal mind.  I love them.

It was much harder to follow along, especially when you start reading about Dany. Martin has created such a rich and detailed world here and to be able to keep up with everything requires notes and diagrams! Maybe too much was revealed and it was too political in book two? I don't know.<br /><br />With all that said though, the book is awesome! There is something for everyone in these books. Action, romance, drama, espionage... it's all there.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what happens to our heroes and villains in the coming books and I have a feeling things really just got started.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Revision: 01/2013 -<br /><br />If you're thinking about buying the book, just read the negative reviews instead. They are FAR more entertaining and for the most part, better quality writing.<br /><br />************************<br /><br />I read the reviews before purchasing this book, decided not to because there is nothing I hate more than bad writing making the best sellers list, and the reviews seemed to lean that way. But then a girlfriend said YOU HAVE TO READ THIS! So I did.<br /><br />I wish I could get my $10 back.<br /><br />I did finish the book, to be fair, where on many other occasions I have not even bothered. It is entertaining and steamy enough to get you to turn the pages. Unfortunately, the sex is pretty much the only thing appealing about the book, and even that was often redundant and nothing special. The writing was repetitive and amateur and the plot unoriginal. Beyond the simple writing issues that probably could have been cured by better editing, were deeper underlying issues I found extremely disturbing. Christian is overbearing, possessive, violent and essentially stalks Ana. However, because he's a handsome billionaire Ana has no qualms with him tracing her cell phone to find out where she is, knowing her home address before she has told him, or following her to Georgia when she goes to visit her mom because she needs some space. I'm sorry, but as an independent woman in a healthy, loving relationship, these possessive, needy, overbearing traits that Christian posesses are not appealing to me in any way.
B000TETD9Q|5.0|This is a pretty comprehensive -early- Beach Boy collection for me.<br />It has all the old familiar tunes, listening is like going back to my old hometown.<br />As comfortable as memories of family, friends across the street, high school football games and a first real kiss.<br /><br />For those complaining about the mono versions on this collection, I guess you just weren't there. LOL You will just never know the real Beach Boys. For all the weeks and months they spent agonizing over the production of each newly released tune, they also knew that their production values had to mesh with the lowest common denominator as far as playback. While they had $1000 stereo studio monitors they knew the truth of the matter was that in the wild the music would be replayed on less than state of the art equipment. 99% of the time that 'perfect' new tune would be heard in a teenagers room on a hand me down mono \\"HI-FI\\" or a ragged old Wurlitzer JukeBox at the malt shop or pool hall. Even more likely it would be heard in a car. That was where the ear was tuned to hear each nuance and hear we did with a sensitivity that was gone by age 21. Its true, youth is largely wasted on the young.<br />With the Beach Boys records receiving their fair (payola) share of air time, Good Vibrations could be heard as often as every 15 mins if you wanted. Good Vibrations lived up to its name as it shook the tiny speakers and rattled the metal dashboard of the car. Those old cars we drove had state of the art automotive audio systems represented by transistors nearly as large as the vacuum tubes they replaced and blasting out thru a single 3\\"x7\\" dashboard speaker. That old speaker would have a jagged 2\\" tear in the flapping paper cone and varying flexibility due to beer spills.<br />THAT was the best we had with which to hear the Beach Boys! They were the sound that mattered. They were the sound that helped shape our young lives, and curiously for my generation, -always- in a positive way.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie, alas, did not come to my local theater. Apparently local taste does not run to British verbal humor and charm; around here, the market is for anything animated, films where humans are killed or dismembered and the understated subtlety of Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell comedies. Of course, the lack of an audience for Indo-British films might be because we have no Indians and only two British-born inhabitants (I am one of the Brits). I'm sure others living in rural areas have found the same. I eventually caught the movie on a long plane trip and was happy to while away the hours in the company of Maggie Smith, Judy Dench and co. As all travelers will know, planes aren't the ideal venue for movies, given the ambient noise, the person in the next seat wanting to use the restroom and the delivery of meals at the most crucial points in the plot, so I'm looking forward to seeing the DVD at home.<br /><br />I did see and hear enough to know that this is a charming film. The British members of the cast, all well-seasoned veterans of many movies and TV series, play their parts convincingly and with relish, especially the inimitable Dame Maggie Smith. Such is the stock of mature British actors that a whole genre of film-making (Old Britcoms) would be possible and would find a ready audience among baby-boomers. However, the movie was raised out of the ordinary for me by a marvelous performance by Dev Patel, the young Indian actor, whose boundless energy, infectious enthusiasm and never-say-die attitude give the film a wonderfully uplifting mood.<br /><br />I can't say this movie has caused me to want to move to Jaipur (even at Sonny's prices), although I am fast approaching the age when a move might be on the cards, but if he ever decides to open a sister hotel in this area, I'll be checking it out. Do yourself a favor and check this movie out, it's delightful.

This book was easily one of the most BORING books I have ever read - the characters are predictable and one dimensional, the plot is lifeless, and the writing is absolute crap. I made it through about five chapters until I threw my hands up and decided enough of my life had been wasted. Even fast forwarding to the naughty parts didn't help - boring, boring, BORING. I'm just grateful I didn't have to spend my own money.

What a mistake that was.  Over a month later, after only doing the video 2 times, I have serious back pain and have an appointment to go see a chiropractor.  It hurts so badly.  I have NEVER in my life had back pain, so this isn't some old thing that flared up again.  I have always been happy to not have endured that headache of a problem, seeing other people around me with chronic back problems.  I guess I will now have to join them after this experience.  It's really depressing.  My advice?  Stay away from this video.  It is over the top and not safe in my opinion.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Hi guys, this is my first time reviewing a movie.<br /><br />I'm not a big time professional reviewer or anything but..<br /><br />I have just watched the avengers tonight earlier at 8:00pm (Fourth of July 2012).... and it was spectacular. The story was compelling and interesting; the movie actors did a wonderful awesome job, there was a lot of hard work, and humor put in the movie, which made it even better than other no-joke serious action movies out there.. I have no more to say than this movie's got the complete package of satisfaction. A trio of super heroes in one movie.. Epic.. The were a lot of cool scenes where they all fight alongside with each other, and there where some parts where they even faced off and parred against each other because of disagreements, confusion, and etc. I have already watched the other marvel movies that included Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America; Thor & Captain America being few of the most important.. In my opinion, you guys should watch marvel's superhero movies that are connected to The Avengers just to get a little heads-up on what's going on and how Avengers came to be. Anyway, movie was seriously worth watching; I say no more.. I'm preordering already. :)<br /><br />Have a good one guys-- If you all haven't watched The Avengers yet, go plan ahead of time and watch it. If you folks haven't watched the other marvel movies, now's a good time to catch up a bit.. So yeah, don't miss out watching it on the monster screen with food, drinks, & popcorn.<br /><br />-William

B005IZLPKQ|2.0|I'm giving this film 2 stars because I simply couldn't sit through the second hour of the film and wanted to give it some benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />What forced me to choose not to finish the film:<br />The film starts out ok, but after the experiment, the film just gets cheesy and stupid.  You're greeted by dumb one-liners that aren't funny and the film gets tiring incredibly fast.  If the dialogue had been predictable, that would have been fine, but it was unpredictably dumb.<br /><br />Frankly, it seems that whoever wrote the script just thought: \\"I've got to get all these different elements of CA in the film - how can I do that as quickly as possible.\\"<br /><br />I'll say this: if you have a child who has no concept of WW2, military matters, how to hold and fire a gun, and can't understand the English language: they very well might enjoy this film.

B0059XTTW8|3.0|I'm a big fan of both the books of John le Carre and most of the film adaptations.  Understandably, films must  compress certain elements of plot, perhaps character, in order to fit a certain time constraint.  The two British mini-series of Tinker Tailor and Smiley's People had the luxury of really getting it more right and of having Sir Alec Guinness in the lead.  Certainly, this latest Tinker Tailor would have been helped with an extra 20 minutes or  more, but much more problematic are a couple of changes from the novel that seem utterly peculiar and  unnecessary.  Peter Guillam, a more significant character in the novel, is undeniably a ladies' man, not a gay man weeping at the thought of losing his lover.  Ricki Tarr cares for the Russian spy Irina, yes, but is more vulnerable as a hunted man because of his deep love for his young daughter Danny and her mother (who \\"seems to lead the pack [of wives]\\" during the story); neither are mentioned or appear in the current  film.  Both changes appear to be made to reap a kind of romantic notion of loss not present in either the novel or the British adaptation for these two characters.  The same seems to be true in the 2011 cinematic treatment of Jim Prideaux, perhaps the most betrayed.  In the novel/mini-series, he is seen to return to his teaching position, healing and apparently finding peace, but the current film leaves him lonely and bitter, turning violently against the young Bill Roach, originally the character most responsible for \\"saving\\" Jim.<br /><br />Most egregious, however, are in the changes to George Smiley, who visibly blanches and physically staggers at both the observed betrayal by his adulterous wife Anne and her dreary, pathetic return at the current film's end.  Where's Sian Phillips when we need her?!  That, along with Smiley's smug face as he takes his place of power in the final scene, undercut the world-weary, brilliant and quite modest yet powerful character that le Carre so memorably envisioned in this first of his Smiley trilogy.<br /><br />Adaptations necessarily leave out, combine, or otherwise alter material from novels into film.  These alterations ought to makes sense, however, and remain true to the essence of plot and character, particularly in the case of an acknowledged masterpiece.  Alas, a conversation with scriptwriters about these changes can't happen, so I'm just enjoying the current film by taking it at face value and forgetting its genesis; I've got the book and mini-series on DVD if i want to get a really big thrill -- again.
B007ZZKWHY|3.0|While this film was being made, a few teaser clips were released onto YouTube. From the fans' comments on these, it seems that many of them \\"wanted the Nazis to win.\\" Even this reviewer hoped that this independent film might do what no Hollywood film will ever do -- give a neutral, or at least a thoughtful examination of the National Socialist Weltanschauung. But that opportunity was missed.<br /><br />It's blindingly obvious that this film is a spoof. Indeed, some of its themes, that are so forcefully imposed onto present-day Western society, are portrayed in such \\"over the top\\" fashion that I wonder whether the director is slyly hinting at how ridiculous they really are. For example:--<br /><br />i) Moon Nazis Oberführer Klaus Adler and Earthologist Renate Richter are a couple well aware of their Aryan racial compatibility, and their destiny to have children of the highest racial quality. However both are subsequently attracted, without a second thought, to members of other races, fully conforming to the tired old stereotypes of \\"blonde White woman + Black man\\" and \\"White man + Asian woman.\\"<br /><br />ii) Black astronaut James Washington knows that the primary reason he was chosen for the first US mission to the moon in 50 years is because he is (in his own opinion) \\"pretty.\\" He is actually a male model. Technical competence is evidently not required -- an obvious reference to the political correctness that has now overwhelmed the US space program, or what passes for one these days.<br /><br />iii) With reference to the \\"racial differences are only skin deep\\" diktat, and with a nod perhaps to Jewish author Maurice Samuel's view that you cannot \\"make an Aryan of a negro by painting him with ochre,\\" the moon Nazis inject Washington with \\"Albinisierer,\\" which turns his skin white. Thereafter, they regard him as an Aryan!<br /><br />There are other examples, some subtle, others not. Most moon Nazis have ridiculous titles and incongruous names. (\\"Adler\\" is a typically Jewish surname. His Asian would-be lover and subsequent enemy is Vivian Wagner, presumably named after that most \\"anti-semitic\\" classical composer).<br /><br />While the film generally moves along at a good pace, and the CGI effects are often impressive given the film's small budget, any attempt to take it even semi-seriously must run up against the question: \\"Why would National Socialists who have escaped to the moon want anything more to do with Earth?\\" Although Renate Richter has a naïve, proselytising view of National Socialism (\\"... when we return to those who need our help\\"), surely Nazis possessing a viable Space Drive would have used it decades ago to move outwards, and to begin to colonise the galaxy. For them, the decaying, degenerate, dishonest, dishonorable and increasingly lethal Earth would surely be strictly quarantined, as an excellent object lesson in what happens to a planet that has repudiated National Socialism.

It makes the case that for every society, it is its ability to include its population and allow for individuals to benefit from and influence the broader group is the most important factor in promoting growth and progress.  Extractive societies reduce the incentive to innovate and create viscious cycles the prevent progress and stifle growth.<br /><br />The authors start with a simple example of a place called Nogales which border the US and Mexico.  They make the observation that the wealth on one side of the border is very different from the other despite the populations having the same ancestry.  With this as a first case example the authors go on to discount various other developement theories for example ignorance, cultural theories as well as those based on geography, in particular the thesis from Guns Germs and Steel.<br /><br />The authors then start to describe their theory of the importance of institutional arrangements and their effect on incentives.  They give historical accounts and show how the repurcussions of events (like the plague) split the dynamics of similar economic backdrops into subgroups who subsequently evolved differently.  In particular the authors make the point that historical events that improve the bargaining position of members of society to increase plurality society can undergo virtuous cycles which continue the process and propel people forward together.<br /><br />The authors give accounts of life in extractive societies and inclusive societies through history to make their points.  For exclusive they include Mayan civilization, Stalin, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Argentina, the US South, the list goes on.  For inclusive their main focus is on England and the Glorious Revolution where power was redistributed away from the King towards the supporting court and how their diverse interests created a natural balance of power. The authors describe how inclusive societies have a natural system of checks and balances that is quite stationary in time and include the example of Roosevelt trying to pack the Supreme court which is prevented.  The authors point is that the institutional arrangements in society and how power is distributed through society are the driving forces of progress or stagnation.  This is definitely true; the ingrediants for the inclusive pluralistic society many would like to see though are not given as the authors do not have them and dont believe they are unique.  This is the larger failure of the book.  It is all well and good to discuss how society can succeed and how it can fail but in the absence of tackling how the initial conditions can be set and how to overcome their \\"iron law of oligarchy\\" the insight is the same as many have given through different but similar words.  Fukuyama has recently written about inclusive/exclusive in origins of political order in which the recipe is to cut nepotism- that is perscriptive for example.  Violence and the Social order by North also discusses many similar subjects as the authors.  This lens to analzye progress and the conditions required for progress is well thought out but it is far from ground breaking and the authors lack of focus on how they think one can change the conditions makes this a course in history more than anything else.  Education for example could be considered as the seeds of creating the human capital required for efficient and political organization (though the author dismiss education as relevant in this by citing examples of educated populations which are defined by exclusive politics- though i think these examples are very bad ones and dont remotely prove their point).  There is much food for thought in the book and i really enjoyed reading it and the analysis.  It is not the next wealth of nations despite what one of the prasie for the author comments states.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I thought this would just be a tutorial because it was free but once I played it. it is an awesome game
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it. I kept playing it. the animals are nice so cute. I love all the animals. it kept me playing and completing every family
0307341577|5.0|This book was amazing. The author gave so much detail and depicted the lives of the Day family so well. The story was compelling and kept me reading. It was told from 3 points of view and it's not until the end all three stories tie together to a shocking twisted conclusion. Highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a mystery thriller. Great summer read!
0345529057|4.0|The set came in great condition.  Each book has been an awesome read.  I have not read the books yet but my husband has.  Not having read any type of books in years I decided to get these for him for father's day.  He has not been able to put them down and will take the current book he is working on with him places. This is how I know that they must be great.
0071762345|5.0|I just finished reading Dave's book after trying to develop my own social media strategy. While reading the book, I literally took notes after every page turn. It was packed with so much information and ideas that I practically wrote a book of my own in the process.<br /><br />I love the use of case studies and how the book is set up.<br /><br />If you are looking to develop a social media strategy on Facebook, or any other social network, I highly recommend you pick up this pool. It was totally worth the time and continues to serve as a reference book.<br /><br />Excellent work Dave! I learned a ton :-)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was torn about the first part of this book.  It seemed a little slow compared to the rest of the books in the series, but man did it finish strong!  The book turns out to be my favorite of the series mainly because of the epilogue at the end.  I'm so happy the way it turned out!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very fun game~ cool that you can replay the games to get more coins :) kids love playing this game also
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game and so easy to Learn. the graphics are great as well. I just wish they gave u more energy.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|reminiscent of Sims but more interesting.  who knew tapping animals could be so fun...  would be nice if it where a little faster pace.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's a nice app to use when you just want to check the weather.  Works great on the kindle fire!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|WARNING: This is not your typical Snow White fairytale. It is an awesomely dark version of the story with unexpected twists (twists that you may or may not be okay with) I won't spoil it for you, you will just have to watch it to find out!Yes, it took me a while to see her as Snow White instead of a Twilight character but once I was able to do so, I realized how well she played this part. And Thor, I mean the Huntsman, did a fantastic job in his role as well. A TAD bit of storyline and dialogue was missing from the film but it got a star back for it's amazing cinematography and graphics. The visual aspect of the film was incredibily artistic and breathtaking. It has action, a few jokes, and a tiny bit of romance. That was the only thing that made me groan at the end; the lack of romance. If you're not a sap you won't care. But I was hoping for a good make out scene. lol. You may not want to own it, as I surely will, but I would definitely reccommend watching it once for the pure enjoyment.<br /><br />P.S I am tempted however to dock a star because of K. Stewart. She is supposed to be playing the most innocent purest girl and she couldn't be more on the opposite side of the spectrum. She couldn't even finish the movie without cheating with the married producer of Snow White. Not to mention that dirty little mouth of hers. So yes it shouldn't matter, but her personal life interferes with the experience for me. Annoyed...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|was worried when I read some reviews.  yes the counters messed up but eventually they went back to their original state and the game has been great since then! this game is really fun!
B0006GQMC8|5.0|Just wondering why this DVD is so expensive? $30 compared to other films on Amazon half this price!<br /><br />It's a wonderful film and I have enjoyed it many times. Great story, characters, acting and locations. But I don't see how it's worth twice as much as most movies.
B004UID2LC|5.0|When I bought my kindle I was thinking there was some possible easy way of getting my itunes music on my kindle....it wasn't that easy though so I was kind of lost I had only like 15 songs on my tablet! But then I found this app and now I have about 200 songs on my kindle!!!! This is the best app EVER!! GET IT!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book.  It is not for children or even young adults, but the story holds your interest.  I did feel the need to continue with the next two books.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|Thought the first book was intriguing and pushed boundaries, second and third were a waste of time. Boring, nothing happened and strung together with R18 scenes that were in the end annoying and you wanted to get out with the plot.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|\\"Once more into the fray, into the last good fight I'll ever know, live and die on this day, live and die on this day\\", this is the message this film is trying to get across... survival, Ottway also trys to get this message across to the other survivors of the downed plane, yes, there are flaws in this film, boldly shot in British Columbia, coincidentally \\"the edge\\" was also filmed in Canada...the point is, this film is entertaining, in no way boring, not to mention a huge box office hit praised with mostly positive reviews. The pack wolves are another story reminding the viewer of Anthony Hopkins' remake of \\"wolfman\\", these wolves on here are the size of grizzlys with glowing green eyes, maybe real wolves would have fared better.  Liam Neeson is top-notch as always, watching carefully you wonder if Neeson really had a good supporting cast surrounding him, maybe one more top-billing actor, Bale, Pitt, Crowe... nevertheless, it's Neeson all the way... \\"The Grey\\" is what it is, controversial, nothing more than a strong code in which everyone has to follow, the footsteps of life are short and narrow, watch each careful step.
B0086700CM|4.0|I have totally been waiting for this game but I'm not sure about it because it hogs all my battery on my kindle fire but I do recommend it its entertaining
030758836X|5.0|I absolutely COULD NOT put this book down. I am not going to say anything about the story because their are some major twists and turns, and I don't want to spoil it for you. But it was amazing. READ IT!!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Don't pass this one up.  Great puzzle game with a simple concept.  Get rid of the red shapes,  but keep the green ones. Highly recommended!
B002JF1N0A|5.0|This \\"150th Anniversary Edition\\" seems to be simply a reprint of the 100th Anniversary Edition.  In particular, the forward by Julian Huxley was written in 1958 and while it is still mostly relevant, it has dated badly in a few places.<br /><br />The main text is Darwin's 6th Edition.<br /><br />Darwin considerably amended Origin of Species through the course of its six editions.  For example he first used the expression \\"survival of the fittest\\" (coined by Herbert Spencer) in the 5th edition and he first used the term \\"evolution\\" in the 6th edition.  However, he also diluted some of his arguments in an attempt to deflect criticism.  Most notably he made more allowance for now discredited Lamarckian ideas of hereditable affects of use and disuse, versus pure natural selection.<br /><br />It is an open argument whether the 1st edition or the 6th edition best represents his real thinking.  My 2 cents would be that the differences are relatively minor in the context of the overall work. The key driving ideas are well expressed in both and either is a fine start.  Just be aware that other readers of Origin of Species may have seen a slightly different text!
B0086700CM|5.0|I really enjoy this game because it is free and a fun way to pass time. I would highly recommend this game
B0079XPUOW|3.0|I have read and liked other books by John Scalzi, but I found Redshirts to be just average. The plot was rather simple as was the dialogue.
0425263908|5.0|Great post Fifty book. The only negative about this series it that it is too long to wait until the 2nd book comes out.
0439023513|3.0|For about 2 - 3 weeks after finishing Mockingjay I was depressed. I wanted to write my own alternate ending to this horrific book. It was so depressing, disappointing, and absolutely disconnected. It is almost as if Suzanne Collins didn't write this book. Everything that enveloped Hunger Games and Catching Fire was gone from Mockingjay. It was so so sad to read this. I kept reading, hoping for Peeta to return, hoping for things to turn up, but it never really did. And it ended. Just like that, ever so abruptly.<br /><br />THIS BOOK DOES NOT DO JUSTICE TO THE TRILOGY!!!<br /><br />Three quarters of this book is depressed, unsure Katniss and war. Lots of war. It was just ever so disappointing to see what had become of Peeta. Even after being rescued, he never returned to his normal self. Being the rock and support for Katniss. I hate that plot. It didn't help that Prim and Finnick were killed too! Finnick....oh I feel so bad for Annie. It was heart breaking. The epilogue doesn't even do justice to wrap up this trilogy. Again, I thought over and over, this is just not like the first 2 books, it feels so different and so disconnected. Like someone else wrote it or something.<br /><br />How frustrating, to invest time into a beautiful love story as well as a story of growth, sacrifice and war and to have it end like this.
B007Z9QA8K|4.0|Had no expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  Was very light and funny to watch the characters going through their experiences.
0553579908|3.0|Let me start by saying I loved A Game of Thrones and I couldn't put Clash of Kings down during anything to do with Tyrion, Catelyn, Renly, or Stannis, etc. That's not the point, I'm sure several other people have used an indefinite amount of adjectives and similes to praise their love for this book and everything in it. For those parts I fall right in line.<br />The bad: Daenerys... and to a lesser extent Jon (but hear me out).<br />In A Game of Thrones I accepted Daenerys as a legitimate character and was interested in her portion of the story. It seemed that she was connected to Westeros in some meaningful way. People there actually mentioned her and (indirectly) interacted with her. She was tied to the story and her arc seemed to be building to something grander particularly with her climax in hatching the dragons. She might be a major player in this game of thrones!<br />However in A Clash of Kings I began to find it more and more difficult to actually read the Daenerys chapters. She no longer had any connection to the main plot, I don't remember if she was mentioned by anyone on Westeros even once in the story. Her story also slowed to a crawl. She gained some followers (not many) but lost some; she traveled to a city and sat but then left for another city where she sat. She may have had some interactions in both, more so in the second involving some maegi people. None of it seemed to have any meaning. The certain characters may or may not have had ties to parts of the lore, but otherwise were meaningless words on meaningless pages while I strived to stay awake until the end of that chapter - the good part. Seriously, if she has no part in the story then why is she there, especially if it destroys the pacing of the rest of the story?<br />Jon's parts also seemed to create rifts in the overall pacing for me, and I ended up dreading his chapters. Don't get me wrong, I love his character and what's happening in his story, but it slowed down much too far during his chapters.<br />If I may, I'd also like to bring up the fact that in this series there doesn't seem to really be any overarching plotline whatsoever. Sure the beings from beyond the wall seem to be getting ready for some sort of invasion (maybe) and that is a big part of Jon's storyline, so the book does keep an overarching plot doesn't it? Then what does the rest of the book have to do with anything? Yes it is an alive world where things happen that aren't connected to anything else, but if I'm going to spend the hours out of my day to read a 900+ page book in a series of 900+ page books, dammit make everything be MEANINGFUL to me and to the story. For me right now, I might just as well read a detailed book on various presidents of the United States or leaders of other countries.<br />But maybe it's because I'm not a fan of soap operas and boiling down all the elements of this and its predecessor reveals this as such.chapters.<br />If I may, I'd also like to bring up the fact that in this series there doesn't seem to really be any overarching plotline whatsoever.

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Holy wowzorama. This album is reaffirming my will to live. I kid you not. Didn't love it on first listen. Now on about the fourth time through and hooked. It totally has typical Fiona things in it so I don't understand why some fans don't like it and say it doesn't sound like her. The lyrics are even more fantastic than usual and  it is sung so powerfully and passionately and confidently awesomely. I feel it like no other Fiona album. And I love her other albums. Its awesome that its stripped down, because her most powerful instrument, her voice, is always the centerpiece. I am in awe. Thank you Fiona, for the first album in years that as given me chills. This is totally art-pop music and her voice melts and dances around it.. And the album works so amazingly as a whole. I think a lot of people have lost grasp of what makes a great complete album. ok i'll stop gushing. this is just wow. fiona masterpiece
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book have to read all three in series!Good plot keeps you turning the pages to see whats next! read catching fire and mockingjay all good books
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy and fun to play.  great way to unwind after a day if work or play.  I love that u can go back and fix a move
0545265355|5.0|Read the first book out of curiosity.  Had seen the adds for the movie.  Couldn't wait to read the rest.  A truly enjoyable trilogy. Really enjoyable.
B008B3H4VQ|3.0|What can I say...I love Linkin Park and love the beats and the electronic influence, but often this falls flat. I'm not singing along or remembering much of this album, minus a few tracks- here's hoping that remix album, much like Reanimation is coming down in the future- because that would rock.  My biggest gripe is why oh why can't Linkin Park make songs that last longer....especially when the song works. It's frustrating when the song is sooooo short. expand a little bit boys. That said, when it works it works.
1600243916|4.0|I am a fan when anyone gives Malcom Gladwell the opportunity to talk because he loves the stuff he writes about.  The fact that they let him do the audiobook makes it a lot of fun.  The wow factor and practical usable knowledge in this book aren't as great as the Tipping Point or Blink. It did make me evaluate my own life-experience and see where I am an Outlier.  I give the book 4 stars because i feel he could have done a better job with the idea behind the book.<br />Positives<br />+ Author reads the book, he's excited about his own work.<br />+ Well written, the story and flow of the book are great.<br />+ The subject matter is interesting- people who excel in a field have had vast experiences/prolonged exposure within a field.<br />Downers<br />- Not Malcolm's greatest writing<br />- Lacking the \\"applicable\\" ideas (things that you could implement for change in an organization or life.)
B003VANOFY|1.0|These are some of the worst gaming headphones I have ever owned. I \\"upgraded: from the G35 when those shorted out thinking the 930's would be quite a bit better. First off they aren't. There is very little difference in sound between the G35 and 930's. However, this isn't the reason I am saying not to buy them. No, the reason not to buy them is due to technical issues. They constantly drop connection even if you have them plugged in to the charger. It is the single most annoying thing I have ever run into with a headset. This problem has gotten worse the longer I've had them (I've only had them a few months)  Do some research on them, these problems have not been \\"fixed\\" with any driver updates and the problem has existed for well over a year. Considering that I bought my pair in 2012 yet I am finding complaints about this issues dating back into early 2011 I can only shake my head.<br /><br />Buyer Beware!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is one of the most incredible movies ever made.  It is unfortunate it was a flop, poor adverting plan by disney mostly the name.  However this is a great DVD package that is well worth the money!
0060899190|5.0|When I purchased this book in 2005 I was in an \\"emo\\" phase and looking for anything to make me more sad.  Now, 7 years later, I found it in a box as I was moving and I read through it again and it did the opposite.  It's a great book and I've still looked at the site on occasion.  My girlfriend read it and loves it!  It's great food for thought and it may even encourage some people not to hold back their secrets as in a lot of cases letting those secrets out may turn into positive changes in your life.  Love it, still worth every penny!  I think there were some other PostSecret books that came out, I'll have to go look for them now!
6305428352|5.0|I saw this movie on TV for the first time and, knowing nothing about it, wasn't expecting much.  While I am a weeper, I was actively sobbing at the end.  It's a beautifully-acted film about dreams and the importance of nurturing those dreams, and a man who feels that life has cost him his.  The bow it ties at the end isn't entirely neat, either, which was a believable touch.  A very worthwhile watch.
B007JVJ3C4|3.0|I liked the first movie better than this. This second movie as if there is no plot at all. The action is good, the effects are good but I can't find any resolution why they made another movie that doesn't even have a good story line. In my opinion, this is like a prequel of the first movie, why? it's a total setback. I gave 3 stars because, for effects, for action and for the new partner in producing this movie. Anything besides that, it's all up to your guess.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Lots of fun even if longer than most solitaire games!Repeating lost spider games is an excellent learning tool<br />for the beginner spider solitatire player.
B003Y5H5BA|1.0|The entire movie is just a sectional comedy that don't have good thing to remember or tell anything good and funny about this movie to your friends. It was only interesting because of the actors. Besides that, it's a slapstick comedy.
0393064476|5.0|This is a wonderful book that informs and educates while it involves and amuses.  The audio version of this book is wonderful and I listened to it with rapt attention.  I bought this for my dad for Father's Day and he enjoyed it too.

B00729Z6R4|5.0|I had been hearing clips from this release on internet radio so I had to order it. The CD arrived quickly in great condition and has been played numerous times. I have not been disappointed. This is classic 80's style rock in a new package by a talented goup of new artists. If this is your style of music, don't waste any more time, check this one out!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book was so much better than the first one. There was a little less steam and a lot more story! The first one pulled you in, but this one makes you want to keep reading!

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I loved this book. It starts out a little slow, but when it gets going it just doesn't stop. I stayed up late reading, then went to work and spent my lunch break reading! I couldn't put it down.<br />There's enough detail to visualize the story, but not so much that you get overwhelmed. The characters all work well together; my favorite being Charles of course.<br />I can't wait to read the second one when it comes out!
0062197258|4.0|Catherine is a happy go lucky party girl when she meets Lee.  Handsome, mysterious and sexy he seems to be Mr. Perfect.  But her dream man soon becomes her worst nightmare.  As he insinuates himself into her life, his dark side emerges.  Subjeced to his control and dominance, Catherine becomes a woman haunted and hunted.  Lee has isolated her and turned her friends against her.  After nearly killing her, he is sent to prison.  Catherine lops off her hair and shortens her name and moves to another town.  Plagued by anxiety, she develops obsessive compulsive disorder to cope with her lack of security.  When a handome psychologist moves into her building, she has a chance at love and life. With his encouragement, she enters therapy.  She is making progress when the newly freed Lee reemerges with a deadly agenda.<br /><br />I liked this book.  Lee's transformation is believable as is Catherine's descent into mental illness.  It did run a bit long and dragged in the middle. However, it picks up at the end as Catherine, stll fragile but stronger, confronts Lee. Catherine is very real and I liked that the author did not make her a goody goody, too strident or whiny.  Her embarrassment at her predicament and her illness are palpable.  The author does not condescend but provides a memorable portrayal of one woman's fight for life, liberty and love.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Honestly, I enjoy a good steamy scene... but there was a little too much in this book. I mean, let the girl catch her breath now and then. lol I did have to skip one of the scenes though, it was too gross for me! (I'm sure if you've read it you already you know which one...)<br /><br />I haven't actually looked at the books to see the format, but listening to it on audio was a little annoying when it came to the emails.<br /><br />From: Christian Grey<br />Subject: Random<br />Time: 19:23<br />To: Anastasia Steel<br /><br />(Reading Message contents)<br /><br />Christian Grey<br />CEO Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc.<br /><br />They read all of that to you each time!! ugh. I thought I wasn't going to be able to finish it. But in the end, the story line caught my attention and I've already downloaded the next one so I can see what happens!
0316067598|4.0|I am at half way point in this book. I found it very straight from the heart, no non-sense write-up. The book opens with Marcus' growing up, pass thru his SEAL training thru mid-way, and now has started building up towards Operation Redwing.<br /><br />The book is very gripping. I took one star away from too much context building (about half the book). Maybe that's how it was meant to be (and his pride in SEAL program shows), however, it didn't meet all my expectations.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This is one of the few books that in the end skips to the future for a glimpse of how their lives turned out. You aren't left hanging, wondering what could have been. Good series. However, I don't understand all the hype about the series as far as it being banned from certain stores, etc. There is nothing in this book that isn't in 100's of other books...
B000VDDWDS|2.0|This review is for those of you who already know this is a great movie with a great soundtrack...but are considering upgrading from a DVD to this Blu Ray for an expected boost in video quality.<br /><br />Don't bother with this \\"upgrade.\\"  The video quality of this blu ray is no better than my DVD (tested on a 60 inch plasma HDTV).  Very disappointing...
0071752854|5.0|Pitch Anything is one of those unique books that presents a technique then provides several real world examples of the technique. Klaff uses positive examples and negative examples so you know what to do and what not to do. For the first chapter I was a little skeptical but then saw how effectively he used categorization to later deliver his message.  You can tell Klaff took considerable time to organize the book and write the material without extra fluff.  When presenting the content, Klaff used the techniques he was teaching, especially when telling his stories.  Well done.  First 5 star I have given.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved the book. I also read The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo and loved it also.  Once you start reading, you can't put it down.  I will start reading the last book from the trilogy and I bet it will be also great.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|When this movie was initially released in theaters I must have been asleep for 6 months as I don't recall previewing or hearing anything about it in print or TV ads. When my wife and I acquired a 3-d TV/DVD player the search was on for the latest videos. Honestly, I purchased this movie based entirely on customer reviews. Just about everything submitted by other consumers was very positive, so I made the purchase and all I can say is that the reviews were dead on. RIO is one of our top 5 for many reasons: Great 3-d effects, glorious colors, a story that kept us entertained to the end, a great soundtrack, on and on. This was definitely money well spent and showed me that if I'm on the fence about a future dvd purchase with no knowledge of the content, video quality, or quality of the 3-d effects, customer feedback can indeed be a useful tool.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is one of the best and most true to the word war series I have ever seen. It just doesn't deal with the war but also the human side of war. And the extras listening to the men that were actually there brought tears to my eyes..listening to how proud they were to have defended life,liberty and happiness. They were and are the Band Of Brothers. Excellent addition to any movie buff collection or even better as a gift.

B005MYEPXC|5.0|As far as I am concerned, this is one of Woody Allen's best pictures. Even if you are not a fan of Allen, this movie is well-crafted and executed.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I have almost all the work of this group. All are excellent and produced with primacy. In addition to be a beautiful women, they are competent and bright in their presentations. The production is always perfect. All members are first line. It is pleasure for all hours.
B006YZOXHQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B0038AL7M4 Spirits of the Dead (Histoires extraordinaires) [Blu-ray]]][[ASIN:B00126YPAW Barbarella (Movie Tie-In with Jane Fonda Cover)]]I once thought of BARBARELLA in this fashion, but as I got older (yeah, I was there when it came out) I found it a very good film indeed.  Fonda plays it straight, and has some wonderful, witty dialogue to deliver (\\"a good many dramatic situations begin with screaming\\").  The movie itself is a riot of pop art unleashed. I'm not a big fan of Vadim, but I am a big fan of this film, as I am of SPIRITS OF THE DEAD - all the episodes (and the ONLY way to appreciate it is in its blu-ray release - it's the only way to hear two of the episodes in their very important English versions - TOBY DAMMIT is essential for Terence Stamp's dialogue - the Vadim can go either French or English, as it was shot twice, in each language)  But don't sell BARBARELLA short, and it's certainly nothing Miss Fonda has to be ashamed of.  I can't wait to see the blu-ray release, as even the laser-disc was a bit disappointing visually.  I also recommend Jean-Claude Forrest's original graphic series.  Both the film and the comic are healthily sexy and stylish.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I use these to workout, plugged into my iPod, and have been doing so for years. They stay snug, don't shake around, never fall out, whether I'm hanging nearly upside down doing a decline bench-press, or doing some running. Look at the price! They sound great, and they last longer than other, more expensive headphones I've bought. I use them all the time, 5 times per week, over an hour everyday. They don't last forever, but for the price paid for them, this is probably a best buy. I am kind of afraid that Sony will stop making them because they are \\"too simple\\" or \\"too practical.\\" I also like how unassuming they look. You see these guys working out with either the mega-huge studio headphones (huh?), or those very strange, extraterrestrial wrap-around-my-ear-weirdness things. Folks, this is where it's at. Buy a pair. Heck, buy two!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this this app. it is really great. I say this is a 5 star app really. get the app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good game some of the mini games are challenging so it isnt a waste of time really
B0083GQKQG|2.0|If you like scenes that take three times longer to play out than necessary, with lots of nothing, sitting, staring, haunted looks, confusing flashbacks and no explanation of anyone's behavior, this is the flick for you. It also helps if you are fascinated with red (no, not from bloodshed, just....red.)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not much of a reader, and deifnitely have never read these type of books. I had several friends and cooworkers telling me to read the book.  I decided to give it a try to see what all the fuss was about...neddless to say, I read all 3 books in 2 weeks. I will recommend it to all you ladies out there :)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|its cool.<br />its cool.<br />its cool.<br />its cool.<br />its cool.<br />its cool<br />its cool.<br />I luv it!<br />I luv it!<br />I luv it!
0553583182|5.0|I love this book, everyone should own a copy, and at the price the seller had it on Amazon, there is no excuse for not owning a copy.  The book is not the same as pictured, but the material inside is the same.  GREAT PRICE, AND FAST DELIVERY.

B004QOB8SY|5.0|Amazing, creative, entertaining, cannot wait for Season 3 to be issued, a very clever take on the Sherlock Holmes stories......I am a true fan.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I read this book for my Book Club.  It was emotionally exhausting, but made for great discussion at our Book Club meeting.  This was a very good read and the ending was unexpected.
B003PAXONC|5.0|A big fan of the film and en joyed adding this edition to my collection.....a great package.<br />The value was too much to pass up.....thanks to the vendor.
0345803493|1.0|The writing is simply bad.  If you want a book on BDSM, try Transformation of Tammi, The Sleeping Beauty Series, or even the Story of O.  Watch the film Secretary.  If you just want something kinky sexy, try Laurell K. Hamilton books.  I only read what I did of this book- and it was not easy to get through- because so many people have asked me for the book in the store where I work, and I like to know about what I'm selling.  I have started to suggest that people- most of whom have no clue about the book other than \\"everyone's talking about it\\"- that they read the sample on Amazon or Kindle before they buy it.  This book has only sold as it has because someone was able to stir the gossip pot.
0345803485|5.0|The book is amazing, every women in the world must read it! The author is very explicit and she writes in a manner that you have to keep reading until you finish it!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I absolutely love mahjong games of all types. This particular game won me over.It is the best mahjong puzzle game by far. When I completed the free trial I had to hurry and get the whole game. I try each puzzle to get 3 stars. I also get personal best times for each puzzle. I love it. It is an exciting game to keep you busy.  Thank you EnsenaSoft this is awesome. A must get!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|this game is fun but its not really because u have to get through every single level and its kinda boring that's all ii have to say
B0042X9L6A|2.0|I purchased the now-discontinued predecessor of this product, the SB-600, in January 2009.  I have used it for about 20 photography sessions which means I've taken a few hundred pictures with it.  And for those uses it worked well.  And I took good care of it.  but when I took it out of my camera bag last time, it would not turn on at all.  Replacing the batteries with brand new batteries did not help.  The unit seems to be completely dead.  I don't think something like this, which costs hundreds of dollars, should die after a few hundred pictures.
B0000CAQ26|3.0|I don't quite get it, Pink retained her bad ass image during the waiting period between \\"Misundaztood\\" and \\"Try This\\", she made an album with music that was actually better than its predecessor, yet its singles flopped and \\"Try This\\" sold considerably less, about 12 million copies less, than \\"Missundaztood\\". After Pink made her artistic and commercial breakthrough in 2001, everybody thought that she would stick to THAT sound, addictive pop and angst, but Pink is too complex to do something that straightforward. In order to keep going in the direction of success, she has to continually curve the ball so she can surprise fans for the next direction she decides to take. After all, she is an individual right? She doesn't like to follow the status quo? That's why she calmed down on the Linda Perry collaborations and started to heavily work with Tim Armstrong, another influential songwriter, but in the rock genre. Already Pink has made an improvement from ditching self-catharasis to self-embrace and livelyhood. The content of \\"Try This\\" is not as pretentious as that of \\"Missundaztood\\", instead of trying to please everyone with self-love and misery anthems, she put the pedal to the metal (literally) and decided to focus more on just making music that's enjoyable and not too heavy. But once again, the purpose for the album is its fatal flaw. \\"Try This\\" most likely got lukewarm reception because of the hard-rock direction she took this time around, and she again is trying to hard to prove she's an individual and instead comes off a tad bit desperate to please her eager fans. But the more she tries, the more she will be categorized with Britney and Christina. Then again look at \\"In the Zone\\" and \\"Stripped\\", their transitional albums in 2003 and 2002 respectively. Both Brit and Xtina sold millions off those records because they were themselves, as calculated as they may be, they still delivered their fans a smidgen of themselves while growing up and maturing musically. They are who they are, and Pink is trying to be something she's not. But don't pass this album without listening to its singles \\"Trouble\\", \\"God is a DJ\\" and \\"Last to Know\\" all three are highlights on the album as well as my favorite track \\"Humble Neighborhoods\\". But the problem that plagued \\"Missundaztood\\" still plagues this album, its not nearly as exciting as the singles used to promote it. So I once again urge you to download the bulk, and skip the very present fluff.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I play this game everyday &amp; have become very goodat it!! My favorite bird is the mighty eagle because he turns into a rocket when he goes down.
B00005RFAI|3.0|Pink? Is that you? Are you really the same person who debuted \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" in 1999? She was definitely a solid R&B/Hip-Hop artist, but she still couldn't break away from the Britney Spears and TLC comparisons that ensued after her promising debut. Right away you could tell she wasn't going to take it a year longer, she is her own artist and should be treated as such. So in 2001, she went another direction. She collaborated with Linda Perry, a very influential song-writer in the teen scene pop music, and created a breakthrough album titled \\"Missundaztood\\" (bad grammar intended). You would think to get away from Britney comparisons she would turn to the very opposite of her sound, but instead she rolled with it and made it her own. Surprisingly enough, going the pop direction (while still maintaing the atitude from \\"Can't Take Me Home\\", mind you) made her a star in her own right and separated her from the pack of pop music. But with singles like \\"Get the party started\\", \\"Just Like a Pill\\" and \\"Don't Let me get me\\", it would be near impossible to brush her aside as another pop-machine. She wanted to make music for real people and help them understand themselves and get others to follow suit. However, the album's purpose is it's core weakness as well. Pink wrote songs intending them to be about not only herself, but other people who feel or have felt the way she does. That's why \\"Family Portrait\\" and \\"My Vietnam\\" made their way on to the album, you would think that they would appeal to a large audience right? (at least the former does). But other than the album's singles, there's not much more to listen to. It's a common thing in a pop record, to have a mix of sensational and skippable. Unfortunately for Pink, her collaborations with Linda Perry and Steven Tyler, and the dull tracks \\"My Diary\\" and \\"Gone to California\\" (to name a few), make \\"Missundaztood\\" almost a complete album of skippable tracks. There's a lot of effort here, and that's not a bad thing, but it gets to the point of trying too hard to come across as an individual with a mission to help others. Try as you might, but listening \\"Misundaztood\\" will never be as sleek and as addictive as its singles. You're better off listening to her best tracks, and then skipping the rest.
B0058BIY1S|5.0|Sheldon invents three player chess, Raj tries a drug to rid him of his Selective Mutism, and Bernadette is used as a sort of spy while at a double date with Leonard and Priya. It is hilarious... anyone who likll ns The Big Bang Theory will love this... but be prepared to laugh... especially with Bernadette.
B00881VLCE|4.0|the puzzle choices are refreshing when compared to other puzzle apps fir kindle fire. also there are many more choices. over all quite enjoyable for the puzzle enthusiast like myself :)

B001AQO3QA|5.0|The greatest Sci-Fi movie series looks stunning in Blu-Ray.  The extras and directors cuts for each movie are worth watching.  The photos on and in the case are stunning.
B000S7XKXE|5.0|Laclos' celebrated novel \\"Les liaisons dangereuses\\" needs no comment or recommendation from me as to its literary merits and fame, which it enjoyed, along with great notoriety, well before Christopher Hampton's play or the Stephen Frears movie adaptation. But it is necessary to go to the original novel to get its full impact. I should note that I have not read any other translation of the novel, so I have no basis for comparison to other versions. On its own terms, this version reads very well and conveys the nature of each character well, through his/her letters. P.W.K. Stone notes in his foreword how much more realistic this epistolary novel is compared to the near-contemporaneous \\"Clarissa\\" by Samuel Richardson, in terms of the length of the letters in Laclos' novel compared to Richardson's, and how well each letter in Laclos' novel propels the plot. Stone notes also how we all tend to expect of a novel that the good people win and the bad people lose, but that \\"in this one virtue is defeated on every front\\".<br /><br />This Penguin edition also contains an appendix of one letter that was not included in the published novel originally. Overall, if you're interested in this novel, you'll do well with this edition.
0307594777|4.0|I read these books in the recommended order after having seen the American-made movie of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  By that time, many people had told me their impressions.  I really don't like crime novels that are not based on actual crimes, but I kept an open mind as I read, and kept second-guessing the author as we traveled through (I do that; I am still trying to figure out why Lisbeth is a twin, and where her sister is).<br /><br />Here's what I'm thinking now.  First we see a sort of embryonic book, in which a child is abused appallingly (and then we find out that another was, and the two tales \\"dovetail\\") and figures out a self-defensive posture embracing silence in many ways.  Second, we see a family and an uber-family (the magazine) going through both the supportive exercises and the abusive orgies attributable to that kind of organism.  Then we see the whole thing float rapidly, even nauseatingly, outward like the concentric circles from a brick thrown into a quiet pool:  There, in all its appalligory (my own coined word for appalling \\"glory\\") is the society, with its corruption, its coercion, and worst of all, its indiscriminate murderous self-serving unnecessary yet extreme abuse.<br /><br />From microcosm to macrocosm in three disgusting leaps.<br /><br />What a loss, the loss of Larsson.  He was definitely climbing to the beginning of something momentous and I feel utterly deprived of the chance to go clambering after him!  Maybe this orchestrated piece was an overture -- I may re-read to see if I can get a bit of extrapolated composition from the arc he writes.  RIP.
0345803485|5.0|Despite all the hype to the contrary, I found this book to be well written and spellbinding.  There is a true love story, some suspense, some action and some very sexy scenarios.  The Dom/Sub aspect of the series is a large part of the stories, but even those scenes are done with class.  This is definitely not a porn book.  You DO need to read all three books, though, in order to get closure on the story.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a great movie and I was only able to watch it on television when it came on (which was few and far between). I love this movie and the delivery service I received it with, was fantastic. The product came quickly and in great condition. Thanks!
B002IR3PSC|5.0|If your a true Jethro Tull fan you will enjoy this Video. It's a shame they would show only a Part of the Concert & not the Whole Concert. But what you do get to see is awesome.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it with the getting things done and the secret weapon system. world like a charm. strongly recommend it
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book. I was flipping through the last half of the book so quickly it was amazing! I really enjoyed it and I could feel all of the energy from the pages! Deff one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks Books!

140120841X|5.0|In an alternate 1998 in England, it seems the government has turned fascist against the people of the country and making it a police state. It is ruled by the totalitarians and taking away some people's freedom in everything from some skin color, some races, some religions and even on sexual orientations as it's causing problems for the country even after a nuclear war in some parts of the world. A masked mysterious avenger named V becomes an anti-fascist anti-government avenger who  fights for the country's freedom, he meets a lovely girl named Evey as he befriends her and falls in love with her thus the two together decide to bring freedom back to the UK.<br /><br />One of the most groundbreaking and powerful comic book stories ever told! in 1982 till 1985, writer Alan Moore (Watchmen and Saga of the Swamp Thing) with artist Danny Lloyd have made a comic story that was printed in the UK;s comic magazine known as \\"Warrior Magazine\\" from 1982 till 1985 originally in black and white. However in 1985 when the company that closed down with Warrior along with it, Moore's story was not yet complete as 2 more were to be told. So he came to the US and did work on Watchmen and Killing Joke at the same time for DC, he decided to write his last 2 stories for DC for their new second company called Vertigo which makes comics aimed at mature readers as he still wrote stories for them like Swamp Thing. In 1988 DC/Vertigo reprinted the stories as a 10 issue mini-series in color for each one and has went on to become one of the most critically acclaimed comics in history then later in 1989 became a trade paperback graphic novel which has became one of DC and Vertigo's best selling graphic novels of all time. It's a very intelligent, dark and daring sci-fi story in the Orwell and Brazil (the movie from Terry Gilliam) kind of way as it shows the idea of how we can fight against facism and an anti-political statement as it's thought provoking and unique adult storytelling which Alan Moore is known for. The writing is just excellent as is the artwork from Lloyd.<br /><br />I first read this graphic novel when i was in high school looking for cool graphic novels in Albuquerque which i would go every month to there and looked up online for what cool graphic novels to read and had to check out this, i loved it and made me think, depressed me and opened my mind. This also includes \\"Behind the painted smile\\" featuring a look behind the scenes of this remarkable work of art including sketches, sample comics from Moore/Lloyd and two short stories that were first presented in Wrrior magazine that were originally conceived as interludes to the storyline of the comics.oore is known for.

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun my bf and I love playing it! this is the only game that I can I play every day on my kindle and not get bored with it.
B0086700CM|3.0|at first i was running okay but now it freezes a lot and it annoys me...  it was good that this was free otherwise it would have been a waste of money. i hope Imangi studios fixes the feeezing thing soon or i will never buy one of their apps again.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is fantastic and fun! It passes the time in bored situations, but it takes a while to earn the coins to play the games.
1451626657|4.0|I still can't decide if this difficult and cumbersome read was worth it. It was like watching Dilbert devolve into a horror movie... I kept reading with a mounting sense of terror, I was actually biting my nails by the last few chapters.<br /><br />This novel *is* a work of genius - the repetitions that so many readers find unbearable demonstrate the way Yossarian's mind travels in circles around the traumatic events he cannot face without going completely crazy (they remind me of the writing of Connie Willis - a favorite of mine). I don't think anything else I have read has brought home the horror and senselessness of war quite like this book, and I can see why it is taught in so many literature classes, you could discuss it for hours.....<br />however, that being said... I have no desire whatsoever to open this book again.
B007V508CC|2.0|I give this 2 stars b/c at least it's well produced and I'm actually able to listen to it but, as many others have pointed out, this sounds nothing like maroon 5 (aside from adam's unique voice). This album is just \\"Sad\\" and you will want to \\"Wipe Your Eyes\\" after you say a \\"Beautiful Goodbye\\" to maroon 5 if they continue in this dance/pop genre, unless of course you like maroon 5 doing that type of music. I have nothing against the genre and even listen to some of it but I listen to maroon 5 for their songwriting talent and even more, their musical talent and styling.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|great game to play with friends. I never get sick of it. just really really wish they would get the new update. have it for my phone and it's awesome. please please please give us the updated version.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I love this app.  Especially the way it reads it t me as if Paul himself is speaking.  Easy to use Also with so many versions.
B007N0REX6|4.0|I debated between 3 and 4 stars, and ended up giving it 4 because I think Myles Kennedy and Slash are two great musicians. I think this is a good cd, but IMO not as good as the first. I think I had my hopes set way too high and I was slightly disappointed. Myles can sing the phone book and I would listen. The guy is brilliant. And Slash is amazing as well. I like the fact that Myles did all the vocals on this album vs. the many singers on the first cd. But, the songs overall on the first album just grabbed my attention better. It could be just me. You know, some albums just draw you in, and some don't. You can't really help it. After listening to the entire cd 3-4 times, I was just left with a feeling that the cd was rushed and/or written quickly just to get something out there. That was my impression and I can't really explain it any better than that. They are great however, and if you ever have a chance to see them live, don't pass it up! They will blow you away!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is ight... its not a bad game nor an awsome game but its enjoyable. this game could yous more games though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This (and the series) are awesome. The narrative speed is such it does not seem rushed yet keeps you glued to it til the very end. THEN you'll find yourself immediately purchasing the next in the series. Katniss will end up as much your hero as District 12's hero and mine. READ THIS BOOK, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! -Michelle Murray
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Remember that old saying, \\"You have to walk a mile in someone's shoes before you know him\\"?  The operative word is WALK.  Getting to know someone isn't a foot race.  It takes time.  In his beautifully written novel CANADA, Richard Ford doesn't rush.  I like that.  The main character Dell's life plays out in an barren landscape and his home is a tumbling down storage shack.  He works hard and is ignored by those who are supposed to look after him.  A tough slog indeed.  But Dell is persistent in doing what he is supposed to do and, in spite of his misfortunes, he believes that his lot will improve.  Just the kind of person I like being around.  For me, everything Dell says and thinks is exactly right for a boy his age in his time, place, and situation.  Ford's descriptions of Canada, as seen through Dell's eyes, are so rich that thinking back on them now they seem as vivid as my own memories of the out of the way places in Canada.  While reading this book, I found myself thinking about it as I went about the things that have to be taken care of day by day, just waiting until I could get back to reading it.  I enjoyed this book every step of the way.
B0031RG846|5.0|I collect the Schleich Elves, Unicorns, Horses, and mythical play sets. This unicorn foal is wonderfully detailed; with his vine and flowers rear leg detail, pink (with just a little glitter) tail, foot and mane hair and pretty blue eyes. The rest of his body is so white it almost glows. He is beautiful sculpted and very sturdy in construction. I'm never afraid to let anyone play with him even though he is part of my collection and I did not buy him as a toy.<br />I own very many of the Schleich in my collection but this Unicorn Foal is one of my favorite pieces for sure! I highly recommend it, as a collectable and as a toy. Any little girl would love this unicorn!<br />-Michelle Murray, 30 Years Old
B000PY52EU|4.0|This movie is on point, Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci make great chemistry together.<br />To save his soul, he must save hers from the mental issues that plague hers.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This is the type of game that I enjoy. You are the detective and the majority of games are a find the objects. The graphics are good and the game play is easy to understand.<br />My only complaint is that a mini game can't be saved in the middle of play. Enjoying playing it so far!
B000957O82|5.0|Great love movie! Hitch is a pro when it comes to bringing other people<br />together, but when it comes to himself, he's speechless when he finds the one<br />that catches his eye.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|The movie was really bad. Hal Jordan is not really in this movie. Only in name. This movie was Ryan Reynolds acting goofy for 2 hours until it was time to be serious and beat the bad guy. the villain was a bad choice too. not everybody is familiar with him so alot of people were asking who he was. overall, really bad. only sinestro is worth seeing.

B005F8CL1S|5.0|This is a fine collection of Leonard Cohens music. It spans his career and really brings his lifes trials into perspective. I would recommend this collection to anyone who either already enjoys Leonard or would like to know Leonard.

B004NJL03U|5.0|The most fantastic book I have ever read, you will honestly feel like a changed soul after you read this heart warming, mind opening, life changing memoir about one of the most amazing human begins that have lived. Morrie is right up there with Gandhi and Mother Teresa. Everyone should read this young and old.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed reading the series..however some parts got a little repetitive...as I am sure you can figure out what I am talking about.. But over all I really liked the books~!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As everything in the book is unbelievable, I choose to think I was reading just a woman's sexual fantasy. But the impossible characters, the terrible prose and the sex, which is at turns ridiculous or disgusting made me stop reading halfway through...<br />On the other hand, I think that publishing trash like this, at a time when women are still fighting to be taken seriously, is harmful. Stressing the innate masochism of women's minds and men's sadistic vein isn't a good idea.<br />What bothers me most is the fact that these books are called \\"romance\\". I find nothing romantic in this poorly written sado-masochistic story.
B007ZQHMPI|4.0|I have completed the entire series and would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a glimpse into this alternate lifestyle.  The text is written in very simple form, which makes it an easy read for everyone.  It is a perfect story line to just sit back and enjoy.  The details are specific enough that you can feel like you are in the moment with the characters.  If you are an avid reader who is looking for perfection in form, these books may be frustrating.  There is repetition and some gramatical errors.  Thankfully the adventures are enticing enough you can easily move past these things, as you are gripped with the curiousity of what may happen next.  Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! I'm glad it was on my Kindle so I could read it several times without worrying about how heavy the real book was. I'm also glad I got all 3 so I had the complete trilogy.
B003LJQQB4|4.0|I absolutely loved this book! I found it complex, descriptive, very well written & quite epic in the journey it takes the reader on. A fabulous twist at the end & a real page turner all of the way through. Kate Morton is an excellent writer & I have now bought 2 more of her books & can't wait to start them!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|The writing is poor and how can a college graduate not have a computer or e-mail address?  I certainly understand this is fiction but I think the writer is trying to get us to relate to these characters and in the beginning I could not at all.  By the end of the book I do like them both a little better and have more respect for Ana but it took almost the whole book. Reading the second, much better
0307730697|5.0|In honor of Independence Day, I decided to read Fearless by Eric Blehm.  I had the book sitting around waiting to be read for a week or so, and had a few hours of free time on the 4th, so decided to pick it up.<br /><br />Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down and finished it a few hours later, with a BBQ in the middle!<br /><br />To say that this is an amazing book and story would be a complete understatement.  Of course, I do love military action movies like GI Jane, which depicted the Navy SEAL \\"hell week\\", and turns out to be pretty accurate based on what I read in Fearless.<br /><br />But Fearless is much more than a military action book (which just so happens to be real), it is the story of Adam Brown, and his life.  From high school star, to his decline into drugs, and subsequent arrest, to his accepting Jesus as his savior in jail, and rise to become one of the top 1% of all SEALS in Navy SEAL team SIX.  Fearless is a journey, that Adam, a hero in his own right, decided to share with us as a final act of bravery.  To share all the story, including the bad parts, so that we could find the peace that he found in Christ as his personal Savior.<br /><br />From the beginning, Adam Brown was always fearless...jumping off bridges, climbing trees, and attacking everything he did with a level of intensity that never wavered.  Despite being smaller than others, he always was the first to volunteer, always the first to stick up for the underdog, never realizing that he was also the underdog.  His \\"can do\\" attitude, and respect for others earned him a reputation for being an outstanding young man.<br /><br />Then, as friends moved on in their lives, Adam found himself in the wrong crowd, which lead to years of drug abuse, stealing from friends and family, living in dumps, and finally arrest.  In this portion of the book, Adam (and his friends, per his final request), hold nothing back.  They don't sugar coat what happened, and as a result we are able toreally see Adam hitting rock bottom.<br /><br />But in jail, visited by a pastor, Adam turns his life around and accepts Jesus as his Savior.  From that moment on, Adam clawed his way out of the depths of trouble, and drugs, and finally finds direction with a drive to become a Navy SEAL.<br /><br />Along the way, he meets his future wife Kelley, who in her own right, was fearless as well, choosing to stay by Adam's side despite several drug relapses, and events that put her life in danger as well.<br /><br />As Adam begins what would become years of brutally hard training to become a Navy SEAL and then rise to the top 1% of all SEALS, Kelley is right alongside him, in her own \\"boot camp\\" of sorts - rising before dawn to make Adam breakfast and drive him to training, going to work, picking Adam up in the evening (sometimes very late), laundering his filthy clothes, making dinner, and drawing a bubble bath for Adam before they both collapsed in bed to begin again the next day.<br /><br />Throughout his years in the Navy, Adam Brown encounters more road blocks, setbacks and injuries that would sideline even the toughest of men, but yet he perseveres, and succeeds despite all odds.  He loses sight in his dominant eye due to a training accident so learns how to shoot and maneuver with his left eye.  Later, after having his fingers crushed in his dominant right hand, Adam learns to load and shoot his rifle with his left hand.  All this while putting himself through a grueling training that is hard for someone with two good eyes and hands to do, and he never gives up.<br /><br />We see the softer side of Adam too, as he collects shoes and socks for Afghan children, entertains a Sunday School class of toddlers, sticks up for a child that has Downs Syndrome, and as he plays with his own children.<br /><br />And all of this leads up to Adam Brown's final mission, in which he would give the ultimate sacrifice.  But he was not afraid to die, because he knew he would be in heaven, and he adamantly believed in the war that he was fighting and the freedom that he was fighting for.  Even though I knew the ending to the story, I still broke down and cried when I read of the bravery of Adam Brown, and the other SEALs, who did not give up hope, put their own lives on the line, and valiantly tried to save their brother.  I cried when Kelley's door bell rang in the middle of the night, and she opened the door to see her friends announcing the death of her husband.  I cried when Adam's children were told of their father's death.  I cried when I read of all the other soldiers and SEALs killed in action, many of whom had just talked to the author months before to ensure Adam's story would be told in explicit detail.  I cried when I thought of all the men and women who have given the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety and freedom that so many times we take for granted.<br /><br />Adam Brown was a husband, father, soldier, SEAL, patriot, hero, and he was Fearless.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Fearless to anyone.  It's one of the best books I have read!<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review. My opinions are my own.
0307592731|4.0|Cheryl Strayed's Wild was a fun read: highly entertaining and informative.  If you have ever wanted to do a long distance backpacking trip (in her case 1,100 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail through California and Oregon) this is a book you must read.  Her experiences make my past backpacking forays into wilderness areas look like day hikes!  Cheryl's story is, in many ways, a coming of age, as well as a coming to grips with life as it is.  Her months of hiking--mostly solo--transformed her in indescribable ways, but she does her best to share those inexplicable changes with her readers in an intimate and honest way.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a engaging mystery/espionage novel with clear good guys (feisty hackers) v bad guys (corporate lackeys) with the future of the (virtual) world as the prize.<br /><br />However, it is written for a very specific group of people: geeks and nerds from the 80s.<br /><br />If you give this to anyone born after about 1988 they won't get it. It is basically a nerdgasm novel for people that (mis)spent their youth in video arcades, playing on Atari 2600s/Commodore 64s and reading/watching cheesy cartoons/comics. That is, people just like me! If you have ever played the \\"Tomb of Horrors\\" or \\"Joust\\", know your Japanese robots and 80s music then you will get a kick out of this novel. A very enjoyable read.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|I heard some things about this movie, and thought it was going to be bad. I guess I heard wrong, I was hooked from the first scene. I kept waiting for things to go south, but they never did. I was very impressed by this film. It was probably one of the better films I'd seen all year. The reviews reflect my opinion on here, I suppose. This was better than most of the garbage I've seen this summer. I loved the realistic depiction of the SEALs. Don't hesitate to watch this film. Thank you!

B004XGN8W4|4.0|this product really serves its purpose by being a portable transport, protective casing, and a personal gaming monitor. and for the  price i got it for $209.99, compare to gamestop which is $40 higher, then i added ps3 mw3 bundle, i got and instant gaming system out-of-the-box. the product itself is very sturdy, well built, the sound is good but not that great (its understandable because of its size). specs says its 720p but when i played mw3 it shows at 1020p. its kinda heavy with the ps3 inside but thats not bad in a bad way i mean they probably used a strong, stable and sturdy materials which makes it heavy.
B00170MYIS|2.0|I purchased this Sony-branded battery to use as a spare for my Sony Cybershot camera.  The original battery that came with the camera works fine.  This one gets stuck in my camera.  It appears to be due to the label that is wrapped around the battery that does not stay sealed tight.  In the camera the battery functions fine, and it provides additional info about remaining battery life that the original battery does not provide.  But I returned it fearing it may one day get stuck in my camera for good.  I will say Amazon was very good about refunding my money even though the product was sold by someone else and only fulfilled by Amazon.
B000000OUE|5.0|Awesome cd! Astro Creep is basically the transition point, from Zombies time in White Zombie to his self named band, but one would only be able to figure it out by listening to Rob's self named band Rob Zombie. The sound of Astro Creep tells all basically, sine it is very similar to Hellbilly Deluxe.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I never write book reviews, but this series is so good I felt the need to shout praises from the rooftop!  Don't let the low price fool you - this is fantastic writing that will draw you in from page one.  Superb.
0091947561|5.0|Based on the business pedigree of the authors, I, like many other readers must have, had high expectations of this book. And it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />The majority of the points made and positions taken are stated so plainly, it feels as though they should already be conventionally held wisdom. But this really isn't the case. The book is rooted in the notions customer empathy, boundary pushing and learning how to learn. These beliefs are applicable well beyond \\"a world gone digital\\" and are laws for any type of business, marketing driven or not, online or offline, in our current cultural climate.<br /><br />The conversational style and mostly jargon free insights make this a remarkably refreshing and smart read.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all 3 books in a week. Each book was different yet kept with the whole storyline. I am now re-reading them because I loved them so much. Hoping that there will be another series told from Christian's point of view! Great read, be prepared to not want to put the book down!

B002FOQXZK|5.0|I was coming out of Wawa one day when this kid was in the parking lot selling homemade mix cd's. Now I'm 34 years old and I don't care much for the majority of the rappers out now. I'm into Biggie, Slick Rick, Kool G Rap, Nas, Jay-Z, Common, Kanye West, Mobb Deep, Wu-Tang Clan, Gangstarr, Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, you get the picture. He was trying to get me to buy Kid Cudi's mixtape. I was like hell no, I don't listen to nobody under 30 cause the're probably saying some immature lyrics about girls, money and some other simple minded mess like the majority of these mainstream rappers that are played on the radio today. So the kid says just listen to his mixtape. At the time I didn't know much about Kid Cudi aside from his appearances on Kanye West's albums. Even then I really didn't pay much attention to him because I was listening to Kanye. So the kid says take it for free. So I'm thinking what the hell, let me see what this kid sounds like and I popped it in my car stereo. I was blown away. The beats were slamming and Kid Cudi's flow blended perfectly with them. Then I went online and ordered his official mixtape, Space Odyssey. Loved it. Now I have this album on cd and permanently in my Ipod. He's been said to have simple lyrics but that's really not true. He's just in touch with his emotions and he's not afraid to express them. He doesn't sound like a gimmick or an industry made rapper. He sounds like a true artist. Plus he uses a lot of metaphors when he raps like De La Soul does. For that reason and the sound of his beats a lot of people aren't going to listen to him or even understand him. That sets him apart from all the other rappers out here now including some of the ones I named earlier that I listen to. His beats have an alternative sound to them that you really don't hear in hip hop. His music sounds like what hip hop is evolving to and will sound like in the future once all these garbage rappers are out of the picture and this era of shallow, fake rappers is over. No doubt this kid has talent. Unfortunately, he's so far ahead of his time that he's not gonna be appreciated by the majority of the hip hop community today. To get into Kid Cudi and his beats you have to be the type of person that thinks outside of the box and appreciates other forms of music. Like I said his beats have an alternative sound to them so that's gonna put off a lot of people who listen to rappers like Lil Wayne, Young Jeezy and most of the other rappers out now. If that's you then Kid Cudi is definitely not for you. You might as well stop reading my review right now. On the other hand if you're like me and can appreciate all music and an artist who's different from the norm and who's not afraid to be himself then you definitely need to check out this album. I don't have his second album yet but I will be getting it and anything else Scott Mescudi releases. It's also refreshing to know that there are young artists out there who aren't afraid to be real artists and not just ride the wave of the current trends. Kid Cudi doesn't even look like your average rapper. He doesn't wear braids, platinum and diamonds. He just wears his hat and glasses and does his thing. Which I really respect. He's very introspective and innovative as well plus I can tell he's a deep thinker like me. He says more in one verse than Lil Wayne or these other rappers say on their whole album. Personally, I love his lyrics and beats. The Soundtrack 2 My Life is my jam. I'm glad he kicked his coke habit and I look forward to more of his music in the future. If this is what hip hop is evolving into then maybe there's some hope for it. There needs to be a huge wave of rappers like Kid Cudi who come in and just flood the industry with real and creative music. Then our less evolved counterparts would have no choice but to listen to real music or listen to nothing at all. If more rappers like Kid Cudi come out then hip hop is gonna do one of two things. It's gonna merge together and evolve into artists similar to Kid Cudi. Or it's gonna split altogether and the more evolved hip hop fans are gonna go the way of Kid Cudi and Kanye West and the less evolved hip hop fans are gonna go the way of Lil Wayne. Either way I think hip hop will return to what it's supposed to be and not just an assembly line manufactured product to sell. We need more rappers like this in the industry. Kid Cudi is a great artist but he can't turn the tide by himself. Not with the odds he's up against. If more and more kids like him with their own individual sound and intellectual lyrics come out then hip hop will have no choice but to change. To me Scott Mescudi is an example of what hip hop in the future should sound like. Only time will tell if it changes for the better. Peace, and support real hip hop.    Brian from VA
B00846TTDG|5.0|...and made me feel like I should be the best man I can.  My grandfather served, and he was the best man I ever knew.  This movie helps to make that connection for those of us who have never seen active duty and what it must be like.  Although, you could never really know how it is unless you've been there.<br /><br />For all these people running around on their high horses talking all kinds of things about this country, this movie sends a clear message:  you have that right because brave men and women serve this country to earn it for you.<br /><br />We owe them a debt of gratitude for serving our nation, and sacrificing all they have.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Finally.... the Beach Boys are back! With the return of musical genius Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys are back together at last!  And a new CD from the Beach Boys with Brian Wilson at the helm is like somehow getting a new Beatles CD with all new material! What a joy to listen once again to those beautiful Beach Boys harmonies on all new songs!<br /><br />\\"Thats why God Made the Radio\\" is the title track and initial single, but in my opinion not one of the top three tracks.  To me, a life long Beach Boys fan, \\"Isn't it Time\\" takes the honor of best track on the new album.  This upbeat uplifting tune features all three original Beach Boys in various  solo parts.  Mike Love, Al Jardine and, of course, the great Brian Wilson take their turns on this awesome tune that serves up classic Beach Boy harmonies and catch melodies that Beach Boys fans have loved for decades.  \\"Spring Vacation\\" is clearly based on the Beach Boys getting back together and refers to them \\"still having a blast\\".  \\"Shelter\\" is another outstanding Beach Boys tune that mixes great harmonies and falseto's to create a song that stands up right next to the long list of Beach Boys classics.<br /><br />If you are a Beach Boys fan, you will LOVE this CD and spend the summer with it in your CD player as you cruise down the street soaking in the sunshine and the magic of Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys!
B00828HQFO|4.0|when i saw the trailer, i knew i wanted to watch this movie. not a big fan of jean-claude, but this one caught my interest. kept my interest most of the time except for the story line. Enjoyed the martial arts. would reccommend this to friends to see.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|Initial Thoughts:<br />This book was on the best sellers list as soon as it came out, so I was intrigued to what made it so special. After reading the blurb, I was so curious about this Victorian language of flowers and how it would play a part in the book.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />This book shows you just what happens to kids after they \\"age out\\" of the foster care situation. Also, it shows you how difficult it can be to both a foster child and a foster parent.<br /><br />The Victorian language of flowers is beautiful and so interesting. The book even comes with a flower \\"dictionary\\" in the back.<br /><br />Victoria's story, while heartbreaking, is empowering and inspirational.<br /><br />Interconnected details that originally present themselves as mundane really build the story into something strong and meaningful.<br /><br />The many plot twists kept me guessing.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />I wasn't a big fan of the ending.<br /><br />Victoria comes across incredibly selfish in many parts of the book, and at times it turned me off to the book.<br /><br />The Wrap Up:<br />A fantastic read. The story has so much heart and the flashbacks really help you discover why the characters are the way they are. Also, you'll know what your favorite flower says about you by the end of the book.<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br /><br />\\"It wasn't as if the flowers themselves held within them the ability to bring an abstract definition into physical reality. Instead, it seemed that...expecting change, and the very belief in the possibility instigated a transformation.\\"
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book sucked me right into its world and hasn't let go! I enjoyed the characters, the story line and the plot twists. I've read all 5 books, am waiting for the last and just started the prequel series, the Infernal Devices.
B00846REIS|5.0|This novel was the potential 50 Shades of Grey had, but didn't reach at all. People harping on this being a cop off of 50 Shades may be right in a way but this story line isn't something new, it's been used over and over again -- those other books just haven't made it main stream like 50 Shades-- which is fan fiction at best and will never be anything more. You can see Twilight all through the book and it started to become obnoxious.<br /><br />Bared To You is the version of this torrid tale of the rich young man getting with the younger woman with some controlling/dominating characters thrown in. It's well written and keeps you enthralled. I actually liked the characters and didn't think they were extremely far fetched. It's fiction but its the kind you hope would happen in real life. I am excited for the next installment of this series-- the secrets are engaging and each chapter keeps you salivating for more.<br /><br />My opinion-- don't waste your money on 50 Shades and go for Bared To You. The female character is actually tolerable and not some bumbling child who says \\"crap!\\", \\"double crap!\\" all the time. I'm happy a seasoned writer was able to turn this idea into something readable and entertaining.
B001CZ6CL8|5.0|Had this album and have worn it out in the 40 years at least 3 times.I play guitar so I used it for practice. This album is the best live album avalable! Unbelievable guitar work! You can not go wrong.
076115678X|5.0|I bought another book for curly/natural women months ago and still have not finished that book.  I got this book after a friend of mine told me she couldn't put it down and even bought the mp3 version because she wanted to have it near by and couldn't wait to read it again. I read this book in 2 days...could have been 1 day but got the book after work and couldn't put it down.  I love the different stories from other naturals/curly girls it was inspiring.  Mostly every curly girl/natural can tell you...it's a hard journey and this books gives such great tips.  I never thought I could go without a comb or brush.  I haven't picked one up after reading this book.  Love the book and I tell everyone I can so that they can get the same encouragement and great tips! The only bad thing about this book was that it was too short!

1612183956|4.0|...because it grabs you by the collar in Chapter 1 and takes off running, and it doesn't turn you loose until the final page. Pines is what you would get if you crossed an episode of Lost with a Stephen King novel, then mated the offspring with an episode of the Twilight Zone.<br /><br />The main character, Ethan Burke, a Secret Service Agent, wakes up next to a river running through a mountain meadow. He has no wallet, no cell phone, and no memory of how he got there. The reader follows him along as he tries to figure out what is going on. And that, skimpy as it is, is all I'm going to say about the actual events and characters of the book because, in my opinion, it would ruin the book for you. I believe you need to be in the dark, just as Agent Burke is, to fully appreciate the story.<br /><br />This book is almost a great book. In fact, right up until the final chapter, it is a great book. However, I had a few issues with the final chapter - a gaping plot hole here, something that made no sense there, sprinklings of sensationalistic apocalyptic environmentalism everywhere. If not for those, I would have given the book 5 stars.<br /><br />I did like this book. It was one heck of a wild ride. I think it will appeal to a fairly wide audience. Amazon categorized it as a mystery/thriller, but it wouldn't be much of a stretch to label it sci-fi, as well. If you read the book description and you think it sounds kind of interesting, go ahead and pick up a copy. I think you'll like it.

B003TJR2HS|3.0|I purchased this item because I had bought an Otterbox for my iPhone 4 and needed an extender so I could dock my phone in my iHome and still wake up to music when the alarm went off.  I received this item about 2 weeks ago.  It worked great, but just yesterday (July 4th 2012) when I plugged my phone in, I received a message that this device was not supported by Apple.  Not only did the alarm not play music when it went off, but I could no longer play the iPod on my phone through the iHome and my keyboard sounds went away completely.  I had to restart my phone to get them to work again, and when I plugged the device using the adapter back into the iHome, I would receive the same message.<br /><br />As I am writing this, I was messing around with the phone.  I had shut it down again and plugged it into the iHome using the CableJive adapter while the phone was off.  The phone restarted and now the device seems to be working.  This may be a work around for anyone else experiencing an incompatibility problem with Apple.<br /><br />I don't think this is CableJive's fault.  I think Apple's software recognized that the device is not an Apple product and is now rejecting it.  I gave this item 3 stars only because it seems to be working again.  I will follow up at a later date on any further problems with this adapter.

B007U2ABXM|5.0|I've listened to and been captivated by Patti Smith since the late 70s, catching up quickly after Horses, and moving through Radio Ethiopia, Easter, Wave, and the Great Hiatus, until now.  This album is absolutely the pinnacle of achievement.  The deluxe package with book, photos, and lyrics is well done, and reflect the total coherence of this work.  As I listen now to \\"Fuji San,\\" its an anthem in Patti-style with the strong voice, calling the soliders to war.  Then, there are the beautiful, melodic songs like \\"This is the Girl,\\" and \\"April Fool,\\" and the best of them, \\"Maria.\\"  I could just cry when she sings about the \\"white shirt, black tie,\\" memory she invokes here.  And wow, Sun Ra, Johnny Depp, and Neil Young??  What really has me in love with this work, is exactly what I live for in my own life, travelling with the knowledge and history of the explorers, that are invoked in \\"Amerigo,\\" and \\"Constantine\\"s Dream.\\"  There is a bit of Frances Mayes here, whose love of Italy and its art weaves through her novels.  Patti Smith manages to call upon all the beauty of Italy and its patron saints.  I am sailing with \\"Amerigo,\\" and Columbus, and Piero della Francesca, as well as Saint Francis.  Patti Smith has done what the great artists do --- leave us stunned with the beauty of a clear voice; a tapestry of art from the cover to the last song, \\"Just Kids.\\"  And, yes, the artist can make us laugh, and howl along with \\"Banga.\\"  What a great journey.  The last decade that brought us \\"Gung Ho,\\" and \\"Trampin',\\" -- wonderful as they were, seem to fade in comparison to \\"Banga.\\"  I just can't stop playing this.<br />\\"I knew you, when we were young......\\"
044024630X|4.0|This book entertains in a big way, mostly because of the author's literary talent. The plot is not very believable, the main character is a bit one dimensional, the cliff-hangers are too many, but I didn't mind any of these because I just enjoyed the style and the writing so much. Lee Child is a very good writer. In his hands, the mediocre plot turns into truly suspenseful story that I couldn't put down. So for the entertainment value I'd give it 5 stars.<br />I only have an issue with the woman's character here, but it's a grave one. The woman is the sheriff and an ex-military cop. But the way she is portrayed, she could be a nanny. She knows nothing about being a sheriff and a cop. She has several homicides in town but she does nothing. She is an ex-cop but she is not capable to think up anything or to check up anything. To the point that she does not see that in a house with a backyard and a broken fence people might leave the house through the backyard and not the front door! How did the woman leave the house unseen? On my! The only thing she can do is hold on tight to Reacher and immediately include him in the investigation - basically he does the investigating while she patrols and drives him around. She is useless!<br />This was the second Reacher book I read--the first one was the book about the vice president. And this is the second book where Child places women high up (sheriff here, vice-president security there), and his only purpose in doing so is that Reacher looks cool when they request his help and when he conquers them. I have no problem with him conquering them. But these women are totally incompetent at their jobs. The only good thing they can do it to ask Reacher help them. This is not a good portrayal of women, and I guess this shows us what the author really thinks of women. So this is why I said I did not like him and why my final score is 4 stars.

B004QNN1UI|5.0|This Simply Red concert is very well done.  I hate the fact that there will be no more concerts.  He put a different spin on some of his classic tunes and they sounded wonderful.

I already pay for HBO so I really don't see the need to buy anymore of Mr. Martin's blatherings about fingers & chins dripping bacon grease or how deep an impession Sam's foot makes in the snow. I mean REALLY?! An entire chapter of Sam walking and talking to himself?!!! Or was that book 3? The mind reels from monotonous droll.

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I was part of a packed, vocal, enthusiastic screening audience who appreciated every minute of this marvelous snapshot of the segregated 60s in Jackson, Mississippi, when Jim Crow laws were still in effect.<br /><br />The stories, based on Kathryn Stockett's phenomenally successful (and beloved) novel, are female-centric, as they focus on the relationships among the women, black and white, employee and employer, complete with abuse of power, sincere affection, bitchiness, and well-founded fear. The men in the audience were equally vocal because men in this story are not demonized: Racism and ignorance are the villains here.<br /><br />The casting is to die for:<br />  * Viola Davis (\\"It's Kind of a Funny Story\\") is Aibileen, the heart, brains and soul of this wonderful story.<br />  * Emma Stone (\\"Crazy, Stupid, Love\\") is Skeeter, the well-meaning young wannabe writer. She is told by her New York publisher to hurry with her book about black domestics working for prominent white families, before \\"this whole civil-rights thing blows over.\\"<br />  * Octavia Spencer (\\"Dinner For Schmucks\\") is Minny, who has most of the funny lines. I know the word \\"sassy\\" is overworked, but this sister is sassy! And in case you read the book, YES, she does bake that pie! (Spencer won an Oscar for this role.)<br />  * Bryce Dallas Howard (\\"Hereafter\\") is Hilly, the witch we love to hate. Her comeuppance can't come any too soon and is greeted with cheers from the audience.<br />  * Jessica Chastain (\\"Jolene\\") is Celia, the lost soul taken under the warm wing of her maid where she learns some necessary survival skills.<br />  * Allison Janney (\\"Life During Wartime\\") is Charlotte, our writer's mother, who has her own heart-breaking story.<br />  * Sissy Spacek (\\"Get Low\\") is Missus Walters, she just wants Ambrosia salad, a bit of sherry and her \\"soaps.\\" Her glee when her nasty daughter hits a rough patch is infectious.<br />  * Cicely Tyson (\\"Why Did I Get Married Too?\\") is Constantine, the elderly domestic who is wrongfully fired.<br />  * David Oyelowo (\\"The Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\") is Preacher Green, the local neighborhood preacher. This adroit actor was born in the U.K.<br /><br />I'm frustrated because time and space do not permit me to include all the deserving names.

1847879071|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I first started reading Andy Field's book on SPSS but I quickly realized that his humor and zany statistical examples were excellent examples that worked with what we were learning. It's not dry at all but it is an introductory text, specifically for SPSS. I read some reviews of people complaining about it not getting to the point or being in depth enough so if you are looking for a graduate level statistical book this probably isn't it. SPSS is easy and this book helps you understand how to do what you need to do to understand your data.<br /><br />It should also be noted that Andy Field is a psychologist so a lot of the material is appealing to psychology students. It does very little to introduce the mathematical background of the equations and if you are looking for something along those lines you should probably check out some of the R books.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|What a pleasure to review a film when I don't have to reach for good things to say. This heartwarming R-rated comedy is based on a book which tells the true story of two wildly different men who find a common ground and build an enduring friendship based on mutual respect. It was clear from the very beginning that the audience was invested in the story and I loved hearing gales of laughter throughout the theater from beginning to end. Audiences at the 2012 Seattle International Film Festival voted this the \\"Most Liked\\" selection.<br /><br />In this award-winning film from France (English captions), a wealthy aristocrat is paralyzed from a para-gliding accident and has hired many health-care worker/nurses who find caring for a wealthy quadriplegic too intimidating. A chronically unemployed immigrant from Senegal goes for an interview simply to get his application signed so he can continue his public assistance. He tends to be a little rude and doesn't show much respect or pity for the patient, who finds his lack of pity refreshing. The rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />We enjoy:<br />  * François Cluzet (\\"Tell No One\\") is the aristocrat. His new nurse/attendant is like a splash of cold water right smack in the face (which is the only part of his body with any sensation)!<br />  * Omar Sy (\\"Micmacs\\") is the irrepressible nurse who starts out by stealing a Fabergé egg, so he isn't exactly a saint. His incredulity at his first opera is infectious and we all laughed along with our two heroes. And you've gotta see this guy dance!<br />  * Anne Le Ny (\\"Declaration of War\\") is charming as the woman who runs the house, the staff, and knows everything. Her slow but steady thaw is so gratifying.<br />  * Audrey Fleurot (\\"Midnight in Paris\\") has two of the funniest scenes with the nurse, and you don't expect it either time.<br /><br />As a wrap-up, they include a couple of clips of the real fellows who were depicted in this film. That is very nice. Once again I have proven I am not an artiste. This satisfying little film has no aspirations to Art (capital \\"A\\"), but instead to Entertainment, which is where my discretionary spending money goes. Yes, I will BUY this one from Amazon.
B007H9B8FS|3.0|I was soooo excited to see Garbage making a come back since they were my all time favorite band when I was in high school, but it's definitely not their best work. Its pretty similar to their last album \\"Bleed Like Me\\" which came out in 2005. Doesn't compare to their first 3 albums, but you should check it out if you're a fan if for nothing else than the nostaglia. The sound is much more up beat like the Ting Tings/Yeah Yeah Yeahs verses the orignal slow, dark Garbage beats that I'm used to (and love).
B005LAIHZY|5.0|\\"It's not my fault!\\" We hear this familiar cry many times during the course of this exciting PG-rated film. A doughty red-haired girl and her faithful horse are up against an old curse that has turned one Scottish clan against another. Not only that, our willful and stubborn princess is in full revolt against her mother's attempts to turn her into a lady. She would much rather be in the forest with her bow and arrows, or climbing rocks to test her courage.<br /><br />The combination of Pixar and Disney gives us wonderful emotion, with the mother's subtle expressions that ring true, plus stunningly realistic animals: the horse in particular is amazing, although the bear is good, too. (I didn't like the dogs.)<br /><br />Voiced by:<br />  * Kelly Macdonald (\\"Boardwalk Empire\\") is Merida, our tomboy princess, who has long curly red hair and blue eyes, the perfect Scots lass. Ms Macdonald was born in Scotland, but as an actress, she plays any nationality (\\"No Country For Old Men\\"); here we are treated to an authentic Scots' brogue.<br />  * Emma Thompson (\\"Men in Black III\\") is exquisite as a frustrated Queen Elinor, struggling with her rebellious daughter who does NOT want to be a lady!<br />  * Billy Connolly (\\"Gulliver's Travels\\") is King Fergus, rambunctious, brawling, and with one peg leg, due to an historic bout with a bear many years ago.<br />  * Julie Walters (\\"Momma Mia!\\") cackles her way around our heroine as The Witch, full of more trickery than teeth.<br /><br />Animation gets better and better, plus the sound was outstanding. The horse's hoof-beats were clearly those of a massive Clydesdale rather than a regular-size riding horse. Don't ask me how I know....<br /><br />Expect lots of brawling, chaotic chase scenes and a truly violent fight between two bears. Bloodless, but with lots of roaring, claws and teeth. Not a child in our packed screening audience moved a muscle, so I'll be sure to tell my JayFlix.net folks when Amazon has this available on DVD.<br/><br />Surprisingly, even though this is Disney, there was no Prince Charming, our little heroine is pretty self sufficient; and then, because this is Disney, our heroine finally owns up to her mistakes and admits it when something IS her fault! Whew!<br /><br />Oh! And be careful what you wish for!
B0085776BG|5.0|Red Tails, was an excellent follow-up to Tuskegee Airman! It shows what it took to get these African American pilot's of World War 2 had to endure in order to get better aircraft (P-51 Mustang's) and better missions, and they got that, and they did more than just fly missions, the protected the heavy bombers of B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberator's on their bomber missions over the most dangerous real estate at the time, Germany!  The Red Tails became very famous for they stayed with the bombers and did not go off to seek their own glory, yet what they did, did earn them glory from the many bombers and crew that kept alive during their time in the air.  I only wished they had the original cast in the movie, such as Larry Fishburne.  If you are looking for factual WW 2 drama at it's best, then Red Tails is something you will want.

0425220931|5.0|The title of this book says what it's all about - a spiritual search for growth.  In that context, I loved this book, and will recommended to anyone seeking a spiritual path through their music practice.  This isn't a book that's going to teach you anything, or give you technical tips on how to be a better musician.  This book is all about using music to expand your beingness - who you are as a complete human being.<br /><br />Wooten admits that what he describes in this book may have never happened - it may be just something he dreamed.  In fact, the whole thing may be a work of fiction. That said, the meaning of the messages in this book are valuable enough to me that I'm sure I'll refer back to it often.<br /><br />I did the audio-book version first, but I'll get an ebook version as well as a reference.  The audio-book is more like a performance than a recitation, and includes a great soundtrack provided by Wooten himself.
0938045768|5.0|The books Convict Conditioning 1 and 2, by Paul \\"Coach\\" Wade, argue that the human body is its own gym, and even lay out training progressions, detailed explanations and diagrams of the exercises, and information on \\"old school\\" calisthenics / body weight conditioning for insane strength. I have been working through the progressions personally, and teaching from the books to students in my boxing, MMA, and karate classes. I can say that the progressions are the real deal. The body was built to run, jump, climb, push, and pull - all of these being survival skills. Convict Conditioning teaches these in its training progressions. Essentially, body weight conditioning is the way to go for optimal athletic performance. From easy wall pushups to one armed pushups, remedial pull ups, basic ab work to hanging leg raises, and many other types of exercises. All in all, I would argue that a lot of these exercises are similar to what is taught in many martial arts and karate classes, especially the pushups, squats, and leg raises.<br /><br />The author also argues against what he calls the modern fitness scam. We're put on a variety of weight machines that isolate muscles, or work out on a bench and told to work out to pressing or curling genuinely heavy amounts of weight, or lifting very light free weights for lots of reps. Sure, we do see some results, and there's no doubting the serious strength exhibited by the world's best bench pressers. Although, on the other hand, the body was not meant to handle those kinds of loads - the joints and tendons don't naturally cope with them. Also, machines, heavy benching, and light free weights do very little for overall health or overall functional strength, especially compared to body weight conditioning.<br /><br />Prison inmates won't always have access to any kind of equipment. Hence, the name Convict Conditioning - the author's training progressions lay out a lot of things that prisoners practice when in lockdown. The argument is not that the prison lifestyle is something to be sought after, but that the human body is its own gym. All you need, at most, are a wall, something to hang from, a chair, a tennis ball, and a medicine ball or basketball.<br /><br />Convict Conditioning also contains history about exercise and old school strongmen, as well as details on warming up, supplementary exercises, workout routines from beginner to very advanced, and more. The second book goes beyond the basics, and includes such things as training progressions for the neck, forearms, and calves, and how to train your joints.<br /><br />The full body, functional strength training that Paul Wade lays out is very beneficial to athletic performance in general, and certainly for martial arts. I especially recommend his books to everyone enrolled in self defense, Kungfu, Taekwondo, and Karate classes, or similar styles.ot that the prison lifestyle is something to be sought after, but that the human body is its own gym.

B007N5YJWK|5.0|We are a culture that often doesn't value the past which is tragic because there's a treasure trove of great films and literature that wasn't made or written last week. Hitchcock's classic 1935 thriller \\"The 39 Steps\\" still remains the definitive film of John Buchan's novel (although it might not always be the most faithful)but, more importantly, it introduces the themes that occupied Hitchcock throughout most of the rest of his film career--an innocent man wrongly accused, the use of a MacGuffin (something important to the characters that pushes the plot forward but truly doesn't matter to us)among other elements that Hitchcock returned to throughout his career. \\"The 39 Steps\\" provides a template for many other Hitchcock's later thrillers. Unlike a lot of thrillers from the same time frame, \\"The 39 Steps\\" holds up remarkably well.<br /><br />A breezy thriller \\"The 39 Steps\\" focuses on Robert Hannay (Robert Donat)who finds himself wrongly accused of the murder of a woman who has information on a group of spies in England. Hannay goes on the run and finds himself handcuffed to Pamela (Madeleine Carroll)as he tries to elude a murderous spy missing the tip of his finger.<br /><br />Pay attention to the sequence where Hitchcock creates a bold sequence which follows stars Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll as they are being \\"escorted\\" to the bad guy as it pulls back from a studio shot IN the car and moves around to the back of the car as it's driven down a country road shot on location all without an apparent edit (for 1935 it's a truly daring and revolutionary shot and quite breathtaking especially in an early film like this. He would use the same technique for a long tracking shot in \\"Frenzy\\" 37 years later).<br /><br />The Criterion Edition of the film appears to use the same print (and the film is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 and in black and white)as for the previous DVD and they've done a very nice job of restoring and cleaning up the film for Blu-ray (although there are the odd scratches, minor speckles and, in one scene, a fairly thick hair in the corner of the screen which, I'm surprised, wasn't cleaned up further for this edition).The contrast looks quite nice in this transfer with nice grain structure and a largely clean and sharp looking image. For a film that's 77 years old, \\"The 39 Steps\\" looks quite nice.<br /><br />Audio sounds clear and reflects the sound quality typical of an early talkie but by, selectively using noise reduction and other techniques, most of the hiss has been removed without compromising the mono soundtrack.<br /><br />As with most Criterion Editions this one comes with a lot of very nice extras. First and foremost we get an informative commentary from Hitchcock scholar Marian Keane as well as the half hour 2000 documentary on Hitchcock's early British films \\"Hitchcock: The Early Years\\" which is new to this edition. We also 40 minutes of footage from Mike Scott's 1966 interview with Hitchcock and, just as illuminating and important, we get excerpts from Truffaut's 1962 audio interview with Hitchcock. We also get surviving original production design drawings the 1937 Lux Radio Broadcast featuring Ida Lupino and Robert Montgomery.<br /><br />New to this edition is a \\"visual essay\\" from  Hitchcock scholar Leonard Leff ([[ASIN:0520217810 Hitchcock and Selznick: The Rich and Strange Collaboration of Alfred Hitchcock and David O.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could barely put this down. Not only is the story itself interesting, the characters are very well developed. It's a rare event to read a self-published author that can actually tell a story well, much less very well. Even more rare is one that can also spell, construct a sentence, and maintain a consistent story flow. I'm now buying everything I can find written by Mr. Howey, and I don't expect to be disappointed by any of it.<br /><br />Ok,just to be fair, I suppose if I have any criticism at all, he does get a few technical details wrong, but nothing that interferes with the story line. These aren't anything that would be noticed by anyone other than an engineer, so don't let this in any way stop you from reading this.<br /><br />Finally, Mr. Howey, write faster! I can't wait to see how the Silo series will evolve. You've got us all hooked, and I'm going to run out of your other stories way too soon.

Even though It's mostly plastic like, It seems like It will last a long time without breaking. I think It's neat how you can use the flap to make as a stand for watching movies, or any thing you want to do hands free. I do It for books, movies, music,and some games. I also like that you can fold the flap to keep It out of the way of the screen while using the Fire. I also like that It has the black strap which I sometimes use for carrying and putting my Pointer thing In.
0316044695|3.0|Found myself skipping pages trying to get to the story.  Early SEAL training stuff was OK, folksy Texas boy stories along with family and friends waiting stories at the farm for news when Luttrell turns up MIA -- skipped that too.  Luttrell has bragging rights.  He get's a PASS.  Even if the writing is verbose.<br /><br />Hammering home the message that he is 1) a SEAL, 2) a patriotic SEAL, 3) from Texas, got boring after a few times.  Texas is not that special a State, but Luttrell or Robinson, the co-writer, would have readers believe this over and over again.<br /><br />Blaming ''libruls'' for the inability of the US to fight a war compromised by the Geneva Convention is political hubris.  Fluff.  Gotta blame someone.  Put the blame where it belongs.  With the government and both political parties.<br /><br />Throw the Rules of Engagement out the window.  Let our soldiers fight to win.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|I was super excited to get the XBox w/Kinect ... until it arrived. I was disappointed that MS doesn't tell you the kinect only works in large rooms. Being as I live in an apartment in NYC, we couldn't use it.  I heard about the Zoom for Kinect after searching info online on how to get the kinect to work in a small area and ordered it.<br /><br />If you follow the instructions, it's easy to put on the kinect.  After about 20 minutes of trial and error (putting the kinect higher up then lower), it worked! I have only about 6 feet from the TV console to the couch and actually only stand about 4 feet from the TV since you need space behind you in order to move about. With the Zoom for Kinect I was finally able to calibrate the Kinect and start using it.  For me, it works best about 4 feet from the ground, at the very edge of the TV console. You have to experiment with it until you find where it can \\"see\\" you best.<br /><br />Definitely worth the money if you aren't able to use your kinect because of space restrictions.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I put off seeing this movie until just recently...I enjoy the BBC versions too much. How can a 2 hour movie possibly capture the wonder of this book? Well, it can and it can't. I enjoyed it as simply another adaption of this Jane Austen classic. It wasn't better than the BBC versions, but on its own merit, it was good. Keira Knightley makes a GREAT Elizabeth Bennett, and Darcy is a bit more sympathetic and soft than the other Darcys. I was also turned off by the \\"sexy\\" reviews, but I wouldn't have used those words. There was chemistry...that's how I'd describe it. I didn't understand the scene with the statues and their nudity...what was the point? And there were other liberties taken. But if you want a quick P & P fix, it was pretty good.

B005723JSQ|1.0|I don't even think I can finish this awful excuse for a book!  Sophie Kinsella rambles on and on in this book.  The worst part is by far the footnotes!  After EVERY chapter there are footnotes after footnotes after footnotes!  Do not waste your time or money on this AWFUL book!
B000JML7YC|4.0|This is a parody of the Gothic literature, that was so popular at the time this book was written. One almost wonders how it ever got published. Given the style it was constructed in, being humorous, this book is very odd. Some parts I couldn't really understand, but other than that, fun story with no vampires - YAY!!! I always found the altering of classic literature to be rather horrid.

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Prometheus has mixed reviews and I can see why. Its part genius and big let down. I mean it starts off amazing but the last 20 minutes felt like an episode from Buffy the Vampire slayer. Its like the producers inserted the big explosions at the end and edited out the better parts, like the scene with Guy Pierce giving a Ted talk (you can see it on Youtube, its better than the film). There were other clever scenes planned for Prometheus that didn't make it into the final cut.<br /><br />I don't know why it's being marketed as a prequel to the Alien movies, this has nothing to do with Alien and Aliens, it isn't a prequel, it is sh't! Al<br /><br />I reckon that the produces chickened out and dumbed it down for some reason...<br />Its like they showed another version to a group of people who didn't get it and so they cut all the cool stuff out and patched it up with rubbish.<br /><br />I listened to Terry Gilliam once on the radio saying that Hollywood is reluctant to release a film unless it's first been viewed by a focus group. This way the film can better suit the tastes of the public, or to be more precise, the tastes of the small sample picked for the focus group, and because this tiny sample of humanity represents the rest of us, the film will be just great. So this boils down to about 40 people, picked at random from the public, like they do in jury service, choosing what goes into the final cut. It doesn't matter if the writer of the film is a genius, like Terry Gilliam, because these days, a jury of 'yahoos' choose how the film develops\\"! I borrowed the 'yahoo' bit from Bill Hicks who complained about the same phenomenon.<br /><br />This 'sample of the public' that Terry Gilliam and Bill Hicks are talking about, or to use less Orwell-spach jargon, the whims of the average person, is reflected on the final cut of the film and this is why many films we see these days always end happily, even when the plot was obviously leading to a tragic finale, or the narrative sometimes seams 'chopped' and dumbed down in places and so confuses and abuses the intelligence of the paying viewer.<br /><br />Welcome Prometheus, the biggest pile of horse dung the yahoos can muster!<br /><br />\\"If an ass peers into a book, do not expect a saint to peer out.\\" (Augustine)e sometimes seams 'chopped' and dumbed down in places and so confuses and abuses the intelligence of the paying viewer.<br /><br />Welcome Prometheus, the biggest pile of horse dung the yahoos can muster!<br /><br />\\"If an ass peers into a book, do not expect a saint to peer out.\\" (Augustine)

030758836X|5.0|This story grabs the reader from the very first page, the opening paragraph and just doesn't let go.  It's the story of Amy and Nick Dunne-- they're a couple that has baggage just like everyone else, but that's the way life is.  As the reader, I was quickly  sucked into the vortex of this marriage that's in a very dark place, it's a marriage in  peril.  Amy disappears on their fifth wedding anniversary just as the traditional plans for celebrating their anniversary come to fruition and thus begins this chilling mind-blowing tale.  I barely looked up from this novel; it begs to be read in large chunks.  Just as I thought I had everything figured out, the plot went in a totally different direction and I was completely confounded.  All the characters are well drawn and completely believable.  At times I was sickened by what was happening, but I quickly became addicted and had to keep reading.<br /><br />This is the perfect suspenseful, thrilling summer read!  I look forward to reading the other offerings from this author.

B008CRC506|2.0|At this shows VERY BEST it`s a 4 stars and at it`s least? 2 stars and that`s being Generous. Now.. if i was from NYC amd REALLY REALLY loved it then i MIGHT give it 3 1/2-4 stars but i am not from NYC. I did have to live there for 2 yrs but that hardly makes me a New Yorker, sorry :)<br /><br /> Decent Characters and Decent writing gives the show 3 stars! I had it at 2 stars but at the last mnute raised it to 3. It`s certainly not horrible and I have gotten through Most of the shows uninterupted but i would not go out of my way or miss anything to make sure i watched this.<br /><br />NOW, mst of the Can`t miss shows are the first few seasons of Nurse Jackie but Mainly........ SHAMELESS! Now thats a show that is almost a crime to miss. I have NEVER EVER seen a show or movie that had so many great Characters, Young or Old (I am 53 Years OLD) and the writing, the City and Photography is unbelievavable!!! It would be a \\"SHAME\\" if their were not 10 seasons of this show made. Not many 1 Hour shows can grab every second of your sttention but this one can.Thats why so may shows are 1/2 hour ones today!!These shows are Way different but put this up there with \\"The Wire\\", most of \\"The Sopranos\\", \\"OZ\\" and so far..... Most of nurse Jackie and Weeds in shows that have Great Characters of all ages, wonderful writing,Almost always Believable in some way, Great Photography ad wonderful all around entertainment!!<br />My Honest suggestion would be to buy or \\"Get\\" the 2 seasons of Shameless already available and one of any of the others i have mentioned if you have not seen them and start watching. You will end up with all of seasons of all of them and wont be able to wait for the next seasons!!!! That is of course, if it is not finished already.<br /><br />WARNING!!!!<br /><br />This can end up taking alot of your time.

Then when I finally could visit a friend I hit another glitch which now superimposed his properties on top of mine.  I had buildings on land I hadn't even purchased.  I had advanced buildings I was unable to maintain because my experience level was so low.  Already uninstalled it.

B0051UP5NQ|2.0|Don't buy this application if you are expecting to actually see what is in a Word document.  Almost all of the formatting is lost.  You can open and edit a document, but once you save it, it completely destroys the original formatting.  It is pretty much an RTF editor at best, can't do anything more sophisticated.  FORGET complicated Excel formulae.
B0086700CM|3.0|at first this game is like WOW! but once you buy everything and get past a few million it gets pretty boring
B0037QM8YA|2.0|I will give the director of this movie credit for being willing to show such ugly, intense, abuse on screen and not gloss over it. However, I think there was too much profanity. Also, the main thing that bothered me is that I don't feel Precious was properly protected. I mean she told the social worker about some stuff going on in her house and her mom finds out and gets mad which is why they get in a fight. Tell me why is she still living there when she tells a social worker she has a kid by her dad? Also in the end  the social worker just gets up and leaves after talking to Precious' mom. I'm thinking to myself why isn't CPS doing their job? Why wasn't she put in a better home sooner?<br /><br />Also, I don't really feel like Precious' character exhibited much of the characteristics of someone going through that much abuse. Aside from the part where she broke down about having HIV, I expected more emotional portrayal from someone with a mother like that who is also the victim of repeated incest

B00846REIS|3.0|Day is a better writer, but I think 50 shades had a better story.  This book has a lot of similarities, but with \\"50\\" it is much more about control issues, BDSM, the contract, etc. Here you have two f'uped people who use sex to diffuse all uncomfortable situations, and I am really not sure if I liked it or not!  I guess this seems to be the \\"new\\" trend in romance?  Couple has a damaged past, then they fall into \\"obessesive\\" love to help deal with their past demons...blah..blah....I think I am going back to paranormal romances for awhile, I need some escape from all this harsh reality!
B000AYELVA|5.0|great movie. hard to find in stores so I use Amozon to find the movies I want . never have been let down by this company.
B005LAIH5O|3.0|This is the sequel to 2010's Clash of the Titans, which looks incredibly similar in all but the story details. This time, Perseus and his small band of adventurers search for a powerful weapon to drive back the Titan Kronos and keep him imprisoned.  In Clash of the Titans, Perseus had to battle Medusa in order to have a weapon to defeat the Kraken monster and to save the Princess Andromeda. In both films, Perseus goes up against surprisingly not-so-immortal gods and a slew of ugly, monstrous creatures attack humans with little-to-no way to defend themselves. Perseus is only half human though, as son of Zeus. And as Zeus' champion, Perseus becomes humanity's hero once again.<br /><br />I'm usually a fan of films and novels that take a unique approach to Greek mythology, but Wrath of the Titans takes it a bit too far for my taste. The same immortal gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades from the previous film suddenly become weak, easily injured and mortal - without sufficient explanation. The film starts out very slow with dragging dialog that doesn't really further the plot, which is unfortunate since the film's saving grace is the adventure and combat scenes. Despite its flaws, I still enjoyed the fantastic special effects and CGI creatures, action-packed thrills, and even a bit of humor.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features:<br />Maximum Movie Mode: Control your destiny and choose one of two unique experiences:  The Path of Men or The Path of Gods<br />o Focus Points<br /> § Battling the Chimera<br /> § Who Are The Titans?<br /> § Agenor: The Other Demi-God<br /> § The Cyclops Fight<br /> § Prison of the Titans<br /> § Minotaur: The Human Nightmare<br /> § The Heavens Raise Hell on Earth<br /> § Hephaestus: God of Fire<br /> § Lost in Tartarus' Labyrinth<br /> § Creatures of the Titans<br />o Storyboard Comparisons<br />o  Deleted Scenes and more<br />DVD disc: Feature film in standard definition

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All I can say is...it sure lived up to the hype!  Awesome series!  I was actually sad when it was over.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This album is excellent.  The Beach Boys sound as good as they did back in the 60's.  They can still write and sing as great as ever.  There are some really good songs on this CD.  Shouldn't be surprised though with Brian writing most of the songs, what a genius.  This cd is as good as any they have released.
B003XDZNNU|5.0|I love the lightness and durability of crocs, especially how you can just flip them on, walk a lot without discomfort and wash/wipe  them down if they get dirty. The only problem with all the crocs I have is they are not attractive and make my feet look like cinder blocks. AHHH- the shayna did not dissappoint. Unlike the bigger, wider cut shape of the original crocs that look like garden shoes, these are a more narrow, cut closer to the shape of the foot. So no big giant bubble feet. They also have a strap at the heel that , like many crocs is really where your foot ends , not all the way to back of heel. I have a narrow foot but wear a 6.5 - 7. I went with the larger size 7 and it was perfect. The back strap does not move but the strap across the foot does. If you have a very wide foot this narrow cut may have some points where it could rub ( can use ones advice and cut moleskin and add inside) but I would order up a half size if in between and if have a very wide foot may want to try up a full size. The cotton candy color was soft and not at all like a little kids shoe. I cannot tell you how comfortable, light, cute  these are and the rubber adds  a cushiony feel to the sole. When you walk your foot may move a little forward toward the top front of the shoe- another reason to go up a half or full size to accomodate for this. Crocs are  not supposed to be tight on your foot , a little wiggle room is good. I was very happy with this purchase but shoes are one of those things you need to try on  as our feet vary, but this style is a bit more narrow in cut so order up if curious. Great return policy if not pleased- and I believe the shipping was free.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|The movie was a great movie, and the fact that they used real navy seals instead of actors was great also.  The action was prefect.  Also the movie was deliveried in a timely manner, and it was brand new and even got it cheaper than it was shown to be.  Will use Amazon again.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|i have to admit that i could not even finish this book.  I never buy a book just because everybody is talking about it but a few girls at work were really into it so i thought why not.  I put it down and picked it back up a few weeks later thinking i might just not have been in the mood.  The line about him gasping because of her biting her lip...and then he gasped again a few pages later.  I just could not go on.  I'm sorry but men dont gasp like little girls, and if they do i dont want to read about it.  Yes i want the man to have feelings and not just be me Tarzan you Jane..but come on. Both of the characters just annoyed me...and i could not deal with any more gasping....If you want a good erotica try Laurell K Hamilton (her early Anita Blake series).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put the 50 Shades Trilogy down!! I read all three books in less than a week!! It is definitely racy, but not the raunchy read it has been made out to be. It is actually a romantic, love story with a little twist ;-)

1565234243|5.0|I have read this book cover to cover.  Unlike some of his other books the photographs are clear, sharp and not over illuminated.  Some have complained that the subject is limited to Native American's.  While it is certainly true that the example is a Native American, he frequently shows sketches of a variety of choices when creating the various facial features.  After all, an eye is an eye or a nose is a nose.  If you can do one that looks good then you can do one that represents the details of the type you are going for.  I personally have no particular interest in doing Native American's my interest is more on the caricature side of carving.  Nonetheless I have learned a lot from this book and highly recommend it.<br /><br />I have no idea if the publishers read these reviews, but given that his other books are frankly poorly produced and sell for over $100 in the used market, it would seem that republishing his other books would make sense.
0441018866|5.0|Best space-opera, sci-fi book I've read in many years.  Very interesting ideas throughout and characters I came to be fond of.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Oh. My. God.  What a truly horrific book.<br /><br />I taught freshman lit in high school years ago.  Even the essays that ended \\"and then the alarm clock went off and I woke up\\" were better than this drivel.<br /><br />Sorry, but when the writing makes even the sex boring, there is something tragically wrong.<br /><br />The only word I can think of to describe this book is \\"tortured\\".  And not in a hot, sexy way, either.<br /><br />I wish I could rate it MINUS five stars.  I wish I had my time and money back. I wish this woman had a lick of talent.  Nobody loves good erotica better than I do, but this was not good and was not erotica. It was just sad. Flaccid.  Embarrassing.

1439127700|5.0|Woody Allen once said, \\"I took a speed-reading course where you run your finger down the middle of the page and was able to read War and Peace in 20 minutes. It's about Russia.\\"<br /><br />Because I review a lot of books, colleagues ask me if I'm a speed reader.  I'm not. I read with pen in hand and am slowed down even further by reading memorable stuff out loud to my long-suffering wife/listener.<br /><br />But speed reading would have helped as I tackled this 641-page book. While the notes and index are over 100 pages, it still left 527 pages of serious reading. But a speed reader would have missed the juicy morsels, laugh-out-loud humor and the incredible connect-the-dots leadership lessons of recent U.S. presidents. (And my wife would have missed my constant interruptions.)<br /><br />Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duff, editors at Time, have delivered what they call \\"the first history of the private relationships among modern American presidents--their backroom deals, rescue missions, secret alliances, and enduring rivalries.\\" And let me add: the interplay and conflicts between their unique leadership and management styles. Even my colleagues outside of the U.S. will enjoy this book.<br /><br />This presidential behind-the-scenes read-a-thon starts with \\"Truman and Hoover: The Return of the Exile\\" and ends with \\"Obama and His Club: The Learning Curve.\\" (I read that chapter first--and I was hooked.) In between, there are 24 chapters with memorable match-ups like \\"Careful Courtship, Bitter Breakup,\\" \\"The Hazing,\\" \\"Blood Brothers,\\" \\"Two Scorpions in a Bottle\\" (Johnson and Nixon), \\"No Good Deed Goes Unpunished\\" and \\"The Rascal and the Rebel.\\"<br /><br />This book is a leadership case study on multiple levels. CEOs in transition (retirement, termination or promotion) will especially appreciate this revealing inside look at the new guy/old guy relationships in the Oval Office. The book will trigger all your emotions (as it did for each president): mad, glad and sad. Here's a taste:<br /><br />--George H.W. Bush, commenting on Bill Clinton's general lack of discipline and long campaign speeches, \\"A good leader sets priorities--he doesn't just list.\\"<br /><br />--\\"The most precious commodity of the United States of America is neither the gold bullion in  Fort Knox nor the launch codes in its ballistic missiles. It is the time of the commander in chief: there is only so much of it, and how it is spent shapes pretty much everything else.\\"<br /><br />--On Gerald Ford: \\"Worse, perhaps, even though he had inherited the title, the job was not yet his.\\"<br /><br />--Lyndon B. Johnson: \\"He moved Eisenhower's portrait to a more prominent position, so that it would be visible in the background of pictures of Johnson greeting various White House guests.\\"<br /><br />--Henry Kissinger on Egypt's president: \\"Sadat handled four American presidents with consummate psychological skill. He treated Nixon as a great statesman, Ford as a living manifestation of good will, Carter as a missionary almost too decent for the world and Reagan as the benevolent leader of a popular revolution subtly appealing to each man's conception of himself and gaining the confidence of each.\\"<br /><br />--Nixon: \\"The best politics is poetry, not prose.  Jesse Jackson is a poet. Mario Cuomo is a poet and [Michael] Dukakis is a word processor.\\"<br /><br />--Nixon: \\"It is necessary to struggle, to be embattled, to be knocked down and to have to get up. Renewal. Americans are crazy about renewal.\\"<br /><br />--On George H.W. Bush upon losing the election to Bill Clinton: \\"...at five the next morning [Bush] got out his list of several hundred people he needed to thank and reached for the phone. He got off sixteen hours later.\\"<br /><br />--Bush 41 (writing to his sons about Nixon): [per the authors, Bush's letter is] \\"as good a psychological profile of Nixon as any that exists. Nixon was a great leader, he told his boys, and a first-rate intellect but also a third-rate person.\\" Bush added, \\"He surrounded himself on his personal staff with people unwilling to question the unlovely instincts we all have--and that he has in spades.\\"<br /><br />--\\"History doesn't repeat itself, Mark Twain said, but it rhymes.\\"<br /><br />--Bush 41 offered new perks to the Club, sending National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft to personally visit every former president (Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan). \\"Scowcroft asked what, now that Bush was president, they might want in the way of regular briefings and other logistical favors. This was self-protection on Bush's part: he knew that his predecessors could be excellent allies on all sorts of issues; and regular briefings in advance of big decisions could keep them sounding supportive when reporters called.\\"<br /><br />After Clinton's election victory, he called on an aging Reagan at his Club office in Los Angeles. The Gipper had two pieces of advice for the young president-elect: 1) Go to Camp David and relax as many weekends as possible, and 2) Learn how to salute! \\"And so the 81-year-old Reagan proceeded to give the 46-year-old Clinton a private tutorial.

The unusual friendship between Bush 41 and Clinton, as they teamed up to address the tsunami and Katrina crises, was outside-the-textbook stunning. So much so that at a 2011 Kennedy Center event honoring George H.W. Bush, 27 members of the Bush family assembled for a family portrait and Neil Bush called for Bill Clinton to join the family photo!

B0086700CM|5.0|I heard this game was really fun so I downloaded it. It's really fun and addicting, but also hard. I think it's annoying when you are far out from the temple and there's no checkpoint and you have to start over. But I still think it's definetly worth trying out! I don't agree with recent reviews that say its bad because in my kindle fire it works fine.
076115678X|5.0|I discovered the Curly Girl method on the internet and was told to order the book if I wanted to really get a good grasp of all the information I needed.    The Curly Girl Handbook is well organized and gives you lots of great pictures to help you understand what you're reading. I read the whole thing in a couple hours and really enjoyed it. I learned a lot and have been a Curly Girl for over a month now. The methods explained really do work. If you are hesitant, check out [...] forums and look at some of the before and after pictures. I'm a true Curly Girl now and I love having hair that I enjoy rather than hate!

But my brother says he'll take it along for his trip to France so that he and my sister-in-law could watch it during their downtime or when they're not on a tour, so I guess he thinks it's worth his while to watch it. I think I've watched some snippets of it in Matt Lauer's interview with Adele and I think it is spectacular.
B008EQIJQO|2.0|Imagine for a second that you can't hear anything but a soundtrack and can only see black and white. Then someone offers you the ability to hear everything and see in color. Who out there wouldn't jump at the chance to experience the world in a more rich and vibrant way?<br /><br />The only reason I can see for someone in 2012 doing a movie in black and white with no spoken word is that the movie's merits can't stand on their own without a gimmick. Watching the first 30mins of the Artist was painful and really showed to me that most film critic's have the inability to differentiate between an artsy, made for critics, sundance j*rkfest movie vs one that people will actually sit through.<br /><br />The best advice I can give is read the reviews, but not for just what they say, but for how they review it. If you find the positive reviewers seem to like the sound of their own voice and you don't really care what aspect ratio was used, then maybe you're like me and should give this one a miss..<br /><br />Short Version:<br /><br />People who like this movie: Film critics, old people, people that like old movies, people that took a few film classes in college and think they're film critics.<br /><br />People who will likely be so bored they can't get past the first 30mins: Me, the 99% that don't care about aspect ratios and how many other Hazanavicius movies we've all seen..
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book is so terrible, I am ashamed of myself for reading it! What a waste of my money and my time! The author managed to make sex boring. How many different places can Ana and Grey find for their adventures?..on top of a piano, in the elevator, blah,blah,blah! Ana is such a boring heroine, and her thoughts and actions are so immature. She and Grey live in utmost luxury.No plot, nointerest, just sex. Save your time and money.

0345803485|4.0|I read many of the one star reviews and just wonder what these people were expecting??  It's a glorified romance novel and it's good fun - a nice quick read.  We're you expecting Shakespeare?  It's pretty damn good compared to most goofball romance novels, but the author is no literary genius.  No reason to be haters, people!
0393327655|3.0|The End of Faith: Religion, terror, and the future of reason, by Sam Harris, W.W. Norton, U.S.; The Free Press (Simon and Schuster), London, 2006; 336 ff.<br /><br />Religion is all about fear! For the meek, it's about the dreadful fate in eternal hellfire that awaits the non-believer. For the psychopathic fundamentalist, it's the perfect justification to slaughter those who are rational enough not to succumb to the terrible fantasies. This is what Sam Harris' book is all about. Harris is a graduate in philosophy from Stanford University and has a doctorate in neuroscience from UCLA. This book gives a graphic account of the evils wrought in the name of religion.<br /><br />Like other recent, prominent and forcefully atheist authors, Harris fiercely and fearlessly, as the N.Y. Times reviewer said, attacks the rational absurdities of religion and their awful consequences to us all. Every religion claims that it alone represents truth, so all other faiths are `repositories of error . . . Intolerance is thus intrinsic to every creed.' The point he makes strongly in this book is that we must not abandon rationalism in favour of `faith' when we think of religion, for `this is one of the principal forces driving us toward the abyss.'<br /><br />The title `The End of Faith' is a little ambiguous, for we all have beliefs and faith - even belief in atheism! However it is religious faith that Harris is attacking and in his opening chapter he is criticizing our lack of rationalism when it comes to religion. His second chapter is about the nature of belief in the general sense. His focus is on faith-based religion - religions that are based on man-made scriptures. The number of fundamentalist believers in America leads Harris to conclude that we `have grown almost perfectly intoxicated by our myths.' The idea of toleration and moderation in religion is itself a myth, for one person's road to salvation is another's road to hell. No other sphere of life - medicine, engineering, politics - `suffers the anachronism that still dominates our thinking about ethical values and spiritual experience.'<br /><br />Harris also has a whole chapter providing a critique of Islam. He singles out this faith because, as he says, most of the religious terrorists of the past few decades have not been Christians, or Jews, or Buddhists. They have been Muslims choosing to interpret their Koran as inciting them to exterminate the infidels; though, as Harris says, there are also passages in the Koran they choose to ignore that forbid suicide and sanctify life. Other factors provoking Islamic terrorism are not considered.<br /><br />So far, this tirade against dogmatic western religion echoes those of Dawkins, Dennett or Hitchens. However, unlike these other atheists, Harris accepts `that a certain range of human experience can be appropriately described as `spiritual' or `mystical' and that there also seems to be a body of data attesting to the reality of psychic phenomena'. However, for Harris, spirituality should be `deeply rational'. I'm not sure what that means.<br /><br />Although its theme is similar, I found this to be a much more troubling and less well balanced book than those of Dawkins, Dennett or Hitchens because of the unrelenting story of evil that Harris presents as the handiwork of religion and the excruciating detail he provides on its atrocities. Whatever the shortcomings of Dawkins' God Delusion, Harris' book cannot be called a balanced presentation either.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0446697966 God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything by Christopher Hitchens]]<br />[[ASIN:0415497612 Why Gods Persist: A Scientific Approach to Religion]]<br />[[ASIN:0802845088 Is Religion Dangerous? by Keith Ward]]<br /><br />Howard Jones is the author of The Thoughtful Guide to Godlitics - `suffers the anachronism that still dominates our thinking about ethical values and spiritual experience.'<br /><br />Harris also has a whole chapter providing a critique of Islam.

B004EPYZSK|5.0|Viewers who like westerns will enjoy this film. It has a gun fighter, many gun fights, Indians battling, references to acts during the civil war, and criminal bands. Those who like sci-fi will also like it. It has aliens who come to earth in search of something, which I will not reveal. They also kidnap humans. The film has the hero involved with two women at two different times. It also has two stories about the relationship of a boy and his father in one and grandfather in the other. It is suspenseful and well acted.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|I really like this game, you can create pretty much any type of restaurant that you want. As for the reviewers complaining about  having to spend real money... you do not have to! Your restaurant makes money (coins) as you play that you can use for buying items that cost gold coins. The items that cost GEMS you do have to buy gems with real cash, but you don't have to, you can totally play without spending one dime of your real money. And there are parental controls that you can set so that you or your child do not spend any money at all. And the site confirms with you at least 3 times before you purchase anything with your real money. It is not 1 click and you've spent a hundred bucks. Everything I've just stated IS IN THE GAME DESCRIPTION!!! Maybe it's just me but I read everything about an app before I download it.  I play this game almost every day and have for 6-7 months. You can absolutely play this game without spending any real money. Enough said. It is a cute fun game app and I would recommend it to anyone who likes decorating, food, and tycoon like games.

B007XH6BPG|1.0|Let me start by saying I am a big Yes and Chris Squire fan. I also own Chris' Fish Out of Water album and absolutely love it. That said, I have to honestly say that this album is a huge disappointment. The first track is pretty good. After that, there is nothing that interesting here. The lyrics are pretty weak, and the music doesn't really do much for me. I appreciate that Chris and Steve were taking a more melodic approach to these songs, but it could have been so much more. It may be that I am comparing it somewhat to Yes' latest effort, Fly From Here, which to me is their best album since 90125. However, I'd give this album a miss.

1451627289|2.0|Yes, I know. It's a strange triad for a review of a novel, but bear with me - not for as long as it takes to read the book, but for at least a short paragraph or two. First, though, I have to praise King for having given his \\"dear readers\\" many great stories in the past. But that's not what I'm here to say about this book.<br /><br />What I'm here to say is something that King knows and probably has written about himself: some novels are put away in the trunk because that's where they should stay. This novel, begun in 1972 and completed in 2011, as it was published, is one of those. (Although, perhaps, if he had had a better editor it might have been whittled down into a real gem of a novel - there are some unforgettable lines and images in the book. But alas, his editor, who probably stared into the eyes of the great man himself, just didn't have the steely nerves of Max Perkins.)<br /><br />Anyway, the first line of the novel is buried almost one hundred pages into the book, which is sad because that line is a doozy. The book is a behemoth and my first thought on receiving it was \\"Why didn't I get this for my Kindle Fire?\\" But, I've collected Mr. King's novels in 1st edition since Carrie and, until this book, I probably would have continued. But this monster was just too big. I couldn't hold it for longer than 20 minutes. It just weighed too much. Even War and Peace and my Riverside Shakespeare were easier on my hands. So, Mr. King, if your editor wouldn't edit or you needed everything, the answer would have been to serialize it. I paid almost $40 for the thing. I would have paid more for more books that were easier to hold.<br /><br />Moving on, and this is the most important part, on completing the \\"damned thing\\", at least you thanked Jack Finney. His \\"Time and Again\\" was an obvious influence. But the person you should have truly thanked was Harlan Ellison, who is still alive and often rather cantankerous about his work. King should have thanked Ellison, whose episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" is evident everywhere in the conclusion of this book. Ellison should be thanked. A lot.<br /><br />Finally, to those contemplating reading this book, I offer a few words of advice. Think about Kindle and saving your hands (unless you want to use the hard cover as a free weight for exercise), read Finney's \\"Time and Again\\" first, and, if you should finish King's free weight, watch Ellison's Star Trek episode. You'll know why.<br /><br />As an aside, I probably wouldn't have bothered with finishing this book if I hadn't been a victim of the great 2012 Power Disaster in the mid-Atlantic states and was reading a book every day. (I started this particular book when it was first released.) Either way, it may be the last King novel I'll buy and that's sad because, while often dismissed as a \\"pop\\" writer, King has some serious writing bones that should be remembered. But, alas, I digress. That's another topic entirely.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I brushed over some reviews and while reading a few of the lower rated ones it struck me as odd, though not surprised.  In the end, these are the folks and the rest of the SOF community, with support, who allow any of us to have an open opinion.  My wife and I saw this in the theater on a quiet, week night and enjoyed the humor, sometimes even dry that you may only understand if you have ever served with professionals. The tactics, dialogue and equipment are tight.  Even some of those who have or currently are serving, do not always get it nor will they know matter how it is described to them.  In my short time on this planet I have found those who usually never get their hands dirty have the loudest crow.  Hats off to SOCOM and an enjoyable and realistic depiction of what few can only imagine.  EOD 1&2

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|These magnificent heroes are not Spiderman, or Batman.  They are real Americans (SEALs) who will likely astonish you.<br /><br />They astonished me.  I'm no fan of shoot-em-up war movies, and no big fan of today's movies in general.  Typically, I'll watch a DVD for a while and then press \\"Eject\\" and go read a book.  But I watched this movie, spellbound, to the end.<br /><br />Why?  I wonder.  The plot is skimpy, but it WORKS, and it just flies by.  It's hard to talk about the acting, when most of it is done by real SEALs firing weapons.<br /><br />Perhaps it just comes down to gratitude, that America still has magnificent men like the SEALs, who keep the country safe by frequently putting their lives on the line.<br /><br />You may or may not know this, but every Peaceable Kingdom needs tough and ruthless border guards.  Why? is a question left up to the reader.
0486278077|5.0|Wow, what can I say about this book? The joy of it being free on Kindle is nowhere near how I felt when I was reading it. The description language is a bit old-school so if you are one of the YOLO generation the language might sound a bit 'biblical' to you. The conversations are the best part about the book especially when the cynic Lord Henry is involved for he speaks nothing but nectar to the ears.The plot is also interesting as Dorian tries to come to terms with his 'living' image.Spoiler alert, the ending is going to be what you are thinking its not.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Clint Eastwood does it again. He brings his bad-assedness to the screen in full force. I bought this movie for my girlfriend because we both love Clint's movies, and she loves this one in particular. She watches this thing easily once a month, sometimes more.<br /><br />If only I could get her to sit thru some of Clint's more obscure works, like 'Eiger Sanction' or even 'Kelly's Heroes' I think she would appreciate him even more.<br /><br />I would have given this movie 5 stars, if the Hmong acting wasn't so bad...<br /><br />Like my writing?

Yep, I wrote this...!<br />[[ASIN:B008C67ORQ Five Guise Burgers And Fries - How To Make Homemade Burgers And Fries Just Like The Pros (Canklefish Cafe)]]

My husband wanted to, but I said \\"no, let's stay with it.\\" MISTAKE! Ugh, so awful. Don't waste your time. This might be the worst movie I have ever seen. Really. I didn't even want to give it one star, but apparently you have to click at least one.

B0032UYFA6|1.0|I get suckered into a lot of lousy shows by the \\"hype\\" surrounding the show and all the glowing reviews on Amazon and in the media. This show is another one of those \\"con\\" jobs. Sorry, folks, but I found this show just plain lousy. It's depressing. It's glacially slow. The characters constantly bicker and fight in the most annoying ways. Almost all the characters are a-holes, jerky, uninteresting, unlikable, and unsympathetic. I disliked every single character on the show, especially Jesse, who has got to be the whiniest, most annoying, most unlikable character ever created for TV.  In short, this show was torture to watch. Sadly, the premise is good. It could have been a good show. The story idea was there.  But it is just written so poorly--unlikable protagonists, cliched bad guys, a story that moves at a snail's pace--so the promising premise is never developed into anything good. Even Bryan Cranston (who is a truly outstanding actor) seems bad on this show. His character has two notes, he's either bitter or angry. The people who should be bitter and angry are the people who get conned into watching this gratingly bad show.  And this season, Season 3 is especially bad, worse than the first two seasons.  Virtually nothing happens in the first 4 episodes of Season 3, these four episodes dragging on forever, as the \\"story\\" (or lack there of) focuses almost solely on a pending divorce between two characters (God is it boring).  Another bad episode later on is spent almost entirely in a hospital waiting room.  And then in another supremely bad episode, I swear to God, the whole episode is spent watching two characters try to kill a house fly!  Yes, the show is that bad!  And it eventually gets totally unrealistic as characters do things (like murder people or plot murders) which seem TOTALLY out of character for these characters on the show.  Season 3 just gets way over the top in the worst possible way.  And I've never seen a show with so many meaningless just-there-to-waste-time \\"filler\\" shots.  It's like every scene begins with meaningless time-wasting montages of landscapes or super slow panning shots.  This show is SO slow.  Badly written.  Badly edited.  Bad everything.  Avoid it at all costs.

0547569653|5.0|This is really an excellent book. I felt as if I was on the trail trudging through the races with Scott. It is amazing what the human body can do and how much Scott was able to push through when his mind and body wanted to quit. I read through the book in a few days and didn't want to put it down. I also liked the recipes scattered throughout the book. Very inspirational. I still am not sure how someone can run over 100 miles but he does it and does it fast 7 -8 minute miles. Scott shows how he wasn't the fastest, but had the determination to keep running long after the others would start to doubt themselves.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|I purchased for my 10 year old granddaughter and she loves it. It's cute and has a lot of cute details like the lockers with skull locks, cute jar with a frog, a pink skull disco ball and the cute additional stickers to name of few. The colors used on the school are great, they are not too dark and scary and overall the quality is good. I wouldn't call this an educational toy. However, we do see her role playing as the teacher and students in math or science class working out problems. My granddaughter would have like at least two more desks. I gave it a high rating because my granddaughter loves playing with it and is providing hours of enjoyment.

B007ZBWJXS|5.0|Four Word review:  GO BUY THIS ALBUM!!!<br /><br />I promise you will not be dissapointed.  It is simply a masterpiece.  Carl, Geoff, Steve and John have really outdone themselves, here.  Most reviews compare this to the debut, but that is hogwash!  Asia 1982 was great, dont get me wrong, but the band has moved on and there will never be monster radio hits like Heat of the Moment, Only Time Will Tell, etc, but I have to tell you, this collections of songs is amazing in their own right.  If given the chance there could be some radio hits here it just remains to be seen if they can get the promotion they deserve.

Eat and Run is written in a conversational style so it feels personable which makes it very difficult to put down.  I've also made several of his recipes and discovered some great new foods (the lentil-mushroom burgers are awesome grilled).  This is a great book and truly inspires you to run and eat well.

Charriere is known as Pappilon (Butterfly in French) because of the large tattoo on his chest. Here is a raw and engrossing story of human despair and desperation. Anyone attempting an escape from Devil's Island earns 2 years in solitary confinement. The second escape earns 5 years in solitary. Papillon's spirit is damaged by not broken and his determination is beyond belief.<br />Dustin Hoffman also stars as Dega, a notorious forger who befriends Papillon. Dega's stash of cash bankrolls Papillon's escape attempts. The chemistry between Hoffman and McQueen is evident as their characters became fast friends. Sometimes true stories are harder to believe than fiction and yet PAPILLON is based on fact.<br />PAPILLON probably was McQueen's role of a lifetime. Yes, he starred in several great films but PAPILLON proves what a talented actor he was. McQueen gets to use facial expressions and body movements to tell the story of a man who will not be broken. The wide-eyed look of amazement as Papillon is released from solitary is one of McQueen's finest.<br />We have an epic of a film that lasts 2 1/2 hours. It's a brutal look at a horrible prison system that many did not survive. Papillon escapes and is betrayed and captured and yet he never gives up. The version I have has a feature of the real Henri Charrierre's return to the long closed Devil's Island. Yes, the man survived.
B00005Q66T|3.0|Madonna gets 5 stars, but this CD gets 3.  The reason is she should've made an Immaculate Collection 2 that includes all her hits.  You can fit them on one CD.  At this point she's already done that with the \\"Celebration\\" 2 disc set which I recommend getting over this or even the Immaculate Collection.  That set has about 95% of the big songs that you need.  This Greatest Hits 2 is packed with great songs, but it leaves out key songs from this particular era, not to mention the order is scrambled and unorganized.  Remixes should've been included.  This was a pointless release and should've waited until \\"American Life\\" came out to ad those songs to this.  Oh well.  Love Madonna, but just not this particular CD.
B001I13PM0|5.0|In the midst of a major depressive episode, this concert yanked me from the depths with its vitality and absolute exuberance and had me in tears of joy in appreciation of it sublime brilliance. Sure it's 7 years later...this performance will almost certainly do the same in 70 more.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play this with several nonlinear friends and family members. Love this app. I don't think there is a better time waster out there!
0345803485|4.0|Well.. I am a guy.. and as such 50 Shades just is not my boat.  However.. the pure entertainment value of seeing my wife go gaga over this book.. and then immediately ordering the other two for her... Priceless.  Get one of the books guys... give it to the wife and have the other two on standby if she likes this sort of thing.  Mine did.. and the pay off was well... Priceless as well.  Made her very happy.
B00785P2QC|5.0|kind of messed up though making you write a review just to get invest points<br /> . but the game is fun.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Love all the variety but too many ads! I love having so many options and having something to play that's not online
B0083GOPSG|4.0|This movie was very interesting!  It wasn't entirely what I thought it would be, which was like a Rip-off of X-Men.  The story takes a much different turn and I really like the direction in how they chose to tell the story.  If you didn't like \\"Hollywood Homicide\\" or \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III\\" You'll like this movie!
030758836X|5.0|I have to admit that when I first started reading this book, I only got about 10 pages or so and had to stop.  It just felt too boring to me, so I went on and read something else with more action.  I decided I didn't want to waste the money I spent purchasing the book, so a month or so later, I started it from the very beginning again and this time I decided I would be patient enough to keep reading.  I AM SO GLAD I DID!  Wow....what a great story!  I absolutely loved this book.  I don't know what I was thinking when I stopped reading it the first time.  This time, I could not stop and it just kept getting better and better.  I was cracking up at times, shocked at times....but overall, I came away from reading this thinking that it was simply BRILLIANT.
006197806X|4.0|Pandemonium is the second book in the Delirium trilogy. Warning there will be spoilers for Delirium in this review. At the end of Delirium Lena and Alex attempt to escape to The Wilds. Alex sacrifices himself so Lena can escape. Throughout Pandemonium Lena is dealing with Alex's death and adjusting to her new life in The Wilds.<br /><br />Pandemonium is told from 2 different time frames. And for some reason it works. It almost feels like you are reading 2 different books, and in a way you are. I thought I wouldn't enjoy the altenating time periods. But I enjoyed it a lot. I didn't find it confusing, and was able to keep along with both stories. There are no numbered chapter either. Each chapter is either labeled \\"Now\\" or \\"Then\\" The Now is what is currently going on in Lena's life, and the Then is what happened when Lena escaped to The Wilds.<br /><br />The Wilds is definitely interesting. Now I personally would not be able to survive the Wilds. The lack of electricity and running water, immediately turn me off. I admit that I take these luxuries for granted, and this book definitely makes you think about that. The residents that Lena aligns herself with in the Wilds are definitely interesting. My favorite of them is definitely Raven. She is strong and tough as nails, basically a badass.<br /><br />But my favorite character is someone who is introduced in the \\"Now\\" part of the story. His name is Julian. Julian is a cancer survivor who is 18, but has not received the cure yet due to his cancer treatments leaving him a weak body. If he receives the cure, there is a chance that he could die. Julian's father is a political figure, and this puts Julian in the spotlight. Julian is considered to be a role model and leader of his peers and gives the message that if he's not afraid of the cure (even though it could kill him), then no one should. I simply adore Julian. Julian has this innocence about him, that makes him a very likeable. And when Julian meets Lena, just as you saw a change in Delirium when Lena met Alex, you start to see a change in Julian when he meets Lena.<br /><br />And in the \\"Then\\" part of the story you see this grittiness in all of the characters who live in The Wilds. They truly are fighting for not only their lives, but for something that they truly believe in...love. I think that's one of the things I really do like about this series. Love is such a powerful emotion, and you see what these people go through just to not give it up. The conditions they are willing to live in just to stay true to themselves is really inspiring. Also in the \\"Then\\" part there are some scenes that really just tug at your heart. One is particular is just written so well that I was tearing up badly and actually had to put the book down for a few minutes to compose myself.<br /><br />I admire Lena so much. She's so strong and has dealt with so much. But she somehow has the strength to keep going, and she's a good role model for young teens. I enjoyed this book so much. I actually was so into it, that I finished reading it while on a long bus ride to another state. I usually don't read in vehicles, because I get headaches. But I just couldn't put this book down. And the ending of this book just makes you very impatient for the next book in the series.when Lena met Alex, you start to see a change in Julian when he meets Lena.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. I cant stop playing it! I haven't put it down since I got it! no matter how old u r u will like it!
0312360258|5.0|I am very happy that when I started reading this series I was not a person who checked out reviews to see if I would like it or not. Not that I am now, but I wanted t refresh my memory a bit about the first HON (House of Night) book, and WOW does it ever have a lot of negative reviews. This book is a teen YA paranormal book, you need to remember that when you read this series. A lot of the characters act like teenagers, surprise! That aside, this was my first book that I read after the Twilight series that was also about Vampires (or Vampyres as they are spelled in this series) and what a huge difference. The Vampires in this series are a little more along the line of what people actually think when they think of vampires.<br /><br />There was something about Zoey Redbird that clicked with me and I was very drawn to her story and felt like I could really relate to her, Hence my nick name, Ashley Redbird. Vampires are not really hidden in the world of HON, but to be marked by one, isn't an ideal situation. Zoey ends up being marked and destined to become a vampire, but it isn't the life she planned on. Right away you can tell there is something special and different about Zoey and when she finally ends up at the HON school her head master also feels the same way.<br /><br />Zoey learns the ins and outs of becoming a vampire and learns that it is just as difficult as any other situation for a 16 year old girl, vampire of not. However with markings on your face, it makes this a little more challenging. Zoey learns many different things about herself and the school throughout the book, and learns she is more special than she ever thought.<br /><br />Although this book is more of the teenage side as far as the language goes, you can really put yourself into their shoes and remember how awkward being a teenager used to be, and we weren't even vampires!! I fell in love with series right away!! This is only the beginning of some really wicked stuff to come!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Most anyone will enjoy this simple yet challenging game. Especially if you enjoy real golf or mini putt games. Simple to learn, touh to conquer. Enjoy!
B005ZUR724|5.0|has the look and feel of wow great for my kindle fire. It may not have all the features but it seems like with work it could be the start of something big
B0086700CM|3.0|gets boring after a few days and the kindle does not have the glitches that gives tons of points.  :(
B00785P2QC|5.0|good game. great way to pass time. faint stop playing and strongly advise you download so you can see what I'm talking about
B001AQT11M|5.0|It came in time for my granddaughter to spend the weekend with me...and since she has this on VHS and has it memorized, the DVD was perfect!  Thank you for having it available!!!
B005HSL626|1.0|This is an OK game but the ads are just too much. I kept getting video ads that were longer than playing the game. You can't skip them and when they were over I had to back out of the game to get it to play again because the screen goes blank. All the downloading is using my WIFI connect data limit and slowing down the game.<br /><br />The game is repetitive and quickly can get boring especially if you have to watch all of ads. I am also not a fan of OpenFeint because of the space it takes on your tablet and it can also slow down its operation.<br /><br />I removed it from my device!
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a good app, especially if standing in long lines. It really makes the time fly by and I can ignore strangers wanting to chat.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|I thought the acting was good, but the ending left something to be desired. I don't like movies that end on a down note.
0316056863|3.0|Bossypants is light diversion. I was entertained, but not terribly informed. Like others, I felt it was thin soup made with too few ingredients and fairly watered down.  I got the idea that in the book, she would share grit (in an amusing way) about being a female boss in a male-dominated industry.  She doesn't really deliver that.  She did share anecdotes and splashes of her life, but to be honest, I felt I was reading about Liz Lemon.  Tina's writing voice is so similar to Liz Lemon's dialogue that it didn't help me get to that much substance about Tina.  I was disappointed about that, but still entertained by the writing.  The book would have kept me occupied if I'd been stuck in an airport on a long layover, so it really does have some value.  Therefore - 3 stars.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|We have been anticipating the release of this video so long that when it finally came out I ordered this one and the next day my wife ran out and bought one. We gave one copy to a friend and watched the other and it was awesome.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|free game with lots to choose from.  can be pretty challenging.  great way to take a quick break.  ads do get a bit annoying.  I would recommend this for everyone.

0062017926|5.0|I loved this book. I bought it together with all the other Sigma Force novels. I had trouble going to sleep at night because I didn't want to put this book aside. I'm looking forward to read Bloodline and I hope James Rollins will write many many many more Sigma Force novels.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I too, felt compelled to write a review. It's quicker to rate than review, but \\"holy crap\\" as our 'heroine' would say, I'm 'gasping' for a first-person review.<br /><br />Well, I so enjoyed more than three negative reviews I read, that I wanted to congratulate those writers for being 'bang on' - no pun intended.<br /><br />I too was curious about the rage for and against this trilogy, thinking that it was likely a simple bodice-ripper with unrealistic situations and language - and a heck of a lot of wishful thinking.<br /><br />One reviewer checked to see if the author was a teenager. I went the other way: she could be a clever, market-aware sales promoter. This isn't great writing. It's not literature. The author's not from the U.S. and misses out on the idioms and sentiments of 20-somethings on this side of the planet. Nope, they don't talk like their parents' generation, even if they had originated in, what, not Georgia, not Washington, but the author's England. In North America, I have never heard a 20-something say: 'moot' point. Nor have I heard them refer to a backpack as a 'rucksack' (in the same paragraph), among the variety of tossed-in phrases.<br /><br />The instant WOW-gratification of this the gal is hilarious. Really, we all may get a little titillated by the premise as we shake our heads at the unrealistic likelihood... and the confusion of what power and pain are.<br /><br />Do we sympathize for her or the 'hot' poor-little-rich-boy who commands an empire at his ridiculous age, yet can't still his soul?  Maybe if these two were as old as their idioms and as experienced with life (Really? Did he actually refer to 'old' and 'years ago' about his first mentor?)...<br /><br />Well, even with our negative reviews, someone's getting thrilled, and no one more likely than the author at $1.4 million a week right now.<br /><br />Sigh. Sigh. Sigh.

Story is based in Seattle, WA and the story line is so well written it makes you feel like you know these people and I find myself hoping for a real love story in the end. We'll have to see.<br />Seriously, this is an excellent and must read set of books.  Thank you for the great price Amazon.
0425263908|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately it was a bit of a disappointment. There are some good erotic moments, the story between them could have been richer, deeper , if you will...but over all a lot of holes through out the story line. Bummer!!
B0012BQ60O|5.0|The best quality for the money. My 3 year old drops, swims, throws, stomps ect on it and it does not fade, bend, change form, or break. It is so real to life and fun to play with. The price can not be beat.

The author is very funny, romantic, sarcastic, all the things I enjoy:) I actually have read it 3 times then went on to order her other books as well. I recommend her books for sure!
0307346617|5.0|The oral history angle really works for any apocalypse tale, but it really helped to flesh out all of the details.  It created an excellent vehicle for cutting back and forth between different characters telling their stories first person.  Also, there is fresh zombie stuff here... fresh ideas about the pathology, how and why it creates an apocalyptical scenario.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This show is great. I am 34 and lately there hasn't been anything worth watching in a long time.  I watched season one in two days and I was immediately drawn from the pilot.  Jesse is a great character. He and walt grow and have the greatest relationship. What I love most about this show is that there is mild cursing meaning there isn't any \\"F\\" bomb.<br /><br />I watched all these seasons on DVD for hours. It is addicting.  Season three is slow but still wonderful.  It ends with a bang!!<br /><br />I love jessee eyes..... lol

B005QJZ5FA|4.0|When I first heard her on Last.fm, I didn't know what her singles were.  I figured Video Games was a single, but I was surprised to hear that Born to Die and Blue Jeans were singles too.  They're pretty dull tracks compared to the rest of the album.  Off to the Races is probably my favorite, and a handful of other tracks (Dark Paradise, This is what makes us girls, National Anthem) have a \\"thing\\" going on that I like, but the track 'Born to Die?'<br /><br />I guess I'm just surprised at who likes what.  Glad to see she's getting lots of praise overall though.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />So I've had some more time to listen to the album, and I think the thing that sets her apart from a lot of artists (besides the obvious 'haunting,' sometimes very classic sound that carries across the album) is how she puts a lot of vocal nuances into every single word she sings.  What I mean is, you can hear personality and character no matter if she's singing a throwaway line in an average track, or the chorus to a hit single.  The songs are more personal, in my opinion, because of this attention to detail.<br /><br />And if you think she's just singing about money and boys, sounding as trashy as ever because it's her M.O., the theme of the album is pretty clear: it's more-or-less a concept album regarding her teenage years.  If you honestly think a girl is blatantly singing \\"give me them coins\\" in an attempt to point out how very much she only wants them coins, then you're either sorely confused, or you've been listening to too much Ke$ha.  Yes, this comment is based on a hater's review.

B006T3RM08|2.0|Loved this product for quite some time. It allowed me to type and &#34;mouse&#34; from my lap, which was very good for me ergonomically. However, it eventually lost its rigidity and became a problem rather than a solution. There were no discernible defects (no cracks in the plastic, for instance) on which to blame the change from rigid to flexible. I can only guess that the plastic softened or stretched due to the cumulative effect of the stresses of daily use. For what it cost, and the use I got out of it, it wasn't a bad deal, but I replaced it with a MeshWe Bluefin which, even after two years, works as well today as the day I bought it, so the Bluefin was money better spent.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is such. a cute game. Building the village is just adorable! Very relaxing!  The animation is great and visual.  Good for young and old!  Thanks to the creators of this fun app!
0765316994|2.0|Redshirts has a clever premise, and executes the whole \\"in parallel universes, which one is real?\\" question reasonably well.  But I expected better from Scalzi.  I know he has other jobs, I know he was chairing an important organization.  But this book was clearly thrown together to make this year's mortgage payments.  John, you can do better.
0345803485|4.0|While this book kept my attention, I found it pretty repetitive. Such as, every time she is in his arms, the point has to be made that he smells of laundry detergent, expensive body wash and Christian-ok we understand how he smells lol. My only problem with it is it's repetition. Other than that, it's a good book. I start the 3rd later today.
1451637500|2.0|Cryoburn is a very boring book.<br /><br />I've been a Bujold fan for as long as I can remember. I've read ever Vorkosigan book, all the Chalion books and the entire Sharing Knife series. I loved them all.<br /><br />But this book was a mistake. I think it was time to turn the Miles legacy over to the next generation and let some new blood carry the Vorkosigan legacy. Miles has a wife now, Miles has children, Miles has political responsibilies. Miles can no longer engage in the madcap, zany, high-risk craziness that was his trademark. So he sits and talks, and talks and talks. And the all the talk is generally pretty dull.<br /><br />The other problem with Cryoburn besides the endless, boring talking and the lack of action is the children and the animals. They add nothing to the story except fluff and filler. Personally I find that TV and movies are completely overloaded with Spielburg style precocious children. It's been done to death and it's no longer interesting.<br /><br />On the basis purely of reading enjoyment I'd give Cryoburn one star. But I'll boost it to two just because it's Bujold. I sincerely hope her next book returns to form. And if it's set in the Vorkosigan universe I also hope the focus is on somebody else besides Miles.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game that you can distract yourself with during the day. some of the controls you would hope would respond quicker but all in all entertaining.

0062197258|5.0|I just finished this fantastic book, and cannot recommend it highly enough for fans of suspense thrillers.  First time novelist Elizabeth Haynes delivers a frightening, effective look at domestic violence and the lingering effects that such trauma can create.<br /><br />This story is told in two parallel parts, alternating chapters.  Catherine Bailey is a young lady living a carefree single life, partying with her girlfriends, until she meets a handsome, mysterious charmer who is not what he appears.  Soon, Cathy finds herself afraid, alone, and desperate to escape her circumstances.  While this story is playing out, the reader is also following Cathy four years later, as she tries to recover from the nightmare her prior relationship turned into.  She has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, requiring her to constantly and repeatedly check to make sure her doors and windows are locked, and that nobody has been in her home.  She starts a new relationship, but is weighed down by the physical and emotional scars of her old relationship, made all the more difficult by the apparent stalking by her ex-boyfriend, who has been recently released from prison for his previous abuse of Cathy.<br /><br />This book gives an exceptionally realistic picture of domestic abuse, and also of the difficulties of living with OCD.<br /><br />This is not a book for the faint of heart, as it is violent in many ways.<br /><br />At the same time, it is brilliantly written, and the reader will burn through it, unable to put the book down.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
030758836X|4.0|The premise of this book is wonderful and well constructed.  As others, don't want to say more than I need to or I'll mess up the read.  The author did seem to lose her steam.  I kind of thought she couldn't get herself out of a corner.  But I liked it.  Right to the end.  She kept me thinking and on my toes along with her characters.
B000S0DDG0|4.0|For this to be Jennifer Hudson's first movie, she did an AWESOME job! I see why she won the big one! I didn't give it a 5 because there were certain areas where I came out from being lost in the movie due to under acting. Although Beyonce sang the mess out of 'Listen', her facial expression didn't seem believable singing it in the studio. 'Spoiler Alert' I loved her understanding-friend facial expressions she gave mad Effie when she thought Deena was taking her man, when she found out about the 'Baby', and when she was packing to leave Curtis (although the body language wasn't like a sistah trying to leave)LOL! So many good Beyonce scenes, but also several flat scenes as well. Always Love Danny Glover...that's what Acting looks like! I wish he had more scenes; he has a way of drawing you in and making you forget he is acting! Don't have much to say about Eddie Murphy, he was being 'Eddie Murphy'! Jamie Foxx's facial expressions at the end made me cry! I could have watched this movie for another 15min to find out what happens. I didn't cry through the whole movie until I saw the little girl cry! Amazon don't have a 4.5 so I left it at a 4. Hope this helps.
076115678X|5.0|It may sound a little overly dramatic, but this book changed my life (I first discovered it under the first edition)!  Before I found this book, I battled with super frizz and super unruly/unpredictable hair that my straight-haired mother and sister had no clue what to do with.  After reading this book, I learned how to take care of my \\"Botticelli\\" curls and now have minimum frizz and tons of compliments!  It makes sense that someone with curly hair have a completely different hair routine than someone with straight hair.  I got a few jeers and sideways glances when people found out I didn't use shampoo after reading this book; however, the results spoke for themselves as my hair transformed into its natural splendor.  And I never once had someone complain that my hair smelled bad because I used conditioner in the place of shampoo...quiet the opposite, actually!  I had a guy in high school who told me he loved sitting behind me because my hair always smelled so nice.  A little creepy, but it just proves the point that you won't be \\"gross,\\" \\"nasty,\\" or \\"smelly\\" if you ditch the harsh sulfate-salt-laden common shampoos for this \\"Curly Girl Method\\" of cultivating your curls!
B00785P2QC|4.0|great game that could use some touch ups. I always run out of energy and good and it is slow going but overall a great game.

0224064916|4.0|We love Roald Dahl, but sometimes the intensity of the insults being hurled around is not right for little children.  This book, while full of gross-out and ridiculous situations, avoids the flaming rage and ugly insults of many of Dahl's more famous books.<br /><br />I read this aloud to my kids and we all enjoyed it.  Give it a try.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|engaging game and really like the graphics.  the characters are fun and the setup is easy to do and you are able to get points and money fast.
0345803485|1.0|I am completely blown away that this book made it to any kind of best sellers list. Her writing sy is that of a junior high schooler. Whoever edited this book must have taken ecstasy to get them through it and then to think that someone actually published it floors me! To be honest, I couldn't get past chapter 9 before I finally gave up.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I love this app, its a wonderful player, works just like play music on nexus  s and even works with headset and native lock screen controls. I would like the ability to upload to my cloud player from in app though so that I could easily share playlists between multiple devices.

0618918248|3.0|Dawkins is an excellent writer and brilliant story teller.  His book is an interesting read and should be considered a core book for someone who wants to study both sides of the Atheism/Theism debate.  The gist of the book can be summarized in just three premises: #1 Dawkins (over) asserts Natural Selection can explain all complex organisms, #2 Natural selection cannot explain God therefore #3 God does not exist.    The book has many misleading statements.  For example, Dawkins claims it's possible to build a historical case that Jesus never existed as all and quotes a professor supporting that position.  However, he fails to disclose his sole expert is a language professor who has no credentials as a historian.  In another example, he uses an illustration of surviving death from a firing squad of ten people as an analogy to explain the unlikely odds of a universe suitable for life which Stephen Hawkins calculated at \\"a hundred thousand million million\\" to one.  Thus, while his arguments are well written and sound convincing, they are quite misleading to equate the odds of a few men on a firing squad missing their mark with odds of a hundred thousand million million to one.    Despite these kinds of misleading quotes and analogies, I would still recommend Dawkins' book since it plays so prominently into the debate.  However, I would caution to balance it with a less biased opinion like Allister McGrath's, The Dawkins Delusion or, if you would like a quick review you can check out my own at [...]
0143120530|5.0|Book was through and went into many mind tricks for recalling events, names, faces and numbers.  Some were out of this world and I cannot imagine going to that much effort to recall anything.  Others were less cumbersome.  The writer chronicled his foray into the world of competitive recall competitions and what it took to become a champion.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love these books. At first I was a little nervous about these books because the first book is so risky! It really has a good story line if you can get through the first book and look beyond some of the risky business... The story line keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. I loved the way the books keep me wanting to read them. I enjoyed the characters and wanted to continue reading them.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|I have never rated a movie on Amazon before, but I felt I had to say this is a tour de force performance for Tilda Swinton.  She is outstanding.  This is a gut wrenching story for sure, but you can't take your eyes off Swinton.  She is THAT good. Those folks who are rating this as a one star film are the same people who gave five stars to Project X, so take their criticism with a grain of salt.  If you like powerhouse performances and enjoy unique films with high quality actors, then you will not be disappointed in this movie.
B004Q9T4E4|3.0|\\"Civilization\\" covers similar ground as [[ASIN:0679720197 The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers]], [[ASIN:1565115147 Guns, Germs and Steel]] and [[ASIN:0393318885 The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor]] - albeit with considerably less depth and nuance than any of these works - in order to examine what has enabled \\"Western\\" economic and military superiority over other cultures and civilizations over the last 500 years or so, and determine if this era is about to end.  \\"Civilization\\" appears to have been written with the sort of reading audience that doesn't normally consider these issues in depth in mind (and written somewhat hastily as well, it appears) - while I must admit there were a few unexpected surprises (I found the description of how totalitarian economies appear to recover rapidly from the Great Depression by suppressing consumption and forcing high rated of personal saving to be particularly clear and insightful, for example), it didn't appear to provide enough detail or context to satisfy the serious student/reader in international affairs (although it was enough to keep me occupied on a long international flight), or occasionally significantly overstated its case (just how important is a growth in Christianity within China?  I would suggest somewhat less than what Ferguson claims). It would probably be interesting for the intelligent reader who hasn't been exposed to this sort of literature (or thought about these sorts of issues) before, and a worthwhile (albeit incomplete - reflecting a more slightly more \\"popular history\\" and less scholarly approach than even [[ASIN:0465023290 Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power]] or [[ASIN:0143034790 Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire]].<br /><br />Oh, and did anybody else find the \\"killer apps\\" meme silly and distracting?

B004QL7K8E|5.0|I was expecting this movie to be about sex, drugs, alcohol, and partying. Although it is, it turned out to be much better than that. The movie actually has a story line, and isn't just 1 hour and 30 minutes of nonsense. 100% not a family movie.

0553386794|5.0|Where to even start. I was so emotional towards the end of the book, I couldn't decide if I wanted to hang George R.R. Martin by his toes or hug him. The beginning was slow going but drew such detailed pictures of the characters you felt like they were right there in front of you. I couldn't wait to dive into the next book, which thankfully, I had sitting right next to me.
B008FC4WA4|2.0|Nick Hornby's characters are wonderfully flawed and the prose is full of wit and dark humor. Unfortunately, the story goes nowhere. We discover who these people are, but nothing ever comes of them. There's a hint that the main character makes some sort of self-discovery, but it's not poignant enough to stick.<br /><br />I love A Long Way Down, About A Boy and Juliet, Naked because they are about characters trying to grow or survive the craziness of life. This short story is just about a character existing and something embarrassing happening to him. There's some introspection, but no growth. While that might be realistic, I don't find it satisfying to read about. I finished the story feeling like I wish someone had told me there was no point in reading it.
B006G2ZEV6|2.0|In this game you play as the attacking side of a tower defense type of game. I found that this game gets very boring very fast. I lost interest after the 3rd level. I would recommend buying something more worth you're money/time.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I got this for my 5 year old daughter for her birthday. She got it just in time and was very exciting when she got it. I bought it used and it was like new. She still watches it and I like the little edition that comes with it as well. They added a scene with the movie having all of the magical items in the castle sing 'Human Again'. Very exciting addition indeed!

B0079XPUOW|3.0|I am a big fan of Old Man's War timeline and have read everything written in that universe. I was excited to read something different from Scalazi, but this book really fell flat with me. I did not feel attached to the characters and the comedy was simply not funny to me. I would highly recommend reading the first 4 chapters here [[ASIN:B007NJPO2A Redshirts: Chapters 1-4]] All in all I am still happy to support a great writer.
B002BZOVLG|5.0|Since I didn't know some of the singers, I wondered how good this would be despite all the good reviews.  Well, it's superb.  (I bought the Blu-Ray.)  There's not a weak link in the cast, and it's good to see young singers playing young roles.  Ivan Fisher does a good job with the orchestra.  The staging is just as it should be:  fluid, detailed, coherent, and engaging.  (I don't often find myself saying that!)  My only complaint is that occasionally the English subtitles are too generic, gliding over nuances in the libretto.  Overall, a real winner!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked it up based on the reviews and they were right. Excellent characters and an enthralling story. Highly recommended...
B00127RAJY|2.0|The workouts themsevels work great to \\"shred the weight\\". There are 3 separate workouts increasing in intensity and you can choose which workout (level 1, 2 or 3) you want each time you boot up the disk. Even level 1 was a great workout. I lost 10# in 1 1/2 months using only level 1. HOWEVER, the workouts involve a lot of jumping jacks and lunges. Check with your dr. first before starting (the video stresses that you should do this also) and modify the routine as needed. I ended up injuring my knee (no previous injuries to it) from the workouts, which my orthopedic surgeon and physical therapist told me was due to jumping jacks putting 9 times your body weight on your knees which my \\"older\\" (I'm middle 40's) knees just can't take, particularly since I'm on the heavy side (190#). 4 months later and my knee still isn't healed after numerous Dr. and physical therapy visits, which likely means surgery next. I've since given the disk to a friend who has told me she really likes it. Bottom line: Effective workout; modify the jumping jacks and lunges to save your knees!

B005GP7F8Y|1.0|The master source for the Blu-RAy is the same old crappy picture quality that's been put on the DVD for years..<br />Maybe One Eyed Jacks will be honestly re-mastered  properly someday. Amazon was nice enough to send a return label.
B002ZDOXLW|5.0|Love this album!  I can't say enough about this woman's voice (and music).  Amazing!  I saw her in concert years ago and she is just as good in concert as she is on her albums.  If you get a chance to see her in concert (not sure when she will be touring in North America again), it is well worth it.<br /><br />Her lyrics are also very original and you can tell she has put a lot of thought into them, not just put words together so that they rhyme.<br /><br />My favorite songs on this album are Penelope's Song and The English Ladye in the Knight.  I can still remember her ending the concert with Penelope's Song.  Just beautiful.<br /><br />If you are a fan of her previous albums, give this album a chance.  I think you'll like it.

0345803485|1.0|Just finished the novel 50 shades of grey and feel compelled to write a review on how awful and distasteful this book is written. I was so anxious to read this book as everyone has been raving on how mind-blowing and brilliant it is. One thing I can say is yes it is mind-blowing how it ever got to be a best seller is beyond me. For a start it's shocking that a book with no substance at all can actually be as thick as it is. And as for it being a turn on and kinky I find it hard to believe that you would find such a sadistic and farfetched tail of sex pleasing. This book is poorly written, repetitive and in no way possessing. I absolutely adore reading books and was hoping for a complex written novel making your imagination run into overload however it failed to do so, and was in fact so basic it was a chore to actually get through. I can quite easily say this is the worst novel/book that I have ever read and just to think there is actually a trilogy confuses me as there is no actual reason for there to be. My review is my own opinion and I hope people find it helpful.

B002L6I9Z4|1.0|The outer case is very durable, the lens cleverly protected from little fingers, but almost every single picture we've taken with it results in a \\"file error.\\" Since my 3-year-old daughter isn't really taking particularly great pictures, this is no great loss, but instead of letting the child continue to snap photos, the camera becomes unusable with every file error, until you go into view mode and manually delete the picture (and sometimes several before it). So my daughter can only take one picture at a time, and has to constantly hand it to me to be fixed. It frustrates her intensely. I think we would have been better off with an old used camera or buying the cheapest regular camera. The price on this camera is absurd for something that does not actually function as a camera in even a minimal way.
B005LAIGF0|2.0|First of all - surprise! - the Theatrical Cut is superior to the Director's cut, which feels like an early assembly full of sloppy editing and unnecessary longeurs. One wonders if Fox released this version simply to embarass Lonergan, following their high profile falling-out... Quite possible. In any case, that the director had to borrow $1m to complete the editing of his version is a wastefulness to rival Lehman Brothers (an NYU student could've done a better job on their laptop for a dime).<br /><br />As for the film itself - surprise again - it fails to live up to the hype. Lonergran is actually an okay writer, his characterizations frank and three dimensional, and his narrative is compelling enough on first viewing, if unsubtle. Perhaps a great director, a Malick or a Scorsese, or indeed an Antonioni (whose work this superficially resembles), could've delivered something genuinely profound here. Sadly, in Lonergan's inexperienced directoial hands, Margaret never rises above the level of an upmarket cable movie-of-the-week, a splurge of uber-bland coverage and histronic performances, poorly paced and further weighed down by a portenious score, cliched use of slow-motion and an unjustified air of self-importance. Ruffalo and Damon meanwhile are wasted in tangential roles, although it must be said that Jean Reno delivers his strongest performance in years, albeit again only playing a minor character.<br /><br />The final result then is little more than tiring Oscar-bait of the Crash variety and, in a strong year for American cinema, there's no need to waste your time with this: watch instead The Tree of Life, Hugo, Into the Abyss, Mildred Pierce, Texas Killing Fields, The Descendants and/or Sucker Punch.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you are a dog owner, you must read this book!!  Eventhough some parts of it will be tough to get through, in the end it is well worth it.  Every time I look at my dogs now, I have even more respect for their inbred loyalism to their owners.  You will believe that you know what they are thinking after reading Enzo's keen insights into the canine and human mind.  Taking the time to read this gem will make you appreciate man's best friend all the more.

B0083F5J7S|5.0|Maroon 5 is one of the few bands I still buy entire albums of. This album definetly shows the band's diverse musical influences from jazz inspired songs to dance songs.  The cover of the Prince song is a great rocking out jam and shows Adam's strong vocals and his wide range.  I had to listen to this album a few times through to really appreciate all the creative aspects the band has put into this album. Some may feel the band has been lost in the more radio friendly songs on this album but I do not agree. The band is still there, they always had a funk about them and this album definetly has that vibe.  If anything this album reminds me of their earlier albums, and something I have been waiting for since their 2nd album \\"it won't be soon before long.\\"

B007P6VLRS|2.0|First, this disclaimer:  This is a band that have loved for nearly 20 years. The first five albums (Gish, Siamese Dream, Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness, Adore, Machina) as well as their compilations (Pisces Iscariot, Aeroplane Flies High) make up the true Pumpkins canon.<br /><br />But that band ended in 2000, leaving greatness behind. And while there have been a few moments of goodness (not greatness) since reforming in 2005, this band has never fired on all cylinders since that original lineup (Billy Corgan, James Iha, D'arcy Wretzky and Jimmy Chamberlin) parted ways.<br /><br />As much as I hate to say this, Oceania is further proof that it is time to retire the Pumpkins. Call it whatever you want, just please, don't call this Smashing Pumpkins. Mike Byre, while a solid drummer, is no Jimmy Chamberlin and Jeff Shroeder, while proving he has guitar chops, never matches up to the visceral sharp guitar work James Iha brought to the band.<br /><br />Oceania has been hailed by many as a \\"return to form\\" and their \\"best since Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness.\\"  These comments are grossly misinformed. True, at a first listen or two, there are hints of the old Pumpkins, times when you think \\"almost.\\"  But those hints are hollow and what you are left with is \\"almost, but not quite\\" for the majority of this record.  I certainly recognize the sound of the old Pumpkins will naturally evolve, and I could even get behind a new sound.  If it were a good sound.<br /><br />Musically, this album is slightly better than average.  More interesting than it's predecessor Zeitgeist, American Gothic EP, as well as anything in the thus far Teargarden cycle.<br /><br />Rockers like \\"Quasar\\" \\"Panopticon\\" and \\"The Celestials\\" hopefully sear with the blistering, distorted guitars I've come to know and love about the Pumpkins. \\"My Love is Winter\\" and \\"Pale Horse\\" successfully highlight the somber, introspective side of the Corgan.<br /><br />Then there is everything else.  Namely, the synthesizers, which ruin any potential this album may have otherwise had.  \\"Violet Rays\\" harkens to 1980's 8-bit video game music, or worse, like a trailer for a bad epic action movie. \\"One Diamond, One Heart\\" sounds easily as though it could be a on a commercial for a credit card of jewelry store. The first half of \\"Pinwheels\\" could fit on a Manheim Steamroller record and the bloated title track \\"Oceania\\" starts with wispy synths and then mid-song borrows obviously from Goblin's work on the Suspiria soundtrack and then basically becomes an entirely different song.<br /><br />\\"The Chimera,\\" \\"Glissandra\\" (which seems to be channeling My Bloody Valentine), \\"Inkless\\" and \\"WIldflower\\" are about as middle-of-road, bland Pumpkins as you can get.<br /><br />But my real problem with this album, are the distractingly bad lyrics.  Corgan, who used to be somewhat of a poet, has gone soft.  I understand that perhaps Billy is in a  better place in life now and writes from a more optimistic perspective.  But he's just not doing it well. So the result is one of two types of song: 1) Super optimistic, cheesy like lyrics such as \\"'everything I want is free' and \\"I'm gonna love you 101%\\" (The Celestials) and \\"you don't deserve me but I deserve you\\" (Pinwheels) or 2) or lyrics that seem to be rehashed versions of lyrics written before: \\"And I'll leave with anyone this night\\" (Violet Rays) closely resembles \\"And I'll do anything to keep her here tonite\\" (In The Arms of Sleep)<br /><br />There is nothing here that has not already been done better by Billy Corgan on past Pumpkin records. Which leaves this album feeling like a desperate attempt to recapture the 'glory era', but with songs that speak more loudly than ever that era is long gone.
B0083GCK5G|4.0|I didn't grow up listening to the beach boys but I do love the history of rock and the beach boys made a major contribution to music. I've heard almost all their songs and a few of their past hits are some of my favorite songs that I listen to often. This album is great and still has the classic beach boys feel to it. It isnt quite.as good simply because a few members of the band have passed away and their voices are noticibly missing.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow! There are some seriously uptight people writing these reviews. I am not a big reader but with this series I couldn't put the books down. I read all three in less than 4 days.<br /><br />It is a fiction book, so yes, it is not exactly believable. But the point of reading fiction, watching soaps, or watching a good chick flick is to escape reality. Who would want to read a book based on every day life with unattractive characters? Not me :)<br /><br />I thought the author did a very good job with painting a visual picture of Ana and Christian. The back story of Christian was heart wrenching. He came from such a broken past and yet was able to open his heart and let Ana in. The sex scenes were intense. Yet Ana was never forced to do anything she didn't want to do, as she opened her mind and let Christian take the lead.<br /><br />Finally, sex that was interesting to read about and wasn't the same old \\"he made love to me\\" boring nonsense. I was so turned on after reading these books that I went to my local adult store and picked up a couple new toys.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey has a great balance of romance, drama, sex and unconditional love. If you are looking for an escape from reality and a way to spice up your love life, you can't go wrong with her three books.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I loved this book. The author did an amazing job of bringing the characters to life and the story was filled with raw emotion. As I read I felt like I was being pulled into the world of Will and Lake, it was a great escape - well worth a look :)
B007AJFSJW|1.0|...how is spending money we (USA/developed nations) don't have (aka taking on debt) going to solve our problem of too much debt? Oh right, because we will \\"grow\\" our way out of the problem... but what if demographic dynamics are on autopilot, while excruciatingly low interest rates punish the savers (historically, the good guys/gals and defenders of capitalism - that's clearly debatable, but I'm taking a side here)? ... how's Japan been since 1991?<br /><br />Seen another way: Imagine partying harder than ever before, to the point of getting terribly \\"sick\\"... to what extent does further drinking alleviate the problem? Hair of the dog is great for a short term fix...but to actually regain vitality? One needs to SLUMBER (recess/depress) and importantly, good \\"sleep\\" requires adequate (>1%), low risk returns on savings .............unless you're a (Buddhist) monk, but then you wouldn't have been drinking/partying in the first place...<br /><br />Am I saying we should bury our heads in the sand? Absolutely not. I don't disagree that government capital allocations could be significantly improved.<br /><br />Remember: government should act like my assistant, not my boss.<br /><br />wake up, Paul.

When this movie first came out I was a freshman in college so I could relate to the main characters sence of pressure.  Granted, I didn't have a killer pimp after me.

B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I never saw this movie until I purchased my Blu-Ray copy. The visual and audio quality is phenomenal. I really like how Disney built up the scene when first entered the world and was forced into a disc battle. The music & CG combined with a large LED screen & 5.1 surround sound almost makes the experience seem so real. All-in-all a great movie to watch. I purchased my copy from DEBSBANKSCRAP through amazon.
